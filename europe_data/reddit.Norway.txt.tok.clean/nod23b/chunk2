  thanks for the trip to the past , i 've heard the song before . 
   at least with some tens of people employed okay , i expected to hear something along those lines . 
  most companies are much smaller than that here as well . 
  without the shared canteen it would be sandwiches etc. 
  for most people it would take too long to go home . 
  if you go home for lunch , do you get to talk to your colleagues outside of work ? 
  for us it 's crucial to speak informally to our colleagues at work about all kinds of matters . 
  it 's often the best time to discuss issues and find solutions . 
  lanzarote , but it 's a while ago now . 
  as it should , as it 's [ proven to be ] ( http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20160112-in-sweden-you-have-to-stop-work-to-chat ) some of the most productive interactions employees can have at work . 
  i 'm used to lunch in the company 's canteen , the building has a shared canteen for all the tenants . 
  a range of cold and warm dishes , salad bar , bread ( various ) , drinks , a proper caf\u00e9 , etc. 
  does your father work for/by himself ? 
  yeah , i know , i lived for a while on your islands , 
  i 've read a few blogs about expats in germany . 
  many of them commented that the bigger lunches worked better for them after a while . 
  you 're just accustomed to another way i guess . 
  when do you eat dinner ? 
  blasphemer !, 
  back to w\u00f6rk with you !, 
  there 's no one solution obviously  you guys do n't have our short days during winter , or long days during summer for example . 
  yeah , i 'm just referring to an article in ft or similar about us companies looking at relocating to ireland [ for their european subsidiaries ] . 
   you wan na see real guerrilla warfare ? 
  look to turkey . 
  in terms of causes , it 's comparing apples and oranges . 
  you guys are fighting a war against an ethnic minority . 
  at least it 's a bit more legitimate than the criminal losers that believe they 're suddenly religious warriors . 
   giving a shit about warnings ... 99 % terrorists en route to syria or europe has to pass . 
  all of the latest attacks were perpetrated by people that were already here ... one of the guys from belgium was reported by turkey , but he did n't even get to syria . 
  it 's great that you 're stopping the others though , but i seriously doubt erdogan is our ally or friend . 
   the eu widely wont there will just be one agreement though if any . 
   the french have the illusion that if the uk leaves paris will become a financial centre that london is paris ? 
  i 've never heard any alternative to germany in that context . 
  if anything the germans will see more money and influence . 
  other services are likely to end up in ireland from what i 've read . 
   the eu would act like an irrational , petty ex lover . 
  i think they might , at least for a few years afterwards . 
  ah , that makes slightly more like ours then . 
  i believe serious disease or accidents are covered by our nhs . 
  it 's the regular checks , fillings and crowns that are n't covered here . 
  we 're talking about it though , but we have enough on our plate as it is . 
   education is a priority everywhere . 
  yes , of course , it 's just very costly and keeping it afterwards is problematic ( brain drain )  is university free in czechia ? 
  oh , this thing again , they say `` europe '' when they mean france . 
  jews have legitimate reasons for fleeing france after all . 
  it 's disingenuous if not worse !, 
  on the other hand [ germany is attracting israelis !, 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/middleeast/in-exodus-from-israel-to-berlin-young-nations-fissures-show.html?_r=0 ) i do n't see huge numbers leaving the uk or sweden ? 
   china is more capitalist than you may think i said democracy , not capitalism . 
  it 's hard to perform unpopular reforms in democratic countries because the governments will fall . 
  there 's always some political party that 's willing to opposite it for their own short-term gain . 
   all builded without huge subsidies from the state . 
  we need more investment to expand though . 
  sorry , i was n't referring to investment in existing businesses . 
  i meant the most valuable investment a country can make ; education and research . 
  i believe growth requires proper infrastructure , a stable business climate and an educated work force . 
  it probably helps to have risk willing , seed capital or venture funding available . 
  hehe , i could n't let the opportunity go  ironically , i know the nhs includes dental , it 's not free over here . 
  they are and i doubt any democracy could do it . 
  haha , yeah , i can see it happening . 
   if china , with its 1.3 billion people , is pushing forward innovative economy , they have cash to spend and a huge domestic market . 
  their leaders are willing to do it at any cost and despite any opposition . 
   got to laugh at the way ` true finns ' has been englishized . 
  it 's the original english name for the party [ used on their old webpages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finns_party#cite_note-14 ) : - `` the name ` true finns ' was previously used by the party itself and is still sometimes used by the international media , but this was considered insulting by finns who are not members of this party . '', 
  [ the party 's pages in swedish ] ( https://www.perussuomalaiset.fi/kielisivu/pa-svenska/ ) use the name `` sannfinl\u00e4ndarna '' . 
  that seems like a literal translation ? 
  i think you need better glasses . 
  i 'd rather live in czechia , than moldova . 
  poland over russia etc. 
   factoring in cost of living ? 
  do n't forget that it 's a lot more expensive in russia today . 
  it does sound logical , but [ the field is pretty cramped already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_competitiveness_report#2015.e2.80.932016_rankings ) . 
  it takes a lot of investment and time to build the same kind of society - and then you get to compete with both the high and low cost countries . 
  as he 's english i suppose because all of the prostitutes had teeth ? 
  i found a source confirming my suspicions here : '' [ inuit greenlanders face chilly life in denmark ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2013/0116/inuit-greenlanders-face-chilly-life-in-denmark ) '' . 
  i think you misunderstood the `` frosty reception '' issue . 
  it 's not really surprising when they 're seen as a source of problems . 
  greenlanders in denmark are associated with binge drinking , substance abuse , and social problems . 
  some mental health problems and homelessness . 
  it 's widely believed that most greenlanders are on public assistance . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2013/0116/inuit-greenlanders-face-chilly-life-in-denmark ) ), 
  they mentioned in the video that there was a perception issue in denmark ( [ about 2:03 `` prejudice '' ] ( https://youtu.be/qaeoe-_vype?t=116 ) ) . 
  that 's not racism , it 's an image problem . 
  do many greenlanders end up on welfare in denmark ? 
  social problems ? 
  drunkeness ? 
   culturally/socially/economically , they 're closer to the nordic states ( sweden/norway/finland ) it 's a stretch !, 
  they 're about as close as sudan in my opinion . 
  culturally and socially they 're nothing like us . 
  economically , they 're almost entirely financed by denmark . 
  i do n't see them being `` close '' to us in any sense ... 
  hi there !, 
  wan na come over for a bbq [ on the beach ? 
  ] ( http://www.supercoolbeaches.com/sites/default/files/ramberg-beach-norway.jpg )  we 'll be ready in a few decades . 
  i found a source and proof that you 're wrong  `` en vanlig m\u00e5te \u00e5 sammenligne levestandard p\u00e5 , er \u00e5 m\u00e5le bnp pr . 
  this belies the fact that we have a fta with the eu ... and pay for it . 
   did n't norway have exactly twice as high gdp per capita than sweden i do n't remember it being that high . 
   create stronger metropolitan areas , where scandinavians could thrive better in . 
  absolutely . 
  it 's a loss for the state that financed the citizen 's education though , but great for the individual .
