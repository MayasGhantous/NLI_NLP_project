  i have [ now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-qylyb6oo ) for [ certain . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le3cbrlwse8 ) i wonder if i 've heard songs in this dialect . 
  many words are quite similar to my own language . 
  out , boat , house , hands , home , children ( barn ) , mouse etc. 
  it 's the north east after all ... only a stone 's throw away !, 
  yes , of course , but you do have more variety than just english  my brother studied in your country and came back damaged for life !, 
  sorry , it was a joke about your language  once you join the eu as a sovereign nation they 'll need translators ( similar scenario to that of malta ) ... as if what you speak could be mistaken for `` english '' !, 
  scots and gaelic are recognized minority languages in scotland . 
  securing [ the status of the gaelic language as an official language ] ( http://www.gaidhlig.org.uk/bord/en/the-bord/about-bord-na-gaidhlig/gaelic-language-act/ ) [ of scotland ] [ has been worked on ... ] ( http://www.gaidhlig.org.uk/ ), 
  soon they might be able to talk about the foreign aggressor on europe 's / their borders !, 
   gbp is falling for almost 10 years how do you get [ that from this ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6m4pwis.png ) [ my own currency has a similar relationship . 
  i 'm looking forward to the uk leaving !, 
  it will be a fab show !, 
  i should buy a violin . 
  what if scotland joined the eu !, 
  you want a repeat of [ the previous case against microsoft ? 
  ] ( https://fsfe.org/activities/ms-vs-eu/timeline.en.html ) ( [ wiki summary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microsoft_corp_v_commission ) ) the final decision of the ec on the case no . 
  comp/c -3 / 37.792 against microsoft ( `` the 2004 decision '' ) found that : microsoft 's behaviour constitutes two separate abuses . 
  the first abuse is in `` the creation and sole exploitation of a its dominant position in the market of pc operating systems which disrupt previous levels of interoperability . '', 
   it 's so annoying because you can definitely tell that the voices are recorded in a booth and they 're never quite in synch ... ah , yes , i understand how you feel . 
  i see children 's television is now increasingly dubbed/localized . 
  disney & co. 
  it annoys me that children growing up today do n't get the same [ free ] language training/exposure i enjoyed . 
  i have fond memories of watching swedish , german , czech , finnish , british and american tv growing up . 
  i probably forgot some countries and shows , hehe . 
  sorry , that was a joke . 
  we do n't dub in my region . 
  we know you guys do it a lot , 
  it 's not mentioned terribly often . 
  we do n't like all the legislation coming out of `` brussels '' , but we care more about our own parliament and domestic issues . 
  what 's `` dubbing '' ? 
  ah , yes , i fully agree and understand . 
  i was n't sure they taught it in turkish schools . 
  i was under the impression they only covered in a footnote . 
  i believe there 's a big difference between the religious and state schools though . 
   worst day of my life !, 
  all is forgiven , dear brother !, 
  xd  we did n't colonize you guys just kidding , only the tip . 
  yes , that it is . 
  scary !, 
  i think i 'll stop imaging more horrible things about turkey 's future . 
  they might come true !, 
   i 'm guessing that it 's wrong , would you please link me sources which are actually legitimate in which case ? 
  ah , that map , i thought you might have seen that . 
  that 's % of exports , as opposed to % of gdp . 
  - [ here 's the employment stats by industry ] ( http://www.ssb.no/236678/employed-persons-by-main-activity.employees-and-self-employed.1-000-sy-209 )  norway 's primary industries are , as far as i know , the export of crude petroleum , oil , natural gas and fish yes , those are the biggest . 
  they dwarf the other industries in terms of value of the exports mentioned above . 
  the oil & gas employs relatively few people in proportion to the huge value of its exports . 
  the low oil price has mainly hurt the west coast region where many people worked in the industry . 
  we still have quite substantial forestry , metals and minerals , various tech/engineering , power , furniture and other industries . 
  it 's worth noting that most people in norway work in the service industries and the public sector is very big and stable ( state , counties , municipalities etc ) . 
  oh , right . 
  i suppose , but on the other hand if other nations claimed that `` the british are murderous criminals , they slaughtered the irish/french/scottish people in a terrible genocide ! '' ? 
  i suppose you would n't protest as loudly as the turks , but you would probably reject it in the most british way possible , 
   if it 's taught ` well ' , i.e. 
  including mentions of a ` controversial ' genocide label , arguments for that and counter-arguments debunking those , it will be really hard to move past that . 
  i 'm not sure if it was taught ? 
  you may know more about this than me , from recent domestic news , it 's not really on the agenda in norway , 
  would you want to though ? 
  the germans confront their past regularly and fully . 
  the same can not be said for all other nations that committed great crimes against their own or other peoples . 
  hmm , speaking of which , did n't you guys colonize norway ?!, 
  pay up !, 
  justice for norway !, 
  you gave us to sweden , you bastards !, 
  that might be another way of explaining it . 
  i heard that they obviously never killed that many ( 50 % ) when it was just an armed conflict ... 
  that there was a conflict at the time , that they were fighting the armenians . 
  the `` evil '' armenians , according to one person i heard on tv ( translated ) . 
  a legitimate conflict which excuses the [ disputed ] deaths ; which means it certainly was n't a genocide . 
  i read somewhere around here that one [ supposed ] turkish man claimed that he never knew the full truth until he left turkey . 
  yeah , but only if you ignore the fact that it 's children of all races etc. 
   most of norway 's industry is still based on the export of oil oil & gas represented 25 % of our gdp in 2014 . 
  i do n't think that 's an accurate representation of my country 's industries . 
  if anything `` export '' is not the correct word , it 's extraction and offshore systems ( engineering ) . 
   they 're paying their electric investments with oil . . no , just no . 
  the oil & gas revenue is invested abroad in a swf . 
  the national budget is mostly financed by income , capital and sales tax ( 75 % ) . 
  the first hydropower plants were created almost two centuries ago now (  1850 ) , i believe most were done by the 1950s . 
  we found oil in the late 1960s , and earned money in the 1990s . 
  the power companies are mostly owned by local municipalities and other private investors . 
  the consumers are paying for the maintenance/infrastructure these days by an additional meter tax . 
  ah , but they ca n't possibly believe their vehicles are better in any way ? 
  yeah , it fits , your leader seems to be destroying the turkish republic . 
  maybe he does n't like the people as it is ? 
  maybe he 'll reintroduce the arabic script and ottoman `` turkish '' next ? 
  why would it even matter now ? 
  do russian really consider it problematic ? 
  i mean many , if not most , jewish people do n't mind driving german cars today . 
  we should n't forget that their population believes a completely different story and justification for the `` conflict '' . 
  from their point of view it 's massively unfair and lies . 
  norwegian child protective services ( cps ) have a range of measures aimed at * helping * families and children . 
  they never start by taking away children , unless it 's an * emergency * where the children are at imminent risk of serious harm . 
  if the children are being starved , regularly beaten or in certain danger . 
  they usually start by offering ** help ** , such as carers in the home and training seminars . 
  sometimes it 's physically/mentally sick parents that are n't able to care for their children ( do n't provide enough food , cleanliness , education ) . 
  in other cases it 's a home with violence or drug abuse . 
  separating children is the measure of * last * resort . 
  couples that just lack the skills , experience or family , and do n't know how to take care of children benefit from the training seminars .
