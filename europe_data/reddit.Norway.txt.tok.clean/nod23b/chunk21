   they were , are , all fine , '' she says . 
  norwegian authorities are n't allowed to comment on cases in public . 
  so i guess we 'll never know ... but i know who i believe !, 
  where indeed !, 
  personally , i loved the sketches mocking germans [ \\ ( 1 \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi8shaosqzi ) [ \\ ( 2 \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvp_nrxfxyi ) and swedes [ \\ ( 1 \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmeaurvpt5q ) [ \\ ( 2 \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da4v5vkcgl8 ) the most . 
  yeah , i know it 's shitty finnish . 
  it 's still funny , 
  hehe , just a little norwegian humor .

   others might like rich uk citizens buying houses and spending money . 
  very few uk citizens move abroad to work permanently . 
  have you ever been to spain ? 
  okay , sounds like fun , but i never tried it here either . 
  i got 96 % on my first attempt . 
  i have too much free time ... 
  i did n't know you could drive a motorcycle at 17 !, 
   canada and us is too far to move in for me . 
  i get that , family and friends etc. 
   i like not-hot weather you could get that many places though . 
   personal space ( also means less traffic and less apartments yeah , see above . 
  rural canada ftw   freedom of speech . 
  now , that is a * good * reason to consider leaving turkey !, 
   wealth is not very important for me , i was n't really referring to personal wealth , rather the benefits of living in a * relatively * wealthier society in terms of stability , safety , infrastructure etc. 
   it 's not like that is n't a thing in other countries . 
  it 's just a bit different from what happens in larger countries with diverse populations . 
  you ca n't really compare it with the us or canada . 
   open xenophobia is rare pretty much anywhere in the western world , from what i know . 
  i think you just need a reminder . 
  from hungary 's govt to french political parties . 
  hey , you even have swedish/nordic neo-nazis parading . 
  admittedly it 's rarer to see those in public . 
  yeah , but either way , you 're just another [ future ] citizen . 
  that is n't the case in the scandinavian countries , where we 're basically still `` tribal '' nations . 
   the distinction between male and female has become really vague in most dialects . 
  just as in bokm\u00e5l , right ? 
  i 'm not sure if that 's the case , maybe i 'm not thinking clearly right now . 
  i really should go to bed  http://www.learnnorwegiannaturally.com/norwegian-grammar/how-to-inflect-norwegian-nouns/, 
   yeah and actually i think we should start fighting the influence from english if we want to let our language survive for the next century . 
  that fight is surely lost for both our cultures . 
  there 's little point fighting the inevitable , languages come and go anyway . 
   thanks to my knowledge of english , dutch and german , i have surprisingly little trouble reading norwegian . 
   the same goes for dutch in my eyes !, 
  though i had english , german , french and spanish in school , 
  reddit , always going in circles , 
   these fucking winters sucks . 
  do n't worry , we 'll soon be drowning in rain year round instead !, 
   i have n't seen any xenophobia in sweden . 
  no , of course not . 
  you 've only been a tourist ? 
  it 's not open xenophobia or hate crimes . 
  it 's the silent discrimination when applying for jobs , apartments etc. 
  oh , and arnstad sounds crazy . 
  sweden is very different from denmark and norway in this respect . 
   there are some countries which would be mostly the same which would be fine , but not that many . 
  my list includes canada , australia and the us . 
  which is probably even better for people who do n't look or think like us . 
  i 'm not saying they do n't belong here , it 's just harder to fit in here . 
   i would n't want to live in the us for example , because i do n't feel like they have a just society and there 's a lot of poverty around i would n't throw too many stones if i were you  you 're not wrong . 
  however , from a personal point of view that 's something i would likely avoid , if i moved there , simply because i have a good [ useful ] education , int ' l experience , skills and some capital . 
  life is ~ ~ good ~ ~ better in the us when you have a job and some money . 
   their healthcare system seems completely crazy well , it 's not that bad now with obamacare . 
  if you have a proper job and benefits it 's a very good system . 
  you 're too concerned with * everyone * getting a fair shake , hehe . 
  that 's very scandinavian   i really do think the country works fairly well , especially compared to others . 
  it works !, 
  it 's just not really well run , in my opinion . 
  all systems have their challenges , and our systems are weighed down by the masses . 
  if your aspirations are peace and stability , you can life a mediocre life in scandinavia just fine . 
  refugees fleeing wars and people from poorer countries see `` gold paved '' streets where i see a mundane , humdrum existence . 
   just nostalgiaish `` it was better back in the day '' feelings . 
  that 's probably always the case , hehe . 
   more garbage you just told us you went outside , you do n't have to repeat yourself . 
  jesus , you 're ignorant . 
  thankfully , there are more muslims in the us now than there will ever be in norway . 
  the political climate ? 
  that sounds like p.c. 
  code for xenophobia . 
  you 're not wrong though . 
  i just do n't see the appeal myself , * especially * for non-scandinavians . 
  if i were to emigrate it would be to the us , australia or canada . 
   years being a democracy ftfy : years claimed to be a democracy vs actually, 
  in my mind he is probably filled with ideas about a just , wealthy and modern society . 
  a case of `` greener '' grass . 
  it 's obviously a dream more than reality of course . 
  if he wants to be and feel properly integrated , find meaningful work , and become a citizen - i would rather go to canada or the us . 
   what 's the difference between liberal and conservative bokm\u00e5l . 
  we have many more alternative ways of spelling words within bokm\u00e5l today than just a few decades ago . 
  that is they 're * officially * accepted variations . 
  - they 're not used by people aspiring to use the sociolect of oslo 's best neighborhoods ( i.e. 
  akin to * riksm\u00e5l * ) . 
  it 's pretty unusual and odd to speak the way you write , especially if you write conservative bokm\u00e5l . 
  a clear cut example is `` the wife '' : - * konen * , is almost always * kona * when spoken a modern innovation and sign of the increasing liberalization is `` service '' : - * service * and * s\u00f8rvis * are both acceptable  i have ever heard about kaudervelsk that last part was just a joke , * kaudervelsk * is gibberish , as some people write the way their dialect sounds . 
  now , i do n't have a wild specimen available , but i have a classic example ; - a person from tr\u00f8ndelag could say ; '' \u00e6 e tr\u00f8nder \u00e6 '' . 
  - or '' \u00c5 , \u00e6 e i a \u00e6 \u00e5 ! '', 
  ( and i 'm also in [ class ] a ! ), 
  - or to quote something said in our version of `` the julekalender '' : `` hau , hau !, 
  it sort of makes more sense to adopt the country names .
