   the reason why we call it `` italien '' and `` venedig '' is thanks to ze germans yeah , i know , i just wanted to pick on my dear brothers   never stopped loaning words from germany , and throughout the protestant reformation high german words and sayings spread like a wildfire in sweden ) yeah , we did as well . 
  heck , we imported germans and literally adopted their [ mining ] laws , as is , in german ( s\u00e4chsische bergrecht , 1539 ) . 
  hey , just curious , i 've seen your nick around for some time , but i wonder if you still fancy going to sweden ? 
  if yes , why ? 
  what-m\u00e5l ? 
  that standard is dead for all intents and purposes . 
  at best we now have liberal bokm\u00e5l ( most common ) , conservative bokm\u00e5l ( rare ) , nynorsk and kaudervelsk . 
  you could be here in * spirit * alone !, 
   nynorsk was a failed nationalistic attempt except in , well bergen maybe ? 
  you could n't have chosen a worse example on the west coast . 
  although nynorsk has its stronghold in western norway and the areas surrounding bergen , most of the inhabitants of bergen itself write bokm\u00e5l . 
  now , failed is a pretty strong claim . 
  it 's a pretty widespread written norm , which is closer to many spoken dialects . 
  it 's important to note that it was a counter-reaction to centuries of colonialism and the dominance of a foreign language . 
  you dutchies should know how that feels , your language looks like a mix of german/english , french and spanish !, 
   where the hell `` syden '' is ? 
  hmm , i 'm not sure if it was originally just `` south of us '' . 
  i believe it 's commonly seen as southern europe . 
  beginning in southern france and includes most of spain and italy etc. 
  - in any case i believe it 's not a specific place , it 's the * situation * . 
  it 's where you find sun , sea and beaches . 
  now , that we increasingly travel to thailand and flordia on a regular basis , i believe they could be included . 
  however , that expression is rarely heard in my circles . 
  it seems like it belongs to my grand - / parents 's generation . 
   hellas does n't sound scandinavian at all , nah , but it 's more accurate . 
  i do n't know why or when we adopted it . 
   you have n't even committed fully that 's true , but we do have alternatives like `` hellener '' . 
  it 's a complicated place the ancient hellenistic world and post-ottoman greece . 
  by comparison with swedish at least we 're more `` loyal '' to the original names such our names for `` italia '' , `` milano '' , `` venezia '' , etc. 
  interestingly , if you look at many countries in asia , their names for far-away , unknown places are often based on the english name . 
  the chinese for norway sounds like `` nor-wei '' . 
  we seem to be going about it the other way . 
  you do n't know half of it , languages and dialects are deadly serious in norway !, 
  we have three official [ written ] languages you know !, 
  yes , as is proper  the greeks call the country hellas or ellada ( greek : \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 , \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 ; in polytonic : \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 , \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 ) and its official name is the hellenic republic . 
  we still call the people `` grekere '' , and their language `` gresk '' . 
  it 's hardly an important issue we discuss a lot , hehe . 
  it 's not surprising when you look at the etymology : - deutsch is derived from the indoeuropean root * \u00feeud\u014d , which roughly translates to `` people '' , as in nation . 
  - `` deutsch '' can be translated to `` the language , spoken by the ( common ) population '' , as opposed to latin . 
  all the others are languages of foreign nations . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://cornelia.siteware.ch/blog/wordpress/2005/11/27/the-meaning-of-deutsch ) ), 
  your point is very valid , but playing devil 's advocate , it 's also hard to argue against the english | foreign definition of spanish : - the [ iso 639-1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_iso_639-1_codes ) defines the code `` es '' for spanish ( espa\u00f1ol ) - the [ real academia espa\u00f1ola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_academia_espa%c3%b1ola ) literally regulates the spanish language . 
  - even the wiki page in spanish for the language reads : `` el idioma espa\u00f1ol o castellano '' . 
  imagine the disputes on that page !, 
  yet , it remains in that order ( e  c ) . 
  * '' does make it a pretty obvious candidate for `` spanish '' in foreigner 's eyes . 
  you 've left ? 
  i hope you 're eating better now !, 
   finished your studies there , i guess , what 's next ? 
  nope . 
  we say `` nederland '' and `` nederlandsk '' . 
  holland is acceptable , but it 's usually nederland . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/testsidan/id2356306/ ), 
  odd , it 's called '' * nederlandsk * '' in norwegian . 
  we call the country `` nederland '' . 
  i 'm going to guess that you drank more water/beer/wine / soda than aquavit though ? 
  with few exceptions that stuff is * only * used for christmas in norway . 
  at least in my part of the country . 
  even if you are a troll , it 's fairly typical of ignorant americans , always taking more credit than is their due . 
  every community has planned for weeks in advance . 
  public streets have been spring cleaned , flowers have been planted , banners hung . 
  local neighborhoods have cleaned and prepared themselves . 
  first of all we celebrate by parading in the streets of * every * village , town and city . 
  we wear our finest clothes and our national costume . 
  our children march and sing , bands play music . 
  every school and class marches in order . 
  we do this in almost every country where there are norwegians present . 
  after the marching we have festivities at our schools ( food , games etc ) . 
  after this people usually gather at home for more food and socializing into the evening . 
  it 's a family event , so alcohol is consumed in moderate amounts . 
  the youth have parties the night before . 
   edit : another quite interesting thing to note is norway made their constitution in 1814 while denmark first got it in 1849 ... 
  i wonder why norway got it so early ( or denmark so late ) . 
  if anyone knows , feel free to enlighten me . 
  it 's important to note that the danish king feared the liberal politics of independent norway . 
  the norwegian constitution put the power in the hands of the people . 
  it 's important to note that the danish king feared the liberal politics of independent norway . 
  the constitution clearly put power in the hands of the people . 
  the original was . 
  our current constitution has been updated many times since . 
  the prior to last update and current was written using 1910-1920 norwegian . 
  it does look danish to modern eyes . 
  we get to * pay * , but not vote !, 
  norway is a member of esa and cern . 
  these organizations predate the eu . 
  - treaty of rome ( 1957 ) - cern ( 1954 ), 
   the big ones in norway are : ~ ~ dagrofa ~ ~ ( meny and kiwi ) you have this mixed up . 
  kiwi is norwegian . 
  [ norgesgruppen bought ~ 50 % of dagrofa ] ( http://www.dagrofa.dk/da-dk/om-dagrofa/dagrofa-i-dag.aspx ) . 
  - kiwi in norway is run by norgesgruppen . 
  - kiwi in denmark is run by dagrofa ( i.e. 
  nope , you eu guys have fished your seas empty . 
  we 've taken care of our stocks and do n't want to share . 
  we have * stricter * regulation , for example with regards to bycatch . 
  our [ calculated ] gdp has been higher than the neighbors for the last three-four centuries , according to a map shown here some time ago . 
  it was based on historical data . 
  we used to supply the uk with the forestry products needed for their fleets . 
  while we also sold lots of dried fish all over europe . 
  on top of that came our minerals ( mining ) and industrial capacity such as glass and rare-ish minerals ( cobalt ) . 
  i hear it 's similar to scotland .
