  my middle name is literally bear , 
  we have all winter for that , spring/summer is about being awake . 
  in that case i approve !, 
  does the eu add anything to this map ? 
  haha , two-for-one !, 
  yeah , we do that in norway as well ... heck , the swedes import some of our garbage because of the competition . 
  italians are well known for being a bit perverted , you just want to buy/sleep with the waiter 's entire family , right ? 
  or `` you want to eat my family '' ? 
  shhh , do n't wake putin !, 
   except for the netherlands everyone pretty much fucked it up no , the scandinavian name is close to the original spelling and root . 
  the spelling in german was n't fixed/set for a long time , and the alternative form disappeared . 
  - you could spell it either * deutsch * or * teutsch * . 
  ( [ images ] ( http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb11067885_00005.html ) ) secondly , tysk/teutsch/deutsch all have the same meaning and historical root : - old norse \u00fe\u00fd\u00f0verskr , \u00fe\u00fdzkr , which came from : - proto-germanic * \u00feiudiskaz ( `` of or relating to a people '' ) , - proto-germanic * \u00feeud\u014d ( `` people , nation '' ) , - from proto-indo-european * tewt\u00e9h \u2082 ( `` people '' ) . 
  the \u00fe ( thorn ) character is pronounced similar to th as in the english word `` thick '' ( or similar to th as in the english word `` the '' ) . 
  tyskland = land of the people . 
  scandinavians usually use the same names for foreign countries , danish and norwegian in particular . 
  the only name norwegian do n't share with danish and swedish is greece . 
  we call it hellas in norwegian , because that 's the actual name . 
  in norwegian we also prefer to spell country names with - a endings where appropriate rather than - en ; so slovenia is `` slovenia '' in norwegian , while in swedish it 's `` slovenien '' . 
  well , no , the green area is correct ? 
  yes , and they all speak a strange version of a germanic language that their neighbors can barely understand , 
  [ thredbo ( ski resort ) is well known . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk3punq3xy0 ), 
  yes , there 's a lot more behind the scenes . 
  we 're nato 's frontline in the arctic . 
  historically , that has meant a lot of spying and watching each other by any means possible . 
  especially , from the air , sea and electronically . 
  - there 's been a large [ military radar installation in northern norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/globus_ii ) since the cold war days . 
  it was built by the americans , but manned by us . 
  it has recently been upgraded . 
  - there 's a reason the cia 's u2 spy planes landed in bod\u00f8 , norway . 
  you may have read about [ that incident in the 1960s ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_u-2_incident ) - we used to have just one naval spy vessel , now we have upped it to two . 
  [ we 've just received our brand new ship . 
  ] ( https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2016/05/new-intelligence-vessel-barents-sea-makes-port-call-kirkenes ) - we just bought new p-8 maritime patrol planes to replace existing aircraft and improve our surveillance capacity , and [ we 're going to be cooperating closely with the uk . 
  ] ( https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/britain-norway-agree-cooperation-maritime-patrol-aircraft/ ) it 's increasingly more important to the nato alliance : - there 's a large cache of `` pre-stored '' american military equipment and vehicles in norway in order to rapidly deploy ( `` just add soldiers '' ) . 
  - we 've just agreed to host 300 us marines in norway . 
  it 's a radical shift in policy since we never permitted foreign troops during the cold war . 
  - the bi-annual nato exercises in northern norway , [ `` cold response '' ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/sixteen-nations-participating-in-norway-s-cold-response-military-exercise-this-week ) , is no coincident . 
  - [ the uk and us do regular winter warfare training in this region ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l7dtvskhlu ) , which will come in handy should an invasion occur . 
  we have plenty of cooperation with the russians in modern times , until the recent crimea business . 
  in fact we opened our borders !, 
  - citizens of the border regions in both countries are free to visit without a visa . 
  it 's just that our swedish friend was comparing religious extremists with people who left looking for new homes and/or riches . 
   the word practically means ? 
  it seems you do n't !, 
  it 's miles from what isis is !, 
   isis is exactly that , conquerors , robbers and settlers they 're extremists and religious freaks !, 
  isis wants to conquer the world for religious/ideological reasons !, 
  the vikings looked for new homes and riches . 
  bad point , bad comparison . 
  we settled lands and lived next to the natives . 
  we did n't kill out of hatred . 
  brutality was not a goal !, 
  eh , no , they were conquerors , robbers and * settlers * . 
  they * did n't * kill off everyone they encountered out of hatred !, 
  do you even know our history ? 
  see the danelaw , normandy , etc. 
  there was no religious or racist hatred on their minds . 
  comparing them with the retarded , murderous animals of isis is a ** deep ** insult !, 
   we learnt that that being passive encourages mass murder rather than vice versa . 
  we 're hardly `` passive '' though . 
  wwii ended because of our sacrifices . 
  today , we actively intervene , especially when it comes to human rights issues . 
  the larger european nations in particular , i.e. 
  britain and france . 
  even my country has soldiers in syria/iraq and afghanistan , and our jets bombed libya , serbia , etc. 
  we 're quite aware of our responsibility . 
  yes , that may seem like a good point , but in fact it 's not . 
  in the unlikely event that the russians choose to invade we 'll face them from the air , sea and land . 
  we have plenty of the first two to defend . 
  the land border is just a gateway . 
  if they choose , they may simply go around the border by invading [ non-nato ] sweden . 
  we obviously do n't want a maginot line failure !, 
  as for norway 's border ( s ) with russia it 's actually much more complicated , russia wants to own the arctic . 
  they 've been keen on our outer territory since the ussr 's days . 
  - [ map of norwegian territory and waters bordering russia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydy4yht.png ) - [ map of norwegian oil and gas resources ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bl6w8od.gif ) finally , if russia chose to invade at all costs they could easily win . 
  they have overwhelming manpower and firepower . 
  [ what with their 2750 tanks , 1500 combat aircraft ( infographic ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1dmtbsu.jpg ) and an army the size of our biggest city !, 
  under putin [ the arctic has become a priority ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-arctic-insight-iduskbn15e0w0 ) and [ they 've built a number of new bases there ( map ) . 
  ] ( http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55c50ab3371d22c6178bca77-1200-1062/bi_graphics_russia%27s%20militarization%20of%20the%20arctic_05.png ) the major naval base in [ severomorsk ( map ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b0fahpi.jpg ) , home of [ the northern fleet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_fleet ) , is right next door . 
  the northern fleet includes about two-thirds of all the russian navy 's nuclear-powered ships including the flagship battlecruiser [ pyotr velikiy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_battlecruiser_pyotr_velikiy ) and the only russian aircraft carrier , [ the admiral kuznetsov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_aircraft_carrier_admiral_kuznetsov ) . 
  both of which were deployed in the med in support of syria . 
  that 's hardly accurate . 
  you 're militarized * today * because you have hostile neighbors that have repeatedly attacked you . 
  on the other hand there 's a reason for that . 
  that history in itself begins prior to 1948 . 
  europe did n't kick out the arabs from mandatory palestine or force you to settle there . 
  eretz israel was yours once , but europe did n't take it from you . 
  also , herzl and the zionists started their work long before wwii . 
  europe made `` contributions '' to the formation , but it 's hardly a direct line to today . 
  now , it may have been the best solution , but present day israeli policies are your own . 
  i have ashkenazi background , so i 'm not exactly indifferent . 
  i 've also visited israel . 
  you guys have a different mentality and world view , but then again you 're at war . 
   the norwegians have nothing to protect except their fishing waters we have good neighbors . 
  our land border with russia is our most guarded . 
  we * respect * russia 's potential for aggression despite never having been at war with them . 
   it 's still a bit weird historically speaking that the jewish state is more capable militarily than most european nations . 
  you think it 's `` weird '' that the holocaust and cold war gave us a distaste for war ?
