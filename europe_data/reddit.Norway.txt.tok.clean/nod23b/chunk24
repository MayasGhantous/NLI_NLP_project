  at least * we * get along with our neighbors !, 
  no , no , it was my fault , it was very open to interpretation . 
  yours was the natural assumption , 
  perhaps it was n't clear , but by `` both languages '' , i meant in swedish and norwegian , 
  nah , we have it all invested around the world ; 1,25 % of the world 's shares , and in real estate . 
  in fact we own some really nice parts of london such as regent street [ with the crown estate ] , 
   but wo n't use it because reasons we do n't because the eu can literally tear up the whole agreement or just the section we disagree to accept . 
  it 's risky business for us . 
   so why is your population against joining the eu ? 
  because they see no value in joining and giving up control ? 
  it 's a big entity and we 're a small nation . 
  the usual arguments apply ; lack of democracy , big and wasteful , bureaucracy , lack of power , etc. 
  they do have a fair point . 
  for example laws that work well in germany or spain might not work well here due to scale or climate . 
  we have lots of resources and a pretty well run state . 
  it works well because of our size - and especially the trust that exists between our people and our leaders . 
  a future eu might not leave us with much freedom locally , ruled from abroad . 
  hehe , sounds good :d, 
  ah , is that the motivation ? 
  i thought it was part of a grand scheme . 
  well , we call it `` eu light '' , as we incorporate eu legislation , accept all of the four freedoms , take part in the inner market and schengen . 
  finally , we pay for it , but we do n't have a vote !, 
  do n't worry marine will make it yours !, 
  that sounds like it should be changed soon ? 
  people abroad do n't know how useful * fika * is for businesses . 
  haha !, 
  ok , if you say so , i do n't know the details myself , 
  the question of whether or not our constitution allows it has been discussed . 
  having only just regained our sovereignty , after some 4-500 years of various unions , means we 're still quite happy to be on our own . 
  on the other hand we have to accept eu legislation without a vote , so there 's little point in claiming we 're fully independent as it is . 
  there are those who would prefer a hard `` brexit '' for norway also , or a new , better deal with the eu . 
  i agree , 
   `` i tiden '' refers to being current , up to date . 
  that part was clear , in both languages , it just seems superfluous . 
  a bit too much like a corporate slogan . 
  yes , from what i understand it 's to make the separation between romania and moldova clearer . 
  russian financed , some say . 
  because it 's not theirs , it 's the royal family 's . 
  i wonder if there 's something that 's not translatable ? 
  swedish is quite easy to understand , but the '' * i tiden * '' seems a little bit unnecessary ? 
  why the emphasis on time ? 
  is there a history ? 
  that came from those islands , then germany , denmark , scandinavia , france , etc. 
  alternatively , `` all for norway '' ( * alt for norge * ) . 
  `` alle '' = everyone , `` alt '' = everything . 
  at the time it was `` enige og tro indtil dovre falder '' , which i think looks nicer . 
  i read somewhere that they 're now calling it `` moldovan '' for political reasons ? 
  `` in december 2013 , the constitutional court of moldova ruled that the declaration of independence takes precedence over the constitution , and that the state language should be called romanian . '', 
  `` as of march 2017 , the presidential site under igor dodon has seen the romanian language option changed to `` moldovan '' , which is described to be `` in accordance with the constitution '' by said president '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldovan_language, 
  i think you mean the european broadcasting union . 
  it 's not a company , it 's a union of broadcasting organisations . 
  membership is open , fees apply . 
  [ a great number of countries take part . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/ebu_member_elliptic.svg/1000px-ebu_member_elliptic.svg.png ), 
  ok , i do n't know about that , mine 's still right . 
  you voted to leave * and * you use the flag of europe as your flair ? 
  yes , but an unfortunate choice of words in this context . 
  he really should have chosen his words more carefully . 
  you 're funny . 
  i do n't know where you 're getting that from ? 
  we definitely love you in scandinavia !, 
  we love your culture , film , television , humor , literature , music , sports , history , people , landscapes , towns and cities . 
  we love to visit and even study there !, 
  from what i gather so do the germans . 
  i would n't be surprised if most europeans would say they like you . 
  yes , that 's fair , but the comment section is all yours !, 
   i really wonder what anti-uk `` shit talk '' he 's talking about ? 
  this does n't include \u00c6\u00d8\u00c5 though , which are not accents or umlauts . 
  yes , not the full deal , we did join the eea and schengen though . 
  as you may know , we have our own `` mini-eu '' for efta . 
  we basically have copies of the eu court and surveillance authority , that we run according to their rules and use to monitor ourselves . 
   we forced norway into a personal union under the swedish king , nah , long * before * 1814 sweden invaded and took various pieces of norway that you either kept ( [ bohusl\u00e4n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohusl%c3%a4n ) , [ j\u00e4mtland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4mtland ) , [ h\u00e4rjedalen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a4rjedalen ) ) or returned ( [ tr\u00f8ndelag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_roskilde ) ) the [ swedification of j\u00e4mtland ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4mtlands_historia#f.c3.b6rsvenskningen_av_j.c3.a4mtland ) was brutal from what i 've read . 
   i 'm all for nordic banter , it 's fun and all . 
  but do n't spread complete bullshit lies . 
  yeah , it 's mostly banter , i did say of sorts . 
  finland was more of a colony , in my eyes , you even settled the country . 
  we know him well here !, 
  after all , [ he was shot when he tried invading us . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_fredriksten ), 
   the uk is a part of the eu in fact . 
  yeah , but we have n't decided to leave   we do n't know where it 'll end up . 
  brexit means [ hard ] brexit , if you ask me . 
  hehe , well , if you feel that 's an accurate representation !, 
   ( kidding ), 
  what `` eu '' ? 
  nice one !, 
  the russians lost most , the british did more than the americans [ in europe ] . 
  yet all deserve credit for their sacrifices . 
   i doubt the average person in latvia or slovakia cares ironically , you would be wrong , it 's citizens from countries around that part of europe that cares the most [ since their expats work in your country ] . 
   despite talking shit about it 24/7 the only `` shit talk '' i 've noted over the last decade has been british ? 
  the anti-eu rhetoric has been quite prominent in your so-called `` newspapers '' . 
   we like your football , does it count ? 
  owned by foreign billionaires , using players from anywhere , with fans everywhere . 
  it 's almost as european and global as it can get . 
   both culturally and geographically that 's overdoing it , they 're culturally dissimilar in many if not most respects ; politically , socially , economically . 
  as for geographically , [ france * still * holds islands in north america ] ( http://www.emapsworld.com/images/saint-pierre-and-miquelon-location-map-in-north-america.gif ) , it 's actually much closer !, 
  we 're actually part of the inner market * and * schengen . 
  you can put us back on the map , you bastards !, 
  hey , at least we 're part of the inner market and schengen !, 
  you do n't know finland and sweden 's history .
