  russia , china , and others also take part in such missions around the world where it suits them . 
  the same goes for saudia arabia and the uae , they are really gearing up ; purchasing/upgrading and funding homegrown weapons industries . 
  they 're ready to use that force abroad , from libya ( uea in particular ) to [ the saudi led intervention in yemen . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saudi_arabian-led_intervention_in_yemen ) the uae is one of the few countries to have [ military bases abroad ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-eyes-military-expansion-eastern-africa-2028510672 ) now ( see [ djibouti ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33115502 ) ) . 
  hehe  joking aside , is n't that exactly what 's happening ? 
  vienna especially . 
   still american soldiers never had the stigma of being respsonible for local crime laid upon them like it was ( rightfully ) in japan . 
  oh , i 'm not saying they 're worse than the locals , just that they add to the numbers . 
  they 're a great number of young men [ and women ] . 
  from my experience with military bases in my country , young men from the bases will have an effect on local crime and accidents . 
  it 's usually drunken violence and accidents , but it 's very real . 
   the term is `` freeloading . '', 
  you 're not wrong , but it 's also a question of scope . 
  i believe you call it mission creep ? 
  if nato is supposed to defend europe , why are we fighting in afghanistan , libya , syria , etc ? 
  they 're not included in the treaty 's scope . 
   the us has been spending billions on it 's military while european nations have been enjoying the benefits of spending billions on welfare and social benefits that improve their nations instead you 're a simpleton for believing that , that so-called argument has been around for decades . 
  european nations have spent on defense all of the time , just not at levels the us wants . 
  we have very different needs and goals . 
  the us spends on its military to maintain its influence , to reach * its * goals , which is quite different from `` protecting '' anyone else !, 
  the us has an interest in keeping europe free , we represent a great deal of their corporate profits !, 
  our economies are interconnected . 
  they would even speak * actual * german in austria !, 
  i imagine the environmental damage and clean-up would be quite expensive . 
  a good tenant has to clean up after himself , that much the ground 's owner can demand . 
   germany pays the us for those bases because it is cheaper than building their own military they do have their own military , and the us bases are used for `` force projection '' far beyond europe . 
  take [ ramstein air base ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-most-important-us-air-force-base-youve-never-heard-of-the-ramstein-air-base-in-germany/5536033 ) for example , the headquarters for the united states air forces in europe - air forces africa . 
  it is used to transport soldiers back and forth from theaters such as iraq and afghanistan ( see also landstuhl regional medical center ) . 
  in addition to being a us [ command center for drone missions ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/ramstein-base-in-germany-a-key-center-in-us-drone-war-a-1029279.html ) in areas like pakistan , yemen , iraq , syria , afghanistan and somalia . 
  the money spent by us troops and the bases will naturally have a positive economic impact on nearby businesses . 
  food , entertainment , maintenance services , etc. 
  on the other hand you 'll also see negative consequences in the form of traffic , accidents/traffic deaths , environmental damage , and probably some more crime and violence ( young men ) . 
  hehe , i do n't know . 
  i do remember seeing the same photo and the video here . 
  ah , yes , i did look up the song , 
  thanks !, 
  i needed more bucket songs !, 
  hmm , i do n't see why not ? 
  [ i have the perfect song for that !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/loy7quyojam?t=102 ), 
   really hope the eu does n't purposefully damage its own citizens prosperity to try and damage the uk as a punishment for leaving . 
  they have to , to keep everyone else in line . 
  i understood danish-tv2 's `` dutch '' much easier than her `` danish '' . 
  we already did this in norway , the results were bad . 
  the governing party is re-considering . 
  it did n't have the desired effect ( green ) , but it did cost jobs . 
   the people i know that works in the military yes , but they 're not the top brass , are they ? 
  the strategic choices clearly have negative consequences for the employees , but they 're not the main concern for a national defense . 
  are they complaining about their jobs or our strategy ? 
  or maybe it 's both ? 
  i agree that there are clearly negative aspects and consequences , but i have to trust that the leadership is looking at the bigger picture . 
   the generals are hanging out in the south sorry , that 's just silly . 
  if we 're ever invaded i doubt they 'll stop outside oslo . 
   leaves the army in the north without helicopter support . 
  i 'm not sure having them in the north would help us much . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong , on the contrary , but the support aspect seems secondary . 
  it 's not as if we could realistically hold them off , never mind the new technologies and strategies ( see ukraine ) . 
  if the russians attacked they could hammer us from the air and sea far too quickly . 
  having the helicopters in the rear [ and undamaged ] could possibly be a wise move ? 
  at least we would be able to move troops and equipment where we need it . 
  i did n't clarify which you were , i thought of you as primarily a settlement in this context . 
  however , `` around 1000 '' is pretty vague , by 1200 iceland was under norwegian rule . 
  denmark only kept iceland , greenland and the faroes because they were norwegian * biland * ( in 1814 ) . 
  here 's a [ proper set of norwegian costumes . 
   m109 offered by ruag . 
  yes , ruag and the former ~ ~ samsung ~ ~ , hanwha techwin , are the primary contenders . 
  the germans and french are n't out , they 're just on hold , according to the article . 
  i havent ' followed this , it might have been resolved already . 
  did n't you notice the ~ ~ strikethrough ~ ~ ? 
  we canceled the purchase . 
  i seriously doubt we 'll buy anything that 's not german or american :d you 're right in assuming that [ we might though . 
  ] ( https://www.tu.no/artikler/haeren-ligger-an-til-a-fa-koreanske-kanoner/350619 ), 
   if it 's a short term place like german posters are pointing out then it 's really not a big deal either way . 
  hmm , i would literally go hungry than eat that stuff . 
  i do n't know how they can claim it 's norwegian beef . 
  i would eat gruel . 
   colonized by norwegians at least it was gentler than the swedification that followed !, 
  hehe , yeah , i think i knew you were from around that part , allan . 
  i was going to mention that it would look `` unusual '' on the map for most swedes and norwegians alike . 
  yes , but i 'm sure the top brass knows what they want . 
  it 's not just politics without input , it 's guided by the military 's own wishes . 
  we still have to prioritize , but at least we 'll get a capable force eventually . 
  the military 's own reports are very detailed and interesting reads . 
  yep , it 's interesting to see how the map makers casually dismiss entire parts of europe like that . 
  ironically , you 're more `` european '' than us at the moment . 
  yes , but we 're changing that now . 
  hopefully , it will work as planned . 
  we 're also crewing up to actually make use of them though . 
  yes , or at least someone in the family , 
  norway bought [ f-35 jets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_f-35_lightning_ii ) and a lot of other equipment after 2015 ( first deliveries in 2016 ) . 
  this year we 've bought new surveillance aircraft ( [ p8 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-norway-agree-new-cooperation-on-maritime-patrol-aircraft ) ) , new submarines ( [ germany ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/articles/norway-joins-forces-with-germany-to-procure-new-submarines ) ) , and will buy new artillery ( ~ ~ [ archer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archer_artillery_system ) ~ ~ ) , etc. 
  new intelligence gathering vessels ( [ marjata ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/fs_%c2%abmarjata%c2%bb_\\ ( 2016 \\ ) ) ) , and combat vehicles ( [ cv90 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combat_vehicle_90 ) ) have been delivered ( to complement the [ leopard 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard_2 ) main battle tank ) . 
  the [ hk416 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_hk416 ) / 417 is now the standard rifle . 
  this map does n't show the norwegian colonies and territories in the far north ; iceland , greenland , faroes . 
  we only see norse britain and ireland . 
  thanks , they were quite good while the show ran . 
  here 's a list showing their range : - [ \u00c6\u00d8\u00c5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488ujaqgmw&amp;list=plmgapjz35aztlrwbahbk71v1qulagka6m ) - [ when am i supposed to blossom ( heinrich ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqvq6buwa8e ) - [ gay chicken ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ima-vjwwk_4 ) - [ i wan na be the little spoon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqmghrsrecm ) - [ kygo 's confession ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mszwc0kfz8g ) - [ just standing here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixmskpjwuy0 ) - [ why are you wearing a hat ( in norwegian ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2i_onud7ia ) - [ swedish party poopers ( in norwegian ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmeaurvpt5q ) - [ german film parody `` ohne zahnzeide '' ( in german ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvp_nrxfxyi ) - [ origins of dubstep ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p_rria_alc ) - [ lemaitre parody ( in norwegian ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj3nanrrfaa ), 
  at least they 're trying to create [ a hit song !,

  as a german i wonder if you enjoyed [ this sketch ?
