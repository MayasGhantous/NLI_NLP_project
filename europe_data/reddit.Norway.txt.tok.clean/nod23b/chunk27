   northerners have a mystic relation to the forest , and the leisure activity of taking a walk in the forest is not shared by many people in the south . 
  yes , indeed !, 
  [ nature is my church .

   americans saved europe in wwi & wwii the russians and british did most of that work in europe , thanks . 
  the americans joined the party later . 
   if the us had done this to western europe you 'd all have a fit . 
  the electronic application is tantamount to a visa . 
   because of the tribes the other nations came in contact with not all though . 
  in the scandinavian languages we call it * tyskland * , which means the same as deutschland ( land of the people ) . 
  that 's strange , because everyone i know says `` nederland '' . 
   denmark = tanska yeah , tallinn ( dane castle ) makes a lot of sense . 
   i 've heard of basically nothing going to paris or frankfurt , let alone anywhere else . 
  in that case you have n't been listening very carefully  - [ hsbc ] ( http://fortune.com/2017/01/18/hsbc-brexit-london-paris-uk/ ) ( paris ) - [ ubs and goldman sachs ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-davos-meeting-hsbc-idukkbn1520so ) ( frankfurt ) - [ deutsche bank ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-latest-banks-leave-uk-eu-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-citi-group-deutsche-bank-a7193686.html ) ( frankfurt ) - [ goldman sachs ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/davos-big-banks-future-post-brexit-banking-jobs-move-eu-financial-sector-goldman-sachs-hsbc-wef-a7536836.html ) is considering moving half of its london-based jobs to frankfurt and other financial centres . 
  - [ morgan stanley ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/10/goldman-sachs-jpmorgan-morgan-stanley-mull-london-exodus.html ) ( new york , possibly continental cities ) morgan stanley , jpmorgan , boa and citigroup indicated they would also shift people abroad . 
  barclays and hsbc european operations will be dublin based . 
  yes , global , but not eu . 
  yeah , that 's quite a lot . 
  it 's been a very light here this year ( at least in my part ) . 
  [ a water canteen ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/img1.tinydeal.com/images/62/07/46207_332354_hui-46207.jpg ) of some sort , i suppose ? 
  possibly , a rifle butt . 
   noisy , crowded , dirty . 
  have you ever been to one ? 
  that joke does n't really fit with finland , they do n't even have access to the arctic sea ( or polar bears ) . 
   a whole bunch of finno ugric languages that are spoken in scandinavia eh , you mean the sami languages ? 
  a group of ** uralic ** languages . 
  finland is n't in scandinavia . 
  migration from the east . 
  the [ finns from eastern russia ] ( http://www.worldology.com/europe/images/ancient_europe_finnic.jpg ) possibly and [ the magyar from the steppes ] ( http://www.eliznik.org.uk/easteurope/history/migration-map/hungarian-emap.gif ) . 
  the estonians however seem to have adopted it from the finns . 
  at least that 's one theory . 
   to me that seems like a real shame . 
  hear , hear . 
   because bokmal is a remnant from the filthy danes that 's was the original idea . 
   the prefered language these days all norwegians speak a dialect . 
  most dialects will be closer to one of the written standards , but they 're often quite different ( vocabularies ) . 
  most norwegians speak something closer to bokm\u00e5l than nynorsk . 
  the central capital district * write * bokm\u00e5l while many more distant regions write nynorsk ( not all ) . 
  the municipalities decide which written standard they prefer . 
  ah , how interesting . 
  this reminds me of school , when the teacher played audio samples of all the dialects , at the time it was n't that interesting !, 
   is much more aligned with danish when written . 
  yes , for the most part , but when you can write sentences containing - a forms and words like * s\u00f8rvis * ( service ) it certainly requires a lot more flexibility on part of the dane reading it !, 
  ;-) hehe , written and spoken ? 
   the latest writing reform of bokm\u00e5l , made official in 2005 , moved bokm\u00e5l back to its roots in riksm\u00e5l , in such a way that the two language forms are more or less the same . 
  that 's an interesting claim . 
  i do n't see how that could possibly be true , with the alternatives that have been introduced . 
  now , if we leave that , i think standard \u00d8stnorsk and [ liberal ] bokm\u00e5l , which is the most commonly used form , is quite far from danish . 
  i think you 're missing my point . 
  bokm\u00e5l certainly came from riksm\u00e5l / dano-norwegian , but it 's changed so rapidly the last few decades that it 's no longer a good description . 
  the liberal forms and alternatives ( * sideformer * ) has changed it quite a bit . 
  standard \u00d8stnorsk is quite far off from the conservative form of bokm\u00e5l used in the previous century . 
  the offshoot ( [ samnorsk ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/samnorsk ) ) that tried to merge both major standards seems to have won quite bit of ground ( battles , not war ) . 
  it seems almost misleading to outsiders and danes to still describe * bokm\u00e5l * as danish today . 
  it 's just my opinion . 
   also , what is with the germany tendency to say `` how it 's called '' instead of `` what it 's called '' ? 
  i assume it comes from something in the german language as no one else seems to do it . 
  yes , they use `` how '' ( wie ) to ask what it 's called . 
  '' * '' in german * wie * means how , and * was * means what . 
  but the confusion arises from the fact that the same idea is rendered differently in english than in german . 
  in english , we say , `` what is your name ? '' . 
  the literal german translation is `` was ist dein name ? '' . 
  but in german , we say , `` wie hei\u00dfen sie ? '', 
  ( respectively , formal and informal ) . 
  and the literal english translation is `` how are you called ? '', 
  other expressions also have different renderings . 
  `` ich habe hunger '' literally translates into `` i have hunger '' , but the english equivalent is `` i am hungry '' . 
  [ \\ ( source \\ ) ] ( http://german.stackexchange.com/questions/4290/what-is-the-difference-between-wie-and-was-in-a-certain-context ), 
  danes seem to understand bergensk easier . 
  i 've worked with plenty of danes at home and in denmark . 
   bok = bokm\u00e5l ( `` book language '' ) - danish based norwegian written form i feel that 's a bit outdated , it has long since become something akin to * samm\u00e5l * what with all the variations of liberal bokm\u00e5l . 
  bah , i had icelanders on my sports team , you were n't that difficult to understand over time . 
  your written texts are easy enough . 
  i work with swedes from all over sweden , it 's mostly individual differences . 
  they seem to think they do n't understand dialect x over y. 
  some think western norwegian is easier , while others prefer eastern . 
  there 's no logic or rules :d, 
   the swedish vikings that come ireland long ago . 
  those were [ norwegian vikings . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w42557d.png ) [ dublin and other places in ireland ] ( https://i1.wp.com/thedockyards.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/viking-map.jpg ) were mostly norwegian settlements or trade posts . 
  the swedes mostly went eastwards and ruled russia . 
   the same patterns and behaviours americans have , we have too . 
  fortunately , the reports i 've read show that it 's not the case . 
  from education to media , we 're on different tracks . 
  the us struggles with great inner city poverty , poor minorities , bad public education , expensive higher education . 
  europe is n't all good , there are good and bad places , but it 's certainly better in most respects due to welfare states and income equality . 
  that 's because you 're a stupid swede !, 
  :p / joking now , joking aside , norway is part of the eu 's inner market ( eu/eea ) . 
  that 's most important part of the eu from my point of view and especially when talking about china . 
  we 're part of the ** most ** european project for unity : - the council of europe ( [ the current leader is norwegian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_general_of_the_council_of_europe ) ) we 're also part of : - nato , whose [ current leader is norwegian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_general_of_nato ) , * unlike * `` neutral '' sweden and finland - the schengen area - [ the eu 's nordic battle group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battlegroup ) , with sweden and finland - efta ( with iceland , switzerland , etc ) - the oecd - and many other european initiatives such as esa do n't be so quick to dismiss us because we 're not full members of the eu . 
  you swedes rarely know anything about norway beyond the word `` oil '' . 
   china 's only interest in us is as a market imho . 
  which is perfectly fine , that 's a powerful position to be in . 
   why should we serve anyone ? 
  serve ? 
  i do n't see where you got that . 
  we do what is in our interest , sometimes that includes giving , taking , helping , etc. 
   we should safeguard our interests , not china or the us . 
  that 's exactly what i said above .
