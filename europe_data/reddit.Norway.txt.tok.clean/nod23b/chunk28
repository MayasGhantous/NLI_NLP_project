  how we do that will involve the us and china . 
  yes , possibly . 
  the current european disunity is to our disadvantage . 
   4/10 americans seem to have not read a book in the past year , this number is probably similar in the rest of the western world the americans have very different media patterns by comparison with europe . 
  we still read newspapers and books . 
  thanks for that link , i spent some time [ virtually ] walking around the city . 
  it was interesting to see . 
  i 've only been to turkey a few times , but this reminded me of israel and spain . 
  it was really nice looking from the hillside and surrounding country side . 
  portugal is great !, 
  i was really impressed by what i met there on my first visit . 
  i knew the older generation was not very proficient , based on business connections my family had . 
  everyone i met in lisboa , from the taxi driver to random people on the street , spoke it well . 
  the local mini-market owner did n't , but he was an old man . 
  nothing a few words in spanish and hand signs could n't solve !, 
  the new silk road will probably be more important anyway . 
  it also makes it easier to `` split '' europe from the us , which may be useful for china , but is it in our best interest ? 
  i do n't believe we can trust the americans or the chinese to safeguard our interests . 
  ah , of course , we probably got it from german . 
  from what i understand it 's not usual to have more than one , but i 'm uncertain about that . 
  i know some have more than one . 
  they 're most common in denmark . 
  here 's [ a list and photos of all of them \\ ( from denmark \\ ) . 
   the church in the foreground is very unusual since it is filled with amazing model ships that 's a votive ship , sometimes called a church ship . 
  votive ships are relatively common in churches in the scandinavian countries denmark , norway and sweden . 
  the village in question is historically danish . 
  - here 's an example from [ a norwegian church ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/kirkeskip%2c_norsk_folkemuseum_nf.1906-2166.jpg ) , from the period denmark-norway were united . 
  you 're right in that some of them were gifts from people who survived distress , while others are given in memory of deceased persons . 
  there is another reason they 're featured in churches , they 're symbolic , the main room of the church is called the nave ( see the model ships ' name ) . 
  the word comes from latin * navis * ( ship ) . 
  in danish/norwegian this room is called a `` church ship '' ( * kirkeskip * ) . 
  in christian literature , the ship is often used as a symbol for the church . 
  this symbolism is based on the story of noah 's ark and the story of jesus calming the storm . 
   in my personal experience cigarettes is a women drug , because i know so many females that are smoking . 
  but i think my perception may be distorted , because women generally have a different approach to showing that they are smoking . 
  maybe males are more likely to hide it and/or be less satisfied with their habit . 
  yeah , i had the same impression , and i thought the data supported me as well . 
  perhaps , it 's just a certain age group i 've read about , maybe it was women (  25-30 ) and older (  60 ) , but i ca n't be bothered to search , hehe . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i think i 've read something about the changing patterns of smoking ; men had a reduced share , while certain women smoked more ( unknown age group ) . 
  my country 's statistics bureau [ says this is the overall trend . 
  ] ( https://www.ssb.no/helse/statistikker/royk/_image/291348.png?_encoded=2f66666666666678302f35382f29303136286874646977656c616373&amp;_ts=159bc4589d8 ), 
  it probably matters where in denmark you went ( low income = more smoking ) . 
   denmark : is basically part of germany for all intents and purposes . 
  that 's not an insult - they did actually apply to become part of germany once ... of course , germany later stole parts of their country instead . 
  okay then , 
   a few extra letters ( umlauts mainly ) the turkish alphabet has 29 letters , not the standard 26 , and three typical letters are n't included ( q , w and x ) . 
  they 're not just umlauts and it 's rather important to note . 
  similarly , in my language , [ ' \u00f8 ' is not an ` o ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%98 ) , ' \u00e5 ' is not an ` a ' , etc. 
  they 're not pronounced the same way , they 're not sorted the same way , etc. 
  yes , but unlike germany and mexico there 's a reason : those who called it `` the ukraine '' in english must have known that the word meant `` borderland '' , says anatoly liberman , a professor at the university of minnesota with a specialism in etymology . 
  so they referred to it as `` the borderland '' . 
  that 's just evil !, 
  they dress up in [ `` blackface '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blackface ) . 
  `` you were asking for it ! '', 
  some guy explained that latino in spanish is not the same as the english . 
  obviously , canada is great !, 
   american culture is better what culture ? 
  `` lies , damned lies , and statistics '', 
  the author of the map obviously knows that though , that 's the whole joke . 
  like any good norwegian i take [ cod liver oil ] ( https://draxe.com/cod-liver-oil/ ) and eat [ \\ [ fatty \\ ] fish ] ( https://authoritynutrition.com/11-health-benefits-of-fish/ ) several times a week !, 
  i do n't need to take further supplements , 
  at least you know that it was n't meant as an insult , just a little teasing from your neighbors , 
  bah , you guys are just our offspring . 
  thanks for taking the time to reply  ah , now that you mention it , i do remember reading about the french languages and asl . 
  i imagine you would have a harder time with others such as `` mine '' ( [ see examples ] ( http://www.minetegn.no/tegnbanken-2016/index.php#banken ) ) . 
  funny how languages evolve and so typical of scholars !, 
  yes , i agree , that 's my point . 
  the dutch were great !, 
  everyone else is just making copies . 
  oh , i must have mixed them up , thanks !, 
  ok , i thought you guys would know , hehe . 
  i thought you guys said it was french , 
   is n't norwegian more similar to danish than to dutch . . 
  yes , a lot more . 
  however , if you know norwegian/dutch , english and some german you 'll quickly see how similar they all are !, 
  i had german , english , french in school , dutch is just another dialect to me . 
  i ca n't speak it , but i can understand it . 
  in the past we also traveled a lot to the netherlands for trade and the word exchange went both ways . 
  norwegian has a lot of german and dutch words , in addition to obviously being a germanic language . 
   i 'm learning norwegian atm and was told that the bokm\u00e5l originated from the danish language it did , more or less . 
  bokm\u00e5l is a modern version and today is far from the original riksm\u00e5l ( dano-norwegian ) . 
  bokm\u00e5l is however just the written standard , the spoken versions are quite different . 
  good one !, 
  i 've never seen anyone describe it like that before , it 's so perfect !, 
  ( i know the chinese standards ), 
  if only . 
  those texts are usually more danish than norwegian due to their spelling . 
  it 's probably easier for us to read . 
  at least i 've seen some truly terrible combinations of what was * supposed * to be dk/no . 
  we do love to get '' [ sauced ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sauced ) '' !, 
  hehe , that 's amusing . 
  i 've been trying to learn a little , just for fun . 
  how do you cope with the variation between asl and other sign languages ? 
  i know they can be very different , but can you make do ? 
  do you create pidgin sign languages ? 
  we 're all in the same [ language ] family ... 
  it 's quite simple , [ the catholic church .

  you do n't know why ?!,
