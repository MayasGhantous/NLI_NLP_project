  i 'm embarrassed by all of the copycats . 
  i just hope my country avoids making one . 
  hopefully we 'll create a good parody of the copycats !, 
  he 's literally saying that danes speak english well and better than the germans . 
  furthermore , you could get by with only english in germany , but it 's * even * better in denmark !, 
   having a blue water navy with the ability to project military force across the globe do you now ? 
  hms elizabeth is not due to come into service until 2020 and hms prince of wales some years after . 
  trident is a few years away , right ? 
  last i heard you guys had to use the * french * aircraft carrier . 
   the uk is the 5th largest economy in the world though . 
  nope , old news , [ india is now the 5th largest .

  the norwegian is wrong ( text ! = audio ) . 
   even in states like georgia . 
  yeah , georgia has lots of strong competition . 
   they 're miscellaneous europeans they most certainly are not . 
  they 're ethnically caucasians , but they 're not `` european '' . 
   immigration tends to contribute to economic growth and creates new jobs along the way . 
  that 's hardly typical of all kinds of immigrant , non-europeans do it more than europeans according to what i 've read . 
   there is no such thing as a fixed number of jobs that has to be divided between your countrymen and immigrants . 
  the brits working in my country for example typically works in the oil & gas industry . 
  the number of jobs is fixed in that industry these days . 
  ah , shetland , you were part of us for so long , and still could be . 
  in fact , [ orkney , shetland and the hebrides , ] ( http://www.transceltic.com/sites/default/files/images/celtsvikings/kingdomofmannandtheisles.png ) were once part of the kingdom . 
  while `` up helly aa '' is certainly interesting , i find [ this video of them celebrating norwegian constitution day in kirkwall even more so .

  they regularly violate their airspace , what 's a few words ... 
   should obviously get a permanent residence permit . 
  economically , i wonder if it would n't be better to force them home . 
  if they 're working in my country they 're bound to have jobs my citizens [ or europeans ] could take . 
  it 's unfair on those british that voted to remain , but they can always apply for local citizenship . 
   the monroe doctrine are you from the past ? 
  i certainly did n't like the power it gave corporations over countries . 
   it 's what native/truly fluent people nah , only the natives . 
  students of foreign languages tend use more formal and correct grammar . 
   designed by artists who had never seen a real lion . 
  no , they 're * artistic * depictions . 
  the heraldic symbols are based on older styles and depictions . 
  they 're not supposed to be lifelike , they 're [ traditional ] art and symbols . 
  europe had lions in the past , so the accurate imagery you 're thinking of would existed in books/sculptures . 
   tv5monde asia tv5monde is a global television network , broadcasting several channels of french language programming . 
  it 's important to note that norway 's not split along the `` obvious '' lines . 
  [ this is a map of norway 's regions . 
  ] ( http://norwayathome.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/regions-of-norway.png ), 
  [ the `` south '' of norway ] ( http://norwayathome.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/regions-of-norway.png ) is a bit smaller than what you would first imagine . 
  we 're all mountains and fjords !, 
  norway got the beautiful landscapes , sweden got a few trees , 
  you 're welcome , neighbor !, 
  syria was very civilized , secular and had lots of french connections . 
  just like lebanon . 
  they are former french mandates after all . 
  [ here 's a very good bbc documentary about the syrian school system and society . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iudxznlkm6y ), 
  you had to pick the one country where sweden is the leading western embassy !, 
  xd their relationship with north korea is unique . 
  until 2001 , sweden was the ** only ** western country with diplomatic representation in the country dating back to the 1970s . 
  seven eu countries now have embassies in the capital pyongyang , including the uk and germany . 
  sweden functions as protective power for the ** united states ** , australia and canada , including consular responsibility for citizens . 
  the embassy further has consular responsibility for all nordic citizens , and handles schengen visa applications on behalf of italy , spain and the nordic countries . 
  interestingly , it was boris johnson 's reporting that mislead the brits on this . 
   for example if i as a finnish person went to a swedish embassy , i 'd be very surprised if they 'd refuse to help . 
  that 's quite different from the relationship the french have with the british . 
  it was certainly historically very different . 
  now , with brexit they will once again be on opposite sides . 
  yes , we were torn between different outlooks , and spheres of influence . 
  i believe it was primarily a problem of handing over sovereignty . 
  norway certainly did n't want to enter another [ kalmar ] union !, 
  to be clear we would be fine with a union of equals , but the previous unions had turned out otherwise . 
  finland probably had similar thoughts about swedish dominance . 
  finland was forced by the ussr to stay neutral and could n't join nato . 
  sweden did n't want to join nato , but did want finland along . 
  denmark and norway helped found nato so that matter was already settled in a sense when it was raised in the nordic council . 
   norway protects their small farms . 
  just to be clear , yes , but more importantly we 're protecting the land , rural population and our self-sufficiency ( war time ) . 
  we do n't want a repeat of what happened during both wwi or wwii ( no imports ) . 
  we also do n't want urbanization to weaken our country 's periphery . 
   that being said , when it comes to diplomatic issues , the nordic countries will help each other , with or without the eu . 
  i certainly hope we can and want to continue to do so , 
  we formally cooperate with them on a per country basis . 
  the swedish embassy for example may officially handle our visa business/citizens in countries where we do n't have our own offices . 
  in berlin our embassies are located in the same building , which we designed together for this purpose . 
  if we do n't have consulates in a city and the others do , our citizens may seek their help . 
  on a less formal basis i think we can generally count on the others to help our citizens . 
  we had great ambitions and plans under the banner of the nordic council ( see our existing passport union and freedom of movement ) . 
  an economic and defense union was in the works before the whole nato , eec/eu thing got in the way . 
  ah , yes , in that sense . 
  i 'm only joking . 
  the video is amusing . 
  let 's leave it at that , 
  that 's true , but [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37ihswa1swe ) makes it all clear !, 
  i ca n't speak for the others , but it certainly works for scandinavians . 
  the scandinavian and nordic countries [ embassies and consulates ] already worked like this . 
  yes , minister . 
  very nordic and slightly `` 2001 : a space odyssey '', 
  i fully agree !, 
   thankfully norway 's crude is among the least competitive as the profit margin is steadily disappearing . 
  it strikes me that you do n't really know the business or the changing circumstances . 
  the profit margin improved dramatically recently since the fixed costs were slashed .
