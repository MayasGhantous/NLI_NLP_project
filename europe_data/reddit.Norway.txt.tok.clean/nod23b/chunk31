  it was the first farmers from the near east that carried the light skin genes for example . 
  finally , it 's possible that ukraine could be [ our ancestral home . 
  ] ( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/mysterious-indo-european-homeland-may-have-been-steppes-ukraine-and-russia ), 
  i had similar thoughts about my own country . 
  it 's a bit unfair to countries like ireland and norway . 
  on the one hand we were colonies ( [ denmark-norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denmark%e2%80%93norway ) ) , on the other we probably had citizens working in the colonies ( danish colonies in [ the caribbean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_west_indies ) , [ india ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/european_settlements_in_india_1501-1739.png ) ) . 
  algeria is at odds with your claim . 
   i think only like 100 or so settlers ever actually arrived according to wikipedia , in 1940 , just five years after mussolini 's conquest of this african country , the italians residents in ethiopia were nearly 40,000 . 
  added to the colonists were temporary italian labourers ( often forced conscripts as punishment by the fascist government ) , who came to work in the construction of the ethiopian infrastructures , calculated in nearly 200,000 in five years . 
  neither do we [ in my part of norway ] !, 
  i wonder if it 's the milkshake ? 
   is it popular in norway ? 
  i believe it has popular support . 
  at least in my experience it 's seen as a formative experience . 
  a good foundation for young people to come of age . 
  it 's highly respected even if you were just a grunt . 
  the social contract aspect is strong here . 
  a typical belief is that for immature young men it 's especially good because they learn about personal responsibility , teamwork and gain independence [ from their parents ] . 
  many gain real skills and an education there , from driving lessons to mechanics , war college to engineering degrees . 
   in the uk its unpopular with the armed forces i 'm not sure . 
  i imagine the leadership does n't want it , but for different reasons . 
  our focus is currently on building capacity for the future and capital-intensive investments . 
  while the numbers of professional soldiers will increase , conscription remains the official basis of our armed forces . 
  we recruit our professional soldiers from the conscripts after service or education . 
  the home guard is still an active component of our defense strategy ( rapid mobilization force ) . 
  we realize that modern warfare requires less manpower and more advanced weapons . 
  so we 've made big plans and have invested in : - new f-35 fighter jets , - a new fleet of fighting vehicles ( cv-90 ) , - upgraded main battle tanks , - new frigates and various combat boats , - and new intelligence ships . 
  - while we 're looking for new submarines and artillery , etc. 
  the new focus and expensive purchases we 're making , has already lead to cuts in military bases . 
  conscription is bound to be a loser in the fight for resources . 
   anyone with at least some brains believe those stories . 
  i 'm afraid in this era of fake news , many will believe . 
  that 's good to hear !, 
  i got the impression it was a prominent tv channel . 
  [ so do we . 
  ] ( http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/norway-introduces-compulsory-military-service-for-women-bunking-them-in-mixed-dorms ), 
  lithuania has some seriously stupid so-called `` journalists '' !, 
  on the other hand they 're also found in hungary , romania , etc. 
  i do n't know if i can blame the people for believing the false stories and lies they 're fed . 
  we have it here in norway . 
  we also have conscription ( men and women ) . 
  you may end up in the reserves ( home guard ) in addition to national service ( 1 year ) . 
  we have it though , for women and men . 
   the atheist population become majority and religions decline . 
  hopefully so !, 
  to accomplish that future we need equal opportunities for all , free education , fair shares , and meaningful days . 
  let us hope it comes soon , especially for those that have the least . 
  there are significant variations in the realization of pitch accent between dialects . 
  thus , in most of western and northern norway ( the so-called high-pitch dialects ) accent 1 is falling , while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary . 
  in norwegian , you may also struggle with certain similar looking words : - f\u00f4r `` lining , fodder '' , - for , the preposition ( for/to ) , - f\u00f3r ( went ) , - f\u00f2r ( furrow ) and - f\u00f4r ( fodder ) . 
  it appears you 've accidentally applied for norwegian citizenship , by writing a perfect sentence in norwegian , and mocking a swede . 
  thus completing all the requirements ; demonstrating good knowledge of norwegian language , history and culture !, 
   where would you like your passport sent ? 
  the tonal word accents give norwegian and swedish a `` singing '' quality which makes it fairly easy to distinguish them from other languages . 
  in danish ( except for some southern dialects ) , the pitch accent of swedish and norwegian corresponds to the glottalization phenomenon known as st\u00f8d . 
  norwegian and swedish have two kinds of pitch accent on the stressed syllable of words of more than one syllable . 
  the two pitch accents are lexically distinct . 
  one is the ` simple ' or ` acute ' tone , known also as tone 1 or toneme 1 . 
  the other is the ` compound ' or ` grave ' tone , ton ( em ) e 2 . 
  - the classical minimal pair for norwegian is b\u00f8nder \u02c8b\u0153n\u02d0\u0259r ` farmers , peasants ' vs. b\u00f8nner \u02c7b\u0153n\u02d0\u0259r ` beans ' . 
  - the classical minimal pair for swedish is anden \u02c8and\u0259n ` the duck ' ( from and ` duck ' ) vs. anden \u02c7and\u0259n ` the spirit ' ( from ande ` spirit ' ) . 
  - another swedish example is the '' \u00c4r tomten p\u00e5 tomten ? '', 
  ( `` is santa claus out in the yard ? 
  he was [ intentionally ] interpreting it as norwegian , which gives different results . 
   an european cooperation the first thing i think about is [ this kind of european corporation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/societas_europaea ), 
  yes , speaking of `` shet '' , we also settled and owned [ the shetland islands  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dv2dqa2.png ) as well as iceland , greenland , scotland , ireland , isle of man and orkney . 
  yes , that 's true , but the claim the article makes is that `` the ecb is preparing for the end of the eurozone '' and `` a break-up of the eurozone '' . 
  those are rather final and different from exclusion . 
  he must have worked for the daily mail previously or been an understudy to boris . 
  yes , above that line : `` the peculiarity of the national structure of the population of ukraine is its * multinational * composition . 
  according to all-ukrainian population census data , the representatives of more than 130 nationalities and ethnic groups live on the territory of the country . '', 
  we did , when we settled them , around the 9th century . 
  `` sheep islands '' . 
  `` gefira '' does n't look like a very credible source . 
  heck , it looks like a made to order conclusion based on little serious evidence . 
  `` the ecb is preparing ... '' , bullshit !, 
  to be fair he was probably using the language of his own country , where they do speak about [ ethnic \\ [ nations \\ ] within the country ; \\ ( poles , belarusians , russians , jews \\ ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_ukraine#after_world_war_ii ) jews are n't a race , but in some contexts it 's an identity . 
  oh , i see he included a link to [ the census ] ( http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/ ) , where it 's also clear . 
   hannukkah is just about the oil in a lamp lasting longer than it was expected to . 
  hehe , as if other miracles are any better !, 
  a burning bush for example ?!, 
  you do make good points though , about [ yom kippur ( day of atonement ) ] ( http://www.chabad.org/holidays/jewishnewyear/template_cdo/aid/4687/jewish/yom-kippur.htm ) and [ rosh hashanah ( jewish new year ) ] ( http://www.chabad.org/holidays/jewishnewyear/template_cdo/aid/4762/jewish/what-is-rosh-hashanah.htm ) . 
  yes , perhaps germany reports on the nuts 1 level . 
  the nuts 2 level in germany is [ regierungsbezirke . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/deutschland_nuts1_und_nuts2.png ), 
   why do some countries have lots more divisions in them but entirety of england and wales are the same colour . 
  perhaps your government/police simply reports on a national level ? 
  it seems logical that scotland and ni would report theirs separately due to devolution . 
   no county boundaries the other european countries on the map are shown using nuts 2 region levels , which is not the logical unit for my country for example . 
  yep , that 's important for many reasons , but our `` core '' resource is actually our population . 
  we 've calculated that our workers are more worth to our economy than oil . 
  a highly educated workforce in a high-tech economy , with high participation levels ( women and men ) . 
  which means czechia could do the same given time , 
  indeed , that 's not implicit ? 
   too bad we will not find oil here too oh , you think we did n't have money before that ?!, 
  sorry , norway has lots of natural resources which we 've historically exported ( forestry , fisheries , minerals , heavy industry , manufactured goods ) . 
  in terms of gdp we 've been richer than our neighbors for the last three centuries . 
  norway found oil in the last 1960s , and began earning money in the 1990s .
