  [ here 's a simple map to explain it ; it shows the gdp in europe ( 1938 vs 2016 ) . 
   you are not investing more . 
  we currently own  1,25 % of the * world 's * shares , and plenty of property ( real estate ) around the world . 
  we 're continuously investing and buying more . 
  especially , when the world 's economy goes badly , we buy more shares with a `` discount '' . 
   the vast majority of europeans are n't multicultural and are completely ok with it . 
  how can you be so sure about this ? 
  the majority of people in europe live in cities , the cities are usually very multicultural in [ western ] europe . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i do n't remember the situation in detail , but a few years back i helped run factories in poland and lithuania . 
  i guess we did have higher salary costs in lithuania , but it was still better for our line of business ( other factors ) . 
   norwegians go to sweden to shop too . 
  yes , because we 're paid much more ( real terms ) , and the prices are lower in sweden . 
  the currency exchange rate was better in the past . 
  of course , only a tiny part of the population make this a habit ( border area ) . 
  yes , of course , this is made by radiofreeeurope/radioliberty ... a united states government-funded broadcasting organization ( see cold war ) . 
  we have our own slang for currency [ in our languages ] . 
  yes , that was certainly part of it . 
  the shopping patterns were also blamed . 
  - norwegians do n't shop weekly , we shop daily . 
  this is the * typical * pattern , it does n't apply to everyone , but it 's the industry 's own conclusion ( based on sales/research ) . 
  - non-european immigrants were noticeable at lidl , in my own experience , which says something about their attractive prices !, 
  it may have created an unfortunate stigma ( low class ) . 
  actually , $ 3500/month is a lot lower than the average wage ( 518.000 nok in 2015 ) . 
  i would also question the `` new jobs '' part , there is n't unlimited space for supermarkets . 
  people wo n't suddenly start shopping twice the amount they did before . 
  someone loses their job/market share . 
  those jobs will have to come at the expense of existing retailers . 
  i do n't see how lidl can grow their market share significantly without someone losing . 
  people can only spend so much more of their disposable income on groceries . 
   for leaving their political union . 
  political , * economic * and more ( including defense , border control ) . 
   lidl does great everywhere tho lidl did so badly in norway that they pulled out and sold their stores to the competition ... 
   nevertheless , the word ` scandinavia ' has a double meaning in the english language , and in casual , non-scientific use it can refer to the nordics more generally . 
  just to point out that in german , scandinavia is norway , finland and sweden . 
  no denmark . 
  foreigners appear to define scandinavia incorrectly every way we look . 
  they may do so , but it 's technically not correct all the same . 
  we define ourselves , not some ignorant outsiders from europe or the us . 
  you guys have snow ? 
  we do n't have any in my part of norway :( i 've only seen [ some frost on the trees in my garden . 
  the man has good taste in music !, 
  boris johnson has an account on reddit ? 
  oh , do n't worry , we all know southern european countries just do n't report suicides properly because they 're more religious . 
  finland is n't scandinavian . 
   they basically created ... the \u00c5re ski resort in the late 1800 's . 
  thanks , that was interesting to hear !, 
   weird how face structures seem to change  i look at these photos and struggle to find someone that i would be like yeps , definitely norwegian life was harder then and it took a toll on their faces . 
  they look odd compared with modern day people . 
  we 're healthier in most respects and better fed today . 
  as people did n't move around as much , they probably married within their village/valley/region . 
  they probably had more distinct features that are watered down today due to wider mixing . 
  eh , did you not notice the photo with the sign ? 
  the english speaking sign , only there to attract random tourists to stop by !, 
  i never doubted you were . 
  however , i 'm complaining about the fact that you 're saying norwegian [ farm ] properties are cheap in general . 
  from the west coast to inner eastern norway , property costs a lot more than it should . 
  a few exceptions exist , in certain regions , but in general ? 
  i do n't think you 're giving the right impression . 
  baby jesus had a beard ? 
  yes , [ it 's pretty nice in hell , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrisnjevmfq ) despite it freezing over every year . 
   that can bought for practically no money no , these photos were from all over the place . 
  property is n't cheap anywhere in norway . 
  you would be surprised to learn the prices . 
  thanks , even though i had seen them already , it does n't seem like we have lost too much . 
  we 've kept a lot of our history and buildings alive . 
  these images are from the public archives of norwegian counties . 
  those who are interested [ should easily be able to find them ] ( http://www.arkivverket.no/arkivverket/tema/foto ) ( [ this page ] ( https://foto.digitalarkivet.no/fotoweb/archives/5003-historiske%20foto/ ) in particular ) . 
  the national digital archives can be [ searched and browsed here . 
  ] ( https://media.digitalarkivet.no/en/ ) all of our historic church books ( census ) are also digital and public . 
  the british were among the first tourists to visit norway . 
  as early as the 1850s , they began to explore norwegian fjords and mountains . 
  in 1859 , the first tourist guide to norway for foreigners appeared , written in english . 
  over the years , the main lure of norway has been its natural beauty - the midnight sun , the northern lights , the intricate contours of the fjords , the variations in the landscape from north to south , the extremes of summer and winter , the islands and inlets . 
  the germans also visited frequently . 
  kaiser wilhelm loved visiting norway and [ did so annually ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smy_hohenzollern ) on the hohenzollern ii . 
  he brought with him his entourage on his cruises and trips . 
  he only put it off when wwi broke out . 
  the late 1700s and early 1800s had witnessed a rapid growth of interest in northern countries among german speakers , partly due to the popularity of the idea of a common culture and origin of the germanic tribes . 
  a subject that would gain even more popularity ... 
  in 1902 germans made up 17 % of visitors to norway , only surpassed by british and other scandinavians . 
  at least trump is of german origin , so you can blame them for him , 
  that joke requires a lot of w\u00f6rk . 
   i hope that it will be one of the scandinavian countries which will face the russian aggression . 
  haha , you 're not even a good troll . 
  i already speak russian , so it 's not a problem for me . 
  do n't worry , your country will burn long before ours ever does , as nobody cares about your eastern block whore factory . 
   norway is spending less than 2 % yeah , we do . 
  it 's a problem that will adjust itself quite easily . 
  since we export oil our gdp is huge , but not really spendable without creating lots of problems . 
  we have the money , we just do n't spend it . 
  now , that our oil revenue is falling our percentage will go up without lifting a finger ... 
   you gon na have to care about your own ass without us support no , i think you 've misunderstood . 
  the us ** will ** protects its allies , but it 's changing the rules ( i.e. 
  money ) . 
  that 's ** not ** unexpected or new , it pre-dates trump by several years . 
  the current head of nato has said this for the last year , and he 's norwegian ... 
  the us will protect its allies because it 's in their interest ( see trade , markets , etc ) . 
  they make money here and do n't want to lose power , influence or markets . 
  europe is part of their sphere of influence .
