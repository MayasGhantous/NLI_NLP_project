   i totally love how these `` western european '' funny armies are shitting their own pants . 
  you seem like a very ignorant person . 
  norway protects its own territory , but it would require nato allies to defend against a full russian invasion . 
  that 's simple math . 
  however , norway 's govt/military does ** not ** consider russia a threat . 
  we 've * never * had a conflict with russia ever !, 
  for over a thousand years !, 
  sweden and finland have fought russia many times . 
  norway has an `` open border '' agreement with russia ; citizens of each country , along the border , are free to visit . 
  how `` scared '' could we possibly be ?!, 
  norway invests in its armed forces ; we 've even bought the us ' most advanced fighter jets . 
  we do n't think the russians will attack , but they 've become * unpredictable * . 
  that 's a good reason to carry a big stick , just in case . 
  well , i think it 's more of a play , to get trump to set policy . 
  if russia hears trump say it , it will certainly help clear any ambiguity about the new relationship . 
   why norway still practices commercial whaling haha , that 's the biggest problem you could find !? 
  norway pays to clean up * russian * soil because it 's so polluted and dangerous !, 
  i like russia , but this makes me laugh !, 
  it does sound likely  it 's not the only one in the north though ( see baltics ) . 
  i assume other nato navy ships visit now and then , but not on patrol in our waters . 
  we do host the annual nato exercise [ `` cold response '' ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/cold-response-2016-military-exercise-2016-3?r=us&amp;ir=t&amp;ir=t/#the-special-operators-transported-distinguished-visitors-from-shore-to-norwegian-navy-ships-8 ) , which includes all branches . 
  [ this year the spanish navy visited trondheim ] ( https://forsvaret.no/en/newsroom/news-stories/spanish-warships ) , with esps \u00c1lvaro de baz\u00e1n and esps cantabria , on their way further north . 
  in recent years we have had several [ frigates ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/fr_nansen_frigates_oslo.jpg ) built at [ navantia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navantia ), 
  came to here say that !, 
  * [ the government of the german state of schleswig-holstein ] ( http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/de/landesregierung/landesregierung_node.html ), 
  remarkably job poor by google translate . 
  `` anschlusszeit '' does come out that way !, 
  from one germanic language to another it really should work ( compounding ) . 
  are you sure you 're not confused by the shared nato monitoring of [ iceland 's airspace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/icelandic_air_policing ) or the baltics ? 
  i see spain took part in the [ baltic air policing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) . 
  that 's another region completely . 
  norway covers its own territory * alone * , by land , sea and air . 
  we have [ this european air control zone ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/exploit/2013/06/memo/en/m13_525.eni/pictures/1000000000000db5000009ae2fe2e902.jpg ) for example . 
  while we have [ this arctic rescue zone . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/syzrhd1.gif ) our [ eez in europe looks like this . 
  ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/profile/rachel_tiller/publication/279201715/figure/fig1/as:294316418322435@1447181910668/fig-1-a-map-of-the-svalbard-fisheries-protection-zone-northernmost-area-and.png ), 
  well , we have invested in * two * spy ships for use in this region now . 
  the old ( 1995 ) and new marjata ( 2016 ) . 
  which probably has a lot to do with the tourism industry and recent troubles . 
  the projected tourism revenue for turkey in [ 2017 ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-tourism-players-warn-of-bigger-losses-in-2017.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=100814&amp;newscatid=349 ) is expected to drop even further by comparison with this year . 
  just yesterday norwegian operators announced they would practically have no flights to turkey at all due to lack of demand ( i.e. 
  fear ) . 
  i imagine it 's fairly typical for european countries . 
  could it possibly be because they were minors * at the time * of application ? 
  many of them have been in the country several years now while waiting for their application to be finished and consequently appealing ( one or more times ) . 
  norwegian law considers you an adult at 18 . 
  that 's called nato  yes , even sweden cooperates . 
  it probably has more to do with the negative attention surrounding it . 
  though i doubt the foundation 's programs were fraudulent . 
  we audit our donations independently . 
  norway certainly did n't get anything out of the clintons . 
  we gave * them * money , remember ? 
   our economy is linked to europe and oil , but i guess another middle eastern war could help the oil price . 
  clinton was hawkish . 
  on the other hand we supported the foundation years before her campaign . 
  she was never `` useful '' to norway . 
  this was about international programs . 
  norway 's post has expanded to the neighboring countries . 
  sweden and denmark united and did the same . 
  i think you misunderstood , they 're linked , not unified . 
  there 's still two networks and duplicate administrations . 
  it 's about cooperation , not savings . 
  the * king * of the animal world ... a very royal symbol . 
  it 's the king of the animal world ... a symbol of royalty . 
  yeah , that 's very likely , i mean the numbers are probably small by comparison . 
  oh , nd , i almost went to uni there !, 
  they advertised the need to light a fire under your car , the need to keep an emergency pack in your car at all times , etc. 
  yeah , i did n't go :d i know the `` norsk h\u00f8stfest '' though , i used to read about it in the `` sons of norway '' magazine . 
  i do n't really eat lutefisk , but do n't tell anyone !, 
  i prefer * fresh * fish !, 
  i wonder if you 've noticed the new wave of `` snowbirds '' migrating from norway ? 
  we 've really flocked to florida in recent years . 
  i 'm not sure that 's true . 
  trade is a two-way street . 
  turkey benefits greatly from the trade access . 
  their expats send home tons of money/investments . 
  you could n't be more wrong about the relationship , it 's mutually beneficial . 
  however , what 's the biggest market and who benefits the most from turkish cheap labor/products ? 
  at least in 2016 we can finally blame germany , not austria , for a crazy right-wing world leader ... , 
  hmm , ca n't tell if you 're confusing my flag for the uk or not . 
  i eat fish , not `` chips '' , you fat burger eating bastard !, 
  :d we 're doing stereotypes , right ? 
  hmm , i 'm not sure if you 'll like it . 
  [ see this article on the eu 's english . 
  ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/9c896238-3a0e-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7 ) `` the english spoken by eu functionaries has already deviated from the british norm , as a publication titled `` misused english words and expressions in eu publications '' shows . 
  the document lists nearly 100 words and expressions which it says european officials get wrong . '', 
  `` published by the european court of auditors , which monitors the eu 's financial management , the document says : `` over the years , the european institutions have developed a vocabulary that differs from that of any other recognised form of english . '' for example , eu documents use the word `` actual '' to mean `` happening now '' rather than something real or existing . 
  yes , except this is actually a currency thing ( eur vs gbp ) . 
  on the other hand there is no official european english yet . 
  i checked , it 's not political at all . 
  it 's language * and * currency : - eu : english interface and euros - uk : english interface and pounds, 
  when mali 's legitimate government asks for it ? 
  why not ? 
  exactly !, 
  that could be quite useful in the coming years . 
  navigating in the [ norwegian sea ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wuw9fsq.gif ) , [ barents sea ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/barents.gif ) and [ arctic ocean ] ( http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/47/99647-004-5cc77bd0.jpg ) is increasingly important . 
  yes , of course , [ it will be ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/navigation/galileo/what_is_galileo ) , but galileo comes with the added benefit of precise positioning in cities , where gps falls short today . 
  it 'll also actually work in all of my country and the far north . 
  it 's more than an alternative , it 'll give * much * better resolution in cities .
