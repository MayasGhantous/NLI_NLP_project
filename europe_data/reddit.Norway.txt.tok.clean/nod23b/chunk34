  it has/had that meaning in norwegian as well , but we 've since added yet * another * meaning to it as well  when a situation becomes more complicated or costly than previously expected , you may have to reluctantly accept a few camels in order to achieve your goals . 
  it 's frequently used in a political context . 
  for example when a government or party has to accept * major * changes to a policy in order to get their bill passed . 
  they may even be * unpalatable * changes , but compromise is the nordic way . 
   the masses of homeless people begging for money . 
  they were everywhere . 
  they 're mostly `` professional '' beggars from romania visiting for the summer season . 
  they 're about as homeless as you . 
  this reminds me of [ this norwegian parody of finnish music \\ ( see `` thanks for the bucket '' \\ ) . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/loy7quyojam?t=103 ), 
  that 's a good point !, 
  yeah , i 've seen it in person , it 's a state like place , 
  at least it does look a little neo-classical . 
  yes , but which century ? 
  yeah , but they did spend a long time looking at placement and land for it . 
  in the end it 's a product of what was available and where it was most fitting to put it ( opposite the palace ) . 
  thanks , i might be too `` familiar '' with it , that 's all . 
  we 're gaining more weight ( overall ) , we 're richer than ever before , eating more meat and moving about less . 
  generally , it 's a lifestyle change . 
  i wonder how much immigration [ from poland to somalia ] changes the stats . 
  they tend to be less educated . 
  the same as in english , it 's offensive . 
  thanks , i guess what you 're used to also influences your views on others , 
  we like our fish [ and omega 3 oil ] in norway . 
  at least [ it 's nice on the inside . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lxeyh ) looking at it from outside again , [ it does n't look too bad . 
  yeah , it really is , even more in person . 
  i makes me a little sad because it reminds me of my country 's parliament designs . 
  ours was designed several decades prior to hungary 's , but we dropped that look for [ something rather bland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/stortinget_2014.jpg ) . 
  here 's [ one example of what we could have had . 
  the tourism industry in budapest probably benefits quite a bit . 
  came here to say this :d, 
  why not ? 
  it would be very fitting ; an idea come to life , that joins europe together !, 
  they even used fictional bridges for the artwork so that they would n't be tied to any one nation . 
  the dutch proceeded to create every one of those bridges , 
  i really like it !, 
  china has suffered many [ attacks ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/29/xinjiang-attack-four-terrorists-and-one-bystander-killed-says-china ) by muslim terrorists , in china and [ abroad ] ( http://time.com/4473748/china-terrorism-uighur-xinjiang/ ) . 
  there 's a reason [ `` isis threatens china and vows to ` shed blood like rivers ' '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-china-threaten-terror-attack-muslim-islamist-group-islamic-state-a7606211.html ), 
   the reason terrorist attacks have n't occured in china what ?!, 
  there have been many terrorist attacks by muslims in china in recent years . 
  chinese media does n't talk much about it though . 
  [ here 's one example . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/29/xinjiang-attack-four-terrorists-and-one-bystander-killed-says-china ), 
  nah , they 're a small minority and not a problem . 
  they 're well integrated by comparison with germany and the uk . 
  youth unemployment is really bad , but i understand that the numbers look even worse [ due to people working off the books . 
  ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/02/15/italy-youth-unemployment-feeds-black-labour ), 
   i just can not imagine how it is possible to do nothing . 
  it 's probably due to economic circumstances for many . 
  it costs money to study in some countries and the job market may be bleak . 
  in some southern countries many work off the books , which means their stats look even worse . 
   wow thats an amazing opinion to hear . 
   i never considered buoys as anything except an recommendation or swimming beyond them as dangerous . 
  i wonder if the lifeguards feel that by ignoring the warning and risking your life you 're * also * effectively risking their lives ? 
  if they have to attempt to rescue you , which they may feel duty bound to do , their lives are also at stake thanks to his actions . 
  indeed , that 's the beauty of books , 
  good question !, 
  i know it 's not the focus of / books , there is [ some interest ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3hl2tv/15_scifi_books_you_should_definitely_read/ ) , but there seems to be a few subreddits i did n't know about !, 
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi_bookclub/ - https://www.reddit.com/r/printsf/ - even / scifi has a [ nice list post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/5r7rw0/16_best_science_fiction_books_to_read_in_2017/ ) [ this goodreads list ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/47731.best_hard_science_fiction_of_the_21st_century ) includes most of my favorite authors . 
  thanks , i might just do that , 
  oh , wow , that 's considerable . 
  we 've seen some inflation here as well recently , with no effective increase in pay . 
  [ until you realize they were mice !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/art_spiegelman_-_maus_%281972%29_page_1_panel_3.png ), 
  when did it become expensive ? 
  it 's funny , a few years back we had a butter shortage ( due to our farmer 's ) and it was widely mocked . 
  now , i read europe is suffering from too little butter on the market !, 
  ah , of course , discworld . 
  i do n't like fantasy , only hard sci-fi , so i 've never read any of his work . 
  that 's not cheese , it 's in the name ( - mes ) in other words `` whey '' . 
  the [ real goat cheese in norway ] ( https://kolonial.no/produkter/1246-tine-gudbrandsdalsost-g35-500g/?gclid=cj0kcqjwildmbrdfarisacnmix8oy4vrhafa-i76sb3bqgochwiq_5xlbfbtvwkg_6tgqj0-tnzknwiaattcealw_wcb ) is marked as such . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3kbuqhhkx0 ), 
  i think you 're misreading this ? 
  i 'm not describing norway , i 'm describing what happens when oil is booming - and takes a country 's economy for a ride . 
  a ride that frequently goes up and down . 
  beer and porn are clearly great exports :d i think norwegians know you best for praha , so there 's that . 
  i have a few czech friends here , they tell some interesting tales about life in czechia . 
   granted when it comes to more than tenth of your economy it will take some effort , and probably pain yes , only 1 % of workers work in the oil & gas industry now . 
  while the industries that supplied those oil companies now focus on their other markets ( ship building , other engineering works , exports , etc ) . 
  it was easier for some of them since they used large pools of foreign workers that worked on short term contracts ( polish ship yard workers for example ) . 
  i would say it 's quite small , especially by comparison with the nations you mentioned . 
  people on the internet seem to think norway is all about oil . 
  that 's strange , it was n't very popular in norway , but it 's quite popular in the us . 
  you really do n't know enough about this . 
  the oil industry drains the market for people and increases salaries , which is not good for a country as a whole . 
  oil/gas exports increases the value of your currency , which destroys businesses that rely on exporting goods . 
  that 's `` dutch disease '' in a nutshell , you would be wise to avoid it . 
  in 2016 the oil & gas industry accounted for 12 % of norway 's gdp . 
  we 're pretty diverse already . 
  we have lots of natural gas in norway as well . 
  no , you 're not seeing the full picture . 
  this is management on all levels . 
  just like legally you can be guilty of failure to act . 
  in this case the cost to nature and humans is far greater than the benefits . 
  we have lots of fishing and tourism to protect . 
  those industries are significant to norway and will last forever , but not if we damage the environment ( by polluting the sea or destroying the landscapes with installations ) . 
  of course they can , it 's was only a hundred years ago that finland was allowed a `` break '' . 
  i 'm sure russia wants to get back together again soon !, 
  it 's probably all of the above .
