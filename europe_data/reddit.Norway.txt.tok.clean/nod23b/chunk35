  norway is very long , so northern norway is more like alaska . 
  it 's a bit more like norway coast and climate wise . 
  no , only when i 'm provoked , aggressive and sleep deprived . 
  it 's in there , keep looking ( or do n't , i do n't care ) . 
  nah , they 're truncated on youtube .

   does anyone ? 
  clearly they do . 
  your personal experience is n't evidence . 
   i 've never once known anyone misuse of anecdotal evidence is an informal fallacy . 
  it is on the surface area map . 
  possibly , but it 's besides the point if ireland is there or not . 
  this map 's title says europe , but it 's actually the eu . 
  i hope it 's just an explanation of why it occurred . 
  that 's the history of the world !, 
  no culture is innocent of this . 
  to attack * only * the west for this is laughable !, 
  there 's no place it did n't happen !, 
  japan conquered and raped china and korea numerous times in the past !, 
  china conquered tibet and other regions countries . 
  africa is filled with stories of native wars and empires , from axum to timbuktu . 
  asia and the middle east has seen countless empires come and go !, 
  do you see europe complaining about the ottoman turks ? 
  the many bloody waves of mongols ? 
  how about the [ arab raiders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbary_pirates ) that made slaves of our peoples ? 
  it 's the distant past , move on !, 
  they ** do n't ** have uranium in mali !, 
  they do have it `` next door '' in [ niger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_uranium_production ) though [ where france gets it from ] . 
  i do n't see what france and europe gets out of spending money on protecting the state of mali from rebels that want to split the country in two ? 
  do you ? 
  i see a huge amount of materials , human resources and money going to protect a country that * literally * called france and asked for help !, 
  they * have * slaves in mali . 
  the tuareg rebels , which france fought , keep black africans as slaves . 
  you should read [ this article !, 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/03/families-mali-slavery-culture-conflict ), 
  ok , i 'm not op though , 
  yes , let 's leave mali alone , that will work out well !, 
  i 'm sure russia will rush to place their soldiers in harms way for their dear friend !,

  crap , i guess i copied the wrong link !, 
  what is this `` summer '' you speak of ? 
  paul delvaux painted the awakening of the forest in the late 1930s , when he adopted surrealism as a visual language to give form to his inner world -- one populated with childhood memories and fantasy . 
  for this monumental painting , the artist transformed an episode from jules verne 's journey to the center of the earth ( 1864 ) , in which professor otto lidenbrock and his nephew axel discover a prehistoric forest deep inside the earth . 
  delvaux showed the professor at left , examining a rock or fossil ; behind him stands axel , who bears a striking resemblance to the artist himself . 
  under a full moon , women appear like automatons in the background . 
  in the foreground , several figures combine human and vegetal elements ; these ambiguous figures seem to embody a primordial , as yet undifferentiated , state . 
  a woman in the right foreground and another in the left middle ground , both in victorian dress , hold lamps and try in a vain to shed light on the unyielding mystery of the scene . 
  despite the multitude of naked figures and their detailed description , the awakening of the forest retains a detached emotional quality that adds to its strange and mysterious effect . 
  you know they say hell is actually cold ... 
  i can confirm [ it is ] ( https://www.yr.no/place/norway/nord-tr%c3%b8ndelag/stj%c3%b8rdal/hell/ ), 
  that does n't sound great , but you sound like a great person !,

  it looks like it could be from a personal hell ; none of the women have vaginas ... 
  is it though ? 
  a `` two-way street '' would not mean they have to take off the veil while in europe . 
  now , i do n't like to see it [ in europe ] , but it 's not disrespectful to our culture for them to wear it . 
  in iran it 's indecent for women to be uncovered , while in europe a woman would have to be entirely naked in public to provoke charges ( [ ymmv ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ymmv ) ) . 
  that 's not the only country missing from the map . 
  see if you can find switzerland , norway , perhaps even russia , turkey , etc. 
  it does n't , i 'm just elaborating , 
  yes , the [ total area of agricultural land ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/fe/organic_area_of_total_arable_land_and_shares_of_main_arable_land_crops%2c_by_country%2c_2015_new.png ) http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/organic_farming_statistics, 
   a country that is n't part of the latter . 
  a country that does n't want to part of the latter . 
  yes , [ eurostat has our data as well . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/bb/total_organic_area_%28fully_converted_and_under_conversion%29%2c_by_country%2c_2010_and_2015_new.png ), 
  organic farming in ~ ~ europe ~ ~ the eu . 
   the important ( to me ) thing is that those are n't conscripts tossed into the meatgrinder yes , i can certainly see why !, 
  from my russian studies i understand the impact the afghanistan conflict had on society . 
  the various chechen conflicts were n't great either , but that was a different ball game . 
   grown up men who made a conscious choice to become mercenaries yes , that 's fair , but they only had to because of a certain leader 's decision to conduct his foreign policy that way . 
  it does n't look like a great deal for the soldiers that die or get hurt [ without state pensions , etc ] . 
  clearly , dead soldiers are bad for political careers everywhere . 
   how much of a choice they had , given the economy is also a big question , but that 's a question for another discussion . 
  yeah , on the surface the offers seems too good to reject for most russians . 
  it 's really not fair on the russian taxpayers though !, 
   pmc , even if paid by the government , are not regular army . 
  yes , but that 's not the point , if it 's backed by the russian state that makes it proxy forces . 
  it 's a pointless veil . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's wrong to fight for syria/assad , but the losses are russian in all but name . 
   was us government to blame for blackwater actions in middle east ? 
  yes . 
   no , i 'm talking about it as a thing , as a meme . 
  it would n't surprise me if they have adopted it , seeing as they 're so close with the russians . 
  is there a real difference ? 
  is n't it russian financed ? 
  [ it 's not that uncommon either ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9epx7bm.png ) heck , sweden is [ reintroducing ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39140100 ) it . 
  i think you have to want to see it ... 
  i found [ evidence ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/slavs_squatting/comments/3nb051/squatting_in_italy/ ) of [ serbs ] ( http://slavsquat.com/serbian-teaching-his-daughter-the-slav-way-in-the-90s/ ) also doing it ,
