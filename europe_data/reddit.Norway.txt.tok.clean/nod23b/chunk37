  yes , of course , all knowledge is valuable , but they did n't contain any life changing revelations of a deity . 
  they 're certainly important works , as literature , and the historical foundation for the culture i live in today . 
  busy ? 
  they 're mostly young men , rarely do they have families . 
  if they have jobs at all . 
  many of the extremists are criminals and have often spent time behind bars [ in prison ] . 
  they also supposedly become `` religious '' so it should be `` entertaining '' for them  for ordinary people on the other hand i agree . 
  it 's literally `` german '' as well , the teutons were a germanic tribe . 
  well , i 've read the major `` holy '' books ( translated and annotated ) . 
  it 's certainly available if you want to . 
  i found nothing of value . 
  the people in question simply do n't care to try . 
  they 're usually much more in love with the idea of them being god 's righteous warriors . 
  haha , that 's a good one . 
  it even says so on the glass xd, 
   ~ ~ a story of some hippy magician guy and ~ ~ the church wanting power ? 
   on the other hand , qur ` an is clear and all translations are open to read . 
  academic research on `` jihadis '' shows that even the muslims ( non-converts ) had very little knowledge about their religion 's actual teachings . 
  few of them had read the qur ` an or understood it . 
  they just listened to youtube videos or read diatribes extolling the virtues of murdering the enemy , etc. 
  in short , many muslims do n't know their own religion either . 
  hehe , that 's rather strange , it 's a norwegian made map as well . 
  yeah , i was a bit lazy with the first one . 
  * in vino veritas * . 
  kind of . 
  it 's `` vin '' , unlike most other germanic languages . 
  it 's close to the word for wine in icelandic ( v\u00edn ) and scandinavian ( vin ) . 
  boat , not ship . 
  the reddit title is wrong . 
  it 's called the stad ship tunnel for a reason . 
  it 's a good question . 
  norway is actually rising and has been since [ the last ice age ] ( http://folk.ntnu.no/vmbijmor/jmork/gearselection/00sicily/iceage.jpg ) . 
  norway is among [ the countries least effected ] ( http://energiogklima.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fig_67-nature.jpeg ) by long term sea level rise projections . 
  in the next 100 years norway is projected to experience [ minimal increases ] ( http://www.kartverket.no/globalassets/figur2.fw.png ) under three models . 
  they use eu money for that . . and [ norwegian money actually \\ ( eea \\ ) . 
  ] ( http://eeagrants.org/where-we-work/poland ), 
  ship ; a large boat for transporting people or goods by sea . 
  boat ; a small vessel for travelling over water , propelled by oars , sails , or an engine . 
   certainly not the first it will be the first * ship * tunnel , not just small boats or canal boats . 
  the title is wrong . 
  the title is misleading , because it 's actually called [ the stad ship tunnel . 
  ] ( http://www.kystverket.no/en/about-kystverket/stad-ship-tunnel-project/ ), 
  yes , that 's why it 's actually the first [ ship tunnel ] ( http://www.kystverket.no/en/about-kystverket/stad-ship-tunnel-project/ ) . 
  reddit got it wrong , who would have thought . 
  on the other hand they do n't have winters ... which certainly has an effect on our roads . 
  in certain cases , such as iraq and afghanistan , that 's the case . 
  on european security matters the members lead . 
  see [ the visegrad group ] ( http://www.visegradgroup.eu/about/cooperation/defence ) and their initiatives , and consequent nato troop deployment . 
   it 's just geography governing everything . 
  well , no , they actively chose to help . 
  they could just have remained on their side of the border . 
  yes , they were the only ones that had a choice due to the land border . 
  i would n't call it unclear . 
  sweden joined nato 's partnership for peace in 1994 and became a member of the euro-atlantic partnership council in 1997 . 
  if anything sweden is formally closer to nato today , but obviously not a member . 
  i think we can safely assume that there are oral agreements between the nordic , nato and european countries . 
  you 're very welcome  p.s. 
  legend has it that the suicide myth was created during the cold war by the americans in order to paint sweden in a bad light , since it was `` socialist '' and they were fighting communism . 
   if the germans ( the gdr ) were unable to implement communism , i ca n't imagine who would . 
  i suppose the communists would say that it was n't true communism . 
  i suppose the economics did n't work because they tried funding each other beyond reason . 
   what led norway to be a founding member ? 
  primarily , the loss of sovereignty . 
  nazi germany 's invasion and occupation revealed the apparent uselessness of being neutral . 
  the rules had changed . 
  furthermore , we saw a clear need to join together with our closest friends and allies ( the uk , us , europe ) for continued support . 
  as a small nation we could not hope to withstand the ussr or germany again . 
  especially , in light of the potential threat of communist invasion/insurrection . 
  our parliament , the norwegian labor party ( social-democrats ) , the armed forces and intelligence agency , all saw a need to defend the country against communism . 
  the west used nato for cooperation to prepare for conflict and prevent communist funded rebellions/revolutions . 
   is norway not happy about that ? 
  we 're pretty happy about that . 
  we view the us very positively in this context ( reliable partner ) . 
  which is why norway is always willing to support our allies when called for ( afghanistan , iraq , libya , syria , etc ) . 
  very few dissidents , but some on the left wing of politics . 
   without all the communism before and after wwii it was a different situation . 
  the labor party had ruled norway for a long time . 
  within that party there were divisions ; deep reds such as communists , marxists , m-ls , etc. 
  the norwegian communists were in communication with the ussr . 
  the ussr had lots of active agents here . 
  remember , after wwii the communists stood strong in many countries ; they looked good to many people . 
  they won the war , and people were looking for easy solutions and hope . 
  with some support from the ussr they could have taken the country further left , with or without violence . 
  maybe they could have won the popular vote even . 
  what , they did n't liberate * all * of norway , so they did n't liberate it at all ? 
  what kind of nonsense is that ? 
  the soviets helped liberate norway and it 's recognized as such by the norwegian state . 
  the allied nations fought to resist the invasion , but after that there was only one front . 
   suicide rates are high please , that old myth , do you even know the rates ? 
  they 're higher in the us than norway !, 
  eastern europe , asia and africa have the highest rates . 
  a country , but maybe not the same . 
  thailand is military dictatorship and has [ a muslim minority in the south that wants independence . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_thailand_insurgency ), 
   and their government is about to fall apart too that 's not an accurate description of a government considering leaving their offices because they want to take responsibility . 
  the sd is a bit different though , but it 's just a political party ... not the nazi party . 
   i mean , norway is a member norway is a founding member though , it would be a bit late to complain now . 
  norway was even liberated by the soviets . 
  over the last thousand years we 've never ever had a conflict with russia . 
  sweden and russia on the other hand have had many wars in the past ( empire building on both sides ) .
