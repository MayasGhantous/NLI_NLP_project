  now , i do n't think it matters , because russia is just worried about nato 's `` containment '' strategy . 
  they really do n't want sweden or finland to join nato because it would surround them with potential enemies . 
  they really do view the world differently . 
   there is a notion that if sweden gets attacked we would get aid anyway . 
  you already had secret treaties with nato during the cold war , so it was n't baseless or unspoken either , 
  it 's not really unusual though ? 
  you 've already taken part in cold response multiple times ? 
   applesin is the bomb * appelsin *, 
  at the time it was part of france itself . 
  `` from 1848 until independence , the whole mediterranean region of algeria was administered as an integral part of france . '', 
  what 's the story behind the name ? 
  in norwegian `` kvass '' means sharp . 
   it would be unthinkable to use a toothpick in public . 
  hmm , i think that 's an individual thing here , but most people would agree that it 's not really the done thing in norway either . 
  it 's like picking your nose or ear . 
  i suppose your company , age and setting matters ; you should n't at a formal dinner for example . 
  introduced in norway by an american company . 
  the recipe was was probably designed in the us . 
  it 's not norwegian because it 's sold here . 
  this has nothing to do with `` socialism '' . 
  the idea of `` injustice '' is present in humans by the time we 're toddlers , according to research . 
  by `` social attitudes '' he 's describing how polish people think and react to the perceived injustice . 
  their reaction to the price differences is what 's interesting , not why the prices are different . 
  that the price differences are caused by supply/demand is not at all clear . 
  there 's more to economics than such basic concepts , see [ price elasticity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/price_elasticity_of_demand ) and [ price discrimination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/price_discrimination ) for example . 
  well , with applied economic pressure they 'll realize the time ... 
   this will hurt inditex and h&m and others who profit from child labor in bangladesh as if they ca n't source from a number of other countries . 
  who are you fooling ? 
  i know a surprisingly high * percentage * of the czechs in norway !, 
  does it sound dirty in finnish ? 
   euros : quick to circlejerk the american equivalent must be `` quick to make accusations without evidence '' . 
  from iraq 's `` wmds '' to iran . 
   do you really want more countries developing these weapons ? 
  what a remarkably useless question , since that 's why we made the agreement and the non-proliferation agreements . 
  though we have to acknowledge that once pandora 's box has been opened it does n't go back in . 
   a bunch of countries with no way to back up a threat are never going to make this demand with any sort of credibility . 
  once they have nukes it 's hard , but we know that there are other ways to hurt them . 
  the sanctions take all the fun out of having those toys . 
  heck , libya gave them up because of it . 
  it seems more likely to resolve the issue . 
  they did come to the table because of that after all . 
  what iran wants most is to fix their economy , stabilize their own state , increase their power in the region and counter the sunnis . 
  now , if that runs counter to israel 's wishes , that 's not really europe 's problem . 
   neither side is really sticking to the deal what do you mean ? 
  the us just said iran is sticking to the deal . 
   finland is the only one with `` no data '' . 
  it 's one of the few eu members without data , but that 's not it either as i see ireland , slovenia , croatia and estonia are also missing data . 
   color northern norway ~ ~ and sweden ~ ~ mixed because of ~ ~ me\u00e4nkieli and ~ ~ sami . 
  it 's a tiny minority in norway . 
  they do n't even use it as their primary language . 
  coloring it in as `` mixed '' would be very misleading . 
  yes , i realized at the time , i 'm only joking , 
  if the meat 's cheap enough i 'm sure they will use it !, 
   fear of being served sorry , i do n't quite get that one . 
  oh , is that why my lasagna has a warning label : `` may contain traces of alcohol '' ? 
  nonsense , they have to buy them in bulk for that . 
  this place is obviously just selling pets irresponsibly ; for bum fights and pissing off the neighbors !, 
  i hope they at least neuter them before selling them !, 
  neuter your pets , people !, 
   `` cultural organizations '' that sell alcoholics and food i hope they sell alcoholic drinks or alcohol ( s ) , because `` alcoholics '' are people , man . 
  indeed . 
  yes , but our [ social-democratic/protestant ] culture predates oil money . 
  the oil fund is primarily used to save money , not spend it . 
  we finance our budget using sales and income taxes .

   the bottle automate [ the bottle recycling machine ] ( http://www.reversevending.co.uk/images/zws/ikea_edinburgh_%20minister_feb_21_2013.jpg ) for non-danes , 
  you win this thread !, 
  yeah , but you guys are an exception due to economic pressures and frankly abusive practices . 
  to be clear , the area [ taos pueblo ] was inhabited from around 3000 bc , but the remaining ruins are dated to about 900 ad . 
  prehistoric ; relating to or denoting the period before written records . 
  prehistory is the period of human activity between the use of the first stone tools ~ 3.3 million years ago and the invention of writing systems , the earliest of which appeared ~ 5300 years ago ( i.e. 
  around 3000 bc ) . 
   if you wanted to you could leave . 
  you remain a part because you want to . 
  ah , did you vote `` leave '' yourself ? 
   til : real politk doesnt exist . 
  sure , * realpolitik * exists . 
  it 's not a question of pragmatism . 
  it seems you 're seriously overestimating our ability to influence the eu . 
  our pm is currently a guest of merkel at the g20 summit . 
  we 're trying very hard to be best friends , but it does n't mean much . 
  the eu writes laws to suit their needs and views . 
  one recent example is the new offshore safety rules which are less strict than ours . 
  we dearly wish we had more influence on that . 
   in which case you can describe most of the eu members as being at the kiddies table . 
  they have votes , that matters for certain decisions . 
  the smaller nations are of course less powerful than the greater . 
   well he is . 
  you most certainly have a choice in the matter . 
  what choice ? 
  to leave ? 
  we want and need the market access , as most of our exports go to the eu . 
  we wo n't get access without paying as we do now , or becoming full members ( and paying ) . 
   you do have a say and likening it to the ` kiddies table ' is a disservice . 
  no , we have no say in how the eu is run or its legislation . 
  that is a fact . 
  we do sometimes get to provide * informal * input on new legislation , but we 're not party to the formal process . 
  i 'm not sure it 's a disservice to describe it as the kiddies table , we 're mostly ignored and sometimes listened to [ if they care to ] . 
  in norway we do [ something very similar .
