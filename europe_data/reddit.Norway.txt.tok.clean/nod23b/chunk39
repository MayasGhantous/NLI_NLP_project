  ` ya ' , but on an inhale instead of an exhale . 
  we do the same with `` ja '' . 
   federal europe european federation sounds better . 
  probably because at least norway is part of the eu 's inner market ( four freedoms ) and schengen . 
  he would be free to move and work anywhere in the eu . 
  he 's not wrong though . 
  we pay to take part in the eu 's market , but we do n't have a vote on how it 's run . 
   the states are like 500 years old so technically , `` the states '' are not , since 2017 - 1776 = 240 years . 
  founded by the spanish in 1565 st. augustine is the oldest european-founded city in the united states ( 452 years ago ) . 
  - the first successful english colony , jamestown , was established in 1607 on the james river in virginia ( 410 years ago ) . 
  - the spanish established a town in the new world in 1493 , present-day dominican republic , but that 's not the continental us . 
  they do have prehistoric ruins dating from 900 a.d. in new mexico and other states ( see pueblo indians , etc ) . 
  i wonder if urbanization matters . 
  sweden 's population is more urbanized . 
  yeah , it 's worse the further north you go though . 
  the far north of norway either gets no sun ( winter ) or all of the sun ( summer ) . 
  here in the south of norway it 's dark-ish , maybe just two hours some `` nights '' . 
  that has an effect on sleep patterns for sure !, 
  however , most people just enjoy the long nights with family and friends . 
  it 's quite noticeable nine months later ( ! ), 
  we have blackout curtains in the bedroom to keep the light out . 
  fair enough . 
  i just wanted to point out that europe should be even colder , but the gulf stream is what makes even remotely livable . 
  on a side note , i remember reading up on montana , after a distant relative visited some years ago . 
  i think he was a sheriff from billings . 
  we covered all of the us states in geography/history/english in school though , but it was extra interesting after meeting my relatives , 
  to be fair he was being a bit dramatic and rather exceptional . 
  we 're usually very happy with temperatures above 22 . 
  a good summer 's day is above 25 c . we enjoy going to southern europe and survive your temperatures just fine  it 's currently 25-30 c here in southern norway . 
  it 's quite nice by the sea , with a mild breeze . 
  everyone 's sitting outside , or boating , swimming , etc. 
  the nights are a bit too warm though . 
  air conditioning was rather unusual until recently , though we buy them for heating . 
  europe lies north of the us for the most part . 
  yes , to a degree , the scandinavia/nordic countries have very different experiences despite being in the same area . 
  it does n't really work that way within norway for example . 
  too much coast line and the sea cools things down , we have lots of inland variations , the far north gets great weather during summer , etc. 
  hehe , yeah , it was just from a phrase site  i usually speak english or russian with my colleagues . 
  my guys seem to make the best of it though . 
  `` hej '' is swedish/danish , not norwegian . 
  i did n't know that the day was n't popular for you guys . 
  you have no flag , but stalking you shows belarus . 
  it 's still a work day though as demonstrated by your own example . 
  most popular based on number of celebrants ? 
  public support ? 
  public festivities ? 
  christmas eve probably wins after new year 's eve . 
  in my own country constitution day probably wins over christmas . 
  you are n't legally entitled those without having a job . 
  if it 's similar to norway you have to have been employed for a full year before you 're entitled to paid vacation days . 
  no , i mean [ the common meaning is country . 
  ] ( https://dictionary.writtenchinese.com/worddetail/guo/162/1/2 ) the boxer rebellion of 1900 was defeated by the eight-nation alliance ( \u516b\u570b\u806f\u8ecd , * b\u0101gu\u00f3 li\u00e1nj\u016bn * ) of japan , russia , united kingdom , german empire , austria-hungary , france and the united states ( \u7f8e\u56fd ) . 
  the us and france were not kingdoms . 
  according to some here the name of france did n't get the * gu\u00f3 * part , as a mark of equality , until after the `` boxer protocol '' treaty ( 1901 ) . 
  if so france was n't even a kingdom (  1789 ) when the f\u0103gu\u00f3 ( \u6cd5\u56fd ) entered chinese . 
   i 'm pretty sure that the uk cares about as much about the opinions of a court without jurisdiction as anyone else does . 
  everyone else ? 
  [ you mean the us !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eqcysfl.png ) european nations voluntarily accept the court 's verdicts . 
  [ the uk amended it in 2017 ] ( https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/commons/2017-02-23/hcws489/ ) : `` the government has informed the un secretary-general of an amendment to the united kingdom 's optional clause declaration ( declaration ) accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the international court of justice ( court / icj ) . 
  the declaration accepts the jurisdiction of the court in contentious cases that come within its scope . '', 
  it does n't though ? 
  i believe guo means country , state or nation . 
  \u570b is composed of \u56d7 ( boundary ) and \u6216 ( \u6208 spear , \u53e3 mouth - people ) : land , people and weapons within a boundary . 
  well , it does n't sound much like it : https://forvo.com/word/%e6%b3%95%e5%9c%8b/#zh, 
  haha , are you kidding ? 
  do you even recognize my country 's flag ?!, 
  i do n't care what the eu pays . 
  i believe it 's actually doable if you use lng . 
  the us , canada and others are more than able to fulfill your needs in the future . 
  it just requires a lot more shipping . 
  [ the baltics are switching to lng supplies ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/lithuania-gas-idusl8n15n1uf ) from norway and the us now . 
  you could always import lng gas from the us as well . 
  russia is one of the eu 's largest suppliers of energy . 
  in 2016 , it accounted for ** 39 % ** of its natural gas imports . 
  28 % of oil . 
  norway is the world 's third largest exporter of oil and gas after saudi arabia and russia . 
  in 2016 , it accounted for about ** 34 % ** of all the eu 's natural gas imports and 12,6 % of its crude oil imports . 
  norway also produces a large amount of hydroelectric power which it will be possible to export to the eu in greater quantities if new grid connections are built . 
  - norway can increase output and has great reserves . 
  algeria ( 11,6 % ) , qatar ( 7,9 % ) and others can export more . 
  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/imports-and-secure-supplies/supplier-countries http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/eu_imports_of_energy_products_-_recent_developments#main_suppliers_of_natural_gas_and_petroleum_oils_to_the_eu, 
  we rejected them twice and we 're probably never going to give up our sovereignty . 
  it sure would . 
  however , i have to redirect your prayers to the actual eu members . 
  we can pray for them together :d, 
  yes , but those were before the eads mergers and the eu umbrella . 
  now , with the proper motivation ( external ) it could work better . 
  says the guy from martinique of all places , 
  specifically , tenerife . 
  the canary islands are great for active holidays ; water sports and hiking , 
  ha , more like $ 25 here ( not by law ) . 
  great video , great engineering !, 
  yes , i thought about mentioning it , but it was n't really important . 
  stig is n't stige after all . 
  my point remains , 
  here 's a video of people going down this road : - [ longboarding ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rrajodlcse ) - on a [ bicycle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8tp_wakvgg ) - base jumping in [ a wingsuit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkdwwuj_0oo ), 
  they 're not the same in norwegian either ; * sti * ( path ) and * stige * ( ladder ) . 
  you too , 
  did you shout `` holy macaroni '' when you saw it ?
