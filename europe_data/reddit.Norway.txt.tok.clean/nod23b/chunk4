  some more than others . 
  so normal governments , like in norway ? 
  i do n't think you know too much about the various parties ... 
  it 's entirely wrong to compare the progress party of norway with parties like the sweden democrats and true finns etc. 
  they 're just a normal libertarian-conservative party today . 
  sorry , but the norwegian party is not comparable with the rest . 
  it 's just a normal political party now and has been for many years . 
  itt : people with little to no knowledge about political parties in other countries . 
   countries are not defined by their ethnic groups . 
  that 's just it , some of us are . 
  you 're too focused on the fact that many or even most are multi-ethnic . 
   does n't so much apply to sweden and the sami ... but my general point still stands . 
  no , not really . 
  it 's not just the sami , it does n't apply to pakistanis in norway | sweden either . 
  our countries were founded as * nations * first and foremost , states for peoples ( ethnic group ) . 
  we 're not some random hodgepodge of peoples and city states like the netherlands or belgium . 
  cheeze_whiz_shampoo is pretty much spot on for us . 
   natural-born citizen of sweden . 
  sure , but being born does n't make you a citizen either ( jus sanguinis ) . 
  i 'm not sure you can dismiss the ethnic factor that easily either . 
  we define ourselves in more ways than one . 
  are you sure you know sweden | norway that well ? 
  we have two terms in my country , one for the ethnic group and yet another for citizens . 
  nordmann and norsk ( norwegian ) . 
  we fully embrace all of our citizens , but we 're also a nation based on an ethnic group . 
  the sami do n't belong to the [ norwegian ] ethnic group . 
  it 's something we recognize and respect by giving them their own parliament , language protection and other rights etc. 
  a sami ( ~ ~ laplander ~ ~ ) person would object to being called swedish ( ethnic ) . 
   it slipped into norwegian as a given name likely into danish first . 
  it 's common in sweden as well . 
   as far as i understand the situation , hans and johannes are two different names in norwegian , yes , of course . 
   and the biblical apostle is called johannes , not hans also correct . 
  welcome to the past ? 
  what 's the point of telling us about something that 's * not * unique to france ?!, 
  did any of your news items occur in france ? 
  let 's see ; not the eu deal ( brussels ) , not the isis files ( germany ) , and certainly not trump 's hands . 
  well , that 's not too bad , at least you managed 6/9 . 
   trump 's little hands , of course . 
  `` what happened in your country this week '' ? 
  haha , no , you stop right there !, 
  west coast norwegian is far from dano-norwegian , 
  i 'm sure your neighbors will love your characterization , 
  though , it 's more a mix of english and german in my opinion . 
   faroese language . 
  its really cool and it sound like some swedefied/norwegian icelandic faroese is just another west coast dialect of norwegian to me . 
  it was once one of our settlements and it shows . 
   south koreans have such easy access to foreign food ( including western food ) they still do n't have access to unique and local products from other countries . 
  you seem to be missing the point . 
   they eat lots of the same candy i grew up on the other side of the earth . 
  they also have plenty that you never did . 
  the same goes for all of us . 
  it 's what 's interesting about traveling and these videos . 
   there was very little opposition to the fuhrer [ there most certainly was opposition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_resistance_to_nazism ) and people died for it . 
  to dismiss it is disrespectful . 
   there was very little opposition to the fuhrer , he was a well liked guy hitler became powerful because people were looking for a way out of the misery . 
  someone to make ~ ~ america ~ ~ germany great again !, 
   the smell of the sickly and dead would not have escaped the german nose . 
  yes , they knew about the camps , but the smell ? 
  if they had camps in every city and town , but they did n't . 
  they were n't called concentration camps for nothing . 
   the french were definitely the best the same applies to africa . 
  they gave their subjects rights as citizens . 
  it was imperialism , but at least they were guided by post-revolutionary ideals and ideas . 
   boat river bay . 
  very precise . 
  i like it !, 
  `` you started it ! '', 
   norwegians understand about 80 % of swedish though , due to being viking buddies . 
  more like  90 % . 
  swedes understand less of norwegian in general . 
  here in scandinavia we celebrate [ midsummer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_john%27s_eve#scandinavia ) ( jonsok ) under the name [ saint 's john eve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_john%27s_eve#scandinavia ) ( sankt hans aften ) . 
  [ saint olaf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olaf_ii_of_norway ) , was a norwegian king ( 1015-1028 ) . 
  you might know him as \u00d3l\u00e1fr haraldsson , \u00d3l\u00e1fr hinn helgi or \u00d3lafur digri [ from the sagas ( icelandic link ) . 
  ] ( https://is.wikipedia.org/wiki/helgisaga_%c3%93lafs_haraldssonar ), 
  what ? 
  christianity was brought by a few priests and our populations * converted * [ or were killed ] . 
  we were all catholics ... 
  really ? 
  nothing to do with sankt hans ( midsummer ) or olav ? 
  the traditional bonfire and partying makes places like * sankthansberget * very un-christian in my opinion . 
  we were all catholics in scandinavia as well ... once . 
  old place names would still exist . 
   later on bought by swedes and made into international brand . 
  i wonder why . 
  this is typical for telecoms regardless of country and company . 
  telia has bought companies in norway as well and rebranded them . 
  now they 're changing the name to telia here as well . 
  norway 's telenor does the same and is present in countries such as sweden , denmark , serbia/montenegro , india and pakistan etc. 
  the world 's sixth or seventh largest telecoms company i believe . 
  an even better point , hehe . 
  yeah , i expect as much , it 's pretty standard for telia to roll out early testbeds , 
  why ? 
  because of ireland ? 
  it 's more amusing when if you 've seen their tabloid media complaining about the `` invasion '' of bulgarians/romanians . 
  an invasion that never happened btw . 
  it 's `` them '' i 'm referring to . 
  make your minds up !, 
  you 've just decided to vote on kicking them out , 
  you could just let sweden invade you ... 
  brought to you by sweden 's teliasonera group which owns the companies mentioned ( [ omnitel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omnitel ) / [ teo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teo_lt ) ) .
