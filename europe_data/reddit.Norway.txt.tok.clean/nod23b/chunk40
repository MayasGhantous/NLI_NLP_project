  rather them than us !, 
   i just want to clarify one thing . 
  we mostly speak ukrainian , not russian :-) anyway , thank you very much for your comment !, 
  yes , i know  he was from lviv and spoke polish , ukrainian and russian . 
  i had some russian in school . 
  it was the only language the guy and i had in common , 
  hehe , i just meant we were at the heart of europe , but nato is a good point as well , 
  thanks , very interesting !, 
  reminds me of markets i 've visited in serbia , istanbul , and asian countries . 
  by chance i had a ukrainian guy working on my house today ; my russian is n't great , but neither was his german . 
  no english . 
  we did manage to talk though . 
  i do n't disagree , just pointing out that the important information is on the left , 
  though there is [ more to be said . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hv97k/vehicle_registration_plates_of_europe/dj1lndc/ ), 
  what it does n't show is that [ the symbol ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/king_of_mann_%28coat_of_arms%2c_armorial_wijnbergen%29.jpg ) comes from the period when isle of man ( n ) was part of the [ norwegian ] [ kingdom of the isles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_isles ) . 
  in `` a brief history of the isle of man '' it 's claimed : `` the rebellion { of 1275 } was , however , abortive and resulted in some members of the royal family emigrating to norway , where their descendants are still to be found in the norwegian family of skankes , ... 
  the emigrants took with them as their arms `` the three legs '' , which had been the royal arms of the sudreyan \\* kings since about the middle of the 13th century . 
  these arms ( a modification of the ** ancient indo-germanic sun symbol ** ) were simplified in norway and sweden to one leg and in denmark to three bare feet , and later to one bare foot '' -- the schanke family name comes from a tribe of the ancient scottish-english border region . 
  schanke is a name for a person with long legs , or a peculiar manner of gait . 
  schanke is a nickname , and can refer directly or indirectly to one 's personality , physical attributes , mannerisms , or even their habits of dress . 
  - it derives from the old english word * sceanca * , which means shin bone , or leg . 
  while this word has survived in scotland it has been replaced in england , by the old norse word * leggr * , which means leg . 
  \\* sudreyan : * the kingdom of the isles comprised the hebrides , the islands of the firth of clyde and the isle of man from the 9th to the 13th centuries ad . 
  the islands were known to the norse as [ the su\u00f0reyjar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/kingdom_of_mann_and_the_isles-en.svg/975px-kingdom_of_mann_and_the_isles-en.svg.png ) , or `` southern isles '' as distinct from the nor\u00f0reyjar or northern isles of orkney and shetland . 
  the number on the right is for the region ( 77 = moscow ) . 
  it does n't matter much i think . 
  yes , that 's correct . 
  the european flag is correct , it 's not the eu 's . 
  it was made for the [ council of europe \\ ( coe \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) . 
  incidentally , the secretary general of the coe is from norway . 
  i would n't mind if they sent some of that our way though .

  i would n't mind if they sent some of that our way though . 
  i 've driven a bit in mainland spain [ and several of their islands ] over the last decades ; it 's easy for the most part , lots of nice roads . 
  i 've usually been there around the high season as well . 
  obviously , you will encounter heavy traffic in/out of the cities during rush hour , etc. 
  reminds me of civilization ; not bothering to upgrade all of your units/cities . 
  reminds me of civilization ; not bothering to upgrade all of your units/cities . 
  nah , it would n't bother norwegians . 
  we 're more in competition with sweden than denmark . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  it 's the opposite in some cases , sometimes your p.c. 
  politics spills over into our papers . 
  some nutcase will attack us in an article for waving flags or daring to talk about immigration problems . 
  it 's annoying to suffer fools , but hardly something i hate sweden over , 
  hehe , it 's not really * that * bad though . 
  i could live in any of the scandinavian countries , but not in all of the nordic ; i probably would n't want to live in iceland or finland due to the language barrier . 
  the faroese are actually easy to understand . 
   t.european hmm , what 's that supposed to be ? 
  indeed  hehe, 
  that was sort of my point !, 
  :d a straight line on a map , will result in many more kilometers in reality . 
  shows how little you know , 
   their national day celebrates their independence from denmark no , we celebrate our constitution ; which was created after denmark-norway lost to sweden and allies . 
  however it was fought for under sweden . 
  sweden and denmark do n't really play a role in our celebrations . 
   if it just did n't lose norway on the other hand we controlled iceland , greenland , the faroes , shetland , orkney , the hebrides , isle of man , parts of scotland , england ( east coast ) and ireland . 
  now , if we had n't fallen under denmark ... ah , what if 's !, 
  can you blame them ? 
  i mean swiss/swede , chechnya/czechia , etc. 
  was that before * hygge * and * broen * became popular ? 
  i 've driven longer than that inside my own country ( in a straight line ) . 
  especially , considering the mountains/valleys , rivers and fjords you sometimes have to pass . 
  distances are more than air miles  i think op missed that . 
  that depends on whom/how you ask !, 
  culturally ? 
  religiously ? 
  ethnically ? 
  geographically ? 
  it 's great to see europe coming together !, 
  lithuania did this for georgia as well , if i remember correctly ? 
  i * literally * included my point at the very end , but i guess you ca n't read very well . 
  it 's a reply to your spurious question . 
  i described the world and how [ some ] muslim countries actually deal with this offense . 
  your hyperbole about the death penalty required a response . 
  as i wrote in my comment , they do n't even punish women in iran that harshly for the head covering ; just a talking to these days . 
  how on earth you arrived at `` is not being bad '' based on that is beyond me . 
  you must be smoking some strong stuff , but you are from amsterdam after all . 
  i guess you 're also a dick , but unfortunately we ca n't blame weed for that . 
  they do n't stone them to death for this in iran or saudi arabia . 
  i do n't think even isis does kills them , for the first offense . 
  the religious police does harass and sometimes arrest women in iran . 
  i assume the same in saudi arabia . 
  the point being that dup might support head covering , but the penalties might be rather mild . 
  we already pay a substantial amount to the eu . 
  oil & gas accounted for 11 % of the norwegian state 's revenue in 2016 . 
  it represented 24 % of our gdp in 2015 . 
   mainly because norway is both small and wealthy ironically , we 're bigger than germany , and much bigger than the uk in terms of area . 
   we were ruled 438 years by denmark . 
  that 's not entirely accurate , we did join that union voluntarily . 
  only later did we become a province of denmark . 
   we were ruled 91 years by sweden . 
  we had the * same * king . 
  there were two * separate * governments , even though it was controlled from stockholm at first . 
   because they were in ww2 and had become independent a generation before ww2 . 
  became independent * again * , as you know, 
   you ca n't judge us from you 're safe continent . 
  which is why we have ambassadors , our own correspondents , ngos , israeli and palestinian sources . 
  your comment seems very strange to me , it 's as if you think we sit here and judge from afar !,
