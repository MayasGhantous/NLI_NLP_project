  a balance between care and choice is the best of both worlds . 
  that aspect we agree on partially . 
  i believe in freedom with responsibilities . 
  your rights end where mine begin . 
  i 'm of course referring to fake news and faux news , etc. 
  when corporations became `` citizens '' people 's freedom of speech suffered . 
  it 's shocking that american broadcasters are no longer required to speak the truth . 
  net neutrality is dying in the us . 
  ideas can be corrupted if you repeat the same lies enough . 
  there are many good american ideas , but the idea that the `` government '' is a problem is a strange one to me . 
  i identify with my country 's government , it 's literally we the people . 
  this varies of course from country to country and over time . 
  perhaps the us is too big and varied to feel the same connection with its [ remote ] leaders . 
   ideas ( free speech ) ca n't . 
  i 'm not so sure any longer . 
   besides voting , how do you interact with policy makers ? 
  through my political party at various levels ? 
  people here are engaged in political parties and voluntary organizations of all kinds . 
  from the red cross , kiwanis , lions to the local sports clubs . 
  the state is required to have all affected parties have their written say when a law is proposed , etc. 
   is it honestly absurd to think politicians can have other ulterior motives to working for the best interest of their people ? 
  that depends on where you 're from ? 
  politicians are n't all made of the same stuff . 
  most of my country 's representatives are more likely to be rather ordinary citizens and not millionaires/billionaires . 
  we have a high degree of trust in my country , between citizens , and between the people and our government . 
  there 's a rather low threshold , it 's a place where most government officials live normal lives . 
  the king 's children attend public schools , etc. 
  we 're also supposedly ranked as the most democratic country in the world at the moment . 
   yes , even dumb stuff like this should be protected . 
  i agree , to a degree . 
  freedom of speech does n't have just one definition , the us definition for example is n't ours . 
  we feel some limits are required to protect other 's rights . 
   i 'm surprised people are so willing to let the government decide what should be allowed to be said . 
  some nations actually feel the state is us , and that the government is not an evil , alien entity . 
  the moment they put up ads from google ? 
  they 're great i tell you !, 
  we have the best tornadoes !, 
  it seems google suggests he should try translating it from `` polish '' ( pools ) , and suggests pronouncing it using arabic underneath . 
  the gentler , more civilized eurotornado , 
   so i dunno , seems more likely that they just happened to spell it with '' \u00f6 '' in modern times , but it never had anything to do with darkness . 
  there 's also old norse m\u01ebrk , the plural of mark , it seems ? 
  with various forms : m\u01ebrk , merkr , m\u00f6rk , markar . 
  for example there 's [ vingulm\u00f6rk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vingulmark ) / vingulm\u01ebrk / vingulmark , an area in norway , or the [ danm\u00f6rk / danm\u01ebrk ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/danm%c7%abrk ) ( denmark ) . 
  yeah , but often with french connections , 
  yes , we [ scandinavians ] all have \u00f8demark / \u00f6demark . 
  can confirm '' \u00f8demark '' and '' \u00f8delagt '' . 
  ah , i think you missed the context , that was part of a sentence describing the citizenry . 
  we , the citizens , are all equal . 
  the king works better as a figurehead , because he 's not a politician . 
  he 's not allowed to speak on political matters and does n't . 
  he 's a representative for the entire country . 
  we all see him as a grandfather of the country , not as a ruler . 
  the people continue to support him by voting against republican suggestions . 
  the monarchy is firmly supported and opposed every session of parliament . 
  there 's no reason to claim it was granted by his hierarchy . 
  we do n't have nobility . 
  as i mentioned it was granted by the people originally , but some time ago now . 
  it 's not equality for that one person , but presidents are also above the rest . 
  the people however have full freedom and equality , more than in most countries ( according to the un , oecd , other rankings ) . 
  according to those int ' l rankings we 're the world 's most democratic country , the happiest and with complete press freedom . 
  yep , i like to keep track of our purchases and investment strategy , on a hobby basis , 
  yes , the [ gulf stream and the rocky mountains airflow  ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-simulations-question-gulf-stream-role-tempering-europes-winters/ ) [ north america 's rocky mountains affect norway 's climate ] ( https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120906074029.htm ), 
   e.g. 
  here 's an example , where they bought a majority stake in the company owning the freehold of some of the prime properties on regent street yes , i was referring to regent street , but you missed the vital point : `` in an agreement that will be announced today , norges bank investment management will acquire a 25pc share in regent street , valuing the london estate at around # 1.8 bn . '', 
  `` norway 's stake will be held through a ** 150-year lease ** , while the crown estate , which manages property owned by the queen , will maintain management of regent street and ** retain ** the freehold . '', 
  i do n't think so , it 's a british term to begin with ( soccer = = association football ) . 
  yep , that 's right . 
  i do n't live there , but i lived somewhere similar . 
  you 're sure to find the following : - tourism/hospitality ( cruises , hotels , restaurants , guides , whale watching safaris , mountaineering ) - fishing ( commercial and visitors ) - technical maintenance of ships , mechanics , electricians , etc - municipal jobs ( schools , hospitals , common services ) - builders , accountants , whatever rents vary , but i paid around 8000-10000 nok/month for a house . 
  it can be even more expensive , and possibly a lot cheaper if you find the right/small apartment . 
  something something gulf stream , rocky mountains airflow , last ice age, 
   oh , and our pension fund keeps buying up half of london . 
  or at least the leases , not the property itself . 
  it works to a degree . 
  the youth has leave for the bigger cities in order to study , but many young men do n't and stay in the small villages/towns . 
  they find work there , but not women . 
  the women may return later in life with their families . 
  sorry , but that finnish guys forgot something important about norway . 
  we 're a mountainous country and have lots of rivers , fjords and lakes . 
  you literally ca n't drive across norway . 
  we build tons of tunnels , but driving will still take many hours . 
  driving across the country takes days , while it 's only a short flight . 
  he 's comparing apples and oranges . 
   this has led the norwegian road network into total disarray , and people find it less of a hassle to just fly domestically than to drive . 
  uh , * mountains * , norway has lots of them . 
  yes , there 's that point , but we do n't give them money directly . 
  the properties are owned by the state , we pay for that upkeep and official representation ( state visits ) . 
  we do pay them a generous salary , but presidents also receive that . 
  as for the cost , our office of public finance has calculated that a presidency would be more expensive than the current system . 
  they were n't bound by any loyalties . 
  we have plenty of republicans in parliament . 
  you 're mixing how one becomes head of state and their status . 
  obviously , the current king was n't elected , curiously his grandfather was approved in a national referendum . 
  presidents are elected in a number of ways , not always by popular elections , some are just elected by parliament . 
  more democratic , but not by much . 
  i really do n't think you know his status , as you are unlikely to know my country 's laws . 
  i 've studied law here ; i know my constitution and the king 's role and personal privileges . 
  he 's not a common citizen , but it 's no more than a president would have . 
  i guess you 're talking about the gmt change ? 
  i saw they held meetings around the country about the work hours/siesta ?
