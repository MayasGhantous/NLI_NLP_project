  they had posters and so on . 
  hehe , thanks , i did n't know he had that title !, 
  yeah , at least possibly , she 's quite familiar in norway . 
  she 's family , just like the swedish royal family is . 
  hmm , scania , do n't you already have a queen ? 
   he 's also heck of a lot more noteworthy than say - the king of denmark . 
  you mean that ** dead ** man that preceded their current queen ?!, 
  :d p.s. 
  i know who you mean , but he 's a * prince * , [ a consort to the queen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henrik,_prince_consort_of_denmark ) . 
  similar to how [ camilla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camilla,_duchess_of_cornwall ) will never be a full queen in the uk . 
   denying the equality of the citizens of a region . 
  in theory , not in practice . 
  the king is legally seen as one step above , and he 's treated differently . 
  that 's typical of presidents as well ( see legal immunity , honorific titles ) . 
  now , in practice his `` highness '' does n't matter in any way to the citizenry ; * we 're * all equal . 
   i think that most people think that the monarchy is a bit outdated the absolute monarchy is , but the figurehead works well . 
  it 's better than a political office because at least the king is apolitical . 
  there 's even long-term continuity . 
  did n't you guys have a movement to change that ? 
  to remove the siesta and change the work/study and sleep pattern . 
  did someone also suggest changing the timezone ( gmt ) to correctly match your geographic location ? 
  hehe , yeah , by comparison with their numbers in other countries ofc , 
  they 're not that unusual in denmark proper . 
  many young people from greenland study in denmark for example . 
  i do n't think you know how expensive it is here !, 
  we pay * several * times that amount . 
  that 's the joke , 
  i you do n't have to doubt it at all , you can read about this  americans and other english speakers have no problem living their entire lives in the netherlands ( or scandinavia ) without speaking dutch . 
  it just makes getting jobs a bit difficult , and reduces your social interactions . 
  because even if we all speak english , we do n't use it in private . 
  seems cheap to me !, 
   why , man , why ? 
  lol if it sounds like you do n't speak the language ( dutch ) perfectly , people will * immediately * switch to the `` universal '' language ( english ) . 
  this will happen everywhere from the local supermarket to the bus driver . 
  you wo n't get to practice your dutch much . 
  this is quite typical for the netherlands [ and the nordic countries ] , countries where english is practically a second language . 
   if i hear someone speaking portuguese ( brazilian here ) i would n't switch to a foreign language i also happen to speak ... that 's a completely different scenario . 
   even if my dutch is better than my english ? 
  ; - ) some of my foreign friends have had more luck pretending not to speak english , or insisting that their friends use their language . 
  friends , once you have them , are one thing , but everyone else wo n't be as patient . 
  you 'll struggle to speak it , because everyone will switch to english the instant they hear your accent , 
  sounds like a plan , where can i buy tickets ? 
  hey , they just had [ their first * surplus * since 1995 !, 
  ] ( http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1227266/2016-marks-best-primary-budget-surplus-figure-in-greece-since-1995 ) `` greece on friday announced its highest annual primary budget surplus since 1995 , ... of 3.9 percent of gpd , or 6.937 billion euros in absolute terms . '', 
  71 times in 24 hours ? 
  far outside the normal patrol frequency !, 
  i do n't think it 's `` training '' , but other words spring to mind . 
  it certainly has nothing to do with political tensions between turkey and the eu/greece . 
  a waste of greek and turkish money though . 
  hey , we were the original settlers of iceland and the faroes , and settled in ireland , scotland including the islands , northwest england and isle of man !, 
  well , it 's not that bad for a * foreigner * ( non-european ) . 
  nah , we 're good , i 'd be happy with this new state , 
  it sure got cold up here !, 
  i think i 'll fly south and vacation in svalbard !, 
  yeah , i did n't want to write a full dissertation on the subject  there has been lots of research and speculation . 
  here 's one paper : - the average number of nucleotide substitutions from the mtdna [ * see maternal * ] haplotype data indicated that the finnish saami may be closer to the finns than to the other reference populations - whereas [ nuclear dna ] ( http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xcsh2hns1hk/vvrd82qk1zi/aaaaaaaadxs/gnh6yroj2no/image_thumb%25255b4%25255d.png?imgmax=800 ) suggested that the finns are more closely related to the european reference populations than to the finnish saami https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1915079/ -- the new university of helsinki analysed almost 250,000 snps from a total of 945 samples from eastern and western finland , sweden , northern germany and great britain . 
  it confirms previous hypotheses that finland -- which is both geographically and linguistically isolated from other parts of europe -- is genetically isolated as well . 
  - `` the germans and british were less differentiated than the swedes , western finns and especially the eastern finns who also showed other signs of genetic drift '' http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003519, 
  he 's probably just joking . 
   danish names over swedish landscapes . 
  we love this kind of humor !, 
  we 're like brothers that poke fun at each other . 
  op clearly knows his stuff , 
  i enjoyed this one !, 
  xd as a `` stuck up swede '' !, 
   sami people - considered as scandinavian or at least - nordic ? 
  they 're nordic . 
  the sami are ethnically distinct and were entirely unrelated to the germanic scandinavian peoples . 
  however , over time they 've mixed . 
  to outsiders they mostly look like typical white europeans . 
  certain facial features strike me as `` sami '' though . 
  - the finns are closer to the sami in terms of dna , according to research . 
  their populations mixed more in general . 
  the sami migrated in from what 's russia today . 
  you already have : http://tr.euronews.com/, 
  how long before someone notices and * thinks * you have a typo in teutscher ? 
  i look forward to the day we start undoing humanity 's impact on our planet . 
  please , note that this is a reference to a book . 
   i think king cnut is just as famous and legendary he was danish . 
   harald bluetooth he was danish , barely ruled over norway ( time/area ) . 
   in that traditional split neutral countries like the nordic countries and yugoslavia count as east wtf ? 
  no , they were n't . 
  we 're even founding nato members ( denmark/norway ) and part of the allies during wwii . 
  sweden and finland were neutral , but western aligned . 
  heck , we had secret nato defense agreements with them . 
  it 's missing svalbard though . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyppas6zdi ), 
   the question is : if these would be muslims wearing the very same clothes , doing the very same things : would it make a difference ? 
  do n't you see that they 're carrying weapons ( hammer , knife ) and torture devices ?!, 
  xd they 're clearly terrorists . 
  but only if you 're christian , which will really make it acceptable to everyone !, 
  definitive proof hungarian politics are of another world ? 
  that does n't make much more sense ? 
  finland did n't belong to the east . 
  it was simply neutral and part of [ the nordic council . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council ), 
  oh , really ? 
  i did n't know , but now that you mention it , i see why . 
  infamous is more like it . 
  olav v and haakon vii were good kings , but hardly comparable .
