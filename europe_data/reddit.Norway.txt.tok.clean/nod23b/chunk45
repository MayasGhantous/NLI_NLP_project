  harald hardr\u00e5de is clearly more famous and legendary !, 
  - he unsuccessfully claimed the english throne in 1066 , [ his defeat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harald_hardrada#invasion_of_england ) aided william the conqueror take england !, 
  - he was a commander of the byzantine [ varangian guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varangian_guard ) in constantinople - he lived in and fought for [ kievan rus ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kievan_rus%27 ) ( proto-russia ) - harald fought in the [ battle of stiklestad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_stiklestad ), 
  yes , of course , that 's a good point . 
  hehe , so there are * two * nations in europe that call the germans saxons !, 
  finland and scotland . 
   cameron , may , farage or boris yes , i have the same impression . 
  i just do n't think the average person knows or cares that much about cameron or british politicians . 
   not that trump is any better , but he is entertaining . 
  watching the us has more than ever the feeling of watching a comedy show . 
  unfortunately . 
   germany in general has a tendency to discuss us politics a lot . 
  i think that applies to us all , all countries of the world . 
  thanks to your wording , in my mind , you ate him :d, 
  hehe , terribly sorry , master !, 
   she 's liked well enough by most germans i meant in the sense that she 's not universally loved , but that 's also part of my point . 
  she does n't have to be , to be an effective leader . 
  you ca n't please everyone , especially when your target is stability . 
  on the other hand , i 've seen various polls over the years , her approval rating goes up and down . 
   she 's got the nickname `` mutti '' yes , german was practically obligatory when i went to school  now , her nickname is n't entirely positive though , there are those who use it sarcastically . 
  i believe you skipped that part , 
  yes , exactly !, 
  yes , perhaps , but i believe people answer based on their general views on the country . 
  after all do you expect germans to know or care much about may or cameron ? 
  trump is more visible though . 
   i am just saying that zeman , trump and putin are close to being equally bad ok , i see your point , but you did literally say they are all the same , 
  yes , but i doubt they 'll pleased either way . 
  especially , if it leads to chaos . 
  i do n't know why you 're amused . 
  it 's the general international view and what matters . 
  she 's not very well liked or principled , but she does n't rock the boat . 
   the us decided to rebuild germany instead of looting and siphoning away all the resources like the soviets you have a few good books to read ... 
  i wonder if `` distance '' would be a factor as well . 
  it 's a well known fact that we trust those we feel closer to more . 
  fear of the foreign and distant is well documented . 
  understanding the culture and language helps as well , english and french are easier to access [ for germans ] . 
  based on that i think turkey might score lower than the uk regardless , simply because of that kind of literal and figurative distance . 
  i love you both !, 
  premier league * and * bach for me , 
  that 's for the leadership to care about though . 
  it 's not as if the people on either side are likely to appreciate the outcome . 
   inselaffen ( island monkeys ) which makes the danish expression for norwegians seem very fitting : `` mountain monkeys '' ( * fjellaber * ) xd, 
   well , at least in democratic countries . 
  uh , well , let 's not take that too far  hungary , turkey and the us did elect their leaders . 
   they are all made of the same crap i 'm sorry , but that 's just not true . 
  i do n't know everyone , but i do know leaders from my own region though . 
  they 're as far from trump/putin as you can get . 
  it 's something i 'm very happy to admit : i will happily accept my country 's future leader regardless of political party . 
  they 're generally a stable lot , and wo n't mess with things too much . 
  they 're certainly not in it for the money !, 
  they 're usually perfectly normal people with an education and some experience . 
  once they 're done in office they go on to the un , imf or norwegian politics . 
  they live in perfectly normal houses with their families . 
  [ here 's an example \\ ( youtube \\ ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17mx9omvc-e ), 
   not because of some admiration of a particular person . 
  i have to disagree , merkel is * part * of that trust . 
  she 's a dependable leader . 
  idiots believe ~ ~ they can trust ~ ~ him . 
  ftfy, 
  hmm , `` trust '' might be different from `` like '' though ? 
  the germans actually do like the british/english a lot , from what i understand . 
   no he does not . 
  norway and svalbard is the same colour and there is no capital marked on svalbard . 
  hmm , yes , that 's a good point , but the name is written in all upper-case . 
  sub-national divisions are usually written in lower-case , just like he did with the seas . 
  it 's a strange mix if you ask me , but at least he did n't assign it a capital !, 
  it 's ironic today , the world 's tallest people ... 
  yes , that does n't cover it , that was symbolic . 
  i believe they have to perform the seabed analysis to prove it 's an extension of their continental shelf or something similar . 
  here 's an article in the new york times about it : https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/world/europe/russia-to-present-revised-claim-of-arctic-territory-to-the-united-nations.html, 
  what 's the source ? 
  the norwegian sea is misspelled . 
  it seems the creator believes svalbard is a separate country . 
  russia claims it , but that * does n't * mean it 's theirs in any sense . 
  yet . 
  other countries have to recognize it and they have to prove it [ to qualify under existing int ' l laws ] . 
   atheism just means without belief in god sorry , but you have to qualify it : - gnostic atheist : believes that there are no gods and that it is * possible * to know this . 
  - agnostic atheist : believes that there are no gods and that it is * impossible * to know this . 
   daesh 's theology is a bastard brother of saudi wahhabbism . 
  sorry , but i disagree , it 's not a `` bastard brother '' . 
  if you meant they 're bastards , that we can agree on . 
  in the context of family `` bastard '' makes it appear less related . 
  i put the blame * squarely * on wahhabism . 
  daesh is a true son of that hateful family !, 
  daesh is derogatory when used as a word , while `` daesh '' makes it look like the acronym it is ( ad-dawlah al-isl\u0101miyah f\u012b ` l-\u02bfir\u0101q wa-sh-sh\u0101m ) . 
  yes , i skipped the saturday , it was just neater the way i wrote it  it 's not terrible , i 'm quite happy with our policies ( closed on sunday ) . 
  thanks , please do !, 
   with the exceptions being stores with alcohol what ? 
  not in my country at least !, 
  we have a public alcohol retail monopoly . 
  they 're never open on sundays , and barely open on saturdays . 
  that 's an improvement over the previous decades . 
  the only exception is specially designated , tiny supermarkets , where allowed by the municipality . 
  alcohol is not sold regardless . 
  stores are all closed on sundays here , with very few exceptions . 
  they close earlier than weekdays on saturday . 
  we all have pretty strict rules regarding alcohol sales . 
  they 're closed as well ( friday-monday ) . 
  edit : possibly open on saturday morning-afternoon .
