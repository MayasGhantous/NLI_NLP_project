  nah , we have a quick procedure for groundless applications now . 
  we even send people straight back to russia now . 
  `` just turn your bicycle around ! '', 
  you forgot pakistanis and north africans . 
  i really , really do n't know :( we did buy your [ cv90s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combat_vehicle_90 ) though , however that [ archer artillery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archer_artillery_system ) of yours is apparently not good enough . 
  nato treaty article 5 is always an option for denmark and norway . 
  on the other hand they do n't have to invoke that to make us act as allies ( or whatever we are ) . 
   finland 's nazi `` collaboration '' ... that 's one way of looking at it ? 
  it 's not , it 's fairly normal . 
  it does show that the bonds exists and beyond nato 's article 5 requests . 
  sweden and finland are not in nato though . 
  what 's worse is that they bought their latest fighters from the us . 
  they got slightly better control and access to their f-35 's software and technology than others ( see norway ) . 
  they also assemble [ their own apache versions etc. 
  relevant : [ britain leads 7-state joint expeditionary force , mobilizing 10,000 troops ] ( https://www.rt.com/uk/324030-fallon-joint-expeditionary-force/ ) britain will play a leading role in a new joint expeditionary force ( jef ) including troops from denmark , estonia , latvia , lithuania , the netherlands and norway , which could be in a position to mobilize 10,000 soldiers . 
  [ sweden considers joining uk-led joint expeditionary force ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/policy/2015/10/04/sweden-considers-joining-uk-led-joint-expeditionary-force/72746418/ ), 
  you do realize norway 's part of the eea ( eu ) ? 
  we are keenly aware of the swiss experiences . 
  it 's been part of our debates for the last decade or more . 
  `` fog in channel , continent cut off ! '', 
  are you kidding ? 
  if there 's one thing we cherish it 's our christmas traditions . 
  even though the tree is a rather recent german invention , 
  ok , i see your point , 
  i believe your point was the winter range ? 
  it 's reduced by 20 % . 
  would it be different for the others ? 
   you do not have that range at colder temperatures you actually do get that kind of range ( ~ 400 km ) . 
  [ see the experience of norwegian tesla owners here .

  [ this photo makes it a bit clearer ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/arctic_cathedral.jpg ) that the cross is separate from that bar . 
  the church is called * ishavskatedralen * , literally `` the cathedral of the arctic sea '' , but it 's formally known as tromsdalen/troms \u00f8ysund church . 
  it 's politics ; compromise is necessary . 
  the liberals ' immigration policy is n't that popular with the general population . 
  their marginal status is evidence enough . 
  since you deleted your comment i 'll reply here . 
  thanks for clarifying that you meant the others . 
  interestingly , the nordic countries have had a [ passport free ] zone for travel , work and residency since 1951 . 
   this was n't what the internet was supposed to be like :( according to whom/what ? 
  you make it sound as though the ethos was somehow defined from the very beginning . 
  putting the ottoman back into turkey more like it . 
  they 're a perfect match for the eu . 
  ironically , they 're probably the most pro-immigrant party . 
  while the liberals ( v ) are the most pro- * immigration * . 
   now they 're asking for the same who are you referring to ? 
  do you mean the uk ? 
  norway 's not asking for a two-speed europe , as we 're not in the eu . 
  that was a very odd episode indeed , not really sound empirical data for a conclusion . 
  i 've flown with norwegian , sas and ryanair many times myself . 
  if they actually flew to those countries ... 
  i 'm not sure if you 're joking or not ? 
  they did n't forget them as they just do n't fly to those destinations . 
  uh , have you ever flown with norwegian ? 
  they 're * not * ryanair . 
  the scandinavian languages ought to be a buy-one-get-three deal !, 
  it 's very cool , but brazil and portugal have coordinated their language reforms . 
  the other lusophones nations follow brazil 's lead . 
  yes and ironically spain has very significant regional languages like catalan and basque . 
  there 's a iso code for latin american spanish , but no flag . 
  that would n't make much sense either since they 're reforming their language to fit the brazilian spelling ( i.e. 
  like it 's spoken ) . 
   brazilian portuguese , not european portuguese . 
  the lusophone world is uniting . 
  portugal actually agreed to `` follow '' the brazilians recently . 
  the portuguese language orthographic agreement was signed in 1990 and began being implemented in 2009 . http://www.euronews.com/2015/05/14/portuguese-language-reform-law-goes-global/, 
  who made the map ? 
  norway 's svalbard is n't colored in !, 
  you 're in poland !, 
  we get more than enough somalis in [ wealthy parts of ] europe . 
  probably as norway 's already part of the eu 's battlegroups . 
  no worries , 
  firstly , esa is n't part of the eu . 
  secondly , that seems like `` cherry picking '' facts . 
  romania , bulgaria and other poor countries contribute a high degree of that 9 % . 
  the eu is n't a charity . 
  the us has even greater problems . 
  esa is n't part of the eu . 
  another dane pointed out this one : https://forcetechnology.com/en/manufacturing-industry/machine-and-metal-industry/space-technology-rocket-nozzle-lauchers-laser-sensor-ndt, 
  even norway * participates * :'), 
  thanks , that was an interesting podcast . 
   but pronunciation and spoken dialect is still very much the same . 
  i 'll just repeat the central quote from the article : `` more and more people are using and pronouncing words in the way that people from london and the south-east do '' . 
  i do n't know your country as well as you do , but the researchers surely know a lot more than both of us . 
  you mean our trillion dollar fund ? 
  yeah , we 're ready for it . 
  the oil represents < 25 % of our gdp anyways . 
  did you not notice the fall in the oil price ? 
  we 've already seen the worst ( layoffs , bankrupt firms ) . 
  in many ways it 's already `` run out '' . 
  you may certainly claim that , but the researchers say otherwise . 
  here 's one such study : http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/cambridge-app-maps-decline-in-regional-diversity-of-english-dialects, 
  thanks , yeah , that document was on my mind , but i chose to not make my post too detailed , 
  yeah , but it 's converging , according to some ox-bridge uni study . 
   mangling of a version pre-mangled overseas ? 
  the pre-mangled version could become the standard for europeans in the distant future . 
  as for mangling that version again , based on what i 've read some researchers predict that it could become an entirely legitimate , new form of english . 
  on par with american , australian and indian english . 
  it would sound strange and mangled to some english speakers , but it could become normal for europeans . 
  a bit like french in quebec and france ( or rather vice versa ) . 
  the union is n't a federation at the moment , so it does make sense to change the name to reflect it .
