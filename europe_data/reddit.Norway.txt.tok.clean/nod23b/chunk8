  yes , but european english ( see eu vocab ) . 
  you brits are also losing your dialects , and increasingly speak a standardized london dialect . 
   become not english but american english . 
  it would be [ european english .

   the ottoman empire is likely to be resurrected . 
  i think sultan erdo\u011fan i is well on his way to doing that ... 
  norway and denmark did n't have the same laws since 1604/1687 . 
  your knowledge of norway is very limited . 
  unfortunately for you it 's in the details . 
  norway has done this for the last * three * centuries ... longer than finland and sweden  https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2016/apr/11/when-it-comes-to-tax-transparency-norway-leads-the-field, 
  yes , we have it here as well . 
  it 's certainly popular with children , but we have our own tradition surrounding halloween . 
  i do n't think too many care either way , but we have a few naysayers . 
  no , that film is about the netherlands .

   it will increase the already pretty damn bad segregation problem . 
  yes , unfortunately , but i think you 're fighting a losing battle . 
  segregation is bad in the long term for society , especially in economic terms . 
  we know education quality tends to fall after `` white flight '' . 
  the result is low social mobility , unemployment and crime . 
  on the other hand maybe there 's an alternative ? 
  using public resources on better kindergartens , pre/after school programs , and schools [ with native speakers ] . 
  maybe you have to consider busing students to white schools ? 
  it 's not ideal , but the world is n't either . 
  oslo has avoided the worst scenarios ( see roseng\u00e5rd ) , but the wealthiest neighborhoods remain mostly norwegian ethnic . 
  the city 's divided along east and west . 
  in most city districts it 's more mixed due to costs . 
  the city buys apartments in the wealthy neighborhoods for their users now , and is looking at housing projects there . 
   no one has been building new apartment buildings , immigration , ... bostadsr\u00e4tt it 's strange to read , but i knew most of the details . 
  we have the same challenges with growth , and we have the same co-operative building societies all over norway as well . 
  in oslo they 're one of the biggest builders and '' [ the largest nordic cooperative building association ] ( https://obos.no/om-obos/english ) '' . 
  i suppose the only real difference lies in the fact that they get market prices to compensate for their construction costs . 
  we still have problems building enough , but it 's a very difficult market to supply since there 's such great demand . 
  the city of oslo self-imposed limits on expansion in the last century and fixed in law , it does n't allow building in [ the ample forests around the city for environmental reasons .

  now , that 's bad . 
  well , i 'm not saying it 's the solution for you , but rent control clearly does n't work perfectly either . 
  your second hand market in stockholm is just rotten . 
  in oslo there are market prices and no rent control , it has other effects on people 's ability to live in the city . 
  good to hear !, 
  i remember one of my czech friends telling me something similar about her country . 
   could be that they also have little to no new construction and more people moving to large cities yep , that 's what i expect to hear as well . 
  i will certainly check with my belorussians on monday . 
   yeah each of them have bathroom and toilet  hehe , yeah , i understand that they were n't terrible apartments when they were new . 
  it 's just the maintenance that 's lacking in some . 
  speaking of maintenance , i visited some central and eastern european countries before and after the fall of communism . 
  i remember the dread i felt [ as a student ] when i visited a `` friendship '' school in russia ( late 90s ) ; as we left the the city center where our hotel was , the buildings got worse and worse . 
  the housing estates were falling apart ; they looked like decrepit islands in a sea of mud . 
  the school was like a veritable prison . 
  i never felt so lucky !, 
   i was shocked to see a lot of `` soviet '' like apartments all over vienna when i visited first time . 
  well i guess in 70s you had to solve the population boom somehow yes , we even built some here in norway , but smaller in scale . 
  due to their ownership form , [ housing cooperatives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borettslag ) , the inhabitants maintained and improved them over the years . 
  here are a few of the biggest and `` worst '' in their current state : - [ oslo/enerhaugen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rraxy1s.jpg ) - [ oslo/grorud ] ( http://gfx.dagbladet.no/labrador/251/251883/25188305/jpg/active/978x.jpg ) - [ oslo , grorud valley ] ( http://groruddalen.no/bilder/nyheter/nyhetbig/16005.jpg ) - [ oslo/ammerud ] ( http://www.oppdaggroruddalen.no/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/bilder/ammerud-kalbakken-roedtvet-bredtvet/ammerud3/42607-1-nor-no/ammerud.jpg ) - [ oslo/ammerud 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/ammerud_\\ ( luft \\ ) . jpg ) - [ drammen/str \u00f8tvet ] ( http://www.fotomalik.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/str%c3%b8tvet-blokk-11.feb_-1.jpg ), 
  yes , we have that , but it 's [ un / ] fortunately not rent control . 
  rent control ( capped ) seems to [ have a severely limiting effect ] ( http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20160517-this-is-one-city-where-youll-never-find-a-home ) on the swedish market , with lots of subletting and other shady practices . 
  eurostat . 
  norway ( eea ) , turkey ( currently has trade pact with eu , applying for membership ) cooperate and send data to eurostat . 
  ah , how interesting !, 
  i have some belorussians working for my company ; i 've noticed that they seem to live in small `` soviet '' apartments . 
  the exchange rates ( currency ) have had a negative effect on business . 
  it 's certainly strange and unusual . 
  people usually move around for school , love and work . 
  however , living in the house next door would n't be that strange , but it 's unusual , unless you 're a farmer . 
   does anyone know what sort of rent control is in place rent control ? 
  i hear they have that in sweden , with lots of negative effects . 
  it 's not present in norway for example . 
  do you have it ? 
  is it correct to say guys just have too few apartments in general ? 
  haha , of course , i totally forgot about that profession 's normal hours !, 
  thanks for answering all my questions , 
  now , it makes sense to live alone  are you police or something ? 
  why the strange schedule ? 
  yes , absolutely , 
   at least i 'm not living with my parents , unlike 70-something % of hungarians my age . 
  yep , it has its benefits  on the other hand i often think larger families make more sense . 
  i mean why do my parents , brothers and i have separate homes ? 
   anyway , money things ... 
  it 's kind of depressing actually . 
  it 's bound to be for most people , not that it makes it any easier , 
  i can understand that , but we love and take care of them here as well ?!, 
  at the moment my retired parents ( 70s ) are traveling the world . 
  they have great pensions and a brand new house . 
  they do n't really need any help from me . 
  if they need help i just would n't have to do it all myself , since the public would send trained professionals daily . 
  if they need more care they could move out of their home and live in an assisted living home ( apartments with a common canteen , nurses , etc ) . 
  i just meant to point out that in norway we have a lot of adult students , since we can afford to study more and for longer . 
  i personally went to three colleges for different degrees . 
  yeah , i guess that 's more normal here as well . 
  my parents just did n't mind the people , drinking or loud music . 
  my friends and i would clean up afterwards . 
   that is one reason , yes , but by 24 , most of them will have finished university and looking to start an independent life that 's rather early for norway at least , at least for medicine , law , etc. 
  my law degree was six years standard , without any options or delays . 
  i suppose it 's not terribly expensive ( 50 % for living expenses ) , but i do wonder if you would n't be better off sharing with someone ? 
  a roommate or a girlfriend i mean .
