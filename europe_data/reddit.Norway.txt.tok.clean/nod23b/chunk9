  i envy your 5 min travel , i used to drive  1 h to work every morning , but then again i have a house by the fjord . 
  my parents allowed me to hold parties at home , but only when they were there ( watching tv in one of the upper floors ) . 
  no problem . 
  as a student , that lived at home and worked , i would voluntarily contributed to the household . 
  otherwise , my fairly wealthy parents would have asked for it . 
  on the other hand , when i moved away [ to study ] they gave me spending money monthly . 
  that 's fair enough , but we have public services that do that ( in-house care and cleaning , etc ) or retirement homes . 
  i care for my parents , but i do n't pay for it directly ( see taxes ) . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  it 's like you guys , i mean who cares that you 're * deutsch * and not from holland  / joking on several levels , not least your frieslander background . 
  [ here 's a norwegian mocking dutch . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qustqr9czdq ), 
   i really ca n't remember , if really heard about it in school . 
  it 's understandable , it was rather uneventful by comparison . 
   rather tired of hearing it . 
  i can imagine !, 
  few countries have taken the steps germany has with regards to their history . 
  there are plenty of countries that do n't talk about their past , as i 'm sure you know . 
   `` what 's next - a full documentary on hitler 's shepherd dog ? '', 
  i think it 's the unfortunate case of being one of the first wars to be so heavily documented . 
  that combined with the great numbers of people and emerging technologies involved . 
  after all , there are plenty of genocides and razed cities in humanity 's past . 
  there 's a certain `` blindness '' to humanity 's history in most countries . 
  in a way we 're the victims of our own dominance and technologies . 
  all our faults will be remembered vividly and documented for posterity . 
  everyone around the world learns about the last centuries ' evils . 
  for example , we 're constantly told about the evils of european slavery in the americas , but we rarely see movies about the arab trade that preceded it . 
   i blame it on auto-correct . 
  hehe . 
  what do you mean ? 
  finland is n't scandinavian . 
  estonia is next to finland , neither of them belong to scandinavia . 
   it 's just that this was the perfect example for mining , how infrastructure around it develops , and you were able to explain surface mining and underground mining . 
  ah , yes , i see . 
  in that respect it 's very interesting . 
  especially , now , as they 're moving the entire town . 
   if i remember correctly , norway during ww2 was n't exactly the center of attraction in the curriculum . 
  i read more about norway later , personally . 
  no , fortunately , it was a harsh occupation regime , but the war only seriously ruined the country at the very end . 
  the [ lebensborn programme ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/children-of-shame-norways-dark-secret/a-336916 ) , the heavy water ( nuclear ) programme ( and [ famous sabotage mission ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-22298739 ) ) , and [ the extensive coastal fortifications ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/%c3%9cbersichtskarte_von_s%c3%bcd-norwegen_%281945%29_%285013788545%29.jpg ) are the most interesting pieces of norwegian wwii history . 
  rich . 
  you claimed to have learned about 50 capitols  there is a big difference between capital ( primary city ) and capitol ( building ) . 
   iron ore mining at kirunavaara , sweden haha , that 's an amusing example to pick . 
  it 's like you have your priorities in order . 
  kiruna iron ore was so central to the war effort that it was one of several strategic reasons nazi-germany occupied norway ( see the [ port of narvik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battles_of_narvik ) ) . 
   eesti is trying to buddy up to scandinavia triggered !, 
  you know finland is n't scandinavian , right ? 
  right ?!, 
  most u.s. states ( 39 of the 50 ) have facilities named `` state capitol '' in their capital cities . 
   your flag is easy to remember . 
  russian flag with a crest = slovakia . 
  that 's some joke !, 
   insulting the poor slovenian , 
  yes , it 's just assembly . 
  renault-nissan already has factories lined up from [ spain \\ ( one of the largest \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renault_espa%c3%b1a ) to [ romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automobile_dacia ) that can do this . 
   that 's two european countries . 
  i just mentioned yours and mine as examples . 
  there are plenty of european partners that joined in ; especially in [ afghanistan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_security_assistance_force ) !, 
   but more than twenty other countries are doing nothing . 
  [ operation freedom falcon ( libya ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/coalition_action_against_libya-en.svg/974px-coalition_action_against_libya-en.svg.png ) was a franco-british lead mission , with heavy us support . 
  an operation where both denmark and norway , for example , [ carried out a disproportionate amount of the bombing raids ( same as france ) . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/opinion/31iht-eddaalder31.html?_r=0 ) the initial coalition was made up of the following european partners : belgium , ~ ~ canada ~ ~ , denmark , france , italy , norway , ~ ~ qatar ~ ~ , spain , uk and ~ ~ us ~ ~ . 
  later romania , sweden , netherlands and bulgaria joined in . 
   yes . 
  but it 's japanese/french it 's actually more french/japanese . 
  renault owns 40 % of nissan in a cross-shareholding agreement . 
  the company is called [ the renault-nissan alliance . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renault%e2%80%93nissan_alliance )  we buy plenty of nissans . 
  currently . 
  that may soon change , depending on import taxes to the eu . 
   see that 's the issue in europe . 
  no one wants to intervene overseas really ? 
  i think we 've done a lot of that recently : - france , norway and the nato allies were all over afghanistan and even iraq in some cases . 
  that worked out well , right ? 
  - france and norway , for example , helped `` liberate '' libya - and we 're all paying for that now . 
  the libyans are paying the most . 
  was that a success ? 
  - france and the us are currently bombing the middle east , for all the good it will do . 
  the western support for various militias is controversial to say the least . 
   state building does n't work i could n't agree more . 
  let them sort it out themselves ( yemen ) , but we can aid them in other ways . 
   so unless europe has the balls to take them out and install a capitalist democracy oh , no , thanks we 've learned from past mistakes . 
  iraq and iran should be lessons learned for the us . 
   be prepared for terrorists trained in the new religious yemen no , that 's just hyperbole . 
  yemen has been [ a source of al-qaeda terrorists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-qaeda_insurgency_in_yemen ) and many other forms for a long time . 
  the houthis were fighting both the government and al-qaeda forces before the saudis joined in . 
   considering its proximity to europe it 's pretty far away if you ask me , as a european . 
  saudia arabia and yemen are not in our neighborhood . 
  turkey is the closest we get to the middle east . 
  now , i 'm not saying we would n't notice refugees , but there is a number of countries between us and them . 
  the desert is a formidable obstacle . 
  fortunately they tend to disperse in the region . 
  many yemenis found safety in east africa for example . 
  unlike the syrians who could cross into turkey and lebanon . 
  nissan ~ ~ manufactures ~ ~ assembles many models in the uk . 
  his appearance/ethnicity is not typically norwegian . 
  the eu has lots of agreements with african communities . 
  the poorest african countries were given preferential market access . 
  the latest market access regulation was updated this year .
