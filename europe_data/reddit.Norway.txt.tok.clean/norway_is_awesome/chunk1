in my opinion [ gaud\u00ed ] was the greatest person born in my country i completely agree . 
  the interior of the sagrada fam\u00edlia is the only building that brought this devout atheist to tears , because it 's such an inclusive idea to focus on nature , as the interior brings to mind an ancient forest with majestic , old trees and a dazzling canopy . 
  if we 're talking about building interiors , my favorite is the [ emanuel vigeland museum ] ( http://www.emanuelvigeland.museum.no/img/evm.jpg ) in oslo . 
  as regards exteriors , my favorite in norway is the [ arctic cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arctic_cathedral ) in troms\u00f8 . 
  my favorite building in another european country has to be the [ sagrada fam\u00edlia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sagrada_fam%c3%adlia ) in barcelona , spain . 
   i know sweden is n't a part of nato if this bothers you so much , maybe you should join the ( narrow ) majority of swedes who support nato membership and tell your local mp about this . 
  i am , however , aware of sweden 's reasons for being hesitant about joining nato ( and as a norwegian leftist , i agree with serveral of them ) , but considering sweden 's recent ( potential ? ), 
  territorial breach , this should definitely be considered . 
  i 've clarified my question elsewhere in this thread , but my basic point was that , in other countries , the pm and cabinet appoint deputies for their parliament seats in order to separate the executive and legislative powers . 
  the reason i asked was that , in norway at least , the pm and cabinet , if they were already serving in parliament , appoint deputies to fill their seats so they ca n't vote on their own bills and resolutions . 
  that would be a conflict of interest . 
  most importantly , this separates the executive power from the legislative . 
   norway is a totally different ballpark . 
  how so ?

  yes , i would like fries with that . 
  i can completely understand that . 
  i grew up in sandnes , so bergen ( to a certain degree stavanger ) and oslo were both fair game . 
  i currently live in oslo , though , which can be annoying because my dialect is apparently very hard to understand . 
  i assume you mean [ nyg\u00e5rdsparken ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nyg%c3%a5rdsparken ) . 
  the city actually just closed it to `` clean it up '' . 
  as someone who grew up in western norway , it has to be bergen . 
  such self-important londmouths ... 
  norway has all the oil/gas and fish anyone could wish for . 
  just say the word , ukraine ... 
  when did they cancel [ norger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norger ) ? 
  i ca n't find any recent info on it , but it appears to still be in the planning phase . 
  norway is more than willing to replace russia as your largest supplier , just say the word ... 
  iceland : ` i ` mma let you finish , but ... ', 
  the same policy is in effect in norway , as well . 
  there 's been a push to change it here after new conservative/progress government came into power , but it proved to be fairly unpopular with both employer and employee organisations . 
  it 's useful to point out that this policy exists in both norway and denmark because , in general , it 's pretty hard to fire someone , regardless of reason . 
  this makes it easier to ` rotate the stock ' , i.e. 
  bring in younger people . 
   it was necessary to keep the peace . 
  peace in sweden , you mean ? 
  very relevant for norway right now ... 
  the north remembers , 
  scandinavia + baltics would be a great union ( better than the eu , at least ) . 
  yeah , they even turned vidzeme and southern estonia into [ swedish livonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_livonia ) between 1629 and 1721 . 
  god damn it , [ swedish empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_empire ) . 
  i can understand that , especially given that latvia has only been independent from russia since ( most recently ) 1990/1991 . 
  norway and latvia are similar in that sense , since the german occupation of norway and denmark/sweden basically owning norway outright for hundreds of years , made norwegians more nationalistic than sweden/denmark . 
  the norwegian flag is usually only used in full force on our constitution day ( may 17 ) , but then it 's almost too much . 
  i think we overcompensate for the few occasions we are allowed to flag ( very strict flag rules in norway ) by basically spamming it everywhere on may 17 . 
  the swedes find us to be too nationalistic on may 17 for this reason . 
  in my opinion , both the people doing things that offend people and the people being offended are both entitled to their feelings . 
  i do n't personally tear apart bibles or burn flags or anything like that , but i 'll defend anyone 's right to do these things unconditionally . 
  i think most of those who do these things are doing it to show that they think people take the symbols too seriously . 
  i personally never understood why people are so attached to a piece of cloth ( flags ) , books of fairytales ( bible , koran , etc. 
  freedom of speech/expression means nothing to you , i guess ? 
  and why should symbolic acts like tearing up a bible , ripping a flag or pissing on a constitution be illegal/discouraged ? 
  if these symbols are so fragile that such symbolic acts somehow detract from their importance , they are n't very good symbols , are they ? 
  i 'm sure us norwegians will lease you that open ocean access , for a fee , of course . 
  yeah , i was about to say , the seating layout is horrendous . 
  looks like they spent all the money on the exterior design . 
  you 're right . 
  i was thinking of colonialism/mercantilism , which to be fair , is n't far off from fascism ( thinking of mussolini/franco ) . 
  far right traditionally borders on fascism . 
  previously eradicated diseases like measels , polio and whooping cough are emerging again because of vaccine deniers . 
  if this occurrence reaches a certain threshold ( as little as 6 % non-vaccinated for measles and pertissus ) , herd immunity collapses and we 're all at risk . 
  source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herd_immunity, 
  it 's still somewhat widely believed in norway that brunost is actually healthy , in spite of it being mostly sugar and fat . 
  as a norwegian who does n't like it ( due to spending half my life in the us ) , i constantly live in fear of slipping up and actually admitting to not liking it , which is a surefire way to be branded a blasphemer . 
  indeed ; most oilfields also produce a certain amount of gas , which is usually reinjected for pressure support , or stabilised , transported and sold . 
  free brunost with every purchase , 
  personally , this is a very tricky issue . 
  i surely do n't blindly trust someone just because they were voted into office . 
  they represent the voters of their contituency , but most people are n't very good at lobbying their own representatives , which would make politicians act more like representatives of the people 's will . 
  electoral systems like in the us , where money flows freely to individual politicians and parties , however , appear to be set up to limit the people 's influence over their representatives . 
  campaigns are expensive , so politicians in actuality represent their donors . 
  in parliamentary systems , this is more difficult to achieve , as it is normally harder to donate large sums directly to politicians or parties , at least without it being public knowledge . 
  i still think a combination of direct and indirect democracy is best . 
  referenda should be held on important issues , and elected representatives should vote on less important issues . 
  of course , someone has to decide what constitutes an `` important '' issue ... 
  i definitely think that a combination of direct and representative democracy , sprinkled with term limits for politicians , would be the right way to go . 
  referenda can be an awesome thing , but they need to be used correctly . 
  in this instance , having a referendum on an issue where one outcome will lead to violating already signed agreements and accords , was not the best way to use a referendum . 
  the politicians who organise these referenda need to clarify the ramifications of potential outcomes before they hold them , thus avoiding this flood of uncertainty for everyone involved . 
  i 'm trying to make the point that direct democracy is n't necessarily the best way to go . 
  representative democracy is based on the principle that the average joe is a dumbass and it 's better to have the smartest and brightest lead the country , rather than having referenda on everything ( does n't really work in california either , where they have a lot of referenda ) . 
  this is n't to say that representative democracy is the best option either , ineffective and useless politicians get reelected all the time . 
  what exactly is the difference between direct democracy and direct populism ? 
  the majority is n't necessarily right . 
  the eu is the reason why norway can keep importing engineers to work in the oil and gas industry , because norway is n't producing enough of its own . 
  also , norway being an eea country , we have to implement almost all the rules and have virtually no say in writing them , so some frustration is to be expected . 
  gibraltarians love living in a tax haven , so they should take the good with the bad ... 
  i think ` uninhabited ' is better than ` uncivilized ' . 
  ` several ' politicians , even though they are quite ` severe ' . 
  other than that , good job !, 
  keeping up appearances is amazing , subtle british humour . 
  but i have to agree about eastenders . 
  it 's very similar to the horrendous soap operas on daytime tv in the us . 
  nidarosdomen ( [ nidaros cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nidaros_cathedral ) ) , i presume ? 
  my hometown [ cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stavanger_cathedral ) in stavanger is much smaller , and has been rebuilt several times .

  i almost forgot about her . 
  and to think i just watched some youtube videos the other day in which christopher hitchens eloquently and scathingly explained why both mother theresa and henry kissinger were huge dicks .
