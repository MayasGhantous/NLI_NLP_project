  from an historical perspective , this means this government will be short-lived . 
  the danish people 's party ( df ) are most likely going to be a pain in rasmussen 's ass , even more than their refusal to form a coalition . 
   he might threaten to cross the middle and make a government with the socialdemocrats . 
  am i the only one who thinks that would be an awesome experiment , if nothing else ? 
  the parties are much more similar than they admit . 
   df ( most seats of any governing party ) they do n't want to be in government , though . 
  they 'll probably just end up providing parliamentary support to the centre-right government . 
  he also ruined the only party that could have prevented the tory majority government . 
  this is happening in most western countries . 
  in the us , they 're constantly talking about how those over 65 are deciding the outcomes of elections simply because they turn out to the polls . 
  a majority of economists agree that income and wealth inequality is a large problem throughout the world , and an inheritance tax is one approach to solving this problem . 
  your sanctimonious tone does you no credit . 
  what is your authority ? 
  my general stance on the inheritance tax is that , ideally , it should only apply to the top 10 % anyway . 
  middle class and poor people should n't really have to pay it . 
  your example in c. is very specific , and i could come up with tons of examples of rich people who should have paid inheritance tax . 
  you also present it as a death tax , which is how it 's usually presented by the political right . 
  you 're not being taxed because your family member died , you 're being taxed because he/she gave you a large amount of money or assets like a house . 
  you 'd be taxed on that if they gave it to you while they were alive , too . 
   you could argue that inheritance tax is double taxiation taxes are personal . 
  the first person paid income or capital gains tax , but those taxes are only paid in order for that specific person to receive the money . 
  inheritance tax prevents dynasties from accumulating too much money that is kept out of the economy . 
  why do you hate the bbc ? 
  the vast majority of people who inherit usually do n't inherit enough for the tax to come into effect . 
  norway does n't have inheritance tax anymore , but you could inherit up to eur 56 000 without any tax . 
  inheritance tax is how you prevent dynasties and avoid too much money accumulating with those who are already rich . 
  for instance , the now repealed inheritance tax in norway did n't come into effect unless you inherit eur 56 000 , and even then it was only 6 % . 
  the double taxation argument that is often made is bullshit , because taxes are personal . 
  whoever earned the money paid income tax ( or more likely a capital gains tax ) , which has zero impact on the person who would inherit this money . 
   everyone is a winner . 
  the eu does n't work that way !, 
   norway , for example , has exactly what british eurosceptics aspire to . 
  no we do n't . 
  we have zero say in the rules and regulations that are passed , we have to implement them and shut up . 
  we also pay just as much as the uk , if not more per capita , to fund the eu . 
  i like the idea , but how do you propose we broadcast to the target ? 
  a loudspeaker on the drone itself would be too far away for anyone on the ground to hear . 
  i think they drop leaflets sometimes in advance of bombing , which seems like a good idea . 
  my primary concern is giving non-combattants ( civilians ) the opportunity to show that they are n't a threat before we bomb more wedding receptions , but that would basically involve taking them at their word . 
  summary executions are completely fine , in other words ? 
  the way we use drones is literally creating more terrorists than it 's eliminating . 
  [ technically correct ** is ** the best kind of correct ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x8nksx5.jpg ) , after all . 
  as someone who works as a translator in europe , this is interesting . 
  while i do n't use much machine-translation , i do use [ cat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer-assisted_translation ) ( computer-assisted translation ) tools , which basically build a database of sentence pairs and terminology in different languages and leverages this to translate pretty much anything . 
  technical stuff with repetition is obviously the best use for this stuff . 
  while we are seeing a general trend in europe towards more automation and machine-translation combined with post-processing , i do n't think human translators can be entirely eliminated , mostly because we 're just not there yet , technologically . 
  it 's still fairly easy for humans to spot a machine translation . 
  no , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4in%c3%a4m%c3%b6inen )  he 's the inspiration for gandalf and tom bombadil . 
   iku turso oh , right . 
  it 's obviously v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen . 
  if you 're talking about producing natural gas on land ( fracking or otherwise ) , i do n't think norway will ever do that . 
  natural gas-fired power plants are considered to be too polluting in norway , and the only ones we have are primarily used for research . 
  offshore , that 's a whole different ballgame . 
  most of the norwegian continental shelf is already open for drilling , except the sector around the lofoten and vester\u00e5len archipelagos in northern norway , and all that gas is exported , primarily to the uk , but also to the continent . 
  edit : figured i could also point out that the northern barents sea and arctic ocean have yet to be opened for petroleum activity . 
  especially around svalbard , things get more complicated . 
  due to the svalbard treaty , the land is part of norway , but anyone from any of the signatory states can travel to svalbard without a visa . 
  there is most likely oil/gas on the shelf around svalbard , but it would be diplomatic suicide for norway to try claiming that area for its exclusive petroleum production . 
  it 's interesting to note that , in spite of the spider web of norwegian/uk gas pipelines in the north sea , there are no gas lines on the norwegian mainland . 
  norway never needed to use its natural gas itself , due to its hydropower . 
   at least acknowledge the fact that there 's a european bias against the turks . 
  how so ? 
  the other genocides have at least been acknowledged by the perpetrators . 
  turkey throws a hissy fit if the armenian genocide is mentioned . 
  much like japan if you mention their war crimes . 
  there are only political votes on historical facts that are disputed by someone more or less important . 
   the ecb 's trillion $ qe programme was n't . 
  and you 're saying every other central bank does n't do this the same way ? 
  quantitative easing is usually not a political decision ; central banks are responsible for it themselves . 
   sounds like the best deal of their life . 
  conditions in italy 's detention centres are deplorable and may even rival some of their home countries as regards risk to their life and health . 
  iirc , it 's illegal for eritreans to leave their country as well , so sending them back is not an option . 
  not to mention the fact that the rolling ` r ' is not used in rogaland . 
  * le-voov * . 
  yeah , is n't lw\u00f3w polish for lviv ? 
  she is also [ admiral in the great navy of the state of nebraska ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nebraska_admiral ) , which is the important one . 
  we ca n't even settle on a single official written form of norwegian , so we have one that is only used by about 16 % of norwegians , but both are taught side-by-side in norwegian schools . 
  for being a quisling . 
  actually , norway has the world 's highest farm subsidies . 
  according to [ this financial times article ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2eb60c5c-2035-11e3-9a9a-00144feab7de.html#axzz3u0okmpf5 ) , nowegian subsidies account for 63 % of farmers ' income . 
  norwegian alcohol and drug policies are heaviliy influenced by puritanism , and it 's the area of society , i 'd argue , where the christian democrats have the most political power . 
  this is very unfortunate , and it 's clearly the reason why so many norwegians buy so much alcohol from sweden and denmark , not to mention smuggled and bootleg alcohol . 
   danish alcohol is only as affordable as german when on sale . 
  in norway , it 's illegal to have a sale on any alcohol . 
   breivik as a norwegian who was only a few blocks from the bomb he set off in oslo , i think him having to spend the rest of his life in prison is much worse for him than `` putting a bullet in his head '' . 
  revenge has no place in justice . 
   nah , at that point justice should come into play . 
  i think you mean retribution/revenge , not justice . 
  rehabilitation * is * justice . 
   anything that stops the uk being able to change regulation or put in place new regulation wo n't be best for the uk . 
  i do n't think there 's a ` good ' deal to be made . 
  every scenario has the uk respecting the four pillars . 
  disregarding the eea , which is objectively a worse deal , because it involves implementing eu legislation without any say on the content , even switzerland has to abide by the four pillars outside the eea . 
  even [ the pm is worried ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit ) about businesses leaving the uk . 
  as norway has learned , for better or worse , the eu drives a hard bargain . 
  norway pays '' [ about # 623 million * or # 119 a head ] ( https://infacts.org/norwegians-pay-same-brits-eu-access/ ) '' for access to the single market . 
  : [ `` access to the single market requires acceptance of all four freedoms . '' ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/684968/eu-four-freedoms-what-freedom-of-movement-goods-capital-services-workers-european-union ) edit : switzerland tried to curtail freedom of movement through their 2014 referendum , but have been forced to [ back down ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/switzerland-votes-for-compromise-to-preserve-relations-with-eu ) :  `` we can not set a precedent on free movement , especially not now , given the uk situation , '' said one eu diplomat . 
  `` we ca n't have caps or quotas or emergency brakes and single market access . 
  the swiss have taken a decision and it has certain consequences . 
  they will have to find their own way out . '' there have already been repercussions ; switzerland has since been ejected from the eu 's science research programme , horizon2020 , and the erasmus student exchange programme .
