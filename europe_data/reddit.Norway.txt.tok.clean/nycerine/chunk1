well , that 's a bit of a mistake . 
  : / either way , it does look quite beautiful -- could be a nice and somewhat tight community there ( or not , you never quite know with student dorms ) . 
  that must be a fairly recent building , no ? 
  i 've added that to my travel list ; thanks for the note !, 
  it seems you 're replying from the standpoint of someone living in riga , which is quite cool !, 
  i 've been staying in riga for the last week , and even took a day-trip on some soviet-era diesel trains up to ligatne ( augsligatne ) , just to walk to the previously secret bunker . 
   i 'm thinking about going back to latvia to see more , as i did n't get the time to stroll around in sigulda , nor check out one of the southern palaces -- any particular recommendations , for someone both keen on the beauty and the old artifacts of the soviet occupation ? 
  i think this comic is fairly apt in -- at the very minimum -- illustrating the shifting back and forth that seems to be happening , with neither greece or the eurogroup illustrating an outwards clear resolve . 
  now that you mention it , it is so ... * obvious * . 
  how could i not know ? 
  sure , but ... * we * ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ mean , ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ wrong !, 
  it 'll be interesting to see how it unfolds , but hopefully the parties together can come to a solution that is ideal for both greece and everyone in the eea it impacts . 
  no worries , i know the feeling !, 
  that may be one of the plausible outcomes , but i do n't see how that relates directly to my comment ... ? 
  either way it leaves a sour taste for other countries that they 'd ideally want as a part of the euro . 
  perhaps you would n't mind sharing them ? 
  given how yanis varoufakis have resigned now , it seems it was an unfortunate former situation . 
  it would have been more interesting if politics were n't so damn human . 
  i 'm sorry you feel that way . 
  regardless , i hope you 'll get to see some other points of views and perhaps come to agree that there are a lot of unnacounted variables still in play . 
  either way we live in * interesting times * . 
  this is very much the kind of exact '' * this will happen !!!, 
  * '' spirit i 'd hope people would n't dig trenches for . 
  furthermore , linking to one article , which in relevance consist of quotes from a person with three different roles , is not a way to gain a complete overview . 
  there is no '' * the only question * '' . 
  i wish everybody would take a step back and contemplate how many different opinions , quotes and directions that people , councils and nation representatives have uttered , and in that regard be able to accept that we 're entering waters where you ca n't just * know * exactly what 's going to happen . 
  i say that with the hope that people will let go of '' * certainly now there 'll be a grexit !!!, 
  * '' , as well as things similar to '' * now the troika have lost and we 'll see debt restructuring !!!! * '' . 
  perhaps we can accept that * nobody __ knows __ * , and try to get a good overview instead ? 
  if so , [ his tweet seems to indicate otherwise ] ( https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/617734804914708480 ) . 
   `` in 24h we could have an agreement '' , i said . 
  but our toxic media rushed to report that i predicted an agreement within 24h . 
  maybe , maybe not !, 
   shitty infrastructure in terms of * public transport * , yes . 
  road quality is * good * relative to the national level , and in many cases surpasses a lot of places in terms of traffic being low , since it 's relatively calm . 
  easier to commute up north than down south , that 's for sure . 
  it-wise infrastructure is n't a problem , and nor is cellular coverage . 
   long distances in jest : boohoo !, 
  ^ i ^ kid !, 
  the longer distances are in many cases irrelevant , as you 'd spend right about the same time getting to the various things you need if you take into account traffic levels down south ( south being more east , but i 'm not sure if you 're referring to * southern * norway , or * s\u00f8rlandet * ) . 
   bad cities this needs to be elaborated on : saying they 're bad is something , but what in particular drags them down ? 
  i 'll be the first to say that you wo n't find the same level of diversity in activies up north , but hey : find me a norwegian that attends all of the full range of activities by the diversity offered in the metropolitan cities and i 'll be impressed !, 
  norwegians seem to be that whether they 're in oslo or troms\u00f8 , they seldom go for being a full time jack of all trades . 
  worthwhile mentioning how while housing are magnitudes cheaper up north , the wage difference is n't remotely as high as the housing costs ? 
  if i want to get a home where i currently live , i 'll need to spend around 9,5 mil . 
  nok if it 's to be a normal sized apartment for me and my cohabitant . 
  up north , where i 'm from , i can get a home for 500k nok and i 'll spend less time every day commuting , with less traffic . 
  ^ ^ except ^ ^ for ^ ^ moose ^ ^ on ^ ^ the ^ ^ road . 
   shit weather right now it 's shitty , but that greatly depends on the season !, 
  seeming as you 're from the north , i 'd imagine you know this better than most !, 
  :d we 've had great summers and shitty summers , just like down south . 
  plus , we have midnight sun -- and that 's something i absolutely love every damn summer i spend up north . 
  however , is it cold and sucky right now ? 
  yes . 
   lack of jobs this definitely can be the case , although if you live nearby a city it 's not the biggest killer . 
  unfortunately it 's a bit of a chicken-and-the-egg situation , but i 'd look at the economic growth in the northern cities , and take into consideration that just moving south does n't solve anything there . 
  the * major * ( norwegian context here ) cities are either stable or increasing in population , while it 's the district areas that die out . 
  here you 're more likely to find people commuting , and as such it 's still not much of a problem , but certainly : niche jobs with specialist academic backgrounds will be more challenging , but that 's not something that * the south * solves . 
  for your niche , specialist academic background you 'll most likely need to go to the niche , specialist regional area where it applies . 
  what is a bit lengthier than intended is not to say that the north is on par with the south in terms of exports , nor necessarily growth . 
  however , i 'd hope it is a slight chance that i could convince you that the regional situation is n't remotely as black and white as you seem to have imagined , especially not when you say it 's better in pretty much every way . 
  perhaps you 're currently in the middle of a smaller district , far away from a smaller city with proper fiber access and similarly ? 
  what ?!, 
  in * every * way ?!, 
  son , what have you been smoking ? 
  the more the merrier !, 
  the friends i know all enjoy a good blow , preferably somewhat stable , to cool down . 
  should it be winter of course , drafts are n't quite as fun , but that 's because nobody likes frozen hair . 
  it 's a minor thing , especially as we 're not even part of the eu , but as part of eea we still end up with a big chunk of the free movement tidbits . 
  as such , there has been an extreme increase in polish workers over here , with some news surrounding issues with mafia establishment that affect the polish * when they return home * . 
  on the other hand , some state roads have cost slightly less . 
  beyond that , our cuisine is so imported that the big usual brands , cheap or not , still rule and we still barely have people buying any european food exports that are n't fruit and/or certain vegetables . 
  kudos to you for noting that you 're not sure about your initial statement though . 
  of course they do n't . 
  neither do * any other subreddit * . 
   maybe you should kick your cocaine addiction . 
  that 's a ridiculous amount of money . 
  if you [ take note of his comment further `` down '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35bqw3/weekly_hours_at_minimum_wage_to_move_out_of/cr369e3 ) , it seems that $ 1100 was a typo -- and that he meant $ 110 . 
   no , they 're certainly not , you could find plenty of counterexamples . 
  two things : 1 . 
  whether or not laws themselves discriminate between different people is n't a part of that . 
  a system of justice may certainly not be * equally applied * to people , but that does n't change the intent . 
  if you 'd like a refinement of the sentence , it could be :  * i believe that all of our laws [ should be and ] are [ in the spirit of them ] * equal for all of us * . 
  it 's not corruption that is the subject here . 
  otherwise , please do elaborate . 
   why ? 
  he killed more than 70 people for no reason . 
  we do not need people like this in our society , even though some people thinks `` all life are equal '' . 
  whether * all life is equal * is true or not , i believe that all of our laws are * equal for all of us * . 
  he does n't deserve fair treatment - we owe it to ourselves to give him the fair treatment , so that we and the rest of society can keep it at the level of justice and * ideal-ness * we seek . 
  does n't make him any less of a cunt . 
  if you had friends who are n't with us anymore , i know how you feel . 
   so many resources have been wasted on this shit . 
  so many man-hours . 
  he does get a lot of attention , which i think is a rather unfortunate way to spend resources and time . 
   he should have been killed on the island . 
  there is no reason to respect his rights and there is no reason to let him live . 
  i could not disagree more with both of these statements . 
  such is life .
