i selected `` other '' because my country is not in the eu . 
  i would guess a few of them just saw the norwegian flag and clicked it . 
  people have flairs , though . 
  not since 2012 !, 
  yeah , that 's a good point . 
  inland norway can get really cold in winter . 
  i 've experienced -30 , and some places even see -40 . 
  the coast , on the other hand , rarely gets below -15 . 
  like switzerland ? 
  yes . 
  do you know how statistics work ? 
  such a sample size is normal in polls , and gives error margins within a few percentage points , given that the selection is unbiased . 
  same in norway . 
  the store has to be smaller than 100 square meters or located in a tourist area . 
  it 's the most interesting part !, 
  unbelievable that they hide the votes from each country . 
  [ this ] ( https://tislegaardskole.wikispaces.com/file/view/soss.png/118287379/soss.png ) is how people from b\u00e6rum are viewed in norway . 
  not exactly death metal . 
  huh . 
  helsinki is about the same size as oslo , and [ this site ] ( http://www.islam.no/islam_i_norge.aspx?category=1 ) suggests 34 mosques in oslo ( i suppose they 're liberal with the definition , but still ) . 
  there 's not a single mosque in helsinki ? 
  russia begins in the gulf of bothnia . 
  hehehe , kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 . 
  hehe , too bad i do n't know much about phonetic spelling . 
  there are two distinct sounds . 
  the sh sound known from english , written sj , skj or sk . 
  then we have the kj sound , similar to german `` ich '' , which is written kj , or just k in front of i/y . 
  no , we do n't ? 
  it 's just the oslo area , the border to sweden is a bit further east . 
  no , the blue one north of oslo ( oppland ) is in between . 
  we 're with you !, 
  it 's known as hellas in norway . 
   yeah you are not getting those . . 
  what about the norwegian parts of sweden ? 
  to be honest , i would say most cities are like that ... 
  i always rely on public transport when i travel to different european cities , and it has never , ever been a problem . 
  but i guess some people think it 's a hassle they do n't want to deal with on vacation . 
  in norway we like to start our weekends a little early  so on fridays many people leave e.g. 
  3 pm instead of 4 pm . 
  hahaha , that 's a nice one . 
  one question , though : do swedes really work until 5 pm on fridays ? 
  i want to add that swedes and danes do n't really have the same language , but they 're similar . 
  all the three scandinavian languages ( norwegian , swedish , danish ) are mostly mutually intelligible . 
  although both scandinavians ( / swiss ) and americans have a lot of guns , my impression is that they have it for different reasons . 
  owning a gun to protect yourself and your family , which is a reasoning used by quite a few americans , would be entirely unheard of here in norway , for example . 
  the thing with denmark could possible be about greenland ? 
  that if it 's included denmark is a large country , and people wonder why . 
  right , mine is a bit closer . 
  without electricity included :p, 
  not bad , i pay 650 $ for 14.5 m ^ 2 in trondheim . 
  i have n't done anything illegal today , ama, 
  if you move to another continent you 're automatically an invader ? 
  we 'll finally be able to grow food in our mountains !, 
   intercity which is planned to be finished by the 2023 's . 
  it wo n't reach lillehammer , halden and skien until 2031 :(, 
  i guess i live in the only part of norway poorer than vilnius :(, 
  that would be extremely stupid , given that it would make a lot of information never reach the police , including his motives , and most importantly , whether he had partners or there were more things waiting to happen . 
  you can only check 100 people each year . 
  previously all the newspapers used to have searchable databases with everyone in them ( when there was no limit and not login ) . 
  they still top lists for each municipality , etc. 
  looks like a different culture there . 
  i would never dare to drink one small beer every hour if i 'm supposed to stay sober , haha . 
  no , absolutely not . 
  i was shocked when i saw people in american movies doing that . 
  not sure how this is in the rest of europe , but i 've noticed some cultural differences between scandinavians and americans in this matter . 
  actual conversation from reddit :  [ a ] merican : i want to visit your country , rent a car , go to [ place ] and drink [ alcoholic drink ] . 
    [ n ] orwegians : sure hope you wo n't be driving after that !!!!!!!!, 
  : o : o   a : lol , i wo n't be drunk , will only have 2 drinks . 
  literally having one drink and then getting in the car is completely socially unaccetable here . 
  not sure if we 're sensible or just overdramatic . 
  for many of the cases i think the year refers to the last restoration . 
  nidarosdomen in trondheim , norway is listed as 2001 when it was originally built in 1070 . 
  well , it surely depends on their setup , but here in norway it 's not hard at all . 
  you 're usually prompted to enter the total sum before the pin . 
  at bouvet island ? 
  ehm , 25 degrees is n't really uncommon here . 
  above 30 , on the other hand , does n't happen so often . 
  agree , 
  read about this in a norwegian newspaper . 
  the text said :  not surprisingly , norway got the highest score . 
  we can be pretty smug sometimes . 
  honestly , it 's more of a respectless and needless attack on another country than a political opinion . 
  image is deleted ? 
  if there 's one country in europe that does n't have too many people , it 's ours . 
  really ? 
  that 's confusing . 
  one of the most important , yes , that 's for sure !, 
  title says eu , image says europe . 
  both wrong , although europe is the least wrong . 
  not icelandic , but see / u/temporaryeconomist 's response : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bc8va/what_do_you_know_about_iceland/dhpqh40/, 
  your named after your parents ' first name , not their last name . 
  100 % the same, 
  not only nordic , they can into scandinavia !, 
  the term you 're looking for is the nordics , not scandinavia , seeing that neither finland nor iceland are included . 
  \u00d6de is \u00f8de / \u00f6de in scandinavian too , and you 're correct in assuming that there is a connection between that word and \u00f8rken / \u00f6ken . 
  the pitch is of standard size , 100 x 60 meters .

  where in oslo , if you do n't mind ? 
  too bad finland is n't scandinavian . 
  i 'd agree with you a year ago , but ... you know .
