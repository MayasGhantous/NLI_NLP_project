  yes . 
  i do n't want to go full hitler , but i do n't think that is where the most scandinavian ancestry is found . 
  probably quite a bit of sami in the mix . 
  from my rural childhood : barneskolen ( 1-7th grade ) - ca 130 ungdomsskolen ( 8-10th ) - ca 180 videreg\u00e5ende ( 1-3 ( 11-13 ) ) - ca 500 university - ca 40 000, 
  yeah , they did n't do it earlier . 
  but there 's nothing wrong about being more polite , 
  nothing , preferably . 
  haha , thanks :d, 
  apology accepted , i guess . 
  norwegian and swedish is very similar . 
  finnish , on the other hand ... 
  different language familiy , completely incomprehensible . 
  that 's swedish  :(, 
  it means i 'm beautiful pretty , thanks !, 
  * stares blankly *, 
  truly disgusting and un-norwegian . 
  my mother is a high school teacher . 
  she says that for the last few years students have started asking `` hvordan g\u00e5r det ? '', 
  ( how are you ? '' ), 
  to her and generally shown another form of politeness than earlier . 
  norway is more expensive , but the wages are higher . 
  recommended once a year , but i must admit it 's been quite a bit longer for me now . 
  10 liters of pure ethanol or 10 liters of beer/wine/spirits ? 
  yep , very common in gardens . 
  for some reason i ca n't remember seeing it being sold . 
  paid lunch :o do you need to be available during lunchtime , or is it just an extra perk ? 
  also common here in inland east . 
  and delicious !, 
  have n't heard it . 
  woop , great plan !, 
  seriously . 
  i pay at least 25 $ , and that 's cheap here . 
  for some reason norway always watch it on the 23rd . 
  no christmas without it !, 
  as any other norwegians , yes , i have relatives in the usa . 
  unfortunately i have n't been in contact with them . 
  my grandfather used to spend a lot of time writing letters , and i think he also met some of them a few times . 
  statistics for all names in norway here : https://www.ssb.no/navn mine is uncommon , only 23 people . 
  all of them have their name from one of three ( originally one ) farms . 
  solid 10 , it makes me feel sooo good . 
  looks like you 're right . 
  that 's brutal . 
  hard to disagree . 
  it killed 1/3 of the population and effectively set the society several hundred years back . 
  works beautifully in norwegian !, 
   swedish is understandable by most norwegians , danes and some finns . 
  and some icelanders . 
  also a few swedes, 
  every network has their own streaming service . 
  that includes nrk , state television , which has an enormous archive available for free to any norwegian ip . 
  edit : but maybe i misread the question . 
  i think some internet/cabel providers have the tv channels they offer available as online streams . 
  i think it 's pretty big . 
  karpe diem are well known and mainstream , and many other artists are popular . 
  the language is exclusively norwegian . 
  it 's called roggbif , so indigo is usually included . 
  i would guess about 5 times a week on average . 
  edit : uhm , a little surprised that someone downvoted this ? 
  but it seems to have happened to a few other comments as well . 
  no , have n't heard of him or his books . 
  sad :(, 
  sure , some dialects are a bit heavy , but if you keep out the strangest words and slow it down a bit that should n't be a problem . 
  not sure what / u/lohrenswald meant , but my experience is that norwegians and swedes speak their own language to each other . 
  myself i would be kind of offended if a swede spoke to me in english , but probably not all see it that way . 
  i see !, 
  i 'm also an it guy . 
  i would say it 's one of the fields with the best job market in norway at the moment , 
  what do you want do to in finland , denmark or sweden that you do n't think you can do in norway ? 
  true !, 
  for special occassions like 17 . mai , confirmations and graduations , yes . 
  otherwise , not at all . 
  never had that tradition myself , but i know a lot of people do that , and it sounds lovely . 
  sorry , seals ? 
  you must be secretly swedish, 
  sure . 
  we 're proud of how we celebrate 17 . mai . 
  all cities , towns and villages are packed with people , all organizing a local [ barnetog ] ( http://1.vgc.no/drpublish/images/article/2014/04/10/23037575/1/990/2131227.jpg ) . 
  people wear traditional clothes such as [ bunader ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/young_girls_in_bunad.jpg ) , and eat ice cream and hot dogs . 
  really ? 
  think i 've seen it all over the country . 
  i 've sometimes tipped , but i 've mostly stopped . 
  it 's not awkward at all , most place require you to type the sum to pay before the pin anyway . 
  sounds like norway , though i 'm exactly what you mean by liberal government . 
  the current government is conservative , and the one from the autumn will probably be social democratic . 
  one should think people would make the connection to meter . 
  or do they say `` met '' as well ? 
  i was used to saying norway has 4.5 m , but soon i need to start saying 5.5 . 
  no , never seen that . 
  n\u00e5o , \u00f8nf\u00e5rtjuneiteli its n\u00e5tt s\u00e5o p\u00e5pular :(, 
  we already have one for norwegian : / r/inglisj, 
  not necessarily , but that was n't the question ? 
  standard bokm\u00e5l / oslo in the news : https://youtu.be/zge-yqhqufc, 
  sure , she speaks very slow and articulate , that might certainly affect the melody of the language too . 
  seems like an interesting study . 
  but i 'm not sure how much sense the remark about bokm\u00e5l makes . 
  there are no official pronunciation rules for bokm\u00e5l , which is just a written standard , so in practice it is most of the time read just like the modern oslo dialect . 
  i see . 
  could be that she does it differently than others , but at least it 's not something i noticed as weird , 
  no , it 's not exaggerated . 
  eastern norwegian is known as `` singy '' , but as a native to the area i do n't really hear it .
