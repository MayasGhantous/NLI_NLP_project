  sure , but they wo n't afford everything when only one parent is working . 
  some have argued that the country has `` mastersyken '' -- master 's sickness . 
  what 's meant by that is that too many jobs require master 's degrees these days and many are forced to take more education than what would strictly speaking be necessary . 
  the version with bieber has topped the charts for a long time . 
  i know you asked for eu citizens , but i 'll answer anyway : for norway i personally think the future looks bright . 
  there are some issues , like what we will do after the oil , but i do n't think we are worse off economically than previous generations , for example . 
  but of course , there are several concerning global issues , like climate change , extremism and populism . 
  do n't know . 
  i just know that we 're sometimes included , but far from always . 
  i like both nugatti and nutella , but i agree that nutella seems very oily in comparison . 
  i love statistics , so i 'm always a little sad if there is no data for norway . 
  sweden and denmark are the obvious choices . 
  iceland would also be cool , and i could see myself living in the netherlands . 
  when graduating from high school ( videreg\u00e5ende ) , we usually just wear our [ russ clothes ] ( http://touch.gat.no/polopoly_fs/1.1000293.1395433351!/image/1215068217.jpg_gen/derivatives/facelift_980/1215068217.jpg?ref=0x7e1e9a33e964377e4f82f1a209445200da0fc1db336645c12617593195c816c9 ) . 
  no , not really any need for that in norway . 
  the sweden-denmark union , ruled by norway . 
  sounds lovely !, 
  also we do n't use whatsapp , but messenger ( by facebook ) . 
  spanish = handsome ? 
  haha , i guess that 's what he was thinking !, 
  if i 'm not mistaken , it 's among the three `` core subjects '' : norwegian , math , and english . 
  went on a high school trip to germany . 
  me and my friends look pretty nordic , so i guess we were a bit surprised when the shopkeeper asked us `` are you from norway , or spain ? '', 
  unfortunately not . 
  that 's a great idea , though , too bad it 's too late to swap it . 
  had three slices of bread for breakfast , went to university afterwards . 
  now i tell myself that i 'm working on my master 's thesis , but in reality i 'm here on reddit :(, 
  it , engineering , restaurants , yes . 
  medical , no . 
  honestly no , i ca n't recall any labels . 
  maybe the english/american ones are used from time to time . 
  i live in a 200k city . 
  while i do n't really see them every day , i ca n't remember the last day i did n't at least hear sirens . 
  have n't really seen those machines here in norway . 
  but i 've used them several times abroad , they 're sooo convenient . 
  do you use fahrenheit in romania ? 
  wikipedia, 
  i read that all the stores are sold out and older kids make good money selling theirs to younger kids . 
  but i do n't really know , i 'm too old . 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  welsh ( uk ) 2 . 
  australian 3 . 
  english ( england ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  english 2 . 
  norwegian 3 . 
  swedish pretty good match !, 
  new york , providence and st. luis . 
  had no words for most of the questions , though . 
  agree , but it removes the need to wrap ones head around it , because it 's not supposed to make sense . 
  uhm , i do n't really `` feel '' anything about it . 
  it 's a mostly uncomplicated part of many languages ' grammatics . 
  just do n't think of them as genders . 
  they 're nothing more than categories . 
  191 cm , well above average . 
  well , skiing is our national sport -- but most of the events there are individual . 
  so maybe rather handball ? 
  the european and world championships always have high viewerships . 
  edit : if someone disagrees , i would love to hear their opinions . 
  fascinating . 
  europeer - europeere here . 
  wow , du you really say `` jag \u00e4r europ\u00e9 '' ? 
  what an interesting word . 
  it 's `` europeer '' in norwegian . 
  this is actually a bit controversial . 
  some experts believe `` nor '' comes from a norse word meaning `` narrow '' , possibly named after somewhere narrow you had to sail to get to somewhere in norway . 
  also the language is nederlandsk , 
  absolutely . 
  the problem is a severe lack of resources . 
  not sure about the rules , but i think the normal is 3 . 
  minimum in 25 days ( 5 weeks ) . 
  it does not include sick days or weekends , and i 've never heard of it being able to be transferred . 
  we also have a word for those weeks om the middle of the summer when `` everyone '' are on vacation : fellesferien ( the common vacation ) . 
  it 's illegal , and as far as i know not a significant problem . 
  edit : born in 93 . 
  i live in trondheim , norway . 
  prettiest ( and most historic ) building would be nidarosdomen : [ 1 ] ( https://gfx.nrk.no/dbuyt2vhw8zvipjxqz7h1akoxapwfrybwtewenkscrra ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.universitetsavisa.no/incoming/article54198.ece/ehmwbd/alternates/w980-default/nidarosdomen2.jpg ) ugliest is harder . 
  a while back er had a similar thread in / r/norge , and someone came up with [ this building ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bibne9e.jpg ) at risvollan . 
  yes , those too . 
  sure , i guess what i find ugly is still better than anything east of the border . 
  most beautiful : [ bergen ] ( https://www.visitbergen.com/dbimgs/floyen-in-bergen-norway.jpg ) , or maybe [ \u00c5lesund ] ( https://www.thonhotels.no/siteassets/hoteller/norge/alesund/alesund-destinasjon.jpg?width=1100&amp;height=550&amp;mode=crop&amp;quality=80 ) . 
  almost always 30 minutes in norway . 
  somalis are one of the largest groups of immigrants in norway , but it 's no secret that they 're not as well integrated as many other groups . 
  they have lower participation in work and education than most other nationalities . 
  so i guess the general perception is affected by that . 
  25 % for most things , but : 15 % for food and beverages . 
  8 % for transportation . 
  0 % for newspapers and books . 
  yes , i ca n't see why not . 
  [ a lion and a crown ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/coat_of_arms_of_norway.svg/262px-coat_of_arms_of_norway.svg.png ) . 
  much less level of detail than some of the others posted here . 
  maybe i should have said modern football . 
  you 're insane, 
  no sane person would consider any other option than flying between lisbon and moscow . 
  the invention of football . 
  til that if i ever open a store , it will be called poor :(, 
   is there any famous norwegian that speak with a stavanger dialect ? 
  a lot !, 
  to name a few : * per inge torkelsen * mia gundersen * kristoffer joner * tore renberg * kristian valen * pia tjelta * brede hangeland * hans morten hansen, 
  i tried making one myself : http://i.imgur.com/ltfc1ef.png dark red is lived in , red is slept at least one night , pink is passed through or visited . 
  not bad !,
