  yes , of course we ca n't take in everyone . 
  i just think it 's a bit na\u00efve to believe that we can help everyone locally . 
  like you say , lebanon has millions of refugees . 
  lebanon is a tiny country with a population similar to that of norway . 
  needless to say , a lack of infrastructure and money is n't their only problem . 
  two months , from about 20 june to 20 august . 
  man , imagine the complaining if you had to learn to write in bokm\u00e5l , nynorsk and icelandic in school !,

  uh , is that an old picture ?

  always well accepted , as far as i can tell . 
  true , forgot about the sum . 
  quite a few do that , but far from all . 
  edit : but they never say the \u00f8re . 
  your example would just be 140 . 
  it 's much more guarded than other embassies .

  if the cashier is really chatty , then maybe : - thanks , have a nice day / good bye !,

  most grocery stores close no later than 11pm . 
  in principle they 're all closed on sundays and national holidays ( like today ) , but there are some exceptions : stores under 100 square meters are allowed to stay open , and the same goes for stores located in `` tourist areas '' . 
  there is also an exception the last sundays before christmas . 
  my experience is that in oslo there are quite a few stores being open all night , but this is rare in the rest of the country . 
  i live in the third biggest city in the country and have to rely on kiosks and gas stations if i want to shop after midnight . 
  bars close at a time set by the local authorities , often 2am or 3am . 
  getting any food other than kebab and burger after midnight is hard . 
  there are in total a little more than twice as many boys as girls playing organized football in norway . 
  children : 118,000 boys vs. 55,000 girls teenagers : 69,000 boys vs. 32,000 girls adults : 76,000 men vs. 23,000 women, 
  ski , slalom . 
  i think my family farm used to have an inverse swastika ... yeah , we do n't use it anymore . 
  i was immediately thinking of those two countries when i saw the topic , 
  people can identify as what they want for me , but usually history plays a role in these things . 
  parts of my country are as far east as turkey , but i do n't think anyone here feel eastern european . 
  you identify as eastern european ? 
  the last sentence made me curious . 
  were you thinking of lutefisk ? 
  i think there might be some regional differences . 
  i almost feel farmor/farfar/mormor / morfar is somewhat more urban ? 
  at least it 's not very common where i 'm from , which is in the country . 
  well , you did n't even make / u/amplome 's top 5 list , so you have a long way to go , my friend . 
  nordic guy : i prefer germany over estonia . 
  estonian guy : surely that ca n't be right !, 
  i did n't mean anything bad , just thought it was a little funny when i read it that way . 
  i 'd say it depends . 
  i only say bestemor and bestefar , but i hear farmor/farfar/mormor / morfar quite a lot . 
  you 're so sweet when you want to get into nordic , 
  eea is a special cooperation agreement between eu and norway , iceland and liechtenstein . 
  it affects many areas and sometimes makes it feel like we 're almost eu members . 
  norway does n't want to join the eu because we want to protect our own fishing and agriculture , among other things . 
  i guess that 's why we got a special deal . 
  eu/eea gives citizens the right to live and work in another member country . 
  schengen is a `` borderless europe '' , at least in principle . 
  it consists of eu/eea , minus uk and ireland ( and romania , bulgaria and croatia , but they 're supposed to join ) , plus switzerland . 
  bonus : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/supranational_european_bodies-en.svg/500px-supranational_european_bodies-en.svg.png, 
  no worries  norway ( and switzerland ) are the odd ones . 
  we 're not part of eu , but as eea and schengen members , we have the same freedom of movement within the `` union '' . 
  norway shares borders with sweden , finland and russia . 
  i 've been to sweden and finland , and that 's always a smooth journey . 
  i have n't been to russia , which would require some more paperwork . 
  then it 's a completely different question . 
  i live in norway , so i 've been in and out of the eu a lot of times . 
  never a hassle -- but that 's because we 're in schengen . 
  the scandinavian countries . 
  now we three brothers stand united , and shall stand like that !, 
  and if you decide to try some hikes , know that they can all be completed wearing high heels and with no spare clothes or food , no matter the time of the year . 
  i guess op means recent terrorist attacks , the political situation in some european countries , etc. 
  but yeah ... 
  it does n't impact my quality of life , at least . 
  in norway a lot of people use an app called vipps .
