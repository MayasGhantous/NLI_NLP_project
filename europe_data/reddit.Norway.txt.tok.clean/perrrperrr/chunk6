  also , we have had contactless cards for a few years , but i 'm still surprised every time i 'm able to pay without the chip . 
   it 's a common meme to write/pronounce it `` mejmej '' . 
  gaaaah , people do that in norwegian too ( megmeg ) . 
  am i the only one to find it extremely unfunny/cringy ( in lack of a better word ) ? 
  i 've always had good experiences with sas . 
  with the second large airline up here , norwegian , not so much . 
  we have mandatory service for both genders , but the military does n't take in as many people as they used to . 
  that way only the most motivated are serving . 
  i think it works great . 
  i obviously see your point , but no , i do n't feel like `` criminals are n't punished hard enough '' is any sort of consensus in norway . 
  if it is , it 's much more about the length of the stays than about the conditions . 
  as for believing in rehabilitation or not , i believe norway has a much lower reconviction rate than the usa , which follows more or less the opposite philosophy . 
  have you been watching pictures from that halden prison ? 
  all prisons in norway are n't like that , not at all . 
  but i support the main idea behind it , and behind our prisons in general , which is that rehabilitation should be the goal for almost all inmates , and that prison should be preparing them for the normal life . 
  i can not understand what good comes from making the facilities as uncomfortable as possible , having ones freedom taken away is already enough of a punishment . 
  not sure , have n't really heard any reactions . 
  well , the constitution states that the kingdom can not be split . 
  some advocated that it could be done as a `` border adjustment '' , but i do n't really think the politicians in charge were too keen on it anyway . 
  i mean the whole civil war . 
  we obviously read different media . 
  i 'm not at all under the impression that his people love him . 
  you support a man that has been terrorizing his own population for years ? 
  no ( if you do n't count the whole `` give finland a mountain for their birthday '' thing , which obviously did n't happen ) . 
  but the super bowl has been shown for quite a few years , with an increasing number of viewers . 
  i know some people who 've started following the nfl because of it . 
  i have a friend who watches a lot of nba , but i would say that 's pretty niche . 
  the newspapers write a lot about zuccarello , but the rest of the nhl does n't get any attention . 
  technically the explanations are in danish ? 
  i do n't think apartheid goes well with european values . 
  it has to be rosenborg for norway . 
  they 're by far the most successful team for the past few decades , at one point winning the league 13 times in a row . 
  that 's a great way to make oneself unpopular with the supporters of other teams . 
  one year of decent ski jumping , and you 're suddenly the best in europe ? 
  i would have thought the vatican was closer to italy , so this is interesting . 
  in my opinion : 1 . 
  sweden : we share a 1600 km border , have mutually intelligible languages and a lot of common history , including a union that ended in 1905 . 
  denmark : our most used written standard is based on their language , and they governed us for 400 years , until 1814 . 
  the languages are mutually intelligible ( i.e. , if the danes remove the potato before they speak ) . 
  iceland : it was first settled by norwegian explorers , and we share a lot of history , particularly from 1100 to 600 years ago . 
  the languages are still similar , but mostly not mutually intelligible anymore . 
  yeah , you 're right there . 
  however , `` per capita '' ? 
  i can not accept that !, 
  i 'll still take it !,

   k\u00f5ik on korras nagu norras ( `` all 's fine as in norway '' ) - when everything is really fine . 
  what a compliment !, 
   sweden at least has lots of nature per capita , as we do . 
  \\* trying really hard not to be offended \\*, 
  i do n't agree . 
  no driver deserves to suffer through the traumatic experience it is to hit a pedestrian , no matter what clothes he wears . 
  that 's a really good idea , it should be illegal here as well . 
  technically our neighbors are sweden , finland and russia . 
  i do n't cheer for sweden because they 're our rivals , and i do n't cheer for finland and russia because i feel no connection to them . 
  sometimes i could see myself cheering for denmark , and definitely iceland . 
   soccer has never been played in europe . 
  well , the term `` soccer '' was first used in england ... 
  we have [ garden ] ( http://gfx.dagbladet.no/labrador/135/135292/13529238/jpg/active/978x.jpg ) , whose main responsibility is guarding the royal palace and other royal residences . 
  one of the companies is a specialized band & drill company , participating in military tattoos . 
  garden also has the penguin [ brigadier nils olav ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/nils_olav_inspects_the_kings_guard_of_norway_after_being_bestowed_with_a_knighthood_at_edinburgh_zoo_in_scotland.jpg/1920px-nils_olav_inspects_the_kings_guard_of_norway_after_being_bestowed_with_a_knighthood_at_edinburgh_zoo_in_scotland.jpg ) as a mascot .

  i thought you were going to post [ this picture ] ( https://morgenbladet.no/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/legacy_images/mo201110710219943ar.jpg?itok=eroj3od_ ) ... ( nsfw ),

  i sometimes tip in restaurants . 
  for other services , no , never . 
  yes , but it 's no secret that the dialects are getting more similar . 
  more specifically , the dialects in the eastern part are getting closer to the oslo dialect , the ones in the west closer to bergen , the ones in tr\u00f8ndelag closer to trondheim , and so on . 
  i do n't like our current government , but yes , i trust them . 
  norwegian : januar februar mars april mai juni juli august september oktober november desember, 
   another thing that is difficult for me is to remember which written ss are pronounced like zs . 
  for example , `` music '' is pronounced with a z. i think this is the most difficult to me . 
  i suspect that most norwegians , me included , just say s all the time . 
  i had no idea music was one of the z words until now . 
  norway , either as an independent nation or as a part of unions with denmark and/or sweden , has been a thing for about 1000 years now . 
  before that the country was comprised of a number of smaller kingdoms , which i absolutely see as `` norwegian '' . 
  `` too often '' or something like that . 
  wow !, 
  indeed . 
  just took the bus . 
  seemed to be about 8 out of 70 or 80 passengers at the time i counted . 
  well , skiing is what norwegians do all winter , so easter is no exception . 
  in the mountains it 's usually sunny and mild , but still snow around that time . 
  i guess the orange thing is just that they used to not be available until easter ? 
  if that makes sense . 
  i found an article claiming that the p\u00e5skekrim started out as an advertising stunt in 1923 , when a publisher in order to promote a book had an ad that said `` bergenstoget plyndret i natt '' ( the bergen railway robbed last night ) . 
  it was a great success , and many people did n't realize it was just an ad . 
  after this it 's become a tradition . 
  it 's definitely not . 
  it 's called `` p\u00e5skekrim '' ( easter crime ) and involves crime shows on tv as well as crime novels . 
  not sure if others do this , but reading crime novels is huge in the norwegian easter . 
  also eating oranges , preferably while skiing . 
  no problem  not sure if was really wrong , just a bit unusual . 
  i 'm 24 and a student , and i do n't . 
  as long as i 'm continuing living in cities , i do n't think i will buy one , but i would if i moved back to the rural area i 'm from . 
   the area has been inhabited since the stone age ( 1.8 million years ? ), 
  modern humans did n't exist back then . 
  although `` the stone age '' is a very little specific term , it usually refers to something along the lines of 10,000 years ago . 
  i live in trondheim , norway , which supposedly was funded by olaf tryggvason in 997 . 
  i orginally come from a rural area where the nearest village did n't grow into anything more than a couple of farms until the railway opened in 1896 .
