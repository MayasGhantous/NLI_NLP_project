kurwa , man , it 's even starting to leak into our language, 
   matte even better . 
  also means `` mat '' . 
  norwegian is confusing . 
  or , well , 0 , in that case ... 
  go home , czech republic , you 're drunk ... literally . 
  no , seriously , what fascinates me about this map is the fact that it includes norway and iceland , and yet disregards most of former yugoslavia as well as the russia-sphere . 
  many of these '' [ x ] in europe '' maps define europe as the eu , so my home country is often disregarded . 
  but this one includes all of the eea . 
  also , why does it then include croatia , despite the fact that these numbers are from 2011 ? 
  croatia * still * is n't actually in the eea , as far as i understand . 
  hollande : i. . . am france . 
  france am i. france is me . 
  me is france . 
  the most terrifying of these to me have to be the uk , sweden , and italy . 
  such awkwardly shaped countries lead to weird cutoffs on the faces of their leaders , and on these types of maps in general . 
  not going to argue with you , just going to [ leave this here ... ] ( http://youtu.be/raa1xgttw9w ), 
  i dreamt up a european subway network a few years ago . 
  i should really finish it soon ... 
   loveu ftfy, 
  i 'd love to !, 
  my government does n't seem as positive , however ... 
  [ here 's a typical oslo one . 
  ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7144/6819996043_c550daf6d0_z.jpg ) i find it somewhat unfair at times how this subreddit is called / r/europe when it mostly acts as / r/eu . 
  switzerland 's neutrality really stands out . 
  [ we will have our revenge ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish%e2%80%93norwegian_war_ ( 1814 ) ), 
  oops !, 
  all of the nordic countries make the top 11 ( dammit sweden , get slightly more peaceful !, 
  ) , which just adds to our education , healthcare , and welfare systems . 
  i 'll make my own nuclear reactor !, 
  with thorium !, 
  and hookers !, 
  in fact , forget the thorium !, 
  apparently , ruter ( oslo 's public transportation company ) is planning to expand its metro ( [ before ] ( https://ruter.no/documents/rutetabeller/oslo/linjekart_t-bane_131215_v2.pdf ) , [ after ] ( http://www.tu.no/incoming/2012/05/16/1200005198.jpg/binary/1200005198.jpg ) ) by the * winter of 2022 * . 
  what might be happening in the winter of 2022 , you ask ? 
  [ well ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oslo_bid_for_the_2022_winter_olympics ), 
  and sea sponges . 
  huh ? 
  sorry , say again please ? 
  you 're too [ low down ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_highest_point ), 
  what are you doing here ? 
  your shift lasts until 8 / partysvenskerjoke, 
  no tyskland , go ask greece if want $ $ $, 
  * unless * you are ... wait for it ... ... us . 
  this made me laugh more than it should have . 
  advantage to being under drinking age : immune to hangovers . 
  really ? 
  right . 
  time zones . 
  i am the eurovision ninja . 
  they visited graham norton 's office . 
  so i was wondering if , on the bbc , it sounded like he was speaking twice . 
  see y' all in vienna next year . 
  so , predictions for next year : * russia withdraws `` for political reasons '' * cross-dressing country music, 
  * i * liked your song . 
  yes . 
  austria 's representative . 
  yes yes yes . 
  suck it russia . 
  this is eurovision . 
  ... what , lithuania ? 
  um ... thank you !, 
  i 've always liked finland . 
  ** france got another point !!!, 
  note : next year , crossdressing country music . 
  i liked your song !, 
  not quite yet . 
  although it is very likely . 
  portugal gave * nothing * to spain ? 
  so at this point anyone can predict that countries outside of the top 5 will not win . 
  i actually really * liked * france ... 
  france got a pity point !, 
  nobody 's going home with nul points !, 
  norway is picking up points here and there . 
  slow and steady wins the race . 
  ( alternate strategy is bearded lady . ), 
  hand over the 12 . 
  edit : 3 ?!, 
  those glasses tho . 
  green screen . 
  iceland is n't far enough north to have the midnight sun . 
  someone give a pity vote to france ... please ? 
  the booing . 
  ffs . 
  hey look , we got a point !, 
  france is still on nothing . 
  that 's disappointing . 
  a few surprises so far . 
  also , enough with the booing . 
  * seriously . 
  nope . 
  mostly the same still . 
  only major difference you 'll probably see is that points 1-7 appear on screen , while 8 , 10 , and 12 are announced . 
  right . 
  voting time . 
  oh , tiny flute man is shirtless this time . 
  granted , that went slightly better for germany . 
  that mini dance the host did was ... 
  remember , that 's the future of eurovision we 're looking at . 
  common mistake .
