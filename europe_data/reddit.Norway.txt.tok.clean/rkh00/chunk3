  swedish is also special in its own way . 
  it 's obviously much more nasal than norwegian , but i think there 's also a much bigger difference between the consonants and vowels . 
  btw : klapperslang ** e **, 
  also `` alfakr\u00f8ll '' . 
  `` alfakr\u00f8ll '' or simply '' \u00e6tt '' in norway . 
  are you sure you 're pronouncing it correctly ? 
  [ here 's a pretty good pronounciation from google translate ] ( http://translate.google.com/#no/en/jeg%20kanke%20h%c3%b8re%20deg ) . 
  ( btw : no reason for me to say this ( i 'm just bored ) but `` you cancer whore '' in norwegian is `` din krefthore '' . ), 
  edit : reddit for some reason posted three different comments , even though i just edited my original . 
  oh well , i 've deleted the extras now . 
  sorry for any confusion . 
  okay , first of all :  f\u00f8rst ud , s\u00e5 ind * ( insert obvious sex joke here ) * next , schools and daycares and big groups of kids also take public transport here , too . 
  most people understand and just sit through it . 
  as the kids get older and aquire more `` experience '' with public transport ( is that a thing ? 
  ) , they break off and sit in their own groups , getting off when their teacher tells/has told them to . 
  yeah , i realized after writing this massive post that this ended up being more of a rant than a contribution to the post/comparison of the systems . 
  that 's why i wrote this at the end of the post :  i had planned for this to only be three or four points , but it ended up being quite a lot longer than that . 
  hope you enjoyed this ~ ~ rant ~ ~ list of rules . 
  ` murica anyone ? 
  amen . 
  ten internet points and a cookie for you . 
  [ i wrote a comment that sparked quite the conversation about this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1tsvr2/this_is_fcking_finland_how_to_behave_on_finnish/ceb4ncx ) . 
  i assume you already saw that before you wrote this . 
  bigger win . 
  ( [ than this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1tsvr2/this_is_fcking_finland_how_to_behave_on_finnish/ceb7m4q ) ), 
  win . 
  and then the worst part is when they finally find space and they start talking on the phone when everyone else is silent and so nobody can hear anything but her and then the baby panics about being surrounded by so many strangers and it starts to whine so now the parent starts talking louder to hear the person on the phone and now nobody can hear anything but `` whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ! '', 
  and `` h\u00d8rer du meg ? 
  and they do nothing about the damn brat !, 
  * exhale * seriously . 
  do n't bring strollers on at rush hour . 
  you 'll ruin everyone 's ~ ~ day ~ ~ week . 
  i hope you enjoyed this rant/run-on sentence . 
  this has now been added to the list . 
  you should be tazed if you break this law . 
  same for norway , basically . 
  on all public transport : * do n't talk to anyone except the people you are travelling with . 
  if you are conversing , do n't be loud . 
  * do n't look at anyone except the people you are travelling with for more than 5 seconds . 
  ideally , stare out the window for the entire journey . 
  * do n't use more than one seat . 
  * do n't answer a phone call . 
  if you 're on the phone when you enter , end the conversation asap . 
  if you are talking loudly , the other passengers have the right to give you the evil eye . 
  * do n't make any noise . 
  seriously . 
  if you are listening to music , have it on low volume so that the sound does n't leak out of your headphones , and refrain from any singing along except light lipsyncing . 
  * it 's ok to sleep , but please , for the love of god , do n't snore . 
  if you know you have a tendency to snore , stay awake as well as you can . 
  maybe have a cup of coffee . 
  * drinking is ok , eating is not . 
  we do n't want to see lettuce coming out of your sandwich , crumbs from your bread on the floor , or noodles from your chinese takeaway all over the place . 
  * do n't sit down unless you 're going further than three stops ( or are otherwise unable to stand ) . 
  * if you 're not talking to anyone actively , your expression should be relaxed and neutral . 
  do n't look excessively happy , angry , or sad . 
  * only bring small children on board if they are asleep or otherwise quiet . 
  do not bring strollers on at rush hour . 
  * if a person who is unable to stand comes on and approaches your seat , stand up immediately . 
  otherwise , everyone is allowed to stare at you for the rest of your journey . 
  * do n't look over people 's shoulders . 
  seriously . 
  * unless you are unable to stand or it 's rush hour , do n't sit next to someone , especially on the bus . 
  i had planned for this to only be three or four points , but it ended up being quite a lot longer than that . 
  hope you enjoyed this ~ ~ rant ~ ~ list of rules . 
  edit : thanks to / u/wideawakenotsleeping for this one : * do n't get on if other people are waiting to come out . 
  if you break this law , you should be tazed . 
  and that 's coming from someone who says nobody should have to be tazed . 
  i just contradicted myself . 
  solution : if you break this law , you are nobody . 
  god jul. 
  ( remember us ? 
  up here in scandinavia ? 
  we did n't really get involved in the war , but we still existed !, 
  right ? 
  right ? ), 
  do n't forget the handball world championships !, 
  ** norway ** * the women 's handball team was knocked out of the world championships after the quarter-finals , shocking most people , considering we had won the quarter-finals for the last nine championships * more devistating weather in western and southern norway . 
  lost of wind and rain , but now snow is also an issue in the mountains will definitely add more at some point . 
  this is just what i could think of right now . 
  our country is boring , y' know ? 
  ... but the adjective is still `` gresk '' . 
  heh heh ^ ^ # 5 is makedonia . 
  [ norwegian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a7kyw1b.png ) edit : # 5 is makedonia . 
  i now ofc have to make a `` what european countries are called in norwegian '' . 
  i 'm norwegian , so i understood the swedish but not the finnish . 
  edit : i took out the `` it 's funny because '' since i just now realized that it was n't actually funny . 
  sorry , do n't really know what i was thinking then . 
  wait , i 'm not done !, 
   [ svalbard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svalbard ) is possibly the most northernly permanently populated area on earth . 
  also , our empire is just as big as it was a hundred years ago , as opposed to yours !, 
  i 'm getting a terrible mental image consdering what , stereotypically , scotsmen do to animals when they are left alone ... 
  but we have penguins , too !, 
  [ see ? 
  ] ( http://4photos.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/photo-of-penguin-in-bouvet-island.jpg ) ^ 1 and scotsmen live on islands just north of them that are rightfully ours . 
  ^ 1 that 's [ bouvet island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouvet_island ) in the antarctic ocean . 
  nobody lives there and it 's entirely useless , but it means that the norwegian empire technically stretches all the way to antarctica . 
  ( not to mention [ queen maud land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_maud_land ) , which we can claim because we reached the south pole first . 
  and the north pole . 
  god , we 're awesome . ), 
  come look at the west coast of norway ,
