  denmark illegally pawned orkney and shetland off to britain under the condition that norway could buy them back . 
  britain refused to sell them back , so in that way it 's britain 's fault , but if denmark had asked norway first , this situation would n't have happened in the first place . 
  as for iceland and the faroes , when norway wrote its constitution and gained independence from denmark , denmark refused to hand over the islands . 
  and iceland . 
  and orkney . 
  meanwhile , the norwegian government has said we need to `` encourage environmentally friendly commuting and transport by building better bicycle facilities , including more cycle lanes '' for at least the past decade . 
  the street i live on has a cycle lane . 
  that 's a rarity . 
  the top 3 will stay there . 
  hoping sweden takes it . 
  albaina 's host looks like something out of the simpsons . 
  i bet sweden gets 12 points from every nordic brother . 
  i knew it . 
  i knew we should 've sent [ the pizza song ] ( https://youtu.be/l2bzb8utdo0 ) . 
  someone on the internet said that eurovision is not only about having the best song , it 's also about making a show . 
  that 's why sweden is one of the top candidates . 
  it 's why rybak won in 2009 . 
  our song is boring , and the stage show is nonexistent . 
  vi skulle helder sendt [ denne ] ( https://youtu.be/l2bzb8utdo0 ) . 
  probably in about fifteen minutes , and it usually lasts for about 45 minutes to an hour . 
  oh my fucking god . 
  whom else ? 
  in english : yeah , i 'm not voting for sweden . 
  i feel bad now . 
  i * wanted * to vote for you , but then you came at me with * that * . 
  [ i can top that . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/b3gehrenchc ), 
  goes to morrison 's 2 . 
  to buy salad 3 . 
  at 10:30 pm . 
  there is always at least one part of eurovision that makes me feel as if i 'm on shrooms . 
  i voted twice for sweden . 
  because yov5t . 
  and finland is n't even part of scandinavia . 
  quick question : how much does voting cost in your country ? 
  it 's 5 kr ( around $ 0.60 ) here . 
  sounds painful . 
  france has * hon , hon , hon , baguette , eiffel tower * . 
  italy has * ha , ha , ha , pasta , colosseum * . 
  the guy on the right is just cyprus ' entrant after he changed his glasses and came back on stage to start singing in italian . 
  theya coulda nota bea anya morea italiana . 
  exactly . 
  it 's as if the greeks were to boo germany 's singer just because she 's german . 
  although russia singing about world peace is ironic , to say the least . 
  can we please * not * boo russia ? 
  that 's as childish as greeks booing the german singer just because she 's from germany . 
  somewhere between modern ballet and a strange artsy porn film . 
  dammit , you austrians always stump me . 
  mortisha adams ? 
  go and grab a few beers , then come back and try to pay less attention to detail . 
  the only part of spain 's song that i got was `` mi corazon '' . 
  the rest was just `` ee-aa-ee-aa-oh '', 
  the fact that a frenchman is saying this makes me snigger . 
  romanian is closer to italian than anything else . 
  wait ... is this in english or romanian ? 
  please tell me this 'll be another gay vampire ballad . 
  poland , the entrant with an inspiring story and a crap song . 
  the svenskevitser just write themselves ... 
  itt : butts, 
  i spent half of montenegro 's entry changing into shorts because it miraculously reached 17 degrees in oslo and every house in this country is designed to keep the heat in . 
  what did i miss ? 
  certain parts of this song sound like the winner last year - which is a bad sign , because greece do n't really want to win , do they ? 
  * slow clap *, 
  nor is it even a room . 
  `` why do we have a green room ? '', 
  yeah , and why is it neither green nor a room ? 
  please tell me someone brought an extinguisher ? 
  why is the piano on fire * why is the piano on fire *, 
  prapapapably not . 
  country singers who are n't crossdressing ? 
  austria , have you learned * nothing * from last year ? 
  belgium and norway have the same costume designer . 
  also , some blow up kangaroos ... for some reason . 
  edit : and now venezuela . 
  anything is possible in straya . 
  you can ** not ** surf in a ** canal ** . 
  i had to look up that name before i realized that the face did , in fact , look familiar . 
  that 's when i realized it 's because he looks like every hipster ever , with an xxl nose . 
  i 'm pretty sure photosensitives know better than to watch eurovision . 
  time for a bathroom break . 
  * look at my nose , my nose is amazing ... *, 
  90 % of the times the hosts try to interact with anyone , it ends up being cringeworthy . 
  it 's fun to find interesting flags in the audience . 
  so far , i 've located lebanon , puerto rico , and the rainbow flag . 
  am i a terrible person if i say that the drawings behind the dude look like the guys in the ikea instruction manual ? 
  from ... literally everywhere where anyone tried to say anything negative about / r/fatpeoplehate . 
  are we done with the fat jokes now ? 
  can we move on ? 
  good . 
  now , we 're up next !, 
  promptly followed by sweden , both to rush through the nordic entries , and to completely destroy our chances of winning . 
  also hilariously resulted in the flemish and walloon broadcasters in belgium swapping hosting rights every year . 
  explains why you re-elected david cameron . 
  * building bridges ... *, 
  wtf ? 
  armenia had to change their song name because it might piss off the turks , * who are n't even participating ?!? 
  `` i 'm still in love with you . '', 
  that 's good to hear , now leave the stage . 
  you 're either completely wrong or suffering from the same fake hope you do every year . 
  wtf lights,
