  i realize this is a very british eurovision entry , but ... britain , whyyyyyyyy . 
  estonia : no , you can * not * into nordic , even if you give us all your points . 
  ... said nobody in the middle-east ever . 
  yup , i 'm bored . 
  number in the bottom left corner says this is entry # 4 . 
  none of them except israel and maybe slovenia were worth catching . 
  i voted for you . 
  it 's not the stig - but it is the stig 's bearded female cousin !, 
  is this why the norwegian word for city ( by ) encompasses anything from a small town to a metropolis ? 
  forget the song ( although it 's pretty good , too ) , i want to replace israel 's entry with a three-minute showcase of those shoes . 
  i can tell you that nothing has yet passed 4/10 on the `` crazy shit '' scale . 
  you 're really vienna bad sport about this . 
  let me guess : france was * awesome * last year , but ended up on like half a dozen points ; this year , they suck , but will end up in the top 10 . 
  gratz on that part . 
  this one sounded better on thursday . 
  that 's why i voted for you slovenia ; now dammit , show that talent !, 
  they could have trolled her horribly by putting a speech jammer through them . 
  as a minor , i can tell you it is actually fun to watch eurovision sober . 
  but none of you will ever listen to me . 
  can not unsee . 
  you ca n't hear it ? 
  ( i 'm assuming you 're in vienna ), 
  `` we can hear that graham norton in the neighboring commentator box is ready himself , too . '', 
  uk viewers : is he being loud ? 
  undeservedly , yes . 
  i have n't seen this many light bulbs over peoples ' heads since the first norwegians decided to look for oil . 
  i 'm surprised you only had two minor spelling mistakes in that comment . 
  then again , you 're german , you can probably handle that much alcohol . 
  i find myself awkwardly supporting sweden in this one . 
  that stage act is the shit .

  and even then , only the first verse is used at international sporting events and business occasions where you have to be brief . 
  actually , no . 
  after the reunification of germany the national anthem is , officially , only the third verse of `` das lied der deutschen '' . 
  the greatest victory austria has ever achieved , is convincing the world that beethoven was austrian , and hitler was german . 
  promaja , my lord , promaja ... ^ ^ ( sorry ), 
  well , you lost the napoleonic wars . 
  that was bad for us . 
  of course i know to look to both sides . 
  i 'm just saying : if there are * absolutely positively no cars coming whatsoever * , i have no reason not to cross . 
  `` i will have an allergic reaction that will make it seem like a fucking nuclear bomb is going off inside my body if i eat your food '' is that good enough ? 
  i was in amsterdam this past summer . 
  getting used to the bike lane was an experience . 
  the number of times i was two inches from certain death because i was walking in the wrong place is too high to count on one hand . 
  at least you dutchees are nice about it , though . 
  in copenhagen they shout at you . 
  why do you even bother with [ these ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7073/7021182953_8238aeb521_b.jpg ) ? 
  well , they do ... just ... not like that ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  does a government have time to be corrupt if it shows up late to everything ? 
  i do n't think so !, 
  ( insert entirely irrelevant reply about the iron curtain ), 
  actually , the table is neuter ~ ~ ed ~ ~ . 
  my elementary school teacher told us about queueing for the bus this way : imagine that you have a bottle of water to pour out . 
  now hold that bottle upside-down and see what happens . 
  water comes out , but it 's not very efficient . 
  now try holding the bottle at an angle . 
  you can get almost all the water out in no time at all . 
  it 's the same with queueing . 
  if everyone just stays organized , it can get done faster than you can say `` queue barger '' . 
   for about 350 days a year ah , yes , the glorious 15 days that fall out of this cycle that we nordics optimistically call `` summer '' . 
  sandals on and shirts off , time to go to the beach !, 
  preach that shit , brother !, 
  i 've also heard that the russians do n't have a drink to go with their meal ( alcoholic or not ) . 
  is that true ? 
  ** this . 
  this . 
  a thousand times this . 
  ** seriously , why the fuck ca n't you cross if there is * literally nobody for miles around ? 
  * for that matter , if you 're in the city and the crosswalk light is red even though there is n't a car in sight , why should that stop me ? 
  being from oslo , i have freaked out people from other parts of the country before by doing this . 
  [ relevant dara \u00d3 briain joke ] ( https://youtu.be/8yizolkstdm?t=1m20s ), 
  i , personally , do n't support the ban on religious symbols in french ( and italian ) schools because according to the principle of freedom of religion , you should be allowed to openly express your religious views within reasonable boundaries . 
  there 's no harm done in the occasional student wearing some sort of religious symbol . 
  good idea in theory , bad in practice . 
   ca n't stand ~ ~ the ( lack of ) queueing of ~ ~ the french . 
  ftfy, 
  this is why greece is in such deep shit economically . 
  not extremely common outside of europe , it seems . 
  especially when the outdoors looks like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mst8hu0.jpg ), 
  also true for norway . 
  in those cases you just wait outside the registers until someone shouts `` ledig kasse '' ( open cashier ) . 
  surprisingly well . 
  i 'm assuming you know how it works : you just pick a cashier beforehand and if another line goes faster , well , sucks to be you . 
  between 10:30 and 13:00 ? 
  sounds to me like that time will be filled with meetings and a short lunch break . 
  that 's true for norway as well . 
  basically all houses have a small room where the front door is . 
  this room has shoe racks , coat hooks , and maybe a closet . 
  this is where you take off shoes , coats , hats , gloves , scarves etc. 
  before coming into the house . 
  the british and their talent for queuing has always fascinated me . 
  also , your queue system in shops ( `` cashier x is open '' ) is brilliant . 
  but then they look at you funny . 
  and that 's even worse . 
  just a general scandinavian thing , i think : take your shoes off when you come in my house . 
  for christ 's sake , i just cleaned this place . 
  my god . 
  in norwegian , we do n't have * quite * that many of the * same * vowel in a row , but we do have * saue\u00f8yeeieren * ( the owner of the sheep island ) . 
  there are only 3 consonants in that 13-letter word , and 10 vowels , including 3 diphthongs .
