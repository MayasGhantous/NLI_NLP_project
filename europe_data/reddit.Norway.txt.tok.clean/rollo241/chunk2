   if the kinds of bulgarians living in norway ( if any ) are trustworthy , then a trust will be built . 
  sorry , it 's not specifically bulgarians though , it applies to * most * other countries outside of scandinavia . 
  a sweden or a dane are close enough culturally to be acceptable . 
  we have no particular feelings or ideas about bulgarians here . 
  i 'm not including the roma . 
   how realist is to keep your country isolated from globalization . 
  i 'm afraid you 've misunderstood slightly ; we 're already very `` global '' . 
  there are people from all over the world here in significant numbers . 
  we travel more than most and a lot of people study abroad . 
  however , our society was much more unified a few decades ago , when it was a * nation * and a state . 
   like foreigners pension funds helping supporting a big aging population yeah , except [ we 're the pension fund people ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/05/norways-pension-fund-to-divest-8bn-from-coal-a-new-analysis-shows )   the brain drainage from all eastern european countries ) yes , it 's hypocritical and we know it . 
  we 'd rather just have the few professionals we need , and not the masses of unskilled economic migrants . 
  we 're not that into eastern europeans by the way ; we recruit doctors from germany , engineers from portugal and nurses from the baltics or philippines . 
  thanks for replying . 
  yeah , you probably would have had another experience in sf or nyc . 
   my country is not super cosmopolitan . 
  hmm , that made me wonder !, 
  :d which country could it be . 
  i mean they all have large cities , do n't they ? 
  how did you end up in budapest ? 
   people willing to work can always find something have you ever been to my part of the world ? 
  - as an unskilled newcomer you wo n't get work in a shop or restaurant because they 'd rather hire people who actually speak the language fluently . 
  - you ca n't work in construction because they require a proper education ( vocational schools ) and at least some knowledge of local building techniques and materials ( wood ) . 
  - digging ditches is probably an alternative , if we actually needed manual labor for that ... 
  most of the jobs in this country are n't advertised , they 're found using networks or recruitment agencies . 
  you need to know people from school or an industry . 
  quite a few immigrants become entrepreneurs and create their own jobs , but that requires capital and skills . 
  we can only eat so much kebab !, 
   as long as the state does n't forbid it ( as is with asylum seekers ) . 
  no , that varies depending on country and the refugee 's status . 
  we grant temporary permits here . 
   and how do you expect them to get skills and to learn the language if they do n't work ?!?!, 
  it 's a good question , but we offer free language training and cultural introduction programs ( i.e democracy , women 's rights , laws and tolerance , blah , blah ) . 
   being a refugee does n't make you disabled and unable to work . 
  it actually does since you do n't speak the language for a long while . 
  unskilled manual labor jobs are few and far between , unlike the us where it 's far more common . 
  technically , we are descended from germanic tribes that migrated north . 
  the flag you showed was also the german anti-nazi resistance movement 's flag . 
  finally , northern parts of germany are formerly danish duchies . 
  what brings a latin american to germany ? 
   i do n't think there 's anything wrong with treating people differently as long as there is no discrimination for the fact that you are german living in finland or bulgaria , or any combination of expat and host country . 
  it is however fairly typical of many places . 
  if you 're bulgarian you 'll have trouble renting property in my country . 
  it 's not that we dislike you , it 's just a risk/trust level issue . 
  `` outsiders '' are treated differently . 
  it does mean you 'll experience real discrimination , but i 'm not sure it 's something you can change . 
  it certainly has changed my society in a very real sense ; the trust levels have fallen . 
  the kind of societal trust that researchers have documented and quantified . 
  it has meant lower costs for businesses and people since the trust levels were and are quite high . 
  it 's typical for societies where the people feel part of the same unit , and where the leadership is representative and less distant . 
  they have a taste for grilled * messerschmitt * dipped in * u-boot * ? 
  or maybe v2 hot sauce ? 
  japan has a taste for german cuisine ? 
  we typically eat it during the `` season '' ; i.e. 
  after lambing . 
  yes and no . 
  the saab group makes a lot of weapons and vehicles . 
  i 'm slightly surprised that they are n't more up to date . 
  the communists do attract many young people , but perhaps this organization is rather old and stale at the top . 
  i mean i can understand greeks being frustrated with the eu and imf , but to claim the eu is `` imperialist '' ? 
  technically , the fee is for * owning * a television receiver , not specifically for the national broadcaster . 
  yeah , i see that . 
  i 'm not sure the translation is the best , google does n't do norwegian very well . 
  i also read another article where they accused the local gov ' t of having given instructions to their ambulance drivers ; to drive the foreigners to the private clinics . 
  ah , yes , i 've heard about that . 
  hmm , must make things more interesting in italy . 
   thing is , that free service is only for those with an european health insurance card ( as mentioned here ) , ... yeah , they know this , it 's common for visiting/resident norwegians . 
  they have their own newspaper ( paper/online ) in spain . 
  here 's an article on a similar subject ( in norwegian ) : http://www.spaniaavisen.no/wip4/de-private-sykehusene-jakter-paa-nordmenn-med/d.epl?id=2553440, 
   italy has a lot of citizens residing abroad really ? 
  i did n't know that it was so common . 
  where are they ? 
  the us ? 
  ok , that may be the law , but that 's not what the scandinavian press wrote about pensioners there . 
  this was specific to the canary islands though . 
  in andalusia for example it works well . 
  i wonder if there 's any scientific basis for that claim . 
  i thought the weather systems came in from the atlantic . 
  ok , thanks , i was just uncertain . 
  i mean op 's comment was accurate , he covered [ implicitly resident ] citizens and residents . 
  it 's not that common to live in another country only to return for health care . 
  unless it 's the case in your country ? 
   it figures the rain which also affect temperatures and it seems like the mountains affect the winds enough to create rain . 
  the temperatures [ do n't vary much in norway , or at least not north/south ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8iqxl7j.png ) the map shows that the coldest places in norway are inland ( non-mountainous in the far north and mountainous middle ) . 
  the coast is wetter and warmer due to the sea . 
  wow . 
  yeah , i guess it always pays to have travel insurance . 
  well , the gulf stream is only part of it ; [ the rocky mountains air flow has a major impact on our climate ] ( http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/newsarticle/the_rocky_mountains_affect_norways_climate/1253979660187/p1177315753918 ) . 
  on the other hand i believe you were thinking about [ this effect of the jet streams . 
  ] ( http://www.skepticalscience.com//pics/jetstreamdiagram.jpg ) [ the jet streams ] ( http://skepticalscience.com/jetstream-guide.html ) seem quite a bit more complicated than just mountain ranges though . 
  this does n't quite make sense to me . 
  our mountains does n't block cool air as far as i 'm aware ? 
  northern and southern norway are not that different . 
  yes , but also the rocky mountains [ `` what do you mean , the gulf stream does n't keep europe warmer than north america ? 
  '' ] ( http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/2012/06/what-do-you-mean-the-gulf-stream-doesnt-keep-europe-warm-how-even-scientists-are-afflicted-by-urban-myths/ ) [ `` the rocky mountains affect norway 's climate '' ] ( http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/newsarticle/the_rocky_mountains_affect_norways_climate/1253979660187/p1177315753918 ), 
  yeah , and sometimes not even that when in spain ... or at least the canary islands ( ! ), 
  the ambulances literally drive you to the private clinics first . 
  orders or opportunity ? 
   ehic does not cover repatriation costs that 's one of the costs i 'm most worried about . 
  i always urge friends and family to double check their travel insurance covers that and more especially when going to countries like the us for example .
