  is that a joke or are you referring to returning citizens that live abroad ? 
  lichtenstein , norway and switzerland are also included in this thanks to the agreement between efta and the eu . 
  that does make it sound pretty bad though ? 
  does n't sound too charming . . 
  it 's a small world , 
  welcome to hell ( by vice ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrisnjevmfq, 
  what 's the joke or reference here ? 
   is this straight very swallow though ? 
  - [ swallow ] ( http://www.rspb.org.uk/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-88-34/6138.swallow.jpg ) or an act of swallowing something . 
  - shallow ; of little depth . 
  - straight ; moving uniformly in one direction only ; without a curve or bend . 
  - strait ; a narrow passage of water . 
   \u00d6rl\u00f6g ( same root as oorlog ) are you sure ? 
  the dutch word seems more complex after having researched it . 
  they 're both related to * urlage * ( primal law , i.e. 
  fate ) , but the dutch word seems different and more war-like . 
  ** dutch ** `` from middle dutch orloge , from old dutch * urlage . 
  in this word , two germanic words merged , both having the prefix ur - ( modern dutch oor and oer , with the former kept in compounds like oorzaak ( `` cause , driver '' ) and oorsprong ( `` origin '' ) , and the latter borrowed from german ) . 
  the first word was derived from proto-germanic * uzlag\u0105 meaning `` fate , destiny '' , with * laga - related to modern dutch leggen ( `` to lay '' ) . 
  the second word was derived from proto-germanic * uzleug\u014d meaning `` war '' , with * leug - meaning `` oath '' . '', 
  ** icelandic ** `` a separate , but related , concept is that of \u00f8rl\u00f6g . 
  according to an icelandic-english dictionary , by richard cleasby and gudbrand vigfusson , \u00f8rl\u00f6g means `` the primal law , fate , wierd , doom '' . 
  it comes from the old norse words \u00f3r `` out of , or from '' and l\u00f6g `` law '' with relationships to the word l\u00f6gr , meaning `` 1 . 
  water , liquid . 
  2 . sea '' . 
  the entire meaning is `` that which comes out of the law '' in this case , the law of the universe , or natural law and it also holds the concept of fluidity , like ur\u00f0r above . 
  another related word is lagr , meaning `` layer '' . 
  this gives us a better insight into how \u00f8rl\u00f6g operates . 
  it continually filters down to the past , in layers , from the present . '', 
  it 's from proto-indo-european ( pie ) . 
  i 'm sure you know this but [ it 's pronounced `` frede '' ] ( http://forvo.com/word/vrede/#nl ) , so it 's not exactly true that the dutch * vrede * means wrath in norwegian , 
  serbia ? 
  what 's that ? 
  you 're right , but then again he could be expressing his opinion independent of the graph . 
  as you probably know norway is part of the eea , schengen and [ the eu 's battlegroups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battlegroup ) , which means we 're like a member without voting rights . 
  while switzerland does have their unique bilateral relationship . 
  turkey only has the customs union . 
   but these are first languages with turkish being a second language from different language families . 
  yes , and that 's exactly what i described in the case of the 3-4 languages . 
  these are the primary languages of minorities such as the various sami people ( s ) , kven , finns in norway . 
   not danish to what norwegian is . 
  it 's also full fluency . 
  not partial fluency that 's a fair point , which i accept . 
  however , the above example ( see sami etc ) was meant to illustrate that its fairly typical to have multiple first languages ( major/minor ) in european countries . 
  no , as my generation is quite familiar with danish . 
  i suppose it helps that i vacationed in denmark a few times as a child , had some danish in-laws , worked for a danish company once , and most recently had danish co-workers . 
  then again i could say exactly the same about sweden/swedes . 
  you 'd likely get different answers from swedes/danes talking about their languages . 
  while their understanding of norwegian would be better/higher in both cases . 
  `` danskj\u00e4vlar '' is swedish , we 'd say * danskefaen * . 
   it does not include the various other languages of turkey that 's the case in many european countries . 
  we have plenty of regional languages , dialects etc. 
  i mean take my country for example , we have two written language standards [ of one language ] , 3-4 languages in all of norway ( unrelated families ) . 
  we speak countless dialects , and there 's no dominant standard . 
  we 're taught some old norse , icelandic , danish , swedish and sami . 
  while we easily understand swedish , danish , faroese , and some icelandic . 
  the only foreign languages we get credit for is english ( obligatory ) , and combinations of german/french/spanish / russian ( optional ) . 
  these days it 's typical to opt for spanish or chinese . 
   i found a norwegian pop song 's lyrics it was pretty cool , i understood their context just the understandable words felt as if they were horribly misspelt on purpose . 
  that 's because you 're comparing it with the wrong language  it 's more like * written * danish , but spoken like swedish . 
   90 % of the people are capable of holding a conversation in english just seems way to much . 
  it would n't surprise me if it was around that percentage . 
  i 've traveled around norway with foreign guests . 
  even in the smallest town/valley the local farmer speaks english well enough . 
  it may help that many farmers employ [ english speaking ] polish people , or have international guests staying on their camping grounds , etc. 
  another factor is our study patterns and i wonder if they 're similar in the netherlands ? 
  norwegians mostly study abroad in english speaking countries now , germany used to be the primary destination . 
  while our disposable income has lead to a well-traveled population . 
  these probably apply to the netherlands as well , but i wonder if our cultures are slightly different with respect to our own languages ' status . 
  frankly ? 
  never . 
  we 'll continue to speak many languages for the foreseeable future . 
  also what confusion ? 
  most people do n't cross a border on a regular basis . 
  did you know that there 's a theory that languages change how you think ? 
  some research even suggested it contributes to how people work and save . 
  germanic languages seemed to have an advantage along with certain asian languages . 
  we do however know that being multi-lingual is beneficial for learning and intelligence in children . 
  i doubt it ? 
  there 's no way they count towards foreign languages . 
  we may understand swedish and danish , but we hardly speak them fluently . 
  we do however learn english , german , french , spanish , russian , chinese or other languages in elementary , high school and beyond ( ymmv ) . 
  personally , i count english , french and german as my * foreign * languages . 
  i also studied some russian in high school . 
  while i studied spanish privately at a language school . 
  i guess that means i know 3-5 foreign languages ? 
  yes , but we had already established equality by law ( partnerships ) . 
  which is far more than spain had ... until you finally geared up !, 
   the difference of temperature and climate makes him physically ill , but there 's not much to be done about it apart trying to handle it ( acclimatization ) or moving some other place . 
  i believe u/napolandese is correct ( sunlight ) . 
  i doubt it 's the temperature/climate like you suggested . 
  have you heard of s.a.d. ? 
  you 're forgetting that this is the off-season . 
  they do n't usually cater to guests during the darkest period of the year . 
  there 's no need for such equipment otherwise . 
  right ? 
  oops . 
  fixed . 
   you can do this when the host society maintains the capacity to assimilate new arrivals ( with sufficient classroom space , language training , job assistance , housing assistance , and local community support ) . 
  you can not do this when an unending line of millions start showing up at your front door .
