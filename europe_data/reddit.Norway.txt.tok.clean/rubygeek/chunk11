  old english is english , middle english is english and modern english is english , and they all have the same point of origin . 
  i think we simply have different ideas of what it means to `` come from '' something in this respect . 
  we definitively agree that in terms of formal classification english is west germanic . 
  but the way i see it , modern english is the merger of large elements of multiple languages to the point that it is meaningless to say that it has just a single ancestor . 
  while scandinavian languages can trace a huge proportion of its core vocabulary to old norse , i 'd frankly be surprised if english can at this point even trace the majority of its vocabulary to old english , and a substantial proportion of its grammar is also imported , not least due to intentional attempts to apply latin grammar to english in the 16th century onwards , as latin was seen as substantially superior ( we find this influence in north germanic languages too , but it was to a certain extent tempered by our peripheral position - danish was the `` superior '' language spoken in norway for hundreds of years , and german often had that position in denmark and sweden - and in norway much of it was reversed in a the wave of national-romanticism ) . 
   most of the innovations you mention ( loss of case and gender ) were already happening long before the normans invaded . 
  there was a reduction in use of case and gender by the 11th century , but it was still extensively in use until well into the 13th century . 
  loss of gender in english was not complete until the 14th century . 
  see e.g. 
  richard m. hogg , david denison `` a history of the english language '' , cambridge university press . 
   english grammar did not ` mutate under influence from other language families ' . 
  it very obviously did , given that most of the early english grammars very explicitly set out to latinize english grammar . 
  it did so earlier too , but with respect to demonstrating influence from other language families the 16th-18th century shifts as a result of the process to formalize an english grammar are particularly well documented . 
   english does n't come from many languages come now ? 
  there are very few languages with such a culturally diverse history as english , and it has gained far more than a few words . 
  middle english is far separated from modern english , and middle english itself was far separated from the original anglo-frisian , and `` modern english '' itself spans a four hundred year long period with substantial changes to the english language . 
  where e.g. 
  modern scandinavian languages retain significant proximity to german grammar , english has mutated through successive rounds of changes influenced by other language families . 
  english under the normans gained logical gender from french , supplanting grammatical gender in the other germanic languages , lost most noun-endings , and word order gained a much greater importance than in the other germanic languages . 
  already by the time the norman rule came to an end , middle english grammar bore little resemblance to the other germanic languages , and large parts of the vocabulary had been replaced . 
  ( as a personal anecdote , as a norwegian , german grammar feels `` natural but old fashioned '' to me , while english has weird word order ; while it is often easy to translate * to * english because of e.g. 
  lack of gendered nouns , trying to teach my son , who was born in england , norwegian grammar is a pain because the grammar is so different ) and a large portion of the evolution of middle english into modern english involved further large-scale replacement of germanic vocabulary with latin-derived vocabulary from old french , coupled with conscious efforts in the early modern-english period to formalise a grammar for english based on latin . 
  the english of shakespeare , for example , is not the spoken english of the common person of the period , but using grammar that intentionally pushed english substantially towards latin ( and tried to push it further - the `` opposition '' to split infinitives , ending sentences with a preposition , double negatives etc. 
  are amongst the less successful attempts at latinisation of english from this period ) . 
  since the origins of modern english , english has had a second major wave of imported vocabulary from modern french , as well as large amount of directly imported latin words , as well as large numbers of imports from greek , arabic , hindi and a number of others . 
  absolutely . 
  though it 's actually a bit more speculative . 
  the most important reason apple does it this way is in case the us government at any point offers a tax amnesty . 
  since they do n't need the cash , and can invest it via a us fund anyway , there 's simply no reason for them to transfer the money back , and as long as there 's a non-zero chance that the government may budge and offer special concessions if they bring the money back , they may as well hold out . 
   foreign cash is mostlikely already taxed in the country where it comes from . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  if the subsidiary pays the money to apple in any way , it contributes to apple 's profits , and thus apple will need to pay tax on it again . 
  depending on how they 'd structure it , either corporation tax or capital gains . 
   the us says now , if you want to get money in the us , you have to pay taxes or you have to invest it . 
  the reason no tax is incurred is that the money is still legally the property of the foreign subsidiary . 
  so to the irs this is `` new '' money entering the us . 
  now , if apple inc wants to get hold of the money , the subsidiary would need to withdraw it , paying taxes on any capital gain while the money was invested ( to the us and/or the foreign country , depending on the applicable double-taxation treaty , if any ) , then pay out the money to apple inc , who would then need to pay tax on it in the us . 
  the reason they 're doing this is basically that the us government in the past now and again have given `` tax amnesty '' to get companies to bring money back to the us in the hope it will generate future taxes etc. 
  so since apple can reinvest the money anyway , and do n't need the cash , they avoid transferring it to apple inc as long as possible , hoping they 'll be able to take advantage of another tax amnesty . 
  i love meat , but i still kinda agree that meat should be more expensive , because i believe businesses should be made to pay for externalities . 
  if you contribute to environmental issues , you should cover the cost of dealing with it . 
  and the environmental issues with meat production are substantial . 
  franchises are individually owned businesses ( though some franchise operators will also own some of their own franchises ) . 
  franchise operators generally sells products ( e.g. 
  acts as a wholesale distributor of the food ) and/or licenses branding and other services ( such as staff training programs ; interior design etc. 
  - whatever they decide they want to ) , and charges for those services . 
  often there 's also a franchise fee independent of other factors . 
  so the franchise takers can get in trouble due to e.g. 
  not selling enough to cover rent , while still earning good money for the franchise operators by having to pay them for various services + the product . 
  of course that 's not a viable long term strategy - eventually those franchise takers either have to become profitable or close down and reduce the franchise operators revenues accordinly . 
  however some less scrupulous franchises speculate in continuously signing up new franchise takers rather than helping their franchise takers be successful . 
  edit : to be clear , this is the general model . 
  some specifics may not apply to mcdonalds . 
  mcdonalds does n't sell food to their franchise takers , but approves third parties the franchise takers can buy from . 
  mcdonalds is also peculiar in that they own or have long term leases on most of the property their restaurants is on , and charges the franchise takers rent - about 20 % of mcdonalds revenues are actually rental income , making them one of the largest commercial property businesses in the world , which have led to some investors pushing for them to spin out their property management into a separate company . 
  the funny is that most of apple 's `` foreign '' cash hoards do make their way to the us : their subsidiaries invest the cash via braeburn capital - apple 's own investment fund , based in nevada . 
  the money can be moved into the us without incurring us corporation tax . 
  it just ca n't belong to apple inc. 
  but apple 's investment fund can manage the investment of it . 
  apple inc. itself * also * invests its money via braeburn capital , and uses it 's position in nevada as another way of reducing us corporation taxes . 
  what he is n't telling you is that the party in question is a far right party ( which did not get anywhere near 20 % - rather 12.9 % - in the last elections ; they have polled better in individual regions ) , and in swedish politics the balance point is typically near the right wing of the social democratic party . 
  they are so far out of the mainstream that even most right wing people in sweden do n't want to deal with them . 
  apart from their anti-immigrant policies , there 's also been repeated controversies over racism and anti-semitism . 
  in 2015 they had to expel their entire youth organisation over allegations of extensive racism and connections to extremist groups . 
   israel have had to defend themselves ever since it 's birth of course they had to , given that pretty much every israeli leader since the state was founded have had their background in terrorist groups that murdered civilians in order to drive out as much as possible of the non-jewish population and try to force the british to leave . 
  the israeli state was founded by and with terrorism , and have since largely been run by terrorists . 
   proactive stance terrorism is a `` proactive stanace '' . 
  got it . 
   there are like definitions of words english is defined by usage . 
  there is no central authority defining the language , unlike , say , norwegian or french ( though in both cases they are often racing to keep up with usage changes to stay relevant ) . 
  in other words : if that 's how people come to use a word , that 's what it means , whether we like it or not . 
  est1roth gave you the most important details . 
  to add to that , i 'm a libertarian marxist , so would consider myself to the left of most of die linke , which is the left-most party in the german bundestag ... 
  sorry - i know it 's a bad trade . 
  what if we offer osborne as well ? 
  oh , and nigel farage ... 
  in general merkel is far on the other side of the political spectrum from me , but she 's one of very few right wing politicians i can actually respect - as much as there 's many things i disagree with her on , at least she seems to try hard to be principled . 
  i live in the uk . 
  anyone up for a trade ? 
  merkel for cameron ? 
  european countries deport to countries with capital punishment all the time . 
  just not people facing charges that might lead to capital punishment or torture . 
  and yes , when you draw up human rights law , it will also protect people you do n't like or would have preferred to get rid off . 
  tough . 
  that 's the entire point . 
  they 're human rights , not people-i-like rights . 
   why should the minimum standard include keeping dangerous people in western countries when they are not citizens ? 
  it does n't . 
  the minimum standard includes not handing people over to places where they will get killed , tortured or otherwise subjected to inhuman treatment . 
  a rather low bar , but one that many countries are unable to guarantee they 'll meet . 
  keeping some people we 'd rather not have around is a side effect of consider life inviolate , not the intent . 
  if there is actual evidence these people are a threat , countries are free to ensure they have laws to allow them to be detained . 
  the issue tends to be that despite media rhetoric there is n't usually any actual evidence . 
   made the age old argument `` criminals have human rights too . '', 
  yes , that being the very point of them being called ** human ** rights , and the very point of words like ** universal ** being in the title of the uns `` universal declaration of human rights '' . 
  we already have a vast number of laws granting additional privileges and protections that are not extended to criminals . 
  the entire point of human rights legislation is to set out the minimum rights that we want to guarantee for * everyone * no matter what . 
  the short-sightedness of those who wish to repeal human rights legislation just because they disagree with some of the protections given to people they do n't like always astound me . 
   when i pointed out there are actually terrorists and dangerous people people would downvote me into oblivion , call me a `` typical american '' that does n't care about human rights , or call me a shill . 
  plenty of us would still be tempted to use far worse words to describe those arguing against human rights laws .
