  and clearly it is n't if i have two . 
  in this case the emphasis is on whether or not i have any one of the class `` children '' , and i do . 
  but it gets more complicated . 
  if i stress the `` a '' , i could be making a statement about the other party 's choice of wording rather than the count . 
  it works best with additional context . 
  `` i do n't have * a * child , i have * many children * . '', 
  in this case `` i do n't have * a * child '' really means `` the choice of singular to talk about the number of children i have is incorrect and i wish to make sure to draw your attention to it . '', 
  it can also mean that the entity in question is special enough that referring to it as an unspecified `` a '' does not do it justice ( e.g. 
  `` i do n't have just have `` a car '' , i have a ferrari . 
  '' ; `` i do n't own * a * picasso ; i own * the * most famous picasso '' ), 
  the plural corresponds with `` any '' , not with `` women '' . 
  consider : * `` i do n't have any children '' vs `` i do n't have a child '' . 
  * `` they do n't have any children '' vs `` they do n't have a child '' . 
  the implications are slightly different , with the plural saying you do n't have `` any number '' of children , while the singular says you do n't have 1 , but does n't clearly rule out that you have more . 
  generally it would imply you do n't have * any * , unless there 's another limiting clause ( e.g. 
  they do n't have a child named john '' ) but it * can * also imply they have more ( `` they do n't have * a * child . 
  they have * five * '' ), 
  you would use the plural here because `` any '' implies a quantity that can be greater than one , and you want it to correspond . 
  you could say `` 20 % of all women do n't have * a * child , '' though . 
  the meaning in that case is subtly different , in that if you word it that way about something it is common to have more than one of , it could imply none or more than one ( though the phrasing is awkward ) . 
  exactly when any/plural vs. a/singular makes sense here is very fluid . 
  saying `` 20 % of all women do n't have a car '' sounds perfectly fine to me ( as implying none ) even though it 's normal to have more than one , and the other form works too . 
  depends where you draw the line on `` always '' and `` richest '' . 
  there are n't reliable gdp numbers going back more than a few decades . 
  depending on which estimates you look at , norway was below the west european average before either the war , or at or below the west european average before about 1910 . 
  from the 60 's onwards , sure , we 've been one of the richest not just in europe , but in the world , steadily gaining to the point where we 're now consistently in the top 5 and often amongst the top 2 . 
  but previously , in the period from about 1830-1920 , norway had the second highest proportion of emigrants to america after ireland due to drastic poverty and ongoing problems with food security and occasional famines ( and with the years of famine during the british blockade of the napoleonic wars fresh in memory for the older generations ) . 
  but the gdp numbers also obscures income differences . 
  most norwegian wealth came from forestry , fishing fleets and the merchant fleet and most people saw nothing of that wealth . 
  from [ long-run trends in the distribution of income and wealth ] ( http://ftp.iza.org/dp8157.pdf ) ( pdf ) by jesper roine , site , stockholm school of economics and iza ; daniel waldenstr\u00f6m , uppsala university and iza ( 2014 ) :  finally , the share of the top wealth percentile decreases significantly between 1789 and 1868 , both years predating norway 's industrialization period . 
  the share then goes up to slightly 1912 only to start decreasing again . 
  the most dramatic falls occur in the postwar period , with the top percentile dropping from 34.6 percent to 17.5 percent during 1948 -- 1983 and the top 0.1 percentile going from 13.2 percent to 5.7 percent over the same period . 
  ...  when merchant shipping expanded in the world after 1850 norwegian ship owners and manufacturers experienced a tremendous economic boost . 
  when looking at the average wealth of various occupations in 1868 listed in mohn ( 1873 : 24 ) , the four richest groups were manufacturers ( having 160 times the country average household wealth ) , merchants ( 124 times ) , ship owners ( 96 times ) and civil servants ( 87 times ) . 
  half a century later , in 1930 , a similar comparison between the wealth of top occupations groups and the country average was made ( statistics norway 1934 , p. 6 ) , and only ship owners had kept the distance to the rest of the population ( having 119 times the country average wealth ) , while merchants ( 22 times ) and manufacturers ( 19 times ) had lost wealth relative to the average norwegian wealth skyrocketed after the war and especially after the oil , but what made an even bigger difference than the gdp growth in the same period was that a large portion of the wealth went increasing salaries as well as to the state ( e.g. 
  in the form of special taxes on the oil industry ) and to expanding the welfare system in ways that massively redressed the previous levels of poverty . 
  the associated figure ( 14 ) in the linked pdf demonstrates how much the income inequality has dropped in norway , causing the increase in gdp to have a vastly higher impact in overall standard of living than the raw gdp numbers indicates . 
  in any case , the main point is the extreme multiplier . 
  depending on whether you draw the line we were somewhere between poor and middling by european standards , and went to competing for the spot of richest in the world , and almost certainly with the highest standard of living for a median household within a few generations . 
  why does that surprise you ? 
  it was business as usual for them to airbrush out all kinds of things . 
  as another example , gorbachevs early official portraints initially tended to have his port-wine stain [ removed ] ( https://josephliro.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/gorbachev-wo.jpeg ), 
  in this case , both claims are sourced on the respective wikipedia pages . 
  the book referenced in the wikipedia page about his mother [ can be found here ] ( https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xdzzqgijsicc&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lenin:+a+revolutionary+life.+routledge.+isbn+0-415-20648-0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=lenin%3a%20a%20revolutionary%20life.%20routledge.%20isbn%200-415-20648-0&amp;f=false ), 
  you can tell from the length that i 'm trying hard to avoid working on a project :d, 
  i guess whomever downvoted you did n't read the questions on the form . 
  i think for the americans we should replace one of those questions with a `` have you , or do you intend to , invade and occupy us for reasons of invented , non-existing weapons of mass destruction ? '', 
  norway is only infamous for its poor quality infrastructure amongst norwegians . 
  people tend to try justify to themselves why they deserve the wealth they have and poorer people does n't deserve to share it . 
  the alternative is to feel bad about it , and people in general are very good at creating a world view that makes us feel less bad about ourselves . 
  it 's human nature , i 'm afraid , and it has a tendency to make a proportion of wealthy people annoying as fuck . 
  i should probably have said that most people were poor , and not necessarily that we were extremely poor relative to everyone else either , but in comparison to norwegian wealth now the gap is much greater for norway than for most others largely because of our wealth now . 
  but a difference is that pre-war and quite far afterwards the wealth was much more concentrated , largely driven by exploitation of natural resources + shipping which was controlled by a * very * small number of families . 
  it was first well into the 60 's that the creation of the welfare state system had a substantial impact on redistribution and reducing poverty . 
  even so , depending on which of the sources you look at , the gdp into the 70 's we were below the west europe average , though not massively so . 
  we certainly did not deviate majority in terms of gdp in either direction . 
  i 'm not saying we had much starvation level poverty ( for that you need to go back to pre-1930 or so , where regular lack of food was one of the drivers that made norway the country after ireland to have the largest proportion of its population emigrate to america ) , but low enough that the increases in living standard coming in the 70 's felt drastic . 
  ( the threat of starvation is still present in the norwegian psyche , though - norwegian agricultural policy is still driven by a fear of food crises that dates back to the british blockade during the napoleonic wars ; there 's a reason other than literary value that the poem terje vigen for so long has featured so prominently in norwegian schools ) this is why the post-war governments were so totally dominated by arbeiderpartiet ( labour ) . 
  while some of this was possible to fund pre oil , the norwegian treasury receives something like 75 % of the oil revenues ( through a combination of extra taxes and ownership interests ) , and it 's the reason we can afford a welfare system like the one we have combined with taxes that are pretty average ( e.g. 
  when i moved to the uk , my tax burden remained pretty much the same ; compare to sweden that to finance their welfare system used to have the highest taxes in the world - leading to a famous incident when astrid lundgren pointed out to the finance minister that a tax rule change meant she 'd be paying 107 % income tax ... ) . 
  housing was one example where it was first massive housing construction in the 50 's and 60 's that alleviated . 
  my great aunt lived at enerhaugen in oslo through almost all of her life , and when the old houses there were demolished in the 60 's it was a break from tiny , cold , overcrowded houses without running water and outdoor toilets , to reasonably modern housing . 
  it was first into the 80 's that the last pre-world-war i housing stock in oslo had been upgraded . 
  you can see the change in norwegian movies from the 50 's vs. pre-war , where 50 's onwards the new post-war housing developments were being paraded . 
  i remember even as a child in the 70 's and 80 's how we went from looking at e.g. 
  tv and movies from the us with hugely aspirational amazement to it becoming nothing special as wealth rose . 
  norwegian culture from the 80 's was hugely influenced by how the living standards suddenly made it feasible for people to emulate america and going totally overboard with it . 
  young people these days ( oh , fuck , i 'm sounding old ; 41 is n't that old is it ? 
  ; i 'll go buy a pair of grandpa slippers now ) for example do n't tend to understand the emotional appeal of the whaling industry in norway . 
  part of the reason it mattered was that despite not being economically significant any more by then , well into the 80 's whale-meat was a cheap beef substitute at a time when the average norwegian could still not afford to eat much beef . 
  so we remember it as a treat . 
  it 's really disappointing . 
  it 's as if they live in this fantasy that norway is rich today because of their hard work , while the reality is that norway was poor until the oil money started pouring in , and we 'd have been on the receiving end of this kind of shit if we had n't struck it lucky with the oil . 
  i 've almost given up on reading norwegian newspaper because amount of egotistical whining is unbearable . 
  the change just in the last 20-30 years have been dramatic . 
  no , it 's no reason to import more . 
  but a few extra beggars is also not a reason to put restrictions on whole nations . 
  personally i 'd rather we prioritised getting rid of people who call other humans `` leeches '' . 
  ah , yes , there were no beggars in norway before ... ( that 's sarcasm , just to be clear ) . 
  make sure they have to answer similarly idiotic questions as on the [ i-94w ] ( http://www.immihelp.com/visas/sample-i94w-form.pdf ) ( pdf ) visa waiver form . 
  yeah , as a kid in norway in the 80 's i remember noticing that swedish tv had serbo-croatian broadcasts , as a result of the large influx of immigrants due to the swedish labour shortage in the 70 's . 
   they just compile the data afaik , the tax agency is who keeps track of were everyone lives and so on . 
  they are the ones i have to report to when i move anyway scb delivers statistics on much more than just where everyone lives . 
  such as immigration data . 
  that 's my point . 
  if you wanted to start collect language information , you would n't put that in the tax register , you 'd carry out surveys ( or include it in a census form ... )  i thought we did n't , that it was constantly updated ? 
  have any more info on this ? 
  the 2011 census was produced by taking a snapshot of the registers and combining that with analysis and spot checks to verify deviation , so if you meant that they do n't conduct a separate survey , then you 're for the most part right . 
  scb still produces a census , but the source material has changed . 
  the 2005 census was produced the `` normal '' way by having people return forms . 
  assuming the deviation shown in the spot-checks for the 2011 census was low enough , i 'm assuming they 'll continue using that method as it will presumably be far cheaper , though it has some very substantial drawbacks compared to a returns based census , disregarding any deviations , - most countries collects * way * more data than your tax register has for their census , and a lot of it ( including religion , ethnicity etc. ), 
  is information you wont ' t get without actually asking people . 
  a large part of the reason for doing that via a census is exactly that it is sensitive data that you want anonymised by someone who takes their job seriously ( e.g. 
  in norway , the census data is not just stripped of names , but they also do a lot of analysis to set thresholds for how small groups of people they can return data on before it is possible to reasonably `` reverse engineer '' numbers back to people with too high degree of accuracy ) . 
  in countries where it is tracked , the reasoning is that you ca n't eradicate biases and discrimination if you do n't have the ability to determine whether or not it is happening . 
  actually i find the article very peculiar , as it uses as an argument that tracking language would be a proxy for ethnicity , but statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n ** does ** at the very least track immigration background , which is a much better proxy for ethnicity . 
   we just do n't require people to report to the tax agency what religion they believe in . 
  this is n't about the tax authorities , but at about national statistics . 
  in sweden the natural organization to track this would be statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n ( scb )  and yeah , we do n't have a census or anything yes , you do . 
  yes , there have been at least 15 hijackings since 9/11 , only one of which resulted in major casualties .
