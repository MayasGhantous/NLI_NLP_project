  which one will top the list really depends on exactly how you define what the financial capital is . 
  ** city of london and docklands ** is the `` world 's financial capital '' of sorts . 
  the financial industry is in city because the uk has given them a massive amount of exemptions from rules that apply both elsewhere in the uk and elsewhere in the eu ( the uk opt-out from the working time directive , for example , is largely targeted at the legal and finance companies in part of london ) . 
  * despite that * e.g. 
  the london stock exchange is having problems staying ahead of the pack . 
  as it stands , london is not that unique , and it is only managing - barely - to stay ahead by basically surrendering to international finance based on the idea that some tax income from that industry is better than none . 
  with an exit , the finance industry is going to look at the pro 's and con 's , and they 're going to be demanding further concessions not to move to new york or frankfurt , for example , so even if it stays in london , the benefits of having it are going to further diminish . 
  norway still did n't want to join in '94 on a mix of protectionism ( one of the main `` no '' parties is senterpartiet - a party mostly representing farmers and people in areas dependent on massive farming subsidies ) , national-romanticism around the * idea * of norway as a self-sufficient farmer/fisher/hunter utopia ( and throw in some viking helmets ( ** without ** horns ) , and some [ grieg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3-offd7m3e ) playing while we eat [ freia milk chocolate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bvcrsiliiq ) while [ sailing up a fjord ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/adolph_tidemand_%26_hans_gude_-_bridal_procession_on_the_hardangerfjord_-_google_art_project.jpg ) and you get the full idea of norwegian national-romanticism ) that is irrelevant to the daily life of most people but still very much part of the national psyche , and the knowledge that we had/have an economy that is ridiculously strong thanks to the extremely high oil taxation , that made business concerns over remaining competitive much less of an issue in norway than elsewhere . 
  norway is basically one major economic crisis , and some more urbanisation away from joining . 
  it 'll happen sooner or later . 
   a huge part of people being opposed to the eu in the uk is n't the idea of it , it 's that it 's forced and undemocratic . 
  the irony is that most of the current structure of the eu is as it is as a workaround for problems that only exist because the eu currently is mostly structured like a confederation because it minimize the necessary constitutional changes required in each nation . 
  a full federation would allow for a much `` cleaner '' and more democratic setup , but would require constitutional changes in pretty much every member state that would be unlikely to pass yet . 
  compare the eu to the us in the years under the articles of confederation , and you see why many eu institutions and treaties are the way they are - basically created to have member states delegate powers from the executive and their parliaments that in a federation would derive directly from the people , because there is no legal basis for the latter without constitutional changes , but doing the former without the contortionism the eu has gone through results in crap like what the us endured in the early days where individual states just ignored or refused to fund decisions they did n't like . 
   force you to remove anything related to human rights from your laws . 
  the human rights point is that the british political elite are the ones that have done their best to undermine human rights legislation in the uk . 
  on both human rights and social issues and worker rights , the uk political elite ( including large segments of labour ) are far to the right of the prevailing attitudes of the eu . 
  if people vote for an exit , they 'll finally get to see just how much damage a tory government is capable of doing . 
  what we 're seeing now is a tory government with one arm tied behind their back due to eu regulations . 
   see e.g. , norway norway is in the eea . 
  we get the pleasure of implementing all eu directives without getting to vote on them , and get to pay the eu for the privilege . 
  norway is in many respects more tightly integrated into the eu than the uk . 
  norway is part of schengen for example , and implements eu directives into local law much faster than the uk . 
  if the uk tries to negotiate new agreements after an exit , eea membership would pretty much be the best case , but that would mean e.g. 
  accepting the same free movement of people etc. 
  that cameron has been trying to get exceptions from , and losing all say in what the rules are . 
  but the eu has been actively wanting to get rid of the eea for a long time - it 's a side-show for them that they 're not really interested in maintaining , since most of the old eea countries are now eu members ( there 's only norway and iceland left ) , so even getting the eea deal is unlikely . 
  that 's pretty much the tl ; dr of how the us civil war started, 
  but there are still people browsing on devices that are not modern . 
  germans did n't prefer nsdap . 
  nsdap never got a majority of the voters , and when hitler took power thy were worried about falling support . 
   true , but i would 've thought on the account that one guy filmed the whole thing that some sort of evidence was on it it seemed to me like the implication of the article was that she was probably not yelling for anyone to stop or screaming because she was terrified of what they might do . 
  part of the problem is that it can be very hard to conclusively see evidence of coercion on a crappy video , that may also very well have been edited , or filming may have started after she had already given up . 
  of course it could also be that the case was totally fucked up , but the biggest problem in general with rape convictions is that you can have cases where everyone seeing the evidence will go `` of course he/they did it , it 's obvious they 're lying , * but * what if he 's not ? '', 
  if we could trust every accuser to be 100 % honest and every accuser to get every aspect right , then it 'd be easy . 
  but there 's a very real rate of made up accusations or honest mistakes ( e.g. 
  mis-identification ; or flawed memory after a drug/alcohol filled evening ) that means the court system has to account for the fact that we do n't have a reliable way of telling with certainty if the alleged victim in question is one of the ( probably vast majority ) telling the truth , or one of the few that are lying or making mistakes . 
  modern legal systems are based on the principle that we should prefer 10 guilty people to go free rather than imprisoning even one innocent person . 
  the downside of course is that this means a lot of people do not get justice , and rape cases are heavily overrepresented in that respect because so much of evidence is limited to the testimony of the parties . 
  it 's hard to change that . 
  maybe one thing that will is increasingly advanced personal recording devices - we see idiots filming their crimes already , but conversely we should start seeing more and more cases of people being able to collect evidence when attacked . 
  until then , we 're stuck with a lot of people going free . 
  the age of consent is 15 on iceland , is it not ? 
  so he 's acting creepy , but he 's not been convicted of breaking any laws ? 
  that would presumably be the reason he is still allowed to be a lawyer . 
  as for the alleged gang rape , the problem with rape convictions in general is that it is very hard to prove exactly what happens when nobody else is present . 
  a lot of the rape convictions happens when the rapist is stupid enough to deny sex happened and is contradicted by evidence . 
  any rapist who spends even five minutes with his lawyer will tell as close to the truth as possible if there 's any chance at all of evidence , with the result that the case will unfold along the lines of `` yes , i had sex with her , but she begged for it ; the marks ? 
  oh , that 's because she 's a dirty slut and could n't get off unless i was rough with her '' . 
  then the problem is how you * prove * that is n't the case . 
  you need to consider that while this case sounds like it probably was rape , people * do * occasionally put themselves in situations like this consensually , and that makes it harder to prove that any given instance is not such a case . 
  rape convictions can never get high because the very nature of it means that a huge proportion of cases will come down to not whether or not you believe the accuser , but whether or not you believe the accuser with sufficient degree of trust to put someone in prison based on their word . 
  focusing on such a problem would involve doing actual research on the actual statistics and writing about the aggregate numbers , not pointing out ethnicity in individual cases , given that the press only reports a small subset of crime in general which by no means is guaranteed - or even likely - to be representative . 
  20 seconds of making up shit on reddit . 
  the end is nigh when not even the jobs posing for bnp election posters are safe from us job-steeling foreigners any more . 
  better watch out . 
  before you know it , some bunch of german troublemakers will be taking over buckingham palace . 
  i still do n't agree . 
  correctness is a sliding scale in languages , because understanding is in constant flux , and we can only really talk about it in terms of relative levels of accepance . 
  one of my favourite is `` begs the question '' . 
  i 've never seen the original usage of `` begs the question '' other than when pedants complain when people uses it as `` raises the question '' , yet at least as of a couple of years ago , dictionary usage panels were still deeply conflicted and leaning towards the original meaning . 
  depending on who who you ask , `` begs the question '' as `` raises the question '' will be either seen as correct or incorrect , or * both * uses will be seen as correct to various extents . 
  there 's also the hilarious gaffe [ when the bnp used a picture of one of the 303 squadron 's spitfire 's in an anti-immigration poster ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/04/polish_spitfire/ ) ( and then backpedalled like crazy ) . 
  those damn polish spitfire pilots , coming to britain to risk their lives while undercutting hard working british pilots ... 
  the comparison to vichy france is interesting because vichy france were run by french officials , though under severe pressure from germany , and continued directly from the previous french government . 
  vichy france was both de jure and de facto the inheritor of the third republic - the vichy government under petain was explicitly granted power to rule france by the french national assembly . 
  meanwhile , the polish government lost all control of all territories , and their territories were split three ways , between three government none of which recognised the name of poland , shared any government departments with the deposed pre-war polish government , or had any continuity of leadership , or recognised he polish language , or polish citizenships . 
  the two are pretty much as different as can be . 
   why would anyone care what someone so obviously ignorant thought ? 
  because ignorance leaves room for spreading these ideologies again . 
  what you are speaking to are arguments for why poland as a state still existed * de jure * ( by the law ) . 
  but said government exercised no power over any of the territory of poland , and said army was unable to operate pretty much everywhere in poland , and said civil society was drastically disrupted by mass expulsions , segregation into three separate regions and by sending large proportions of the population to concentration camps . 
  * de facto * poland had seized to exist : while large part of the world might still talk of a country named poland , there was no area where the government in charge recognised the name poland , and no country where polish was the official language , and no country that issued polish citizenship , or recognised it as theirs , and no country or areas over which the exiled polish government exercised control . 
  you 'll note that this is materially different from the situation in almost every other nazi-occupied country , that generally had a continued existence in some form , with continuity to the pre-war government structure to various extents . 
  poland was split in three : german annexed territory managed by the german government , soviet-annexed territory managed by the soviets , and the `` general governorate '' , which was a government set up and staffed by german nazis , and subordinate to the reich , but that very explicitly was a government structure that did not claim to be a successor to the polish government , but a government managing `` leftover '' territories after what germany declared to be the full collapse of poland as a state . 
  those leftover territories were meant to be ethnically cleansed to make room for german settlement . 
  they had poles declared stateless by german courts , and basicaly dismantled and erased the country . 
  afterwards , there was no state that shared borders with the pre-war state of poland , or that recognised polish citizenship , or that had polish as official language ( the general governorate that rules the remainder of polish territories had german as its official language ) , or that had any continuity with the pre-war government of the state of poland . 
  that 's * very * different from most other occupied countries that in most cases kept their borders mostly intact and in most cases had local at least notionally in control of various aspects of government ( and in some cases had local governments continue to operate semi-independently , like vichy france ) . 
  nobody would argue that e.g. 
  norway or denmark `` defacto did n't exist '' despite having nazi-dominated government strucures pretty quickly , because they retained their borders , their languages , their names , and had a continuity of government that lasted through the occupation and through to liberation - who was in charge of government changed , but the government departments continued to exist and functionally manage the same countries . 
  but in poland there was no continuity like that . 
  most languages , including english , are defined by use . 
  i 'd argue that most people would interpret `` cuban detention camp '' to mean a `` camp operated by the cuban government '' , and if so using that term about guantanamo would in fact be wrong , no matter what contorted argument one makes for it . 
  the problem , of course , is that none of us have conducted a survey to prove how people would actually interpret it , because ultimately that is what would determine which usage is right . 
  it 's slightly below half , if the list on wikipedia can be believed . 
  13 out of 28 eu member sates , and 3 non-eu states ( israel , switzerland and liechenstein ) . 
  does n't really change your point much - i was surprised it was that many countries for my part . 
   the fact is that having people arrested for expressing an opinion is the behaviour of a police state . 
  that 's why the us has a protection against it . 
  in the us too , there are well recognised limitations to free speech , including incitement . 
  generally the test is whether or not speech is directed to inciting imminent lawless action or likely to incite or cause it . 
  the line is blurry , because incitement often comes down to how seriously a given statement is likely to be taken by a given audience or context . 
  saying `` kill all jews '' in front of a group of jews would likely be protected ( though depending on how you do it , it might attract * other * charges such as disturbing the peaces or harassment ) because they 're not likely to turn on each other in murderous rage because some racist said so - there 's no imminent incitement or threat . 
  but chanting `` kill all jews '' repeatedly to a crowd of violent racists at the start of preparations for a demonstration outside a synagogue might very well be found to be `` likely to incite imminent lawless action '' . 
  i do n't know of * any * country where there is n't some sort of limit to speech on the basis of things like incitement . 
  absolutely . 
  and we should not forget that it 's a sentiment that in many development countries as late as in the last few decades has been applied to illegal political surveillance of many organizations on the flimsiest basis . 
  in norway , which is n't usually thought of as a political dystopia , what is now the police security service spent decades illegally carrying out surveillance against left wing groups that had never done anything wrong and never had plans to , because the post-war labour governments were terrified of soviet influence to their left . 
  ironically , the most serious spy scandals in norway have involved people connected to the labour party - which makes sense , because the norwegian labour party had power , the various communist , socialist and anarchist groups , whether willing to talk to the soviets or not , had quickly faded into obscurity after the war .
