  that may well be so - it is well understood that different modes of child rapes are culturally dependent . 
  gang rapes * are * dominated by non-whites . 
  conversely , paedophilia gangs are almost exclusively white . 
  it does n't alter the overall fact that the overwhelmingly largest risk to a child are the people with easy access , and that remains parents and relatives and friends of the family for the vast majority of children . 
   finally , having read the reports , it seems to me that these sorts of things are chronically underreported . 
  so is rapes by friends and relatives . 
  we know this from anonymous surveys . 
  i just think it 's worth countering some of these arguments because a lot of people who are n't racist also end up hearing just the one side of the story . 
  how exactly do you think this adds up to more than a tiny proportion of overall child rapes ? 
  ( hint : it doesnt ; gang rape in general is vanishingly rare compared to other rapes ) i absolutely agree with you that it is a problem that needs to be addressed and of course absolutely horrifying for the victims and teir families , but nothing you have posted shows it as being significant relative to the level of abuse and rape carried out by relatives and friends of the family , and so i stand by what i said originally , that parents should focus more on the people they * know * who they give access . 
  edit : since the downvoters are out in force : 7000 child rapes a year reported in england vs. 1400 over a 16 year period . 
  even with a reduced estimate of 5000/year , it 'd be 80,000 over the same 16 year period . 
  so , yes : tiny proportion , and downvoting does n't change that . 
   your attitude that boys are to blame is universal no , my attitude that boys are to blame is based on the statistics . 
  if research shows the numbers are wrong , i 'll revise my view accordingly . 
   so we can assume that 9 out of 10 times the kids are caught in the act the adult who caught them will blame the boy . 
  what an adult catching kids in the act might think is irrelevant as the gender split is not based on what they might think , but supported not just by police reports , calls to e.g. 
  child line by abused children , as well as anonymous surveys and decades of psychology research . 
  the numbers are extremely clear : when it comes to sexual abuse , men dominate totally for children as we do for adults , as we do for most violent crime . 
  when it comes to * overall neglect and abuse * on the other hand , women are actually somewhat worse ( largely explained by the difference in amount of time spent caring for children ) . 
  you also seem to imply that most of this is a matter of two kids of similar age being caught by adults , but this gender split is consistent ranging from brutal child rapes of infants by adults , through to `` nearly same age '' sex where there might be a question of whether the sex was actually consensual . 
   i 've heard countless stories of friends of mine who were male saying their first sexual encounter was with a 15 year old babysitter when they were in their early teens . 
  anecdotes are not data . 
  how many female friends of yours have admitted to being abused as kids ? 
  how many of your male friends have admitted to having their first sexual encounter with an older boy or man ? 
  because the stats are pretty clear that when surveyed about sexual conduct as kids , whether or not * they * saw it as abuse , the overwhelming number of victims are women so if you have `` countless stories '' from your male friends it means a large number of your female friends are not talking . 
  and the perpetrators overwhelmingly men , regardless of the gender of the victim , so if `` countless '' of your friends have had sex with their older babysitter , then far more than that will have had sex with older males , and are n't talking about it . 
  consider that you get to hear the stories that your friends are prepared to share with friends , and there 's plenty of research to indicate most sexual abuse victims rarely tell anyone . 
  unsuprisingly you get to hear stories about boys that had a sexual debut at a young age by the older girl - a recurring * fantasy * amongst many boys , and something that increases a boys status rather than reduce it . 
  yes , i 'm telling you that you 're naive if you think most of those `` countless '' stories are n't made up , and naive if you think the real victims have talked to you about it . 
  especially if your friends know that you hold the kind of views you 've hinted at here . 
   so with girls be coming sexually active younger and having a place of blind trust and a status of victim just makes them the perfect wolf in sheep clothing . 
  that may very well be true . 
  thankfully all research indicates that girls are so much less likely to abuse that blind trust in a female babysitter is still statistically a pretty good option relatively speaking . 
   of course the boy wo n't tell of his abuse since he liked it and probably want to do it again . 
  sexual abuse of boys by older girls still tends to have the same long lasting psychological impact as it does for other groups of victims . 
   so we can agree that not gender but age is the biggest factor in children abuse no , gender is by far the biggest factor . 
  when you consider groups of people with the same access and comparable age difference vs a child - namely mothers and fathers , or older siblings - the males are many times as likely to carry out sexual abuse . 
  the same holds true pretty much no matter how break it down . 
  i 'll also moderate what i said about fathers , because apparently there was an nspcc report back in 2000 which went into more detail and suggests that a larger proportion that previously believed might be older brothers ; how comparable that is to other numbers depends on exactly what was included in the sexual abuse definition used , but in either case male members of the immediate family dominate solidly on all measures i 've seen . 
   because it 's not blood fathers but step fathers who do the most molesting . 
  you are right that some reports have shown stepfathers to be * more * likely to carry out sexual abuses than biological fathers , but biological fathers still carry out sufficient sexual abuse that even if we break down family members by biological/non-biological , biological fathers still rank near the top of the list , though possibly eclipsed by older male siblings . 
  this makes sense in as much as for abusers looking for potential victims , single mothers are attractive targets . 
   so it goes back to feminism and their lack of respect towards the family unit and the well being of the child . 
  grow a pair of fucking balls and stop blaming women as if they 're the only ones causing breakups . 
  and as if they 're the ones that are likely to seek out vulnerable families looking for victims . 
  as a man it 's just sickening to have to read this kind of redpill crap . 
   1400 is a significant chunk of all child rapes in the uk and rotherham was but one of many found out pakistani-on-white gang rape operations . 
  rotherham was 1400 over a 16 year period . 
  in comparison in the 2013/2014 reporting period there were more than 22700 sexual abuse offences against under 16 's reported in england alone , of which about 7000 were rapes . 
  the number has increased in recent years , but lets assume an average of `` just '' 5000/year for the last 16 years , and that 's 80,000 over a comparable time period as the 1,400 rotherham cases . 
  so yes , as awful as it is , it 's still a blip . 
   i think it 's bullshit to say males are most likely to abuse their siblings . 
  it did n't say they were . 
  you are right that older relatives - including * older siblings * - are most likely to abuse younger relatives . 
  fact remains that dads and brothers are the highest risk factor for children . 
   but saying boys are most likely is just inflammatory feminist propaganda . 
  no , it is statistics . 
  edit : [ here are some numbers that indicates ( us numbers ) 14 % of abused boys and 6 % abused girls reported a female perpetrator ] ( http://www.victimsofcrime.org/media/reporting-on-child-sexual-abuse/statistics-on-perpetrators-of-csa )  now i am really disgusted you call for people to be suspecting of fathers but damn mothers female cousins and daughters the hard facts is that females account for a vanishingly small proportion of sexual abuse , which is what my comment referred to . 
  women account for a similar proportion of other abuse , but e.g. 
  violence is much less of a crime of opportunity - few people seek out kids specifically to hit them . 
  this part bears repeating over and over :  but as a child you 're still more likely to be abused by someone you know . 
  specifically , according to the nspcc , the most likely persons to sexually abuse a child are the father or brothers , close male relatives and close family friends . 
  basically : the easier unsupervised access someone has , the more likely they 're to abuse . 
  scandals like rotherham are horrible , but in numbers it 's still a tiny blip , and parents worrying about their kids should not focus on strangers , but focus on who has access unsupervised and make sure the kids understands what behaviour is and is n't safe - even when coming from people they know , such as friends parents . 
  i 'm not suggesting we tell kids to be scared of their friends parents , but that they e.g. 
  should be taught to always make sure ( first hand ) that their parents know before going off with someone even if it 's someone they 've seen their parents be friendly with . 
  as a dad myself , this frustrates me as i all the time see parents clearly give me and other dads an automatic presumption of being safe that they have no basis for , and teach their kids the same by example . 
  of the kids in my sons class at school , for example , i 'm sure a substantial number would happily walk off with any number of the dads of their friends because their parents have focused on strangers instead of focusing on what behaviour is unsafe . 
  the problem with that , of course , being that most abusers will have kids . 
  it 's pretty much sugar/caramel . 
  it 's not even a real cheese - it 's caramelized whey . 
  it 's one of the few norwegian specialities i think brits might be reasonably likely to enjoy . 
  it 's one of those things pretty much none of us actually * eat * but we like bringing it up around foreigners to see if we can make them uncomfortable , along with lutefisk and going into detail about how we like to eat bambi and what whale steak tastes like . 
  [ it 's brutalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutalist_architecture ) coupled with post-war austerity . 
  there are some very cool brutalist buildings , but brutalism + low budgets tends to be a total disaster , and a lot of brutalist housing tends to be frowned upon now not just because of dated appearance , but because they tend to not be `` human scale '' , with too many units packed too tightly set around public spaces that tends to be intentionally austere and imposing . 
  it was popular because it was based around ideas of essentially engineering perfect , orderly cities , and because the use of simple , bare , unadorned concrete fit perfectly in for people tasked with rebuilding vast amounts of living space after the war with little money . 
  oh so very convenient then to be able to plop down some cheap and ugly-as-shit box and insist it was modern and functional . 
  edit : for an illustration of how extreme brutalism can be , one of the most famous brutalist architects - le corbusier - competed both for a redevelopment plan for moscow and for a new building for palace of the soviets , right in the middle of stalins rule , and he lost out to more conventional architects in both cases . 
  even the stalinists found his designs to austere and harsh , and instead [ aspired to neo-classical architecture instead ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neoclassical_architecture ) ( though that was for monumental buildings and for the wealthy - for mass housing projects brutalism still had the benefit of being * cheap * ), 
  my suggestion is they get to keep it on the condition they keep all the mps too . 
  so in other words we 've established that you 're using a definition of `` radical '' that places them in the same group as some of the most peaceful people around who rarely pose a threat to anyone . 
  then what is the point of applying that label again ? 
  so like the amish , then . 
  dangerous radicals . 
  european court of justice is not the court of last appeal for the echr , and ecj does not have jurisdiction over switzerland anyway , so what the ecj feels about it is not particularly relevant to a swiss law . 
  also , the specifics of the laws will matter greatly , especially with respect to article 14 . 
  edit : so the case related to france at least actually was in front of the european court of human rights , not the ecj , and the ecthr * is * the court of final appeal . 
  [ this article at cnn covers it , but the idiot journalist linked to a file on his hard-drive for the claim so i 'll look elsewhere for exactly what claims she made ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/01/world/europe/france-burqa-ban/index.html ) . 
  that does not mean the swiss law will escape scrutiny , though , and without looking at exactly what she claimed , and reading the court decision it does not automatically mean this law will survive the same treatment . 
  it sets a much higher upper limit on fines , for example , which may affect how reasonable the court would find it . 
   they create little subcities computer simulations of habitation patterns have demonstrated quite conclusively that it takes fairly extreme views to ** avoid ** the creation of `` ghettos '' . 
  the reason is that a lot of patterns of thought that we consider quite reasonable implicitly leads to `` ghettoisation '' . 
  the problem is that most of us will avoid areas where we are in a distinct minority , and `` area '' is not clearly defined : we may be happy to move into a building without anyone of our own culture because we see some similar faces in the surrounding area , or we may be happy to move into an area that seems entirely foreign to us if we move into a small enclave with people similar to us . 
  now , if you distribute people * entirely * randomly , you are bound to get enclaves of people that some others will prefer not to move into , but that people similar to those in the enclaves will be ok with . 
  iterate over that over time , and ** even if ** not a single person ever even remotely think about specifically looking for places where they can live with people like themselves , and you will get more and more and larger areas inhabited by people of the same culture . 
  it requires a reasonably large subset of people to * actively prefer * to move into areas where they are under-represented to break this up . 
  we see this sometimes , such as when an ethnic group has been economically weak and portions of them are improving their situation , such as with black people in the us moving into `` white '' neighbourhoods , but overall it only happens if the areas where people are moving too have something desirable that these people can afford . 
  couple this with socio-economic differences that excludes most immigrants from large areas , and what you describe as `` subcities '' are pretty much mathematically and economically inevitable even without any intent . 
  want to solve this ?
