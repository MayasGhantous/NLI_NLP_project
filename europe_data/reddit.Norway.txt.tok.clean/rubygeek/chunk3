  my searches only turns up `` to shelter '' for bergan in old dutch ; more closely related to `` berge '' / `` bergen '' in the meaning `` rescue '' than to any words i can find indicating fortified place or hamlet . 
  can you point me anywhere that gives fortified place or hamlet for it ? 
  again , `` burg '' , `` burch '' , `` burh '' is what i find for fortified place/hamlet or similar , quite unambiguously across old saxon , old frisian , old english , old frankish , old german , old dutch ( via old frankish ) , old norse , from proto-germanic `` burgz '' . 
  in any case , `` bergan '' comes from proto-germanic `` bergan\u0105 '' . 
  the meaning of that is quite wide , and the proto germanic comes from the pie root * b\u02b0er\u01f5\u02b0 - - to rise , height , hill , mountain ... 
  this is the same pie root as the proto-germanic bergaz , from which we get `` berg '' ... 
  this pie root is also where aforementioned proto-germanic `` burgz '' comes from too - basically anything `` fortified '' or `` shelter '' ultimately comes down to being higher than the surroundings ; this is fairly universal . 
   similarly , in english place names we have lots of - brough , - borough , - burgh , - bury , all from the same old english root meaning `` a fortified enclosure '' . 
  the `` old english '' in this case being `` burg '' or `` burh '' , which appears to have nothing to do with the dutch `` berg '' or `` bergan '' other than sharing the same pie root much further back . 
  for bergen , norway it 's a very clear direct link to berg ; in norwegian the equivalent of `` opbergen '' is `` oppbevare '' , which is related to norse `` bevare '' or middle low german `` bewaren '' ( . . or dutch ) , so it 's not been anywhere closer to `` bergen '' than that . 
  we also have `` berge '' as a verg for `` to rescue '' / `` to save '' , but there 's no interpretation of that which fits with trade . 
  i 'm curious about this one . 
  i 've only found three sources for the etymology of the name - [ encyclopaedia britannica ] ( http://www.britannica.com/place/bergen-op-zoom ) , which appears to be the source for all other mentions i 've found bar two ( usually without people bothering to cite it as their source ; but most are reciting it word for word ) . 
  this claims it comes from mountain/hill . 
  the other being [ history today ] ( http://www.historytoday.com/elka-schrijver/bergen-op-zoom-stronghold-scheldt ) ( paywall , but you can see the start of essentially the same etymology as britannica ) . 
  the remaining source i 've found is `` an authentick and accurate journal of the siege of bergen-op-zoom '' printed 1747 , which is also claims it is mountain/hill , though is not very credible ( it claims the etymology stems from danish , which makes no sense when the same meaning of the word exist in dutch ) and then goes on to make shit up based on latin ( there are at least two other books published in 1747 about that siege ; i have n't checked if either of the ohters carries a different etymology ) . 
  i 've not found any mentions at all of your etymology . 
  i 'd be curious if you have a source for it . 
  it 's plausible , and it 's not like britannica is citing sources for their etymology for it either ... 
  the strongest argument against it i can see appears to be that the rise of bergen op zooms fortunes a a trading centre postdates the founding of the town by several hundred years . 
  that does n't have to mean much , of course ; just as it does n't take a big hill for people to drag out `` berg '' it might not take much trading activity to use that as the basis for a name either . 
   we do n't have hills you most certainly do . 
  even denmark has plenty of hills , and you have more height variation than denmark . 
  it does n't take many metres difference before you start finding names that refers to it . 
  and you have several names that are very explicit about it . 
  berg en dal - `` mountain/hill and vallley '' - in gelderland - as well as several villages on the [ plateau van margraten ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plateau_van_margraten ) that rises up to about 100m up over the meuse valley . 
   actually the name `` berg '' means something else in old-hollandish : small village . 
  that sounds a strange . 
  are you sure you 're not thinking of `` burg '' ? 
  all the sources i have found agree that `` burg '' in old dutch unambiguously is the same word as `` burgz '' in proto-germanic , that has the same form ( `` burg '' ) in pretty much every germanic language other than the scandinavian ones , where it became `` borg '' ( but you still find `` burg '' in the english versions of some city names - e.g. 
  gothenburg but g\u00f6teborg ) , and that `` berg '' likewise unambiguously is the same word across the germanic languages , from an entirely different root . 
  if you have a source to the contrary , i 'd be very interested in seeing it . 
   hillegersberg on the contrary , the name hillegersberg stems from a legend that the giantess hillegonda dropped sand from her apron , and hillegersberg was according to the story founded on the mound of that , so `` berg '' in that is one of the ones that most unambiguously refers to mountain or hill ( of sand ) . 
  [ the coat of arms of hillegersberg even depicts hillegonda pouring sand ] ( http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=hillegersberg ) ( incidentally , i had to look this one up , but actually remember fragments of this story from primary school in norway ; i 'm certain the legend was brought up as an example of other legends of giants outside of norse mythology ), 
  it 's not as weird as it sounds . 
  berg in most or all germanic languages has a shared origin in proto-germanic `` bergaz '' meaning both * hill or mountain * , and in most germanic languages it 's retained a somewhat ambiguous meaning that might imply a mountain but might also simply imply a rock-mass or hill without indicating anything about height . 
  i see netherlands , like e.g. 
  norway , have plenty of places named `` berg '' something or other because of hills rather than mountains . 
  if you have valleys , you have hills , and hence plenty of `` berg '' . 
  in fact in norwegian , `` berg '' is still very commonly used for pretty much any larger rocky mass or hill that is * not * a mountain ( for mountain we usually use `` fjell '' ) , whether it is tall or not . 
  e.g we have the word `` svaberg '' for a rock-face that 's typically partially submerged in the sea and eroded rather than rising far up ( in which case we 'd call it `` fjell '' ) . 
  as another example , the danes calls the little hill that they long thought was their tallest mountain `` himmelbjerget '' ( `` sky mountain '' ; `` heavenly mountain '' ) . 
  though i guess in their case they may have been deluded enough to actually have considered it a mountain ... norwegian and german at least also share berg/berg as simply a large `` heap '' or `` pile '' of something in some contexts . 
  my `` favorite '' is when someone is starting some project to do something with technology in africa , and the threads are instantly full of `` they need clean water and food first , and most of them do n't have electricity anyway '' . 
  never mind being home to several of the worlds largest cellphone operators etc. 
  i 'm also very much anti-religion , but i do n't see the current muslim refugees as much of a threat in that respect . 
  while some of them will push for more religious concessions , many of them do n't , and many of them have shared interests with secularists in removing christian special privileges . 
  i live in the uk , where your odds of getting a top education is substantially higher if you 're baptised in the catholic church , slightly worse but still better than nothing if you 're an anglican/protestant , because of the system that has allowed the rise of a large number of discriminating religious schools . 
  i 'm sure you 'll find one or two . 
  but according to eurostat , the average number of children per woman in the uk is still dropping . 
  [ according to hmrc ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/255526/chb-geog-aug11.pdf ) ( pdf ) :  the number of families with one child has increased each year since 2003 whereas the number  of families with more than one child has been in general decline over the same period . 
  changes  in the size of families in receipt of child benefits could be due to qualifying young people staying  on in education or just a reflection of the general rise in birth rates over the same period . 
  the  average number of children per family for which child benefit is paid has reduced each year since 2003 roughly , by eyeballing the graphs , 6.5 million families had 1 or 2 children in 2013 , compared to a bit under 1 million with 3 children , and well under half a million with four children or more . 
  from the later tables , the number of families receiving child benefit , by number of children : * 1 child : 3,720,160 * 2 children : 2,940,120 * 3 children : 902,250 * 4 children : 236,890 * 5 children or more : 85,340 of course , not nearly all of the ones in the top categories are immigrants . 
  but yes , you 've probably seen some . 
  they do , however , make up pretty much exactly 1 % and * dropping * of the overall number of families in the uk . 
  in particular related to this trend it is worth noting that immigrant families tend to revert to the birth rate of the host nation in about a generation , so any influx of large families tends to not have much of a long term effect , contrary to the fear of some that expect immigrants to come and multiply like rabbits and crowd everyone else out . 
  the reality is that once the net immigration from a country slows down , the population relatively quickly reaches near steady state as their influenced by the low european birth rates . 
  the fact that you are lumping dozens of countries with cultures ranging from quite liberal multi-ethnic , multi-religious to fundamentalist extremists like the wahbists together into one group is enough to demonstrate that you 're blinded by your own hate and not interested in actually bothering to learn about these people . 
   for a secular and more or less prosperous europe . 
  europe has n't been secular for several thousand years . 
  we have had a trend towards more secularisation for the last half century or so , but even abolishing blasphemy laws is something most countries have first done or started considering in the last couple of decades . 
  my hunch is that it 's 90 % people just being uncomfortable with people they do n't know and understand with no clue of the actual risks , and 10 % shitty neighbourhoods . 
  go to poorer areas , and you will run into plenty of socially mal-adjusted people . 
  of all races . 
  however , black and asian people are severely over-represented amongst socially deprived groups in the uk for various reasons ( for starters because a substantial proportion of them are immigrants or refugees with a poor starting point ) , so go to a poorer areas and it 's easy to get racial stereotypes confirmed . 
  but if you then go find some specifically white-dominated poor areas , on the other hand , and you 'll quickly find that it 's exactly the same there . 
  the issue is social deprivation , not immigrants vs. `` natives '' or what ethnic group or religion they belong to . 
  of course , most poor people are perfectly nice people too , but if someone is a totally socially mal-adjusted person who is unable to function in a normal environment , odds are they 'll end up being poor , on welfare , and giving everyone else a bad name . 
  and these are also the people who have the time to hang around and make people uncomfortable . 
  that 's a good point . 
  i 'm norwegian . 
  first time i visited austria , we found it really bizarre how people were constantly going gr\u00fc\u00df gott to us , and we had to really consciously make an effort to say it back , as it was clearly most of the time just said as a standard greeting , while to us it felt like constantly being on the receiving end of people pushing religion on us ( though we of course understood that was n't the intent ; on the contrary people were being extremely friendly and polite and accommodating ) . 
  i live in london , in croydon - one of the most racially mixed locations in the uk - and does not recognise any of that . 
  i 'm white , my ex is black . 
  our neighbours are racist white british nationalists . 
  yet everyone get along just fine most of the time - even the racist nationalists next door are always polite and friendly ( to our faces , anyway ) my ex regularly gets approached by obnoxious men that do n't know how to talk to women , and guess what ? 
  even here , in a borough with far more than average immigrants and non-white people , the majority of people hassling her are still white british . 
   my wife is blonde , i have to pick her up from work every day and loose 30 minutes of my time because she was whistled at and approached by some arabs . 
  she is really scared now . 
  and she 's never been approached by white men ? 
  my ex was hassled by white british men all the time in london . 
  areas are different , and i 'm not ruling out that there 's a problem where she works , but to think that this is an issue specific to arabs is putting on blinkers and ignoring how things have been for much longer than there 's been muslim immigration to europe . 
  anecdotes are not data for good reason : they 're biased to the extreme ( and that equally means that i also do not have the true picture based on what i see - it goes both ways ) . 
   they are 100k now , but the women are bascially child-carriers . 
  the more kids you have the more money you get in some countries . 
  well , here 's the good news for you : we have a long enough history of immigration from places with higher birth rates to know that once immigrants settle in a new country , their birth rates adjust to at or near the host nations birth rates typically within a generation ( 20-25 years ) . 
  that might sound long , but consider that the average family will already be some years within child-rearing age , and often have had some or all of the children they will have already , and so this timeline basically mostly mean that children of immigrants have children at nearly the same rate as average in the community they settle . 
  immigration also tends to upset family dynamics and tends to on average delay child rearing within those couples who do not already have children . 
  as for money , i do n't know if you have children , but for my part i do n't know of any country in europe with a policy generous enough to make having children profitable in any way . 
   i see some in their 30s with like 5 kids , so how many of them will be there in 10 years ? 
  if they 're already in their 30s , the answer is the number wo n't grow much on average , and once their children are old enough to have kids , as mentioned above , their kids are likely to have children at the average rate , which means the number will slowly increase until it reaches an equilibrium once the parent generation starts dying out . 
  consider norway , where immigration from pakistan saw the bulk of young men come to work early in the 70 's , and then it was reduced to mostly family reunions ( e.g. 
  people marrying and bringing spouses over , or bringing parents etc. ) . 
  of the current pakistani immigrants to norway , the majority had arrived by 1989 . 
  since then , the number of people of pakistani descent in norway has roughly doubled , and has now mostly stabilized , as the first generations of immigrants have had children , and some of their children have started having children , but some of the parent generations have started dying . 
  a reasonable answer to your question , then is that if there 's 100k now , then in 30 years time maybe they and their descendants and close family will add up to ~ 250k , and the number will be pretty much flat at that level given low european birth rates which they 'll be adopting , and slowly subsiding as they 're mixing with the current population . 
  of those , about half will be born in your country and have grown up learning your language and customs , and will generally be quite well integrated to the extent that for a substantial proportion of them , they 'll mainly be different due to skin colour . 
  on top of that , of course , comes any further immigration ( unrelated to family reunions ) . 
   is n't it better to think now than in 20 years where everyone will be so radicalized that it will be a bloodbath ?
