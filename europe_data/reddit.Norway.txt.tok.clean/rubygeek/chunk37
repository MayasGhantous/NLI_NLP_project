  consider that already the communist manifesto spent a whole chapter denouncing other socialist ideologies ranging from `` utopian '' to far-right reactionary forms ( people trying to combine socialism with feudalist political structures ) . 
  i have never in my life seen police estimates for a demonstration that are n't far below what everyone else thinks . 
  no matter the country . 
  police as notorious when it comes to giving low-ball numbers for demonstrations , just as organizers often over-estimate them . 
  it 's pretty much business as usual for there to be a factor of 2-3 difference between police and organizers ' estimates . 
  the difference being that those of us who e.g. 
  want redistribution to end poverty do so because we see the poverty itself as immoral or unnecessary , not to appease people threatening violence - the violence you are talking about is an effect , not a tool used to push for change . 
  as such it 's an entirely different situation . 
   nasser himself was a figure charismatic and smart enough to counter islamist opposition . 
  unfortunately , each of his successors were less talented and more corrupted . 
  i agree . 
  this is one of the big problems when such parties end up personality focused - they may have good runs , but sooner or later some idiot gains power . 
   by the way , it 's interesting , that only arab countries , which were - and are - relatively free of toxic islamism , are moderate ( at least partly constitutional ) monarchies - jordan , morocco , oman ( although in this case different kind of islam plays a major role ) , maybe also kuwait . 
  i think this is largely a result of survivor bias : the bad monarchies ended up outmaneuvered by one or more of a colonial power , secular opposition or islamist opposition ( and if the former two ousted or turned them into figureheads , then that fed into more support for islamists ) . 
  left are the ones that proved able to navigate politics sufficiently well to prevent tensions from getting high enough to favour extremism . 
  jordan came to be by rising up against ottoman rule , and then aligning with the british , but were fairly good at holding back internal tension for example by expelling british elements from the jordanian army . 
  compare to iraq , where the king faisal ii , a cousing of king hussein of jordan , let himself be too much of a british puppet and ended up overthrown by the ba'athists as a result . 
  also look to the arab spring , where king abdullah ii of jordan responded quickly to domestic unrest by replacing the prime minister and making a public show of ordering the new pm to draw up a reform program . 
  i have not followed how successful it is , but the act itself does imply a monarchy that understands that its survival hinges on being prepared to take quick steps to allow enough reform to make continued struggle undesirable for the time being . 
  you see the same in the uk for that matter : uk history is a history of monarchs that were more willing to accept that they had lost another fight and surrender a bit more power rather than risk tensions reaching the kind of level where one might find oneself with ones head detached from ones body like their counterparts in france . 
  as an example of the 30s-60s period , [ here is former egyptian president nasser in the 50 's ridiculing the muslim brotherhood for wanting to force women to cover up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx4rk8bj2w0 ) . 
   unfortunately , it was 1 . forced from the top , 2 . sometimes merged with `` arab socialism '' . 
  which lead to islamists being core of anti-authoritarian opposition in countries like iran or egypt . 
  in iran , it took cia involvement to get the islamists on side before the shah gained power , and the liberal forces and islamists quickly got back to fighting the same fight against the shah , so it 's a bit different , though islamists certainly formed part of the opposition . 
  iraq and syria are perhaps better examples , in that ba'athist ( socialism merged with arab nationalism ) parties took power both places ( the assad family and hussein 's parties were/are both ba'athist ) . 
  nasser in egypt , linked to above , of course certainly did not make friends with the islamists . 
  at the same time , it 's worth considering that religion is often incidental in these power struggles : early parts of is came from members of husseins security apparatus looking for a new power base . 
  some portions of these groups care deeply about religion/ideology , but a lot of the people at the top only care about the power . 
  this is a recipe for getting people to opt for violence to get society to bend to their will . 
  the problem being that when two sides use violence for conflicting reasons , bending over for the first ones to use violence will not solve a thing . 
  your translation is fine . 
  a couple of places where it shines through that you 're norwegian but nothing more than minor nitpicks . 
  you might be surprised . 
  you 're probably right about major cases , but most countries have specific simplified procedures for small claims . 
  in slovakia that applies to claims for up to eur 1000 . 
  [ according to this document from the world bank ] ( http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/670181487131729316/pdf/112769-wp-p161975-public-fasttrackingsmallclaimsineu.pdf ) , court fees for a small claims filing in slovakia for a claim of eur 200 , is eur 16.50 , and it can be resolved by written procedure if the case is simple ( that is no need to show up in court unless asked ) , and no lawyer is necessary . 
  the point is not that you 'd have been guaranteed a win , because as you point out you did n't have much evidence ( but you could point out that you bought a package that 'd be totally pointless if you were told it did n't cover the country you travelled to , and that could be persuasive ) , but that having you file a claim and having to respond costs a large company many times more than paying out on a small claim like this , and * sometimes * - certainly not always - that will make them pay out rather than risk having to pay their lawyers for it . 
  it wo n't always work , but next time something like this happens , try just * saying * that you will sue and see what they say . 
  you 're not bound to go through with it . 
  and even if you do , * your cost * is the court fee ( which increases for larger claims ) . 
  i appreciate that it might not be worth it to you , but in your place i 'd have found the 16.50 worth it just to piss them off . 
  it 's a national sport almost everywhere . 
  i 'm norwegian , and i cringe every time i read norwegian online news sites - the comment sections are full of people describing norway in ways that 'd make you think they 're describing iraq or afghanistan right after the invasions . 
  i live in the uk now , and it 's the exact same here . 
  including turning on any foreigner that dares to complain with even 1/10th of the force of the locals . 
  i do n't know if you have the equivalent of a small-claims court , but you probably do in some form : most places this is a court that will handle claims up to some low monetary value , and where you can appear without a lawyer . 
  usually the filing fee is very low . 
  figure out if you do , and next time something like this happen , do n't threaten but ask to speak to a supervisor and gently inform them that you are considering taking the case to court . 
  the thing is , for a small claim like that , the cost of even having a lawyer look at the case will cost them more than the claim itself , and while the supervisor may not have authority to cover the claim to avoid a case , chances are whomever is triaging claims in the legal department does . 
  worst case , you may have to consider whether to follow through or not , and whether or not it 's worth your time and possible loss , but the effort and risk in small claims courts is tiny compared to for a bigger claim . 
  also : only do this if you 're prepared to deal with them cancelling your customer relationship . 
  but it 's worth figuring out what the rules are in your country , as just mentioning the right phrases can make them decide it 's easier to just pay out . 
  threatening with social media can make a difference too . 
   i would n't say `` ich bekomme ( ein/e ) krankheit/hunger/kind '' , i would say `` ich werde krank/hungrig/vater '' , interestingly `` werden '' is `` to become '' in english . 
  i am curious what exactly the process has been there . 
  in both norwegian and english ( despite `` become '' in the latter ) , you can not easily `` become '' hunger , because we 've lost an easy way of expressing of `` taking on the state of being hungry '' , and `` hunger '' in any case simply comes across as too severe . 
  probably because as it turns out that 's a very awkward thing to say . 
  i 'm guessing that transition is what 's happening in german too . 
  i 'm wondering if there might be a shift in how people think about these things . 
  hunger or disease or having a child no longer as strongly defines a lasting transition , perhaps . 
  in norwegian , the word for hunger is the same as , and mostly used for , starvation these days . 
  and there it is an abstract state that is hard to apply to an individual . 
  we say `` det er sult i afrika '' ( `` there is hunger in africa '' ) , but we would n't say `` jeg har sult '' ( `` i have hunger '' ) , and `` bekomme '' definitively does n't work there . 
  we can say `` jeg har * en * sult '' ( `` i have * a * hunger '' ) but as in english that has an entirely different meaning . 
  if you say `` jeg er sulten '' ( `` i am hungry '' ) it implies you 've missed a meal at most . 
  if you want to say you are affected by hunger , you pretty much have to say that : `` jeg er rammet av sult '' ( `` i have been affected by hunger '' ) - it 's an abstract , remote state that is something major but distant . 
  one of norways most famous novels , by knut hamsun , is called `` sult '' ( `` hunger '' ) , and already then ( in 1890 ) it very strongly implied a state much more severe than e.g. 
  having missed a meal ( the novel was a semi-autobiographical description of his descent into near-madness due to hunger ) . 
  this is pure speculation , though . 
   `` be '' is not a state change , it indicates that whatever verb it 's applied to is focused only on the object/subject that it focuses on . 
  some sources say it is both , some says it 's just the latter . 
  though it could be fair to argue that the `` transition/change of state '' effect in the cases where that is present is simply a consequence of changing the focus of the verb , though . 
  other than bekommen ( er ) leuchten vs. beleuchten might be a suitable example , though i 'll admit my german is failing me with respect to the exact distinction there , but it 's an interesting one because it 's example where the `` be - '' prefix is still used norwegian ( lyse vs. belyse ) too . 
  in norwegian this has a very clear distinction between focusing on something/someone directing light onto something else vs. focusing on the change of state to being illuminated . 
  specifically if you look at the past tense , the change in meaning is very substantial : jeg har lyst p\u00e5 saken '' ( `` i have directed a light at the thing '' ) vs. `` jeg har belyst saken '' ( `` i have illuminated the case '' ) . 
  the later can imply a lasting change of state , whereas the former in general can only be assumed to refer to a temporary act of lighting something up for the dureation of the period the phrase refers to . 
  but i do n't know how precisely this distinction maps to the german ? 
  my experience is that everyone will * try * unless you 've done something to offend them , and most will speak passable english , but it really helps if you know some basics , both because even people who are perfectly happy to speak english to you tends to get excited or pleased when people at least * try * to speak their language ( do n't underestimate how far above and beyond some people are willing to go as a result of small gestures like that ) , and every now and again you come across words people do n't know , and your odds of explaining things then increase substantially if you can switch back and forth . 
  while i 'm sure you 're right , i wanted to point out that this is largely a technicality and a matter of historical accident and how entrenched a specific prefix + root pair has become , and to a large extent demonstrates how arbitrary we often end up making these separations ( not that there are any good alternatives , really ) . 
  while `` bekommen '' today does not look like an obvious extension of `` kommen '' , it is basically the prefix `` be '' in the sense of `` state change '' applied to `` kommen '' in the sense of `` something coming to you '' . 
  you `` receive hunger '' =  you are hungry . 
  you `` receive a child '' =  you have a child . 
  you `` receive a cold '' =  you have a cold . 
  it largely seems odd today because the entrenched nature of `` bekommen '' has led to those senses in the specific meanings being `` carved out '' as exceptions . 
  you see this more clearly if you look at the massively confusing mess you get when translating kommen to e.g. 
  english , where you can end up with at least a dozen different ways of phrasing it depending on context to capture the full meaning , and many of those overlap directly with bekommen . 
  with respect to how far fusing words can go , e.g. 
  consider that the one surviving example of `` bekommen '' in modern norwegian is a * phrase * that has become fused into a single unit for all intents and purposes - that is , to a modern norwegian the phrase is interpreted as individual words is meaningless : `` vel bekomme '' . 
  basically `` receive well ! '', 
  when used to invite people to start a meal , or `` well received '' when used to acknowledge when someone thanks you for a meal . 
  for those of us who know both norwegian and german , this hints at `` bekommen '' both in the sense of receiving something , and in the sense of food `` sitting well '' . 
  but `` bekomme '' itself is so archaic in norwegian now that many dictionaries do not even include it any more . 
  as a result , the meaning of the phrase can no longer easily be derived from the individual words for most people who use it . 
  it 's just `` one of those things we say '' . 
  interestingly , in the example given by gp , the word that have supplanted `` bekommen '' in the sense of `` receive '' is `` motta '' , which is in the same boat of being a composite of another verb ( `` ta '' =  `` take '' ) and the prefix '' ( i ) mot '' which implies something coming towards you/meeting you . 
  so `` motta '' pretty much means `` take in a meeting '' in sense of someone meeting you and willingly handing you something , while `` ta '' on its own imply you unilaterally decide to take something . 
  so similar , but also very different . 
  `` mot '' / `` imot '' in this sense comes from norse . 
  while on one hand treating these words as separate often makes sense , understanding how they are composed often gets you very far in understanding words you do n't know in a foreign language , so it is worthwhile understanding their relationship anyway . 
  and since you brought up the distinction between e.g.
