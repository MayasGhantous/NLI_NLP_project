  most of these people fled the extremists because they did not agree with them . 
  syria , for example , was a moderate multi-ethnic and multi-religious society ( they even had a small remnant jewish community descending from jews that escaped persecution in europe and found refuge in syria ... ) before the civil war gave isis a foothold . 
  syrians are also literate at above the world average . 
  and they are used to a legal system that draws heavily on french law . 
  of groups likely to cause integration issues , syrian refugees are quite far down the list . 
  want to avoid your local muslim communities getting radialised ? 
  step 1 , crowd out the more conservative groups with syrians and refugees from other moderate places ; step 2 , engage with them and treat them with the same respect as you would treat others . 
   `` they 're not in a war zone , i saw their smart phones . '', 
  well , since when does war make people automatically lose their smart phones ? 
  i think this is a particularly idiotic one these days . 
  not only will a lot of people in these war zones still have made decent money before things went to shit of course , but these days you can pick up new smartphones down into the $ 30 range , and used ones much cheaper than that - it might still not be cheap for everyone , but it 's not like it 's an impossible luxury anymore in all but the very poorest countries in the world . 
  people seem to not yet have adapted to a world where even many african countries are in a situation where the majority of adults have cellphones and a rapidly increasing percentage of those are smart phones . 
  peoples image of poverty and war zones basically seems to be lagging several decades behind reality . 
  you 'll find that in quite large parts of europe it is quite common for schools to ban skirts above knee level because it 's considered against their christian morality , so this would seem to imply affording muslims similar levels of influence to the one that christians have `` always '' been afforded in europe . 
  moves to secularise schools in europe is only 10-30 years old in most countries in europe , with plenty of large exceptions to allow for outright religious schools in most countries still . 
  note that i do n't like this . 
  i 'm not suggesting it 's good in any way to have religious groups interfere in schools . 
  i grew up having to have my parents sign special exemptions to have me taken out of christianity classes in school in norway in the 80 's - there were typically 5-10 of us in a whole school out of several hundred students , as even most kids who might have non-religious parents or who might themselves doubt were intimidated with being singled out like that . 
  mainstream schools were blatantly favouring christianity , and still are . 
  on top of that , we had private schools that were more seriously christian ... 
  it was not a good system , and it wo n't be by mixing more religions into it . 
  i 'd rather see religious morality kept entirely out of it . 
  but it 's ridiculous given the amount of religious interference in schools in europe from christians to expect muslim groups to sit idly by and not push to have their views heard too in areas where they have sufficient representation to be heard . 
  ** especially ** in cases like your example , where muslim and christian groups are likely to agree , and you 'll find little opposition from parents against preventing schoolgirls from wearing short skirts . 
   those two i would put in the more right wing category because they offer choice . 
  in contrast to ( extreme ) socialism/the left , where everyone is equal but has no choice that seems more like a right wing policy . 
  liberalism started left of centre . 
  later libertarianism was first coined by a french anarcho-communist , and then championed by the socialist league , an organisation supported by friedrich engels and eleanor marx ( modern day right-wing libertarianism is well over half a century younger than left-wing libertarianism ) . 
  the left/right division originally very clearly had mostly christian moralist parties on the right as support for the church and support for the monarchy were closely linked . 
  the centre has shifted to the left since then , but still today most liberal parties in europe are in the centre in most countries . 
  libertarian parties have generally fared very poorly in europe in the last century , and these days are mostly found as niche parties on both the left and right ( left wing libertarians will generally identify as belonging to a range of ideologies such as anarchism , anarcho-syndicalism , left communism , libertarian marxism etc , while right wing libertarians are more likely to just refer to themselves as libertarians and tend to get angry and confused if you mention left-wing libertarianism ... ) . 
  the main distinguishing factor between left - and right-wing libertarians tends to be the view on property rights , not moral issues . 
  being for abortion rights has also been very closely linked to feminism and womens rights , which has generally been a big deal for left wing parties . 
  euthanasia is trickier because there are many angles to come at it from - e.g. 
  personal rights vs. various abuse scenarios vs morality - that often unite people that otherwise would n't usually agree . 
  do you want 10 % chance of russia listening to international opinion on their actions , or 0 % chance of russia listening ? 
  ( repeat as many times as you like with different countries ) the point of including everyone is not that it 's great , but that the alternative is worse : a bunch of loose cannons acting unilaterally first without even trying to debate things first it 's the more militant or oppressive governments you should be most concerned about keeping in the un , because they 're the ones that we need moderating influences for . 
  nobody gives a shit if , e.g. 
  sweden were to go off on their own , because they 're not going to go off invading their neighbours ( any more , any way ... ) . 
  we do on the other hand give a shit about trying to at least somewhat moderate russia , and that requires inviting russia over to play even if they keep annoying us . 
  as much as i usually detest merkel , i do n't think she 'd be impressed . 
  if there 's any world leader i 'd love to see in a one-on-one showdown with putin , it 'd be merkel . 
  i imagine putin taking his shirt off and tryin to appear threatening with some martial arts moves , just to have merkel grab him by the ear , look at him with a look of severe disapproval , and scold him until he starts crying . 
  norway handed over old navy ships to a nigerian warlord a while ago . 
  he * promised * not to use to for anything other than civilian contracted coast guard duties ... 
  he soon afterwards threatened the candidates in the presidential election with possible war , lost the contract after the election as the guy that won was one of the ones he 'd threatened . 
  the irony of the lack of due dilligence was great when a norwegian commercial ship was held up and effectively forced to pay bribes to be let go by one of the ex-norwegian ships not long ago ... 
  so clearly the solution is simply to paint the equipment a `` non-military '' colour and sell it off for `` civilian '' use and everything is ok . 
  i mean , even norway who tends to have a quite sickeningly hypocritical holier-than-thou attitude to weapons sales considering we have a major international weapons manufacturer ( it 's all good as long as you 're not planning to commit genocide with the weapons * right now * ; wait at least a little bit ) , have decided that 's an acceptable method so it must be ok . 
  if someone were to forget to remove the weapons platforms etc. 
  that would just be an unfortunate oversight by some low level bureaucrat . 
  china in general tends to oppose anything that establishes a precedent for more frequent interventions in what they see as the internal affairs of other countries , unless there are substantial strategic benefits for china . 
  basically they know full well that they are pushing the limits of what is acceptable to the international community with e.g. 
  tibet , their relationship with taiwan , as well as their various border disputes , including their creative land grabs in the south china sea . 
  most others would have gotten much more severe responses as it is , and china gets off lightly because of its size and power , but they 're still dependent on e.g. 
  good trade relations etc. 
  and that requires maintaining a certain level of international standing to prevent it from being too easy for anyone to paint them in a bad enough light to create support for stronger reactions . 
  ensuring they maintain a consistent record on non-intervention , and ensuring they have sufficient number of people who owe them one , both factor into keeping their public image sufficiently balance to let them get away with the things they consider important . 
   why are you talking about terrorist attacks ? 
  it 's not about the terror attacks , it 's the simple principles of islam that i take issue with . 
  you wrote :  or maybe they do n't want a wife-beating , ** infidel killing and blow-shit-up ** backward religion . 
  my emphasis . 
  that 's why i continued to talk about terror attacks in particular . 
   taking everything else aside , i think the main issue people have with islam is : kill those who do not convert . 
  except that does n't apply for the school of islam that the vast majority of syrians adhere to ( nor , in fact , a long laundry list of most of the other muslim countries we receive most refugees from ) , which in fact explicitly see blasphemy and apostasy as private matters for the individual . 
  the unwillingness of large parts of the population to accept the extremist beliefs of isis is a large part of the reason for the magnitude of the refugee crisis . 
  syria has plenty of problems beyond just the civil war , but religiously it has always been a moderate and tolerant place , with multiple religions co-existing side by side . 
  including small remantns of groups of jews that moved to syria to flee religious persecution in europe over the centuries ... as well as a sizeable christian minority . 
  if it genuinely is extremists killing non-believers you have issue with , the that is one more reason to help those who are fleeing exactly the type of extremists you 're taking issue with . 
   then why bring it with them , like the others have done like and before them all over the eu . 
  people are individuals . 
  there will always be troublemakers that want to exploit the opportunity , and they need to be dealt with . 
  but there 's no indication that most of them * are * bringing it with them : since 2010 , there has been 12 terrorist incidents in the eu ; of those 4 were `` homegrown '' non-muslim terrorists ( if we look at longer timespans , europe had lots , especially in the 60 's through 80 's ; thankfully most of our `` own '' terrorist groups have mellowed or stopped operating over the years ) . 
  in the same time period , basic demographics means that ca . 
  37 million people died in the eu countries of all causes ( including old age ) - so over this period 1 in * one million * deaths are were due to terrorist attacks . 
  150,000 people died on the road in the eu in the same time period ; about 11 million from cardiovascular disease . 
  in fact , you 're * more likely to be killed by lightning * than to be killed by a terrorist in europe . 
  even if by taking in more of refugees we somehow increase the number of terror attacks a hundred times over , it would still only bump terrorism up to the equivalent of 2.5 % of the number of deaths from car accidents , or 0.03 % of cardiovascular disease . 
  or start to make it `` competitive '' with lightning . 
  of course that 's not much consolation to anyone affected , but it 's also so little that it would be pretty much a rounding error . 
  and there 's no historical precedent to justify a multiplier of 100x or anything near it . 
  basically , the terror attacks are insignificant , and we should treat them as such . 
  anything else is giving the terrorists more attention and notoriety than they deserve . 
   europe of 19th century would have done . 
  and that worked out so well for us ? 
  europe spent substantial parts of the 19th century with multiple large wars concurrently . 
  only to do worse in the 20th ( both in number of conflicts and size ) . 
   the isis thing to eu-west is what barbarians were to roman empire . 
  the isis thing is a minor scuffle compared to what europe has gone through every few decades for hundreds of years . 
  as an atheist marxist , i 'd be perfectly happy if most europeans actually lived according to the new testament , as that 's to a large extent a socialist ideology . 
  but realistically , european values is more about brutal oppression with the consent and support of the church , in contradiction with most principles espoused by early christians . 
   if you knew christan moral code you would find out that you have an obligation to protect your nation first , that does n't even make any sense : while the concept of nation states is fluid , and there are some arguments to be made for * some * ancient states such as egypt could qualify as nation states , the * idea * and concept of nation states is much more modern , and certainly was not common or widespread until hundreds of years after the rise of christianity . 
  to the extent that this has been vowen into christian morality * in some countries * , this is a case of secular ideas being adopted by * some * sub-groups of christians , rather than a case of some universal christian morality . 
  you mean what most of the current wave of refugees are * fleeing to get away from * ? 
  which form of sharia are you talking about ? 
  sharia is not a single system . 
  without defining which form of sharia you are referring to , answering that question is impossible . 
  syrians , for starters , are used to a dual system based in large part on * french * law , where most criminal and commercial matters are judged in accordance to legal principles very familiar to many europeans , and where mainly domestic / family matters are judge under hanafi law - one of the most liberal school of muslim jurisprudence . 
  hanafi is amongst others notable for insisting that blasphemy and apostasy is not something the state should legislate , but a personal moral issue . 
  which frankly is something many european countries should have learned from much sooner .
