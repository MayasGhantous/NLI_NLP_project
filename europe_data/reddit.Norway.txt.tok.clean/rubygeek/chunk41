  even russia is subject to the echr ( stop sniggering ... ) theresa may have implied in the past she 'd like to leave , but currently she has too small a minority - she can expect a large rebellion if she were to try taking the uk out of coe . 
  they can continue blaming the eu for decades . 
  `` the evil eu wanted to punish us for leaving and gave us bad terms '' . 
  `` the evil eu are interfering when they demand the stuff they 're buying for us follows their requirements ; pesky customers for being demanding '' . 
  `` horrible eu refuses to pay enough for our goods - they just want to see us fail '' . 
   the nazis enjoyed overwhelming public support in the years leading up to the war there are no reliable polls past 1933 and until the war ended , because the opposition was quickly outlawed and/or eradicated , and the use of violence and arrest to silence anyone not showing support for nsdap was extensive already in the last `` free '' elections prior to the passing of the enablement act . 
  even in those last elections , where most of the communist candidates had been arrested or threatened , and with extensive violence against the opposition , the nsdap did not get close to a majority in parliament . 
  past that point there 's basically no reason to believe any polling numbers , as the nsdap were in fully control of the count , and voting against put your life at risk . 
  as such , while there are a couple of people who have speculated that the nazis were wildly popular at the time the war started , i 'm not aware of any reliable evidence for it ( nor is there any reliable evidence to show they were not ) . 
   wow , thanks for the long post . 
  trying hard not to do any real work   this does not hold for tog right ? 
  actually , it probably does , of a sorts - we have to expand the rule slightly , i think , to include not just words where the divergence point is proto-germanic , but also words that arrived in norwegian from middle low german via hanseatic traders . 
  bergen in particular was a major hansa port , and the scandivian languages ( as well as finnic and baltic languages ) do have notable remnants of middle low german . 
  `` tog '' has the additional confusing factor that it has multiple meanings that are related in several languages yet that seems to have arrived in norwegian via two separate parths ( same in swedish with `` t\u00e5g '' ) . 
  tog has an archaic meaning close to `` raid '' or the modern norwegian `` tokt '' ( `` vikingtokt '' =  `` viking raid '' ) - you can find remnants of this meaning in modern norwegian in words like `` korstog '' ( `` crusade '' , literally `` cross raid '' ) . 
  this apparently comes from middle low german , and goes back to proto-germanic * tugiz , which is also the proto-germanic source of zug . 
  as far as i can tell `` tog '' in the sense of `` train '' likely is a case of someone seeing zug , trying to decide how to make it sound norwegian , because `` z '' really does n't work in norwegian , going `` we already have a word with the same origin '' and reusing `` tog '' , pronunciation and all . 
  in general , though , there probably would be exceptions when the word has been imported from german in modern times . 
   then apparently words like foster , ost , gjort , lort , sort all have a long / u / pronunciation , yet they end on two consonants . 
  ( and post and kost are short / o / again ) to start with this is complicated because one of your examples has three distinct meanings : `` kost '' can rhyme with `` post '' , in which case it 's a synonym of `` diet '' , with `` ost '' in which case it means `` broom '' , or it can be one of the past tense forms of '' \u00e5 kose '' ( `` to cuddle '' ) , where it sounds similar to the long `` o '' in ost , but slightly longer . 
  the latter case is a result of retaining the longer `` o '' of `` kose '' ( compare '' \u00e5 komme '' =  `` kommer '' =  `` kom '' , where the `` o '' in `` kom '' is also pronounced like in german `` kommen '' ; the diferent tenses will tend to retain the same sound even when the number of consonants changes ) secondly , the main rule is * two repeated * consonants . 
  like `` komme '' , `` hoppe '' , `` koppen '' etc. 
  i 'm unsure whether this rule coupled with our `` german rule '' covers all of the cases or if there are exceptions . 
  i 'd guess there probably are exceptions , most likely due to modern imported words , but i ca n't think of any of the top of my head . 
  `` kost '' in the meaning `` diet '' seems to have come from either middle low german again and/or old norse `` kostr '' , so our slightly expanded rule from above would seem to apply . 
  `` post '' obviously has a modern german parallel though it 's a relatively modern import . 
  `` kost '' in the meaning `` broom '' follows the `` standard '' modern rule of single vs repeated consonant . 
  a note on this is that i 'm * pretty sure * i was never told of the link with german in school in norwegian lessons . 
  i * may * have been told about it in german lessons or possibly if i was told about it in norwegian lessons it would be because my german teacher the last 2 ears of school was also my norwegian teachers , but i think part of the confusion over norwegian pronunciation here is that most people never learn german will likely never have told . 
  without knowing that link , it probably seems pretty random . 
  even having an idea about it , i still had to do some digging to figure out what was going on with zug/tog ... 
  but having even an idea about it explains a lot . 
  i think it 's a good illustration of why we should sometimes at least learn the basics of things people think they 'll never need . 
  a second foreign language ( after english ) used to be compulsory in norwegian schools ( usually german , french or latin ) . 
  when i went to school it had been reduced to being compulsory for 2 years * if * you opted to study towards the norwegian equivalent of uk a-levels or french baccalaur\u00e9at ) . 
  i do n't know what the rule is now . 
  english on the other hand was compulsory from year 4 ( now i think it 's compulsory from the first school year )  it makes me think though : what dialect do tv presentors speak ? 
  mostly their own . 
  often to the frustration of viewers everywhere ... on the other hand it has probably contributed to ensuring better understanding of dialects across the country . 
  it used to be the case that more of them would effectively speak bokm\u00e5l or more rarely nynorsk , similar to the use of received pronunciation , but today it 's extremely varied . 
  written danish and written bokm\u00e5l / norwegian are very close anyway , so i can see that working too . 
  to throw a spanner in this , i * do * pronounce the * g * in * og * , though you 're right you can omit it . 
  my pronounciation is in fact pretty close to the dutch * ook * as [ found here ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ook#dutch ) , though with a marginally softer end - the difference between k and g in norwegian can be quite subtle . 
  and if you look at the etymology you 'll see why they 're similar - they 're both believed to have the same proto-germanic root . 
  i 'm trying to think of other norwegian words with this pronunciation ( edit : for the `` og '' combination - there are plenty with '' \u00e5g '' that are pronounced that way ) , and the only i can think of is * dog * ( old form of `` but '' , similar to german/dutch * doch * which again explains the source of the sound ) , though unlike * og * , in * dog * the `` g '' is always pronounced . 
  ( edit : there 's of course also * tog * - train ; probably missing more ) ( edit : in fact , i believe you can often se this distinction clarly if you go looking for words where the modern spelling of the german word that shares the same proto-germanic root uses `` u '' vs `` o '' - * buch * =  * bok * , * doch * =  * dog * , * auch * =  * ogs\u00e5 * ; it does n't work for `` und '' , but that 's because * og * shares the root with * auch * , not with * und * , while * und * shared the root with the norwegian * enn * ( closer to the english * than ) ) `` g '' is often omitted or softened , at the end of words in when following / \u00e6\u026a\u032f / , e.g. 
  all of these words * can * be pronounced without a `` g '' : jeg , meg , deg , seig , deig in bokm\u00e5l ( `` book norwegian '' - norwegian is not a language in itself ; it is a family of dialects + two formalized related languages ) and dialects close to bokm\u00e5l can all be pronounced ending in / \u00e6\u026a\u032f / . 
  part of the answer for the inconsistencies is that norwegian is very intentionally and systematically reformed - there has been extensive political meddling ever since the union with denmark was dissolved in 1814 to try to unify the language-group more , which has involved extensive changes to spelling , and that has also to some extent driven pronunciation changes . 
  the official languages - bokm\u00e5l and nynorsk - are both artificial collections of aspects of different languages ( bokm\u00e5l starting with danish-as-used-in-norway and nynorsk starting with a compilation of norwegian rural dialects ) , and as such it is remarkable that they are as similar as they are . 
  yes , dutch reads to me ( as a norwegian ) as a mix of german and norwegian with a bunch of extra consonants thrown in to confuse matters . 
  edit : note that the different types of connections indicate large ranges of lexical distance , so it 's quite possible the diagram accurately reflects the distance . 
  quite possibly . 
  norwegian often speak norwegian very differently when talking to swedes as well . 
  especially people from south-east norway , which tends to have grown up watching swedish tv . 
  we tend to end up with some weird norwegian-swedish mix that varies greatly depending on which swedish words any particular person knows . 
  there 's even a name for it : [ svorsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svorsk ) . 
  i 'm norwegian , and i 've more than once had to tell other norwegians to repeat things or slow down ... 
  i once told a guy from somewhere near bergen i did n't understand danish very well ( because it sounded like a weird danish dialect to me ) and if he could please repeat it more slowly . 
  got a bit embarassing . 
   seriously though , that was a good response . 
  and not just for the civic lesson and attitude . 
  it 's also impressively simple , straight-forward language for a politician . 
  even for a follow-up on something he 's said to kids . 
  no big words . 
  basic enough that i could struggle through it on the basis of knowing norwegian ( icelandic and norwegian share old norse as a common root , though icelandic remains much closer to it than norwegian does ) and learn a few words in the process . 
  i 've read statements from politicians in languages i speak fluently that have been far harder to decode . 
  if this is representative of how he communicates , we should make it mandatory for our politicians to sit through communications training with him . 
  they 're presumably looking at total healthcare costs ( public + private spending ) . 
  norway ends up above or below the us from year to year depending on currency fluctuations . 
  [ no , sweden has lower income tax than the united states for average earners ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/taxation/taxing-wages-2016_tax_wages-2016-en#page23 ) ( individual states will end up above or below that , though ), 
  * marginal * tax , yes . 
  pretty much nobody pays that , due to the greater class divide you point out . 
  people need to be more mindful of the difference between marginal rates and what people actually pay . 
  a single person on average income in sweden , pays 24.7 % income tax and employee social security contributions vs. 25.6 % in the united states .

  i believe there are some housing in docklands being heated with excess power from data centres too . 
  at least one of the larger data centre operators were bragging about how they we 're going to be providing waste heat a while back . 
  i suspect that comment is wasted on most people who have n't lived in the uk ... 
  i do n't know about sweden , but in norway it 's extremely unusual to have a gas supply to your house . 
  when i moved to the uk it took me years to get comfortable with a gas hob ... 
  do you mean this specific version , or the story ? 
  because [ heidi is one of the best selling books ever written ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_best-selling_books ) with an estimated 50 million copies sold . 
  have n't seen this specific version though . 
  tintin consistently features on lists over the highest circulation comic-series of all time ( competing favorably alongside e.g. 
  marvel/dc series with runs in the hundreds of issues ) , coupled with the cartoons / cgi movie ... 
  so i do n't think anyone is forgetting about tintin . 
  i was a co-production that included a bunch of countries including spain , so it 's not surprising . 
  the main production company responsible was french and the script-writers etc. 
  as well , though , so it 's mostly french . 
  this is one of the most fanciful depictions of events i 've read . 
  noteworthy in that it is a level of whitewash that even [ cia 's own heavily sanitised declassified documents clearly contradict ] ( http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nsaebb/nsaebb435/ ) . 
  their involvement - and that of the uk - included destabilising mossadeghs regime , engineering demonstration , bribing and pressuring the shah into issuing the decree etc. 
  the emergency powers , though they were certainly legally questionable , were a result of mossadegh correctly identifying that that there were already plans underway to carry out a coup against him . 
  it was a stupid move in that it went too far in trying to create legitimacy for a move against the shah , and in doing so made justifying the coup easier , but by the time of the emergency powers his regime had already for a long time been a victim of interference . 
   iran became more of a democracy after his removal , that 's a fact . 
  that is at best a creative reinterpretation based on the emergency powers , which were only there because of the active destabilisation by the us and uk . 
  before the uk and us intervention , there was a multi-party democracy where the main threat was the shah . 
  afterwards , the parties that had majority support in the people were outlawed , and most political power was concentrated with the shah and the court . 
  it was a massively regressive step , where the emergency powers were a direct consequence of the coup plans . 
   and iran never had better civil liberties than in the period after mosaddegh 's legal removal .
