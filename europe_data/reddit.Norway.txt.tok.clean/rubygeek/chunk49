  you see the same in the west , as many have pointed out . 
  partly because of reconstruction after the war , partly because brutalism was seen as more `` honest '' and functional , and was actually * popular * for a while , while at the same time being relatively cheap to construct . 
  [ this is an example of what was seen as * desirable * brutalist architecture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbican_estate#/media/file:barbican_towers.jpg ) ( from the [ barbican estate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbican_estate ) in central london ) in the 60 's . 
  in my experience , in recent years if you make some sounds that vaguely sounds like a broken attempt at speaking french , they 'll switch to english and both be very pleased that you * tried * to speak french , and very pleased that after your disastrous attempt their english sounds perfect in comparison . 
  at least this was the case last time i went to paris . 
  it was actually bordering on annoying , as it made it hard to actually practice my broken french . 
  parts of russia may be geographically european , but culturally europe is nowhere remotely uniform , and russia is completely alien to a lot of europeans . 
  that said , i had to look up what you meant , and i do n't think i 've ever come across cultured butter though it apparently is possible to get in norway ( where i 'm from ) and i 'm sure it must be available in the uk too , but the norwegian brands i found that are apparently cultured butter are brands i 've never heard of . 
  i 'm not surprised if it 's more available in europe , but on extensive travelling in europe i do n't think i 've ever been served cultured butter - at least i only remember getting sweet butter at least as sweet as what i 'm used to from both norway , the uk and the us . 
  i suspect this is one of those things like how `` european style '' being used in the us hotel industry to mean not having toilets in the room that is a century or more out of date in most respects . 
  cheese has been produced for 5000 years , largely because it 's an easy , low-tech way of making use of milk that 'd otherwise spoil , so that makes no sense . 
  the culturing process of making cheese can start with raw milk without additional bacterial cultures . 
  it 's simple enough to do it at home ( with some caution - you 're growing bacteria cultures on purpose , after all ) . 
  even if they do n't want to produce locally , either refrigeration or pasteurisation ( heating the milk ) would both let it last just fine for much longer and wo n't ruing it for cheese production . 
  it may be true in practical terms that they actually manage to fuck this up , but if so it 's incompetence , not distance , that 's the actual culprit . 
  in fact a large part of the reason for the production of dairy products like cheese was exactly to make it last longer than unprocessed milk , so not only is it a poor excuse , it simply does n't stand any kind of test . 
   ( also , for some incomprehensible reason , cultured butter is nearly impossible to find . 
  it 's not like they ca n't make it -- all the same stuff goes into kefir etc. 
  anyway ! ), 
  probably just eating habits . 
  a lot of dairy product eating habits are very region specific and demographic specific . 
  i know about kefir but i 've never tried it and do n't know anyone who 'd ever buy it ( norwegian , living in the uk ) i 'd also guess a lot of the low-lactose cultured dairy products had an easier time becoming popular in populations with more lactose intolerance and/or with warmer regions where storing non-cultured dairy was harder before refrigeration , and/or simply due to geographic proximity to other regions where such products are popular . 
  in norway for example , lactose intolerance was just `` not a thing '' until more migration - lactose intolerance has been very low - and temperatures made cultured milk products `` unnecessary '' . 
  there 's still some use of it , but there 's much less of a tradition for it than elsewhere . 
  as a norwegian , this seems accurate given their description of norwegian . 
  there 's a saying in norway that danish is as if someone is speaking norwegian with a potato in their mouth . 
  in comparison , dutch to me is as if someone ca n't make up their mind whether to speak german and norwegian , while choking on the potato . 
  here 's a description of my experience of uk healthcare : gp/doctor visit : * we walk in , get our consultations , walk out . 
  forgot to fill out paperwork , you say ? 
  no such thing . 
  birt/postnatal care : * wife given the full works including every painkiller known to man . 
  quote , in drug haze : `` just so you know , i 'm a lawyer , i 'll sue you if you do n't get me that epidural '' . 
  as if they wanted to listen to more than necessary ... 
  sent home with son , regular post-natal nurses visits . 
  total cost : 0 a&e ( er ) : * son vomiting : taxi to a&e . speak to triage nurse . 
  show to special childrens waiting area after details taken . 
  consider mid priority - small child , but nothing expected to be serious . 
  seen after 45 minutes or so . 
  given thorough check . 
  signed out . 
  walk out without any bills . 
  * wife falls and thrust her arm through thick glass pane in kitch door . 
  slices arm for about 3-4 inches right next to the artery . 
  nicks it slightly . 
  blood everywhere . 
  ambulance there in < 5 minutes ( we 're lucky , the hospital is nearby ) . 
  taken to a&e ( er ) ; bleeding stopped in ambulance . 
  given painkillers but long a&e wait as considered low priority ( non-lifethreatening after bleeding was stopped ) but potentially complicated . 
  in the morning we 're sent to other hospital that has specialist surgeons as they have concern over long term mobility - the cut sliced at least one tendon in the wrist . 
  spend 4 days in hospital , get seen by specialist surgeon with extensive plastic surgery experience who both save full mobility in the hand and minimise scarring . 
  total bill : 0 . 
  * wife gets chest pain a while later . 
  calls ambulance . 
  they check her out , realise it 's just a severe panic attack , take time to sit down and calm her down , show her breathing techniques to help , tell her to not hesitate to call again if it reoccurs ( chest pain is taken very seriously whether the cause turns out to be serious or not ) and not to worry if it turns out to be panic attack again . 
  no bills . 
  * wife admitted to hospital after 3 hours wait in a&e over suspected glandular fever . 
  spends week in hospital while repeated tests are taken , and they manage her fever . 
  probably was glandular fever but tests not conclusive . 
  in the end they wanted to keep her longer but she felt well enough that she discharged herself after a week against medical advice . 
  again , no bill . 
  only waits beyond worst case 3-4 hours a&e waits for low pri problems : * i got a `` mystery illness '' that required several specialist visits , ultrasound and a variety of tests over several weeks . 
  no bill . 
  two weeks wait for first specialist . 
  * wife had to wait ~ 2 months for a routine surgery that was not time sensitive . 
  now , yes , there are waits for non-essential surgery , which is rather unsurprising given that we pay far less for healthcare . 
  upside is that public healthcare here is prioritised based on need , not on your ability to pay . 
  and if you * do * want to skip the queue , you can still pay for private insurance , which as it happens is generally far cheaper in the uk than in the us , because they have to compete with `` free '' ( yes , we know we pay over our taxes , though that too costs the vast majority of us far less than in the us ) . 
  in fact , going private in general is so much cheaper even when paying cash at top london clinics that if you live in the us it may pay to consider uk private hospitals if you ever need non-urgent private care ... 
  but public healthcare here is good enough that only 10 % take out private insurance , and most of that is because it 's a tax efficient perk to offer , not because people actively seek it out . 
  can you please occupy the uk , so we can get some decent pastry here ? 
  irrefutable logic, 
  why am i not surprised it turns out to be a swede who confuses a ship tunnel with a bridge . 
  it takes a dane to think that this is/was a huge amount of rock to move . 
  i 'm assuming they 've used a bit of dynamite , and dumped a bit of rubble , possibly poured some concrete to stabilise , and then filled with aggregates , compacted the ground , and recently added artificial grass . 
  this will not have been an expensive pitch at all , compared to the many inboor sports complexes and the like elsewhere . 
  wildlife is not likely to be very affected . 
  it 's [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/6700+m%c3%a5l%c3%b8y,+norway/@62.1287266,5.1591937,10.17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x46179dda970e7ccb:0x606cd01d8eff54f7!8m2!3d61.9355433!4d5.1135542?hl=en ) - both of the fjords in question are very exposed to weather and while they are `` separate '' they will not be particularly distinct . 
  the local wildlife is largely the same across large chunks of the norwegian coast west coast . 
  [ here is more information ] ( https://www.rakennusteollisuus.fi/globalassets/infra/infra-akatemia/louhintapaivat-2016/andreassen_stad_skiptunnel.pdf ) . 
  [ here is the official homepage for the project ] ( http://www.kystverket.no/en/about-kystverket/stad-ship-tunnel-project/ ) environmental effects would almost certainly be included in the impact assessment which is part of the project deliverables . 
  to be honest at the age i saw it , i was probably mostly concerned about the number of boobs i got to see than the story . 
  but it made a lasting impression . 
  i for one prefer to think a future under polish rule would be [ more like sexmission ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexmission ), 
  here the point is that specifying per capita makes the data easier to locate . 
  if you have to search for `` per capita '' and `` per 1000 '' and `` per million '' and everything in between , then finding an article that divides the statistic by a measure of the population becomes impossible . 
  that quote implies that it is used as a label whenever the measure is * normalised * by population so that they can be directly compared . 
  that they are not literally per capita is then irrelevant to the purpose of the label ( letting you find the article ) as long as it is specified in the article itself . 
  the `` soft drinks war '' probably mostly `` ended '' when pepsico started diversifying about 20 years ago . 
  the beverage division of pepsico makes up less than 50 % of revenues ( the rest is made up largely by fairy products and cereals ) , and carbonated drinks makes up less than half of the beverages ( tropicana and gatorade make up the majority of their beverage sales ) . 
  so while pepsi is still an important brand for pepsico , it 's not nearly as important as it used to be . 
  does n't mean there is n't still aggressive competition , but it 's not as much of a matter of survival for pepsico , which has changed focus quite a lot . 
  pizza hut , kfc and taco bell used to be owned by pepsi and all of them still have contracts with pepsi afaik . 
  they 're probably the three largest internationally . 
  most of the other larger chains that serve pepsi are predominantly in the us . 
  did you also think the guy throwing it was the hulk ? 
  true democracy is to seek compromises that are acceptable to as many as possible , not 51 % forcing its will on the rest with no checks . 
  this is why most countries have extra safeguards such as second chambers , executive vetoes , and constitutional guarantees . 
  the entire idea is that most of the time there is less damage done by temporarily preventing the change of law than there is by allowing big changes to be forced through with a narrow majority - if the use of the veto is wildly unpopular , people can always vote the person who used it out next time around . 
  the protection of the minority is * absolutely essential * as long as our best form of majority is still simple majority rule . 
  edit : to put it another way : a veto or qualified majority requirement slows progress , but at the same time make it far harder for society to * regress * again .
