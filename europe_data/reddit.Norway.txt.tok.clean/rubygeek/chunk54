  we need a jedi temple . 
  perfectly atheist - no gods involved . 
  hagia sophia the church is `` invisible '' in the picture because despite being the same building it 's no longer a church so you could say that there 's no visible church in the picture . 
  in reality it 's no less visible than the one that was posted the other day . 
  ah , i did in fact miss that , because it is in fact a very unusual structure . 
  [ here 's one outlining some of the ouright purchases ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-oxford-street-retail-2017-2?op=1&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t ) both in london and elsewhere . 
  it 's slowed down the decline of the smaller places at least , but not many are growing . 
  no , most of the transactions they do are for the buildings . 
  in some cases it makes sense to buy leases and do short lets , but few businesses are interested in short lets - they want leases . 
  [ e.g. 
  here 's an example , where they bought a majority stake in the company owning the freehold of some of the prime properties on regent street ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/11/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-london-landmarks ), 
  denmark was in union with norway at that point . 
  denmark-norway tried to stay neutral at first , but entered the league of armed neutrality - basically an attempt at countering british policy at the time of considering they had a right to search any merchant vessel . 
  this lead the uk to attack copenhagen several times as they saw it as hostile action . 
  as part of the attack in 1807 , the british confiscated the danish-norwegian fleet . 
  this forced denmark-norway into alliance with napoleon , which caused britain to extend its naval blockade against france to denmark-norway as well . 
  since sweden was on britains side , this left norway with limited access to food imports . 
  some food came in from danish boats managing to run the blockade and some came in via russia , but in autumn of 1809 , russia made peace with sweden , and food imports via russia came to a halt as well ( finland was not independent at the time ) . 
  that left norway highly dependent on local production that was not well enough developed to deal with year-by-year variations without the ability to import to cover shortages . 
  ( when napoleon lost in 1814 , norway was taken away from denmark and handed to sweden ), 
  i find the entire subject of national peculiarities like that very fascinating - often most locals do n't even know because it often becomes a sort established truth of local politics that is not discussed or questioned directly very often because it 's one of those things that have `` always '' been like that . 
  the british naval blockade gets more attention in norwegian primary schools than you 'd expect if you do n't know about the wider impact it had on politics and culture , but most people just never question why it gets that treatment . 
  it extends well past history lessons , as for example , one of the most famous epic poems in norwegian literature - [ terje vigen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terje_vigen ) - has the blockade as its setting , and is one of the few poems from the era , or * any * era , that most norwegian school children can at least name , and will usually have had to read ( it 's long ... ) . 
  but at least when i was young , no teacher drew the line from that to food security , though we were certainly taught about the importance of food security , which also gets a surprising amount of space if you do n't know about the background . 
  it often seems like a big failing of education that schools ar not better at connecting the dots on these kind of things as they do certainly explain a lot . 
  especially when you try to igure out why different countries have such different attitudes to these kind of things . 
  if one is norwegian living in london , like me , you quickly learn from hearing norwegian around you on a daily basis that we 've infiltrated everywhere . 
  mostly conducting raids on oxford street , though . 
  oh , and our pension fund keeps buying up half of london . 
  not quite as gory as longships , but a lot more profitable for all parties ... 
   a norwegian client told me this was due to the government wanting to spend in the better distribution of the population within the country , so the territory would be populated all over and not just in the south and main cities . 
  this is very much true - norway spends vast amounts of money keeping smaller settlements viable . 
  part of it boils down to national-romanticism - the image the modern nation of norway is built on involved a lot of idealisation of the countryside . 
  part of it is strategic . 
  the idea of ensuring food security has been important to norwegian politics ever since the british naval blockad of denmark-norway during the napoleonic wars let to extensive food shortages in norway over a period of several years . 
  strategically spreading the population out is also seen as part of the reason why the german invasion of norway took as long as it did despite how totally unprepared norway was - the main cities fell quickly , but norway is big and there 's people and settlements everywhere ; the remaining military forces could keep moving until some degree of allied reinforcements were able to intervene and delay things further . 
  these have combined over the last two centuries into a culture that has for the longest time actively tried to coutneract centralisation and that still to a large extent see urbanisation as a threat . 
  it was n't his doing - it was the intent from the start . 
  most of the countries involved were powderkegs due to extensive long ranging political upheaval . 
  if germany had won , it 'd probably have faced attempts at revolution itself . 
  again . 
  if the red army had lost , some other group would try again . 
  and again . 
  the societal tensions that triggered these events would not just go away . 
  it might end up better , or it might just be different countries ending up with the genocidal idiots in charge . 
  [ haakon vii of norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haakon_vii_of_norway ) was sort-of elected - he insisted on a referendum on monarchy when norway became independent before agreeing to take the position if norway chose to be a monarchy . 
  but the monarchy from then on became hereditary . 
  there are examples here and there . 
  but i agree with overall point - if you just want a figurehead anyway , there 's no reason to make it hereditary . 
  people who want the monarchy often want it to avoid politicised presidental positions but you can equally achieve that by just not giving the president any real power , and optionally electing them for longer periods . 
  personally i find the symbolism of retaining a hereditary position that used to be a dictatorial one rather offensive . 
   i would love to live in that ideal world where people that criticise socialism know what socialism is . 
  now , that is truly a utopian vision . 
   my point is that it is impossible for a state to transition into and remain a stateless communist system and the marxist view is that it is impossible for it not to once the historical development goes far enough . 
  ultimately neither hypothesis is provable other than by waiting and seeing what happens - we have no choice but to wait and see . 
   however you still believe the utopia is possible . 
  interestingly i see this a lot : it is usually right wing people trying to tear apart socialism that ascribe it all kinds of fantastic utopian properties , often ones that are directly at odds with the ideologies they talk about . 
  someone elsewhere tried to attack socialism over `` equal pay '' , but marx was against equal pay and argued at length that fairness requires unequal pay ( because people have different needs , and different abilities ) . 
  so which utopia is that ? 
  i do n't believe things will magically get better overnight , any more than it got magically better in the past during the transitions from feudalism to capitalism . 
  the actual changes for most people took a long time . 
  sometimes long periods of dramatic turbulence . 
  other times the process was just slow . 
  norway , which was fortunate enough to have a mostly peaceful transition , took about a century to throw off the last vestiges of feudalism and near-absolute monarchy to parliamentarian democracy . 
  there 's no reason to assume a transition to another system would yield an instant transformation when past transitions have often taken this long or longer . 
  this view also seem to think that socialists see capitalism as some great evil where everything needs to change , but that is also nonsense . 
  marx spent large parts of the communist manifesto praising capitalism into the skies for the rapid development it had brought even in his time . 
  marx saw capitalism as the then-pinnacle of human society : flawed , but nevertheless the best we 've achieved so far . 
  a platform to build on , not something to tear apart . 
   the only thing we disagree about is whether or not stalin is correct in his identification of the ussr as communist . 
  stalin never identified the ussr as communist as far as i know . 
  if you have any source for when he might have done so i would very much like to see it as i 'm sure it 'd take some interesting contortionism to justify . 
  in his speech to the 18th congress of the cpsu in 1939 , he amongst others said :  as you see , we now have an entirely new , ** socialist state ** , without precedent in history and differing considerably in form and functions from the ** socialist state ** of the first phase . 
    but development can not stop there . 
  we are going ahead , ** towards ** communism my emphasis . 
  so as of 1939 at least he did not claim the soviet union had achieved communism . 
  that speech is actually quite interesting for being full of stalin making excuses for why the soviet union still has a strong state , and explaining away why the soviet state is not `` whithering away '' despite his claim that the soviet had also removed the `` class antagonisms '' ( he specifically claims this , rather than claim it no longer had classes ; an important distinction because the latter would ruin his excuses for the continued existence of a strong state ) . 
  as such , with some critical reading it actually contains a pretty good overview of marxist ideas around the destruction of the state as stalin sets out the marxist position only to try to shoot it down or make up excuses for why the soviet union is somehow special . 
  i 've not found any good later sources in either direction . 
   liberalism in its core is right-wing orientation ( you should work hard and get big reward ) that 's not liberalism . 
  that 's closer to a right-libertarian viewpoint . 
  you 'll find some of it with moderate centre-right ( by modern standard ) liberals as well , but it certainly does not define liberalism . 
  some might see it as the expected * outcome * , but what defines liberalism is a focus on an equal right to freedom . 
   a liberal would say `` its their probl\u00e9m , i have my own , unlock my shackles and let me tak\u00e9 care of myself '' . 
  thats a right-wing way of thinking . 
  a right-libertarian would tend to say that . 
  some centre-right liberals too , but by far the most liberals in europe supports welfare systems , on the same basis as left-libertarians do : freedom is not possible without the means to exercise it , at the very minimum without continued life . 
  as such , to maximise freedom , you must at the very least protect life ( the centre-left liberal end of the scale ) or provide a degree of equality ( the left-libertarian end of the scale ) . 
  as a libertarian socialist , for example , if we have two people - one is starving and one has enough food for two - , i would argue that if the second one is not willing to share his food it is justified to take from him under the principle of maximising liberty because that loss of property is a far lesser restriction of liberty than the loss of the other persons life or threat to their health . 
  to me , right wing liberalism and libertarianism is often hypocritical for this reason . 
  lacking the means to exercise your liberty is as much of a cage as iron bars . 
  if you are committed to liberty , the left-libertarian view is that it becomes a question of whether a government intervention enhances or damages liberty , whether that means respecting or weakening property rights , where right-libertarianism tends to sacrifice liberty the moment increased liberty would come at the expense of property rights . 
  ( as an example of sacrificing property rights to increase liberty : i 'm norwegian ; in norway you can e.g. 
  walk through any private forest at will , camp there etc. , on the basis that historically limiting people from accessing nature has been seen as a too great sacrifice of liberty to be acceptable - this limits private property rights sharply ; you e.g. 
  ca n't legally put up fences and locked gates intended to keep people out of a private forest ; but it is seen as greater increase in liberty for the overall population than the decrease in the liberty of the land owners )  because stalin and hitler were both on the other side of axis y and x i agree with your overall 2d rather than a single axis , but stalin and hitler were fairly close also in terms of economy : they both actively centraised control over the means of production rather than decentralise it in the hands of the working class . 
  hitler let industrialists retain ownership and retain somewhat more control , but stalin too put control of industry in the hands of a wealthy elite . 
  hitler retained more of a market system , but a market system is yet another axis - many left wing ideologies favours market mechanism ( e.g. 
  you explicitly have `` market communism '' as one example ) . 
  this is like saying a cat is de facto a dog , even though it does n't meet the definition of one , just because someone else has put a sign on one that says `` dog '' . 
  it 's meaningless nonsense .
