  norway has the luxury problem that spending all our money would case a lot of problems . 
  this is a large part of the reason why the oil fund invests predominantly outside of norway ( the norwegian government has plenty of investments inside of norway too ) . 
  better to build up future cash flow to make sure we can * continue * to invest and spend . 
  the markets applied no corrective force because the markets ** correctly ** saw the risk that they 'd be forced to shoulder their own losses as low . 
  what the bailout have demonstrated to them is that it 's safe to lend to high risk euro countries at low interests , because chances are high they 'll get bailed out at the taxpayers expense if the state the lend to mess up . 
  it 's clear that greece needed to clean up their act , but the way this was treated have given banks one more reason to keep low risk scores in their models . 
  the markets are a competent corrective force when those who mess up their models fail . 
  but in this case 1 ) they were not allowed to fail , 2 ) because they were not allowed to fail , their models were correct . 
  in other words : the markets made the right call . 
  for ** the banks ** . 
  the markets will not make the right calls for taxpayers , because we 're not their investors - other than to the extent some banks have been nationalised , like e.g. 
  in the uk . 
  this is critical to keep in mind : lenders will take ridiculous risks if you socialise those risks so that the risks are not great ** to them ** , because their models are only concerned with whether or not * they * will lose or earn money , because that 's their job . 
  if you want responsible lenders , they need to face real risk . 
  you * ca n't * bail them out . 
  at most of you can bail out * customers * of these lenders by nationalising them . 
  but shareholders in irresponsible companies needs to lose their investments . 
  it 's important to realise that in addition to the issues of poverty etc. , nsdap did not win a majority in any election . 
  they got a lot of votes , sure , in part due to an amazingly well run organization coupled with threats , violence and propaganda . 
  on top of that , the opposition was split . 
  stalin had ordered komintern member parties to refer to social-democrats as social-fascists and try to brand them as being pretty much the same as the nazis . 
  this backfired horribly by causing massive infighting between the komintern parties and social-democratic parties across europe , and made it easier for parties like nsdap , both by keeping their opponents occupied and by making them seem more reasonable : people were told by the communist parties that the social democrats were the same as nazis , and most people did n't see the social democrats as all that bad . 
  it made a lot of criticism of the nazis seem untrustworthy . 
  but even despite the favourable conditions , it took a lot of deceit for hitler , coupled with exploiting the reichstag-fire and the following expulsion of the communist party representatives , to secure enough votes from the other right wing parties by promising to do all kinds of things , coupled with intimidation and threat of violence , to get power handed over . 
  it was the perfect storm of conditions that made it more favourable , coupled with coercion and a * lot * of deceit and social engineering . 
   the leaders of britain , russia and germany were not only related by blood , but also grew up together as children ... ... and wilhelm ii was colonel-in-chief of the royal dragoons . . as they remarked on qi : he failed to show up , as he was busy leading the enemy forces ... 
  no , they are lending at extremely low interest rates to prevent greece from defaulting on more debt : they realise that the only way of getting money back at all given the totally unsustainable debt levels of greece is to make default seems unthinkable coupled with being * just * tolerable enough with their terms to coax greece into taking the option of continuing to pay . 
   are n't these the same lenders you expect to keep greece on its toes ? 
  the pressure he is describing is the threat of being forced to take up loans at high interests : if greece keeps on behaving badly , and taking up loans it later has to default on , it 's interest rates will skyrocket because most people wo n't want to take the risk . 
  public consultation often happens before the bills are formally introduced , and often - as for the uk government for example - includes posting the full drafts on a public website . 
  in some cases it includes soliciting input from the general public too ( though the cynics amongst us might suspect most of * those * gets archived in the bin ) . 
  and `` relevant stakeholders '' = = the public , even though some politicians do n't like to take that into consideration . 
  funny then , that such drafts frequently get substantially amended or even withdrawn after the public consultations in many countries . 
  often they are published exactly because * there 's not * agreement , and one party wants to create public pressure in support . 
  a lot of bills are published before they go to committee . 
  there 's no reason not to , and often there are substantial reasons to do so , in order to gain support . 
  ( edit : [ here is the page on draft bills for the uk government , for example ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/business/bills-and-legislation/draft-bills/ ) - note that the page points out that these bills are introduced formally into parliament , usually to committee 's * after * the public consultation ) but of course , there 's that crucial thing : to gain support what you want to achieve actually have to survive public scrutiny . 
  ** that ** is the real reason for secrecy in many of these instances . 
  that would be a great idea , yes . 
   but this is as if it 's at the stage before it goes to committee so ? 
  no , it would n't , as drafts for the vast majority of those are available at early stages . 
   in addition , it 's rare to see a draft of a piece of legislation before it 's completed . 
  no , it 's not . 
  in fact , in most legislatives what will be published initially will be drafts introduced into committee , that are often substantially reworked multiple times before they even go to the floor of whatever legislative . 
  in many systems - such as e.g. 
  most bicameral legislatives - you will then often get competing versions entered into the public record in each chamber that needs to be resolved before the act can be finally approved . 
  further , in many countries it is common for draft versions to be explicitly sent out for public consultation - both available to the public in general as well as specifically soliciting input from e.g. 
  business or organisations with competence on the specific area . 
  often such consultations leads to substantial revisions . 
  ( edit : [ here is , for example , the uk governments page about draft bills ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/business/bills-and-legislation/draft-bills/ ) - these drafts are generally made available for a period of public consultation * before * being formally introduced to the committee stages in parliament ) the release of early drafts is the standard modus operandi for most legislatives outside of dictatorships , not least because this is often a large part of the process used by legislators to obtain input and support to shape their campaigns to ensure there is support both in the public and the legislative . 
  there 's only one reason necessary : the level of secrecy . 
  any agreement negotiated in this manner should be shot down as a matter of principle regardless of content . 
  with any names that are not clearly purely unemotional descriptions of content ( and especially if they 're strained acronyms ) it is usually pretty safe to start out with the assumption it is/does the opposite of what the name indicates until proven otherwise . 
  the easy way to joke around americans is sarcasm . 
  it tends to pass straight by the type of people who 'd otherwise get mortally offended . 
  it 's why the uk and the us has such as `` special relationship '' : their us counterparts takes all the flattery and apparent politeness seriously . 
   the `` bad cop 's '' goal is n't to reach a deal . 
  and from this moment on we disagree . 
   ... or it suggests that the ec/ecb does n't trust greece to actually use the money given to them in a constructive way if left to their own devices . 
  they have already proven that they can , by getting to a primary surplus despite the massively destructive policies forced on them . 
  what they have achieved by being hostile is not bending over and accepting agreements that are so bad they 're not even worth considering . 
  when the other side is totally blind to the economic realities , what were their alternatives ? 
  even the imf have criticised the ecb/ec for ignoring the realities and refusing to accept that their own proposals just simply ca n't work . 
  they needed to do something different , and they did , and now people are at least mentioning debt relief as a possibility again after the imf appears to have found their balls at last . 
  if the ec/ecb does not fix this and recognise that their policies failed disastrously , it will not just mean a greek exit from the eurozone , it will be the beginning of the end of the euro overall . 
   if what you are saying is true , and that the greeks burned through tens of billions in financial assistance to carry out a 4 month long troll read what i wrote again . 
  i certainly did not suggest they were `` carrying out a 4 month long troll '' . 
  there 's a big difference between being playing hard in negotiations and being a troll . 
  arguably , based on the imf report and based on nobel prize winning economists like stiglitz , they were not play hardball * enough * : the deals on the table are still disastrously toxic for both sides and indicates the ec/ecb simply does not understand the economics involved and/or refuses to acknowledge the facts ( e.g. 
  that the austerity have actually * worsened * conditions and substantially lengthened the crisis ) . 
  according to the imf it is not viable now . 
  whether or not it was viable last january is not the question . 
   it 's like he knew . 
  while i doubt that this was planned down to that detail , i also very much doubt that the greek actions over the last 6 months were varoufakis and tsipiras just randomly spouting incendiary stuff without a game-plan upfront that saw varoufakis as the `` bad cop '' and scapegoat to see how far they could push the ec before replacing him with a more moderate alternative to make the final deal . 
  you do n't go into negotiations like that with a background from game theory without thinking hard about what strategy to employ i suspect in retrospect it will be clear the ec has been played , and the question still remaining is just whether or not they 've been played * well * - that we 'll first know once we see if they succeed in securing a deal . 
   but why does he resign completely ? 
  because it was necessary to let the greek government essentially say `` see , we 've gotten rid of the bad seed , now * here * is some reasonable guy you can make a deal with '' . 
  i 've noted elsewhere that i think this was planned from the outset . 
  let varoufakis rattle some feathers and show them how difficult things * can * be , then bring in someone who will appear more moderate while asking for the same things . 
  even possibly * more * after the imf report . 
  yes , it was about time greece got some ministers with spines instead of the pond-scum that so readily accepted the extremely destructive policies of the troika . 
  the only thing that would have been `` constructive '' for the negotiations by ec/ecb standards would be bending over the negotiating table already lubed up . 
  if they had any serious intention of being reasonable in the first place , there would n't have needed to be any new bailout now as greece would have gotten liveable terms years ago . 
  because of course we should suddenly believe them after it 's been dangled in front of greece for years with nothing being put on the table . 
  note also how the imf have explicitly criticised the lack of willingness for debt relief from the ecb/ec side . 
   they have to stop financially unsustainable spending and they have done so . 
  depending on how damaging the current crisis ends up being and how quickly they get back or track , they are at or near a primary budget surplus this year . 
  the greek economy is only unsustainable currently because of the debt burden . 
  there 's plenty more then can and should do , but in terms of their current budget they 're more restrained than most developed countries . 
   at that point , the media that was reporting his statements of a sure awesome deal in 24h after no suddenly became `` toxic lying media '' in his words and he started claiming that he said that a deal could be reached ( if everybody simply gave them all they want ) . 
  not even the `` toxic lying media '' went anywhere near as far as your claims about what he said . 
   in addition , it has been made clear in advance that rejection of the agreement would mean rejection of the euro . 
  no , it was * claimed * by people who wanted to force a yes vote that this was the case . 
  no real basis has been given for that claim . 
  the imf has basically told the ecb and euro zone finance ministers `` fuck you , we were all wrong , and you guys were more wrong than most ; oh , by the way : fuck you for getting us to deviate from our rules '' with the report they released . 
  it was remarkable for how dramatically different it was from the negotiating position . 
  they 've * specifically * admitted they can not recommend a further bailout to their board without debt restructuring . 
  he most likely had a clue for months , and it most likely was a pre-planned role for him to be the big bad scapegoat . 
  if the negotiating partners backed down and yielded to greek demands , it 'd have been a huge win . 
  if they did n't , it 'd allow him to be replaced by a seemingly more reasonable person to change the negotiating dynamic .
