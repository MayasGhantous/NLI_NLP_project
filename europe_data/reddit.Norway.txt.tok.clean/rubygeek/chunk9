  by that argument , the eurozone leaders are * already * responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of greeks thanks to the previous rounds of austerity . 
  i think his departure was * planned * from the very beginning . 
  the guy is an expert game theorist , after all . 
  not agreeing with them has nothing to do with what i said . 
  many of them have impressive degrees , but the ** fact ** remains that most politicians are * not * subject matter experts in any of the areas they end up deciding on . 
  we often end up with experts in * cabinets * because they 're not directly elected ( e.g. 
  both varoufakis and sch\u00e4uble are actually economists ) , but even in cabinet positions we often end up with people who are not experts in any relevant subjects other than getting elected . 
  how often do you think angela merkel gets to use her ( admittedly very impressive ) degree in quantum chemistry ? 
  since when have we ever elected experts ? 
  it ca n't `` just undo '' laws of its member states , but if the law violates eu law , whichever law implements the eu treaty conditions into national law in spain would likely make any ecj decision binding on local courts . 
  the other alternative is the european court of human right , whose decisions also are generally binding through treaties . 
  there are two avenues to fight this : the european court of justice . 
  this would require the law to conflict with eu law . 
  secondly , the european court of human rights ( the echr is ** not ** a eu organ , but an organ of the council of europe , which includes many non-eu countries ) . 
  this would require the law to violate the european convention on human rights . 
  absolutely , but the way to fix that is to put in place regulations to give people more control over their workings hours across the board , rather than what amounted to a favour to a small proportion of the members of a specific union that benefited nobody else and actively hurt a large portion of other workers . 
   we 've had closed shops on sundays forever , well , sort of . 
  we 've had closed non-grocery stores for a long time . 
  but until 1998 larger grocery stores etc. 
  were more and more often open on sundays . 
  from 1998 onwards , that was tightened up substantially - only shops with an area of < 100 square meters could stay open on sundays . 
  when that change went into effect , the small local shops around where i used to live in oslo put out shopping baskets and started selling more groceries and they were all so full it was hard to move on sundays . 
   because in norway the government is trying to change it and that is really unpopular here . 
  misinformation from unions coupled with christian conservatives is largely the cause of that . 
  the change in '98 happened in the first place because handel og kontor ( union ) wanted it for their members and leaned heavily on arbeiderpartiet ( labour party ) , but their members only organised about 20 % of shop staff - most of the people affected by the change were students and other under-employed groups seeking part-time employment who afterwards found it much harder to get a job . 
  nobody gave a shit about the large number of affected part-time workers . 
  if they had , it would have been easy enough to put in place rules that protected both sides . 
  then again , sylvia brustad ( the minister in charge ) appears to have tried very hard to defined her career mainly by lying to and fucking over students ( i sat next to her at a debate once and listen to her make promise after promise that she then promptly broke when she was elected a month later - she 's one of the most disgusting politicians i 've had the misfortune of meeting , despite `` on paper '' being a lot closer to me ideologically than many others ), 
  this distinction is extremely common in england . 
  that 's a bullshit argument - most shops depends greatly on part time workers from categories of people where there are plenty of * underemployed * in pretty much every european country . 
  when a similar ban happened in norway , it was driven by a union organising mainly full time shop staff - employing about 20 % of shop staff , while the remaining 80 % were largely youth , including students , taking shifts outside of normal working hours - a lot of the appeal of these types of jobs are exactly that it is possible to work outside of hours when you e.g. 
  have school . 
  if you want to protect full time shop staff , then there are many ways you can do that which does not require you to shut on sundays : legislate extra pay ; legislate maximum working hours ; give strong protections for staff to designate off days and give full time employees preferential access to demand sunday and/or saturday off . 
  why exactly do you think they 'd need this as an excuse for raising prices if they think the market can bear it ? 
  hey , you guys had us last . 
  they gradually allied against him in a bid for survival - both to stop napoleon and to avoid being on the losing side as it became clearer napoleon was heading for defeat . 
  the ideological differences were secondary to that . 
  note that not * all * allied against him even at the end . 
  denmark-norway supported napoleon , for example ( and denmark lost norway to sweden as a result ) . 
  we all know [ belgium is n't real anyway ] ( http://zapatopi.net/belgium/ ) , you wo n't fool us . 
  a threshold after the fact would be incredibly scummy , but setting a threshold before the fact would not be at all unprecedented . 
   so why do n't the refugees go into safe areas in africa ? 
  surely it 's more affordable than a smuggler 's boat and those people only want to escape death , right ? 
  they do , but africa is a big continent and what is viable to get to for some is impossible to get to for others . 
  kenya houses more than half a million refugees . 
  chad more than 350,000 . 
  ethiopia almost 300,000 . 
  democratic republic of congo about 150,000 , republic of the congo about 140,000 , uganda near 140,000 , sudan 139,000 , tanzania about 131,000 , liberia 128,000 . 
  south sudan 105,000 . 
  and so on . 
  these are all in the top 30 recipients of refugees worldwide , despite being some of the poorest , most deprived - and in some cases war torn - countries in the world . 
  for comparison germany has about 570k , uk about 193k , france about 210k . 
   africa 's real problems are poverty , hunger , disease , lack of education and infrastructure and ethnic tensions . 
  not some imaginary torture and persecution . 
  you seem to want to treat africa as a single entity . 
  in ** parts ** of africa poverty is the biggest problem . 
  in others , it is brutally oppressive dictators or rebel movements . 
  it 's * irrational * to make a purchase based on sunk cost . . 
  the rational choice is to look at remaining/future costs as by definition , you 've spent the sunk cost already no matter which future choice you make . 
  i did n't mean to imply it is currently a federation nor that the eu is at an equivalent state to the * current * us or german systems , but neither the us or germany were federations early in the process of their formation either . 
  most federations that have formed from independent states have done so as a multi-stage process that starts out as something resembling a confederation or supranational union , though with many individual peculiarities . 
  the us started as a confederation ( 1776 until 1789 when the constitution turned it into a federation ) - an even looser association than the current eu , though there are many arguments for also classifying the eu as a confederation . 
  germany also had a substantial period as a confederation ( 1806-1815 under napoleon ; the 1815-1848 ; 1850-1866 ; north german confederation from 1867-1870 ) punctuated by the german empire ( which was also notionally a federation , though in reality not so much ) before it became a federal republic in 1918 . 
  the very point of making the eu a supranational union is that it is/was easier to achieve than a federation , since mentioning the `` f-word '' is still unthinkable for some even today , and solved * some * of the many issues of a looser confederation , though at the cost of a really hairy political structure . 
  many academics do also class the eu as a * de facto * federation even though it clearly is not a * de jure * federation , exactly because of the level of `` hacks '' applied to achieve many of the goals of a federation . 
  as an example , despite de jure being sovereign nations , member states are obliged to implement directives into local laws , thus allowing the eu de facto authority to decide the overall thrust of local laws . 
  this is far closer to a federal model than a confederate model . 
  and a federation * is * the end game for many pro-eu groups , as well as for many groups that are vehemently against the current for of the eu . 
   but then again the eu is the first and only of its kind sort of . 
  kinda . 
  depends entirely what criteria you 're considering . 
  several european countries ( germany being the most obvious example ) have gone through this kind of transformation from independent states towards a federation on a smaller scale . 
  the us went through a similar process - through the period of the articles of confederation , until they were found inadequate , and then the push for a federal system . 
  india is a federation , with even more language and culture clashes than the eu , and far more people , though unlike germany and the us it never went through the process of gradual accumulation of members so it is fairly distinct in that respect . 
  as i pointed out elsewhere , a lot of the complexity of the eu system is an acknowledgment of that in the form of trying to work around deficiencies of previous similar systems - first and foremost the problems the us faced prior to becoming a federation . 
  if you get specific enough , then of course eu is the `` first and only of its kind '' , but in most ways it 's not that unique . 
  the most unique aspect of the eu in this respect is perhaps that it is the first major push toward forming a large federation from scratch after universal suffrage ( and in that respect i mean both granting the vote to women * and * taking away criteria of land ownership * and * lowering the voting age ) . 
  the us and germany and other similar examples predates this , and while india postdates it , it came `` pre-packaged '' . 
  that certainly faces a long list of unique challenges . 
  it 's not that i 'm majorly concerned . 
  i 'm sure it 'd * eventually * get sorted out , and i would n't expect to suddenly get told to kindly bugger off `` home '' . 
  as i said , it 'd be as a precaution , mostly because it 'd represent an increased risk of various annoyances . 
  i just do n't want to e.g. 
  suddenly be in a situation where i 'd have trouble with things like remortgaging my house because the banks were uncertain about my long term residency ( as it is , when i got my mortgage , at least one of the major high street banks - forget which , i think it might have been halifax , - refused to even consider an application because norway is `` just '' an eea member and i did n't have an indefinite leave to remain ) , or end up with fewer legal protections for no good reason . 
  welcome to the world of coalition governments . 
  you think you 've seen political horse trading ? 
  current norwegian government is a two-party minority government with a supply agreement with two more parties in order to avoid no-confidence votes and get a reasonable amount of stuff through , and that supply agreement keeps resulting in high profile political friction in case after case , with accusations flying and threats of no-confidence votes , and internal turmoil in the involved parties on a regular basis . 
  at least it makes politics a far more interesting spectator sport . 
  i think that depends on how it 's sold . 
  a * huge * amount of the wtf factor of the current structure of the eu is down to `` workarounds '' for the fact that the eu is effectively a confederation of sovereign nations that is trying to operate as a federation in many areas . 
  the current structure is inferior to a `` proper '' federation in almost every way , but the current structure has one huge advantage : it 's far easier to sell a bunch of small step by step changes than selling the fairly invasive constitutional changes going for a full federation would mean . 
  but today a lot of power that one might expect would be held by the eu parliament is held by the commission or council not because people thought that was a great way of doing it , but because a more `` traditional '' power distribution will not work as long as member states are sovereign and so in effect - without the workarounds - are higher authorities than the eu parliament . 
  the us had similar teething problems under the articles of confederation , and it almost broke the union over the lack of an ability to enforce decisions , because individual state legislatures could ( and did ) just ignore decisions they disagreed with . 
  the eu approach is to try to work around these problems via treaties to bind the member states indirectly ( e.g. 
  the system of directives rather than being able to directly pass laws ) , but they remain ugly workarounds , and frankly i think the eu would seem a lot less scary and bureaucratic to a lot of people if they `` sold '' a restructuring into a federation the right way by `` packaging '' it with reforms to simplify the bureaucracy etc. . 
  it 'd by no means be an easy sell , but the irony is that the more the current eu system is vilified , while it may also lead to more opposition against the eu , the better it makes the case for substantial structural reform which may make it easier to get support for a federation . 
  quite a few european parties that are against or highly sceptical to the eu are , or have been , proponents of a european federal state , but are or were sceptical to the eu primarily because of the current power structures . 
  the more power proposed devolved from the council and commission to the eu parliament , the fewer eu-sceptic parties will remain eu-sceptics . 
  an example would be germany 's `` die linke '' which is highly critical of the current eu system , but whose predecessor pds already in the early 90 's had support for a federal europe in its party program . 
  i think getting that distinction through to the british electorate would be tough , but possible .
