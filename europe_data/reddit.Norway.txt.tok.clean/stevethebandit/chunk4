  alright , so that seems pretty unpopular . 
  kind of agree with you though, 
  right ? 
  french should be the global lingua franca and monarchies should n't exist in europe today , but that 's life with the eternal anglo, 
  iran should have been our ally in west asia from the start . 
  too bad the brits and americans fucked it up in their endless quest for money and oil, 
  their worst fear is to become irrelevant on a global scale i guess, 
  refugee = / = migrant, 
  of course it does n't merge our governments , but it opens europe up to american extreme corporatism, 
  against . 
  i really do n't want europe to become more reliant on america , we need to stand on our own , without their twisted system, 
  ukraine because of the color scheme bosnia because design georgia also because design, 
  yeah , there is a lot of music like that . 
  [ here 's another example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig5okq-raz4 ) if you actually like it, 
  really ? 
  it kind of is a joke song, 
  oh god that norwegian song . 
  kinda fun to listen to if you 're drunk but it 's torture when sober, 
  i 'm kinda biased because i love italy , but one stereotype is that you use your hands when you talk , something i 've seen italians do even when talking on the phone, 
  too bad the evil brits and swedes separated us just about 2 centuries ago, 
  rogue intelligence operations only happen in the movies, 
  ** 2015 people **, 
  it 's understandable . 
  thanks, 
  do you have a translated version ? 
  to be fair , trump said he 'd look at the countries contributions to defense , estonia is one of the few nato countries that exceed the 2 % defense spending threshold , so you seem to be approved, 
  pomak ? 
  been there , at the greek theater in taormina . 
  the view from the nearby small town of castelmola was incredible, 
  god damn that thumbnail , invokes mild ptsd whenever i see it, 
  beautiful - absolutely have to go there , sure do miss italy more than anything, 
  must be a scandinavian thing , they are delicious, 
  still stings after trentino-alto adige ? 
  it means that we are willing to compromise , when nato was founded , we were the only european nato member that bordered the soviet union , and allowing us troops to be stationed right next to their main port city and naval base would have been nothing short of hostile . 
  that would not have been a show of good faith towards a country that had liberated part of our territory from the germans just a few years earlier,

  and when we became a member , one of the prerequisites were that there were not to be any foreign bases on norwegian soil, 
  please no . 
  we do n't have tensions with russia here the same way continentals and americans do . 
  this would only make things worse, 
  was only briefly in milano on my way home from italy last time , really have to go back and explore both the city and the region, 
  you have my condolences, 
  someone 's looking to not get reelected, 
  3-4 strong cups of presidentti before going to bed is a must obviously, 
  she does n't want to get 1945 'd again i guess, 
  nigel has been googling a lot it seems, 
  absolutely agree, 
  quite the contrast to our king, 
  a prime example of good faith in european-mexican relations, 
  mexico has plenty of oil though, 
   silesia , southern east prussia and silesia i suppose you mean pommern ? 
  [ greater macedonia when ? 
  eu politicians really should n't compare european and american gun policy , in switzerland the reservists have guns in case of a foreign invasion , here in norway we have guns for sporting and hunting , while in america where they have guns to kill their neighbors in case they step on their property . 
  we do n't have a gun problem in europe , and there is no need for a `` gun control '' debate after a terrorist attack . 
  sad to see people moving away from the rural districts,

  finland is our best neighbor , so i hope we can do this, 
  i would n't count on it , family pressure is a very real thing, 
  seems quite the opposite to me with the talk among the brits about how the `` uneducated working class destroyed their future '', 
  will [ he ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15jocwpyyk8 ) return ? 
  of course not , there was a swedish plot to keep the other nordics out of eurovision this year, 
  so , the fact that estonia did n't qualify for the finale this year alongside norway , denmark , finland and iceland confirms their nordic-ness ? 
  looks kind of like home actually , just warmer, 
  you definitively are nordic , there 's no question about that but when it comes to scandinavia , the three of us are very close-knit and have significant relations . 
  you ca n't really say the same about denmark and finland , or sweden and iceland i think there are three ways to divide the nordics , norway , finland and sweden form a kind of arctic community and are bound by the sami , scandinavia is the second , which i already explained , and the third is denmark , norway and iceland , which are the remnants of the old danish empire , and have a community of our own, 
  language . 
  norwegian , danish and swedish sound similar enough to be understood ( for the most part ) by each other . 
  icelandic and finnish are not as similar, 
  but they wo n't be annoyed either, 
  obolon, 
  those birthrates wo n't save themselves, 
  this is basically any utopian ideology . 
  nazism , communism , anarchism , do not work in the real world, 
  annoyed me how people would n't stop changing the syrian heart into an fsa one, 
  schengen when ? 
  welcome to the club ... sure hope we 'll have your back against the germans , just like you 've had ours, 
  nothing quite guarantees quality like a made in italy label though, 
  that 's right , the usa never cared about terrorists , only oil good thing they spent everything they had in the propaganda department with saddam and the alleged wmds , or syria would have been next after their failed smear campaign of assad and the chemical weapons, 
   his country 's hdi is n't even above 0.940 literal third world tier, 
  all those poor cetmes ... 
   so this is a map i made because why not . 
  because of bragging rights obviously , you 're not kidding anyone, 
  i feel like this is very similar to the european ce marking and china export, 
  ah , remember that one as well sure drank a lot of beer when i was in italy now that i think about it ... 
  oh well , card or no card , beer was purchased , then consumed all the same also miss that 7 % beer with a guy with a hat on the label , ca n't remember the name of that one though, 
  yeah , got it at the local coop.fi which was a scam by the way , my coop card did n't work in italy , what 's up with that, 
  one thing that surprised me in italy was how good the beer was , `` mastri birrai umbri '' was my favorite i am not a beer snob though , so i may just have plebeian taste, 
  patrician choice my friend . 
  [ let me follow you up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nderafiode ), 
  i do n't think that 's as important as centralization , no, 
  i think it 's fairly universally agreed upon by norwegians that danish is easier to read , but swedish is easier to understand when spoken, 
  no , i see a lot of people that want to force a centralized eu to ensure we are not divided by the usa , china and russia , but i believe that would have the opposite effect though i agree that europe should stand together , it needs to be on our own terms, 
  ca n't claim to be a fan of increased centralization, 
  [ well , yeah , they kind of are ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/saudi-arabia-gulf-states-fund-islamic-extremism-germany-salafism-wahhabism-qatar-kuwait-islamists-a7473551.html ) they 're also interfering in both syria and yemen , though that is n't in the west, 
  do you really think russia is as bad as the ksa though ? 
  i guess he just had a brain drip and forgot the exact date, 
  nothing quite as triggering as when people assume that you 're talking about a place in the usa named after somewhere else,
