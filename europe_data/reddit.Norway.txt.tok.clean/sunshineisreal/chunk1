also lazy , self entitled . 
  in the context of not closing doors it 's `` do you have a dog ? 
  i think they are good too . 
  and they are a traditional newspaper so maybe a more fitting suggestion . 
  i 'd say [ nrk.no ] ( http://www.nrk.no ) , our state media . 
  yes , but it 's not the most usual one since it 's a long flight and not especially cheap . 
  went to nevada and california last year and did a two week road trip . 
  had a great time . 
  most people i 've talked to about it either had a nice time on their own trip or would like to visit someday . 
  listen . 
  the word obviously exists in swedish . 
  and i am fairly certain i know better swedish than a swiss . 
  it means `` things made of steel '' or `` steel '' . 
  let me try one more time . 
  the ( non ) plural of `` steel '' in english is `` steel '' . 
  they also have another meaning of the word `` steel '' which is `` to steel '' ( to edge , cover or point with steel ) . 
  the second meaning pluralises as `` steels '' . 
  okay . 
  so we have the same in swedish . 
  ( non ) plural of `` st\u00e5l '' is `` st\u00e5l '' . 
  the plural of the slang word used for money - `` st\u00e5l '' pluralises as `` st\u00e5lar '' . 
  they are not the same word . 
  you do n't understand . 
  so what is one steel in swedish and danish ? 
  the word steel is in itself both plural and not because it 's an abstract entity . 
  when you use it as slang for a non abstract totally countable entity you would pluralise as `` st\u00e5lar '' . 
  `` steels '' is a made up word . 
  it 's non-countable in english aswell . 
  as you said you need to add `` types of '' . 
  you can not say one , two or many steel . 
  how do you determine what one steel is ? 
  if you make it in to something countable like a pipe , you can say one , two or many steel pipe ( s ) . 
  well , yes , but you do n't pluralise `` st\u00e5l '' because it 's non-countable . 
  but then you make it slang for money which is countable and you get st\u00e5lar . 
  i will admit i could be wrong but this is how it works in norwegian atleast where we have the same term . 
  i guess the correct translation would then be `` steels '' . 
  surprises me you have n't ever heard of ex . 
  laken or daler . 
  some are out of fashion though . 
  laken ( 1k ) - sheet l\u00f8k ( 1k ) - onion lapper ( 1k ) - notes h\u00f8vding ( 1k ) - chief st\u00e5ler - steel grunker - not sure daler - old currency kronasjer - fake ( ? ), 
  conjugation of krone spenn - not sure gryn - groats klink - sound coins make skilling - old currency, 
   st\u00e5lar translates perfectly to `` steel '' . 
  we had the mp7 in the city . 
  tried the hk416 during basic though . 
  faroese is like a super strange norwegian dialect , i imagine i could get around in torshavn with some weeks of getting used to it ( looking away from the fact we could probably speak straight danish/norwegian ) . 
  on the other hand i almost ca n't decipher a single word of icelandic . 
  of course i know you are not `` american liberal '' . 
  you are nordic socialists . 
  i love you guys . 
  i think you combined nordic socialism with sencible liberaism perfectly . 
  from a nordic standpoint . 
  nothing is ever perfect but i think you 're doing great . 
  that said , i love both our countries . 
  i do n't know about this show , but as a norwegian i love christianshavn . 
  well i love copenhagen as a whole . 
  you guys are our liberal brothers . 
  totally off-topic i know . 
  this was even in norway . 
  norway too . 
  although we probably got it from german . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  probably to preserve the net and/or make more money of those that need high upload speeds . 
  for me it 's all i need . 
  i 'm using the provider our complex has a deal with , have n't checked any other providers . 
  160mbps down , 25mbps up no cap cable ( with tv ) city 27 euro/month, 
  i 'm no expert but i would say some of both , and that it happened gradually . 
  i 'm not sure we have imported more than other countries but the key factor is that we never dub , only sub . 
  we also start mandatory english lessons from grade one . 
  it 's never a choice these days and english is everywhere , you will miss out on alot if you do n't speak english . 
  it 's taken for granted that everyone knows english . 
  native companies might make english ads with no subs ( for theatrical reasons ) etc. 
  also , in my current job fluent english is crucial , yet i was never once asked during interviews how my english was . 
  on vacation in the us it hit me how at home i felt since everything was in english . 
  considering all this , people have different abilities and a second language is n't always easy for everyone . 
  we produce enough that we would n't need foreign media , especially if you count the other scandinavian countries . 
  but we import everything with english speech since almost everyone is fluent anyway . 
  the amount of quality content is of course higher with english spoken media though . 
  alot of local media is in english also so i do n't know which category you would fit that in . 
  mind that this does not regard news media which is only in norwegian and from norwegian agencies . 
  they will sometimes use foreign media as sources of course . 
  and some people probably read or watch foreign news media online . 
  same in my dialect . 
  i say `` han peter og ho marie '' . 
  they do n't in standard norwegian . 
  if you act norwegian you will be considered so regardless of skin color . 
  if you do n't act norwegian ( or remotely western european ) you will be considered so . 
  same as norway . 
  * high five * . 
  yes . 
  we are a tribe , we are not any stronger than our whole . 
  you are expected to be successful and do your best . 
  we will help you , as you will help the next . 
  being flaunting or selfish is looked down upon . 
  makes for a successful society . 
  i understand northern swedish the best . 
  it 's so calm and clean . 
  exactly . 
  some people continue to act like self-righteous assholes and count themselves as victims . 
  give kindness and tolerance and you will get it back . 
  i tried to jaywalk in denmark .
