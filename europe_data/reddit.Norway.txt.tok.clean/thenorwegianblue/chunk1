they bought a new one : /, 
  give troll . 
  how much . 
  found [ the ugly bastard ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/@62.103004,7.204723,3a,15y,234.88h,84.2t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1saj5zl9dvl5nk0jflgli3mw!2e0?hl=no ) on google maps as well . 
  best thing was that he was there on his yatch , so he had his goons wrap it up in tarp and transport it out on a tiny rubber dingy . 
  it was one of the most russian things i 've seen . 
  saw a russian tourist buy a polar bear pelt for 60 000 nok ( $ 7000 ) and a three meter plastic troll once . 
  rich russians are * rich * . 
  the troll was n't even for sale . 
  different , but equally good !, 
  nobody wants samnorsk anymore :(, 
  pretty \u00e6ccurate . 
  lax , about a year ago , he was on the news in norway : http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/11/01/nyheter/skytedrama/utenriks/usa/flyplass/30108595/ yeah , the food is calorie rich , which it can be in norway as well , but the portions were absolutely insane , i could n't finish a single meal in a restaurant , let alone have starters or desserts :o . 
  and i 'm from a farming family , so i am kind of used to people eating a lot . 
  people also drink a lot more soda than we are used to ( in much larger cups ) , and that certainly does n't help . 
  been to california once as well , it was less of a difference , but there were still a lot more overweight people than i am used to . 
  been to texas once . 
  first person i met coming out of the gate was a woman so obese she needed a scooter . 
  no guns though ( someone i know did actually witness someone getting shot and killed in an american airpoirt ) . 
  stereotype confirmed . 
  we have , but mostly because of oil as usual . 
  i might be wrong but i think `` ken '' is from norse and has a modern equivalent in norwegian ( `` kjenne '' - feel , know ) `` lad '' is also of norse origin . 
  yeah i was just being pedantic for the sake of calculating it  i can actually follow one line almost back to the viking age , pretty cool . 
  there is however a pretty good chance of having some foreign blood anyways ( in my case my dad and his whole family has completely black hair and pretty dark skin , so there probably something there ) . 
  300 years would be about 12 generations ( 25 years per generation ) . 
  that would mean 4096 ancestors ( without inbreeding ) to research . 
  a lot of electronics are actually pretty cheap in norway , in many cases cheaper than in for example sweden , gb , denmark or germany . 
  the thing is that muslims will name their sons muhammed generation after generation while the common names given to babies otherwise vary from year to year , so there will be a lot of people named muhammed in total , but not every year . 
  its not even in the top 10 in 2013 in norway : http://www.ssb.no/navn/, 
  yep . 
  was at one in 2006 , got tear gassed by our french allies . 
  also accidentally started a flare fight with some british troops . 
  some people do for short periods . 
  banks do n't really care , because they end up making more money on interest . 
  some friends of mine did this when they were student . 
  its not a clever idea if you are thinking about the financial situation of your kids , but if you dont care about that then its not really a problem to do it . 
  just a bit stupid because in a stable market the downpayments are just really savings since you can get them back by selling the appartment ( and move on to a house or nicer appartment ) . 
  norwegian fishing is probably more sustainable than eu fishing . 
  russian fishing though . 
  sweden , literally a third world country . 
  yes . 
  a bit actually . 
  football and sports in general can be a great integrator and a world cup team can unite a nation . 
  in norway ( coastal at least ) any day of the year can be +10 c and rainy , does n't matter if its january or july . 
  sweden is more cold winter/hot summer . 
  yesterday we had 22 c and sun , today its 12 c and raining . 
  read [ russia : a 1000-year chronicle on the wild east ] ( http://www.amazon.com/russia-1000-year-chronicle-wild-east/dp/1590207238 ) a while back . 
  nice pop-history intro to russia . 
  and the etymology for - ting is `` common assembly '' , so they should all be red . 
  obligatory [ l\u00e6ffy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp1yclqxd1q ) that was what army service was like more or less . 
  from a village : its a nice community where people do a lot of stuff together . 
  downside is that there is n't much to choose from in terms of activities , culture etc live in a larger town now , but i go back ( 2hr drive ) about once a month + holidays if i 'm not going abroad . 
  potatoes and bread are vegetables , right ? 
  we do have some traditional fish and meat goods that are more or less saturated in salt as a preservative . 
  like our christmas dish [ pinnekj\u00f8t ] ( http://mp.imgi.no/4cffa0fe5aecc6db48dd0100-tinymce/460 ) and [ spekesild ] ( http://farminsittkjokken.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/slik-lager-du-spekesild-salting_600.jpg ) . 
  so probably about the same , 
   countries with the lowest mortality for both , chd and stroke , are france , switzerland and norway , with spain and italy coming close . 
  seems to not correlate with ops map . 
  i dont know what to think anymore . 
  its still my impression that northern food is a lot more salty and fat . 
  even up here where we eat quite a bit of fish . 
  at least in scandinavia we use some stupendous amounts of dairy products . 
  [ oddly this map does n't show numbers as high as ops in any county in norway ] ( http://imgur.com/cbbajyt ), 
  south west to north east : olive oil vs butter , wine vs beer vs vodka . 
  i would have voted darkthrone . 
  seems to be the general consensus in the russian literature i 've read . 
  and i think southern europe is getting lowered . 
  wonder if they 've taken that into consideration . 
  ca n't see imgur pictures at work ( :'( ) so i ca n't see the map . 
  norway will actually tip upwards as the north pole melts ( in fact it has been tipping since the last ice age ) , and this kind of cancels out the sea rising . 
  same with most of sweden afaik . 
  http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2012/april/319447 besides as any western norwegian knows , oslo is actually in sweden and/or denmark . 
  real norway shall rise again . 
  '' ... and bring them to heaven where there will be puppies and ice cream '' '' ... or that other place '' ~ god, 
  statsmeiningsobsk\u00f8nitetsterrorisme yeah , we do it in norwegian as well . 
  though it should be  obsk\u00f8n meiningsterrorisme p\u00e5 statsniv\u00e5, 
  denmark and sweden are pretty flat , while norway is basically a pile of rocks . 
  i live in the city centre of a small town and my house is higher than all of denmark , my local grocery store is at sea level . 
  in principle i agree . 
  in practice i 'd say `` if it ai n't broken , do n't fix it '' . 
  if we get a terrible king or queen at some point we can have a vote or something . 
  as it stands i do n't think the people would vote for a republic anyway . 
  also our royal family is perceived to do a good pretty neutral job , no guarantee for that if you elect a ( more or less powerless ) president . 
  it would likely be a well known political figure who would probably have less than 82 % support no matter who we choose . 
  nebbdyret perry . 
  i am a grown ass man , and i 've watched quite a few episodes of that . 
  its a totally legit way of writing stuff , but it is poor language use . 
  those words would all be written as sentences . 
  i wrote my masters in norwegian on a very technincal subject , the words got pretty long pretty fast . 
  he also disliked cats most of his life . 
  [ still going strong ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0tsfqtulm8 ) though not a lot of the bands are still playing classic bm . 
  more like blackened [ something ] metal . 
  whats not to be excited about ?

  it was a typo i swear !, 
  i will punish myself now . 
  i 've worked a lot in an international environment . 
  we have divisions in china and brazil and we also build stuff in indonesia , spain etc. 
  i think the difference in education shows more clearly in the work place . 
  ( generalization follows  if you tell an asian engineer or technician to do something you will get bombarded with questions because they want to know every minute detail of what they are supposed to do .
