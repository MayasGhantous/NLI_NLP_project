  [ ww2 heavy water sabotage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage ) 3 . 
  [ norway - brazil 2-1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfzasqvet0w ) at wc98 let the patriotism begin !, 
  we treated the samis pretty bad at times . 
  especially after the [ kautokeino uprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kautokeino_rebellion ) and then there was the whole plundering and raping in the viking age thing . 
  and what a glorious time it was . 
  until denmark . 
  because no-one else would play them basically . 
  and then kazakhstan are too , and they are definitely in asia, 
  anywhere i think . 
  its pretty trivial to collect them i guess , but its probably there just to stop people from forming thousands of pointless parties . 
  i think you 'd have to start a one man party . 
  `` kystpartiet '' [ ( the coastal party ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coastal_party ) was more or less just one very charismatic guy . 
  one of the biggest parties , the populist right progress party ( frp ) , started out as `` anders lange 's party for a strong reduction in taxes , duties and public intervention '', 
  malysz  pope the man could fly and he had an awesome moustache . 
  talking to god and wearing silly hats is peanuts in comparison . 
  - a document declaring that a political party has been founded - information about who is in the central council of the party - rules of how the central council is elected and who can vote for it ( members ) - 5000 signatures . 
  then when a party is founded local representatives are then voted for and are set up in a list according to this ( plus some without hope of being elected are usually filled in ) . 
  and adam malysz !, 
  mandatory as fuck . 
  and also incredibly boring and poorly organised . 
  12 months minus change . 
  and then a lifetime for us lucky few that are selected for the home guard ( * sigh * ), 
  twice i think , and then someone did it accendentilly on a snowmobile . 
  and during an winter exercise a tank with some professional soldiers went through the ice and two people lost their lives , probably a pretty terrible way to go :( yeah , its probably about the same except for colder and with more hills to walk up and down . 
  moneyco ? 
  eeeeeemil !, 
  if i 've learned something in life its to not google image random things . 
  and those guys in the first video are like norways monty python  they are not doing it correctly anyway , thumb should be in , hand should be slightly inclined forward and not touch the hat . 
  [ like demonstrated by our mighty king ] ( http://p3.no/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/harald.jpg ), 
  yes . 
  at least i did . 
  though we mostly walked around on snow shoes and rode snowmobiles . 
  i 've even shot a rocket launcher wearing snow shoes . 
  we also did [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/xzuzn_4zy5w?t=1m25s ) , which is about as cold as i 've gotten ( except for when i took a poo outside in -43 c ) . 
  and yes they were cold and winy ( it was only a mild -20 c that week ) and could n't even stand upright on skis on flat ground . 
  i 've been on winter exercise with danish soldiers . . eehh . 
  lets just have this war in summer ok ? 
  well since you ask so nicely : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nmk0vwb4oi edit : on second thought we will send one man and one man only : [ l\u00e6ffy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp1yclqxd1q ), 
  if hes going to scandinavia the best idea is to look for a job before he gets here . 
  firstly he probably wo n't get a visa without a job and secondly living here without one will be expensive as faen . 
  this time we wont help you ( eat lingonberries in the forest and then go home ) . 
  masters programs are mostly in english if there are foreign students and some handful of bachelors programs : http://www.studyinnorway.no/what-can-i-study/undergraduate-studies . 
  still free in norway . 
  its like sweden , only with more rain and less moose . 
  as a westerner i 'll be rowing to shetland ( shorter than going to sweden anyway ) . 
  those eastern closet danes can think up something for themselves . 
  we are torn between our love of ( black ) gold and our love of swedes . . p.s : pls gib back jemtland og herjedalen ( og bohuslen ), 
   this makes it perfectly proper to use `` danskj\u00e4vlar ! '', 
  as the cry of frustration when debugging someone elses code written in those languages . 
  this is hereby integrated in my work process . 
  in the spirit of nordic one-upmanship i 'd just like to point out that we invented object oriented programming : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simula, 
   it 's because of the historical precedent regarding how states were created . 
  and indeed how some are today . 
  i think that its just the whole `` abolition of the state '' thing that seems a bit ridiculous to me . 
  what these countries need is not a lack of state but rather one that is better , more lawful and with a flatter structure . 
  when you discuss this stuff on reddit , some ( strawmen  ) people seem to be like `` hurr durr state bad , freedom ( market mostly ) good '' . 
  its annoying . 
  freedom is of course good , but it does n't exclude a strong and fair state sector , rather i think it might be a prerequisite to actually having and keeping freedom . 
   the word you were looking for is `` sovereignty '' . 
  the problem with this definition is that it presupposes a separation between the state and its citizenry . 
  in my mind it does n't necessarily presuppose a separation between state and citizens . 
  but of course this is not the case in a lot of countries . 
  `` we are all the state , and the state is us '' i think i 'm probably colored by the fact that i 'm from a very small egalitarian country where the `` distance '' between politicians and common people seems very small . 
  the state does n't seem like a separate entity to me in the same degree as it would for someone from a more autocratic or elite-run society . 
   if your definition of state is `` laws = some sort of state '' then obviously your definition differs from what most anarchists use . 
  i have to say i rarely take the time to discuss anarchism here on reddit . 
  firstly because i 'm no expert but secondly because most `` anarchists '' seem to confuse `` state '' with some sort of autocratic or extremely hierarchical or unlawful unfair society . 
  which of course is the case some places , like for instance russia throughout most of its history . 
  if i remember webers definition of the state a state is an entity that has suverenity ( right translation ? ), 
  and a monopoly on the use of force . 
  so to enforce laws you obviously need force , and since laws by definition should apply to everyone to be fair you need a `` common force '' to do it . 
  but yes anarchy is fun to think about and its ideas about personal freedom and flat structures should certainly be important to any modern society and state . 
  it worries me a bit that europe seems to be heading to a more centralised power structure :(, 
   anarchism holds the state to be undesirable , unnecessary , or harmful . 
  laws = some sort of state . 
  and just because there is a state does n't mean there are rulers . 
  in theory there could be a perfect democracy where all are equal ( in practice there is of course some varying degree of hierarchy ) . 
  in my opinion an `` anarchistic '' society is a very theoretical exercise , which cant really exist unless you had infinte resources and space . 
  ( like ian m. banks ' `` the culture '' ) . 
  i guess thats what happens when you 're always hungary . 
  mostly all of it . 
  the system works and has for a while . 
  its not particularly expensive for society compared to a privatized alternative ( parts of it is privatized anyway ) and the quality is pretty good . 
  in addition most people in scandinavia would tend to see health care as a human right that should be available to all . 
  i think the positive effect of this is that you get more focus on preventative medicine , workers are generally healthier because they have access to health care , so society runs better because less people stay sick for economic reasons . 
  it also gives everyone a feeling of living in a more egalitarian society . 
  `` damn you 're a good horsecock . '', 
  - `` the devil '' , the most common sjitt / shit/dritt/drit - shit obviously satan helvete - hell ** strengthening words : ** j\u00e6vla - the devils forpult ( e ) - fucked or overfucked even ** nice things to call people : ** fitte - cunt kuk - cock fittetryne - cuntface hestkuk - horse cock ( could be an endearing term if you are up north ) kukpeis - ? 
  kuklest - cocksock forpulte fittetryne - fucked cuntface rass - ass r\u00e6vh\u00f8l / rassh\u00f8l - asshole r\u00e6vtryne - assface ( or pigs snout really ) etc etc and you should always try to combine as many as possible : j\u00e6vla forpulte r\u00e6vfittetryne for example . 
   it is expensive and -- even worse -- it kills innocent people . 
  stopped reading right there :d, 
  and the netherlands are still smaller than norway + sweden ( 1020 billion ) or sweden + denmark ( 840 billion ) with about the same population . 
  we 're rich bitch . 
  it does n't seem improbable that poland will grow to a greater economic power than some of the failing southern european economies like spain . 
  they still probably have a lot higher standards of living than a most countries around the world . 
  it could have * some * bearing on the case . 
  i 'd maybe say switzerland was a better bet , though i do n't think it would be impossible for him to get asylum in norway if he applied from within the country . 
  it would be a bit of a risk though . 
  his application would not be a purely political decision , it would be mostly treated by beaurocrats as far as i know . 
  the state secretary of justice says it will be turned down because you ca n't apply for asylum to norway from abroad .
