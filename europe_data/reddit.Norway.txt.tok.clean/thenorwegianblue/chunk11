  http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/verden/1.11111458 also we 're in nato . 
  however we do n't extradite anyone to the us if there is any chance of a death penalty , not relevant here , but we 're not entirely in the americans pocket . 
  as far as i know the spelling : colour vs color etc was just a fuck you to england by a guy who wrote dictionaries . 
  thats pretty much how american english was invented . 
  if i saw one out in the woods i 'd call it `` en j\u00e6vla stor hjort '' . . 
  so once again europe is correct and america somehow messed up the names . 
   the animal bearing the scientific name alces alces is known in britain as the `` elk '' , [ 2 ] and in north america as the `` moose '' . 
  and in sweden/norway its called \u00e4lg / elg, 
  we pay almost as much per capita to the eu as gb does . 
  its like norway , only more crowded , warmer and more conservative . 
  yes ? 
  [ lene alexandra - my boobs are ok ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zb7fjb_ppq ) and some milder and admittedly maybe better quality stuff : [ tone damli - imagine ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mjcqztct5a ) [ alexandra joner - come inside me ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azhmtbuedvi ) not entirely sure who it appeals to , i sort of got it before the internet was around , but now , who knows ? 
  possibly like prim ? 
  if so yes , and i have also made it once with my grandmother . 
  swedish problems . 
  or nordic problems rather . 
  white bread plebs . 
  [ grovbr\u00f8d with brunost ] ( http://www.tine.no/imageresize/142506_695_739.png ), 
  has to do with some very hot weather in russia i think . 
  supposedly its pushing warm air over scandinavia while pushing the cold air down to europe . 
  unusual , but its not the first time it happens . 
  seems to be over now ( here at least ) . 
  11 degrees and rain outside : / edit : finland is still hot as perkele though http://i.imgur.com/vqszqny.png, 
  ( are you guys playing with your dolls ? ), 
  not an improbable thing to say to children anyway . 
  but : e e i \u00c5 . e e i \u00c5 e \u00e5 . 
  ( i am in \u00c5 ( a place in lofoten ) ) ( i am in \u00c5 as well ) could potentially in other dialects be : '' \u00c6 e i \u00c5 '' , or `` i e i \u00c5 '', 
  damn gypsie muslims stole the weather from greece and brought it up north to sell it on the black market . 
  we 've certainly not built some kind of giant sun diversion mirror in space . 
  who gave you such a preposterous idea ? 
  we 've had summer in norway as well . 
  shocking to say the least . 
  yeah , i seem to remember looking for a butcher in trondheim and never finding one : / . 
  still there is of course fresh fish at ravnkloa and fiskehallen and fresh produce ( in season ) at rotvoll landhandel and bondens marked . 
  for meat i guess your best bet is to venture into strindamarka and wrestle a moose to the ground with your own hands . 
  luckily i 'm back in the civilised world , and i do know how to make dark bread . 
  eat it with brown cheese or leverpostei . 
  we have at least three in \u00c5lesund , and in the store you can buy stuff from local producers like ole ringdal . 
  :d where do you live ? 
  900 types of sugary candy cereal . 
  0 types of dark bread . 
  never have i missed home so much . 
  most are from poorer nations ( especially romania ) , just like here in norway . 
  some are drug addicts here , but they often get by on welfare and selling magazines instead , dont know how that is in switzerland . 
  i say , jolly good show lads . 
  the only way this could have been more british is if they all put aside their grievances and decided to invade france ( through belgium ) . 
  this is the case in norway as well . 
  second and third generation immigrants are getting secularlized ( except for small pockets of radicalized youth ) . 
  seems like something similar to what happened the last hundred years with the christian church , most became secularised but some turned to more extreme forms of christianity . 
  research here in norway has shown that immigrant groups are secularized at the same rate as the rest of society ( but many start out as more religious ) . 
  so likely the secularization will continue . 
  what is evident is that new-age pick and choose home made religion seems to be getting more popular ( and moronic ), 
  in climate i think the coast of northern spain and france . 
  in terms of culture , hard to say , but san fransisco felt kind of european when i was there . 
  maybe amsterdam or copenhagen . 
  the rest of california seemed very american to me so i 'm not quite sure what to compare it with . 
  we do enjoy a good circlejerk . 
  as a small country we welcome any attention at all . 
  not the butt cheek :p i 'm just trying to convey that its not with the whole body . 
  like a european kiss but without the kiss . 
  just like ( us ) norwegians mostly ca n't pronounce the difference between ` v ' and ` w ' . 
  if its a close friend a hug on the cheek is normal , if its someone not close you shake their hand . 
  boroussia i think , though i 'm pretty neutral . 
  except that people fuck themselves up so much that they dont contribute to society and even become a burden for everyone else . 
  ( i 'm mostly talking about heroin ) . 
  i would say that the caspian sea is the border and that armenia and azerbaijan are the last european countries . 
  of course they have a lot in common with their neighbours to the south , which are definitely not european , but what else can you expect . 
  meh , we have one of the highest life expectancies in the world . 
  my grandfather for instance worked on the farm until he was over 90 years old . 
  i guess you can live and have a good life in almost any climate . 
  western norway , we have the same weather all year round : http://i.imgur.com/7q0pd.gif it only gets slightly warmer and brighter in summer and colder and darker in winter . 
  but but but , they ^ are ^ black . 
  yay , dark blue for me !, 
  incidentally we just had three days with 25 + sunny weather , so the summer is basically over , back to rain . 
  so if someone is born in spain to spanish parents , and then moves abroad never learning the spanish language and growing up in a different culture with little connection to spain , what are they then ? 
  what i enjoy about the eurovision is that so much of it is so unironically camp , but ( most ) who like it do so with great sense of irony . 
  ( also gay opera vampires ), 
  and they 're almost empty anyways , so sweden would hardly notice if we did a little invasion . 
  well iceland were pretty poor , mostly because denmark exploited their trade http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish-icelandic_trade_monopoly , in addition to plagues , pirates , and volcanic eruptions . 
  if you value material things it certainly is . 
  more like `` poor '' . 
  we had a distinct lack of rich people , but the average person in norway was n't really that poor . 
  pp was average for western europe in the 1800s according to most sources . 
  finland , ireland and iceland ( i think ) all had hunger crises during that period . 
  likely the density of domesticated reindeer is higher than for people !, 
  i estimated it to about 2.5 / km2 . 
  at 9 / km ^ 2 ( 23 / sq mi ) its certainly lower than norway as a whole ( 15 / km ^ 2 ) , but the population density of for example our northernmost county finnmark is a mere 1.52 / km ^ 2 ( 3.9 / sq mi ) and our second northernmost troms is 6/km ^ 2 . 
  together they are about the size of scotland . 
  i 've made some stuff that was as at least as good as most the stuff you get in stores , its all about clean equipment , good raw materials and right temperatures . 
  norway is well worth a visit ( if i must say so myself ) , would love to visit australia once as well . 
  was supposed to go there for work in january , but got sick so someone else went : /, 
  very typical for 0.5 l ( 4,7 % ) in a pub or bar . 
  though you can find it cheaper and certainly more expensive . 
  in the grocery store it costs about 25 nok , or about 4 aud . 
  making your own has come in to fashion in the last few years and then of course its as cheap as in any country ( unless you count labor  ) . 
  we did 1 plus kinda half of 2 . 
  also copied swedens formula . 
  been playing on the radio for a while and already annoyed the fuck out of me : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hnc6t3cozo, 
  catchy dance tune 2 . 
  pretty woman 3 .
