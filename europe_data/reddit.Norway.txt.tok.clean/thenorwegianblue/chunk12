  some kind of folk instrument, 
  http://www.ssb.no/energi-og-industri/statistikker/elektrisitetaar/aar/2013-03-20?fane=tabell&amp;sort=nummer&amp;tabell=104192 2011 : export : 14 329 gwh import : 11 255 gwh we do export quite a bit to sweden , but we also import some back , so it evens out . 
  we are in a common market and therefor import/export is used to even out supply . 
  source : trust me i 'm an engineer :p and here is an article about norwegian dams saving energy : http://www.tu.no/energi/2012/03/02/slik-kan-norge-forsyne-europa-med-energi, 
  this is n't done . 
  it has been suggested though . 
  we have net export ( so its actually more than 100 % of consumption ) , but in winter we need to import because the dams are frozen . 
  we get something back for living in an permanent drizzle . 
  it was 11 eurocents / kwh in norway in 2012 ( 4th quarter ) ( including all taxes and `` hire '' for the powergrid ), 
  you should learn some math before making such comments . 
  i doubt very much that any other name will pass 1 % . 
  how much would i pay for a pub crawl with vodka ? 
  exactly $ 0, 
  hopefully the polar bears wo n't be confused and end up in my front yard . 
  old \u00c5lesund is best \u00c5lesund !, 
  clipfish capital of the world and maybe the best preserved `` art noveau '' / `` jugend '' city in the world . 
  black metal bands do n't discriminate , they hate everyone . 
  also there is a certain degree of provocation just for provocations sake . 
  its my impression that its much more common to rent in sweden than in norway in denmark . 
  thus you are paying some guys business loan instead of a mortage . 
  what was your project ? 
  `` how bad can i make a survey ? '', 
  [ h\u00e5vard rugland ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdwbjhv8jlo ) from norway also signed for some team after gaining youtube fame . 
  but i think that was before the draft , my knowledge of american football comes from a nfl game on snes in the 90s so i 'm not sure i understand the system . 
  this was lovely , 
  my home town of [ geiranger , norway ] ( https://maps.google.no/maps?q=geiranger&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=62.122878,7.172668&amp;spn=0.023437,0.081711&amp;client=opera&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest&amp;hnear=geiranger,+m%c3%b8re+og+romsdal+fylke&amp;gl=no&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=62.122878,7.172668&amp;panoid=aopkn7tqu2vn27e9eiioea&amp;cbp=12,143.6,,0,-10.21 ) !, 
  we 're attempting to have a highly educated population and do high-tech development . 
  we 're also producing a surplus of green energy ( hydroelectric mostly ) , which is expected to grow in the years to come . 
  they buy stocks for the value of the stocks . 
  by active i guess they will get involved in running business and start ups ( but i 'm no economist ), 
  social democrats are n't left wing populists . 
  pretty much [ r\u00e5nere ] ( http://vimeo.com/7470397 ) . 
  while gasoline is expensive in absolute terms in norway its dirt cheap relative to our income . 
  the same goes for food . 
  we spend a very small percentage on our income on food and utilities compared to most any country in the world . 
  hmmm . 
  weird because about every tiny side road in norway is covered . 
  norway : justin bieber has ( finally ) left the country . 
  ( there is much sadness ) we are going to spend a shit ton of money on roads ( but not in oslo , so those guys are angry ) we are building the worlds first ship tunnel ( and its probably of dubious economic value ) people are still smuggling stuff into norway we now like cross country skiing more than football ( not me though ), 
  oh australia , you and your kangaroos . 
  hey me to !, 
  me and the gf went pony trekking for a day ( which i 've never done before ) and we actually saw some musk oxes . 
  my parents have actually just bought a cabin in the southern part there , i kinda picked it because of this , 
  its cool because it adjusts for the distortion in the mercator projection . 
  also i 've just read the wikipedia article on malta , lovely country and a 100 times more densely populated than norway . 
  not much room for national parks !, 
  a lot bigger : http://mapfrappe.com/?show=9615, 
  oh , what would childhood be without astrid lindgren ( and pettson & findus ) ? 
  but lets not forget the greatest swedish work of all times : ** i am zlatan ** ** by zlatan **, 
  good . 
  could also recommend aksel sandemoses `` vi pynter oss med horn '' ( `` horns for our adornment '' ) . 
  sort of in the same seafaring theme , though not so much a historic novel as a psychological one . 
  born in denmark but most count him as norwegian , opposite of ludvig holberg . 
  `` vi de druknede '' by carsten jensen is pretty great !, 
  `` growth of the soil '' by knut hamsun, 
  well we 've done it to some extent with ever increasing holidays . 
  especially compared to the us . 
  but yes , i would n't mind that either , i value free time a lot more than even more material goods . 
  i quite convinced tora berger is n't actually a human but rather a machine sent from the future . 
  hockey is actually pretty far down the list in norway , though we 've gotten a lot better at it in recent years . 
  in norway its the most popular participant and spectator sport . 
  its probably : 1 . 
  football 2 . 
  cross country skiing and biathlon 3 . 
  handball 4 . 
  hockey 5 . 
  alpine skiing and snowboarding 6 . 
  ski jumping 7 . 
  speed skating 8 . 
  floorball ( ? 
  could be solved by having shorter working days . 
  taking out our increased productivity in free time is a pretty good idea if you ask me . 
  better than sweden . 
  gold 3 . 
  silver 4 . 
  bronze, 
  immigrants : innvandrere ( in-wanderers ) foreigners : utlendinger ( out-landers ) black : m\u00f8rk ? 
  ( dark ) or more colloquially svart ( black ) or a bit racist neger . 
  others i guess are just asians . 
  the thing is it wont be very sudden . 
  it will likely take decades . 
  but we will likely see a reduction in material wealth if not standard of living . 
  norway still has abundant renewable energy and i 'm sure we could find something clever to do with it . 
  in fact a lot of our export driven industry has struggled because of oil exports driving the currency up . 
  besides , norway was n't really a poor underdeveloped country before the oil . 
  we may turn into sweden , finland or denmark . 
  * shudder *, 
  ships and boats . 
  i am the 1.4 %, 
  not if they share . 
  good . 
  try to chase some of the women out to the country . 
  sports , literature and music are unifying globally as well as locally . 
  i can for instance probably walk into a bar in say nairobi or ulan bator and start discussing barcelonas passing style whit a large percentage of the people there . 
  very few sectors are as diverse and international as sports . 
  and while i do pay for my own entertainment , i dont think its a bad thing for society to provide some help for culture , its as good a use of our taxes as any . 
  football on the professional level however needs very little economic help , so state sponsoring in spain is just ridiculous , they make more than enough money commercially . 
  true . 
  i 'm more for building culture facilities that are available for use by the general public . 
  though coming from a small country i think that our cultural production would be very low without grants for authors , artists and athletes .
