  also it does sometime give quality stuff that would n't be produced by a purely capitalistic system ( as they do tend to go for lowest common denominator stuff ) . 
  as a football loving pleb i just accept that society needs some common references to unite us . 
  it creates a sense of cultural , national , international and local unity . 
  its also pretty entertaining . 
  have we seen this before , yes . 
  will it always be that way , probably . 
  so does everything else thats considered culturally important . 
  theater , sports , music , film , ballet , opera etc. 
  i dont think football is in a unique position aside from it being one of the most popular cultural expressions . 
  yes . 
  ( in western norway : not raining = = nice ), 
  no , this is typically something associated with old fascist and communist regimes . 
  in spain its a leftover from the franco days , while in most of the communist bloc countries it disappeared around the fall of the ussr its not entirely uncommon for local government to give away or sponsor real estate for stadiums , though then of course its just similar to other culture politics . 
  bread and circuses . 
  i 'm pretty sure germany will be the leading force in european football in the next few years . 
  which i would n't mind , because you actually run clubs with some reason and rational . 
  also the bundesliga is fun to watch . 
  meanwhile , [ sunny and nice in norway ] ( http://www.yr.no/place/norway/m\u00f8re_og_romsdal/\u00c5lesund/\u00c5lesund/long.html ) feels good . 
  orkneys , autonomous region of norway ? 
  i vote ja !, 
  while were at it , lets get back jemtland and herjedalen . 
  norway big !, 
  yeah , you 'll notice when it says `` pizzameat '' instead of beef or ham . 
  probably some sort of goat/horse/giraffe mix . 
  yes . 
  but the stuff on a lot of those frozen pizzas are `` ham '' . 
  but skinke is ham . 
  meat is 40 % meat , 
  `` ham '' its actually beef ( or horse ) pressed to look like ham . 
  oh , what i would n't join for some butter . 
  * cries and smears whale lard on his brown cheese sandwich, 
  we would totally join the eu if we got a monthly cheese in the mail . 
  horse meat sales in norway tripled ( or something ) after the horse meat `` scandal '' . 
  i guess sometimes you 're so hungry you could eat a horse . 
  norway : making sweden and finland not look like a penis since 1905, 
  norway is missing anyway , since its only the eu-27 . 
  not that it would make a lot of difference , seeing as the country is extremely sparsely populated . 
  giant * viking * space ship . 
  there are monestaries on mars right ? 
  actually we do a shit ton of r&d in offshore and maritime technolocy . 
  but the income from oil is so large that it skews the number . 
  also we have some pretty decent electronics companies like atmel avr and nordic semiconductor  edit : also we make a lot of weapons : /, 
  this is true , though it could still be higher in my opinion . 
  we need to build for the future . 
  my impression is that it is genuinely higher in sweden and finland . 
  we are coasting too much on the oil . 
  with unemployment as high as it is now i can only assume that people are spending their time watching history channel . 
  ancient aliens man . 
  troll harder . 
  norway is a great place to live , except maybe for the weather, 
  cool . 
  work with a lots of guys who went there , seems to be a decent school . 
  there are some others with similar programs , though i 'm not 100 % on which . 
  hey man . 
  in ( digital ) ee from the norwegian university of technology and science ( ntnu ) and partly danish university of technology ( dtu ) . 
  you could try norway , education is free and the quality is decent . 
  though living expenses are quite high , so you probably need to work on the side unless you have rich parents . 
  classes are taught in english if there are non-norwegian students . 
  also the job market for ee is great in norway right now , so if you want to stay for a job after education there is opportunities for that . 
  check out http://www.ntnu.edu/ edit : ah , i just saw that you wanted a b.sc. , they have those at [ h\u00f8gskolen i bergen ] ( http://www.hib.no/studier/studie.asp?studieid=eel ) at least as well as some other places . 
  there is also a b.sc . 
  in automation at [ h\u00f8gskolen i \u00c5lesund ] ( http://www.hials.no/nor/hials/student ) . 
  b.sc . 
  courses are often in norwegian though . 
  here its between $ 6 and $ 12 : / . 
  still , i can buy six times as many pints in a month as a belarusian nurse . 
  thats good to know , i guess . 
  oats , milk and strawberry jam . 
  also coffee . 
  what is this ? 
  fascism for ants ? 
  legal limit of horsemeat in other meats : 100 % . 
  problem is of solve . 
  traditonally know in norway as `` karsk '' . 
  a proper one is made with homemade liquor . 
  using store bought liquor is frowned upon and may get you some unfortunate labels in the local community . 
  god damn office coffee . 
  luckily we have a moccamaster in the cafeteria , so i get a nice cup for lunch , but the machine in the hallway is just so damn convenient . 
  and whoevers not queuing properly are italians . 
  and when i visited italy i really enjoyed your coffee , though i think you have too much sugar in your breakfast foods . 
  but americano isnt drip brew , its rather watered out espresso . 
  not as good as a proper drip brew . 
  on a side note , american drip brew is crap , more like a weak tea than coffee . 
  oh we 're coming for you finland , one cup at the time . 
  to be serious they always win tests . 
  it supposedly always has the correct temperature and `` contact time '' between coffee and water . 
  they 're also incredibly reliable and well engineered . 
  ( hand controlled by old dutch ladies i think ) http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/01/12/tema/klikk/bolig/interior/hus/9902376/, 
  drip brewed on a [ technivorm moccamaster ] ( http://www.clasohlson.com/medias/sys_master/8886214656030.jpg ) the only correct way to drink coffee . 
  [ spray can `` cheese '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxwvl7n7ncq ), 
  delicious brown cheese ... mmmmm, 
  the southern tip of greenland is about as high as oslo and stockholm . 
  so not really north . 
  a lot colder though . 
  minus latvia and lithuania and i agree . 
  estonia can into northern europe . 
  just read that the biggest immigrant group in sweden are swedes returning from abroad . 
  probably something similar going on, 
  i cant explain why but thats just how it is in most countries . 
  in norway the suicide rate is something like four times higher for men compared to women .
