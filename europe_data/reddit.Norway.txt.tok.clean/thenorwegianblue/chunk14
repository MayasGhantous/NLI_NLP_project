  a lot of male suicides are also commited by car accident . 
  they leave a letter and then crash into a wall , so there are probably quite a few that are recorded as accidents . 
  if you have a [ european health card ] ( https://tjenester.nav.no/helsetrygdkort/forside.do ) youll be fine for health care in the eu . 
  i travel on business a lot and my advice is to get it anyway , its pretty cheap and you never know if youll lose a cellphone or computer or something . 
  but guyana , sri lanka , croatia , uruguay and south africa are all pretty high ? 
  so it must be just reggae then . 
  ( also possibly not very good statistics , either that or you 've just stumbled on to the cure for depression ), 
  no , its always been a myth , propagated by some very right wing us politician to dismiss social democracy . 
  the scandinavian countries have also always been very good at recording statistics , so it skewed the numbers because we simply registered more . 
  also suicide is n't as much of a taboo as it is in catholic countries . 
  this comic combined with a biography about napoleon has thaught me everything i currently know about corsica . 
  [ wikipedia : list of countries by suicide rate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) sitting nicely in 16th . 
  also the us is higher than sweden , despite all those ridiculous myths about depressed scandinavians killing ourselves . 
  edit : also norways number is wrong . 
  it should be 11.76 , not 15, 
  greece ~ ~ trolls ~ ~ actually sends something decent to the eurovision song contest . . 
  i liked it . 
  better than our boring electro pop singing lady stuff . 
  fun fact : its not really a cheese . 
  and handball after that i think . 
  yeah , brunost is milder in taste . 
  its actually the last in a series , the first one was a 134 hour live transmission of a passenger ferry travelling up the norwegian coast : http://nrk.no/hurtigruten/, 
  you can do it with both warm smoke and cold . 
  salmon and mackrel ( ? ), 
  are both typically warm smoked and cold smoked . 
  ive read some interesting articles that claim that our vocabulary is becoming more standardized while we keep a lot of the dialectic pronunciation . 
  probably because the population is more educated an more exposed to media than before . 
  thats a very good point . 
  also modern forms of communication are making dialects disappear ( or at least making them weaker ) over here ( sadly ) , so i doubt that america will ever develop as diverse dialects as found in some european countries . 
  here in norway we had very isolated communities for a long time because of our topography and its made dialects extremely diverse , you can travel between towns that are 30 minutes apart and hear big differences . 
  within an hour of where i live there are at least four different ways of saying `` i '' . 
  [ norway ] ( http://www.ssb.no/emner/02/01/10/innvbef/fig-2012-04-26-02.html ) . 
  if anyone wants to fill it out . 
  i find that differences in accents in the us are actually less pronunced than accents in a lot of other countries . 
  everyone seem to at least speak with a pretty standardized vocabulary , which isnt the case at all here in scandinavia . 
  i 'm only pining for the fjords . 
  give land ? 
  i 'd say there was a lot less populism in politics and media ( maybe ) . 
  also we 've gotten very rich and a lot more centralized and urbanized . 
  while janteloven is a factor in scandinavia it certainly has n't stopped us from producing some truly extraordinary people , like ibsen , kierkegaard , nobel , amundsen etc. 
  i think we sometimes exagerrate its importance . 
  there is quite a lot of room for individualism . 
  it used to be stoicism , pietism and collective thinking ( with a few very notable exceptions ) . 
  now we are more about individualism , and society seems to get less egalitarian . 
  what caused it ? 
  harsh weather , difficult land and large distances . 
  norway : northerners : loud , foul mouthed , drunken fishermen . 
  middle ( tr\u00f8ndelag ) : moustached , home made liquor drinking , hard to understand farmers . 
  north-west ( m\u00f8re ) : stingy complaining rich fishermen . 
  west ( bergen ) : ca n't say r properly , always talking , too high confidence east : inlanders are hicks and people from oslo are snobby bastards who think they are cultured and that oslo is a big city . 
  people from oslo consequently think everyone outside oslo are moonshine drinking farmers . 
  as a renault owner i understand why they are failing . 
  its just a terribly designed car . 
  i often find myself wondering what the hell the engineers who built it where thinking . 
  german or japanese for me the next time . 
  i suggest flattening a small eastern european country and making a giant flywheel . 
  this can not fail . 
  but seriously . . water reservoirs can work . 
  personally i 'm only resting . 
  you mean like some sort of hydroelectric power ? 
  now why has n't anyone thought of that before ? 
  the main reason for immigrating to norway is work : http://www.ssb.no/innvandring/fig5-grunn.gif most immigrants now are craftsmen and unskilled workers from eastern europe . 
  i actually think it looks pretty good , but then again i dont mind functionalistic architecture . 
  there are certainly worse buildings in oslo . 
  [ ten ugliest buildings in norway ] ( http://www.nrk.no/kultur-og-underholdning/1.7142708 ) . 
  ok list though some are a bit political . 
  personaly i have my money on [ \u00c5lesund city hall ] ( https://www.google.no/search?client=opera&amp;q=r%c3%a5dhuset%20i%20%c3%a5lesund&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=nn&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=ltaquy3yocnn4qtg6od4ba&amp;biw=1887&amp;bih=987&amp;sei=mdaquadhdaor4atpsohycg ) . 
  especially in contrast with the rest of the city , which is quite lovely . 
  it would probably completely ruin norwegian agriculture . 
  it would be more or less impossible to compete with the big industrial farms on the continent . 
  social democracy actually advocates a peaceful democratic transition from capitalism to socialism . 
  they are ( at least ideologically ) democratic socialists . 
  in practice of course , they are democratic so they are moderated by opposing parties to the right , making a complete transition to socialism unrealistic . 
  i come from the area of europe with the most rain and the most jobs . 
  i am confused . 
  we also contribute as much per person as the uk . 
  i know that my company has built some ships there in the past . 
  seemed very industrialized around bilbao . 
  not really , stephen fry was at least pronouncing the \u00d8 as a long sound , but the double f implies that its short . 
  the pronunciation is very similar to `` bluff '' in english . 
  loud noises !, 
   bl\u00f8ff bl\u00f8ff bl\u00f8ff is actually norwegian for bluff , if anyone was wondering . 
  just leaving a century with famine in several countries , massive emigration to america and on the brink of two world wars and massive genocide . 
  remember that africa is a huge continent , and not every country is somalia . 
  with their enormous natural resources and slowing growth in population they might see something similar to the development asia has had in the last 30 years . 
  still plaged by war , corruption and aids though :(, 
  look at where europe was a hundred years ago . 
  you never know . 
  i dont get what you 're saying nope to . 
  you are more or less agreeing with me . 
  these groups have a better starting point than more recent asylum seekers , relatively modern jugoslavia compared to the failed states of somalia and afghanistan . 
  most of our recent immigrant boom has been work migrants from poland , sweden and lithuania anyway , not much of a problem there . 
  http://www.ssb.no/innvandring/fig5-grunn.gif except for those damn party-swedes, 
  afghanis and somalis are very new immigrant groups . 
  what im talking about is second and third generation immigrants . 
  taking in somalis and afghans is a humanitarian project ( the effectiveness of which can be discussed ) , and while we should try our best to make them productive citizens in the first generation , i just dont think we can expect it . 
  well , some people will always cling to conservative notions . 
  in general though i think western societies are turning more secular , and that includes immigrants from muslim countries . 
  the difference is that in general they start from typically more conservative points than average . 
  part of a package i guess .
