  would they even notice though ? 
  i think ` hipster ' is such a loose term its hard to even call it a sub culture . 
  its just urban people with varying interests and fashionable clothing . 
  then again i 'm kind of a hipster , so i would say that . 
  have recently driven in southern italy , can confirm . 
  its low , but livable as long as you do n't want an appartment in the centre of one of the ` big ' cities . 
  we mostly use electricity for heat in norway . 
  in general everything is expensive in norway if you view it from abroad . 
  salary 5500 $ ( engineer in marine sector ( m.sc ) ) taxes : 2100 $ loan payments for house : 900 $ student loan payments : 200 $ electricity : 200 $ food : 600 $ gasoline : 2-300 $ municipal expences : 100 $ various insurances : 150 $ shitty renault break downs : ?? 
  eur left over : 1300 $ ( minus clothes and stuff like that ), 
  worked out fine for between-wars-germany . 
  i would never vote for hillary or trump tbh . 
  sanders does n't seem to stand a chance anyway so its really a moot point . 
  but thinking that a populist like trump is going to do anything to `` crack down '' on other rich people is pretty naive in my opinion . 
  he seems like the type of person that will say just about anything if it gives him an advantage . 
  and the cheap rhetoric about building walls ( and having mexico pay for it ( lol ) ) etc is just dumb . 
  generally he also just seems like a childish bully , not traits you 'd want in someone as head of any country imo . 
  and who knows what his real policies on the middle east would be , he has no experience with anything close to it . 
  being a decent businessman is in no way the same as being a good politician . 
  yeah , because electing business men always works :d they tend to just use power to make themselves and others like them even richer . 
  that would be completely and utterly wrong !!, 
  should obviously be some kind of moon . 
  not in norway , you 'd expect to pay $ 300k at least for something like that , but in finland i 'd guess its what a house costs . 
  [ this is what $ 220k would get you in my small town ] ( http://m.finn.no/realestate/homes/search.html?location=0.20015&amp;location=1.20015.20282&amp;price_collective_from=1700000&amp;price_collective_to=1800000 ) of about 60 000 people . 
  mostly 2 or 3 bedroom appartments . 
  also no florida man, 
  as long as you can sell you can also do that with a mortage . 
  and then you also get back your down payments on the loan ( just not the interest ), 
  i would assume it 's all from the bank . 
  he would be too young to have paid off a house . 
  [ these little guys ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=gressklipper+robot&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;rlz=1c1blwb_enno527no527&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=665&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjs3eintjjmahufkiwkhtbedt8q_auibigb ), 
  yeah , something like that . 
  i 'm no economist so you 'll have to take what i say with a grain of salt , but i know the tax is very high . 
  marginal, 
  oil companies in norway are taxed at about 75 %, 
  [ :( ] ( https://heathenharvest.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/varg-vikernes.png ), 
  that being said the town i now live in burned almost completely to the ground in 1904 ( rumor has it it started at a party in a factory ) . 
  then again i do n't think they worried to much about fire safety back then . 
  300 g double roll pack ( could n't find single ) costs about 50 nok or about $ 6 . 
  there are probably some `` oreos '' that are a lot cheaper though . 
  yeah , my uncle has a wooden shed that is n't even painted and has been barely maintained that is still standing after 160 years . 
  norways oldest wooden building is approaching its 900 year anniversary !, 
  the wooden towers will be more common in the future , its a newish technique of building with glued together `` massive '' pieces of engineered wood . 
  seeing it more and more in norway . 
  and probably a cabin somewhere as well as maybe a small boat . 
  its pretty common yes . 
  unless you live in the centre of one of the biggest cities , then it could be an appartment instead ( without the cars etc ) . 
  i 'd say a working class person could also have those things ( at least someone with a profession like plumber or carpenter ) . 
  it 's super common in the nordics ( except denmark and iceland i guess ) norway has got the [ world tallest wooden building ] ( http://img.gfx.no/1816/1816166/1200048004.1000x667.jpg ) as well, 
  less expensive than here actually . 
  good thing i drive a hybrid . 
  i think i 've read somewhere that petrol is subzidised in the us ( ? ), 
  here it 's the other way around . 
  ah , ok . would still be a bit low in norway , but makes more sense  sorry about your dad , that is a very young age to lose him :(, 
  all hail the moccamaster !, 
  i have one and my grandma has one that has been chugging along since the early 80s . 
  makes coffee just as good as my chemex . 
  yeah , saw him mention lower down that they made 30k-35k $ a year together . 
  that would be very very low in norway . 
  could n't afford much more than one bedroom appartment , even in a small town . 
  then again , cost of living evens it out quite a bit i would guess . 
  could easily have been a norwegian home in a norwegian town ( aside from the sauna  ), 
  nordic roasts are pretty light . 
  much lighter than espresso roasts . 
  its normal coffee , but you need to have about 12 cups of it . 
  looks pretty solidly middle class ( in norway ) to me . 
  slight difference between the countries probably . 
  if you live in a smaller town like this guy ( and myself ) , you can afford all of this pretty easily . 
  over three years 2016-2019, 
  when people talk about countries spending huge numbers like that i always like to check what it costs each individual citizen . 
  10 000 a year would be the equivalent of 2-3 % tax increase ( just wildly speculating the average pay in sweden ) . 
  would certainly be noticeable . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with the `` free immigration '' people , it does bring with it some economical and cultural issues that we need to be aware of and handle in a good way , but we 're very far from some kind of `` disaster '' or `` collapse '' . 
  i really doubt it . 
  it 's a developed country with a strong democratic traditions and innovative businesses . 
  the fertility rate is normal for a developed country . 
  all of western europe will face some problems similar to japans with their age-skewed baby-boomer demographics , but i do n't think sweden is particularly worse off than any other country . 
  the extreme refugee crisis wo n't last forever , and at some point it 'll be back to business as usual . 
  about 10 000 sek per swede per year then . 
  the rain might get slightly warmer at least !, 
  it was n't perfect then and it is n't collapsing now either . 
  it was a good place with a few problems and it still is . 
  we do have some decent incentives here in norway , maybe better than in denmark ( explaining the 0.13 difference ) , but we could certainly turn it up higher if we wanted to . 
  as of today i do n't really see a pressing need , but it 's a possible and well known solution if we get some bad demographic problems . 
  it generally is low , but that 's something that seems to come with being a developed country . 
  if you look at this list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate , the nordic countries are in the top of the developed countries . 
  the top 100 is all developing countries . 
  if the state really wanted to incetivise more births it probably could . 
  do n't think it will ever be a real crisis . 
  its worse for the eastern european countries that are losing all their young people . 
  or things will have slightly changed in some direction . 
  the options are n't just paradise or total failure . 
  it probably will yes . 
  i also doubt the current refugee crisis will last forever . 
  fertility rates are ok-ish compared to a lot of european countries ( same as the uk , australia , new zealand etc ) . 
  it 'll probably still be pretty great , at least norway still keeps getting more and more secular if that is an issue . 
  there are some issues with the large immigration , but all the scandinavian countries are doing fine and are mostly unchanged and will keep on being fine . 
  yes , there is certainly a big difference in distribution of wealth between the us and ( western ) europe . 
  it kind of ruins these kinds of comparisons . 
  anecdotally i 'd say that its easier to move upward in western europe ( because of things like free education , free healthcare etc ) , but that move upwards is less off a leap economically ( and in terms of lifestyle ) .
