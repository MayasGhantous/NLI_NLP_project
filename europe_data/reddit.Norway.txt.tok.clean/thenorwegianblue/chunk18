  all in all i 'd say it illustrates the different political approaches between the us and western europe more than anything . 
  well it 's missing non-eu countries like norway and switzerland so it 's probably six countries at least . 
  i guess that ` some ' would have been a better word for it . 
  the main point was really that social mobility is probably just as good if not better in europe compared to the us . 
  and yes it contradicts the article to a certain degree , which was kind of the point . 
  also really depends on what you mean with `` tech '' . 
  big companies like siemens are in tons and tons of different tech stuff and volkswagen is the biggest automotive company in the world . 
  i think that its also possible that a lot of the start ups are more limited to the country they are in , which means much smaller markets than the us . 
  i know some of the biggest web services in norway exist almost exclusively here . 
  like komplett.no , finn.no , yr.no etc, 
  i actually think a lot of european countries have better upward mobility than the us . 
  our only one is breivik i guess . 
  other than that the only one i can think of is some gangster types shooting at a synagouge a few years back . 
  and the black metal church burnings of course , though that was 25 years ago . 
  totally agree , if we do n't have our principles then what do we have ? 
  he also seems to be pretty delusional , so he might genuinely feel the state is treating him wrong . 
  indeed , though i think i saw something not long ago about doctors in norway making less than doctors in the uk in absolute terms as well . 
  ( though i might be making that up ), 
  we 've been pretty good at regulating our fisheries in the last decades , and there is also fish farming . 
  its also the case that the wage structure is very flat . 
  dishawashers make more than in most other countries and doctors and engineers make ( relatively ) less . 
  east norway : more like swedes west norway : more like danes middle norway : like the west but more jovial north norway : a bunch of hard drinking , hard cursing fishermen ( so probably icelanders or faroese or something ) its all very subtle differences though , do n't think any foreigner would notice much of it . 
  meh , they are pretty similar to norwegians imo . 
  norway is somewhere between denmark and sweden . 
  i 've lived in all three countries . 
  they 're about as far apart as london and brighton . 
  yeah . 
  two of my neighbours have it . 
  i work in the industry and it is definitely all about korea and china these days ( with some exceptions like the brazillian market where you have to build in brazil ) . 
  would n't hurt if they made some glaciers as well . 
  we have tons of them , how hard can it be ? 
  not any more , but i grew up there . 
  it 's quiet and boring in winter . 
  most people work with tourism . 
  well , we call the portuguese-ish dish with tomatoes and potatoes bacalao mostly , while we call the dried fish klippfisk and the fish torsk, 
  when we call it bacalao its from dried fish , otherwise its just fish , 
  just to expand on that : before dynamite they would turn wood into charcoal , then use that to heat the rock and then make it crack by cooling it with water . 
  required crazy amounts of firewood . 
  we actually do !, 
  i live in \u00c5lesund and we have a restaurant that is dedicated to bacalao . 
  we 've been eating it since the 1800s . 
  true , but that is also true for a lot of countries in europe . 
  norway was pretty average for a western european country , but much better off than the eastern european ones . 
  there is a good reason why the communist revolution happened in russia . 
  you might be thinking of the icelandic author halldor laxness , 
  dollhouse is set in a upper middle class home and is mostly about womens lack of individualism in marriage at the time . 
  it was very controversial at the time . 
  [ thats actually a bit of a myth ] ( http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majormode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=c$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=1800$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=xcoords;iid=phawcnavuyj1jimakmq1img;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=ycoords;iid=phawcnavuyj2tplxkvvnnpa;by=ind$inc_s;univalue=8.21;iid=phawcnavuyj0xoobl_n5taq;by=ind$inc_c;univalue=255;gid=catid0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;datamin=194;datamax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;datamin=23;datamax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=i168_t001800,,,,;modified=75 ) it all depends on who you compare it to though . 
  the fertility rate is high-ish for europe . 
  i 'm doing my bit at least , 
  they represented some useless work and in general he did n't like the sitka spruce much either . 
  as for the second question its a little bit of both as far as i know . 
  i think you get some reward for cutting them down , but they sell the timber as well of course . 
  i 'll just put it here because imgur is blocked where i 'm sitting and i 'll have to do it on my phone otherwise : 1 .

  yes , and bergen was the largest city/town in the nordic countries up til the 1600s for this reason . 
  probably the richest too . 
  yeah , a lot of the `` now '' pics are 10 years old ( and i posted this on reddit four years ago too ) . 
  you can clearly see it on the clothing of the people in the first pic . 
  the source is http://www.tilbakeblikk.no/ probably cheaper in oslo now with the krone being so low . 
  i know you 're joking and the current immigrant circlejerk and all . 
  however : oslo is about 70 % ethnic norwegian ( + 5 % northern european immigrants ) norway has changed quite a lot since the 80s though . 
  we were n't anywhere near as rich when i grew up as we are today and the cities have grown a lot . 
  there were also some big reforsestation projects around the world wars . 
  my granddad planted some spruce in the 50s on some poor farming land that never got used for anything because the timber industry disappeared . 
  he really hated those trees . 
  they planted a lot of sitka spruce that later has been deemed an invasive species , so for the last few years they 've been chopping a lot of it down . 
  less logging , use of firewood and grazing animals . 
  i 've seen a huge change in just the last 20 years . 
  trees grow really quickly when you stop keeping farm animals on the land . 
  currently the same temperature as in porto outside , 
  yes and no . 
  compared to today certainly , but perhaps not compared to a lot of other places in europe at the time . 
  most farmers in norway owned their own land and they could also depend on the sea for food and income . 
  there was n't a lot of wealth perhaps ( though there was some , just look at the style of the [ rebuilding of \u00c5lesund in 1905 ] ( https://www.google.no/search?safe=off&amp;hl=nn&amp;biw=1097&amp;bih=582&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=%c3%a5lesund+%2b+jugend&amp;oq=%c3%a5lesund+%2b+jugend&amp;gs_l=img.3...14753.16532.0.16660.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.j9mokljhadg ) ) , but for the common farmer it probably was n't the worst . 
  its also the period that produced some of norways most famous artists , ibsen , grieg , hamsun etc. 
  got these pics of this website : http://www.tilbakeblikk.no/ a few years back . 
  just saw the other post and i think it has the same source . 
  some randomly chosen locations that i 've been to and recognized, 
  logging , firewood gathering and animals grazing down any new trees . 
  its always very visible in old pictures of rural norway that there are no trees . 
  these pictures take you from a farming country to a post-industrial one , so its perhaps not surprising . 
  posted something similar a while back http://imgur.com/a/ywcuo, 
  it 's also the case that they stopped building new houses during the financial crisis because they thought the market would collapse . 
  instead it grew and now we 're boned . 
  could definitely be both ( ref breivik her in norway ), 
  we also had a couple of games close to it d\u00f8dball ( lit . 
  `` dead ball '' ) and sl\u00e5ball ( `` hit ball '' ) . 
  they were both played with paddles that looked like table tennis paddles and a team mate pitches the ball by throwing it up in the air . 
  there were also six `` bases '' in d\u00f8dball at least and you were `` dead '' if you were caught outside them . 
  we played it in gym class sometimes . 
  they probably are n't as easy to spot since you most likely have to talk to them to separate them from the danes . 
  lots of them in norway as well . 
  lots of swedes too of course, 
  i think if you inspect closer you will find that the substance it is made of is actually high quality shit .
