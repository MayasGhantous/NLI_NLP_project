  if you tell a scandinavian ( or northern european ) to do something they will just say ok and come back in a day with the problem fixed in addition to saying they found x things that we need to improve . 
  went to dtu in denmark for a year as well , pretty similar university system as in norway, 
  shipping , fishing , fish farming , aluminium * . 
  and we 're decent at high tech , plus we have more hydroelectric power than we use .

  we might be at the top of the boom , but its likely to be a long and slow decline ahead of us . 
  as the article states the main issue is that the oil industry has driven up cost for every other industry . 
  if there is a slow decline there is n't any reason why we could n't adjust . 
  of course there would have to change some things , but we were an industrial nation before the oil and we 've been one during the oil . 
  its not like we 're dubai or something . 
  norway was n't really that poor in the 1900s ( at least not after wwi ) , thats just a myth , we were pretty comparable to any other western european state . 
  before that we were pretty poor though ( though thats also debatable , we had better food security than a lot of other countries because of the north sea ) . 
  its a section thats something like 400 pages long in book number six in the series . 
  he goes into stuff about hitlers childhood and stuff . 
  he makes some comparisons to his own life , partly how they both had a terrible relationship to an alcoholic and authoritarian father . 
  hans problemer med \u00e5 knytte seg til andre mennesker , hans kvinneopph\u00f8yning og kvinneangst , hans kyskhet , hans renhetslengsel '' semi-googletranslated :  `` hitlers youth was similar to my own , his distance love , his desperate desire to be something big , to raise himself from himself , his mother 's love , his hate for his father , his use of art as an i-annihilation and the place major emotions . 
  his problems relate to other people , his elevation and anxiety of women , his chastity , his longing for purity ''  `` when i see him on film , he evokes the same in me as my father once did , also there is a similarity . 
  he represented the bourgeois public in much the i know , it 's the indignant voice that says you do not measure . 
  he also represents the exceedance of the same bourgeois public , the young boy who sleep late in the morning and will not have a real job , but who will write or paint , because he is something more and better than the others . '', 
  as said in the other comment he compares himself to hitler . 
  and also just to be a controversial bastard . 
  which he is . 
  i think part of the idea was also to choose a title that is quite clearly an autobiography , but not a normal autobiography . 
  and yes that is what mein kampf is called in norwegian, 
  ian banks is an amazing author . 
  really love his sci-fi stuff as well ( written as ian m. banks for some reason ) . 
  ** norway ** markens gr\u00f8de ( growth of the soil ) ( 1917 ) by knut hamsun . 
  a stoic man moves into the wilderness of norhern norway and builds his own farm and family . 
  it follows his whole life from this point . 
  gives some insight into the nordic mindset ( at least historically ) and conflict between traditional farming live and industrialization . 
  for something more modern . 
  min kamp ( my struggle ) by karl ove knausg\u00e5rd . 
  a pretty insanely detailed autobiography that is extremely well written imo . 
  the reason for it in bergen is that the language was `` simplified '' during the hansa-period . 
  lots of hansa influence in the western norwegian dialects . 
  speaking for norwegian it just comes natural , and it can vary in different dialects as well , 
  and euro 92 . 
  well [ kirkenes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirkenes#history ) is pretty much boned then . 
   russia meanwhile called for norway to clamp down on expressions of religious intolerance and and criticised the country 's child welfare system . 
  they also recommended that norway improve its correctional facilities for those ** applying for asylum status ** they are just being nice thinking of all the russians fleeing from political oppression in russia . 
  yeah that is true to a certain extent . 
  its also an area where the countries differ a bit , sweden and denmark are more centralized than norway ( and iceland i think ) . 
  some say its because of a combination of geography ( distances and topography in norway is extreme ) and history ( being unpopularly ruled from copenhagen for so long ) . 
  the countries are also small enough that you have a sort of `` semi-local '' relationship to national politicians . 
  one interesting side note is that politicians and people in the `` upper class '' almost invariably speak in their own local dialect rather than in some standard or refined norwegian . 
  i 've read that thats not very common elsewhere . 
  there is n't really any reason it should change . 
  our political system prevents anything too radical from happening , politics just shift left or right by a little bit . 
  i think it would take a huge external crisis to break the stability . 
  does n't seem very likely at the moment , but who knows ? 
  and norwegians . 
  and swedes , though not so much in englands case, 
  denmark ii : the hashening, 
   scandinavians do n't eat traditional scandinavian food . 
  they eat the same globalized diet as the rest of you , but with some added traditional elements , such as rye , oats , and lots of fish . 
  and at least we know how to make bread . 
  and some of the traditional stuff is great , 
  sure , crews are already smaller than they used to be , no more manual flipping of valves and the like . 
  all i 'm saying is that `` drone-like '' ship behaviour is pretty unrealistic as it stands today . 
  you also need maintenance of the machinery , cargo systems , fire prevention etc etc. 
  ships will have decent sized crews for a long time . 
  another thing is that ships are n't as mass produced as say automobiles , they are more like factories and there is always a lot variation between them which makes them really hard to standardize and automate . 
  sounds like a cool project , though it sounds like you did n't get it :(, 
  high taxes , state sponsored education , high perception of equality and trust in structures built over time in a society with small distances in the social hierarchy . 
  norway never had much of one anyway . 
  i work in the same town and know a lot of people working for rr marine in \u00c5lesund . 
  that is a very optimistic article to say the least . 
  one thing is captainless , i think we might get there in some time . 
  crewless on the other hand is pretty far off if you ask me . 
  everything is possible of course , but what i 'm saying is that this is n't something thats really close in time . 
  if we manage to automate something like this there wo n't be many jobs left that ca n't be automated . 
  i 'm pretty sure outsiders would have a hard time telling us apart . 
  there are differences of course , but probably more similarities . 
   boat captains etc automated boats as a ship automation engineer i 'm just going to say : not even close in the next 30-40 years . 
  maybe some simple ferries at most . 
  mostly lawns with flowers , but quite commonly some fruit trees ( apples , pears , plums etc ) and berry bushes ( raspberry , redcurrant , even strawberry ) as well . 
  when i was a kid we also tried to have vegetables for a while , but the roe deer kept eating it :( . 
  funny thing is , every time i come to the us it feels like i 've walked into a tv-show . 
  it feels weirdly familiar , yet different . 
  in norway its more like this ( very cool video ) : http://vimeo.com/7470397 newer cars and not as much confederate flags and stuff . 
  if anything its those lazy oslovians that are funded by the rest of us hard working , oil pumping norwegians . 
  * shakes both fists in a southernly direction *, 
  i 'm a casual kind of guy . 
  to be fair to me i only meant that a foreign army could probably occupy finnmark for years without meeting a single person ( 75 000 people in an area bigger than denmark ) . 
  then the mosqituos would take care of them . 
  are you guys annexing finnmark ? 
  because if you are i do n't think a lot of people would notice . 
  well the swedes have taken some chunks out of norway before . 
  sneaky bastards have been lulling us into a false sense of security with their hundred years of neutrality . 
  if i 've learned anything from euiv its to never trust a swede . 
  samis mostly live on the border to russia :| . 
  norway is obviously skewed by oil income , but i 've had a lot of experience working abroad through my work and i think we would still be pretty high up on the list without it . 
  the times i 've been in spain and brazil it seemed like everyone was at work all day without getting much done , really frustrating and a stupid use of peoples time . 
  i 'm sensing some kind of joke that i 'm not getting . 
  the biggest minority in norway are sami ( around 40 000 ) . 
  we have a dark history of oppression when it comes to them , but these days it is n't bad at all . 
  though there is some casual racism and stereotyping going on sometimes . 
  ah , the poor mans iceland . 
  we 'll take it . 
  sweden , norway and iceland were included .
