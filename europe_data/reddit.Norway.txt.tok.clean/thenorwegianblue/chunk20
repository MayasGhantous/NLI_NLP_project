  pepper , pepper , pepper , pepper . 
  yeah . 
  my uncle gave me an electric drill and filled the whole packaging with peppercorns which my parents are still picking out of their carpet . 
  traditionally it was just for ladies as well , making my uncle all the more * hilarious * https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/pepperm%c3%b8, 
  i know in norway there is also a tradition of receiving pepper on your 30th if you 're not married . 
  not done much in practice these days though . 
  the dark ages were probably more held back by constant meaningless wars , feudalism and plague than the catholic church . 
  my dad had one in his grocery store and norsk tipping came in and replaced it with a `` joker poker '' machine . 
  more money to be made/lost i guess . 
  ( hard to flick a 200 kr bill ), 
  pure speculation , but sweden would have had the huge advantage of not being bombed to pieces . 
  much like the us after ww2 . 
  apparantly there are more suicides in summer , so that theory is a bit flawed . 
  suicides increase during holidays . 
  loneliness , free time to think and alcohol/drugs play a part i suspect . 
  probably in a lot of ways , but at the same time we were all making tons of easy money for a good while , which is hard to complain about . 
  was there last summer during a heat wave , definitely got over 40 . 
  it was ok since we were near the sea , but then we went to rome and it was the same temperature . 
  living hell for a northerner . 
  we 're feeling the downturn in the oil price and things have n't been great in western norway , however it gets slightly off set by a boom in fishing and the krone having dropped quite a bit . 
  business in the less oil focused cities ( oslo in particular ) is doing pretty great apparantly . 
  [ the czech were pretty close to western europe ] ( https://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majormode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=c$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=1926$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=xcoords;iid=phawcnavuyj1jimakmq1img;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=ycoords;iid=phawcnavuyj2tplxkvvnnpa;by=ind$inc_s;univalue=8.21;iid=phawcnavuyj0xoobl_n5taq;by=ind$inc_c;univalue=255;gid=catid0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;datamin=194;datamax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;datamin=23;datamax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=i57_t001926,,,,;modified=75 ) , but there was a definite gap between east and west even before wwii, 
  nah , its more like barcelona and gran canaria right ? 
  just read a long article in a norwegian newspaper about there being a serious brain drain from eastern europe ( and poland in particular ) to western europe as well . 
  which is n't good for a country . 
  in norway the [ oslo plaza ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/oslo_plaza ) hotel is the tallest convetional building at 117 m while the [ nexans tower ] ( https://gfx.nrk.no/di6jvtuuzmlf_5opvth5raltahwwhpolewhsv2ezccqw ) is the tallest industrial building at 120 m. 
  its the first destination if you go through russia though . 
  yeah , in my experience nepotism is less expressed in the nordic countries than most other places . 
  it can be as bad for society as pure economic corruption . 
  i 've seen it a lot in brazil , where people get jobs in offshore / ships based on who they know or are related to rather than their actual knowledge and skill . 
  it 's extremely bad for the quality of work . 
  this is completely anectodal , but i just got back from a trip from the us and it feels like a lot of the working class jobs in the us are very `` low quality '' and are fairly unproductive . 
  for example there was a guy at the airport who 's only task was grabbing the bags on the baggage belt and turning the handle out towards people . 
  and you also have people in stores that are just there to greet you when you come in . 
  complete waste of work effort in my eyes . 
  some of those peoples jobs could be replaced by a cardboard sign . 
  it 's a bit different to europe in that there are more visibly poor people and areas while the middle class have fairly high living standards ( though maybe not a life style that most europeans would choose ), 
  a lot of it is probably the value of real estate increasing . 
  which has both good and bad sides . 
  the bad sides is that it 's getting harder and harder to come into the market . 
  in norway we also benefitted a lot from high oil prices ( caused partially by war in the middle east ), 
  its bullshit . 
  they 're still in denmark afaik . 
  if you go about two generations back a lot of people in the nordic countries were fairly poor . 
  however the value of the stuff they owned ( property ) has gone up a lot . 
  i 've also heard from co-workers that its hard to get stuff done in the ukraine without bribing almost everyone you come in contact with . 
  not really relevant for buying a carton of milk , but if you 're buying a 1000 cartons of milk a day as a business there is a cost that 's hidden from statistics like this . 
  not if you get the same deal as us in the eea . 
  or maybe schengen is more relevant , not sure which one decides it . 
  i have to say i just hate the osx ui . 
  we mostly use ubuntu at work and it 's probably the best option if you 're developing software imo, 
  norway is so integrated with the eu we are practically in it . 
  it 's rainy af here so and also lots of trees . 
  so there is kind of bound to be . 
  germany is fascinating . 
  seems like all the players are produced in the south west corner . 
  i doubt it . 
  first of all i doubt any country in northern europe will ever pass 10-15 % muslims and secondly immigrants also go through some secularization as new generations are born and grow up . 
  terrorism comes from a small group of extremists and is of course a big issue , but islam will probably remain a very small political factor in these countries . 
  for some reason i can usually spot a dane . 
  maybe it 's the potato they carry around in their mouth ? 
  in norway they are usually retired couples dressed in all beige clothes . 
  pale , drunk , and wearing all-weather jackets . 
  kvelertak gets play time on the biggest `` pop '' radio stations in norway , and their album is currently 2nd most popular ( behind the most popular current norwegian kygo ) , other than that its a niche genre in the same way as it is in any other country . 
  i guess you know all the big scandinavian ones then ? 
  my norwegian favourites are probably darkthrone , enslaved , immortal , kvelertak a less known one is nekromantheon : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quqyx0dpl6u would also strongly suggest to listen to gylve ` fenris ' nagells ( of darkthrone ) podcast https://soundcloud.com/heavytassen, 
  death , doom , thrash , sludge , or speed are also acceptable , but we prefer them to be both trve and kvlt . 
  one of the worst songs imo . 
  it was all politics . 
  but whatever , got drunk anyways . 
  we have a [ taller mountain ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/place/aksla+utsiktspunkt/@62.4732017,6.1621628,1728m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4616da43e06f7ce5:0xac4e477fec50ff3a!8m2!3d62.4742856!4d6.1640119?hl=no ) * inside * my hometown . 
  i think there 's even a football pitch on it thats higher than the highest point in denmark . 
  it probably has a little to do with it if we 're being honest . 
  though i think proximity is more important as you say . 
   mostly for it is though , very rarely do these things happen in response to the vast majority of terror attacks that occur in the middle east and africa . 
  i guess he could have said `` western europe / north america '' though . 
  there is no doubt that there is a clear bias in our empathy , though it 's not really surprising i guess . 
  the nordics , where spending days alone in a cabin in the mountains without electricity or running water is considered a nice holiday . 
  tax-havens are pretty hard to deal without some big international efforts against them . 
  i do think that hiding your money is n't very common in the nordics , the tax offices have pretty tight control of that stuff . 
  looking at the top 20 richest people in norway it 's really only fredriksen that has done it , ca n't really stop them from `` moving '' to other countries though , it 's legal and people are free to register their companies wherever they want i guess \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  probably like norways real richest guy , who just so happens to be the richest person in cyprus in this map . 
   ok , you have me convinced . 
  but only because of that blue and white swedish flag . 
  unexpected stormaktstiden . 
  it 's like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hugigf-ichm&amp;ab_channel=sinisterminister ) , only with brexit instead of bankrupcy . 
  [ you can even buy your strawberries from a strawberry ] ( http://www.storfjordnytt.no/nyhende08/001bilder/29_jordbar.jpg ), 
  i think `` seppuku '' is the more correct term , but `` harakiri '' is used more in the west ( though also japanese ) maybe because of this movie : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056058/ ? 
  it 's another word for seppuku or japanese ritual suicide . 
  your education is probably in demand , but imagine they would require you to speak the language if you want a job as a psychologist . 
  the only english job ad i could find is a phd position https://m.finn.no/job/fulltime/ad.html?finnkode=90899328, 
  ca n't say it 's the best place i 've visited . 
  got some time off and went to nasa in houston when i was there though , so that was pretty nice . 
  where i live it has literally never been colder than -11 and never been warmer than 27 . 
  -43 c was up north in troms when i was in the army , and we slept outside in tents . 
  +42 was on a business trip to galveston in texas and once in rome on holiday . 
  we 're brothers in arms there , i look like i 've taken a shower when the temp goes above 25c i 've also tried weather from -43 c to +42 c. 
  not sure which was worse . 
  at least you can put on more clothes as it gets colder . 
  commiting hara-kiri because you do n't want to be a bother to anyone .
