  a bit true and pretty sad actually : /, 
  it 's great for the one or two months of the year you can get what little local grown fruit there is . 
  norwegian strawberries are definitely the greatest in the world at least  i promise you you would grow to miss warm weather though . 
  everyone sad kills themselves so there are only happy people left . 
  he 's just really angry at some group that only exists in his head . 
  who knew running a country was actually complicated and difficult ? 
  when tr\u00f8ndelag was part of sweden the border went across the tiny island of [ har\u00f8y ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/har%c3%b8ya ) , putting the two small communities at each end in two different countries . 
  they probably did n't notice . 
  people in norway think they 're so good at english that they do n't have to spend time practicing it . 
  also spanish has passed german as a 3rd language at school . 
  my own fault for flying cheaply with norwegian i guess , 
  to represent the booming flag making industry !, 
  man , sch\u00f6nefeld is one of the worst airports i 've been to . 
  had to wait 45 mins with 200 people in a two meter wide hallway without any seats . 
   m not attempting to absolve my country of wrongdoing . 
  i just do n't like the narrative the the us is an evil imperial power because it 's wrong and is parroted for the sake of being edgy . 
  well i agree with that , although i do think that a fair bit of `` the inevitable america bashing for its own sake '' is legitimate criticism , even if some of it is just edgyness for the sake of pleasing some parts of the electorate . 
  i do think that a lot of european politicians are guilty of using the us kind of like the american right has been using sweden recently . 
  they do n't really care much about the us in earnest , but use a caricatured idea of the us as a contrast to their own country to score political points . 
  in norway we have the expression `` amerikanske tilstander '' ( american conditions ) . 
  it 's not a very positive one and will come up often for example if the election process gets a bit out of hand or when discussing privatization or something similar . 
  you 're right in many ways , and i 'm pretty sure the world would be a more dangerous place without us/nato . 
  other less democratic and liberal countries would be projecting their power . 
  the whole `` evil empire '' thing is absolute bullshit in my eyes , even if there certainly has been a lot of dubious things done in the name of `` freedom and democracy '' , like propping up dictators , using torture etc. 
  that however should n't make the us and nato immune to critisism . 
  and the fact is that we 've handled the middle east terribly since 9/11 . 
  the iraq war was a bad idea that was legitimized through straight up lies by the us government and probably has a lot to do with the rise of isis and lack of stability in the region today . 
  just because it 's less bad than it could be does n't mean things could n't be better . 
  well if we 're being honest , they were and still are . 
  does n't mean that their record is clean or that there is n't a lot of lies and propaganda going on ( wmds in iraq anyone ? 
  ) , but russian politics and media are clearly worse . 
  was going to say that western norway is the same , but a quick look on google maps tells me that there is a lot more deep valleys in norway . 
  just a bit odd at first glance with the rest of britain being so densely populated . 
  why is there almost no-one on the west coast of scotland ? 
  the norwegian equivalent is something like [ this ] ( http://www.hamacareise.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mg_1919.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.smp.no/incoming/article14140929.ece/8t6k7l/alternates/w980-default/26arkstadion3.jpg ) i think . 
  ca n't put houses in a straight line when there is n't a flat surface bigge than 10mx10m in the whole country . 
  well , you are known for keeping a large part of the * ocean * dry . 
  drink the beer and heat the p\u00f8lser and keep everything as jovial as possible . 
  i think contrast like this can look pretty cool . 
  relatively successful in this case i think, 
  yeah people used to dislike the lovely art noveau architecture we have as well . 
  i think a lot of the stuff built in the decades after the war had to be cheap and flimsy to deal with the increase in population and the limited post war economy . 
  luckily i think we can now build some better quality stuff . 
  all these lovers of classic architecture seem to forget the slums that used to exist . 
  those nicely ornamented buildings were for rich people . 
  it 's the working class buildings that have been replaced by the ` commie blocks ', 
  you can find some nice examples from that time as well but i guess a lot was built to be really cheap and easy to mass produce . 
  my sister is an architect and from what i 've heard architects have been getting less and less power in the building process as time has gone on . 
  in these big projects almost every decision is taken for economic reasons and that unsurprisingly yields some ugly stuff . 
  theres lots of nice modern architecture though , and building materials and techniques are very different today so i do n't really see the point of copying past styles externally . 
  it 's just dressing something up to look like something it 's not . 
  quality architecture from most periods looks nice , it 's the cheap half thought out stuff that is bad . 
  mortages are usually reasonable and well regulated though . 
  those payoff plans on the other hand are mostly extortion deals that take advantage of financially illiterate people . 
  looks like a pretty decent piece of architecture to me tbh . 
  ca n't really argue with taste though \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  really ? 
  i have the complete opposite opinion . 
  your picture looks a lot better . 
  the best i can say for the one in my picture is that it 's a bit kitchy . 
  maybe . 
  the facade will probably fall off before that , so i doubt it will get that old ( luckily ), 
  oh yeah , the 80s and 90s produced some [ awful stuff ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/@62.4744454,6.1498941,3a,20.1y,163.42h,102.43t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-n3g64w4sefe%2fv5efbtrrbgi%2faaaaaaaaocm%2ftupca7gbbdmnik08n98yzqamirmzcwybacjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh5.googleusercontent.com%2f-n3g64w4sefe%2fv5efbtrrbgi%2faaaaaaaaocm%2ftupca7gbbdmnik08n98yzqamirmzcwybacjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya107.48446-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i8704!8i4352?hl=no ) here . 
  this is a source of endless debate in my home town . 
  should we copy the [ historic buildings ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=%c3%a5lesund+jugendstil&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1blwb_enno527no527&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjc-oxvjnpsahukhswkhvtpbawq_auibygc&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=726#imgrc=cwr18gvomhxejm: ) , be inspired by them , or just build modern stuff ? 
  both the copies and * especially * the inspired stuff has usually ended up looking like [ ass . 
  ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/@62.4736827,6.1558076,3a,75y,117.14h,106.75t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stnbpcm71mb0zt49tvblgpg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=no ), 
  there is nothing norwegians care more about than what foreigners think about us . 
  small country syndrome . 
  that 's more expensive than in norway . 
  only we have like 3x the income . 
  that said it 's just as common to exercise outside the gym . 
  jogging or skiing etc. 
  personally i play football, 
   yes but the sandwiches are haram , can confirm , once bought a sandwich in [ haram ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/@62.5992102,6.4449765,3a,75y,57.4h,93.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sai3h7oe5v2avu-ffhoml8w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=no ), 
  hydro can do it . 
  as long as you have the capacity . 
  hydro is probably the most flexible power source there is and in many places where they do n't have much of it they use what little they have to handle peaks . 
  saw some short clip about a hydro power plant in the uk during the world cup final . 
  they were waiting for half time so that they could open the gates exactly when people turned their electric tea kettles on . 
  malm\u00f8 is in many ways a nordic `` rust belt '' city . 
  it suffered seriously from the decline of heavy industry in sweden from the 70s onward . 
  i 've lived there briefly , and while it does have some issues for a nordic city it 's not really bad compared to any comparable american or european town i 've been to . 
  there seemed to be a lot of gentrification going on when i lived there and it seems that the city is progressing in a lot of ways . 
  the bridge to k\u00f8benhavn probably helps the work market . 
  eastern european workers mostly i think . 
  if it 's like norway you also have a lot of career criminals coming in from eastern europe to do organized crime . 
  for example 60 % of foreign prisoners in norway are from the eu , the biggest countries are poland , lithuania and romania . 
  they are n't really affected by integration policies as they never actually immigrate . 
  so this group will probably remain fairly steady as long as we have eu/eec and fairly large differences in wealth between east and west . 
  relative poverty in the west beats out war seven days a week though . 
  hell , i 'd rather be poor in peace than rich in a war tbh . 
  most of the immigrants in the nordic countries are work immigrants though . 
  refugees and asylum seekers are another category . 
  for example the top five countries in norway are poland , lithuania sweden , somalia and germany . 
  only somalia is a typical refugee country . 
  i do n't think the argument has ever been that refugees make a country `` better '' , it 's in essence just a humanitarian project . 
  the question you should ask is `` is it worth helping ? '', 
  and/or `` are we really helping ? '', 
  and if so `` are we helping the right people ? '' .
