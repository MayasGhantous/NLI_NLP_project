  there opinions will differ , i wo n't get into that argument . 
  the fact that a lot of them end up unemployed is sad , but it 's not really an argument against the humanitarian side of things . 
  immigration outside of that is more directly a question of it 's good for the economy and people ( and ideologically if you are generally for free movement for people ) , i guess that is still an open question . 
  work immigration seems like it would be good for the economy as long as the economy is already in a good state , kind of depends on if you are the one getting cheap/better labor or if you are the ones with more competition in your labor market . 
  i 've seen some lynx in norway . 
  not exactly huge , but beautiful animals . 
  i 'd be very surprised if that was the case in norway , but then again labor is super expensive here and i think cobblestone is a lot more labor intensive . 
  guessed that . 
  in my dialect i would have said : `` e riv dokke i bita '' , so its pretty close . 
  is n't cobblestone more expensive than asphalt ? 
  it is usually reserved for historic town centers in western europe . 
  [ like this ] ( https://www.google.no/maps/@62.4725234,6.1559664,3a,75y,54.94h,69.27t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqfka07s-jjlxkfixiu9eoa!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dqfka07s-jjlxkfixiu9eoa%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d358.50336%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=no ), 
  yeah i noticed that :d the vikings in for honor also seem to be speaking icelandic : i 've heard `` eg riv ykkur i bitar '' or something like that, 
  i think it 's fairly neutral ( at least in the serious outlets like aftenposten and nrk ) . 
  there is some natural variation . 
  the economics news are full of economists and leans slightly right . 
  the political news are written by people with pol . 
  sci . 
  degrees and lean slightly left . 
  you have some outlets that do n't really make any claim to political neutrality , like klassekampen , but there in most media there seems to be a lot of room for outside commentary . 
  even to the point where i think a lot of low quality stuff gets printed for the sake of it being in opposition to main stream politics . 
  the two big dailies ( vg and dagbladet ) are tabloid populists and all over the place , particularly dagbladet has really gone down the drain . 
  bok = bokm\u00e5l ( `` book language '' ) - danish based norwegian written form nn = nynorsk ( new norwegian ) - dialect based norwegian written form, 
  the issue there is that old norwegian is n't that close to modern norwegian i guess . 
  it should be fairly easy to learn for a norwegian , especially if you 're from western norway , but no-one just understands it without any training . 
  icelanders also learn norwegian pretty quickly if they move . 
  it 's different enough that you need to `` learn '' it to understand it , unlike swedish and danish . 
  heime in my dialect means `` home '' , so words like that get kind of confusing  i ignore a lot of the smaller words like `` a\u00f0 '' , '' \u00fea\u00f0 '' , '' \u00e1 '' and `` s\u00fa '' too . 
  the grammar is generally a lot more complicated in icelandic than in norwegian , which i think is a big part of why it 's so difficult . 
  the order of the words is different for example . 
  i 've got some icelandic family and i can kind of understand what they 're writing sometimes , but spoken it 's more or less impossible . 
  lots of words that i can only understand because of context . 
  for example heimi -  `` the world '' bil -  `` about/circa '' h\u00f6fu\u00f0borg -  capitol ( though i could maybe guess that `` hovedborg '' -  main castle -  capitol ), 
  it would definitely be possible to communicate , probably would n't flow very well a lot of the time though . 
  i 'm guessing you 've been watching `` broen '' ? 
  i would also say that people from that region are a bit more used to danish than the average swede . 
  kind of depends on how used to it they are . 
  there are a lot of common words that are different , and you kind of need to just know them or be really good at understanding context for it to work . 
  yeah , i should have said extended oslo region instead of east maybe ( good luck to any dane trying to decipher [ skj\u00e5k dialect ] ( https://www.nrk.no/video/ps*3903 ) for example ) . 
  and i guess much of that is exposure rather than actual similarities in pronunciation , there i would guess southern norwegian is actually closer . 
  my experience is that danish people will understand eastern norwegian pretty ok , but they struggle with any other dialects . 
  tbh i think you would struggle with most norwegian dialects except the ones from around oslo . 
  that is my experience at least . 
  yes , we have two versions of written norwegian , bokm\u00e5l which is based on danish from the union time and is used by ~ 80 % of the population and nynorsk which is based on norwegian dialects . 
  there is no official version of spoken norwegian , and people will mostly speak their dialects in any setting , from the locker room to the parliament . 
  these dialects can differ quite a bit , though in the later decades we 've gotten a more uniform vocabulary . 
  if you are exposed to it a bit norwegian and swedish are close enough that they could be different dialects of the same language . 
  there are lots of swedes working in norway and they usually speak swedish with a few norwegian words thrown in . 
  danish is a bit more difficult because their pronunciation is very different . 
  i lived in denmark for a while and had to completely drop my dialect and sometimes even speak english to be understood . 
  written danish on the other hand is very close to one of the written forms of norwegian . 
  that is because during our union with denmark danish was the official written language , and ( bokm\u00e5l ) norwegian is based on that . 
  actually median income in the us is quite high : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income so in monetary terms the middle class is well off in the us . 
  you could of course discuss lifestyle and stuff like that , but they do have a high material living standard . 
  the poor are definitely poorer , anecdotally you see it very clearly when travelling there , but the middle class is pretty much on par with western europe . 
  ( and the rich are richer of course ) . 
  who knows , maybe our kids will live to see it ? 
  quite an incredible thought . 
  a bit discouraging that we 've had the 40 hour work week for 40 years now . 
  as someone working in automation i guess i will be among the last to leave work though : /, 
  extrapolating from norway i would say it 's taxed a bit less than income . 
  typically 25 % versus 35 % - ish on income . 
  so in total your tax burden is probably higher in sweden , but then again it includes healthcare , education and a proper social safety net which is replaced partially by private insurance in the us . 
  i 'd still say that in purely economic and material terms a typical middle class person might be slightly `` better off '' in the us , but a working class person is most definitely better off in scandinavia . 
  ( based on unreliable anecdotal experience by me ), 
  sorry about that . 
  it 's true for scandinavia at least . 
  180 hours a year is pretty significant ( over 4 weeks ), 
  it 's a bit hard to compare anyway . 
  if you are an engineer you would probably make more in the us , if you are a bus driver you would probably make less . 
  plus they work more than we do in europe . 
  only 2 million more than norway with four times the population . 
  it 's pretty well established that the us health care system is very inefficient : https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/u-s-health-care-system-ranks-as-one-of-the-least-efficient, 
  looks like the two sadest places on earth : [ murmansk ] ( http://www.normer.uio.no/blog/a-visit-to-murmansk/dsc_2445.jpg ) [ norilsk ] ( http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ydmzthjgjbk/u6uitppnzpi/aaaaaaaazs4/t8dije41pnm/norilsk-11%25255b2%25255d.jpg?imgmax=800 ) crazy that there are so many people living there . 
  not to be nitpicky , but i think troms\u00f8 is the 9th largest munincipality and the town itself is in 16th place . 
  yeah , it 's kind of the nature of that industry though . 
  you ca n't exactly have a factory line that spits out huge $ 300m ships ( with the exception of some shipyards in korea maybe ) , it 's more akin to building a bridge or a large building . 
  a lot of the stuff that goes into it is one-offs and special solutions for just that ship . 
  it does make local news here as well , even fishing boats . 
  though mostly not national . 
  never seen it on anything other than leisure boats . 
  it 's usually rolls royce , caterpillar ( pon cat ) , w\u00e4rtsila and some others . 
  yeah , you meet a lot of finns and finnish companies in the maritime industry . 
  lots of hulls and big engines . 
  never met any swedes actually . 
  war is peace . 
  freedom is slavery . 
  etc, 
   and a little warmer , in the southern bits at least . 
  not really in winter compared to the western norway , but summers is a lot nicer . 
  well i actually lived there for a few months too , 
  yes , i not an expert on sweden , but norway should be comparable and crime has been going down consistently for years . 
  it 's safer than ever . 
  it 's pretty ridiculous when you consider the murder rate in the us is more than four times higher than in sweden . 
   the police do not use the term ` no-go zones , ' but gudmundson argued it was a good way to describe a place where , quoting the report , `` the public in several instances feel that it is the criminals who run the areas '' and where `` police can not carry out their job . '', 
  gudmundsson is just a news reporter . 
  the police have n't said that . 
  if you want some perspective : much maligned malm\u00f6 had a murder rate in 2016 that was 75 % of latvias . 
  crime is low in scandinavia . 
   if police does n't want to patrol or provide security i did n't the article just state the exact opposite ?
