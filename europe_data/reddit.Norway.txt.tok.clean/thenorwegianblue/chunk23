  that they put extra priority on these areas ? 
  i highly doubt anything like this exists in real world sweden . 
  it certainly does n't in norway . 
  personally i think the `` messiness '' comes more from the fact that it is so hard to do proper experiments in social sciences ( without getting really unethical ) . 
  so it 's harder to establish solid theories than in the natural sciences . 
  i also think that some academics are sometimes guilty of obfuscating knowledge with complicated language ( either consciously or uncosciously ) . 
  however that is n't unique to social sciences . 
  i do know that there have been cases where the banking sector has purposely used confusing language in order to hide what products or services you are * actually * buying from them . 
  if i understand [ ops comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ueg79/trade_balance_in_the_eu_countries_in_2016/ddtg1tk/ ) correctly it includes services , but not capital gains . 
  however the uk seems to have negative numbers on that anyway , though i ca n't really understand how or why . 
  it 's like when you grow up and find out all the adults were really just winging it all along . 
  i feel that goes double for economics . 
  surprised to see the uk , switzerland and us in the negative there , especially considering our wealth fund is the biggest stock owner in europe . 
  then again i do n't really understand economics \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  does it also include capital gains ? 
  ( if that is the right term ), 
  are n't they making a lot of money managing other peoples money ( in the financial sector ) ? 
  wonder if that is included in this stat . 
  they look really nice . 
  almost sad no-one uses cash anymore . 
  also nice to see the ulstein x-bow on there as someone who works for ulstein . 
  probably not in europe . 
  even in some very serious cases we could shift production from meat and dairy over to less water intensive foods . 
  not a sure thing , but northern europe for example is predicted to get more rain . 
  i do worry that it could further destabilize the middle east and countries close to the sahara . 
  ( if it can get any worse ), 
  unless we have a world war ( squints westward ) or a massive breakout of disease . 
  hopefully we should be able to avoid both . 
  yeah , it started very high in sub-saharan africa , but there is a general decline in that region too . 
  ( ~ 40 % since the 60s according to a bit of googling ) . 
  stats suggest that the worlds population will plateau in the course of the next century . 
  there are four countries there with high rates that are declining very slowly ( burundi , chad , mali , niger ) , but the general trend is decline . 
  and you also have to consider that child mortality is tragically high in some of those countries .

  i 'd give him about 18 kroner for it . 
  raising children costs a lot of money so you will lose money anyway compared to staying childless . 
  most western states gives some tax benefits and/or subsidies to people with kids already , it 's not really controversial . 
  birth rates are decreasing all over the world though . 
  i think we have a decent solution with good parental leaves and heavily subsidized child care . 
  having near equal parental leave rights for fathers and mothers is a plus too , since women can get pregnant and not feel they are losing ground in their professional lives . 
  also we are going towards shorter work hours instead of longer ones . 
  our birthrate is still a little on the low side maybe , but it would probably increase if you put even more money in the system . 
  we would be surprisingly high up that list with 64 000 in / r/norge, 
  at least a married gay woman that i know of : https://www.nrk.no/norge/lesbisk-prest_-_-hatet-har-gjort-noko-med-meg-1.12494789 theres been gay priests for a while , i 'm sure more of them are married ( though until recently they would have been married outside the church ), 
  we 've got married gay priests here in norway . 
  it has really been quite normalized . 
  some opposition from some conservatives , but none of it in main stream politics . 
  i think rural norway has a younger population than rural sweden ( though i ca n't give you any numbers ) . 
  we 've had less urbanization policies than you guys , quite the opposite in fact . 
  even in a country like norway there are differences . 
  for example the salaries in oslo are generally higher than in a town of 50 000 - 100 000 people . 
  ( though the cost of living is too ), 
  yep , and the further you are from other people the more it is expected . 
  weirdly it 's not acceptable in the city , but if you are in the forest or mountains it 's expected . 
  people live very spread out in norway and parts of sweden and finland so i do n't think climate is much of a factor, 
  i 'm guessing they may have adapted to a local language more . 
  probably not as dominant in numbers as the tatars . 
  conversely there 's a ton of norse origin words in english left from the vikings : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_english_words_of_old_norse_origin even words as common as `` they '' and `` take '', 
  haha , did n't catch that , sorry for being a besserwissing foreigner  yeah , and there is some interesting parallel to how the english has a lot of french words . 
  the language of a small ruling class affecting the greater population . 
  they were n't so much raided as ruled for a very long time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_rus'#age_of_tatar_rule some historians attribute the despotic ruling style of russia to this period . 
  yep temperature in yellowknife right now = -15 c temperature in \u00c5lesund right now = +12 c ( although yellowknife is inland so i guess the comparison is n't that good ) . 
  i guess anchorage is better , and it only has -1 c currently, 
  you see a good deal of eastern europeans that plan to leave , but end up staying when they get kids . 
  particularly the paternal leave is great compared to a lot of places ( which in turn makes it easier for women at work since becoming a parent affects both sexes somewhat similarly in terms of missed work time ), 
  reporting based on race would be a bit controversial , for some very good historical reasons . 
  our statistical census bearue does however report it to a certain extent ( immigrants and region of origin rather than race / ethnicity ) [ pdf in norwegian ] ( http://www.ssb.no/befolkning/artikler-og-publikasjoner/_attachment/159524?_ts=143d903c2f8 ) in general immigrant women have a fertility of ~ ~ 0,07 ~ ~ 0,3 higher than non-immigrants ( 2,1 vs 1,8 ) . 
  the trend is that it gets closer to the national birth rate the longer the group they belong to has `` been in the country '' . 
  the birthrate for women who are `` 2nd generation immigrants '' is 1,94 here is a graph for it : http://imgur.com/iuzv7qo edit : the 0,07 number was the immigrant women compared to the average rather than non-immigrant women . 
  one of the main issues is that the rate of pensioners to young people goes up ( like in japan ) and young people have to work more to finance retired people . 
  other than that i doubt it would be a huge issue . 
  you could always turn up the benefits for parents at some point to turn the trend around . 
  their rates are decreasing though . 
  [ ref hans rosling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lyzboho5ei ), 
  france has fairly good benefits for parents afaik . 
  same with us nordics . 
  not sure how much it actually affects this , but abortion is illegal in ireland . 
  some of eastern europes problem is probably that so many young people emigrate as well . 
  in norway everyone pays with card so there is no rounding anymore . 
  we also removed the 0,50 kr ( 50 \u00d8re ) coin a few years back . 
  nearly all the top twitterers ( tweeters ? ), 
  seem to be in the 40 % -50 % fake range though . 
  we 've got the leader of an ngo no-one has ever heard of as our top guy . 
  kids and teens do n't really use twitter in norway . 
  it 's mostly age 30-ish people discussing sports , politics and norwegian entertainment . 
  it 's far far behind facebook and instagram , but it 's reasonably popular ( about 1 000 000 users ) . 
  particularly for sport and politics . 
  [ jens stoltenberg is the most followed * by * norwegians ] ( http://tvitre.no/norsktoppen ), 
  til about our most popular guy . 
  he probably is n't the most followed by norwegians , mostly international followers . 
  runs an ngo former pm and now nato leader jens stoltenberg is the most followed by norwegians . 
  then 2nd is a parody account for our king, 
  norway will probably slow down a bit with the downturn in the oil sector . 
  at least everything outside oslo . 
  history repeating itself basically . 
  and norwegian tsjekkia, 
  that is [ pretty accurate ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/?show=45479 ) czechia  goes from about stockholm to oslo east to west . 
  out of curiosity , who typically immigrates to lithuania ? 
  i 've met quite a few lithuanians in norway , would have assumed it was an `` emigration-heavy '' country .
