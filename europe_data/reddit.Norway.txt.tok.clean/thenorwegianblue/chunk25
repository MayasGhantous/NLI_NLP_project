  thank you norwegian ( and your cheap foreign labor ), 
  however people in norway have very similar standards of living to each other . 
  people sit around with a big house , a cabin , a boat , two annual holidays abroad , and two cars and still complain that everything is expensive . 
  and people can have all of that almost no matter what job they have as long as they do n't fuck around with their money . 
  in addition we have never spent a smaller percentage on our income on food , and people complain that food is expensive compared to other countries . 
  it is in absolute terms of course , but relative to income it is dirt cheap . 
  statistics for norway : 100 % of asked households have a cat . 
  source : has a cat . 
  next they 'll be accusing ( ( ( someone ) ) ) of poisoning the wells and kidnapping and eating children as well . 
  maybe that is what they mean with `` cultural marxism '' ? 
  is n't it fairly typical for young voters to have more extreme opionions ? 
  both to the left and right . 
  man , i 'm pretty open to differing political opinions , but that sub seems pretty much retarded . 
  i mean , jewish conspiracies ? 
  what year are they living in ? 
   similarly , norway does not mean `` northern way '' but `` north-land '' . 
  the most commonly accepted etymology for `` norge/noreg '' is indeed `` northern way '' or `` way north '' ( nor\u00f0vegr ), 
  norway `` northern way '' we 're simple people us nordics . 
  dishes made with dried fish can be quite tasty if done right . 
  we eat it even though most norwegians could pretty much fish from their own front garden . 
  very few italians here i guess , and the town is only about 60 000 people and already has a lot of restaurants . 
  and tbh i can get some pretty good pizza and pasta at a couple of restaurants , but they are more generally continental than purely italian . 
  still , i think a proper place could work out . 
  my brother in law is half italian and works as a butcher here . 
  he is considering opening up a restaurant . 
  hopefully something will come of it . 
  there 's also two italian restaurants . . run by turkish people, 
  yeah , i prefer bacalao to be honest , but my dad always makes me try the lutfisk every christmas . 
  still disgusting after 30 years . 
  we actually have a restaurant in my home town that serves exclusively portugese style bacalao , it 's quite popular in some parts of norway . 
  that 's preposterous !, 
  now excuse me while i go soak some dried and salted fish in lye to make it gelatinous . 
  the context of the article is actually a discussion on brexit and gb having the poorest regions in western europe, 
  yeah , i guess that is a weakness with this statistic since a lot of companies will have their head office registered in the capital . 
  it 's the same for norway . 
  from [ this article ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/verden/de-bor-i-vest-europas-aller-fattigste-region-na-har-politikerne-begynt-a-hore-pa-deres-viktigste-krav-606208b.html ) in the norwegian newspaper aftenposten . 
  the vertical lines are the countries average . 
  in the article you can hover over to see the name of each region . 
  norways asterix indicate that the average counts off shore oil and gas , but it is n't counted into any of the regions directly . 
  great britain has both the highest and the lowest with inner london and west wales & the valleys respectively . 
  also adjusted for price differences in areas . 
  three norwegians talking :  1 : e e i \u00c5 . 
   2 : \u00c6 e i \u00c5 \u00e6 \u00e5  3 : i \u00e5 e i \u00c5  1 : \u00c5 ? 
  looks about like my great grand parents lived in the 20s and 30s in rural norway . 
  this life style was pretty much gone in the 50s and 60s here . 
  interesting that it still exists somewhere . 
  yeah , the nordics drink the most coffee in the world and we come out of this pretty well tobacco and alcohol on the other hand . 
  both murmansk and trondheim are larger afaik . 
  murmansk would be the saddest capitol in the world though . 
  apparantly i am the 1 %, 
  the same boring cheese every norwegian eats : [ norvegia ] ( http://img.gfx.no/1988/1988476/tine%20norvegia%20m%20hovel%20farge%5b1%5d.956x538.jpg ) it 's a gouda of sorts i think . 
  having seven children is a leftover from when a lot more children died in infancy , people had that many children because very few were left over . 
  there has been a lag between improving health and the number of children people have , but it is going down year by year . 
  [ birth rates are falling everywhere except for two or three countries ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in?year_low_desc=true ), 
  some regions and countries are struggling with conflict and hunger , but it is n't necessarily a trend for the whole continent . 
  the same goes for [ unemployment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate#/media/file:unemployment_rate_map_of_the_world_ ( ilo ) . svg ) . 
  you can even say that africa has a huge potential for improving their food output and food safety . 
  today we 're already producing enough food to feed our whole population despite people going hungry : http://www.worldhunger.org/2015-world-hunger-and-poverty-facts-and-statistics/ http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4525e/y4525e04.htm in fact some are claiming we already produce enough food to feed 10 billion people : https://foodfirst.org/publication/we-already-grow-enough-food-for-10-billion-people-and-still-cant-end-hunger/ meat also uses 4-5 times more water to produce than plants : https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste and we are wasting a huge amount of the food we produce . 
  we can run out of some precious metals and fossil fuels , these need to be replaced somehow . 
  if you find a good source of energy it will solve most of our future worries . 
  food and water we can definitely produce enough of with some adjustments . 
  farming is already incredibly efficient and with some shift in global diets ( eating less meat for example ) it can definitely produce more . 
  what resources ? 
  at some point we 'll run out of oil , you need to replace that with something , hopefully before we are too far gone in global warming . 
  if we find a sustainable source of energy this population doubling wont effect us much . 
  we could even handle it using fossil fuels ( there is a ton of coal around ) if we did n't have to worry about co ^ 2, 
  there are a number of crazy people here that adhere to certain ideologies in this subreddit . 
  population growth is slowing and it will stop at some point . 
  we can definitely produce enough food . 
  population growth is slowing down everywhere : http://www.gapminder.org/videos/what-stops-population-growth/, 
  pollution sure , and everyone probably ca n't drive suvs and have huge tvs , but we can certainly produce enough food with a few adjustments . 
  average ( or median ) salary adjusted for living costs would probably give a decent picture . 
  i 'm in the norwegian military reserves and i 'm definitely a negative asset . 
  that light green part of norway is a very rural area with mostly farming and wilderness , so i would n't necessarily say it 's wrong . 
  we definitely have a long way to go , though i think we 're better off than the gulf states by quite a bit . 
  i work in ship building in norway , and the market basically crashed three years ago , to the point that almost no oil service/supply vessels are built anymore . 
  we 've been slowly turning around and have started getting contracts in cruise , passenger transport , offshore wind service etc. 
  my impression is that this is happening a lot of places in the marine sector . 
  i 'm thinking like the nordic countries think . 
  there is an optimal tax rate for companies . 
  it 's not 0 % and it 's not 100 % . 
  sure , a tax decrease * could * lead to more jobs . 
  it could also lead to more robots or just more money in the pockets of the wealthy . 
  spending the tax income also leads to more jobs , since it gets used for either infrastructure or services . 
  the optimal tax rates are where its high enough that you can provide good services ( a level which is hard to define ) , good infrastructure ( that is used by companies to make money ) , good security , and at the same time low enough that there is an incentive to invest . 
  just blanko lowering taxes to attract international branches ruins the system and creates a race to the bottom . 
  it 's not about low or high tax levels , but rather the right tax level . 
   who 'd knew that lowering taxes for big companies would result in a better economy and a higher standard of living for everyone ? 
  if every country lowered their taxes then you 'd end up with not companies moving and instead just the rich getting richer . 
  being a tax-haven only works if there are just a few tax havens . 
  lots , but since the unions set pay in bigger businesses they sort of set the pay floor in general . 
  smaller businesses will have to pay similar wages as businesses with unions or else they lose their employees . 
  2-3 man operations would often be co-owners though . 
  we could be like a tax haven , only with dark bread and drip coffee instead of high level money theft .

  great and depressing movie . 
  russia ( and the other post soviet states for that matter ) are really interesting and a place we western europeans do n't learn and know enough about imo . 
  just finished a book called [ sovjetistan ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24568113-sovjetistan ) about the central asian ex-soviet countries . 
  fascinating read . 
  the level of corruption and institutionalized crime seems staggering .
