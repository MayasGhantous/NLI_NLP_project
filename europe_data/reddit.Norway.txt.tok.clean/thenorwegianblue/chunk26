  the synthetic pear flavor bears no resemblance to real pears , but it 's worth a taste . 
  i think they mostly chose to call it pear because the soda is green . 
  b r u s a n a n a s s m a k, 
  same in japan . 
  synthetic grape flavor everywhere . 
  just tasted weird to me . 
  a local company here also make pretty popular `` pear '' and [ `` pineapple '' ] ( https://www.google.no/search?q=ananasbrus&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1blwb_enno527no527&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjqipc7nanvahupllakhqwtbhmq_auicygc&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=726 ) flavored sodas . 
  they taste nothing like pear or pineapple . 
  norsko sounds like a brand of work shoes . 
  ( sko = shoe ), 
  fairly common for breakfast and lunch in norway . 
  not common for dinner except for some select dishes . 
  most work cafeterias will have milk dispensers . 
  their road deaths per capita is more than twice ours , so it 's probably somewhat sensible . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate though they also probably drive more . 
  ( and have worse driver education ), 
  my home town . 
  usually tons of tourists in the ` center ' , but go on a small hike and you can be alone for days . 
  it really is the best fjord . 
  huge volumes going on big ships and i think there are also some state subsidies involved . 
  i work in a company that builds stuff both in ee and china and transport to and from china is probably cheaper in a lot of cases , at least as long as it is n't super time critical . 
  you also have the synergy effect of everyone building stuff in china . 
  you can source parts locally and all the competing manufacturers are present there , which is n't necessarily the case in poland or romania . 
  the main issue i 've noticed with china is language . 
  it can be surprisingly hard to find someone who can communicate efficiently in english . 
  being a carpenter , bricklayer etc used to be a well paid job in norway . 
  not so much anymore . 
  `` trickle down '' is derogatory , i do n't think `` reaganomics '' are ( the american right loves reagen afaik ) . 
  and it 's certainly supported by a lot of rich people for some reason . 
  i have never found that to be the case in any city i 've used it in . 
  not if you take quality of the room into consideration . 
  the dams are high in the mountains and are n't usually manned . 
  the stations are closer to sea level and also built up areas . 
  people live very spread out in norway so there are small towns and villages all around the country . 
  you ca n't miss something you 've never known . 
  dark blue boys unite !, 
  ( and cry ), 
  it 's also a lot more expensive than smaller cities in norway . 
  though small cities in norway are n't the most exiting places . 
  you can still get a well paying job though . 
  it 's actually a bit of a special case , this crossing is between two fairly tall buildings that form a kind of funnel that 's pointed south-west . 
  with the right wind direction it gets a lot windier there than elsewhere in town . 
  yup . 
  coastal norway does n't have much variance in temperature . 
  its kind of mild ( for the latitude ) and cloudy all year round . 
  coming from coastal norway the warmest days in dec , jan , feb are usually warmer than the coldest ones in june , july and august . 
  any day of the year can be 11c , overcast , and with light rain . 
  yep , the office is usually half empty on those days . 
  and lets not forget the three or four `` inneklemt dag `` s . the holiest of all days . 
  its a pretty weird statistic in any case . 
  for example norway is mostly mountains , so do you count that or do you count where people actually live ? 
  how would you even calculate these numbers . 
  in fact i just checked and the [ yearly average where i live is 8,75 \u00b0 c ] ( https://www.yr.no/place/norway/m%c3%b8re_og_romsdal/%c3%85lesund/%c3%85lesund/statistics.html ), 
  this is also definitely a thing in china , saw a documentary on it once . 
  the really rich chinese people go to europe and a lot of other people go to substitute locations . 
  i 've been to a few malls in japan with really cliched european/us `` theming '' . 
  and then you have [ stuff like this ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/cities-china-ripped-off-from-the-rest-of-the-world-2015-7?r=us&amp;ir=t&amp;ir=t ) . 
  though it 's made by asians so i guess it 's not europetown in the same way as a chinatown . 
  i for one welcome our fabulous new overlords, 
  the dawn of a new age . 
  the age of the linux desktop . 
  alternatively : have an overflow error . 
  i prefer milliseconds since january 1st 1970, 
  [ currently colder than the warmest temperature in november , december and january ] ( https://www.yr.no/place/norway/m%c3%b8re_og_romsdal/%c3%85lesund/%c3%85lesund/statistics.html ) ... delightful indeed . 
  a delightful 10,5 c outside here too : / [ everything north of oslo and stockholm is cold af ] ( https://www.yr.no/kart/#lat=65.00146&amp;lon=19.54158&amp;zoom=3&amp;laga=temp&amp;proj=3575 ), 
  was in japan recently and they all use those masks against pollen . 
  supposedly shuts out 90 % . 
  downside is you look like a moron . 
  yeah , i work in the ship building industry and there has been a huge change of focus . 
  we 've gone from 90 % oil and gas to the opposite in just a couple of years . 
  it 's not so much that as knowing that there is a change coming and being ready for it . 
  in addition to our somewhat hypocritical environmental politics . 
  we 've certainly done better than a lot of other countries . 
  killed eight people and if the bomb had n't blasted downwards into the underground parking it would have killed a lot more . 
  it was right outside the prime ministers office , so i assume he was the main target . 
  not that it was n't worse killing all those kids , but it just illustrates that he was willing to kill people without regards to political affiliation . 
  ( though it was an attack on the state and by extension the social democrats that were in power at the time ), 
  he also blew up some government buildings where most of the people are just beaurocrats ( including my gf who was luckily on holiday ) . 
  we 're just getting started . . tbh this is because of how dominant the oil industry is . 
  no-one left to innovate when everyone is working on pumping that black stuff out of the ground ( though we are really really good at doing that ) . 
  all the consumer products and stuff we used to make have been pushed out by oil stealing the most competent workers and also pushing the currency up so much you ca n't export anything else . 
  change is coming though , we basically have no choice . 
  a lovely 9 degrees and rain there [ currently ] ( https://www.yr.no/place/norway/nordland/flakstad/lofoten/ ), 
  having experience -42 \u00b0 to +42 \u00b0 i 'd say +42 is definitely worse . 
  at -42 you can put on clothes and still function outside at least . 
  would n't recommend any of them though . 
  was in galveston in the us for work in july a few years back . 
  42 \u00b0 and 80 % humidity or something crazy like that . 
  then the sea just made it worse . 
  i prefer 16 \u00b0 and slate grey skys here in norway to that tbh . 
  it was like walking in a hot steam shower . 
  named after the world cup in mexico where most europeans saw it first . 
  though we just call it `` b\u00f8lgen '' which directly translates to the wave . 
  i would guess adding mexican to it is mostly a british thing . 
  `` two beers '' would be the meaning in norway . 
  so congrats england , you just bought two norwegian beers , say goodbye to your economy . 
  personally i really like `` boxy '' unornamented modern architecture when done well . 
  a lot of the cheap housing has very little architectural quality though , everything about them is usually done to maximize profit/keep cost down , much like these 60s appartment buildings . 
  cheap materials , poor layouts , poor aesthetics etc. 
  i 'm absolutely not saying we should tear them down .
