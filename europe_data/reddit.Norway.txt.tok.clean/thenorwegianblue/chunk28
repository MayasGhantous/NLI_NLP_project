  so that would pull up the average quite a bit , along with binge drinking . 
  i do believe that it 's more common to commit suicide when under the influence of drugs or alcohol . 
  lowered inhibitions and all . 
  that does n't require getting drunk on a regular basis though , maybe more the opposite . 
   that 's not true though . 
  breivik , who is definitely white , was found to be legally sane , legally sane , though he definitely has some mental issues that would have contributed to ending up as a terrorist . 
  delusions of grandeur , lack of empathy , narcissitic personality etc. 
  so he was to some extent mentally ill , though not psychotic or unaware of what he was doing . 
  still a terrorist in my mind though . 
  to a certain extent he did it for ideological reasons . 
  in high school i had a flatmate whos parents worked at the grandiosa factory . 
  ate so much grandiosa i ca n't even look at one anymore . 
  2 % of our population is polish now , probably more in the biggest cities . 
  we have two polish grocery stores in my little town of about 50 000 people . 
  list of the best pizzas : 1 . 
  taco-pizza 3 . 
  beef - and pineapple-pizza * ducks *, 
  they actually often put salad and pommes frites on top of the pizza after it has come out of the oven , 
  anything that gets crossposted to * those * subreddits gets brigaded to fuck . 
  had a comment the other day where i linked some stats from the eu and it suddenly went from 25 + to 0 in about 30 mins while the obivously made up post it was an answer to went from +1 to +30 in the same time . 
  these people have lost all form of contact with reality . 
  did n't you give us 0 as well ? ^ ^ j\u00e6vlar, 
  i 'm actually not sure if i 've ever had kebab completely sober . 
  ** italian trigger warning ** i 've had kebab pizza though, 
  haha , damn !, 
  who was i thinking of ? 
  and i thought your song was one of the worst he did have some sweet trust falls though . . 
  it 's fucking eurovision for fucks sake . 
  i 'll be in my bunk listening to darkthrone . 
  super boring song . 
  super boring hosts . 
  it was still fun to get drunk and watch . 
  congrats portugal spain was atrocious . 
  borderline warcrime . 
  they could offer safety from war probably , though maybe not very well equipped to handle large amounts of immigrants/refugees . 
  a lot of the countries close by have huge issues , and africa is a huge continent . 
  for example eritrea is surrounded by somalia , sudan , ethiopia , eritrea and is [ closer to europe than southern africa ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/?show=47370 ) . 
  from a personal perspective it 's fairly easy to understand that people want to come to europe . 
  escaping to safety is of course a main priority , but if you were to first choose to escape from your home country would you choose to go somewhere close , to a life of instability and extremely poor living conditions , or would you then go further to a well functioning society that could offer better living conditions and a potential future for your family and children ? 
  ( education , healthcare , job market etc ) . 
  and like the case with syria , there are * a lot * of refugees already in close by countries , so much so that they are already overburdened . 
  ( except for the rich arab countries , though that is another debate all together ) . 
  it 's a complicated question for sure , and there 's no easy answer . 
  the best for everyone would of course be stability in these regions , but as long as there is not there will be refugees , and they will go * somewhere * . 
  it all ends up as a mix of feelings , morality and politics , and people will always have different opinions on how much help and what kind of help it is morally right to give . 
  i think most places these days will offer a `` quality '' beer in addition to standards like hansa , ringnes , dahls , aas , frydenlund , carlsberg etc. 
  you 'll find a large selection of norwegian microbrews in a lot of pubs , i do n't live in oslo , so i do n't really know the best places there ( seem to remember crowbar being decent ) . 
  of the `` big '' microbrews ( hehe ) i 'd suggest n\u00f8gne \u00d8 , haandbryggeriet , kinn , lervig and austmann . 
  if you travel around norway a bit ( i would at least suggest seeing the proper fjords in the west ) you 'll find lots of smaller local ones . 
  a personal favourite of mine is geiranger bryggeri , though that might be mostly because i know the guys behind it . 
  prepare to spend a lot of money though , 
  we have some fantastic micro breweries tbh . 
  mainstream standard lager is as bad/good as anywhere else . 
  yeah , i think if you adjust this list for average wage or ppp or something similar oslo would n't look as bad . 
  and the normal price in normal pubs is probably more like $ 8.5, 
  we do have a ton of great microbreweries in norway . 
  the prices have probably motivated some home brewing , 
  to be fair to you nigerians are the 5th largest group and i do believe a majority of them have very little chance of getting asylum ( i 'm no expert on the situation in nigeria , i 've just read this ) . 
  so you could argue that they are here for economic reasons i guess . 
  though they would claim to be fleeing from boko haram , so who knows really . 
  the next two african countries on the list are eritrea and somalia , and its not hard to understand that people want to escape from there . 
  eritrea for example has a very oppressive regime and all men are required to go into indefinite military service when they turn 18 . 
  the average span of this is over 6 years and in some cases they have to stay for 15 or more . 
  according to human rights watch they also have the worst human rights situation in the world and the lowest press freedom . 
   it 's a shame the vast majority are not refugees just piss poor africans looking for a better life . 
  the most common groups were [ syrians , iraqis and afghans ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states,_2015_and_2016_%28thousands_of_first_time_applicants%29_yb17.png ) edit : i observe the fact that this comment containing actual statistics was upvoted , and the completely made up one above was downvoted for a while before this article happened to be crossposted on ** 22 ** ( !! ), 
  other subs . 
  hmmmm . 
  you can actually have solar power a lot of places in norway despite the dark winter and cloudy summers . 
  it 's just that we 're already a net exporter of electricity using almost exclusively hydro power . 
  you see more and more solar panels on `` passive '' or `` plus energy '' buildings though . 
   and they 're heavily centralization focused ( so as the tout the `` anti-bureaucracy '' line ) . 
  at the same time as taking any opportunity to appeal to their rural base voters . 
  not unlikely that they will lose some power to sp in the next election because of this . 
  turns out you can be pro-centralization and pro-rural at the same time when you 're in actual power . 
  rather than being guided by a strong belief in ideology they just pick out symbolic policies that will appeal to voters that otherwise would n't care enough to vote . 
  they kind of pick and choose to make themselves electable . 
  if you look at it in a positive light you can say that a lot of these thing are the will of the people and that they 're just being democratic . 
  viewed a bit more negatively some people will say that they are just using popular things to gain power and that they 're either demagogues that have hidden agendas ( or just a lust for power ) or that their politicians are somewhat incompetent and do n't have actual thought through policies beyond the symbolism ( which imo is my opinion of what frp are ) . 
  they 're very inconsistent in promoting both `` freedom '' and conservativism . 
  for example they want to legalize a lot stuff like gambling , lowering taxes on alcohol etc because they think individuals should be `` free to choose for themselves '' , but at the same time they want to make a lot of christian stuff obligatory in school . 
  the reason they are seen as populist are that they claim to be for `` common people '' and use a lot of pretty meaningless symbolic stuff while their actual politics seem to benefit rich people more than working class ones . 
  i guess all political parties have populist elements , and i do n't think there is necessarily anything wrong with it , though i 'm personally not too fond of frp . 
  they 're populists and are really fond of symbolic policies that will get single cause voters to vote for them . 
  last election it was for example seg-ways , licorice pipes , poker , pro boxing and jetskis . 
  other than that they 're conservative in a lot of issues ( gender roles , the church , environment etc ) and liberal in others ( alcohol and tobacco , less taxation and regulation etc ) in addition to that they 've won a lot of votes on being `` car friendly '' and `` anti-immigration '' ( except for of cheap labor of course ) . 
  he 's clearly saying we need a lion on top . 
  we can send him on state visits to people we do n't like . 
  foreign policy will be easy guys !, 
  the populist circle of life : 1 . 
  `` if we just get rid of the elites and rule by ` common sense ' things will be so much better . 
  it will be easy guys ! '', 
  gain power 3 . 
  `` turns out things are actually complicated and difficult . 
  who knew ? '', 
  lose power 5 . 
  return to 1 . 
  working in automation a noticeable high percentage of equipment is from europe compared to consumer electronics . 
  i think that address is different from `` folkeregistrert adresse '' , which is the official one . 
  that one determines where you can vote in local elections etc.
