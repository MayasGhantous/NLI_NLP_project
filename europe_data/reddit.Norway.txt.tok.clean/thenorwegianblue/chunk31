  well , it was a small figure to begin with , so the increase looks worse than it is . 
  in total its still 0,2 % lower than sweden . 
  my impression after living in norway , denmark and sweden is that norwegians are a lot more anglophile than swedes and danes . 
  we have some common history in the viking age , both are seafaring nations and a lot of people developed warm feelings for britain during wwii . 
  also english football and music . 
  think about how difficult it would be . 
  you would have to enforce very strict border control as well as tight surveillance of large portions of the economy , and you would have to do it consitantly over the whole of europe . 
  forging papers is n't really that difficult either . 
  not letting people immigrate legally increases illegal immigration and that in turn increases the illegal economy ( because immigrants cant make money legally and pay taxes ) . 
  not really , you are projecting some sort of conspiracy theory that `` someone '' is activly trying to keep people separated . 
  people move , they are different , then their kids are a bit less different etc etc. 
  thats how things have always worked . 
  theres nothing necessarily wrong with different people living together , it works fine in a lot of places and have throughout history . 
  over time however , there is assimilation and cultural diffusion . 
  this recent flair of `` anti-multiculturalism '' is just your bread and butter reaction to hard economic times . 
  people look for someone to blame , they dont want to blame themselves , so they find someone different . 
  personally i like having people from different cultures and origins around me , and as long people respect the law and other human beings people can be as different from me as they want . 
  no reasonable and realistic person will ever believe that people can exist in some kind of vacuum like a state inside a state . 
  assimilation is just a natural progression of the separate communities . 
  i dont think any country in europe actively tries to segregate cultures , integration and diffusion is always a goal , and even if it was n't it would still happen . 
  ghettofication is a problem , but it comes more down to economic issues ( newcomers will seek out cheaper areas ) . 
  if you treat people as individuals and problems as the problems themselves instead of lumping people together in large groups you can discuss it . 
  lumping whole religions , natonalities and regions together may not be racism , because it is n't necessarily about race , but one is commiting the same error as with racism , which is judging people by some irrelevant surface characteristic and not by their opinions or abilities . 
  ** some ** traits of ** some ** cultures may not be compatible , but people can adapt and one thing being incompatible does n't mean that whole peoples or cultures should be dismissed . 
  when people dismiss `` multiculturalism '' as a whole they are commiting the same error . 
  discussing individual problems with for instance political groups or religions is fine , but lumping people together and saying that a whole culture is incompatible with a whole other culture is just a gross and silly simplification of human beings and society . 
  there are certainly people within my own culture that i do n't get along with , and there are people from outside cultures that i do n't get along with , but i try to refrain from generalizing and projecting bad characteristic of smaller groups or single persons on whole populations . 
  besides , to repeat my earlier point . 
  any country/ethnic group/region will have people of very differing and conflicting opinions and lifestyles no mather what you do , multiculturalism is intrisic because people are different . 
  there is no such thing as a homogunous population . 
  we just deal with it and resolve conflicts wherever viewpoints are incompatible . 
  and when the word `` multiculturalism '' gets used it seems to just be a filler for `` different than me '' , `` foreigners '' , `` people i dont like '' or some such tripe . 
  in practice separating the two are of course a bit difficult . 
  but `` hate speech '' is basically threatening the health , safety and freedom of other people ( groups or individuals ) based on measures that are outside the law or outside democratic tools . 
  for instance : `` i disagree with some principles of islam and christianity , and i think that this or that practice should be made illegal '' is certainly not hate speech . 
  saying `` all religious people are stupid and should n't be allowed to say anything , they are to blame for this and that '' would be rather hateful and condems a whole group of people . 
  i basic we should always be allowed to disagree with opinions and practices , but forcing our ideas on others outside the democratic and humane framework is hateful . 
  of course from a philosophical standpoint the individual can chose his own moral values , but i think these are good guidelines for a modern humane peaceful society . 
  edit : and by discrimination i mean unequal treatment based on arbitrary individual traits that are n't relevant in the situation . 
  edit : maybe i was a bit bland in describing my view of `` hate speech '' . 
  there needs to be some threat of violence or taking away of human rights ( direct or implied ) for it really to be hate . 
  in a democracy only the democracy should be allowed to punish and take away rights . 
  well , you ca n't really prosecute someone for their beliefs , there has to be some action or at least threat of action , such as hurting someone either directly or indirectly . 
  i also believe that blatant `` hate speech '' and discrimination should result in some rights being taken away . 
  knowing the outcome , of course it would be preferable that abb was handled earlier . 
  its a failure of the state that a person as mentally disturbed as he was n't picked up at some point . 
  edit : and to answer your first question : of course it should , and it does as well , if you do something to violate this you are usually put in jail ( i.e. 
  you can no longer participate as a free citizen ) or given some economic punishment . 
  im not saying it would be pointless , it probably just is n't worth spending a lot of resources on . 
  even the most heavily guarded boarders have quite a lot of illegal immigration . 
  as long as there is enough motivation , people will move . 
  sure , we could build some ridiculous dmz-like area between europe and the rest of the world , but it would probably cost less to have a reasonable and humane immigration policy . 
  from an idealistic standpoint i believe that all people should be free to move and live where they want , of course this is n't really practically possible in any realistic sense , but neither is shutting down the borders on an entire continent . 
  something reasonable , humane and moderate is probably the best solution , allowing people to move but not in a way that overexerts the place people move to . 
  there has to be resources enough to receive and integrate newcomers . 
  this is true , failing to follow these principles should result in not being allowed to participate in society . 
  the problem is when people judge people as part of groups instead of as individuals . 
  saying `` all arabs hate free speech and equality for women '' just is n't true , and saying it or implying it ( as many do ) actually is racist ( extending racism to cultures as well ) . 
  i think that most people who immigrate to europe from poorer and `` less modern '' societies do so because they are unhappy with how this is done in their own country , and most will want to adapt . 
  yes , like the us-mexican border or nk to china . 
  people even emigrated from ddr . 
  ... because we accept and tolerate people being different , which they do n't do in saudi arabia ( as much ) . 
  one of the reasons europe is such a good place to live is that we have freedom of speech , politics and religion . 
  [ no irish need apply ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_american#discrimination ) and have you ever had a * hamburg * er or a hot-dog ? 
  yes . 
  but not if its just a codeword for racism or xenophobia . 
  besides , being against `` multiculturalism '' is pretty stupid . 
  all countries in the world are made up of people with different political views , with differing tastes in food , music , art and so on . 
  most if not all have people of different religions or philosophies . 
  people are people essentially , personally i have friends that are born in egypt , iran and russia that i have more in common with than my neighbour of 60 even though we were born in the same town , have the same religion and speak the same language . 
  extremism is of course a problem , but this problem exist in all religions , philosophies and political views . 
  the fact that its so strong in islam today has its very clear recent historical reasons and is n't really something that can be attributed islam as a religion . 
  any religion and religious text can be interpreted by the individual as he or she pleases . 
  whats more important are the core values of modern society : freedom of speech , freedom of religion/philosophy , equality , justice and respect for other humans . 
  as long as everyone agree and adhere to this the surface details of culture ( food , language , rituals etc ) are not very important . 
  immigration and emmigration are almost like the weather , you can complain or be happy , but it will happen regardless . 
  people will always want to move from poorer and less successfull regions to richer ones with a higher standard of living . 
  the only real `` monoculture '' that exists right now is north korea , and that seems to be working out swell for them . 
  it seems that a lot of people are blaming the current economic situation in europe on immigrants , but the notion is completely ridiculous . 
  our current problems stem from an economic bubble created by poor state politics and irresponsible banks and companies going for easy profits by cheating the system . 
  well , as i said . 
  taxes . 
  $ 500 will cover about the rent of a small room where you share a kitchen and bathroom with others . 
  though maybe not in oslo , where things are a bit more expensive . 
  no , unless you fail courses . 
  there is also a loan available for about $ 500 a month , but its voulentary and does n't run interest until you get your first proper job . 
  of course one could argue that we pay it back through higher taxes . 
  my understanding is that the danes get about twice as much , and they get it twelve months a year , compared to 10 for us . 
  :d nope . 
  though you have to remember that we do pay it through much higher taxes , but personally i 'm fine with it as it promotes social equality by making education available to anyone . 
  theres a difference between shaving and cutting ones head off . 
  politics and policy will always have to find some middle ground with these things . 
  with our drinking culture i think it makes sense , however there are some good examples of overregulation in norway . 
  for instance professional boxing is banned in norway , but the argument is that its too brutal and barbaric , rather than an economic one . 
  base jumping is allowed to some extent , so it really doesnt make much sense . 
  i always think of it like this : police and health services are publicly funded . 
  consumption of alcohol causes great cost for both . 
  therefor alcohol should be taxed accordingly . 
  it can be a bit annoying when you 're in the store to buy a six-pack , but overall it makes perfect sense . 
  i am very worried that this will create a situation where skilled students can not afford to study , or at least can not afford to dedicate all their time to studying because they need to work during the school year to support themselves .
