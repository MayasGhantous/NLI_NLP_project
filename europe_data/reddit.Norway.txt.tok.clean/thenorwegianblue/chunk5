  i 'll be in the garden burying some salmon, 
  i 'd rather eat that than american chocholate . 
  disgusting stuff . 
  ut\u00f8ya was actually about 1,3 times larger ( in terms of deceaced people ) relative to the population than 9/11 was . 
  however the us had some other terrorist acts in the 90s , so i guess it would rank pretty high . 
  still well above average and 30 points better than us . 
  yes , we begin this descent by moving from 85 to 86 points . 
  chaos and madness next . 
  i know i would . 
  and a shocking 5th least corrupt in the world . 
  we on the other hand , beat sweden , so it was a great success . 
  kidding aside we are just getting terrible results , and while it can be debated i believe it indicates that we have sub par educations . 
  serious reform is needed , both for increasing the quality of our teachers and for improving the methods used in teaching science and math . 
  we need to look at what comparable countries like finland , the netherlands , switzerland and estonia are doing better than us . 
  you had us at seal hunt < 3, 
  double consonants in norwegian tell you how long the preceding vowel should be pronounced . 
  `` stop '' would be pronounced `` stoop '' , `` stopp '' is with a short o. 
  the more you know . 
  do you want to stop saying r correctly ? 
  do you want your football team to stop winning ? 
  do you want to stand in the rain and play drums as a past time activity ? 
  ... omg the second one has allready happened !, 
  i have the same jacket as that guy with sunglasses , not sure how i feel about that . 
  i also thoroughly enjoy the guy with the bag from netto smoking a cigarette . 
  edit : here is some nice satire : [ stopp islandiseringen av norge ] ( http://morgenbladet.no/ideer/2011/drom_fra_sagaland ), 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rws12/next_year_the_eu_will_allow_29_million_bulgarians/cdrq39b first page . 
  i 'm at work , so the last 3 or 4 pages i will leave untranslated . 
  here goes :  ** why is the islamisation of norway unwanted ? 
  **  islam is about to invade/occupy/enter into norway . 
  must we now follow jonas gahr st\u00f8res ( former minister ) imposition on us to `` adapt '' to `` the new norway '' and `` the new we '' . 
  do you want that ? 
  have you been asked ? 
  < picture of the national assembly   do you want to keep our democracy and freedom ? 
  . . . . . .  do you want to submit to a totalitarian political-religious - forced upons by a warlord and `` prophet '' from the 5th century ? 
  then there were about 3 or 4 pages of absolute incoherent drivel , with a lot of things in quotes . 
  yes , i got that it was satire . 
  the one i got was definitely not , though it was stupid enough and poorly written enough to be pretty close . 
  stopp islamiseringen av norge ( sian ) and theres more : http://imgur.com/a/t0hyj#ocjp5 they happen to have a few guys living here in \u00c5lesund , so i got a few of these . 
  haha . 
  got a similar one in the mail once , it was quite super serial : http://i.imgur.com/pf3ve.jpg in norwegian , but you get the gist i think . 
  true enough . 
  my point was that the job market is all right for engineers in sweden , also from a norwegian perspective . 
  a lot of things are more important than money , as long as you have enough money to live a decent life , 
  48 000 is actually pretty close to the average in norway ( at least if you include cost of living ) . 
  as far as i 've heard from friends and coulleages the situation is pretty similar in terms of jobs . 
  engineers and other highly trained professionals actually have quite low salaries ( compared to the rest of the population ) compared to countries that are less egalitarian . 
  if so oslo should be there , maybe , depends on how you define it : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_oslo_region, 
  bereaving those lovely birds of their natural enviroment , no wonder they 're pining for the fjords . 
  in my experience , ay . 
  and 90 % scots . 
  close to 12 000 in norway is well , if wikipedia is to be trusted . 
  i think the general consensus is that even before oil we were on our way to being a rich nordic country on par with denmark ( or maybe slightly below ) , but instead we ended up being wealthier than the other nordic countries . 
  so we went from rich to filthy rich ( but still pretty sensible ) . 
  yeah the audience even gets points on occation . 
  i would just like to use this opportunity to thank the uk for the best tv program ever . 
  i can vividely remember seeing a banana palm in greece when i was there on holiday when i was about 12 . 
  so there are some at least . 
  yes , have seen this one a few times in norway as well . 
  personally , as an office rat i 'm somewhat partial to [ lunch ] ( http://www.lunchstriper.no/ ), 
  as usual sweden has one : http://swedishproblems.tumblr.com/ , and norway does n't . 
  the newspaper just admitted that they were probably wrong : http://www.nrk.no/norge/dagbladet-innrommer-misforstaelse-1.11366562 [ translated ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=no&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nrk.no%2fnorge%2fdagbladet-innrommer-misforstaelse-1.11366562&amp;act=url ), 
  from my experience in norway they hire two nurses to work 50 % , so that they 're covered for illness and stuff . 
  then they say there is a lack of nurses , because they want to hire three nurses at 30 % . 
  there is also supposed to be a lack of engineers , but my brother applied to some positions recently and there were over 200 applicants . 
  i think the whole `` lack of professionals '' thing is a bit constructed . 
  it get expensive ** r ** , though calling it ** very ** expensive compared to other countries is a bit off i think . 
  this was just my local price right now . 
  the irresponsible over generous spending , and low taxes , of southern european nations leading up to the crisis ? 
  its more about doing what will get you elected rather than doing what you think is best for the country . 
  i think we pay 35 \u00f8re / kwh ( 0.04 $ / kwh ) + a yearly fee . 
  depends , very few in the smaller towns . 
  and even then i have got the impression from police that the heroin comes in via oslo . 
  every druggie in norway moves to oslo and smugglers have a huge incetive in high prices and lax punishment . 
  men for helve ( de/te ) , man burde begyn ( d/n ) e at / \u00e5 give/gi u ( t/d ) b\u00f8 ( g/k ) er i dette forma ( d/t ) et . 
  correct !, 
  kudos are on their way in the mail . 
  i feel i can sort of understand dutch if i read it carefully and slowly ( same with icelandic to some degree ) . 
  hearing it on the other hand , not a chance . 
  reminds me of this cake from a local bakery : http://www.rbnett.no/incoming/article6794815.ece/alternates/w980-default/978x.jpg, 
  we should petition the eu to get it in nynorsk as well . 
  i will not stand for this shampoo bottle discrimination any longer !, 
  all nations have debt , its sort of used to control the currency . 
  in practice we are owed more money than we owe others , so you could in a sense say that we have no debt . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_external_debt national debt is n't really the same as personal debt , even though they are both called debt . 
  we have lots of debt , all countries have , its part of how the economy works, 
  funny then that the norwegian and danish hole money are so similar you always end up with a wrong one eventually . 
  i even put norwegian money in a parking meter in denmark . 
  you could just send a good song ... who am i kidding , crossdressing midgets on trampolines it is . 
  if that suddenly happened en masse throughout europe we 'd all probably be boned anyway . 
  imo , without it we would be on about the level of finland , slightly poorer than denmark and sweden . 
  though we do have huge maritime and hydroelectric resources , so maybe slightly above finland again . 
  more dense population , i.e. 
  smaller counties . 
  the map does n't really show who 's richest . 
  pyntelisten = `` decorative trim '', 
  now i also want to vote in denmark . 
  i would have voted pyntelisten . 
  i 'm not sure if the money spent is all that relevant . 
  its more relevant how many people use either for their main means of transportation . 
  sales like these would imply it .
