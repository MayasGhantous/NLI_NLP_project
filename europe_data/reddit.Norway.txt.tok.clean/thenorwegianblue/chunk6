  actually the norwegian one was a bigger version of the same thing . 
  turning into ? 
  thats what norway was built on . 
  `` give all food to feed starving ~ ~ russian ~ ~ alien troops '' `` sure , have some lutfisk and smalahove '' '' \u0435\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044c '', 
  we even have a channel called bbc entertainment , basically twenty four seven panel shows and top gear . 
  and eastenders ^ ( oh god why ? ), 
  nothing in them makes sense . 
  yeah you 're right . 
  better ui though , if you ask me . 
  its too bad that they have n't grown to be a market leader , because they 've always been innovators ( css , tabbed browsing , gestures , integrated torrents , etc ) and they never got the success they deserved . 
  i will still use it , mostly out of old habits i guess . 
  opera !, 
  opera !, 
  opera !, 
  seriously , you should try it . 
  the two other are for the unwashed masses . 
  we are the elite privileged few . 
  it was the biggest browser in belarus for a while . 
   as far as my experience from working in oslo and trondheim and those of other `` partysvensker '' i met goes i 'd say you 're in the minority . 
  even among those who i think you 'd find a lot of people who find the idea of the guy in the article being norwegian to be laughable . 
  i would n't call this particular guy norwegian myself either , but my point is that being norwegian is n't about ethnicity , its more about language , personal feelings , and some shared culture . 
  and people do n't need to have an exclusively norwegian identity to be considered norwegian . 
  nationality is a very complex mix of legality , personal feelings , cultural norms , language and lots of other stuff , so its pretty hard to define . 
  ethnicity can play a part for some people , for others it does n't . 
  and no i do n't think i 'm in a minority , its rather that the actual minority that take the opposite standpoint are rather loud about it . 
  personally i 'm from the countryside and even there i 've never felt this oppinion to be a minority oppinion . 
  edit : to put it on the knife point ( as we say ) , who is more norwegian ? 
  : someone who has 100 % norwegian ethnicity and is a 3rd generation immigrant to america , who does n't speak norwegian and knows very little about our country , or someone with two moroccan parents that has grown up in , say , stryn , speaks norwegian perfectly , and has had all of his education and life in norway ? 
  what a silly thing to say , there are lots of non-ethnic norwegians i would refer to as norwegians . 
  you also have to remember that we have had more than one ethnicity in this country for as long as it has existed ( sami , finns etc ), 
  well , he did burn down some churches . 
  you could label that terrorism if you wanted to . 
  it was however not related to neo-nazism . 
  so then you rape it and burn down its cow shed instead . 
  right ? ^ right ? ^ guys ? 
  we kept our old methods : http://i.imgur.com/lolkeqp.png, 
  no , siberia begins east of the urals , i.e. 
  outside europe . 
  however most of the population of russia is west of the urals . 
  ah , it was the ~ ~ white ~ ~ viking mans burden to bring the light of civilization and odin to you heathens . 
  sadly we failed in the end . 
  err . 
  i think the latest asian migration to north america was around 8000 b.c. 
  vikings came to america around 9000 years later . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halld\u00f3r_laxness worth a read . 
  i heard it on spr\u00e5kteigen as well . 
  pretty reliable, 
  75g margarin ( smeltet ) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgwt58wkekw, 
  no no , then i would have sold them a 1000 liters of milk . 
  my parents have a small grocery store in the countryside , we also sell scythes , pots and pans , waffles , sleds , christmas trees , plant soil , fireworks etc etc. 
  worked in a grocery store for years . 
  an old italian lady came in to try to buy something . 
  after failing to understand any language i tried and after a good period of just speaking italian louder and louder she did a half decent chicken imitation and left with a 12-pack of eggs . 
  edit : on a side note , dutch people ca n't say the word eggs in english . 
  i 've tried to sell a man both axe bodyspray and an actual axe before i understood what he wanted . 
  ro d\u00e6 ne no fransois . 
  edit : i 'm finally learning some german !, 
  it used to be german , now its spanish . 
  more fashionable i guess . 
  i however , had german . 
  norwegians get about $ 500 a month as a stipend ( if we pass ) and $ 500 as a loan . 
  foreigners dont get anything ( except some cases with 3rd world countries i think ) . 
  have met lots of dutch people doing their master in norway actually , the cultural differences are small , but the differences in nature and geography are of course huge . 
  well theres already a few farm animals on there , a few more wont make a difference . 
  http://www.netplaces.com/classical-mythology/zeus-and-hera-a-marriage-made-in-heaven/zeuss-love-affairs.htm its already a long and varied list . 
  i guess every country has some technology clusters . 
  none are as extreme as silicon valley though . 
  in norway i would say that trondheim and companies coming from ntnu are up there , and kongsberg has a surprising amount of tech companies . 
  well , the ancient greeks were known for their * erm * platonic love between men . 
  are worse . 
  yep , i 've experienced this on business travels to china as well . 
  ( and with a western degree you are also basically king of any setting ) . 
  however my gf is adopted from sri lanka , so i was kind of seeing it through her eyes at times . 
  i knew there was racism , but i did n't * really know * . 
  unless you are drunk , naked , and sweaty . 
  then it stops existing . 
  thats most of east asia . 
  me and the gf have traveled there and i was treated like some prince while they all assumed she was a maid . 
  eye opener . 
  [ winter olympics are coming ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhjkaocqta1qev59to1_400.gif ), 
  you can only spend it on a home though , if you do n't you have to pay back the tax break . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy a lot of europeans get older than greeks . 
  cold weather does n't seem to be a factor . 
  behind sweden ? 
  we might as well be last . 
  sat on the bench in shorts for a good 80 minutes of a football game last night . 
  we were shit and lost . 
  there were mosquitoes ... 
  in late september, 
  in short : not really . 
  maybe if some of the more extreme forces in frp could decide , but their hands are pretty much tied as the minority party in a minority coalition . 
  they can target all they want but it will be hard to get anything extreme through . 
  14c and sun in norway . 
  just so you know . 
  edit : 15.8 c http://i.imgur.com/vhaiyma.png . what is happening ? 
  ay , one step would be to sort out more student housing . 
  it would alleviate some of the pressure . 
  yes in general , but we have what you might call a housing bubble as well . 
  young people ( under 33 ) have been getting tax breaks for years for saving towards purchasing a home ( bsu ) . 
  you get a bank account with very good interest and you can get 20 % of what you save back in taxes .
