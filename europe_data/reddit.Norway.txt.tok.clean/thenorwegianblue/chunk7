  so its not really revolutionary . 
  imo the high personal debt in norway is because of a lack of housing has driven up property prices . 
  companies stopped building new homes during the worst of the financial crisis , and we have n't caught up yet . 
  in norway you can find stuff [ like this ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/result?keyword=&amp;price_from=1000&amp;price_to=&amp;estate_size%2fliving_area_from=&amp;estate_size%2fliving_area_to=&amp;number_of_bedrooms_from=&amp;number_of_bedrooms_to=&amp;property_type=1&amp;plot%2farearange_from=&amp;plot%2farearange_to=&amp;sort=2 ) for around 20k in the countryside . 
  lots of work . 
  some are in the middle of nowhere , some are in very small towns . 
   and let 's not even talk about scandinavia , where the typical foods consist of fermented intestines . 
  typical uncultured americans , ca n't appreciate a lovely piece of fermented fish . 
  and why is this man so angry ? 
  what . 
  even norway has burger kings aplenty , its slightly better than mcdonalds . 
  i 've read that the population of russia is shrinking pretty dramatically , and that this part of the reason . 
  people are getting drunk and dying young instead of having families . 
  will be interesting ( and scary ) to see what effect that will have on the country over time . 
  because it was in norwegian and i translated it . 
  it was also crap statistics , so i deleted the whole thing . 
  yeah , it looked decent ( it was from eurostat and in a reputable newspaper ) until i looked a bit closer at some data . 
  deleted it now . 
  yeah , the data is starting to look supsciously wrong to me , even though its made by eurostat i think . 
  no irish cities in the survey :( : http://www.urbanaudit.org/rank.aspx, 
  yeah that one seemed weird to me , might be a mistake or some difference in measurement ? 
  i dont know the city , is it particularly rainy ? 
  in fact our weather service yr.no has it down as 62 days per year . 
  ** this list seems to be 90 % bullshit , if anyone has anything better it would be interesting to see ** source : someone claimed bergen was the rainiest city in europe , so i found [ this article ] ( http://www.bt.no/nyheter/klima/bergen-er-ikke-regnbyen-1901033.html#.uklpzuuz4ko ) . 
  the original source is [ this one  ( http://www.urbanaudit.org/index.aspx ) i think , which belongs to eurostat . 
  note that it this table counts days instead of amount , so in terms of that bergen ( 2,250 mm ( 89 in ) ) is almost twice as wet as glasgow ( 1,245 millimetres ( 49.0 in ) ) . 
  edit : it also seems that the data for volos in 12th place is completely and utterly wrong . 
  edit 2 : from the comments i 'm starting to suspect that half of this data may be completely made up , or its measured in some weird way . 
  edit 3 : i 'm a bit ashamed for posting this now , this list may be more correct , though it only includes eu27 : http://i.imgur.com/qnigv39.png, 
  [ the netherlands is actually biggger than i imagined ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/?show=12751 ) i like that if you cut out the first bit ( is that a ferry ? ), 
  it takes 3 hours to drive across the entire country . 
  i could n't even drive to another city in three hours :d, 
  i live at +1 and you can console yourself with the fact that it was probably raining at the time . 
  - `` hm , this island is full of ice , rocks , and volcanoes , and the weather is consistently terrible . '', 
  - '' feels like home , lets build a house here '', 
  theres a reason for the viking age . 
  and who could resist us with that kind of battle training . 
  oh , you sweet summer child . 
  i remember once when i was a kid we had to climb out of the second floor window because a snow drift covered the whole first floor . 
  and once on an army exercise i took a poo outside in -42 c , a proud moment and a memory for life . 
  in actuality it usually gets colder in inland europe than on the coast in norway ( last year it was around +15 c right before christmas ) , winters are surprisingly mild and wet , its just that our summers are also mild and wet . 
  i 'll guess you 'll find out what winter is all about soon enough , depending on where you live , 
  even here in norway winter is not until november . 
  enjoy the rain , wind for a month more before we get to the sleet . 
  spoken vowels , not necessarily written ones  danes have the most . 
  english actually has fewer vowels than the scandinavian languages ( which have the most in the world ) , so that bit is easy for us , 
  yeah , tuborg is better in denmark . 
  god jul og godt tub ' \u00e5r  if i had to choose a mass produced standard lager in norway i 'd go with aass , dahls or nordlands . 
  that table does n't even have ales :( , which of course is the traditional norwegian way of making beer . 
  almost died out completely except for home production on farms and in small towns ( especially in vestlandet ) . 
  making a comeback now i think . 
  yep , you can get that by for instance caramellising part of the mesh . 
  you take some of it out , boil it for a while until its more of a thick porridge , then put it back in . 
  its then fermented like a pilsner . 
  typical for some german brewing methods . 
  fun fact : it was about as popular as pilsners in norway up to ww2 , then it lost its popularity because of the german sounding name . 
  i dont disagree , but kids here drink it because its cheap ( for norway , i.e something like $ 2,2 per bottle ) . 
  there is some cheaper stuff , but its even worse . 
  yeah , i think tuborg ( gr\u00f8nn ) is more popular , and possibly carlsberg as well , but i was going for norwegian ones . 
  from working in a store i remember the alcoholics used to go for the cheap stuff in `` murer '' bottles ( 1.25 l plastic ) like seidel . 
  norway : ** most popular : ** i would venture to say maybe ringnes or hansa ( and they are both pretty shit pilsners ) ** best : ** [ n\u00f8gne \u00d8 ] ( http://www.nogne-o.com/ ) makes some amazing stuff , so does [ kinn ] ( http://www.kinn.no/vare-ol ) . 
  of the more mass produced ones i think aass and frydenlund ( bayer ) are decent . 
  and i just made a batch of ipa myself , which will of course be the best one  edit : a proper traditional `` farm brewed '' norwegian k\u00f8nnj\u00f8l is sort of smokey , little bitter flavor ( norwegian hops are mild ) and sometimes flavored with juniper berries and/or twigs . 
  sort of a pale ale . 
  if you can find slogen or fjord from trollbryggeriet its somewhere close . 
  just like norway !, 
  except norway is really big and important , really it is . 
  totally . 
  get a few guys and put together an irish luge team or something !, 
  unless the gypsies put a retard spell on you !, 
  they are similar in that they are all right populists , however this populism takes different forms in all parties . 
  they are certainly not * as * nationalist as sd and the finns . 
  the whole anti-tax and small government element is pretty much for gone now . 
  sure they want to remove a few fees and maybe some taxes , but they are not really for reducing spending , in fact they want to increase it . 
  yep . 
  pretty close , though they are not ethnic nationalists ( though there are some individuals in the party who certainly fit that bill ) . 
  they are socially conservative , but they also want to reduce taxes on alcohol and tobacco , so they are pretty much all over the place . 
  frp are n't really libertarian , they are right-wing populists . 
  they `` vote-maximize '' by going outside what should be their ideology and they are rather authoritarian ( strict prison sentences , strict rules for immigration , strict rules for sexual minorities ) and in that sense they are conservative . 
  they are also pro more government spending , which does n't fit with libertarianism at all . 
  produced by stargate , who also make songs for rihanna et.al . 
  i think norway may be the last country left where its free for non-eu students . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  venstre are supposed to be social liberals , so they do n't really fit that well on the right-left axis . 
  to me they are a true centre party , would n't look too odd in a coalition with sp and sv actually . 
  i 'll be very disappointed if they end up in a coalition with frp . 
  maybe , if we dont build for the future . 
  the fund is great and we also have abundant renewable hydro energy as well as fish and a strong maritime industry . 
  to counter this mans examples : - i 've never had to wait for more than a few days for anything , and i 've had x-rays and mris done the same day . 
  just spent a few evenings with my grandma at the hospital as well . 
  they picked her up in a helicopter and took really good care of her . 
  - there is very little crime compared to almost anywhere else . 
  - things are n't really expensive , they are very cheap if you take wages into consideration . 
  ignoring them is just retarded . 
  - education is free , there is very little corruption . 
  - politicians are decent and there is a certain level of technocracy and meritocracy about the state anyways - police do a good job . 
  here in western norway 188 of the last 191 murders have been solved . 
  when you 're saying that politicians did n't make us this rich you are actually kind of wrong , they could have gone for a free market solution with the oil fund , and we would have been much poorer today . . 
  the oil fund is managed well , it makes a lot of money . 
  however we could maybe invest more in a future where there is no oil ,
