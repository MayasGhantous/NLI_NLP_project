  lived there for a while , its really nice . 
  sure there is a bit of crime , but its still less than most any other comparably sized town in europe . 
  the problem they mostly have is that it was in a long decline as an industrial city , too few jobs . 
  seems to be getting better with the bridge and everything that comes with it . 
  it 's the ( pan - ) national pastime !, 
  you ca n't really `` take your business elsewhere '' in a capitalistic system either . 
  you get sick , call an ambulance , it drives you to the nearest hospital . 
  insurance then may or may not pay for you . 
  if not , then you 're fuck out of luck and in debt for the rest of your life . 
  health care simply is n't a business that is effectively regulated by the market . 
  medical technology on the other hand can be , though it tends to put a lot of money into lifestyle medical treatment ( overweight , heart disease etc ) instead of the diseases and problems that are making life terrible for billions of poor people . 
  http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhjkaocqta1qev59to1_400.gif it does n't matter if you win or lose , as long as you beat sweden < 3, 
  norway has had a left ( - centre ) government for the last eight years ( two terms ) . 
  this is a long time and its lead to some wear on the governing parties , now we will probably get a shift to either right or right-centre , though there does n't seem to be a clear cut coalition on the right , we may get a government with a minority in the national assembly . 
  jens stoltenbergs labour party is still the biggest , followed by `` the right '' , a moderate liberal party . 
  are you implying that belgium is a country and not just a place germany uses to fight people ? 
  can confirm that we are knee deep in cod . 
  cod . 
  my point is that its more often thinly veiled racism . 
  very thinly . 
  anyone can critisise religion as much as they want if you ask me . 
  and if you find `` culturalism '' valid , good luck with that . 
  judging groups of people because you think they belong to some `` culture '' is a small step above racism , you are not judging people on the basis of their individual ideas or opinions , but rather by some percieved association with a group . 
  lumping large groups of people together is a terrible idea , they may not have as much in common as it seems from the outside . 
  rather you should criticise ideas and practises that you find immoral or incompatible with society . 
  it means something like `` strife '' , `` battle '' or `` struggle '' , and implies violence and that there is something to fight against . 
  has certain connotations to far right wing rethoric , though it depends on the context . 
  in norway you 'll see a lot of people talking about islam ( because when you do n't say brown people its obviously not racism ) , and a surprising amount of people throwing around meaningless `` breivik-isms '' like `` cultural marxist '' about the political parties to the left . 
  scary and somewhat entertaining at the same time . 
  strid i think . 
  name sort of hints at something a bit right wing . 
  american . 
  yep . 
  if you could read norwegian i 'd show you the comment sections of mostly all our major news sites . 
  makes you lose faith in humanity . 
  people are morons and do n't understand economics . 
  stuff is cheap as fuck . 
  unless you 're a tourist . 
  most middle class families have two cars , a boat , a second home etc. 
  and work fairly short hours and they still complain . 
  norway : \u00c5lesund stayon 90/50 ( in theory , more like 40/20 ) 399 nok 49.45 eur edit : might get 100/100 fiber from altibox in a few months though . 
  they are digging cables . 
   and you have no direct influence on the legislation that is passed and will affect you . 
  no members of parliament , no commissioner , etc. 
  / u/sprm up there . 
  so there is that . 
  actually i think that is not the net sum . 
  the net sum should be $ 180 - $ 105 since the eu also spends money i the uk . 
  http://theforeigner.no/pages/news/norway-next-best-in-eu-directive-test/ vetos have happened once as far as i know , and it may be witdrawn after the election . 
  no we are not in cap , which played a huge part in why we said no in previous elections . 
  we are too small to have much clout in negotiatons anyway . 
  basically we have to follow directives , but we have very little say in them . 
  in theory we could veto , but then we 'd come under huge pressure from our biggest trade partner , which is the eu . 
  that said , i 'm against norway joining the eu at this stage . 
  i dont trust the eu in managing fishing rights and i want us to maintain agriculture in norway . 
  if well regulated it is . 
  sadly , there is a lot of over fishing . 
  i was a bit off . 
  though according to this http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union . 
  you are too . 
  net contribution to the eu in the uk is about $ 180 per person . 
  its about $ 86 per person in norway . 
  edit : actually i 'm not sure if i 'm reading this table right . 
  should uks net contribution be 180 -105 or should it be 180 ? 
  in terms of eu regulation you are just plain wrong . 
  we are too small to actually have a voice in the eu anyway . 
  we do have some more or less infinite natural resources ( fish and hydroelectric power ) . 
  but of course it will be hard times when the petroleum sector starts diminishing . 
  luckily we also have the pension fund . 
  we are more or less in the eu anyway . 
  we pay ~ ~ as much ~ ~ 85 % per person as the uk and we follow most of the eu regulations ( more than most in fact ) . 
  the only difference is our tolls on food imports and that we can regulate our own fisheries . 
  edit : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#net_contributors_and_recipients . 
  its hard to find out how much each country is contributing , but according to this the uk contributes $ 62,7 per capita . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://nocache.euskolen01.ezpublish.byte.no/norge-og-eu/hvor-mye-betaler-norge-til-eu/ ) we are actually contributing net around $ 86 per capita all in all . 
  i dont know if these numbers include the same things . 
  as far as i understand from my finnish friends finland puts a lot of resources into their teachers . 
  they are paid well and have long and good education , so it attracts some of the brightest and best . 
  getting into teaching at university can be as hard as getting into medicine !, 
  we are far behind our neighbours in pisa results , and i suspect that a lot of it has to with the fact that teachers are under paid and under valued . 
  teaching universities are half full of people who stumbled into it because it was what they could get into with mediocre grades . 
  vicious circle . 
  that being said the other half is full of good teachers , so its not all hopeless . 
  looking at all the parameters i dont think we were included at all , or else we would be in there somewhere . 
  i suspect that its selected countries . 
  oh , the humanity . 
  compare that to the lingonberry war of 1788 , where we lost 8 brave norwegians ( mostly from eating too much lingonberries ) . 
  yep . 
  we all made a change to windows 7 , never heard any discussion at all about swithcing to 8 . 
  they 've effectively eliminated one of their most important markets . 
  if i personally get a new pc or the office gets new ones i guess they might have 8 , but its hard to see a reason to `` upgrade '' . 
  assuming us people even know were mexico and central america are . 
  kidding aside i would certainly think they are central american , however iran does seem wrong and maybe the balkans should be eastern european ( and maybe latvia and lithuania ) ? 
  agree on georgia , turkey and armenia . 
  its hard to define since there are a lot of unclear cases . 
  our people are perfect ** and ** our culture is superior . 
  ( 100 % france ) ... and norway for that matter ( we are a bunch of smug bastards ), 
  and the uk and ireland as well , though its pretty hard to tell from the colors ( or am i going color blind ), 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/united_nations_geographical_subregions.png http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#europe but yeah , the reason spain is usually not included is the fact that it was relatively underdeveloped compared to the rest and also was n't a democracy until 1978 . 
  not everyone in the nordic countries would agree that we are `` west europe '' as well .
