  population of the nordic countries is about 50 % of spains , which is more south than west anyway . 
  we are probably pretty similar to for instance the uk , but the title is still inaccurate . 
  v : education and science , small business , personal freedom , enviroment ap : industry , unions , equality , not so much enviroment . 
  otherwise they are both sort of social democrats , most parties in norway have agree on a lot of things about the welfare state . 
  they would probably end up in different coalitions if in government . 
  yeah , the ranks are pretty thin behind her . 
  secret elections !, 
  not sure yet , sort of undecided between venstre ( social liberalist ) and arbeiderpartiet ( social democrats ), 
  oh , the northug-bj\u00f8rgen hype train has n't come into the station yet , its waiting for the first snowfall . 
  you guys should just put zlatan in the relay team , can not fail . 
  you 're given a receipt and you can check yourself if the vote is registered . 
  sure there is some risk to everything , but i 'm not worried more than when i 'm using my internet bank or voting on paper for that matter . 
  http://www.tu.no/it/2013/08/12/na-starter-e-valget its about 250.000 people . 
  edit : my biggest worry is the one in the top comment of that article :  snart kan vi stemme over internett . 
  yes !, 
  though its only in 12 municipalities this time , i just happen to live in one of them ( \u00c5lesund ), 
  * election time : * * pm jens stoltenberg drove a taxi around oslo . 
  the media are struggling to decide if they think its cute or a cheap trick . 
  despite what an article on here claimed a while back only a few ( out of the many ) we 're `` picked '' to ride , and they really did n't know much about it anyway . 
  * the green party are polling surprisingly well . 
  the `` socialist left '' party is doing poorly . 
  * looks like we might head for a blue government this time , though there is a lot of disagreement on the right . 
  * on a personal note i can now vote on the internet for the first time . 
  progress !, 
  * the very marginal party r\u00f8dt ( `` red '' ) arranged a rich people safari around oslo . 
  * other * : * we still suck at football , lost 4-2 to sweden * a lot of nurses with education from abroad ( australia , usa etc ) cant get their nursing license in norway , because their education is n't `` good enough '' for norwegian standards . 
  they mad . 
  * a comedian called rolv wesenlund died today :( . 
  * there has been some weather . 
  * we also suck at athletics . 
  yep . 
  its the same in norway ( and scandinavia ) . 
  we even have these [ nifty machines ] ( https://www.google.no/search?client=opera&amp;q=pantemaskin&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=nn&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=a7imuv6qm4mi4as8rodicq&amp;biw=1887&amp;bih=987&amp;sei=brimussmcc7y4qtu2ydwbq#facrc=_&amp;imgrc=quwobf3k4xp2mm%3a%3b99mkg9wjjxwi5m%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.f-b.no%252fpolopoly_fs%252fnytt-flaskepantlotteri-ved-inngangen-til-en-rema-1000-butikk-i-fredrikstad-har-r-de-kors-montert-sin-1.1814327!%252fimage%252f558862385.jpg_gen%252fderivatives%252fderivative_article_980%252f558862385.jpg%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.f-b.no%252fnyheter%252fkjemper-om-panten-1.1814328%3b980%3b652 ) in grocery stores that let you hand in bottles and cans :, 
  i think most would define them as southern europe . 
  so little discrimination going on there . 
  beat denmark 4-0 recently and have henrikh mkhkh . . mkth . . mkr . . that really good guy on boroussia dortmund, 
  ** \u00c5lesund ** : dried fish , covered life boats and upvotes in / r/pics, 
  so near to russia so far from japan, 
  i ca n't think of many in norwegian . 
  `` mail '' means exclusively e-mail . 
  fresh is used by fashion people to mean ... something ( or rather `` freeeesj '' ) . 
  theres a funny one in danish that i remember from living there , a ** `` rocker '' ** is a member of a motorcycle gang or something ( implied criminal as well i think ) . 
  we do of course bend english words as if they were norwegian , `` vi skal showcasee nye designs etter workshoppen '', 
  most of these are just anglisims . 
  except rowdy and pullunder i think . 
  more intelligent than sheep . 
  still very far from a human . 
  http://i.imgur.com/pj4n3tz.gif or maybe i should just put a magnet on a stick and hold it in front of my bicycle !!, 
  edit : no that wouldnt work , its made of aluminium :(, 
  where i live is windy ** and ** not flat at all . 
  cycling is pretty much hopeless . 
  the flatness is what does it , same in copenhagen . 
  distances between cities are large , but the cities themselves are like any other i guess . 
  i dont think people generally use electric cars to drive between cities , more for work commutes . 
  an * all electric * french car ? 
  now that ca n't possibly go wrong . 
  source : i own a renault, 
  japans whaling is terrible , but it has very little to do with icelands whaling . 
  whale is delicious and i ca n't really see any reason that eating it is worse than eating any other animal . 
  google translate i as close as it gets i guess , though some job adverts are in english it seems . 
  if you are serious you could try to look around http://www.nav.no/nav+eures+work+and+recruit+in+norway . 
  my company looks for electricians for ship building from time to time , but not right now as far as i can tell . 
  not sure if the electricians education translates 100 % between countries , regulations are very strict here for that kind of work . 
  one of our competitors is owned by an italian company , and they seem to have some electricians jobs , maybe you could try putting up your cv here : http://www.webcruiter.no/wcmain/advertviewpublic.aspx?oppdragsnr=1585862643&amp;company_id=254690591&amp;culture_id=en&amp;cols=7,2, 
  http://www.finn.no/finn/job/fulltime/result?sort=1&amp;job_category/category=5406&amp;job_category/subcategory=8203 go for it . 
  very long distances between small cities . 
  just not the same traffic, 
  i do n't know about other people , but i really get exited about new infrastructure too . 
  true , its a cool idea , but it 'll probably never be done ( at least not soon ), 
  who knows ? 
  their language is more or less incomprehensible  we do tend to refer to `` the continent '' as europe , though most norwegians definitely recognise that we are also european . 
  we are just scandinavian before that . 
  how long would it be ? 
  about 80 km ? 
  that would make it the longest in the world , 
  i 'm going to put it nicely ? 
  how does this make me wrong ? 
  for a great great majority in a european country this just is n't a concern for daily life , so people do n't care . 
  people should care maybe , but they dont . 
  60 % owned by the norwegian state . 
  because most of the stuff we send is even close to being important enough to bother with encryption . 
  and while people in principle care about their privacy , in practicality we dont unless its something very important . 
  it just does n't affect day-to-day life in any way . 
  true norwegians ski cross-country . 
  using a lift is for those southern fairies on the continent . 
  norwegians ski . 
  finns sauna ( and drink ), 
  no , denmark are terrible at hockey . 
  he did ask for moment ( s ) , the trade fleet ca n't really be considered that . 
   well , you also had a nazi government through out the war period , which made it for you to know about the whole holocaust before the jews suddenly disappeared . 
  huh ? 
  nasjonal samling were more or less instated by the germans . 
  they never had over 2 % of the votes and only got in power because the national assembly refused to cooperate with the germans . 
  no one knew about the holocaust at the time the jews disappeared . 
  still shameful to let people get deported by force though . 
  just pining for the fjords . 
  theres a movie about it too : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479937/?ref_=sr_1 its ok, 
  and we did n't do much to protect the jews from deportation either . 
  marks of shame on norway .
