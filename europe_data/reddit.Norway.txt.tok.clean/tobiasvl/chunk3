  but norway is n't in the european union . 
  there are a couple well known ones in norway . 
  as in , i just know of two people who have been in the media . 
  they 're considered batshit crazy . 
  one of them , a women , was thrown out of her house a couple of years ago because she did n't pay her mortgage or something . 
  she called her house `` niceland '' and claimed it was a sovereign nation . 
  hm , i 've never heard `` england '' used to refer to gb/uk, 
  look at the flair !, 
  i 'd say most norwegians have a healthy amount of nationalism . 
  every constitutional day ( may 17 ) most people celebrate and a lot of people celebrate in the streets . 
  i might check out the final , but not the semi . 
  yeah , lower secondary school in norway is mandatory , three years , from age 13-16 . 
  the one i talked about above , upper secondary school , is also three years ( or two years plus two years of internship for vocational studies ) , from 16-19 , and is optional ( but you need it if you want to take higher education ) . 
  i think your chances of finding someone who knows about both the norwegian and czech educational systems might be pretty slim , unfortunately . 
  i know very little about it , at least , but i can answer specific questions about the norwegian system , as i said . 
  but in general i think education is held in high esteem in czechia . 
  were n't they among the first countries to introduce mandatory education ? 
  secondary education is probably seen as something you basically just do ? 
  i 'm just guessing here , i 've never even been to czechia , but it 's probably cultural . 
  ( might also be a difference in definition , czechia is in the eu unlike norway ), 
  what 's your question exactly ? 
  why those two countries ? 
  i know nothing about the czech republic or its educational system , but in norway people attend upper secondary school ( `` videreg\u00e5ende skole '' ) mostly to prepare for higher education . 
  vocational education is less attractive than in other countries ( perhaps including czechia ? ) . 
  even vocational secondary school has a lot of theory now , to the chagrin of less theoretical pupils . 
  in some parts of the country jobs have traditionally been in petroleum ( engineering , requires higher education ) , farming ( requires no formal education , including secondary ) , and fishing ( ditto ) . 
  many people with secondary education in the cities take higher education , to completion or not . 
  a lot of more vocational jobs are covered by swedes , poles and other immigrants . 
  troll and [ nisser ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nisse_%28folklore%29 ), 
  in norway we call the czech republic `` tsjekkia '', 
  you 'd be the 19th since troms and finnmark are merging now . 
  probably more to come too . 
  are n't you more like slavs ? 
  started drinking properly and regularly at 15 or 16 . 
  i mostly had older friends who were 18 who bought it for me for their parties . 
  felt neither too early nor too late ( of course i drank with these older friends to whom drinking was no big deal , so it felt natural ) . 
  once in a while we drank some moonshine they 'd procured , though , which was a bit unnecessary in hindsight . 
  ( age limit for strong liquor is 20 , beer/cider/wine is 18 ), 
  they 're not language purists , they 're racists . 
  why is it revolting ? 
  what 's the issue with it ? 
  english is also a frankenstein-esque creation , btw . 
  it 's a german language with a lot of influence from romance languages . 
  revolting . 
  still water , usually tap water ( which is great here ) . 
  but sparkling water is also popular in the form of farris , a national treasure . 
  we explicitly call it farris , though . 
  oslo , norway . 
  there are traces of stone age settlements that are 10 400 years old . 
  there has been a city in the area since around year 1000 ad and it 's apparently northern europe 's second largest middle age city . 
  haha . 
  all righty then !, 
  we do n't say `` s\u00f8ta '' either . 
  the norwegian phrase would be `` s\u00f8te bror '' , we 're just affectionately writing in mock swedish . 
  sweden . 
  all our jokes are about swedes , we quarrel with swedes in all sports ( the important thing is n't to win , it 's to beat sweden ) , etc. 
   in america we do not have religious political parties due to our laws . 
  well , both your parties consist of religious people , so i 'm not sure what the difference is . 
  the republicans more so . 
  candidates for office talk about religion all the time . 
  officials say `` god bless america '' and pray for victims of natural catastrophes and terror . 
  most european countries have one christian party ; the us has two . 
  i 'm curious to know what laws you 're talking about . 
  the constitution says that the government ca n't favor any religion . 
  religious organizations ca n't be tax-exempt if they endorse political candidates . 
  and if laws exist that ban `` religious political parties '' ( whatever that is ) , what do they do ? 
  say that political parties ca n't use the names of religions in their name ? 
  who was your last non-christian president ? 
  jefferson , perhaps ? 
  apparently four presidents have not sworn in on a bible , so i guess there might be more , but usually it 'd be considered political suicide to be an atheist . 
  not so in the majority of europe , where religion is strictly kept out of any political party except for the religious parties . 
   the only `` christian issue '' we have here in america i can think of are abortion and contraceptive rights . 
  well , when you 're a christian , most issues are christian issues . 
  social conservatism is more or less christian moral values wrapped in politics . 
  * israel * education ( creationism , sex ed ) * euthanasia * surrogacy * drugs ( legalizing marijuana , the war on drugs ) * lgbt issues ( even if the religious in the us have given up on gay marriage , social conservatism is strong , cf. 
  the trans person toilet issue ) * foreign aid ( in europe , christian parties usually give a lot of foreign aid and are positive to refugees ; in the us , the fight against `` godless communists '' in the cold war made judeo-christian values much more politically important , and aid to non-judeo-christians less important ) http://www.bu.edu/cas/magazine/fall15/america/, 
   what are the christian parties that i hear about in europe ? 
  yeah , there are lots of christian parties in europe . 
  see : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democracy * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centrist_democrat_international  are these parties actually solely christians focusing on christian issues and ideas ? 
  not at all . 
  in norway we have the [ christian democratic party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democratic_party_ ( norway \\ ) ) . 
  they had the prime minister between 1997 and 2000 , and have been part of other coalitions ( and are currently a support party for the coalition government , although not a part of it ) , so they have long experience with governance . 
  internationally i guess ours is pretty left-leaning for a christian party ; they 're centrist , with conservative vies on social issues and leftist views on economic issues : * they think it 's ok for gay people to enter civil unions , but not to marry and adopt kids * they 're neutral on gay clergy , calling it an issue for the church ( norway had a state church until january 1st this year ) * they support accessibility to contraception as a way of lowering abortion rates , and they do think abortion is ok in cases of rape or when the mother 's life is at risk * they passed strict biotechnology laws last time they were in power, 
  can i only choose between the two ??? 
  oh , i guess that 's how it is in the us . 
  a million different frozen pepperoni pizzas to choose from at walmart , just two viable political parties . 
  democrat then . 
  what 's graduate school exactly ? 
  its own school for people who have bachelors ? 
  i do n't understand your question . 
  in my country we have universities , which offer bachelor grades , master grades and phds . 
  there 's no separate school for stuff above bachelor grade . 
  admittance to university is done on background of your upper secondary school ( or high school ) grades . 
  some programmes also require you to have taken specific courses in secondary school , like computer science which usually requires you to have taken advanced math . 
  badly edit : [ it would seem i was right ] ( https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/videos/1692462444114149/ ), 
  hey , come on , do n't be like that . 
  norway , sweden and denmark pretty much speak the same language already , norway has been in unions with both denmark and sweden fairly recently , etc. 
  we 'll probably warm up to you , but we 're already like siblings over here and you 're more like a cousin . 
  heeeeey , 
  sure , happens often here in norway too .
