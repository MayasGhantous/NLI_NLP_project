  well , not completely empty chambers . 
  if the outcome of a vote is known beforehand the parties will all dismiss some of their members of parliament proportionally so the result of the vote will be the same , but people do n't have to come in . 
  i guess that 's the same thing that happens in the us , and the reason you have whips ? 
  ( i do n't know much about your system of government except from what i 've seen on house of cards , lol . ), 
  it 's ok by me , they 're busy people and have more important stuff to do than to debate stuff that 's already de facto decided . 
  ours does n't have a name , but while we were in a union with sweden the flag was called `` the herring salad '' because it was so busy and looked like herring salad which is eaten a lot in both countries : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_mark_of_norway_and_sweden#gallery, 
  why do you have to explain it ? 
  do americans assume you 're an american with swedish heritage ? 
  yeah , here in norway that 's entirely possible . 
  oslo , our capital , has 650k people in the city and about 1 million in the urban/metropolitan area . 
  it 's also surrounded by ~ 300 km ^ 2 of forested area called [ marka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marka,_oslo ) which you can get to pretty quickly . 
  parts of it is protected by law as a recreational area where you ca n't live , though , but [ s\u00f8rkedalen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%b8rkedalen ) is an example of a populated part of marka that is close to the city . 
  i live in an apartment/condo building , we have a common area with washing machines and dryers . 
  we also have our own private washing machine , but sometimes use the dryers in the basement ( mostly we hang the clothes to dry in the attic though ) . 
  they 're pretty common . 
  i guess it 's because about half the year it 's freezing outside , so people ca n't really dry their clothes in their gardens ( and people in apartment buildings do n't have gardens ) . 
  merkel is the german chancellor ( about the same as a pm ) , yes . 
  right now it 's king harald v and his `` commoner wife '' queen sonja . 
  harald 's dad was king olav v , and his mom was queen m\u00e4rtha ( the daughter of a swedish prince and danish princess ) . 
  king olav 's dad was king haakon v. haakon was our first modern monarch after getting out of unions with denmark and then sweden . 
  we had a vote after dumping sweden on whether or not to become a monarchy . 
  we did and chose prince carl of denmark to be our king in 1905 , and he changed his name to haakon v . he was married to princess maud of the uk . 
  i identity with the whole of norway , then scandinavia and the north ( aka the nordic countries ) and then europe . 
  28 days later, 
  pretty boring . 
  mostly consists of criticism of the press and its clickbait headlines . 
  sure . 
  some people peel their cooked potatoes , but many do n't , and nobody does it with `` new potatoes '' ( not sure what it 's called in english , spring potatoes maybe ? ), 
  how does raising children differ between ancestries in na ? 
  how much of the original culture enters into that upbringing ? 
  it just sounds a litttle irrelevant . 
  if someone lives in the us and is `` raised '' in a way that matters as norwegian somehow , what does that even mean or entail ? 
  it 's ridiculous for many reasons . 
  i 'm norwegian , but my heritage ( my grandparents ) is swedish , danish , german and faroese ( yet i do n't call myself anything else than norwegian ) . 
  if i moved to the us , though , my kids and grandkids would call themselves norwegian , nothing else . 
  it 's a cherry picking of culture that only goes back to the point of immigration and no further , even though europe has mixed heritage as well - somehow , the us is the only melting pot . 
  then there 's the whole african-american thing . 
  the pride in heritage somehow only applies to the variety that is white and asian people . 
  irish-american , italian-american , chinese-american ... and african-american , no matter where they come from . 
  ( i 'm not implying that black people do n't care about their heritage here !, 
  i 'm implying that a black person of italian descent would be called an african-american , not an italian-american . ), 
  irish-americans have heritage from the uk . 
  what about english-americans ? 
  oh , they 're just wholesome americans , good old wasps . 
  and many other issues as well . 
  it 's a beehive . 
  the progress party ( frp ) , norway 's far-right party , is currently polling at around 13 % . 
  they 're in a coalition government with the conservative party now , which they achieved in an election where they got 16.3 % ( which was itself lower than their previous election ) . 
  i 'd chalk the decrease up to government fatigue , pretty sure trump has n't affected it much . 
  pssh , i just asked the guy what he meant specifically . 
  i do n't hate the us ( or nato ) , but as a global superpower they have done some things that were n't objectively benevolent . 
  like any superpower . 
  agreed , but i 'm not sure if op agrees with you on that last part judging by his post history, 
  `` god emperor '' ? 
  like the fat worm dictator from dune ? 
  wtf no, 
  what low-gdp countries have an average or good level of life then ? 
  what makes the us a more benevolent superpower than russia/china ? 
  serious question . 
  well , if the us has a lax attitude towards nato , which trump has signaled , then also russian world domination ? 
  right ? 
  it is the most conservative administration in decades , therefore it ca n't be too bad ? 
  how does that logically follow ? 
  so if the government just became more and more conservative every four years it could only be positive ? 
  guests wear shoes in the homes of all you other countries ?? 
  here everyone takes their shoes off inside a home . 
  if someone 's just popping in for something they 'll usually stand awkwardly in the hallway , and the onus is on the host to say `` oh , just come in , leave your shoes on '' and the guest will have to say `` oh really ? '', 
  and the host will have to say `` sure sure '' and wave them in . 
  only then is it ok to walk inside with shoes on . 
  to add to this : * `` kron ( e ) '' / `` crown '' is the obverse / `` heads '' which often displays the _ head _ of a person , which in monarchies often is a royal / _ crowned _ person . 
  * `` mynt '' / `` coin '' is the reverse / _ tail _ end which displays the monetary value of the coin, 
  do you hang out at / r/norsk and it 's discord ? 
  well , americans think doing the pledge of allegiance every morning in school is normal too . 
   here in lithuania , for example , you 're legally * required * to raise your flag on national celebrations , or else you pay a fine . 
  uuuuh wtf lithuania , that 's fucked up . 
  wow , how do dutch people not know that part of their history, 
  assume they have mental problems, 
  here in norway it 's just first name , all the time , for anyone . 
  we 've become very informal here . 
  we have `` herr/fru/fr \u00f8ken '' for `` mr/mrs/ms '' but it 's hardly ever used anymore . 
  ca n't think of a situation where it would be warranted . 
  we also do n't have an equivalent to `` sir/ma ` am '' like english . 
  it 's just `` du '' ( informal `` you '' ) or first name nowadays . 
  norwegian used to have a formal `` you '' like german and so on , `` de/dem '' , but it is n't used anymore either . 
  the royal family have their own thing ( we address them in the third person , `` the king/queen '' if we 're talking to them ) though . 
  well , so did sweden . 
  well op said europe anyway , not eu, 
  rock , scissors , paper, 
  i 'm 29 , been married a little over two years . 
  nothing . 
  i almost never use cash . 
  ca n't remember the last time i did . 
  what country ? 
  you said in your post that vat could n't be the only reason , but your example has about a 15 % ( less ) price difference . 
  vat is often more than that in european countries . 
  in my country ( norway ) it 's 25 % . 
  yeah , but that 's a pretty rare situation !, 
  here in norway i grew up with swedish children 's shows , and nowadays everyone watches danish tv shows and movies . 
  books , memes and other written stuff , not so much . 
  although the english literacy in scandinavia is so high that i bet we consume as much american-english culture as brits do , and maybe more british stuff than americans do ( just guessing here ) .
