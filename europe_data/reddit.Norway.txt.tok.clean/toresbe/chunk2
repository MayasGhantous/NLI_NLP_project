  it 's frightening . 
   if 3 million men suddenly moved there it would be chaos . 
  good thing that 's a ** completely absurd scenario ** then , is n't it ? 
   you believe that by simply being eritrean asylum should be automatically granted , and the minister is saying that it should be on a case by case basis to determine validity and not have an open door to unlimited amounts of people . 
  i do in fact not believe what you say i do . 
  everyone is in agreement that a system founded for protection from persecution - asylum - must verify that there is a genuine persecution to shield someone from . 
  and the scale of such an institute must be decided upon by reasoned debate . 
  hyperbolic and arguments irrational to the point of insanity such as `` so we should invite all six million people of eritrea to norway then ? '', 
  does nothing for such a debate . 
  the problem is that having government-organized extradition to eritrea is a direct cooperation with possibly the most repressive regime in the world . 
  the question is not whether we 're willing to `` bring on the tsunami of immigrants '' , but whether there is no depth norway will sink to in order to return half a thousand people to a a country where * we have no possible way to confirm that they are not being persecuted upon repatriation by the extensive inhuman regime of torture and barbaric imprisonment which we know to exist * . 
  that is my point . 
  i want to shield people from torture , and if that means that these five hundred people move to my country and build their lives here , some of which might not have meet our strict criteria of a legitimate need for protection , then i actually do prefer that to a hundred - or even ten - people being sent to die gruesome deaths at the hands of a torturer , which ** will ** happen . 
  to present it as anything else , such as my being in favour of the whole-scale transportation of all eritreans to norway , does nothing but cloud the debate , and i wonder if that 's not exactly why you do it . 
  the idea that * everyone * with a financial motive to move will do so is a totally red herring and the idea that a country would be laid barren by emigration is absurd . 
  norway was once in the utter depths of poverty too , and although many emigrated to minnesota , most curiously decided to stay behind . 
   you 're still not answering the question , dismissing it as a hypothetical does n't make it disappear i 'm dismissing it as a dumb-ass question , because ** of course i 'm not in favour of moving the entire population of eritrea to norway ** . 
  i think everyone knows that too , and such a self-evidently absurd hypothetical does not belong in a debate between reasonable people , but serves only to dumb it down . 
  you could make any case about the commons in this absurd line of reasoning : `` i 'm happy you want people to have access to health care , but do n't force me to pay for it '' , or even `` i 'm happy you want people to drive on public roads , but do n't force me to pay for it '' . 
  democracy does n't work that way , and no society can . 
  minorities have constitutional protection of their freedom to argue their case , assemble and worship , but laws are written by the majority and imposed upon all . 
  the bureaucratic desire to isolate yourself from the suffering of fellow human beings because they do n't have the right paperwork has an impact on the moral standing of my society , and therefore me as a member of it , so we 're both using our votes to opine what is the appropriate measure . 
  please get off your high horse and stop playing the victim card . 
  both choices - isolation or compassion - are choices in and of themselves , with advantages and disadvantages . 
  i simply happen to feel that insular norway should get the hell over this rather racist fear of `` the others '' and move the dial ever so slightly in the direction of compassion - and , in the shameful example of syria , save some innocent lives hurt by the same wars that we profit immensely from . 
  i did , i simply did not give an answer which fits well into the fantasy of the immigrant tsunami . 
  while i 'm frustrated by your egotism , i do n't share it and certainly please do n't force your selfishness onto me and my family . 
  because we have a human obligation not to send innocent people to die because they wanted to escape tyranny ? 
   6 + million people in eritrea . 
  3 million of them men . 
  ... uhhh ... yeah ? 
  that tends to be the normal distribution of gender . 
  how is it relevant ? 
   are you suggesting norway should be obliged to take them all in if they came knocking ? 
  no , because norway is not the only other country than eritrea . 
   what is the controversy then ? 
  if the asylum application of these individuals have been rejected on the basis that they are not in need of asylum the point is that anyone who has tried to flee eritrea will essentially be in need of asylum . 
  i do n't think you fully comprehend quite how oppressive a regime eritrea is , but it might be a useful indicator that it is the only nation in the world gauged by reporters without borders as being less free than ** north korea ** . 
  there are tens of thousands of political prisoners , jailed underground and in freight containers . 
  it is every bit as absurd a thought that a person could be returned safely to eritrea , as it is that a person might be returned safely to north korea after attempting to flee . 
  every country in the world has an obligation to offer a sanctuary for people who want to flee such incredibly brutal oppression , rather than wash our hands of it like barbarians . 
  the notion that we would suffer a catastrophic tsunami of forriners if we even afforded ourselves some basic human decency is bunk . 
  that 's kind of cool , istr some historical trivia about the communist party in trondheim ( norway ) wanting to buy tatra trams . 
  guess they might have been right about that one . 
  and as a gauge of how the people of finnmark felt about this : in the 1945 parliamentary election the moscow-run norwegian communist party had [ 49.4 % of the popular vote ] ( http://www.ssb.no/a/kortnavn/stortingsvalg/histtab/t-1945prosent.html ) in its most populous circuit of alta - and over 35 % in the sixties , by which time it had been reduced to its rightful status as a tiny cult everywhere else . 
  yes , that 's precisely the problem . 
  they 're posing this as if it 's a uniquely barbaric or environmentally hostile method of hunting , when * their * problem with it is that it is * hunting * . 
  they 're misleading everyone because they think the ends of having one less animal dying by human hands ( and thus a whole lot more of them dying slowly from starvation in population swings ) justify the means ; dishonestly presenting seal hunting as particularily unethical . 
   why would they be shy about it because the tories are perceived as a nasty , selfish party . 
  for good reason , i might opine . 
  the party does not specify * weight * , only the number of tins . 
  so , three tins of sardines : 321g , one tin of fish balls , 800g . 
  i do n't think they have factored in the price of shipping to either sahara or the north pole , however . 
  maybe the fish balls will be cheaper ? 
  crazy religion tends to have little connection to the tenets of the religion they are crazy * about * . 
   germany gave no fucks about jewish physics . 
  ftfy , it 's been a while, 
  afaik , norway 's problem is n't * primarily * the population density ( which * is * very low ) , or even our crazy topography , it 's the population dispersion . 
  we have made a political decision to support people living in the districts , which affects us in many ways . 
  one of the negative ways is that we can not really invest the massive amounts of money in constructing arteries that sweden , for instance , can - as their population is far more concentrated in urban areas . 
   the natives could head to the supermarket if they really wanted food and only food . 
  where do you think the seal meat in our supermarkets come from ? 
  yeah , and most people believe that because there is no mobilized mass organization that could call peta on their absolute bullshit . 
  i 'm fairly comfortable in speculating that they really have n't thought this all through . 
  but considering the norwegian legal climate , product quality and market rates , i would n't recommend an american travelling here to get stoned . 
  there are some aspects which are very satisfying too , but which are not possible to appreciate without understanding the history of our tense border with russia . 
  they suggest we distance ourselves from nato because nato 's focus on our border with russia has waned , and suggests as an alternative a defence pact with israel , with frequent common exercises . 
  the idea of idf in an exercise around the varanger garnison is just a tremendously pleasing mental image , is n't it ? 
  what ethics ? 
  seals are adorable ? 
  well , so is mutton but we all dig in . 
   `` european citizens have the right to refuse to become accomplices in massacres ( ... ) '' fucking hippies , fucking peta ... 
  there 's nothing more annoying than this incredibly uninformed opposition to hunting seals , seemingly for no other reason than them being cute . 
  well , so is mutton , and so are chickens , but y' all seem to dig in regardless . 
  since there are no significant trade interests in seal products in these countries , they know their completely incorrect claims about seal hunting are allowed to remain unchallenged by counter-argument . 
  so they know they can be full of shit in a way that they could n't be if they were discussing deer or mutton . 
  the hunting exists under strict regulation of both ecological quotas and animal cruelty laws , quite possibly some of the most stringent regulation in the world . 
  in many regions , seals have * no natural predators * , which * requires * culling to protect the ecosystem . 
  the quotas are set after recommendations by the international council for the exploration of the sea and our own marine research council , but the depressed international demand thanks to shit like this is actually making it impossible for us to meet the quotas * recommended by marine biologists * to ensure a stable population and protect fishing populations . 
   brussels argues that the eu public strongly favours the ban due to concerns over hunting methods such as using a club with a metal spike -- a `` hakapik '' -- to stun seals before killing them , and has presented what it says is convincing scientific evidence that such methods are cruel . 
  i 'll defer to scientific evidence if it offers a compelling counter-argument , but the hakapik is a sharpened metal spike which is first forcefully hammered with the dull end into the back of the seal 's head , crushing the cranium , then turning around and and killing it instantly by crushing the brain with the sharpened end . 
  the hakapik is so sure to kill , in fact , that the norwegian [ laws on seal hunting ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flovdata.no%2fdokument%2fsf%2fforskrift%2f2003-02-11-151%2f%25c2%25a71%23%c2%a71&amp;edit-text= ) allow hunting adult seals with a rifle , but * require * the use of a hakapik to deliver a coup de gr\u00e2ce and ensure it truly is dead . 
  what do you think seals eat , rainbows ... ? 
  norwegian quotas for seal hunting are set after recommendations by the international council for the exploration of the sea and our own marine research council . 
   it does sound cruel . 
  that does sound cruel but it is also wrong . 
  a hakapik is not used to * stun * seals . 
  it 's a sharpened metal spike , where the dull end is first forcefully hammered into the back of the head of the seal , crushing the cranium , making it * instantly * unconscious , and then immediately turned around , crushing the brain . 
  it is such a certain killer that in fact , the [ laws on seal hunting ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flovdata.no%2fdokument%2fsf%2fforskrift%2f2003-02-11-151%2f%25c2%25a71%23%c2%a71&amp;edit-text= ) require that a seal which has been shot with a gun , * must * be given a coup de grace with the hakapik to ensure it is dead . 
  well , i do n't know , man ... their inclusions of sardines as an alternative does show a real commitment to pragmatism here . 
  edit : so , i did the extensive calculations . 
  a tin of sardines [ is nok 26.20 ] ( http://www.retthjem.no/shop/index.aspx?intshopcmd=&amp;group=86269&amp;prod=115611 ) , whereas fish balls [ is nok 52.30 ] ( http://www.retthjem.no/shop/index.aspx?intshopcmd=&amp;group=20684795&amp;prod=116255 ), 
  oh , there are some truly precious crazy christian microparties in all of europe , i 'm sure . 
  but i do n't know if any can compete with `` norwegian christians '' . 
  i was actually at the labour youth congress when i discovered this and i was reading this out loud to my group of friends ; we were in tears of laughter . 
  what makes this document so great is that it is so amazingly absurd and even self-contradictory , but still manages to preseve a tone of the `` official-sounding '' language of a political programme . 
  i 'll translate some highlights - let me know if you want more , i gave up while i was halfway through :  ** electoral programme , 2012-2016 **  this program is in accordance with the principles of norway 's christians , ( . . ) inspired and supported by god via the holy spirit . 
  ( ... ) in conflicts of interpretation , the founders of norway 's christians are infallible . 
   ( ... )  suicide is against god 's will ; only he can end life . 
  we wish to criminalize all forms of suicide .
