  just venturing a guess : i 'm sure there 's anonymous data where people have responded about whether or not they have been victims of sexual assault , and that gives you a useful baseline to compare against ? 
  or , immigrants ( as an inherent result of starting from scratch ) have poorer socio-economic standing in the society . 
  when you correct for that , the difference in ethnicity disappears . 
  so what you should have been saying is `` they were working class ? 
  no suprise there ! '', 
  - which would actually be more intelligent, 
   povert , violence - do n't you think an immigrant , from wherever they come from , will reflect a part of that ? 
  that 's a way to formulate it so that it sounds innocent on the surface and i 'm more than willing to assume that you may have the most innocent motives in stating it . 
  it is very important to differentiate between saying someone is racist , and saying that something a person has said is racist . 
  but i ask you to scratch the surface here . 
  even if the hypothesis is intuitively reasonable , the reality is that from criminal statistics , this is not the case . 
  the people who emigrate from conflict or poverty largely do so because they want to escape their roots , reinvent and build a new life for themselves . 
  people take the immense risks of flight for a reason . 
  the racism lies in this : even though there is no statistical evidence to back up the claim that somalis are predisposed to rape - and quite a lot of forensic statistics to the contrary , he 's ignoring the scientific evidence . 
  why is he ignoring that scientific evidence i could only speculate , but the result is that he is making a contra-factual claim that paints somalis in a bad light , a claim that plays upon sexual fear in a way that almost all racism does . 
  basically , he 's distorting reality to make an ethnic group look bad ( and you ca n't separate blanket claims about nationalities and ethnicities ) , and that * is * racism . 
  what else could motivate it ? 
  surely if someone was aiming to prevent the incidence of these horrible crimes , they would actually base themselves on scientific evidence and not prejudice ? 
   who do you think the vast majority of rape victims by immigrant hands are ? 
  dutch ? 
  germans ? 
  other immigrants . 
  well of * course * it is . 
  so what ? 
  the vast majority of rape * always * occurs in the immediate circle of friends and family . 
  i do n't think it 's meaningful to say that naziism is to be taboo when we are discussing europe 's issues with xenophobia, 
  no , there is n't a single definition of racism that `` we go by '' . 
  to the extent that there exists consensus , though , most serious definitions would agree that `` somalis are rapists '' is racist . 
  there 's a reason i care about this shit - and that is that it 's stupid - it is the imposition of stupidity by the intellectually lazy upon the innocent , and it nearly killed me on ut\u00f8ya . 
  well , the whole world in a million ways which underpin our ability to function together - we would n't be having this discussion without standards work by the international telecommunications union of the un , for one - but fine , let 's go by british law which defines a racial group as `` any group of people who are defined by reference to their race , colour , nationality ( including citizenship ) or ethnic or ** national ** origin '' . 
  no , it 's just that i do n't share this strange fetish my country has for pretending that nothing is racist by creating impossibly contrived and narrow definitions of it , because i find it to be intellectually cowardly in the extreme . 
  in british law , race is defined as `` any group of people who are defined by reference to their race , colour , nationality ( including citizenship ) or ethnic or national origin '' . 
  un defines racial discrimination as `` any distinction , exclusion , restriction , or preference based on race , colour , descent , or ** national ** or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life '' . 
  whatever definition you go by , saying `` somalis rape our women '' is n't just racist , it 's * really really fucking racist * . 
  what the everloving fuck are you talking about ? 
  that comment is as overtly racist as a burning cross . 
  racism is racism even when it is based on national origin . 
  dude !, 
  a ) his comment , currently the top-voted comment because this is / r/europe , is `` they were somali 's ? 
  gosh , no fucking surprise there , eh ? '', 
  b ) i am actually participating in the thread and referring to real statistical evidence why this is all some racist bullshit, 
  they do , it 's just that their statistics are processed by statisticians who are trying to find the truth , rather than propaganda for a far-right agenda - so they do n't actually come up with the result `` forriners are raping our white women '', 
  my `` side '' ? 
  i 'm not on any side . 
  i converse with other individuals as an individual . 
  this is n't a football match . 
  i 'm also not looking to `` normalize '' . 
  but assuming you will be able to understand norwegian , i refer you to the [ oslo police district 's 2010 report on sexual assault ] ( https://www.politi.no/vedlegg/lokale_vedlegg/oslo/vedlegg_1309.pdf ) , which actually does examine these claims - see especially the end of page 17 which explicitly warns against doing what you 're doing , and pages 51 through 60 where they address ethnicity . 
  it has been researched quite thoroughly , it just turns out that when you do the statistical due dilligence and run the numbers properly , ethnicity ceases to be statistically significant . 
  but that 's not the result quite a lot of people want , so they ignore it . 
  [ this 2010 report by statisticians the oslo police precinct ] ( https://www.politi.no/vedlegg/lokale_vedlegg/oslo/vedlegg_1309.pdf ) , called `` sexual assault in a global city '' , largely discredits it . 
  i 'll translate the salient points : again , it must be stressed that the strong over-representation of people with minority backgrounds for many types of sexual assaults can not be interpreted to say that immigrant cultures represents a causal link with sexual assaults . 
  only a very small minority of sexual assault are reported to police , and the probability of reporting is not equal between ethnically norwegian perpetrators , and perpetrators of other ethnicities . 
  furthermore , thorough , quantitative research shows that the statistical differences in criminal behavior between ethnic groups vanish completely if statistical factors of socio-economic backgrounds are corrected for . '', 
  [ here 's a document where they touch that pole . 
  bad choice of words . 
  edit : [ here 's another one , explicitly about ethnicity ] ( https://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f1800012697/1371914727881/2005_17_brottslighet_bland_personer_fodda_sverige_och_utlandet.pdf ) from sweden, 
  ah yes , the old go-to classic . 
  get out the racism card card !, 
  dude , your comment was about as overtly racist as it gets . 
  you do n't get to combine that with indignation when you 're called on it . 
  own up to it or stop saying racist stuff . 
  the un defines racial discrimination as : '' ... any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , color , descent , or ** national or ethnic origin ** ... '' . 
  people are taxonomically speaking of a single race , and since the discrimination is rooted in the same primitive instincts of `` us-tribe '' and `` them-tribe '' it 's basically the same problem whether the discrimination is based on skin colour , nationality , or toilet paper placement preferences ( fwiw , it 's over and the people who think it 's under are heathen infidels ) . 
  because it always takes an order of magnitude more effort to disprove bullshit than to say it . 
  if you want to substantiate the extraordinary claim that * this * time , claiming `` foreigners rape our white women '' is n't just racist propaganda like it was all the other times throughout european history , but actually an expression of intellectual courage to confront hard truths , then you 're going to have to do better than some random blog , and until you do i will not consider it credible . 
  it 's not like this claim does n't pop up like clockwork . 
  it was a staple of nazi propaganda , and the 2001 , 2006/2007 and 2011 `` rape wave '' in oslo - yes , that 's the term the press widely use - turned out , after statistical analysis , to be fictions . 
  oslo is the safest capitol city in northern europe . 
  the result is that women are afraid to go outside because the media wanted ad views and the racists wanted to blame the immigrants . 
  nobody is ignoring that , but what worries me is this combination of excessively distorting statistics in order to propagandize with the same primitive sexual fears that nazi propaganda made rich use of , while at the same time explaining these results with how much more primitive they are . 
  and invariably , when you do the due statistical dilligence and correct for confounding factors - which is what you do if you 're actually interested in the truth - it all disappears . 
  and then , the people who make the claim will accuse those who actually crunch the numbers properly of being naive or politically correct because they do n't agree that obviously they are bad . 
  but evidently shitty men with shitty attitudes come from holland too edit : / r/europe is the only subreddit i hang out in where the downvotes somehow feel like upvotes - i welcome your hatred !, 
   if you are a norwegian without some kind of dual citizenship you are not a european citizen . 
  norway is not part of the eu . 
  nonsense . 
  europe is a geographical entity , eu is a political one . 
  the borders of the continent did n't change with the maastricht treaty . 
   as an actual european citizen : i disagree with you completely . 
  i 'm sure - many do , but the majority do n't thus my use of `` largely '' and `` most people '' . 
   the eu was explicitly created with the goal of providing equality among citizens and promote peace . 
  well , the eu was created to tie the economies of europe together so tightly that another war would be infeasible , sure . 
  just as the united states was created for the purpose of democracy . 
  large powers always have to balance strategic interests - some of the time , they do so incorrectly . 
  but there will never be a perfect saint in the situation . 
    but most people think such things are a fair quid pro quo .

  [ pew research center has this statistic on general attitude towards the us ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/group/3/ ) , [ and this refers more directly to nato ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/1-nato-public-opinion-wary-of-russia-leary-of-action-on-ukraine/#_toc421286323 ) , arguably a more direct gauge of the support fo rthat presence . 
   but of course a norwegian would support the us : they are the ones buying all the shitty norwegian oil , making norway rich and wanting a lot more while polluting at rates several times worse than china ( thereby counteracting the global effort to fight pollution ) . 
  ridiculous . 
  although you 're right that norway does get wealthy by polluting the world and that really sucks , our exports to efta countries is twenty times greater than to the us . 
  our exports to belgium alone are greater than those to the us . 
  as a european citizen , let me note : europe is really largely quite happy with american influence . 
  our interests and values generally align . 
  the us did force europe 's hand in its post-war development by such things as attaching conditions to the marshall plan , but most people think such things are a fair quid pro quo . 
  my joke as a chronically late person is that the issue with punctuality is that there 's never anyone around to appreciate it,

  let 's be honest , the economy is not so bad that you can realistically be unable to source 10 % of the value of a company you got from your parents . 
  yeah , but if the gesture is a symbolic reaffirmation of the status quo , how can it be a u-turn ?
