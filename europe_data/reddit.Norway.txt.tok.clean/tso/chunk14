  one that came about by states competing with each other on creating the most favorable environment for starting businesses . 
  end result are corporations with very broad charters and such that make it very hard to dismantle them legally . 
  name , yes . 
  addresses ? 
  nope . 
  the issue was that one could rip large lists via various techniques , and then cross reference that with phone records . 
  indeed . 
  there was a massive hissy fit when the law was passed that allowed fra to tap signals crossing the swedish border , because many norwegian service providers were storing customer data in swedish data centers . 
  i seem to recall the specter raising its head in the 90s when the yeltsin staff apparently lost track of the remove control suitcase . 
  the thing is in part that the last generation of cold war hawks are still in office around the world . 
  we likely need some 30 + more years to fully clear them out , and pray we do not get a last hurray from either party before then . 
  quite right . 
  fra spies on us natives while nsa spies on swedish natives , and then they share data while maintaining the legal definition of only spying on foreigners ... 
  sounds like the simple response from the networks on this , hike their prices to the point that domestic callers pay what used to only be foreign roaming charges ... 
  germans and russians did fight on norwegian soil however . 
  not that it get much attention by media or such . 
  nah , it is just a edible relative to napalm . 
  try [ lutefisk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lutefisk ) if you want a wmd of the chemical/biological kind ... 
  clearly subterranean telecom cables were a bad idea ... 
  price is very much relative , as the gold standard is long gone . 
  first i heard of the issue was a satw comic . 
  animals we can feed the year round , plants only grow for a few short months ... 
  sounds a bit harsh ... 
  err , i thought a recent set of graphs had debunked this . 
  what makes it expensive is the exchange rates , not the prices themselves ( they are in general below the european average in terms of how much a average wage gets you ) . 
  with exchange rates complicating the image greatly . 
  a biology lab is about as atypical as you can get these days , as it will likely be on the forefront of science and so attract the brightest minds regardless of background . 
  and cities have a habit of being bright spots . 
  i do see that i was not careful enough in my initial wording . 
  i did n't mean to imply that the ignorance would be complete . 
  but that it would be worryingly high . 
  not that it is a uniquely american phenomena , it is just that having such a large nation of uniform language and customs seems to magnify the issue . 
  and sadly our modern communications technology makes it both easy to interact with foreign cultures and views , and to find like-minded individuals to insulate oneself from such views . 
  observe a certain mass murderer in norway , he did n't have many , if any , people he shared his views with locally . 
  but online he had a global `` community '' of like-minded . 
  not so much intelligence as ignorance ( willful or otherwise ) of foreign affairs . 
  this because living in the interior states means one have a long way to travel to get a decidedly different view of the world . . 
  these things reminds me of the twin images boingboing presented some years ago . 
  one images showed a us heatmap of diabetes incidents . 
  another showed a similar heatmap of the number of people holding a us passport . 
  these two images were polar opposites . 
  where the diabetes map showed a concentration towards the interior , the passport one showed a concentration along the coasts . 
  i honestly suspect that as you head inland from any of the coasts , ignorance and `` murica , rah , rah , rah '' attitudes will rise . 
  until you hit the epicenter , where you are as far removed from the rest of the world as you can get . 
  err ... 
  there is at least one guy running rampant on / r/norge posting any article he can find with a negative slant towards immigrants . 
  i think he popped up in a thread here once , but quickly backed off when he did n't get a `` positive '' response to his comments . 
  surprise surprise ... 
  and that is all that matters , as norwegian prices will be balanced against norwegian wages . 
  crossing borders plays havoc , because of exchange rates . 
  more like the randian libertarians ... 
  cheap labor ? 
  and yet the common complaint is that norway is such a expensive nation ... 
  not much different from how various churches and cathedrals were built in europe , as away for the big shots to show off their wealth . 
  and in a year or two , norway will try the same and make a even bigger mess of it . 
  sometimes i swear our elected officials have some kind of inferiority complex ... 
  there is also a pile of treaties making it hard for any single nation to go an alternative path to the status quo . 
  a win win i guess . 
  at this point , i would say both international sides have knifes behind their backs . 
  limited diet , limited window for conception , almost like a natural dead end . 
  because it was thatcher/reagan-style free market worshiping that got the whole stinking mess started . 
  but when the stink reached the various governments , they could not admit a mistake and revert the change . 
  so instead they try various forms of `` air freshener '' . 
  netherlands : tax deductible mortgages norway : tax deductible house saving ( that the banks and estate agents just pile a mortgage on top of ) australia : first home owners boost ( that again the banks and agents pile a mortgage on top of ), 
  meaning the free market is a pipe dream , as it will never exist in a pure form . 
  thing is that during the 60s-70s , most of the western nations built housing on the government bill to keep the price in check . 
  but then with thatcherism spreading in one form or other , the housing market was largely deregulated in the belief that the `` free market '' would drive the prices down . 
  what it did instead was create a mostly continuous speculative bubble , where household debt and housing prices have moved in virtual lock step . 
  would not surprise me . 
  all with the likely blessing of the government because the free market solves everything ... 
  similar things happen every year . 
  they come into peoples gardens to get the over-ripe fruits , and then stagger around ... 
  go home russia , you drunk ? 
  indeed . 
  this looks very interesting . 
  better known as europes power plant ? 
  sometimes i look up the spelling on a enlish word , and end up going `` who the hell came up with that ?!, 
  data retention directive , also known as datalagringsdirektivet in norway . 
  time will tell what the outcome will be , tho i guess the current stresses on the eu system is a nice time to test the waters . 
  attention being elsewhere and all that . 
  just wish said veto had been used on a certain other directive . 
  except that norway has bent over backwards to accept eu directives in the fear that if not , eu will pull out of the eea agreement . 
  none . 
  i swear i posted it as a response to something else on this thread . 
  the polticians are , the general population see the nation getting rammed in the collective ass again and again ... 
  as such , it is more about prift margins and long term market predictability . 
  i think the original goes something like `` one man 's terrorist , is another man 's freedom fighter '' . 
  quite fitting indeed . 
  as usual , the ones paying are the ones that have the least . 
  watching international politics all too often seem like watching the playground of a kindergarten ... 
  so in effect the same kind of issue as with the un security council being vetoed into uselessness . 
  whenever i hear about violations of agreements and treaties , i keep hearing a line from babylon 5 at the back of my head . 
  `` ink on paper !, 
  '' , stated by the centauri head of state right before using illegal weapons in bombardment . 
  so at this point lets just assume nsa has spied on everyone and shut them down for good ? 
  all hail oceania ... 
  in particular the `` a nations economy is that of a household , if you want to buy you need to save if you ca n't borrow '' mantra that right-wingers seems to cling to . 
  correcting myself , the difference was around 58 % . 
  so i tried making a list of what was above that . 
  ** restaurant ** domestic beer ( 75 % ) cappuccino ( 79 % ) ** markets ** rice ( 75 % ) potato ( 75 % ) water ( 133 % ) bottle of wine ( 75 % ) domestic beer ( 148 % ) imported beer ( 65 % ) pack of cigarettes ( 81 % ) ** transports ** taxi 1km ( 80 % ) ** utilities ** basic ( 63 % ) ** rent pr month ** apartment ( 3 bedrooms ) in city center ( 75 % ) seems like my initial assessment holds up , tho certain market items really makes me scratch my head ...
