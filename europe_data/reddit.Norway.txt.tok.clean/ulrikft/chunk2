  how quaint . 
  you do not represent _ my _ european values for sure . 
  there are several ranges in and by cph , but the one i 'm talking about is a rather large , commercial range with a large number of different shooting ranges for shotguns , rifles , handguns etc. 
  that is somewhat similar to norway where you have to have a safety class and be a regular shooter for some time before application . 
  and while hunting guns outnumber pistols/handguns , there is quite a few handguns too . 
  i would say that is a relatively large number . 
  i sometimes shoot at the range just outside cph , and there is always lots of activity when i 'm there , also on the dedicated handgun ranges . 
  well , both yes and no , pistol shooting is a relatively normal hobby in finland , denmark and norway ( and to a certain extent in sweden , though more complicated/bureaucratic , so we have decided to leave sweden out of our yearly akademisk skytterstevne ) . 
   at least i am , yes . 
  there 's literally nothing that gets through their hands these days . 
  that is plainly wrong , both on a national and an european level , legislation , recommendations , regulations and other soft or hard law instruments are enacted all the time . 
  sometimes swiftly , other times slowly , but `` literally nothing '' is just plain wrong . 
   democracy is such a buzzword these days . 
  what is this democracy ? 
  our head of state is determined by birth , and our parliament does not have members that represent me , nor do they listen to what i say . 
  if you think that democracy means that _ your _ personal voice gets a veto , i 'm not sure how to approach the issue ... 
   the overall statistics are not the only relevant ones though . 
  the overall decrease in violence could essentially mean the swedes are really peaceful and every single violent attack is done by immigrants . 
  i would still call that a big fucking problem tbh . 
  i 'm obviously aware that it is n't like that but overall violence statistics would hide such a thing completely . 
  well , yes and no . 
  if immigrants constitutes a disproportionate part of crime statistics , that is a problem in and of itself , and a problem that overall statistics would n't show . 
  but the post i was commenting on was talking about a crisis in society , which i believe can not be substantiated by looking at the overall statistics . 
   the most important statistic ( imo ) is violence within certain `` groups '' of the population . 
  if a certain group ( whether based on religion , nationality , culture or whatever ) is way more violent of course it 's a problem regardless of the overall violence trend . 
  why should the swedes ( or anyone else ) accept that kind of behavior from people they 're actively trying to help ? 
  well , people that have grown up in/experienced war , famine , persecution etc. 
  will necessarily have problems with ptsd or similar issues , that may ( or may not ) lead to an increase in unwanted behavior . 
  that is a given . 
  excluding those that need the help the _ most _ because they need it the most seem counter productive and undermines the entire institute of asylum for refugees . 
   the fact that your average swede is very non-violent is great but my guess is those statistics would be hell of a lot better if you actually divided people into religious groups , native nationality groups etc. 
  that report would be interesting to see but apparently they do n't like looking at touchy stuff over there . 
  : / well , there has been a few studies on that topic , which among other things ( according to wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_and_crime#sweden ) states the following :  in a study by the swedish national council for crime prevention in 1997-2001 , 25 % of the almost 1,520,000 offences were found to be committed by people born abroad , while almost 20 % were committed by swedish-born people with a foreign background . 
  in the study , immigrants were found to be four times more likely to be investigated for lethal violence and robbery than ethnic swedes . 
  but they also state that :  a study of the gap in registered crime between the children of immigrants and the children of native swedes found that `` for males , we are able to explain between half and three-quarters of the gap in crime by reference to parental socio-economic resources and neighbourhood segregation . 
  for females , we can explain even more , sometimes the entire gap . '', 
  the authors furthermore found `` that culture is unlikely to be a strong cause of crime among immigrants '' . 
  if you in addition look at mental health issues relating to conflict , persecution etc , the picture is n't as bleak as you suspected . 
  the key seems to be a ) to ensure socio economic mobility and b ) the necessary mental health care offers . 
  statistics _ are _ more important , because they show the overall picture and makes it easier for us to avoid basing policy decisions/opinions on emotional responses to single cases . 
  there has been a yearly 10 % reduction in violent crime resulting in deaths in sweden since the 90s . 
  this clearly indicates tht there is no `` problem at our hands '' as the account above states . 
  it is a manufactured crisis used for ( rather brown ) political means . 
  not in any way better than when the swedish police hide violent crimes . 
  ( http://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f180006972/2008_23_brottsuvecklingen.pdf - page 60-61 ), 
  so your impression is that crime is on the rise in sweden ? 
  what statistics do you base that on ? 
   i disagree . 
  it is worth looking at the impact of direct democracy on switzerland as a whole . 
  things are working out incredibly well for them . 
  as to iceland 's referendum on bailing out the banks , once again i think the icelandic people made the correct decision . 
  things are working out incredibly well for switzerland because they have lots of nazi gold , is a amoral tax haven and other similar issues , not because they have a direct democracy . 
   in both cases , the majority is preventing the minority from the minority doing what it wants . 
  the majority is preventing the minority from doing what it wants in _ one _ of the cases , in the other case , the majority is protecting one very small minority from a larger and more powerful minority . 
  quite different indeed . 
   i 'm not sure if you have ever been to switzerland , but it is well known that on almost every metric they are one of the wealthiest , freeest , happiest most peaceful countries in the world . 
  they have referendums on a whole range of matters regularly . 
  i can not see what the poor outcomes are . 
  http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/racism_one-in-four-swiss-residents-has-xenophobic-attitudes/41271694  you were originally making a case that people in a direct democracy would vote for their mortgages to be cancelled . 
  you example has no bearing on that whatsoever . 
  so you state , i think it perfectly illustrates that the _ filter _ that is representative democracy has quite a few advantages that direct democracy has not . 
   we also get things like the minaret ban in representative democracies . 
  look at the ban on the face veil in france . 
  banning certain cultural or religious buildings is n't really comparable to banning modes of dress , the reasoning behind the veil ban is drastically different and happens in a quite different legal , cultural and social context . 
   in switzerland direct democracy works well . 
  that is your opinion , for sure , ca n't say that it is very well founded ( or ... founded on anything at all so far ) . 
   plucking a single example which gave a result you disagreed with does not really make your case . 
  the situation with minarets in switzerland as a result of that referendum is not an outcome that is wildly different from the types of policies which representative government comes up with i `` plucked '' a single example that shows that minority protection is weakened by direct democracy . 
  it is as such _ very _ relevant . 
  not sure how that is an argument really . 
  ask the swiss how their minaret-referendrum went . 
  i suspect you expect wrong . 
  we are , however , a part of the eea - so the skepticism about job losses if we were to become a full member is unfounded . 
  we would be able to actually vote on issues , that would be nice . . 
  this is what you stated :  you were saying that you can be a femenist but not a mensrightactivist as a reply to a post where i _ explicitly _ explain why that is wrong , referencing the original post where i state that men do face problems , but that many of those stem from the traditional gender roles that feminists fight ( and get ridiculed by the likes of you for fighting ) . 
  do you not understand how _ extremely _ weak that is ? 
  how self defeating that is ? 
  you do not actually address my point at all . 
  you _ invent _ a viewpoint i do not have , then you bash that view-point in angry and rather childish tones ( hence the `` kid '' - remark , few people grow up keeping the belief that screaming enough invective is efficient rhetoric ) . 
  that is _ literally _ the definition of a straw man argument . 
  please _ do _ address my _ actual _ points , but i guess you 'll live up to the swedish stereotype - by keeping up the stupid troll act . 
   you were saying that you can be a femenist but not a mensrightactivist not really , no . 
   thats fucking ignorant , just because someone else have problems do not take away your own problems . 
  its the same thing as saying `` people are dying in the middle east so you have no excuse to be sad '' . 
  its pretty disgusting . 
  nice straw man , i guess you privileged kids have a lot of time today . 
  you claim that my opinion is that only women can be discriminated against , as a reply to the post where i among other things mention male problems stemming from gender role issues . 
  it is _ beyond _ ignorant , and is _ obviously _ willful trolling . 
  you can not honestly claim to be arguing in good faith . 
  and that is why i 'll ignore your infantile posts from now . 
  go ahead , get the last word in , i know your type , you ca n't live without it . 
   so only women can be discriminated against and disadvantaged . 
  i see . 
  infantile straw men like this is why i ca n't take your kind seriously . 
  this was the top voted comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights/comments/3or2ge/stephen_fry_quits_as_host_of_the_bbc_show_qiand/cvzvqvj thank you for showing me that you are dishonest and untrustworthy . 
  i 'll just ignore you from now on . 
  is this sensible ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights/comments/3or2ge/stephen_fry_quits_as_host_of_the_bbc_show_qiand/ the content , the comments and the attitude that permeates that sub is toxic . 
  as i suspected . 
  so you wo n't document your claims ?
