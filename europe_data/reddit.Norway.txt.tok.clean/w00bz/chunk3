  in this situation i dont see the utility of that , but i do n't see any harm either . 
  no , i think this case is a reflection of the lack of professionalism in the tabloids . 
  from what i have read and seen in the original article , the minister made no claims that the rescue demostration gave her an impression of what it is like to be a refugee . 
  on the contrary she states directly after getting on board that getting picked up in a boat after a quck dip in a survival suit is in no way indicative of how it must be to actually be in a emergecy situation as a refugee , and that the strain that boatrefugees has to suffer is unimaginable . 
  the demonstration was the initiative of the organisation in charge of the vessel . 
  they have confirmed this themselves . 
  it seems that today , the media is not simply reporting the news but creating the news as well . 
  this excercise in stupidity was well aided by short sighted political activists shouting `` wolf , wolf '' and distorting the actual facts on social media . 
  i ca n't believe i am actually defending this political party ( though i agree to some extent with their views on immigration policy , but little else ) . 
  they have done some really dumb shit in the past , but in this case it seems entirely unfair .

  im guessing there are certain policies you are thinking of . . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_indonesia on the other hand , you seem to be right about muslim albanians . 
  the benefit of a nato membership is access to infrastructure and logistics in europe , shared intelligence and military support in conflicts where nato article 5 comes into play . 
  what does a nato membership cost the us ? 
  the utility of the alliance is difficult to judge untill it is actually needed . 
  a europe out of nato is as far as i can understand from us geopolitical reasoning , a europe that in the long term could form closer ties to russia and become not just a regional hegemon , but a peer competitor to the us as a global power . 
  for europe , the presense of the usa in nato , ensures that russian agression is out of the picture ( beyond a shadow of a doubt ) . 
  it also removes the need for the rest of the alliance to keep and maintain a nuclear arsenal . 
  i think that is an excellent arrangement that prevent nuclear proliferation and reduces the chance of terrible fuckups . 
  in terms of military budgets i dont think us military spending would be less if europe was not part of nato . 
  it would probably be higher , not just to cover the military capability europe currently provides but also as a deterrence against europe if diplomatic relations between us go to shit . 
  european defense spending would be atleast 2 % in very short time if the us left nato . 
  as for the ukraine war , it shows the internal contradictions of nato for european security . 
  the russian aggression did not appear out of thin air . 
  instead of writing a wall of text ill link someone that makes the argument much better than i can : stratfor on russias geographical challenges : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6lihngsqoc john j. mearsheimer on the ukraine conflict : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrmisqagos4 as for the security of ukraine , they are getting fucked by everyone . 
  nato and the us fucked them by trying to move them into a defence/economic relationship . 
  the lesson from the georiga conflict was that russia would not accept nato on their borders , and that nato would/could not back the invitation extended to georgia of closer military cooperation with actual military force . 
  we whent ahead with ukraine anyways . 
  ukraine fucked themselves by going along with it - should have taken a note from the georgia incident . 
  russia is both fucking itself and ukraine . 
  economic sanctions and increased military spending is the last thing russia needs with the current oil and gas prices . 
  they are getting quagmired in , and wrecking ukraine , and in most of the cases only capturing rubble and economic obligations . 
  we will not arm ukraine with the weapons they need to win engagements - for example capable atgms . 
  if russia gets pressured too much we risk desperate tactical nukes getting on the table ( then all bets are off ) . 
  '' * during the nato summit in bucharest in april 2008 , american president george w. bush lobbied for offering a membership action plan ( map ) to georgia and ukraine . 
  however , germany and france said that offering map to ukraine and georgia would be `` an unnecessary offence '' to russia . 
  [ 72 ] nato stated that ukraine and georgia would become members of the alliance and pledged to review the applications for map in december 2008 . 
  [ 73 ] russian president vladimir putin was in bucharest during the summit . 
  at the end of the summit on 4 april , putin said that expansion of nato to russia 's borders `` would be taken in russia as a direct threat to the security of our country '' . 
  [ 74 ] after the bucharest summit , russia became more aggressive and began to actively prepare for the invasion of georgia . 
  [ 75 ] * '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war#relations_between_georgia_and_the_west im guessing washington wants to dominate russia more by creeping nato up on its borders . 
  europe wants peace and quiet . 
  thus as a partner you are both a security boon and a liability . 
  the fact that nato ended up stating that : '' * ukraine and georgia would become members of the alliance and pledged to review the applications for map in december 2008 . 
  * '' tells a lot about the balance of influence between europe and the us within nato . 
  lets just say that like with the military spending , there is an inbalance . 
  i will round this part of the argument with this article : http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/stephen-glain/2011/06/30/washington-needs-nato-more-than-nato-needs-washington as for running the world i admit its an exaggeration , but not a large one : the 865 base sites on foreign soil : http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/mapping-u-s-foreign-military-bases regime changes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_involvement_in_regime_change covert regime changes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_policy_of_the_united_states#covert_actions timeline of us military operations : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_united_states_military_operations military budget comparison : http://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison  let 's say some country in the middle east decides that it is interested in taking over a large chunk of the middle east 's oil supply . 
  yes , its nice with cheap oil . 
  the powerplays to keep the middle east divided has been ugly though : the cia and bp coup eventually got the religious nut-jobs in power in iran . 
  supporting the jihadists in afghanistan was shitty and backfired badly . 
  there are few i despise as much as the saudis , and they would have no power without the us . 
  playing the iraqies against the iranians was ugly . 
  the region is now a humanitarian trainwreck partially due to western geopolitics . 
   it is not possible any more to scale up military capabilities meaningfully simply on-demand by conscripting a bunch of riflemen -- a country ca n't say `` oh , i 'd like a military now ... i 'll just increase spending so that next year i 'll be at par '' . 
  it 's something that requires maintaining an industry to support a military and to keep a wide range of specialists familiar with complex systems . 
  umm , i completely agree ? 
  i 'd also like to qoute james m. goldgeier , dean of the school of international service at american university in washington , from your article : '' ( he ) thinks that nato has some considerable soul-searching ahead if its european members become increasingly unwilling to operate abroad . 
  `` if nato is n't outward looking , it 's got nothing to do , '' he said . 
  `` it ca n't go back to managing a threat from russia , because it 's not a real threat . '' what the us pays for in military spending is not national defence . 
  you live on a continent with nothing remotely resembeling a peer competitor . 
  the us pays to be global or near global hegemon . 
  the return on that investment is great influence and considerable diplomatic leverage . 
  leverage as in `` we can topple your regime at will , if you defy our interests '' . 
  the enthusiasm for running the world has greatly subsided in europe since world war 2 , and especially after the collapse of the soviet union . 
  only france and england seem remotely interested today . 
  its just frustrating to hear americans talk of nato as if the military capasity you contribute with to nato is some sort of charity for the rest of us . 
  you pay for hard power to reach your foreign policy objectives . 
  that being said , it would probably be for the better if europe upped the ante , though i think the big gains in military capacity lie in a singular european army , not incremental increases in military spending . 
  in the current climate thats not happening though , i 'd be suprised if the eu even survives as an political entity . 
  `` in september 2014 , nato 's heads of state and government agreed at the wales summit to make an obligation out of what hitherto had only been a recommendation : to spend 2 % of their gdp on defence .
