  in short , i saw none of the famed * facts * you speak ok . 
  soo ... just butthurt ? 
  * sorry , just had too  *, 
  i guess its uncomfortable looking outside the bubble where `` we good , they bad '' . 
  `` we have always been at war with eastasia . 
   but instead he seems to have some sort of personal vendetta against the clintons and seems to see the leaks not as a journalistic goal but as the means by which he aims to destroy the clinton campaign . 
  considering he probably does not feel to happy about his dnc whistleblowers death ( yet another death in the vicinity of the clintons and all . . ) , i can kind of see why he might feel the need for some retribution ? 
  like i said , the issue is more complex then your initial post . 
  i see here you are pointing a bit into one of the levels of complexity : much of the `` vitriol '' spewed by politicians are primarily for the local electorate/voter base/populace . 
  even if directed towards another country , the prime objective of such statements are not foreign , but local , policies or goals . 
   the thing is , issues in western europe are easy to exploit . 
  the whole view of outside world in russian federation is built among ` siege mentality ' . 
  nearly ever virtue that is praised in europe , from general democracy to minority rights to social issues are turned against very countries . 
  expat girl is only one example , the picture created and designed to consume for expats or local populace of target country is the picture that groups of russian people with russian heritage and `` russian values '' are not safe . 
  they are not safe because they will get raped by refugees , they are not safe because children will be corrupted by sexual imagery , they are not safe because their language and their rights are at danger , they are not safe because they are hostages in corrupt eu structure . 
  not knowing the rape statistics of russia , nor having any real insight into how rampant crime is , nor what type of crimes are common etc , i cant really comment on that . 
  what i can say though , and this is from a scandinavian living in eastern europe , that sexual and violent crime here is at least less prevalent then `` back home '' . 
  and that is not a joke . 
  so , some fear , or rather healthy concerns on such matters does not in my view indicate paranoia . 
  do you think an event such as that in cologne could even happen downtown moscow ? 
  1000 + refugees mayhem against police , sexual assaults rampant etc ? 
  i dont think the russians would allow that event to ever escalate , and the response would most likely be much quicker ( and harsher : already a few sentences have been made , no one has so far been sent to jail even ) . 
   it 's normal to be critical of issues that are sensitive and important , but on nearly every level most of the european countries surpass russia in their rights which are provided to their citizens , surpassing living standards and in areas such as freedom of speech etc. 
  it is the very reason that russians abroad and russians within russian federation are fed scary rhetoric on decadent and rotten outside world and it 's to a degree a justification why russian federation lags behind most of the countries in europe , because they are not capable to provide such degree of freedom and wealth to its citizens . 
  while european countries are and can be self-critical , very virtues and every opportunity is exploited and turned against europeans . 
  this is the main difference between debates we have and information which is designed to inflame target group . 
  here you are doing a rather classic mistake though . 
  listen , i am not naive about putin and his methods , i 've never developed a taste for polonium in my tea for instance  but : saying that russias critique against european politicians for their hypocrisy ( `` we have free speech . 
  now lets hire an ex-stasi agent to hunt down and arrest/prosecute anyone saying things we dont like on social media . '' ), 
  is invalid because it is russia doing so is simply a case of `` shooting the messenger '' . 
  is there a level of hypocrisy from russian side when they do so ? 
  not necessarily , although probable ( i 'd say that really can only be determined on a case-by-case basis ) . 
  more importantly : it is * our * politicians claiming t uphold these values and virtues , yet it is also * the very same * politicians that time and time again show their true colors - and thus hypocrisy . 
   it is also a case that everything of great importance or anything of little relevance are used against countries within europe . 
  norway for example , are notorious for `` stealing children '' from expats . 
  the amount of pure propaganda which were spewed by pro-kremlin people are astonishing , and it 's quite unsurprising that many people when norway is mentioned , there 's barnevernet mentioned . 
  and image of norway is not that of wealthy respectable country , but that of corrupt country which takes children away . 
  if you dont think the issues related to barnevernet are also of great concern , and quite a few scandals so far already , also in norway and norwegian families you are sadly mistaken . 
  they truly deserve to be publicly shamed for quite a few of their actions . 
  so , i , as a norwegian myself , have no problem understanding those sentiments . 
   media plays huge role in every case , and while sensationalism is what earning bread for many european outlets , for russia media is tool inseparable of state . 
  imagine what would happened and headlines that would been published by kremlin media if child was to be beheaded by muslim woman in capital of major european county , and head of the child would been paraded by the women in the light of the day ? 
  it was quite surprising to hear kremlin apologists and apologetics how initial reports were censored because of fear of igniting tensions within russian federation . 
  it 's quite surprising the mental gymnastics when it comes to using amnesty as a source when it comes to criticizing west , and how amnesty is laughed of and stated to be factually wrong when it comes to negative claims concerning rf and its actions abroad . 
  the media here may not be outright in the pockets of politicians , but considering how their role has evolved over the last 60 + years from `` informing the public '' to `` guiding the public '' ( also known as agenda journalism ) , they are , or should , be considered a part in the political process , with their own interests and agendas . 
  to think that is somehow better or different then outright state ownership is i believe almost a question of semantics these days . 
  its the same money owning the media that lobbies the politicians after all . .  great deal of problem is that information within russia is circulating differently . 
  while sputnik , rt are designed for western consumption , for domestic consumption stories and propaganda are even more vile . 
  i can only imagine the outrage of russian people and politicians if anchor of bbc would do a report on how us would make russian federation a nuclear wasteland . 
  cant really comment much on this . 
  probably correct as you say . 
  i will add though that , as i made a point of in my initial post on the matter , fbi/cnn/bbc and pretty much `` everyone '' said russia hacked dnc `` to hurt poor innocent hillary '' . 
  this was truly a nice touch , allowing the discussion to focus on why/how russia did this , link `` evil '' trump to putin ( the boogeyman ) , and ** not ** talk about the actual contents of the emails . 
  in short : hillary walks free ( again ) . 
  now , assange has pretty much confirmed after the death of a dnc employee , that he was a/the dnc whistleblower . 
  yet , our `` unbiased '' media keep talking like it was putin himself in person who hacked the dnc ... then you have stories like this : [ s has trained only ` four or five ' syrian fighters against isis , top general testifies ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/16/us-military-syrian-isis-fighters ) there are thousands of incredolous stories like this , verified and true , about how `` our '' side is operating ... 
  i mean , seriously ? 
  are we supposed to believe anything any of our politicians and leaders are telling us ? 
  also want to add : after snowdens nsa reveals , the sheer gall to even try and appear hurt over this , even if it was true , is just mind boggling . .  most complex issue when it comes to informational warfare * is the compatibility of free speech and censorship . 
  this is the key factor which is exploited by rf . 
  for russia it 's very easy to point at target country and state that freedom of information is an illusion and country is corrupted by propaganda , because censoring certain channels or certain outlets contradicts statements that very country is free and `` better '' than russia . 
  this is the strength of russian federation . 
  it does not require to check itself on transparency , while anything and everything is questioned in europe , and hypocritical europe can not be , for europe being hypocritical is rehabilitation of russia on basis that we all are the same , we are only are on the wrong side of this ( real or imaginary ) conflict . 
  see above . 
  the hypocrisy on one side does not excuse the other . 
  in particularly not when the other side is the one shouting how much they support freedom . 
  how can you see when a politican is lying ? 
  his lips are moving . 
  so true . 
  i have a personal preference for the old joke : `` q : how do you know when a politician is lying ? 
  a : his lips are moving . '', 
  not going to argue your points , although i will comment that i think they are a bit simplistic . 
  not saying you are wrong per se , but i think the picture is a bit more complex then so . 
  ps : germany : dont think they needed the outrage of single russian girl to create issues , considering the whole cologne debacle . . and thats just for starters . . 
   i 'm just puzzled how you can say that , when there 's a thread right alongside this one about senior german meps pushing to punish hungary and poland for resisting the quota , posted by you no less . 
  ouch , 
  well , another question could also be asked in the same spirit : why are the sheeps so susceptible to eu/us propaganda ? 
  * because surely you dont believe `` our '' side is ** not ** engaged in propaganda ? 
  edit : wow , downvotes ? 
  you guys really dont believe our politicians are ever engaged in propaganda directed towards us ? 
  lets face it , eu/us is not exactly making it difficult for them - they sure as hell dont need to resort to disinformation to make people pissed off . 
  the actions of eu and our politicians are galling enough as it is , all they 'd need to do is showing just how corrupt , hypocritical and anti-democratic `` our '' guys are ... on that note , i 'd also like to add that i do take these reports of russian interventions in western information flows with a huge grain of salt . . case in point : in the whole dnc email scandal in the us , everyone and their grandmother have been saying it was `` undoubtedly '' the russians . . 
  yet just a few days back , assange himself pretty much confirmed that the death of a dnc employee was indeed the death of a/the whistleblower . . 
  someone has a vested interest in painting a threatening picture of russia , and although i 'm sure russia is no saint in all of this , to take the boogeyman accusations from `` our '' less then pristine guys is just not in the cards ... 
  successful immigrant in poland here . 
  can confirm . 
  would immigrate again . 
  the story was first told by the mirror a few days back , but was rejected here due to the source not being approved . 
  not sure of the veracity of this , found it by accident more or less . 
  but curious of course . 
  actually , i expect , considering msms and our establishments track record to avoid at all costs to mention any link to isis . 
  i think the list includes a few more choice descriptions : 1 . 
  mentally ill - currently # 1 go-to description this last month 2 . 
  lone wolf - preferably followed by a series of arrests the following weeks 3 . 
  non-religious man - followed by surprise story of how he/they got radicalized `` instantly '' 4 . 
  unknown motive, 
  i was otherwise betting on mentally ill , no known religious affiliation and most certainly alone , lone wolf one could even say, 
  lone wolf, 
  unknown motive, 
  does anyone even believe if only for a second when they read about these attacks the establishments claims of `` lone wolf '' , `` mentally ill '' , `` unknown motive '' ?
