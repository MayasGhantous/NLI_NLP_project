  i do n't know how someone could have felt offended by that joke . 
  i watched that episode and it was obvious irony for me . 
  i remember colbert making a joke about polish submarines having mosquito nets and i did n't feel offended though i 'm polish . 
  you just need to have some distance to stuff , slovakia . 
  they were found in the same ditch though ? 
  hope they do n't start using camels if things get out of hand, 
  and the pm of latvia was responsible ? 
  he probably built that hall with his bare hands . 
  wow . 
  i wounder what would he do if a plane with 86 people aboard including the president would crash in russia . 
  our did n't give a f ** k, 
  relating everything bad that is happening to smolensk , kaczynski and pis is becoming pathetic . 
  what do we need tanks for ? 
  we could build hundreds of cute rainbows across poland for that money . 
  you just wish you could refer to europe as germany , do n't you ? 
  what homophobia ? 
  we just hate them frickin ' rainbows . 
  and stop calling football `` soccer '' !, 
  is n't your next match against poland ? 
  if yes - no need to worry , you ca n't lose that , 
  well actually it did n't take me that long ... 
  poland * some guys [ burned down a rainbow ] ( http://www.redditpics.com/polish-extreme-nationalists-celebrate-the-burning,2188188 ) , causing a ridiculous amount of butthurtedness in the media, 
  i could give away my citizenship for that amount of cash !, 
  any takers ? 
  * their tanks can only go backwards * they like wine and invented the blowjob * the louvre is full of expensive shit ( most of which is stolen ) * do n't like the english language very much . 
  well , i know what i saw , maybe not necessarily believing statistics might be thoughtcrime ( please do n't denounce me ) . 
  let 's say they have a degree . 
  that does n't mean they 're educated , it just means they have a degree . 
  it might as well be some bs degree like political sciences . 
  what sort of an education is that ? 
  if they really had a solid education , they could easily make a good living in poland . 
  no , to my personal experience . 
  i speak from experience , i was abroad some time ago , and i did n't meet any `` university educated '' people from poland . 
  mostly thieves , criminals , drunks , sluts and people who have to pay alimony . 
  a polish university education means nothing and proves nothing, 
  well , it 's difficult to say how many , but according to a 2011 census , a little over 2 milion poles are living abroad permanently . 
  i think this number is actually bigger . 
  with high unemployment even now , their return would make it even higher . 
  a lot of poor , unemployed people is likely to create a very tense situation . 
  obviously worse than syria is an exaggeration , it would probably be more like greece , 
  hahahahaha , yes , the young , educated glamorous boys and girls and boygirls and girlboys from big cities drinking their frappucinos and taking selfies with their iphones would be attacked by the backwards eurosceptic idiots who still believe in god and family and marriage etc. 
  but wait !, 
  are n't emigrants usually uneducated men and women who have a bastard child because they were too stupid to use a condom and now have to wash dishes to make a living ? 
  if the people who emigrated were to come back , poland would probably be worse than syria, 
  * second most commonly spoken language in the world ( trying to learn it myself and enjoy it ) , * seem to have some sort of problem with bulls , * everyone is like ` omg real madrid is so gay , visca el barca ' ( or the other way around ) , i do n't understand why , * really nice climate , unlike fucking poland , which is freezing cold most of the time , * cheap cigarettes ? , * having some economic problems , * had a civil war before ww2 , * catalonia is trying to secede from them , * they have a preety sweet church which has been in construction for a long time * noone expects the spanish inquisition, 
  just like you have american english , and the british variation sounds snobby to you , does n't it ? 
  come on , you 'll soon be under all that water , we 're just saving those nice bikes of yours !, 
  i think that 's a german thing . 
  we just grow and sell it to them . 
  i bet that somewhere * some polish guys stole your bikes, 
   some idiot walked into la 's airport ( lax ) and started firing a semiautomatic weapon . 
  he killed a tsa agent and wounded some other people before being shot and subdued . 
  turns out he 's just some 23-year old crazy guy with a machine gun . 
  why do you still care ? 
  does n't it happen on a regular basis that there 's a public shooting in your shitkicker cowboy country ? 
  hitler and the nsdap were shot at too ... occupational hazard, 
  poor guy, 
  probably one of the best cuisines in the world . 
  very , very impressing history and cultural heritage . 
  kind of not what it used to be , i suppose . 
  who did n't they spy on ? 
  they even spy on fu ** ing martians , if they exist . 
  during a storm , do you hide in your houses or your volvos ? 
  i 've been there a year , worked with mostly poles in a storage facility of one of the biggest supermarkets . 
  of all the poles working there ( let 's say 50 , not sure how many exactly ) i knew just one who ` kind of ' spoke dutch i.e. 
  he knew some words and phrases . 
  but it gets better . 
  most of the poles did n't even know english , their only language being polish . 
  remember one guy trying to communicate through drawings ( he wanted to go home , so he drew a stick figura , an arrow and a building ) , which was very cute . 
  thievery , narcotics , stupidity - these are the three main characteristics i would apply to most of the polish crowd working there . 
  earning money, 
  final solution of the dog problem, 
  we would ask our friend america for help , 
  in poland we have something much funnier . 
  it 's called a church fund , and through it , the government gives away money to the church . 
  here are the sums we have been giving away since the fall of communism : 1990 -- 2 000 000 ( 2 110 071 ) [ 3 ] 1991 -- 4 656 000 ( 4 459 747 ) [ 3 ] 1992 -- 7 800 000 ( 7 932 900 ) [ 3 ] 1993 -- 9 360 000 ( 9 474 400 ) [ 3 ] 1994 -- 11\u00a0000\u00a0000 ( 11\u00a0127\u00a0109 ) [ 3 ] 1995 -- 15\u00a0000\u00a0000 ( 15\u00a0122\u00a0318 ) [ 3 ] 1996 -- 22\u00a0100\u00a0000 ( 22\u00a0376\u00a0247 ) [ 3 ] 1997 -- 25\u00a0400\u00a0000 ( 25\u00a0400\u00a0000 ) [ 3 ] 1998 -- 28\u00a0579\u00a0000 ( 28\u00a0579\u00a0000 ) [ 3 ] 1999 -- 36\u00a0778\u00a0000 ( 36\u00a0778\u00a0000 ) [ 3 ] 2000 -- 67\u00a0834\u00a0000 ( 67\u00a0834\u00a0000 ) [ 3 ] 2001 -- 132\u00a0280\u00a0000 ( 132\u00a0280\u00a0000 ) [ 3 ] 2002 -- 75\u00a0719\u00a0000 ( 75\u00a0719\u00a0000 ) [ 3 ] 2003 -- 78\u00a0333\u00a0000 ( 78\u00a0333\u00a0000 ) ( 0,04 % of all expenses ) [ 3 ] 2004 -- 78\u00a0333\u00a0000 ( 78\u00a0333\u00a0000 ) [ 3 ] 2008 -- 97\u00a0908\u00a0000 [ 4 ] 2009 -- 95\u00a0929\u00a0000 [ 5 ] 2010 -- 86\u00a0336\u00a0000 [ 5 ] 2011 - 89\u00a0000\u00a0000 [ 6 ] 2012 - 94\u00a0374\u00a0000 [ 7 ] 2013 - 94\u00a0374\u00a0000 [ 8 ] + the church does n't have to pay taxes from what they gather . 
  it 's a really good business , being a priest in poland . 
  spain ? 
  steamboat ? 
  bollocks . 
  everyone knows santa lives in america and drives a coca-cola truck , duh . 
  edit . 
  though the part with the black helper could point to america . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification#poland_and_lithuania you call this education ? 
  well , perhaps we had a problem with education because poland had just become an independent nation . 
  recently being under russian occupation ( among others ) . 
  that might have had created a problem with education , since all of the invaders tried to make polish people speak german/russian rather than polish . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification#poland_and_lithuania http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanisation_of_poles_during_the_partitions, 
  now dutch people will have to tell their children - santa went to jail for being racist . 
  that is certainly going to be a difficult conversation . 
  hitler did bad things , of course , a lot of people did bad things during wwii . 
  europe was full of crazy dictators during that time and the situation was quite tense . 
  most of europe , including poland , was preparing for war and it was probably a matter of who throws the stone first and if it had n't been the nazis , it would have been someone else . 
  ironically , i think the russian genocide was much more calculated for breaking the spirit of poles and degrading the population for a long period of time , since it mostly targeted inteligencia , while the germans were mostly concerned with ... we all know who . 
  and most of all , the russians ' attack on germany had nothing to do with liberating poland , it was rather an opportunity to make poland a vassal state of russia before the allies got there . 
  the russians were just a horde of mindless , bloodthirsty savages who raped and killed whatever and whoever they came across , ran children over with tanks etc. 
  for no particular reason . 
  they fought for no idea , having nothing to lose , since they knew that if they did n't die on the battlefield , stalin would kill them anyway . 
  and if they 're at it , why not have some fun . 
  i think the commonwealth should be re-established .
