  the phrase `` opium des volkes '' was n't coined by marx tho . 
   he did not support slavery he did n't ? 
  oops . 
  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/slavery_in_the_bible#slavery_in_the_new_testament ___ the new testament makes no condemnation of slavery and does no more than admonish slaves to be obedient and their masters not to be unfair . 
  paul , or whoever wrote the epistles , at no time suggested there was anything wrong with slavery . 
  one could speculate that this might have been because he wanted to avoid upsetting the many slave owners in the early christian congregations or to keep on good political terms with the roman government . 
  or , more probably , he simply thought slavery was an acceptable fact of life as did practically everyone else at the time . 
  ephesians 6:5 -8 ( nasb ) : 5slaves , be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in the sincerity of your heart , as to christ ; 6not by way of eyeservice , as men-pleasers , but as slaves of christ , doing the will of god from the heart . 
  7with good will render service , as to the lord , and not to men , 8knowing that whatever good thing each one does , this he will receive back from the lord , whether slave or free . 
  christian slaves were told to obey their masters `` for the sake of the cause '' and be especially obedient to christian masters : 1 timothy 6:1 -2 ( nasb ) : 1all who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of god and our doctrine will not be spoken against . 
  2those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren , but must serve them all the more , because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved . 
  teach and preach these principles . 
  there are instructions for christian slave owners to treat their slaves well . 
  ephesians 6:9 ( nasb ) : 9and masters , do the same things to them , and give up threatening , knowing that both their master and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with him . 
  colossians 4:1 ( nasb ) 1masters , grant to your slaves justice and fairness , knowing that you too have a master in heaven . 
  [ 6 ] one passage often cited by apologists as supposed evidence for new testament condemnation of slavery is 1 timothy 1:10 . 
  however , as the king james version accurately translates , this condemnation is of `` men stealers '' ( greek : andrapodistais ) , [ 7 ] i.e. 
  slave raiders who kidnapped and sold people as slaves , not slave traders or slave holders in general . 
  so paul only singled out slave raiders to be considered `` lawless and rebellious , '' and to be categorized with murderers , homosexuals , liars and oath breakers . 
  the rather bland admonishment to slave masters by paul is more than balanced by the demands for absolute obedience made of slaves . 
  it is also rather telling that the masters are likened to god and jesus , while the masters are simply told that they have a higher lord . 
  so much for jesus as the embodiment of the underdog - paul could have pointed to jesus ' imprisonment and death as a cautionary tale to slave masters that even humble ( d ) characters can be important . 
  [ 8 ] before the apologist plays the `` but jesus did n't condone slavery '' - card , following all these pauline examples , try reading matthew 18:25 , where jesus uses slaves in a parable and has no qualms about recommending that not only a slave but also his wife and family be sold , while in other parables jesus recommends that disobedient slaves should be beaten ( luke 12:47 ) or even killed ( matthew 24:51 ) .
