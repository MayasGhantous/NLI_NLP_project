  we thought no one can be worse than dubya . 
  america : always performing better than expected . 
  that 's not music . 
  what music ? 
  haendel was german , you 're left only with dowland . 
  this is how i feel about the polish system . 
  we do n't need tens of thousands of sociologists , who graduated at `` universities '' in cities many poles ca n't find on a map . 
  fun fact : the boundaries of the blue area are the former boundaries of russia and austro-hungary . 
  depends on how you define it . 
  villach is so super liberal compared to where i 'm from . 
  austria is comfy as hell . 
  do n't elect h ... er , though . 
  and could you get rid of mozart ? 
  replace him with beethoven or even biber ? 
  would be very positive , if it were n't for the attitude towards english . 
  wd\u017b was introduced in 2009 . 
  nah , i like listening to renaissance chamber music with a translation in my hand . 
  but i did n't attend for most of the time - it was the last lesson , so i asked my parents to let me go home . 
  broken german . 
  i want to learn italian , 'cause i love * opere * and italian renaissance music . 
  it 's more popular in ukraine tho . 
  i can take up to ~ 10 ^ 6 . 
  i know a guy who has 200 m to ukraine . 
  can confirm ee is islamophobic . 
  i know way too many intolerant people . 
  thankfully , not at all . 
  the ruling party . 
   indians get to claim india , nigerians nigeria there 's more diversity in nigeria than in whole europe . 
  to give you the idea , the major sex-ed textbook is pro-abstinence , anti-abortion , anti-hormonal contraception . 
  the sources it cites would be hilarious , if it were n't true . 
  for example : a fragment of `` sunday '' about so-called `` post-abortion syndrome '' . 
  i 've once heard on civics from the fucking teacher that the causes of homosexuality are sects and rich `` sponsors '' . 
  nah , we 're 100000 % tru slav \u2122 \u00ae , it 's you that are italian . 
  you need n't tell me how christian poland is . 
  i live here , and the dumb shit people say or do is unbelievable . 
  do you understand the meaning of the word `` most '' ? 
  polish and slovene are one of the least similar slavic languages . 
   racism - the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race , ** especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races . 
  **  we want our race to be # 1,

  also , how do you define young ? 
  what about immigrants from ukraine ? 
   once they start legitimizing this replacement migration policy , once `` polish '' just becomes a piece of paper , and once they make enough `` documentaries '' about how poland `` benefits '' from mass immigration , it wo n't stop . 
  this will very likely not happen at all . 
  poles are extremly xenophobic , there are places where foreign students are advised not to go alone anywhere , because of traditional polish catholic values and hospitality . 
  poland is n't wealthy , and if i were to immigrate to europe , i would n't choose that shithole , because other countries are simply better , and the polish language is one of the hardest ones in europe . 
   once they start legitimizing this replacement migration policy , once `` polish '' just becomes a piece of paper cathofascists love saying how polish tatars are n't polish , despite having lived here for the last 400 years . 
  not likely to happen . 
   mans of them are not even from war ravaged countries ... 
  yes , they are . 
  most of them are . 
   afganistan is a safe country i would n't call it a safe country . 
  [ the conflict in syria continues to be by far the biggest driver of migration . 
  but the ongoing violence in afghanistan and iraq , abuses in eritrea , as well as poverty in kosovo , are also leading people to look for new lives elsewhere .

  8k roma is 4 % of the population . 
  it 's not like the refugees are in europe to stay . 
  you have much more roma people than you would have muslims . 
  poles are freaking out over a few thousand in *** a 36 mln country *** . 
  there is propably no god/gods .

   essentially the week prior to the championships for the school 's sports teams the whole school comes together to celebrate their school . 
  typically each day of spirit week will have a ` theme ' which varies from school to school . 
  everyone will dress up for those days and paint their faces . 
  common themes include usa/red , white , and blue day , pajama day , blackout day ( everyone wears all black ) , twin day ( you dress up like one of your friends ) , tie-dye day ... you get the point . 
  school is for learning . 
  if i could , i would ban sports from schools . 
  i do n't know . 
  is n't nowa huta the absolute hellhole ?

  * beka\u0107 * means `` to burp '' in polish . 
  \u017eiga\u0107 is a vulgar verb in polish that means `` to puke '' . 
  now do that in the spoken version .
