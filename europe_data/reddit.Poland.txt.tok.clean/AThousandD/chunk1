  the fact that slovakia wants to legally protect itself from being forced to accept refugees makes them more right-wing than the spiritual successor party of the nsdap ?

  what do you mean undust ? 
  you mean to say you do n't keep yours impeccably clean at all times ? 
  oh , do n't be such a seriousness nazi , it was a joke , man !, 
  i understand what you are doing with extending the process beyond the first step , but it 's a mystery to me why you are doing it . 
  let me try this . 
  is building a road automatically bad ? 
  when hitler built roads in the 1930 's was it bad for the people of germany ? 
  the end . 
  are nazis capable of ever having a valid point ? 
  yes . 
  either way , it 's not really about hitler 's highways , we started off with the npd leaflet . 
  here again i stand by my sentiment : npd 's hi-jacking of the soon-to-be-official policies , as suggested elsewhere in this thread , is what 's dangerous ** to someone who does n't know any better ** . 
  the leaflet sounds reasonable , therefore hi-jacking those ideas makes the npd appear as if they have a valid point . 
  so when they 're making it , it 's a valid point . 
  so people will see that leaflet and if you had your way , they 'd look at what many here have said are perfectly reasonable things ( hence , one would assume , why they 're being adopted as the official stance ) and they 'd wonder about how on earth `` those bloody nazis '' ever got that thing so right down to a t - which could make someone like you look like a fool , for having always claimed that nazis are idiots . 
  dangerous people should not be belittled and should not be underestimated . 
  to me , a realistic assessment is a must . 
  ( i am slightly reminded of hannah arendt 's `` banality of evil '' , as portrayed by [ that film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmbsiq1lkoa ) , for some reason , but that 's a tangent ), 
  fair point , i agree . 
  i hurriedly read that as `` accepted in the west '' , instead of `` accepted part of western culture '' . 
  apologies . 
  then we appear to agree in general , but one of us might be getting something wrong , it appears ? 
  i stand by the sentiment - right-wing extremism is dangerous because in separation some of their viewpoints are valid ; which is what you so vehemently reject , claiming that due to the tainted connection to a larger ideology , right-wing extremism can not ever be right . 
  which to me is an absurd notion to hold , to me - to say right-wing extremism is right about something , but at the same time it 's wrong about the same thing , because it 's right-wing extremism . 
  i hope you catch my drift , as i ca n't think of an analogy suitable enough . 
  to me , that 's a bit of denial and a rejection of reality . 
  sorry , we 'll have to disagree over this detail then , albeit i 'm glad we agree on the general point ( i assume we 're both referring to the statement that right-wing extremism is dangerous , for various reasons and in various meanings of the term ) . 
  i have to ask , however , what you meant by your statement that `` right wingers are espousing a reactionary ideology itself '' ? 
  reactionary as opposed to ... ? 
  but is n't male circumcision accepted in the west ? 
  it 's not controversial to me - i do n't think i know anyone who 's had it done , but i do n't hear about protests against it ( at least it 's absent in the mass media i happen to consult ) . 
  do you mean to say you used the `` suggest title '' reddit function and this was the result ? 
  i realise the plans were conceptualised during the weimar republic . 
  still , i believe hitler was highly critical of the republic and rejected a lot of its legacy - yet he was enthusiastic for the autobahns ; so in that respect , he ** did ** build the roads , did n't he ? 
  i 'm going off of wikipedia here , so do correct when necessary , but since railways were the primary lifelines of industrial and military transport , the intent of building the roads does n't seem to have been part of the future war effort , either . 
  i 'm not going to try and persuade you otherwise ; you extend the total image that we now have of the nazis to try and convince me that a single detail , like the autobahns , was not an accidental element of the nazi state ( since plans were laid during the weimar republic ) , but an integral one instead . 
  i am at a loss about what to think : were the autobahns a mistake or not , if they were conceived by the weimar republic , but built during hitler 's time ? 
  were the germans of that time right in building them , or should we condemn them for it because of what happened later ? 
  i remain unconvinced . 
  edit : i remain unconvinced as to your statement that nazis could never have been right about anything historically , and nazis ( i.e. 
  far-right groups ) ca n't ever be right about anything today - a statement that seems predicated on what hitler did during wwii . 
  it 's an absurd notion to me : that 's the whole problem with far-right extremism ; it 's not dangerous because it ca n't ever be right - it 's precisely dangerous because some elements of its ideology , in separation , may appear to be acceptable !, 
  it 's what the whole picture builds to that is the problem , yes , absolutely . 
  have n't you editorialised the title * ever so slightly * ? 
  germany should immediately demolish all remaining autobahn stretches built in the 1930 's / 1940 's , as they were built under hitler 's reign and are therefore wrong , due to nazis being unable to ever have a valid point . 
  building * those * autobahns was a mistake that needs immediate rectifying . 
  is this the quality of discussion we want to endorse ? 
  i would venture calling it `` irrational '' , but that may be subjective . 
  i dare say dclauzel gets the attention he gets not through his comments , but mostly through his mod actions ( albeit the comments play a certain role as well ) . 
  what is your reasoning for such a sentiment ? 
  are you saying immigration is a non-issue ? 
  why did they use a throw-away , then ? 
  are they banned on this subreddit ? 
  as opposed to your expertise hidden behind a 1-hour old throw-away ? 
  since it 's a replica of about 6 metres in height , i 'd say it 's sufficiently far off not to constitute `` south africa 's eiffel tower '' . 
  unless we 're including 20 cm souvenir-models of the tower in our discussions of `` polish eiffel towers '' . 
  to put it bluntly ( without opining on whether it 's good/bad , happy/sad , pc/un-pc , haram/halal , kosher/non-kosher , etc. 
  ) : newton 's third law of motion seems to be taking effect .

  you 're right .

  at least i could read some spider-man and batman , so there was that . 
  i encourage you to watch the video again , for the video i watched three times now has a guy that talks about 5 or 6 hours , not 6 or 7 . 
  sapek 's definitely taken his talent to new heights with that trilogy , as far as i am concerned . 
  reminds me of the time i was on a long-distance train , taking a dump and suddenly we arrived at some minor city that i 'd have never guessed we 'd be stopping in . 
  my 15 minutes of very private embarrassment , while the people were getting off and on the train , saying their goodbyes ...

  i beg to differ , but if i did blunder indeed , then i 'd be only happy to have started sounding stupid already , if it 'll become some sort of a magic spell that can change the vector of where things are heading . 
  it 's the conflation of `` roma '' and `` romanians '' , would be my guess . 
  then there are at least two of us , as my musings point me to largely identical , ugly conclusions , however much i would wish it were not so . 
  in fact , i 'd be very happy to be proven a fool . 
  contrary to what the hive-mind may believe , it is not the score , but the words that should be important , albeit there are obviously arguments in favour of a score system ( which , unfortunately , becomes a target of various manipulative practices for the very reason the score system is worth having in the first place ; a catch-22-as-catch-can situation ) . 
  decadent ?
