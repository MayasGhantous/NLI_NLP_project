  do n't think so . 
  well , i 'd say it 's both smugness ( why not score a free hit , when the opportunity presents itself ) and genuine concern . 
  what insuperable impediments to a visit do you see ? 
  yeah , yeah , i know . 
  i was being facetious ( hence the broken english of the second paragraph ) . 
  what i found exceptionally funny was how , given the fact the author 's cartoons are regularly published in gazeta wyborcza ( which has always been vocally anti-pis , i.e. 
  the current majority and government party ) , this particular cartoon apparently failed to feature in gw , as evidenced by the lack of appropriate notice on [ the author 's site ] ( http://www.andrzejrysuje.pl ) . 
  what the matter , [ mr michnik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adam_michnik ) , the agenda it did n't computed ? 
  such sad . 
  yes , very broadly speaking , [ making something illegal ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-009-9127-y#/page-1 ) leads to a [ decrease of the prevalence of such behaviours ] ( http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7357/188?variant=full-text&amp;referer=www.clickfind.com.au ) in the population . 
  so making assault and rape illegal was a start , at least . 
  now , other measures need to be worked out . 
  do you think it 's a linguistic/legal/moral / spiritual/whathaveyou error to use the pronoun `` they '' to describe a group to which one does not belong themselves ? 
  is n't representing people what a government in a representative democracy does , even those who 've not voted for them and those who 've not voted at all ? 
  if the people feel misrepresented they wo n't vote them in again . 
  or wo n't vote at all again , but since they 're ignoring the system , they ca n't be angry that the system ignores their needs in turn . 
  it really is that simple in a representative democracy with no compulsory voting : vote and vote again . 
  if you do n't and are unhappy then it 's you who 's to blame . 
  do i err ? 
  well , you ca n't blame the government for the result they got if there is no compulsory voting in poland and half of the electorate chose of their own accord not to grace the ballots with their votes , especially given that it 's not the current government who set up the voting system to use d'hondt 's method ( to my knowledge ) . 
  so the blame lies with the lethargic , the disillusioned and the uninterested , not the government that was the result of such a flawed ( if flawed indeed it was , given the international - or more precisely - european norms for elections ) election . 
  or , indeed , the blame also lies with the aforementioned voting system in use ( for instance the ridiculous , in my opinion , kukiz '15 was elected largely , it appears given the lack of any other substance to his programme , on a platform of system change ) . 
  ah , right . 
  social being determines consciousness , all true , so very true . 
  or in other words : `` punkt widzenia zale\u017cy od punktu siedzenia '' ( your point of view depends on where you sit ) . 
  because it 's the voice of the radical ( i.e. 
  anti-capitalist revolutionary , i presume ) left . 
  look around that site . 
  ( as a side note - the op goes by the handle `` redeugene99 '' ; `` red '' as in `` better dead than red '' - who knows , who knows ), 
  yep , i mean look at the outlet - roar magazine , and the conotations that site is rich in ( the star in the a of roar - which stands for reflections on a revolution , the graphical style - e.g. 
  the closed fist in the newsletter subscription dialogue , the language ) . 
  is this the new organ of the comintern ? 
  ( is it the fourth one or have i skipped a beat ? ), 
  i mean , there 's the left and there 's the radical left . 
  are we allowing radical outlets as well in a place of such high moderation standards as / r/europe is ? 
  dear me , wo n't someone think of the children !, 
  but seriously - what is that article even about . 
  the title suggests it 's about the recent days ' toll of people who 've died of hypothermia ( most of whom were homeless who , sometimes being drunk/drugged , are often reluctant to accept help from the police / municipal guards ) ... but then goes off to point out unrelated accident-related deaths in the tatras , arriving at a combined death toll of 39 ... ... only to inexplicably jump to german migrant camps and their problems with providing heating and water to tents . 
  was whoever compiled this `` article '' on drugs , or just plain incoherent ? 
  ( also , i know it 's fashionable to say anything and everything bad about poland in nowadays ' europe , but [ look who 's talking ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/11382808/winter-death-toll-to-exceed-40000.html ) ; sorry that was just a random google pull , but muh proud patriotic self wo n't take this propagandistic jib for no retaliatory jab ), 
  a brief re-cap of how the situation unfolded , please ? 
  i 've got to dash , so ca n't elaborate much atm , but not to look far for an example - the ussr ( currently russian federation ) . 
  i agree that an ideal federation should be set up with no one having primacy over others ; i just do n't believe it 's practically possible in the eu 's situation , not without some drastic changes a ` la shock doctrine . 
  i also disagree that the eu must work to undermine national identities . 
  hence why i wrote the [ eu believes it must do this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395 ) . 
  i guess they figured it 'll be easier to reconcile pan-european interests in the absence of regional national interests . 
  call me a cynic , but ideals are nice and dandy , whereas reality is a bitch . 
  federation will be the solution , it wo n't arrive , however , before everyone acquiesces to who the * primus inter pares * will be . 
  that 's why the eu believes it must work to undermine the national identities within the eu - problem is , nature hates a vacuum and who can tell what 'll emerge on the ashes of the old order and whether it was in the eu 's best interest in the first place , rather than in some other , outside actor 's interests . 
  [ reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bni3or0wfhs ), 
  no , no , you have it wrong . 
  the government will not fall . 
  it will hang !, 
  i laugh . 
  continuously . 
  you better believe it . 
  three-quarters misleading flair , then , please . 
  misleading flair , please . 
  this refers to the 17th century , not the modern countries . 
  ( although when it comes to german , did n't the yiddish `` oy vey '' come from `` oh , weh '' ; so , actually , the jews took it from germans ), 
  and then there 's the question of whether non-white people are accepting of white people , as well . 
  click around and see them in colour . 
  have you tried contacting the regional coordinator ? 
  i 'm sure they have a dedicated helpline . 
  no day shall pass without that , as this government is highly uncomfortable for a progressive agenda . 
  ideally , to many people 's eyes , this government should be crashing in an air-plane in a foggy field somewhere ( does n't even have to be in russia ) . 
  failing that , ( the appearance of ) universal scorn , mass protests ( not just by paid protesters ) and an eventual stepping down ( the earlier the better ) will suffice . 
  then you 'll stop hearing about these vile nationalists , phooey , pox on them . 
  so if you know the answer better by dismissing one when it 's presented , why did you ask ? 
  as early as 1990/1991 the rallying cry of `` komuno wr\u00f3\u0107 ! '', 
  ( `` communism , please come back ! '' ), 
  could be heard at protests when the disillusioning reality of economic transformation became apparent . 
  then there were post-communist governments ( sld ) and a post-communist president ( kwa\u015bniewski ) . 
  they again were disillusioning ( i have n't yet seen a tally of which party is associated with more political and corruption scandals , po or sld , but it 'd be a close call , i imagine ) . 
  so , yeah , 1945-1989 ( +1993 -1997 +2001 -2005 ) . 
  i was taking a jab at the mod team 's apparent policy of arbitrarily flairing things up - people can always read the article and find up , but no , got ta hold those babies ' hands , lest they go astray . 
  yes , oui , ken . 
  convicto et combusto , if you 'll pardon my sloppy declension , i have n't worn my declension sackcloth for years now . 
  now , there 's a voice of reason - time to reverse this atrocious trend of acceptance toward darker-haired , darker-skinned people ( who , as well all well know from classic fairy-tales , are agents of evil , every last one of them ) . 
  what we need more of is fair people - a europe that is fairer all-round , jeremiah says so !, 
  `` misleading '' flair where ? 
  that facility cooperates with nato , but is not an accredited nato institution , is it ? 
  lol , joke 's on stupid europeans now crying about all those times they got themselves fingerprinted . 
  it 's right there in the universal declaration of human rights : no human being shall ever have their fingers printed . 
  [ article 50 . c ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsg4m1hpefi ) , look it up , birches !, 
  they 've been playing too much [ crusader kings 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings/comments/2eux07/what_the_freak_is_a_zunist ) , which is a hot-bed of reactionary pagan beliefs .

  dare i say ... hard ? 
  it was a data-collection scam , apparently . 
  and i 've even included my real number of sexual partners , of both sexes , as well as that one time with the pig , oh my . 
  what i found more shocking was the telegraph 's non-incisive approach to putting that tweet in their article . 
  i ca n't believe no one clicked the link to find out where it led - it does not bode well for how deeply the press really probes in their search for giving us `` full stories '' .
