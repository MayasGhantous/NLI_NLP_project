  syria , one heck of a country . 
  they 've got a civil war going on , an international war against the is , they 've got the immigrants , they 've got the refugees and they 've got the tourist .

  praise god , he 's just a tourist and he wo n't be detained in a refugee camp , deprived of most basic human rights and he 'll be at liberty to return to his homeland .

  cheers , i did what i could , given the circumstances . 
  let 's pursue that line of thought to its terminus . 
  let me try : spending $ $ $ on defence is silly and a waste of time/money ( unless you are the us of a ) ; hmm , education systems are a waste of time/money , as people can educate themselves , if they want to ; healthcare systems are a waste of time/money , as if people really cared about their health , they 'd care about their health themselves ; etc. 
  oh , have i gone too far and in the wrong direction ? 
  what do you think ? 
  i 'm not sure closing the markets to western companies would be beneficial , since i 'd wager western companies have already picked and chosen whichever local companies they wanted to buy and there ca n't be much left for them to seize . 
  unless we go full throttle and nationalise everything and [ glory to arstotzka !,

  the damage , so to speak , has already been done at the beginning of the 90 's , during the transformation - companies sold dirt cheap and now we 're in the ( financial ) world 's pocket . 
  conscription was abolished in 2009 by donald tusk 's party , with the last conscription taking place in dec 2008 . 
  i did n't really agree with that move ; even if the quality of the conscripts may have been low , it still was an avenue for some of the uneducated fellows ( as it was primarily aimed at men , and usually affected people who either could n't find any medical dispensation or did n't get into university and so did n't get a stay of service ; in fact , in a way , conscription may have been one of the driving motors behind the absurd over-bloating of the private higher education system , i reckon ) to do something with their life other than having to come up with drug smuggling schemes , or what-not ( since emigrating to the uk/ireland/norway / wherevs was a moot point at that time , what with poland being in the eu and there being no obstacles to moving outside the country , beyond the easy reach of the mil-pol ) . 
  in fact , people first started talking about re-instating conscription , if i 'm not mistaken , when the crimea/ukraine business started , so that ball 's been rolling for some time now - except following the war in ukraine it was pretty unanimously agreed by the major parties that we 'd have to up the defense budget share to meet the 2 % gdp nato quota .

  i suppose the desired end-result is something straight from an old polish joke : a patient in a critical state is brought in to the a&e and the surgeons quickly assemble to operate . 
  after several hours , the head surgeon emerges and the patient 's family are all over him , wanting to know the fate of their beloved one . 
  the surgeon says `` the operation 's been successful . 
  the patient 's dead . '',

  sandwiches for dinner ? 
  i 'm sorry , but are you a student that 's been brought up by a family of never-ageing students ? 
  seriously . 
  sandwiches for dinner a norm in poland . 
  that 's the most ridiculous thing i 've heard this week . 
  unless by saying dinner you mean supper . 
  then yes , sandwiches for breakfast and supper , quite common , albeit under the influence of western work culture it 's changing . 
  for it is work that largely determines the daily rhythm , including meal times . 
  traditionally , poles worked 7 am - 3 pm . 
  nowadays , 8 am - 4 pm is common - so we 're not quite there yet with the anglo-saxon model of 9 am - 5 pm . 
  i 'd say the traditional model for meal times was : breakfast in the morning ( so 6 , 7 am , 8 am , or whenever you get up ) , maybe a second breakfast at 11 am or so ( a sandwich , or a light snack ) , then dinner - either at work ( if there was a cafeteria ) or back at home , so at 2:30 pm , 3 pm , or around 4 pm . 
  finally - supper in the evening , sometime between 7 and 8 pm . 
  nowadays , with work time moved to 8-4 , or 9-5 , with commute times increased due to traffic jams and commercial side-treks , a lunch-dinner model is becoming increasingly more common . 
  so lunch at work , or in the city , at around 1-2 pm , dinner back home - either prepared beforehand if you had the foresight to do so , or made after coming back home ( which 'll frequently include going shopping on your way home , although people 'll often do huge shopping at the weekend and use the supplies to make dinner throughout the week ) . 
  supper becomes optional and reduced to a lighter snack in this model . 
  this is based on experiences in my social circle , so ymmv .

  with drugs - i 've had as much to do as with mercedes cars which is naught . 
  and i 'll never believe that my child had anything more to do with that since not long ago he 's had better clothes than his peers from high school but i 've not asked him , had no time for that to feed all those mouths i 've been doing two shifts his brother 's in the army , like the good lord ordered older sister 's got a proper husband younger sister 's finishing junior school this year i wo n't believe he sells drugs to school-children was a good lad and he never drunk much x4 he was a good lad and never drunk much x2 etc. 
  under this clock in my old factory year after year i 've gone beyond my quotas you got ta work your arse off now , to feed a family i could n't keep an eye on them after work your honour !, 
  i repeat , i wo n't believe that my younger son , though he do n't do drugs himself sells them in town to very young folk why , he once won a table tennis competition !, 
  i wo n't believe he 's not gone to school either for three years now . 
  i mean , he said he went never saw the certificate , said he 'd lost it after work , i was too tired to talk to him wife 's unemployed , she cooks dinner used to be for romaszewski , i vote jaskiernia now .

  coming across single examples of their fabricated reality is shocking , looking at a collected list is beyond mind-boggling . 
  cheers for the link . 
  i 'm referring to the cartoon girl in the picture , as the picture is described as homophobic . 
  what i am able to gather from that picture is that the girl is heterosexual ; this i declare with a sufficient dose of certainty . 
  whether the cartoon girl in the picture is homophobic , and whether - by extension - that makes the whole picture homophobic - that i can not so easily discern . 
  hence my initial query : which part exactly is homophobic , for i fail to see homophobia here . 
  i think we should show a little tolerance for that heterosexual cartoony girl in the picture . 
  so it 's wrong for the girl not to like women and feel awkward when thinking of a male-male coupling ? 
  if i understand you correctly , that constitutes homophobia ? 
  only for the girl , though , right ? 
  so it 's maybe , like , saying the girl is heterosexual , like ? 
  nothing wrong or homophobic with that , right ? 
  and the homophobic part is where exactly ? 
  yes . 
  kidnappings and incarceration should be the way forward . 
  for the refugees own good .
