  some ten or twelve years ago , coming back home awfully drunk with my now-wife , we were approached and then accosted by two polish `` yufs '' asking for my phone , even though initially they asked for a fire . 
  in the left-hand pocket of my jacket i had a small can of pepper spray , with which i was fumbling , trying to get it out . 
  i said `` i do n't think so '' , to which they repeated their plea , applying a certain dose of push-suasion . 
  once again did i respond `` i do n't think so '' , finally managing to wring out the spray and proceeding to apply it to my interlocutors ' visages , followed by a grab on the shoulders of one and a few osculations between my boot and his face . 
  i think that was when my now-wife pulled me away and we eloped unhindered . 
  i do n't think i 'd have done anything quite so similar nowadays , but that is one anecdotal piece of evidence of how sometimes people can use a can of pepper spray , even in a state of more than mild inebriation . 
  i think i 'll never forget the 2011 ( ? ), 
  independence day , when german antifa members and their willing helpers on the polish leftist scene disrupted a national holiday , people celebrating their independence , and called it `` a fight against fascism '' . 
  that is the problem . 
  russia has putinbots . 
  does germany have antifa-bots ? 
  he knew what he was saying when he wrote that '' [ polen ] w\u00fcrden es bitter bereuen '' ( they 'd regret it bitterly ) . 
  the top 10 press companies in poland are : * agora sa ( financed by polish/international capital ; an avowedly anti-pis stance ) * ringier axel springer polska sp . 
  z o.o. 
  z o.o. 
  z o.o. 
  * gruner + jahr polska * phoenix press ( bauer media group ) * marquard media polska ( swiss capital ) * burda media polska sp . 
  z o.o. 
  ( german capital ) * edipresse polska ( swiss ) * presspublica sp z o.o. 
  ( 51 % british , 49 % polish treasury ), 
  gentlemen , start your media frenzy engines . 
  time to work on that pis-poland = fascist trope . 
  you might also want to add that you 've linked to `` asz dziennik '' ( a jab at father rydzyk 's `` nasz dziennik '' ) , which is essentially a local `` onion '' . 
  never been a fan of your apparently heavy-handed mod policy , but surely you can manage to articulate your point in a more developed way - or do you make comments as nonchalantly and sloppily as you mod ? 
  it passes muster , for what it is , albeit the nuances are debatable . 
  for example - the image of male , female and children characters running away from the implied conflict ( towards implied germany ) ; i suppose some people could take issue with the depicted proportions , arguing that they fail to reflect what we know of the gender and age make-up of the wave of people coming into the eu ; further , some could take issue with the fact that the male characters are wearing glasses implies a rich educational background , which would - again - seem to belie what has been ascertained of the wave of people coming into the eu . 
  but then again , it 's just a caricature . 
  i mean , if we ascribe this much meaning to it , we might as well start shooting people for these . 
  ( sorry , could n't resist ), 
  cheers . 
  austria and hungary , previously austria-hungary , had quite a lot in common , though . 
  it 's almost like / r/europe is not a homogeneous single-cell mega-organism . 
  it 's almost like it 's a community made up of various individuals ( and the assorted agenda-pushing blocs ) . 
  well argument 'd , m8 . 
  i can see the smut , but where is the culture ? 
  in her ** underwear ** , for christ 's sake !, 
  who do you think she is ? 
  a prostitute !, 
  thank you for organising these . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  i hope it is indeed out of proportion . 
  dude . 
  another piece of the puzzle that 's being inexorably completed before our very eyes . 
  and people will blame the individuals , not the circumstances that led to this . 
  well , you ca n't make an omelette without breaking some eggs . 
  does n't matter if it 's the local citizens who will have to give up what they 've been working their whole lives for , or the opposite side , the migrants and those in favour of unrestricted immigration . 
  mass riots , civil unrest , bomb attacks , shoot-outs in the streets and things better left unspoken - when ? 
  or : a massive police clampdown , a police state catering to the new arrivals in the name of observing international commitments and lofty humanist goals - when ? 
  as always , the answer will depend on who controls the police and the armed forces . 
  european winter ? 
  spring ? 
  summer ? 
  i think you are making the fundamental mistake of thinking that words that people utter have any meaning . 
  we live in a world where words hardly ever matter any more . 
  to speak is easy , to do is harder . 
  it 's what they do , not what they say that matters . 
  do n't you worry about the flair next to my user-name , it 's perfectly fine . 
  that it creates hazardous situations is indisputable , due to how ricochets work . 
  i had been hoping the short video ( or rather : the incident itself ) from gorz\u00f3w i 'd linked to would prompt a review of the procedures , but that has n't happened - to the extent of my knowledge - as it was n't a sufficiently high-profile case , apparently . 
  i would like to link to some statistics for the us , but i ca n't seem to find anything appropriate , so will gladly hear any definite stats . 
  anyways , no disputing ricochets are a real danger . 
  for instance , one theory i 'd once heard about the much-publicised [ 1970 's gdynia protests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_polish_protests ) and the 42 people who died there and then was that the [ mo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milicja_obywatelska ) were given the order to fire warning shots to stop the advancing crowd , but they did n't take into account the fact that this was on a street ( ca n't say for sure whether paved , concrete , or cobbled ) and the shots ricocheted . 
  i doubt if it 's true , given the extent of casualties , and the generally accepted version is that it was shoot to kill , but yeah , it is what it is . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  using the [ polish ] ( http://www.policja.pl/pol/aktualnosci/87319,nowe-przepisy-dotyczace-srodkow-przymusu-bezposredniego-i-broni-palnej.html ) example ( specifically the [ detailed regulations ] ( http://www.policja.pl/download/1/111616/uprawnieniapolicjanta.pdf ) - warning , downloadable pdf ) , here 's what the procedures are for the use of weapons in poland ( and i 'll be quoting from the detailed document , trying to faithfully translate ) : * use of firearms is a last resort , when other methods of coercion have failed , or the use of other methods is impossible due to the circumstances of the event * firearms are used ** in such a way as to cause the least harm possible ** ( emphasis mine , since it clashes with the us-inspired , i presume , doctrine of `` shoot to kill '' you quoted ) - in practice this is most often interpreted as going for [ leg shots ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydiyew4jaa ) . 
  * firearms can not be used against pregnant women , children visibly under the age of 13 , and people visibly handicapped ; with the caveat that firearms can still be used against these groups of people in the event of an immediate , illegal attack against the life and health of the police officer or any other person if non-lethal methods of coercion are insufficient . 
  these are the preliminary , overriding rules . 
  then follow the detailed procedures . 
  the ** full procedure ** before using a firearm : * 1 . 
  the police shout `` police ! '', 
  to identify themselves * 2 . 
  the police call on the person to obey the law , particularly to : * a ) immediately drop any weapon or dangerous item that can be used to endanger the life and health of the police officer or any other person * b ) abandon any attempts to escape * c ) desist from using violence * 3 . 
  in the event the above are not met with compliance , the police officer warns that they 'll use a firearm : `` stop , or i 'll shoot !, 
  '' , and if this proves insufficient - fires a warning shot in a safe direction . 
  the ** shortened procedure ** before using a firearm : the above full procedure or its elements , particularly the warning shot , may be abandoned or abbreviated if carrying them out would cause an immediate threat to life or health of the police officer or any other person . 
  [ then there is also a bit about how escorted prisoners have to be informed that they may be shot at in the event of an escape attempt ] so this is the polish perspective on warning shots . 
  what we need now is the bulgarian one , to see how applicable or inapplicable your scorn against `` warning shots '' and `` people who 've never seen a civilian weapons training course '' is . 
  please find below a `` reply '' button with enough empty space for you to explain properly what a warning shot is :, 
  good production values , for the circumstances , and a good atmosphere for the first five minutes . 
  then it gets embarrassing with how forced the plot is . 
  the rest of the movie is a mixture of boring segments ( the soldiers hardly ever speak , and since it 's mostly english the polish actors are visibly struggling to convey emotions in a language they could stand to know more ) , embarrassingly forced pathos . 
  it was unbearably drawn out . 
  the best thing in the movie was the hardware provided by arms companies and the iraqi helper who had to sell a polish captive out to rescue his daughter . 
  edit : oh , and the bulgarian actor portraying their commander , he was also good . 
  pass this up . 
  you forgot the `` d '' . 
  sometimes when i 'm tired i think i 'm losing my mind with all those '' - izes '' instead of '' - ises '' . 
  does it matter whether the protesting groups are related to right wing and far right parties ? 
  does that invalidate the whole protest ? 
  are you saying right parties are not a representation of a portion of the society ? 
  germany banning right parties when ? 
  thanks for your response as well , i am glad you have not reacted with outright hostility . 
  yes , i agree - it looks simple in an exaggerated example , but it gets harder the closer we try to apply it to the real world . 
  you mention myopia - is it genetically inferior ? 
  well , in my example i 've mentioned the safety net that we 've created in the modern world . 
  myopic people can wear glasses , contact lenses , they can have laser surgery , if i am not mistaken - their life is functionally not that much different from people with perfect sight , but there is a difference . 
  that it has spread , again , like i 've previously indicated , is because in the modern world myopia is much less a question of mere survival , but more of a comfort of life . 
  and yes , we fully agree - things are not black and white with genetics . 
  for instance , i fear that because the modern world has become so sheltered and accommodating , having largely eliminated natural factors from the darwinian equation , that there may come a breaking point where our society becomes saturated with genes we can hardly consider positive ( myopia , asthma , hereditary diseases , etc. 
  ) ; that once that saturation point is reached , the sum total of the various genetic deficiencies will be greater than the value of its parts and our societies , or humankind in general , will no longer be able to cope .
