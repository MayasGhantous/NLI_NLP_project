  in other words , that the gene pool that 'll be available will not have any candidates for survival . 
  ( i hope you can see that i 'm talking of remote dystopian things that echo sci-fi literature ; i hope it 's just an unfounded fear , but fear it is nevertheless - for instance , i 'm hoping genetic manipulation , as depicted in the great sci-fi masterpiece [ gattaca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gattaca ) , a cold reality though it may have seemed , will allow humankind to move forward , in a way not too dissimilar to nietzsche 's * uebermensch * , of becoming better humans , but not in the meaning that was hi-jacked by the nazi 's ) thanks for understanding . 
  lastly , let me just add , in honour of you displaying a greek flair , that i have always been in awe of the greatness of the ancient greeks ' testament , especially of aristotle and socrates , whom i consider to be among the greatest humans to have ever lived . 
   but it 's just like evolution ; and the beautiful birds which can not fly as quickly as the others being the ones the alligator snaps up . 
   [ ... ] just like the superior genes . 
   how they come to dominate does n't matter -- that they dominate in an environment means they are better and will win . 
  it 's specifically this part of / u/lolmonger 's post that made me think of * the golden man * , as it echoes closely with how the story ends , the way i remember it : ** spoilers ** for all the technological prowess and all the organisational clout behind humankind , their best efforts fail when faced with the eponymous mutant , the golden man , strongly implying that mankind is doomed in the face of what 'll likely be the next dominant species on earth , as he elopes with a desirable female , whom the mutant had mesmerised with his innate , feral charm . 
  ** less spoilers beyond this point ** therefore , if you could explain to me what is so xenophobic about stating that some genes are superior and some are inferior , i.e. 
  some genes make survival easier and more likely , some genes lend themselves to a greater chance of extinction . 
  i know , the echoes of darwinism , eugenics - this is hardcore scary stuff the modern world , apparently , can not handle discussing . 
  let 's take , an exaggerated example , yes , a gene responsible for blindness . 
  this gene , were it to propagate , could - i dare say , but will stand corrected when proven otherwise - lead to a situation where the majority of the population are blind , thus arguably decreasing chances of survival when faced with all sorts of man-made and natural dangers . 
  that our modern world allows for , to greater or lesser degrees , autonomous existence of blind people is a testament to our ability to overcome problems , but were it not for the safety net of a modern society , these people would be at a severe disadvantage compared to people who can see . 
  this is going deep into abstract territory , but let 's say we ascribe a value to the ability to see : a value that blind people will lack . 
  therefore , they have to struggle ( to a lesser or greater degree ) with things people who can see take for granted : blind people 's lives are literally harder ( more full of obstacles that need overcoming ) , in that sense . 
  pardon me if i misunderstood your point , but to me your claim that saying there 's no such thing as superior or inferior genes ( in the context of the survival of a species , or just living a life ) is trying to belie what , to me at least , appears to be an objective , underlying truth . 
  did we come any closer to seeing eye to eye or am i gravely mistaken ? 
  i am serious in extrapolating what was written in the post that 's been since deleted and asking whether i expressed the sentiment contained therein appropriately in my paraphrasing . 
  let me try again : is dialogue meaningful or meaningless ? 
  does dialogue become meaningless when the other side at one time or another represented views that wildly clash with yours ? 
  how big does the clash have to be to justify such ostracism ? 
  the sentiment you 've expressed was nicely put into words in the phillip k. dick novella , [ * the golden man * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_golden_man ) , which i heartily recommend if you have n't read it . 
  ( a story that was then maimed in that horrible nicolas cage film , * next * ), 
  `` in a discussion on a contentious topic , people who present a stance wildly different from mine should have no voice . '', 
  did i do it justice ? 
  really . 
  have you even watched the documentary ? 
  you are not interested in dialogue , are you ? 
  fine , the first source linked to was - to you , apparently - `` tainted '' . 
  fine . 
  stay on the right side of righteousness and ignore it . 
  just find that ch4 documentary , `` things we wo n't say about race '' and watch it . 
  it 's an hour long , but i dare say it 's worth it , if you 're an open-minded person in pursuit of understanding the world around you . 
  you may be indignant and call your interlocutor a racist from your high horse , but this is not a way forward . 
  i really encourage you to watch the documentary ( the full one ) that 's been referenced and try to understand why there is ( perhaps more than just ) a grain of truth in what / u/emilm says about you being part of the problem . 
  if you do n't want to talk frankly and cut off the discussion with labels then it is a problem . 
  quite frankly , it 's hard to discuss numbers you 've , as per your own admission , pulled out of your arse , because who knows what else you 'll pull out of there . 
  but seriously - does anybody know whether lng imported by sea will actually be even more expensive then gazprom 's current asking price ? 
  contents of the article and sentiments expressed therein irrelevant due to mathematical shortcomings . 
  world saved . 
  case closed . 
  move on . 
  ** neeeext !, 
  they are only the lesser evil if you buy into the alternate reality created by po ( not that pis is not offering their own interpretation of reality ) . 
  what needs to be remembered though , is that the idea for the terminal was initiated by [ pm marcinkiewicz 's government ] ( http://www.pb.pl/1383084,38118,marcinkiewicz-rzad-zdecydowal-o-budowie-gazoportu ) ( pis ) in 2006 , a year before the pre-mature elections due to the dissolution of the pis coalition government ( pis , lpr , samoobrona ) . 
  po only started moving ahead with that original 2006 plan in [ 2010 ] ( http://www.wnp.pl/artykuly/terminal-lng-4,6683.html ) - after the presidential plane crash in smolensk of april 10 that year . 
  ( it needs to be added that the [ gas deal signed by the minister of economy pawlak ] ( http://www.tvp.info/3153165/informacje/biznes/umowa-gazowa-z-rosja-wreszcie-podpisana/ ) , from po 's coalition party psl , in 2010 - also after the presidential plane crash - tied us to over-priced russian gas for quite some time , despite the controversy it was - and is still - causing , especially given this lng alternative that was not pursued with enough vigour , i dare say ) we should also remember that germany , the same germany that built the [ nord stream ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream ) in cooperation with russia , was [ opposed to poland 's lng terminal ] ( http://gospodarka.dziennik.pl/news/artykuly/300495,polska-wygrala-niemcy-nie-zablokuja-gazoportu.html ) , voicing its disapproval over eu funds that could make it possible and citing environmental reasons . 
  the eu commission approved the terminal despite german concerns . 
  all the delays and irregularities aside , the issue of the terminal resurfaced in 2014 , during and following the russian annexation of crimea , when in the face of russian unilateral policy of * fait accompli * polish politicians - even po - woke up to the grim realisation that they 've been fucking about , too focused on trying to determine who 's the saddest sack of manure around . 
  so this opening , which is rightly pointed out as an election campaign stunt , to me is nothing else but a display of po 's consistent mediocrity that is laid bare when lady luck does not serve them . 
  concluding , while po may be the lesser evil in some people 's view , they 've still not had the chance to learn their lesson . 
  they need to go and be gone , before they can learn anything meaningful . 
  this just goes to show how deep the corruption in fifa/eufa/pzpn runs . 
  the fuckers had a streaker ready to go off at a moment 's notice . 
  bet they drugged the scotties ' goalie in that time , too - some sort of nifty light-ray poison type of thing , delivered with the very camera the selfie was shot with . 
  what has . nowoczesna 's behaviour been so far ? 
  words are cheap ( for free in fact ) , what have they done thus far ? 
  ( i 'm curious , it 's not an attack ), 
   [ a ] bunch of power hungry idiots and this description does n't apply to which of the political parties on offer exactly ? 
  to be frank , i dare say that for your grandparents it likely was more a question of sheer physical survival , or at least not a life of indenture/slavery to the * herrenvolk * , rather than just domination . 
  i 'd argue there was a difference between the level of control germany was trying to exert over other countries back during wwii and the level of control its trying to exert now . 
  it 's a separate issue of how justified germany 's self-appointed leadership role is , but i also think - given the evidence of the ukraine crisis and this present , however you may want to call it , crisis - the eu does need a stronger , most likely more centralised leadership that will inevitably encroach on national sovereignty . 
   with enough parties to sink a battleship i hardly think that is going to happen i 'm sorry , but what does that even mean ? 
  ( language barrier , if you will ), 
  when was the last time this map was updated ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/31744/ulice_infografika.jpeg ) infographic , which has the above list as well , streets named after famous figures are as follows ( names are in the accusative case ) : * 1 .

  honestly , [ not an opinion i thought i could expect from you ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/winner ) . 
  cheers for the context . 
  you are free to provide a proper , corrected version . 
  what do you propose ? 
  do you have a source for that 90 % poster figure ? 
  that 's the title of the article linked . 
  hey , hey , now , this is all just a joke . 
  more and more people everyday understand russian humour , so no need to be upset . 
  we know you are just awful teases , it 's okay . 
  well , i think first of all , it needs to be made clear that finland is guilty of ever existing in the first place , preventing unborn russian citizens from living there . 
  hey , hey , now , i had n't heard of these russian claims * vis-\u00e0-vis * finland previously . 
  now we can swap stories - here 's one from poland . 
  you may have heard of the russian ambassador 's to warsaw recent comments detailing his alternative approach to history ? 
  well , on monday he 's been called to meet the minister of foreign affairs , he retracted that bit about poland being hitler 's cronies and having brought ribbentrop-molotov onto itself ( or whatever bullshit he was spurting ) ... ** but ** the russian embassy 's spokeswoman accused the tvn24 journalist of being biased and unprofessional . 
  attack is always the best defence !, 
  in all the recent influx of forced immigration topics , i missed the russian media 's antics . 
  personally , i 'd say * u\u015bcisk d\u0142oni * , my wife said * u\u015bcisk r\u0119ki * when i did an experiment on her ; in practice you 'll likely to meet either version , although i do n't have any corpus statistics on the prevalence of one over the other . 
  * palm * , again , [ not just according to my whims ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/palm?s=t ) , is a more specific part of the * hand * - its inner surface . 
  i think the confusion might be stemming from the fact that , at least in polish , there 's no separate word for * palm * , you just say * sp\u00f3d d\u0142oni * ( `` the inner/bottom part of the hand '' ) . 
  do other slavic languages have a separate word for * palm * ( as the inner surface of the * hand * ) ? 
  there seems to be some confusion here . 
  * hand * typically refers to [ the terminal , prehensile part of an arm ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hand?s=t ) . 
  the polish * d\u0142o\u0144 * is defined by pwn 's dictionary as [ `` the part of the arm * from the wrist to the tips of the fingers '' ] ( http://sjp.pwn.pl/sjp/d\u0142o\u0144;2452534 ) , therefore * d\u0142o\u0144 * appears to be the best translation for * hand * and it is what i 'd suggest should be over poland . 
  the word * r\u0119ka * is , most commonly , used to refer to the english * arm * , albeit yes - in practice * r\u0119ka * can be colloquially used in reference to the * hand * . 
  i ca n't say for certain how that pertains to the other slavic languages . 
  in the olden times , this was called `` magic spells '' . 
  it 's the 21st century , and the repertoire of magic spells known to the western civilisation is probably ( no sauce , wild , unimaginably wild speculation ) the largest since the witch pyres have stopped . 
  the german n-word , the american n-word , the anti-anti-russian r-word , the universal r-word , etc. 
  this is pretty potent everyday magic we 're talking about .
