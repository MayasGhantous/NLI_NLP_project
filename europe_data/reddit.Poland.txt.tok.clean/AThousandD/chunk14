  i should know what i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm a wizard and i refuse to accept this reality any longer , which will allow me to reconcile completely contradictory sets of beliefs with not a semblance of reflection in my pretty little head . 
  ignorance is strength . 
  trust me , it works . 
  embrace the inner simpleton in you . 
  yes , i supposed so and gave the person writing it the benefit of the doubt ; hence a lack of an attack on my part . 
  i did n't mean the semantic quibble of `` east europe vs central europe '' . 
  that is beside my point now ( albeit geographically i 'd say poland is central europe , politically it 's a different matter ) . 
  in general , i agree with you - naturally , poland has a lot in common with bulgaria , hungary , etc. 
  i was merely referring to the spelling issue of `` polish ( poles ) '' vs `` bulgarian , hungarians '' . 
  no , why the over-reaction ? 
  completely out of place . 
  it 's just a mistake i see people make too often and , without going into details over whether it 's accidental or intentional , would like to see corrected . 
  did n't hurt anyone , did i ? 
   the polish , hungarians , bulgarians , etc. 
  one is unlike the others , it seems ? 
  does n't hurt anyone to ask , does it ? 
  got ta catch 'em all ? 
  well , i 'll agree with you on the cargo pants and flip flops , but as you yourself recognise race and sexual orientation is another territory . 
  [ the constitution of the republic of poland ] ( http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm ) * chapter ii , article 32 , pt 2  no one shall be discriminated against in political , social or economic life for any reason whatsoever . 
  like i said , no expert knowledge , but this article makes me wonder - whether what fb did did not discriminate against the group . 
  additionally , there 's also * chapter i , article 13  political parties and other organizations whose programmes are based upon totalitarian methods and the modes of activity of nazism , fascism and communism , as well as those whose programmes or activities sanction racial or national hatred , the application of violence for the purpose of obtaining power or to influence the state policy , or provide for the secrecy of their own structure or membership , shall be prohibited given that the organisation is not delegalised , there are currently - to the best of my knowledge - no cases aiming to delegalise it , the symbol used by the organisation is not illegal either - then i do have to wonder how justified fb was in applying their t&c . 
  i made no claim to be one , and stated as much plainly . 
  is that how it works ? 
  why do games , produced by private companies , have special versions for the german market ? 
  why do facebook and google modify their services , for instance , in china ? 
  i do n't know , i 'm not a lawyer - maybe you are ? 
  if so , i 'd appreciate it if you could explain what i perceive to be a contradiction . 
  even if you are n't a lawyer , maybe you have a better understanding of these things that i do , i 'll be grateful for anything that can clarify this . 
  it helps if you nuance who exactly is a nut-job to you by specifying why you believe them to be nut-jobs , for instance by listing their nutty behaviours and beliefs . 
  that way the likelihood of triggering a defensive stance and causing the debate to devolve into name-calling is possibly smaller . 
  the cross is from [ narodowe si\u0142y zbrojne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_armed_forces ) , in fact . 
  it 's because of the falanga , which is not an illegal symbol under polish law . 
  where is this quote from ? 
  except the polish constitution guarantees freedom of political beliefs . 
  and since the group in question is not delegalised , the assumption follows that what they believe in is legal . 
  hence , fb can be seen to be stepping over local laws . 
  naturally , there is of course the question of incidental behaviours that can be attributed to people who are identified as belonging to the group , and where they step over the boundaries set by law , a reaction follows to clarify whether a transgression indeed took place , as far as i can tell . 
  over my dead body . 
  60 % of the scale of a full-sized pic , 60 % of the upvotes . 
  such is life in the world of tiny . 
  what has the geographical location of auschwitz to do with this ? 
  how many poles were involved in the decision to locate the german concentration camp in that particular place , and not some other ? 
  as for your claim - if it should be illegal , then i guess it 's a question of time when a ( n internationally recognised ) campaign is launched to make that dream a reality . 
  but before that happens , i do find it somewhat intriguing that an international private entity takes it upon itself to police what is or is n't legal . 
  i thought it 's generally companies who comply with local laws , not local laws which are superseded to comply with company policies , but maybe it is common practice , i do n't know . 
  could you elaborate why you thought it fit to call her a clown ? 
  the symbol is not illegal under polish law - should polish law now be amended to comply with facebook 's policies ? 
  i was under the impression that the a given social media outlet is the more valuable the more of a one-stop-shop it is . 
  so going to the rather empty or the rather forgotten nasza klasa is not going to achieve the goals of using a social media outlet , if one seeks publicity and easy access to as large a number of people as possible . 
  would n't you agree ? 
  where art thou , oh , proofs , indeed !, 
  i 've heard that the internet never forgets - is there a mirror of the message on vkontakte that was taken down ? 
  is there some sort of website archive we can use to see that message ? 
  why would that message have been posted to coincide with the shooting down of the plane - where would the unaffiliated people have learned about the shooting down ? 
  they did n't have any vetting system to check whether they were not undermining donetskan morale by posting about dpr victories which in reality may have been ukrainian victories ? 
  cheers for the post . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but there appears to be some contradiction . 
  unnamed senior defence source quoted by the the sunday times :  a ** kill list ** has been drawn up ** containing the names ** of hundreds of very bad people . 
  a lot of them are from the uk . 
  and later :  ** we do not have exact numbers of uk nationals ** in iraq . 
  the figures which have been in the press are just estimates . 
  we know there are british people in iraq , but ** we have no idea of their identities ** odd . 
  in what capacity does he operate now ? 
  i thought he stood down as the leader of ukip after the referendum and there was a bit of a mess with his successor who herself stepped down quickly . 
  is farage back to leading ukip ? 
  what am i looking at ? 
  seriously . 
  i need to make my sarcasm much more transparent . 
  you do n't seriously think i 'd earnestly link a source reputable enough to include articles like : * * confirmed demon : hillary 's inner circle attended occult ritual involving ` blood , semen and breast milk ' * * * the globalists are setting the stage for wwiii * by the acclaimed tyler durden himself did you now ? 
  so in case there are any doubts : i think the article i linked is preposterously surreal . 
  a hint that i 've included was a reference to mig-15 - the article talks about su-25 ( so there 's a 5 there at least ) ; mig-15 , being among the first jet fighters ever , have long since been retired from service back in the ussr , so - although i 've not verified it , so no proofs - i assume the ukrainian air force does n't operate any . 
  so let me say it again : the linked propagandistic article can be read for entertainment primarily , as a document on a peculiar sort of propagandistic mendacity second . 
  if it was n't entirely clear from the instant i posted my previous post , then i apologise for giving the readers here the benefit of the doubt as to their ability to think critically . 
  two excellent posts by you however , much obliged . 
  well , to be fair that one appears to have been done by their underlings in dpr , so here it looks like a case of kremlin just covering their arses for the benefit of its domestic audience , i guess . 
  or maybe it was a ukrainian [ mig-15 ] ( http://russia-insider.com/en/why-mh17-was-most-likely-shot-down-ukrainian-su-25-jet/ri9362 ) , afterall ? 
  who knows ?? 
  take a few deep breaths , maybe ? 
  the course-books may be bre , but accents will be up to the teacher and there are many with an ame accent . 
  plus , most course-books include a few parts where they point out differences between bre and ame and some teachers will continue to supply their students with enough information to effectively teach ame . 
  easily since the 17th century , for real real - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013muscovite_war_ ( 1605 -- 18 ) . 
  before that just [ the usual friendly border conquests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_war ) . 
  i 'm sorry i did n't make my sarcasm transparent enough . 
  british press is free and independent , of course . 
  it is a staple of every democracy the world over . 
  how is it explained , may i ask ? 
  the language itself should n't be a problem , does n't have to be one unless someone wills it to be , or someone fails to accommodate for the circumstances that english now finds itself in . 
  the thing is , from where i 'm sitting , that english - having become the * lingua franca * of the business world - is no longer a language that belongs entirely to the anglophones and , with felicitous communication in mind , the linguistic burden ought to be shared to accommodate for those circumstances : while non-native speakers learn english , the anglophones could also take steps to decrease miscommunication and increase understanding . 
  lastly , addressing your suggestion directly - why not indeed ? 
  well , this feeds us back to the previous point . 
  since global economy is run in such a large degree in english now and the economy is so globalised as well , it may be , in some situations , rather difficult to work for a local company conducting its business entirely in a local language . 
  you could find yourself limiting your up-market options if you did that . 
  you could find your company merged with or was acquired by a foreign company . 
  so , all in all , there 's more to it than meets the eye , i guess . 
  cheers . 
  yes , i was joking , as i believe it 's a common comedic theme of non-english speaking people failing to understand english speakers who then proceed to repeat what they 'd said , only slower and louder . 
  i agree with you that it 's about vocabulary and idiom mostly , but - especially pertaining to some ridiculously unintelligible british accents - also pronunciation , to some extent . 
  on the bright side - at least [ they 're not dumping hiv-infected drugs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products ) on the eastern european market , so we should be glad for what we get , i guess . 
  what else is new ?
