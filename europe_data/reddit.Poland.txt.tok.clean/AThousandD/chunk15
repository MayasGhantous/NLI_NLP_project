  it 's no coincidence that people are setting up shops with `` german household chemicals '' and `` german sweets '' and that they have a cult following from some . 
  outrageous , is n't it ? 
  that those dumb natives ca n't get what you mean even if you speak extra slow and extra loud ? 
  dimwits , who do they think they are !, 
  absolutely agree . 
  you know how people in multi-nationals are learning english so the hq has an easier time telling them what to do ? 
  well , the native speakers should also be learning on how to communicate unambiguously with non-native speakers , a sort of cultural sensitivity classes , if you will . 
  well , do you , per chance , remember [ the fuss that krzaklewski 's election staff kicked up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn0qo1qpv0a ) during [ the 2000 elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_presidential_election,_2000 ) , saying that marek siwiec mocked ( st. ) john paul ii , with further mocking at kwa\u015bniewski 's behest ? 
  ( and kwa\u015bniewski still managed to win despite that , in the good old days for sld before [ rywin-gate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rywin_affair ) . ), 
  it was [ 14 ( 17 since the incident ) years in total ] ( http://www.gloswielkopolski.pl/artykul/3621302,marek-siwiec-nie-zniewazyl-jana-pawla-ii-koniec-sprawy-sprzed-17-lat-zdjecia,1,2,id,t,so,sa.html ) before the court concluded that it was not a criminal act , but plain mockery . 
  at least everyone 's keeping their heads screwed on in the present case , and there are no [ 7.2662 mm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkrs6semcuk ) perforations performed for the time being , so that 's a definite up-side . 
  ha-hah , silly amurican !, 
  no , it does n't . 
  i just do n't like the sight of two men buggering each other when i 'm doing a break-in . 
  i mean , it 's their place of living , so it 's none of my business , but i 'm trying to do work there , so it 's kinda off-putting . 
  no , [ not really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_moscow_times ) . 
  a bit of context , if you please ? 
  what are we looking at ? 
  i would say an eclectic collection of 19th century polish painters , such as [ malczewski 's paintings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacek_malczewski ) - * inter alia * * the blind faun * ; [ artur grottger 's paintings and sketches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artur_grottger ) ; [ a few , iirc , works by jan matejko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_matejko ) . 
  many of the paintings will ring hollow for foreigners , however , i reckon . 
  maybe except malczewski , since he 's so extraordinary and different from anything else . 
  there is also a nice collection of renaissance * burgher * family portraits , a few weapons and pieces of armour from various periods . 
  not the biggest museum i 've ever been to , but not a small one either , and personally i liked the collections . 
  i am relatively confident it 's a smurf account for one polish poster . 
  i am not the whole country , for what it 's worth . 
  nor are the particularly bellicose people on your sub representative of the whole country , i hope . 
  to the 1980s ? 
  i do n't know whether you 've seen it , but have you seen the 1984 bbc 's tv drama , * threads * ? 
  it is rather hard to find it in its entirety , but i suggest you seek it out as - in my belief - it gives us a few notions of how not just nuclear war , but its aftermath may play out for some time . 
  what is more readily available , is [ a rather interesting debate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vct-xwb7m ) sparked by that film , which i also recommend , in case you have n't seen it . 
  you see , what you and / u/mogurakun point out is part of the problem , is n't it ? 
  the atrociously short attention spans , the inability to understand context , and the hashtagification of the world as presented by the media . 
  i once read [ tarkovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrei_tarkovsky ) made the introductory sequence of his * solaris * intentionally dull with the hope that bored people would leave the cinema and it would weed out those who did n't have the patience to really understand the film . 
  who knows , maybe ? 
  did you write that because you earnestly believe it , or was it something else ? 
  eu/nato retortions against spain for abetting russism when ? 
  [ sarcasm is for illustrative purposes only . ], 
  i do n't usually like short-cuts , but i will cut this short this time : what i 'm getting at is that , as became lucidly evident on the occasion of london 's russian embassy 's #gaybeargate and the reactions that followed both on here and on the russian sub , the so-called west and russia appear to be locked in their own echo chambers , medially speaking , and it 's hard to see how many russians will not resort to pointing out that when what they perceive as the enemy ( correct me if i misread the signals the russian media are sending ) , i.e. 
  nato as a proxy for the us , is criticising them , then they must be doing something right . 
  equally , when #russiadenies , we appear to be all smug and superior ( which some russians do not fail to take note of ) , but have we done anything about the situation ? 
  but what is the situation , first of all ? 
  in my view , that there appear to be , let 's call it , irreconcilable differences between how the west would like the world to run and how russia , as dictated by putin 's policies currently , would have it . 
  so what can we do about the situation ? 
  bomb russia , naturally !, 
  [ sarcasm and exaggeration used for illustrative purposes only ] but no !, 
  how can we - that 'd be the end of all humanity , because to bomb russia is to start a nuclear war - and russians , i believe , also regret the fact that they ca n't really use those icbms with impunity . 
  so we 're deadlocked , are n't we ? 
  but what about good ole dialogue - what happened to that ? 
  yeah , but , you ca n't just talk about human rights violations in russia , because what about the lynched negroes ? 
  was the egg or was it the chicken that was first ? 
  who was first to offend ? 
  are american retorsions the effect of russian action or the cause of the next one ? 
  how can we have dialogue when we do n't want to talk ( as a side note - [ the polish co-chair of the polish-russian commission for difficult issues resigned ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/artykul/1561493,polskorosyjska-grupa-ds-trudnych-rezygnacja-profesora-rotfelda ) in dec 2015 on the grounds that it was difficult to find common ground following russian aggression in ukraine , and russians said the broken dialogue was on the polish end , so there we were again , stuck ) . 
  the russians that come here and do n't automatically bash putin get hive-mind gang-banged into down-vote oblivion , because evil russists from asia , the get of mongols who follow der putinissimus - and well , yes , maybe sometimes they have crude words to offer , maybe at times the best some of them can offer is calamitous , but not to try to listen is to end attempts at productive dialogue ( because yes , a form of hostile dialogue will continue even over our iron curtain 2.0 , but not one that builds bridges ) . 
  likewise , it may be hard for someone of western sensibilities to try to find common ground with russians - because pride , the imperative not to bow your head , not to lose face . 
  and the lies , the manipulations , the echoes of the chamber where your truth and your truth alone is the truest truth and why would you listen to the weak gay-pigs ? 
  so dialogue does n't work , because we 're not honest about it . 
  how can we be honest - nato promised not to move east , but it did . 
  russia promised to respect sovereignty , but it did n't . 
  the cuban missile crisis and the hissy fit jfk threw !, 
  and now you plant an anti-missile shield on our doorstep , so you can bomb russia into oblivion with impunity , a russian might say !, 
  but wait - warsaw uprising and why did the soviets have to stop on the shore and wait for the uprising to bleed out ? 
  why , because they were overstretched , the supply lines were thousands of kilometres long !, 
  it was impossible to move another three kilometres to the other shore of wis\u0142a and into the west bank of warsaw !, 
  but the west intervened in russia during the revolution !, 
  they always hated russia !, 
  there were british soldiers on russian soil , invading !, 
  but !, 
  but !, 
  and so on ad infinitum , ever trying to square that circle . 
  -------------- * ad rem * to report the waship movement was news reporting , with perhaps a pinch of banter regarding the smokey-pokey chimney-choo . 
  to mull over it like so is to masturbate furiously ( a fault all sides are not devoid of , i 'd wager ) . 
  it 's not a god-damned football world cup , we do n't need updates in real time and , last i heard , [ nato logistics for afghanistan went through russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_logistics_in_the_afghan_war#northern_distribution_network ) and i did n't exactly hear a fuss about that . 
  so , cut the crap with `` anger '' , oh dear western media , because you 're making me angry at how stupidly circular our logic is - and making me angry over words on the internet is a feat worth admiring . 
  whose anger is it ? 
  `` spain is facing criticism '' - criticism from who specifically ? 
  auto-ironic hipsters . 
  source of data ? 
  well , vlad has some track record of appearing to do the good things for the domestic populace ; the issue state actors other than russia take with russia is that it sometimes tramples fundamental principles of the modern world , such as sovereignty , or it tramples non-russian interests ( e.g. 
  us interests , for one ) , such as syria . 
  whether amidst all the smoke and mirrors of what putin is and is n't he 'll have managed to do good for his people remains to be seen at the end of the day . 
  which is , in a very basic and generalised way , somewhat reminiscent of what 's going on in poland . 
  that pis has the support the polling groups claim is a product of them appearing to try to do the right things for a domestic populace ( as promised in their election platform ) , which may appear to trample democratic principles ( the constitutional court i 'll admit appears to be a transgression ; the other things quoted in the article - limitation of civil liberties , control of media , and politicisation of civil service are debatable - the latter two definitely par for the course whenever the government changes , so the drastically different reaction from our western partners raises a few questions ) , or which may trample non-polish interests ( such as foreign investments and profit margins ) . 
  whether they 'll have served us , poles , well at the end of the day remains to be seen , but judging by how rocky this boat ride has been ( rocked by both pis 's apparent ineptitude and blunders and by the scale of protest and discontent not entirely unaided by foreign actors ) , it 'll definitely be a testing period to see us through the next three years ( and three years is , by my reckoning , all they 'll get ) . 
  such is life . 
  and we lynch negroes . 
  or is it them ? 
  does n't matter anyway , as long as there 's some lynching somewhere , then all 's as the mores dictate . 
  / r/russia [ conforming to expectations ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/595irh/butthurt_westerners_getting_angry_by_a_caricature/ ) . 
  i am surprised it has taken that sub this long to spin this present topic about that twat tweet . 
  love of what ? 
  what was your `` kekekek '' supposed to entail then , if not mockery at perceived polish inferiority in the absence of data concerning the russian federation ? 
  why would you single out poland ? 
  there is [ a figure for 34 countries ] ( http://666kb.com/i/ddgqhhm1y4ajeg7ip.png ) ( polish decimal notation , apologies ) , as far as i can tell . 
  there are 21 countries where the percentage of 25-29 year-olds living with their parents is lower than in poland , and there are 12 where it is higher . 
  what makes poland stand out to you so ? 
  is it about countries formerly trapped behind the iron curtain ? 
  even then , there 'd be 4 countries where the share is higher than in poland , if we do n't count yugoslavia and the balkans , and 8 if we include them , by my count . 
  so , what exactly drew your gaze to poland , apart from a possible case of obsessive russian fixation with all things polish ? 
  share , might be we 'll all share a laugh together .
