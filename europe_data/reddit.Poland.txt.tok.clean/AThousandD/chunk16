  where do they get those 300 ? 
  work , loans , state/uni subsidies , support from parents ? 
  russians gon na be polonophobic , that much is clear . 
  how do they cope with studying full-time and paying for a flat ? 
  i 'm banned from / r/russia for , iirc , laughing at a guy who dismissed the r-m , so . 
  with no prior warning and no prior infractions either , which went against their rules of timed bans first , and a perma-ban only being the ultimate sanction . 
  i tried contacting the mods , to ask about it , they never responded to any of the messages i sent them over the months , so . 
  who knows , it 's been a few months , maybe i should ask them again what the reason for the ban was ? 
  it was n't the current year then . 
  government is our pm and the ministers . 
  bugger that ... 
  personally - i do n't , but i know there are people that do . 
  what percentage of the society that is , i would n't be able to say . 
  well , people who hate it , hate it as a symbol of something , i reckon . 
  for instance , in the cult comedy [ * rozmowy kontrolowane * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/controlled_conversations ) ( in reference to the militia announcing to speakers on the phone that their call was controlled , i.e. 
  they were under surveillance , as depicted in [ this scene ] ( https://youtu.be/m65sbpmkj6e?t=1h9m56s ) - though i do n't know whether it was a real practice as depicted ) , near the end there is a scene showing [ the collapse of the palace ] ( https://youtu.be/m65sbpmkj6e?t=1h28m55s ) . 
  so , yeah . 
  [ a brotherly gift from the soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_culture_and_science ), 
  used to be a standard over here as well , now it feels like it 's a much rarer thing . 
  you have been banned from / r/russia . 
  sigh ... edit : this was more in relation to the squabbling on here rather than the decision itself . 
  ockie 's razr : ` cuz it 's not illegal , is why !, 
  [ thou confoundst ! ... 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8w-_pfd4rg ), 
  tell us more , if it please you ? 
  to every action there is a reaction , and so the downward spiral continues . 
  i did n't read your question as an insult , nor would i like you to treat my quip as offensive . 
  * ad rem * i sha n't be able to help for lack of knowledge . 
  i assume we 're practicing nautical piracy and invading russian territorial waters as a matter of course . 
  we agree . 
  he does n't work in diplomacy ( since he 's in the mod ) ; whether he qualifies to represent the country in any capacity in any ministry is a separate matter which he appears to have settled with his graceful quip . 
  albeit maybe he was mindful of chirac 's scolding that reminded us that `` silentium est aurum '' , just phrased more aptly for modern sensibilities ; so a belated tit for tat , quid pro quo ? 
  i will , so speak for yourself . 
  i do admit , some people in our political scene really go out of their way to make being job a particularly difficult proposition even for someone well-seasoned in bullshit . 
  not suited for the ministry of foreign affairs , that one , to be sure . 
  he seems to have forgotten that he 's in the ministry of defence , not the ministry of war , though , unless he 's bored and trying to provoke the french into attacking us . 
  i had hoped it would n't be such a rough ride through the four years . 
  i can imagine worse things . 
  i do n't view this negatively , it serves an informative purpose and i 'm an ever-curious person . 
  i see your point , though . 
  maybe moderation has not been observed , maybe it was not modest . 
  sorry to hear it appears to irk you . 
  what about the philippines ? 
  to be fair , it unfortunately does . 
  although some combative individuals coming in to stir the hornets ' nest also appear to contribute to that attitude , unsurprisingly , i 'd venture . 
  i 'm with you here . 
  what , the us , the uk , other countries - they never do ? 
  you do you , no need to self-mortify into an inferiority complex , but as with everything - in moderation , for pride comes before the fall . 
  seek your sense of value , not pride . 
  i have a bit of a problem with a vivid imagination , and when i look at [ this photo ] ( http://chrisniedenthal.com/en/works/manekiny-1980 ) , there 's a bit of a back-story springing into my head . 
  so the store manager picks up the phone in the evening and their higher-up says that there wo n't be a delivery truck coming in the next day . 
  `` why not ? '', 
  the citizen asks . 
  `` just because . '', 
  the answer comes . 
  `` what the hell am i supposed to tell the women when they come in tomorrow ? '', 
  `` same as always . 
  ` in our continuing socialist struggle for world peace , we 've sent the newest collection of summer dresses to , oh i do n't know ... congo or some such fucking place ' - without that fucking place bit , mind you ... are you taking this down ? 
  good . 
  ` and in return the generous people of congo have sent their newest summer collection of chic female clothing ' there . 
  do i have to do everything for you ? '', 
  `` what do you fucking mean - congo ?!, 
  what do they fucking wear in congo ?! '', 
  `` what , do you want to tell them the secretary 's wife and mistress had their pick of the delivery and that we 've sent the rest to sopot so we can show full shops for our russian comrades ' visit ? '', 
  - at which point a third voice suddenly interrupts the conversation : `` this is a controlled call , citizen . 
  mind your manners '' `` oh , f. ... shut up , this is a serious matter , officer '' the supervisor barks and falls silent for a moment . 
  `` right . 
  lem me think . 
  here 's what you 'll do - do you still have some curtains in your emergency stock ? '', 
  `` sure . 
  it 's the emergency stock . 
  we never touch it , unless there 's an unexpected announced visit from the committee . '', 
  `` good . 
  do n't touch the flowery patterns , just pick some plain colourful ones , drape them around mannequins and have your personnel say it 's the congolese fashion . '', 
  `` you out of your mind ? '', 
  `` do you have a better solution ? 
  make it like a roman toga , or something , but leave the tits out in the open . 
  they 'll fucking stare and joke about those monkeys and that 's all we really need . 
  ah , and use black mannequins . 
  got it ? '', 
  the receiver slams down on the other end of the line and the store manager is left standing , mute . 
  `` i 'll fucking add a basket on top of their heads to make it look realistic . 
  they do that ... and a piece of silvery plastic as jewellery '' she thinks after a moment . 
  next day everything goes fine , if we ignore kids staring at the mannequins ' tits . 
  one kid , though - he 's not looking at the tits . 
  `` do women in congo have hooves ? '', 
  he says , staring at the naked feet . 
  ---------- p.s. 
  if you have a chance , read s\u0142awomir mro\u017cek 's short `` p\u00f3\u0142pancerze praktyczne '' ( practical breastplate ) . 
  it is scientifically proven that humans are incapable of experiencing joy unless they live in a representative democracy with a capitalist economic system . 
  it is known . 
  which topic do you recommend i should delve more into ? 
  ( have you read the whole comment chain ? ), 
  i am not sure what to make of it . 
  does your statement say more about me , about you , or the world in general , i wonder ? 
  would you feel more at ease if i had called you some names ? 
  why ? 
  to conform to - based on your insistence to indiscriminately lump in protesters and jihadists , i.e. 
  what i as a person born and raised in a christian , european , hetero-normative culture could label as `` terrorists '' , what i imagine to be - your notion of a religious nutjob who 's an offensive , narrow-minded , intolerant person ? 
  by the way - and i 'm not being wilfully obstinate here , or spiteful - when you say someone 's intention is * hate * , from a linguistic point of view , that somehow feels like an odd collocation .
