  have a nice day . 
  fun fact tangentially related to sobieski : there was a statue in lvov , depicting the king on horseback , from the time it was part of poland , saying `` the citizens of the city lw\u00f3w [ in polish it reads with a double-meaning - i.e. 
  the city of lions ] - ( to ) king jan sobieski '' . 
  after wwii when lvov no longer was inside polish borders , the statue was moved to gda\u0144sk , which has lions as supporters in its coat of arms , therefore erasing the meaning of `` the citizens of the city lvov '' and leaving just the metaphorical one `` the citizens of the city of lions '' . 
  four . 
  there ... were ... four ... words . 
  confirmed . 
  french humour is an alien concept to me ( * cf * charlie hebdo ) . 
  hackers . 
  hackers everywhere . 
  we can sort this out like civilised people . 
  no need for vulgarisms . 
  i 'm going to ask , as i always do when i see this . 
  you can type `` brits '' , `` indians '' , `` pakistanis '' , even `` eastern europeans '' , but `` polish '' instead of `` polish '' only in the edits ( discounting the capital letter at the beginning of one paragraph ) - as an afterthought ? 
  what was the physical/mental impediment preventing you from spelling `` polish '' correctly the first time round ? 
  talk to o about the vwp and your invitation will make more sense . 
  yes , so i 've heard , leading me to make the above comment . 
  i find it amusing and peculiarly satisfying at the same time that romania 's internet infrastructure defies the stereotype of it being a , roughly speaking , backward place . 
  that it was an observation made by someone sporting a romanian flair is the cherry on top in this for me . 
  the series is basically a documentary . 
  god willed it . 
  i rather enjoyed the series , ignoring the white-washing aspect , but the scenes where german actors spoke polish . 
  i think you 're making a wrong assumption . 
  this infographic only illustrates the percentage of people who 've not read any books in the last 12 months . 
  reading books does n't make you cultured . 
  it exposes you to stories and/or ideas . 
  whether you process those stories/ideas is not a given and as such should not be assumed to be automatic . 
  if you read articles daily , then i 'd wager you are exposed to ideas as well . 
  the only question you need to answer is whether you process those ideas well , and you 'll have an answer to whether you are less cultured than the average best seller reader . 
  ama request . 
  how does the life of a neophyte russian ultranationalist look like ? 
  what was the straw that broke the bear 's back ? 
  do you apply retortions and respond symmetrically to the virulent hatred and prejudice from the europeans and their american friends ? 
  i 'd be happy if you could go into a little more detail on how easily this would have been achieved and how it could have gone down more or less , had it not been for fdr 's man-boner , for i have to be quite incredulous of such a claim ( given a number of factors , chief of which is the baltics ' proximity to ussr vs the positions western allies eventually liberated ) . 
  close enough to trigger that flashback from where i 'm sitting . 
  serious flashbacks of [ `` the colour of pomegranate '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzlvpjnfdk ) . 
  serious flashbacks , oy . 
  showerthought : the leave brits are like russians in their feigned contempt and disregard of everything possibly touching on their national pride , but ready to strike back at the drop of a hat . 
  wow . 
  yes , interns is who i had in mind , for precisely the reason you stated . 
  you have misread . 
  i 've stated that federalism is a noble goal , i.e. 
  i believe that eventually it 'll be the next evolutionary step for european societies . 
  that future , however , is a very far off , as far as i am concerned , post-national time and as a product of the circumstances i 've grown up in , i can not accept what i see as ill-conceived attempts to rush that future forward . 
  my guess is that the fb page is staffed by obsessive federalists , who 're making the eu 's federalist drive more explicit - either with tacit agreement from the higher-ups , or in an inadvertent ( in that the idea 's been floated before by individual users on here and met with , as far as i could tell , generally negative responses ) blunder that 'll cause push-back to the ultimate goal of a federation ( which is a noble goal , but so far off in feasible practice as to be irrelevant , to me personally , at least ) . 
  it was a jest , the comment about finns being a different species . 
  an article was linked on recently , either here or on one of the main default subs , explaining how finns are a separate genetic group , or something . 
  sorry if you felt offended . 
  do n't think it 'll settle this beef with pork just yet , though . 
  where there 's a ( n ill ) will , there 's a way . 
  finnish scientists have recently discovered that finns ' genetic make-up is so drastically different from everyone else , that they constitute a separate species . 
  this map is about human rights . 
  the thing about getting pregnant is that it does n't affect just intelligent people . 
  unintelligent people also get pregnant . 
  as a six year old child you had known you were gay ? 
  i do believe there is an entirely different manner of rubbing going on , behind the scenes . 
  that is correct : the poland province had always been part of oceania . 
  this had always been the truth . 
  your map refers to the nato vs warsaw pact scenario . 
  so no , i dare say currently poland would n't likely be a target for nato nukes in the event of a ww3 , but rather the topols , satans , sarmats , or whatever the newest ones are called , [ some russians like to masturbate about ] ( http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20140925&amp;t=2&amp;i=976720328&amp;w=&amp;fh=&amp;fw=&amp;ll=780&amp;pl=468&amp;sq=&amp;r=lynxnpea8o0ql ) . 
  ( the amount of glee at the prospect of likely total annihilation for most life on the planet is something i 'll have to chalk up to \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0430 . ), 
  then we will have to differ in our perceptions . 
  i disagree . 
  i welcome any disambiguation in this instance , because idiots do n't deserve any shred of pretence . 
  the words of your house are `` hear me roar '' , oh latvianlion , am i correct ? 
  it certainly contributed a tangible impetus to the downfall , but it came at a time when * liberum veto * and the numerous wars had laid the foundation for that collapse . 
  a * coup de grace * , if you will . 
  money speaks louder than both actions and words . 
  that is oddly specific knowledge ... 
  the german onion , actually . 
  sick burn , dude . 
  it 's spelled `` it 's '' and `` imaginary '' , btw . 
  a [ hail cannon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hail_cannon ) , maybe ? 
  hey , now , that means not just white people can be racists . 
  this changes everything . 
  i was triggered so hard that i discharged . 
  let me see if i can twist this a bit . 
  doctor 's training , course on counter-acting chemical/biological threats - `` ah , so that 's how they 're going to protect themselves ... 
  so all we 'll need to do is * this * '' . 
  engineer 's training , principles of construction - `` ah , so that 's why some buildings collapse after a bombing and some do n't . 
  nah , it 's probably good that there 's at least some initiative to reconcile the fiction of `` doctors , engineers and rocket scientists '' with reality . 
  we must have a firm response to all those events . 
  nothing less than a finely worded slogan will do . 
  i propose : `` do n't harm others , it 's haram . '', 
  all , eh , we need to do is to promote this slogan widely . 
  our first line of offence ( this is a counter-attack , not a defensive measure , mind ) shall be facebook walls . 
  we will fight them on facebook walls , we will fight them on instagram and we will fight them in pokegyms !, 
  i am convinced this has solved the issue . 
  this . 
  as for the legal grounds , i believe it 's to do with a eu directive ? 
  i know there was a fuss about it back in 2014 in here , when the parliament voted in a law that allowed foreign police forces and rescue services to operate in poland . 
  ( same reason polish police could work in hungary during last year 's migrant crisis , with them having their analogous law , i presume ), 
  what 's with the phallus-shaped bottles of some drink ( wine , i presume ? 
  it 's a soviet union mentality kind of thing , i guess ? 
  the whole `` and you lynch negroes '' spiel ? 
  yes , i figured . 
  since i ca n't read japanese writing , i opted for a place where i at least understood where and what i was posting . 
  i understand the banana for scale , but where is japan ?
