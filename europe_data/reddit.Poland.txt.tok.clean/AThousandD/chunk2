  explicate , pray . 
  i know that well . 
  many of my friends are atheists or agnostics . 
  i am not a active catholic , but i clearly recognise christian influence that helped shape a culture i 've been brought up in - many core christian concepts guide my actions , even if i fail to observe participation in a formal liturgical ritual . 
  i am speaking sincerely . 
  i see i must have touched a raw nerve with my mention of `` christianity '' and the concept that european culture does , in fact , share a common christian root - a belief i hold firmly . 
  mine was , therefore , not a religious argument , rather than a cultural one . 
  do you deny that the foundations of european nations and their culture , east or west , find a major part of their roots in christianism ? 
  i am afraid i am unable to , as i am yet not entirely sure of merkel 's ultimate intentions and goals ; you would have to ask the original commenter , perhaps they will be of more assistance . 
  i was merely pointing out the metaphor they had employed , the way i understood it . 
  i wo n't be laughing . 
  i 'll be sad to see what europe will be enduring . 
  what gives me hope is the belief that we wo n't push away fellow christians , nor will they shy away from us , in our common time of need . 
  metaphor : europe as europeans ' mother . 
  the kind of mental leap of faith it must have required - flabbergasting !, 
  part of the joke . 
  the slogan , `` we\u017a si\u0119 pozbieraj '' , is something along the lines of `` get your shit together '' ( except not vulgar ) . 
  for a * connoisseur * . 
  ( that 's a pre-89 army joke , i 'm lead to believe ) the ministry of defence is holding a boxing tournament for all branches of the military . 
  for the final fight it 's an army commando versus a private from zakopane [ let 's call him a [ highlander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorals ) ] . 
  the army commando is expected to win easily and so the goral 's coach tells him : `` make me proud , hold out for 10 rounds , is all i ask '' . 
  the fight starts and the commando is pummelling the goral to pulp . 
  before the second round the goral 's coach asks : `` will you hold out ? '', 
  to which the goral answers `` i will '' . 
  rounds come and go and each time the coach asks whether the goral will hold out , and he confirms every time , bloodied and bruised as he is . 
  then , just before round ten , the coach asks again and the goral says : `` nah , now i 'll fuck him up proper '', 
   a woman comes to see a doctor , and she 's got a frog on her head . 
  the doctor asks `` what 's the matter ? '', 
  the frog answers : `` something 's stuck to my arse '', 
  that the allies did , indeed . 
  why are those people poor then ? 
  are they paid less ? 
  this polish humor , no fight , no nazi , no bad , pleees undrestend . 
  i thank you for your voice . 
  you make an important point : merely thinking something is not a legal issue ( albeit there is the category of `` hate crimes '' ) , it 's a cultural issue . 
  then we agree on the diagnosis of what should be the way forward : look beyond the immediate problem , solve the source issue ( s ) . 
  i am happy that there is a consensus between us . 
  i have to disagree on one thing , though . 
  what / r/europe is giving us , is not just `` it 's not our responsibility '' assholes ( besides , show some empathy , put yourself in their shoes - can you see the reasons , which i dare argue do go beyond purely selfish ones , for their attitude ? ) . 
  i see a lot of smart points being raised . 
  after being told for a long time that it 's not okay to talk about some things , people are starting to talk and this is emboldening more people to come forward with their views . 
  absolutely , some of them are outrageous and beyond human dignity - but that is to be expected . 
  that / r/europe is focusing on the immediate aspect of the refugee and migrant question just at this moment can only be a reflection of the immediacy felt . 
  as we say in polish `` bli\u017csza koszula cia\u0142u , ni\u017c [ sukmana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukmana ) '' ( literally `` the shirt 's closer to the body than the coat '' ) : the immediate needs are dealt with first . 
  i dare say europeans are not exasperatingly different in this regard than anybody else ( on some general abstract level ) , are they ? 
  you will excuse me for making what you may perhaps perceive as pointless or redundant statements - i am merely making those for the sake of clarity . 
  i absolutely agree that apart from addressing the effects currently being experienced , we need to address the root-causes for the migrant flood . 
  the syrian war is just a small fragment of the picture , but we must n't forget about climate refugees , of which there will be more and more . 
  that is the tragedy of the situation : it is so complex , and the scale is so mind-numbing that too many people fail to recognise the issue ; it really is the elephant in the room , albeit we 've grown accustomed to tip-toeing past it and this needs to change . 
  as for putting myself in the shoes of refugees : i have tried that and yes , i very well can imagine what it means for them . 
  i would also like them to put themselves in our shoes : as more and more arrive , they 'll have to have less and less say in where they end up . 
  lastly , i am not pinning the isis and the syrian war on the us , there is far more to pin on the us ( and to some extent the uk and their perhaps sometimes instrumentally used nato allies , including poland ) , but this is a topic for a different discussion entirely . 
  i remember a canadian consul ( or ambassador , was it ? ), 
  visiting my university some dozen years ago , or so , and talking about immigration models , on the example of the american approach and contrasting it with the canadian approach . 
  as a young person more stupid than i am now , i could only claim to have had a partial comprehension of what he really meant . 
  it was n't until the last three years that i begun to appreciate what it was and now i see the local ( as in the city and [ voivodeship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voivodeship ) level ) government beginning to act on that wisdom , inspired by the tireless work of self-sacrificing local ngos . 
  there is one problem , though : something that 's always ( well , at least in terms of post-communist times , since the [ balcerowicz plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balcerowicz_plan ) , which was inspired by the [ chicago school of economics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicago_school_of_economics ) , which i personally find to be in large parts economic fundamentalism ) been proverbially lacking in poland , money . 
  edit : thankfully , as part of the eu now , there 's hope that we can rely on the eu funds in that regard - provided the eu is not over-saturated with people needing urgent integration , as the eu 's coffers are , obviously , not limitless . 
  you can talk of patience if you can manage the situation . 
  i think we should talk of action , if situation is spiralling out of control ( which , you 'll have noted , several politicians from merkel 's coalition party alone have admitted ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not talking action in the ominous final solution kind of way , no . 
  we need a frank realisation that we ca n't help everyone . 
  can we still help more people ? 
  most likely yes , but not if they all come in flooding at the same time . 
  callous though it may be , the wave will have to be stopped at some point , so that we may re-assess the situation and rally further resources , if they 'll be available . 
  the information campaigns in the source countries that 's being started by several governments ( germany , denmark - i believe ? , etc. 
  ) : these people need to have a realistic expectation of what they can find here , not a fairy-tale dream . 
  another aspect is the anti-smuggler operation that is in the talks now , albeit it looks like it 'll be a half-hearted effort . 
  migration and integration will only be manageable if it 's a process in time , not a flash-pan fire like here . 
  like you said - time , resources , patience ; these things will increase the chance of success . 
  uncontrolled waves of unprocessed people who refuse to be processed , throwing crazed tantrums , and are picky in terms of where they can get the best money for free are draining on the europeans ' good-will and stalling real , meaningful and good ( objectively , given the awfulness of the situation ) progress . 
  eventually , maybe the world will muster enough courage to speak frankly with the americans about their economic , political and , unfortunately , military foot-print on the whole world , and whether it 's helping or harming the bigger picture . 
  when was it announced that the rules will be changed ? 
  and how has clauzel broke the rules ? 
  panic ? 
  no , me - i 'm [ comfortably numb ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isr9-43-z9o ) . 
  peace be with you . 
  i hear you , thanks for the clarification . 
  i was going off / u/bird _ person_forever 's post : madrid 's earlier `` subjugation '' of catalonia ( apologies if this is not the term to use , it was prompted by the phrase `` unwilling subjects '' ) and franco 's banning of the catalan language . 
  apologies if i misconstrued and misrepresented . 
  whilst the catalonian people should never forget , i would like to ask whether it 's worth forgiving ( forgiving castillia , not franco ) ? 
  out of curiosity : sentenced to prison on what charges , exactly ? 
  assault and battery ? 
  * gross violation of a [ documentarist 's non-involvement policy ] ( https://youtu.be/mghg5mqmcm8?t=5m21s ) ( referring to that great '99 mockumentary , [ drop dead gorgeous ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drop_dead_gorgeous_ ( film ) , which - contrary to what reviews , which were not unlikely sabotaged by the us beauty pageant industry , would have you believe - is a film i found hilarious and well-worth seeing ) * ? 
  ( sorry , could n't resist ), 
  * le toppe keque !, 
  just [ do n't act surprised ] ( http://www.internal-displacement.org/global-figures ) as more and more factors increase the pressure beyond breaking point . 
  in the words of the frighteningly lucid aaron sorkin , [ a person has already been born that will die due to a catastrophic failure of the planet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm0uz9mfoui ) what the mass media are comfortable with showing you ( however uncomfortable it may be ) is but a tip of the iceberg . 
  this is partly also related to the fact that many people simply can not comprehend the scale of what we are witnessing and how woefully inadequate the response has been . 
  lack of administrative and organisational capacity to even perfunctorily integrate these millions of people - and no , i do n't mean just the idps from the link above on the demographic flows front - and never ending vacillation on commitment to meaningful action on climate change mitigation , etc. 
  perhaps the inadequacy has not been accidental . 
  [ perhaps we never saved anything for the swim back . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/gm-znjdgube?t=2m41s ) question is - will it have been worth it , what we find on the other shore , if we ever reach it ? 
  edit : updated link to idmc to better reflect what i had meant . 
  one good move at a time , belatedly . 
  will it avert the worst ? 
  wait and see , wait and see . 
  edit : that article though . 
  written by a drunkard hurried on by an illiterate editor , was it ? 
  and boy , have i in recent days and weeks come across more recondite news sites than i could ever want to .
