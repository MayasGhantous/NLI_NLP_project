  i 'll look into what happened to those entities .

  are you suggesting the us are specifically targeting ukrainians ? 
  not since 1994 . 
  i remember an article in a gaming magazine when that bill was made law with an interview with two guys who made their living trading on software exchanges . 
  i also remember going almost weekly to such soft exchanges with my dad , that 's how i was exposed to the demo scene and the kick-ass amiga graphics ( i had a zx spectrum and later a 286 with cga at the time ) .

  it 's the euthanasia factor . 
  are you two quite done straw-manning or will you continue for some time yet ? 
  let me clarify - you are not , naturally , putting words in my mouth and implying that i 'd say something like `` how dare they go to gay parades and complain about discrimination '' . 
  now , personally , i think those parades , they way things here are , do more net harm than good , but it 's not up to me to stop people attending from doing precisely that . 
  i am not a homosexual person and i ca n't pretend to understand them better than they themselves . 
  as for your second point - while i know of at least two cases when someone 's coming out coincided with breaking up contact with their parents , i know several others where they get along perfectly well . 
  so - tough luck for your friends , i guess . 
  a few of the ones i know seem to be able to get along and live happily enough , with the odd hiccup perhaps . 
  some of the others , those who feel the need to go to gay parades - yes , they seem much more vocal about the insufferableness of living here . 
  by the by , is your arse all okay , what with laughing it off and all that ? 
  i agree , the problem with hools and dumb knuckle-heads is that they all too often choose completely irrational rationales for senseless violence . 
  truth be told , in the past years i 've been observing something genuinely puzzling to me here in poland - a negative sentiment towards the elderly . 
  there 's been a resentment towards older people for many years now , based on the association of old people with [ radio maryja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_maryja ) , and pis and their ( not infrequently dramatically ) conservative stances . 
  during the 2007 pre-term elections called for due to the collapse of the pis-lpr-samoobrona coalition , there was this prank call to `` take away your grandma 's id '' [ `` zabierz babci dow\u00f3d '' ; thus making her ineligible to vote , due to being unable to prove her identity ] , a prank that became a - i dare say - popular call . 
  from what i can gather , the author of the slogan later disavowed it when the prosecution took interest in him , but the way i remember it , it was definitely a common sentiment among young people . 
  then you have the traditional ( i.e. 
  i 've been hearing them in mid-90s , and i 'm hearing them in mid-10s ) complaints from youngsters about old people taking up seats in public transport - complaining about the fact that old people even use public transport that much ( aged 70 and over it 's free to them , with an id as proof of age ) . 
  it 's skirting the territory between a joke and genuine resentment and i do n't quite like that , how commonly i hear it and with what words of disrespect . 
  on the other hand , i still do see people give up their seats to elders , so there 's that as well . 
  it 's a far cry from outright euthanasia soylent-green-style , but i agree that the way our current economic model is set up it unnecessarily pits the young vs the old and i feel all they 're doing is taking cue from the system . 
  poland 's recent government got more young votes than the rival party , so . 
  in fact , it got [ more votes across all age groups ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/wybory-jak-glosowali-mlodzi-a-inni-wyborcy,589048.html ) . 
  ( `` wiek '' is `` age '' and then you have the age groups ; `` wykszta\u0142cenie '' is `` education '' ; `` miejscowo\u015b\u0107 '' is `` place of living '' according to size , in thousands ; `` p\u0142e\u0107 '' is `` sex '' ; the last group is to do with profession ], 
  nah , not even po in earnesty . 
  i mean , they went through the motions of appearing to agree to the refugee quotas , but they did n't really want it . 
  i mean , ewa kopacz , then-pm was really at a loss on how to stop the sinking voters ' support so even though she was going through the motions , she was sending messages to potential voters that refugees are a no-no ( all those - `` we 'll carefully check the refugees '' , `` we 'll take christians first '' , etc. ) . 
  and the resettlements you 're referring to , i believe , were run by an ngo run by a [ syrian woman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miriam_shaded ) ( not muslim though ) . 
  i did n't assume that . 
  you just reminded me of that situation and back then i found it funny when i wondered whether if someone looked at that rejected candidate from the outside , would they see anti-semitism , or would they see a lack of qualification ? 
  i still find it funny when i imagine someone frothing at the mouth at the perceived anti-semitism of that incident ; hopefully it 'll be just imaginings , because who would be so silly as to call that anti-semitism ? 
  bit short-tempered , are n't you ? 
  arguably , the previous government also stole money from the retirement funds , so . 
  `` late '' does n't mean what you think it means . 
  both these women are still alive . 
  `` former '' is probably what you wanted to use , except when in reference to mrs duda . 
  i once rejected an american jew for a job . 
  was it anti-semitism , or was it because i did n't think he had the qualifications for it and i had better candidates in mind ? 
  white women are also generally safe , no worries . 
  homosexuals as well , unless they make a point of pointing out their sexuality to football hools and the like . 
  no , actually , not . 
  it 's a rather universal stance across the political spectrum - only for votes in many cases , though . 
  i suppose some fringe parties - like the * razem * , who 've failed to secure any mps - do have a welcoming stance ( i think , / u/solewanderer - fact check ? 
  ~ ~ a small nitpick here - when they show the combined coat of arms , it 's the polish eagle that should be looking to the heraldic right ; the german eagle is twin-headed , so it would make no difference whether they 'd show the german eagle 's right-looking head ( as they have ) or the left-looking head . 
  but showing a left-looking polish eagle distorts the national coat of arms . 
  i get it that - i suppose - the idea was to show that germany is to the west , while poland is to the east , but i 'm not okay with this . ~ ~ edit : wait . 
  where did i take the twin-headed eagle from ? 
  based on the `` next be your family '' ( so a badly translated `` nast\u0119pna b\u0119dzie twoja/wasza rodzina '' ) line , i 'm also considering this as a possible explanation ( one of a few ) . 
  we 'll just have to wait and see . 
  or not . 
  this is just such low-hanging fruit , that i do n't even find any joy in this . 
  `` russian president says russian troops pulled 1500 km away from the border , expects neighbouring countries to reciprocate and threatens retortions if they fail to oblige . '', 
  `` in an unrelated piece of news , russian authorities notice a gigantic increase in tourism in the country 's border regions , with local groups of hikers marching all across the country , eager to explore the pristine russian forests . 
  one tourist , speaking on behalf of his battalion , noted that they did n't need any navigational equipment , as they knew the forests like the back of their hand . '', 
  i am somewhat intrigued by the blog this was posted on . 
  as a polish pole and the most slavic overslav of all slavs to boot , therefore an expert on all things polish and slavic , looking at the other postings on it , i feel it paints a very rational and entirely unbiased picture of poland with no agenda behind it whatsoever .

  cheers . 
  as someone who 's always had a great , inexplicable fondness of scotland , i fully support you in finding a way to turn this whole mess to your benefit . 
  well , most of them are actually migrants , not refugees ( see , so it 's exactly like the other refugees !, 
  ) , and a considerable number - i dare say the vast majority of them - have found a way to legalise their stay ( visas , work permits , etc. 
  a lot of words are of german origin .
