  equal representation is a difficult concept . 
  i , too , struggle with it , at times . 
  frankly , i 'm mostly indifferent really , but i 'm not the whole country , naturally . 
  the brain drain , it is a-real !, 
  for some reason i was reminded of this humorous picture - [ arier ] ( https://www.allmystery.de/dateien/uh67748,1294250338,arier-nicht-nur-sauber-sondern-rein.jpg ), 
  like i wrote elsewhere , no harsh feelings . 
  i am terribly sad as well , that britain may unravel before our eyes , but at the same time i am also somewhat happy for the chance scots should get - when they voted in 2014 , i would n't have staked my life on the fairness of that choice , as it was obvious to me that the uk breaking up was not a signal western europe , specifically the uk itself , was comfortable with sending to the people of donbass in ukraine , not to legitimise those breakaway regions by proxy , given how fresh it was . 
  now , with the situation in ukraine having grown stale , why , the scots might as well get a go . 
  if ireland can become united as well , well , there 'd be an upside to this whole massive conundrum ( albeit it would be at the cost of the uk as a whole ; sorry , chaps ) . 
  i suppose a very important lesson for politicians around the world is that they have to update their cynical , manipulative play-books . 
  the old manipulative tricks ( `` i 'll give you a referendum if you do n't vote ukip '' ) are less effective in manipulating the easily-manipulated to the desired effect ( which is contradictory to the original message of the manipulation ) , because social media and the internet now mean there are far more actors manipulating a greater number of the easily-manipulated , and it 's a lot easier for the easily-manipulated to coordinate their ( misguided ) efforts - something that was previously the sole purview of those with access ( and control ) of the mass media . 
  hope , it dies last , dunnit . 
  no harsh feelings , really . 
  good luck with whatever you 'll have . 
  but you have to understand that a hard stance toward the uk is now going to be a reflex action from the eu , i believe . 
  such are the political necessities , the way i understand them . 
  that 's cool . 
  but calling older people `` coffin dodgers '' in a show of anger following a referendum decision you disagree with is poor form , from where i 'm sitting . 
  i admire your confidence and complacence . 
  regarding your paragraph about shortcomings of democracy - well , that 's the thing about a universal democracy where everyone gets a vote , is n't it ? 
  it does n't matter how educated or uneducated ; how smart or stupid ; how altruistic or selfish ; how emotional or clear-thinking ; how young or old ; how rich or poor you are . 
  it does n't matter whether you 're a man or a woman ; employed or unemployed ; whether you care or not . 
  naturally , being some of those things increases your chances of influencing others ; the rich and the mighty might influence others who would aspire to being so themselves ; the outspoken among the poor and the downtrodden might influence others who 'll feel their complaints have been given a voice to - and it wo n't matter whether truthfully or not . 
  so - to me - democracy as it is is a terribly frail and easily manipulated system , even assuming there are no ballot manipulations . 
  how respectful . 
  and how long exactly do you intend to live and when are you going to be ready to relinquish your voting powers come older age ? 
  right from what point of view ? 
  the beggar-thyself-and-thy-neighbour point of view ? 
  then perhaps right indeed . 
  any other point of view ? 
  highly , highly contestable . 
  the stream , though . 
  while the initial `` panic-mode '' reactions were a given , i suppose , we 'll start seeing some real implications once the dust settles . 
  the real question on my mind , however , is how does england ascertain scotland 's ( for one ) continued participation in the united kingdom . 
  who have you heard that rhetoric from , do tell ? 
  you 're right , most likely , but i 'm not surprised . 
  i was amused by the mental image of soviet veterans sprouting off more veterans through a budding process . 
  with 84 percent saying `` yes '' in 2001 and 85 percent saying `` yes '' in 2016 ), 
  and here , it seems , we can largely agree ( leaving the semantics of whether what the ussr and nazi germany had was an alliance or was n't aside , as this is what you were referring to when you wrote of `` alliance '' , i assume ? 
  ) , of which i am extremely glad . 
  kind regards from poland . 
  so do n't call it `` exactly the same '' when you yourself admit it was n't . 
  there were some similarities , yes , just as there are similarities between the colours black and white , and the apple and the orange , but do you still feel right in justifying soviet invasion of poland in accordance with their deal with nazi germany with what poland did in 1938 , when the situation was - to my eyes - rather different ? 
  so - was it `` exactly the same thing '' or was it `` in many respects very similar '' . 
  you 're vacillating , tsk tsk . 
  oh , goodie , goodie , i can try it out !, 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet\u2013polish_non-aggression_pact ), 
  well , `` exactly the same thing '' is a bit of a stretch , me thinks , would n't you agree , my montenegrin friend ? 
  i mean - if poland was `` stealing its piece '' , did we have a pre-arranged deal with germany , like the soviet union did ( the ribbentrop-molotov pact ) ? 
  further - was czechoslovakia fighting a defensive war against germany , which war effort was undermined by poland taking over the contested zaolzie territory after the czechoslovakian government yielded to the polish ultimatum ? 
  because i think a case could be made for saying that poland in september 1939 was fighting a defensive war against germany , which war effort was undermined by the soviet union entering polish territory without a declaration of war . 
  by the way , out of curiosity - do we have a photograph of polish soldiers shaking hands with germans , [ like so ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/spotkanie_sojusznik\u00f3w.jpg ) ? 
  cheers !, 
  each week . 
  now shut up , and put up the dosh . 
  this . 
  you were under the absolutely wrong impression . 
  from its government to a sizeable number - if not outright majority - of the citizens here , we 're pro-eu . 
  might i recommend al stewart 's [ `` roads to moscow '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baqp35a9oi8 ) for those who do n't know it ? 
  shame for me , good for them , i guess . 
  where are the lesbians ? 
  i want some lesbians , please . 
  conventionally aesthetically pleasing , please . 
  it was not exactly a choice left entirely to me . 
  but for those who were making the choice , it was either the previous evil empire , or the new one , with strings attached . 
  i guess someone figured that since the us is yonder over the horizon , across the pond , they 'd meddle less . 
  so far it 's generally true , so there 's at least that . 
  well , true , at least around europe , you 're not * that * evil . 
  you think ? 
  good point ; wife loved it , even if it meant we were face-palming at the thought of what djupvik would do in that day 's episode . 
  they work in different ways , it 's true . 
  no , truth be told - funny how memory works - the prisons appear to have been in operation in 2002-2003 , so during sld 's rule - who 've since become a political non-entity in poland . 
  later on donald tusk , as head of po 's government , in 2013 wanted to classify the proceedings of the strassburg court on this case , which motion was rejected . 
  poland lost the case and a palestinian and a saudi nationals who had sued were awarded damages . 
  [ psst ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4p40aa/european_states_collusion_with_the_cia/d4hwdxy ), 
  thanks for the context . 
  the film [ `` essential killing '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0cr2n4xbfq ) by skolimowski was inspired by ( then - in 2009 when it was produced/2010 when it came out - yet unproven ) allegations of poland participating in cia 's `` extraordinary rendition '' and imprisonment programmes . 
  ( if i were out to score points in the benign form of civil war currently taking place in poland , i 'd point out that 2009/2010 , when the allegations were circulating , was during po 's rule . 
  human rights , democracy , those kinds of buzz words . 
  but i 'm not that kind of a person , am i ? ), 
  it 's shameful that we 've ditched the soviets , only to became thralls to the other evil empire . 
  i am glad you derived some amusement from my subjective summary of the series . 
  have you watched it as well ? 
  do you dispel the notion that it may have been far-fetched and steeped in an unrealistic political fantasy ? 
  while there are some parallels between what happened in 2014 and later in ukraine , and what happened in hungary in 1956 , i think the situations were altogether two distinct phenomena and happened in rather different circumstances . 
  that is not to take away anything from the magyars ' rejection of the rule that was imposed on them following wwii . 
  kind regards from poland . 
  yes , in an ideal world state-level hypocrisy would not take place . 
  in an ideal world , states would n't have to approach other states as `` rivals '' . 
  in perhaps a slightly better world , there would be more mutual respect between both states , and ordinary people . 
  perhaps in a better world we could all go through some sort of amnesia-event and forget the shit everyone 's always digging up from the past ; alternatively , we could find the strength to ditch the habit of justifying new shit with the old one . 
  one can dream . 
   \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 wastepaper , more like , or `` paper for recycling '' if we want to be fancy . 
  i 'd say the humour in this one is quite recondite . 
  well , i 'd say that 's consistent behaviour for russia . 
  condemn others , do it themselves . 
  you know , the whole `` do as i say , not as i do '' thing ? 
  i can definitely get well behind that summary . 
  frankly , the series was shite to me . 
  boring , predictable , forced , far-fetched , i could go on .
