  so close , so close !, 
  that was too recondite for me . 
  makes some sense , in that case . 
  get a room you two , sheesh . 
  not a man ?!, 
  ** downvote for you !, 
  to the nether pits with you , whence you came from , you progeny of the first ally of the serpent , you !, 
  austria 's ally is austria ? 
  bit schizophrenic , innit ? 
  no further questions , your honour . 
  verily ? 
  the above puerile vernacular may have been prompted by my mind still reeling from the discovery i made earlier today - that of the so-called [ `` trap '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trap_music ) music , which had been mentioned to me by a considerably younger member of our glorious populace , which i - as information-addicted sophomaniacs such as me are wont to do - in my never-ending quest for discovery and enlightenment had to investigate . 
  suffice to say , i was later lead to such masterpieces of contemporary culture as [ `` turn down for what '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmudvmiitou ) , which in turn reminded me of the fact that ninja and \u00a5 o-landi , whom i had seen in the film `` chappie '' , were not just names of characters from aforementioned movie , but actual handles real people in the real fucking world use in reference to themselves , which ended with me stumbling upon [ `` i fink u freeky '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uee_mcxvrw ) . 
  now . 
  where the utter and complete fuck have we taken the wrong turn on our way here again ? 
  shiz , dat a mad burn .

  ( til the fourth international is a thing ), 
  moving goalposts , are we ? 
  banana . 
  ( i thought we were discussing the english version of the word used to denote the countries ; additionally , there are `` short '' country names and `` official '' country names - if you insist on `` the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' , then you should also be okay with `` the czech republic '' ... oh , my , what a pickle we 've run ourselves into ), 
  it is my understanding that traditionally the uk is also called `` gro\u00dfbritannien '' in german . 
  actually - czechia . 
  i thought the nickname looked familiar . 
  might i ask approximately when you joined the moderation team at / r/polska ? 
  are you an activist for some organisation , or is it just your personal convictions ? 
  so , the media have found their narrative-legs for this tournament ? 
  sorry france , the pr cost will be stupendous , as if terror attacks were not enough already . 
  i was somewhat miffed my pure , aesthetic enjoyment of the finely shaped female form in lingerie that a considerable segment of this scene consisted of was marred by her uncouth behaviour , but at least it was relatively amusing , i 'll grant it that . 
  precisely . 
  well , there are those bothersome details that 'd need to be sorted out first . 
  like who 'd be the aggressor , and how would the un be placated or side-stepped , or what to do about the back-lash , things like that . 
  well , i guess a prudent tourist would do their research before going somewhere : is it safe ( for someone like me ) ? 
  are the laws there drastically different than what i 'm accustomed to ? 
  i mean , it 'd be a bit nonchalant to waltz into north korea in a seth rogen t-shirt , i imagine . 
  what about a possible counter-point , conveniently just above poland - portugal ? 
  not the bail-out greece and a country much smaller than poland in terms of populace , how is their economic performance to be interpreted - genuine question ? 
  that was positively antoin de saint-exupery , the quote , it was . 
  is this a prong of the brexit campaign as well , because i got confused ? 
  cheers . 
  i used to keep in touch with a few finns i met through a 2d side-scrolling shooter called `` soldat '' way back when and they never gave me the impression of being as socially awkward as depicted in these comics , that 's why i could n't contain my amazement ( maybe they were just masquerading really well ) . 
  okay ? 
  that must be super awkward for you , no ? 
  there was something about that sneaky pole and i could n't put me finger on it - until now . 
  he reminds me of [ mysterious don pedro , the spy from the land of rainmen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1osn-s7gvs ) from the animated serial `` the kidnapping of balthasar sponge '' , the way he moves . 
  seriously , how accurate are these ? 
  are any of them like real real ? 
  like really real real ? 
  seriously ?? 
  in poland there are normal and `` on demand '' stops . 
  if you 're standing on one of the latter , you wave for the bus to stop - or you press the stop button to signal the driver you want to get off if you 're on the bus . 
  for normal stops - all regular buses stop there ( with maybe night lines being an exception , since often with night lines all stops are treated as `` on demand '' ) . 
  but you 'd have to do it bear-chested . 
  cheers !, 
  nice one . 
  i 'm assuming you 're using some third party suite for the tagging part ? 
  res ? 
  how 's that working out for you - no complaints ? 
  well , you 're trying to tell / u / - plastic - that you do n't agree his is a good idea . 
  indirectly suggesting that he 's stupid might not really change his mind - and he appears to be rather certain of his position . 
  you 're wasting the opportunity to engage in dialogue and possibly make it plain to all around why `` colonialism 2.0 '' would not be a good idea , which is important - since there are people who think it is . 
  refute the points , then , instead of admonishing the poster indirectly . 
  [ ekhm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_european_heat_wave ) . 
  this reminds me of that time when i may have triggered an older german gentleman when he said `` morgen '' in the camping bathroom on a fine niedersachsen morn , and i replied `` dzie\u0144 dobry '' . 
  he appeared to be somewhat perplexed . 
  frankly , the first segment ( before what 's been linked to ) is a bit better . 
  when that other guy comes in , he quickly manages to deflate the humour . 
  hear , hear !, 
  nurses , not nuns , where you talk of `` nuns and doctors '' , i imagine . 
  i do , i do , i 've heard . 
  ( though i 'd just like to point out that the mr. poland synecdoche is unwarranted , because that is risking a grossly simplified generalisation ), 
  i think they may have taken their clue from the church of besieged on all sides by black-homo-nazi-jewdom of the usa&e . 
  thanks , putin !, 
  definitely not . 
  `` in 1995 he murdered headmaster phillipe l [ ... ] , who was stabbed to death in 1995 after going to help one of his pupils . '' ? 
  holy redundant adverbials , batman !, 
  that 'll be the day when i see a pole whose first name is `` arqr '' . 
  ( unless that 's his street-handle they 're giving us , which would still be uncanny ; a safe bet is to say his first name is `` artur '' ) that 's unreadable !, 
  the swiss , not the swedes , i thought . 
  you goin ' down like a lead zeppelin !, 
  yep , that 's what [ the polish media reported ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/swiat/news-obywatel-francji-zatrzymany-na-granicy-polsko-ukrainskiej-mi,nid,2213578#utm_source=paste&amp;utm_medium=paste&amp;utm_campaign=firefox ) . 
  held with aks , rpgs and 100 kg of explosives . 
  are there any plans for a possible crusader kings 2 , or hearts of iron iv spin-off ? 
  ever reliable in your contempt , always full of turkophobia and eu-phobia . 
  it 's good to know there are some constants in life . 
  cheers . 
  begun the lithuanian bargain wars have !, 
   even in germany i liked this part . 
  til italy is now a muslim country . 
  is the pope in danger ? 
  i guess his ecumenical stance has a darker undertone to it . 
  good point . 
  no , i do n't . 
  it looks like we 're going to have to do something about the us of a and the drone strikes that are driving refugees out of pakistan . 
  asylum seekers from pakistan ? 
  do they know something we do n't about a coming war with india , or what ? 
  i did n't . 
  i do n't have a fedora . 
  czech mate , germany , czech mate .
