  shut your tortillaface , you gaspacho !, 
  durex , sedulex , as ancient greeks were wont to say , as per the famous habibi penal code . 
  flashback monday to june 2016 ? 
  no more 2016 , please . 
  thank you . 
  it 's an arsehole . 
  arseholes are like opinions , they can be obnoxious . 
  true that , slipped my mind . 
  how about scheduling elections on sundays , which is a day off for everyone anyway ? 
  ( well , it does n't seem to be working , considering it 's the way things are set up in poland and electoral turn-outs have been going from bad to worse ), 
  you and your rose-tinted glasses again . 
  black , the colour should be black . 
  the answer is 42 , but apart from that - orbital strikes . 
  back to ye goode olde firebrandin ' , those rascals went to , aye !, 
  buka . 
  i had literally no idea . 
  russian suitcase nukes , must be . 
  i think it 's french , actually . 
  krecik oksywie fan-club represent !, 
  hear hear !, 
  i would of if i could of , but their is was a direct reason for my comment : i had he 's comment in my site , so i could n't just let go . 
  martial , from mars , the ancient roman god of war . 
  a man 's got ta eat . 
  that 's the joke . 
  well , how about you [ gloss over the first 12 pages or so ] ( http://earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/pubs/brookings0990.pdf ) and tell me whether `` rapid privatisation '' seems to imply any measure of comprehensiveness ? 
  looks like she means it , what with the fist slamming . 
  careful there with your russophobia . 
  your russian visa has been rescinded . 
  pizza is okay , right ? 
  i 'd wager that it 's more of a `` no such thing as ethnic latvians '' thing . 
  nah , they are probably there just for holiday . 
  it 's just a phase . 
  `` lol '' , indeed . 
  a real killer of a joke , that one . 
  is it , though ? 
  it appears to me to be meant to ridicule walrup 's position - and by ridiculing it , weaken the argument to the point where any merit it may have becomes opaque . 
  i find your culture of debating sorely lacking . 
  i believe it prudent to write '' ** was ** happening in the heart of the european union '' , but i base this on information which immediately followed the outrage you linked to and do n't have the time now to bring up any solid evidence . 
  is that an ad hominem i see before me , sirrah ? 
  or is it a strawman ? 
  i do get confused ; say , why do n't you consult this [ handy chart ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com ) and opine as the author of the above argument yourself . 
  the title appears to be somewhat editorialised , making it in breach of the rules , no ? 
  the woman . 
  the list you linked to does indeed list it as [ 1364 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation#founded_before_1500 ) . 
  based on my inextensive knowledge of russian i would posit that maybe you confused the issue of `` g '' and `` kh '' with russian . 
  consider : hitler is '' \u0413\u0438\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0440 '' , where '' \u0413 '' is equivalent to `` g '' . 
  history is '' \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f '' , where '' \u0438 '' is an `` i '' . 
  cham , cholera - it was not the point though , it appears to me . 
  while i can generally agree with your first assertion , considering that in modern polish the two spellings are basically homophones , i would n't be so confident about the second assertion . 
  words such as `` head '' , `` home '' , `` hat '' , `` hi '' are typically amongst the first words anyone learns in english , so there can be little doubt as to the nature of the `` h '' sound ; the same is true for words like `` child '' , `` cheese '' , `` china '' , `` check '' - here again , assuming a typical student , the phonetic nature of the `` ch '' spelling is immediately evident . 
   ca n't say normal ` h ' , only g and kh i have no idea where you 're taking this from . 
  hojny ( generous ) , humor , habit ( monk 's / nun 's frock ) , hak ( hook ) , etc. 
  if we operationalise the term thus , would you say it would be equally justified to apply the term `` galactic power '' , since it would - to my eyes - also meet the criterion of a `` power when we talk about the galaxy '' ? 
  i mean , it has a nice ring to it - russia , the galactic power since the 1400s . 
  not the first galactic power , nor the first galactic empire , either , but still ( rome , off the top of my head , would be among others that could have a better claim to that title ) . 
  naturally , no one yet has the ability to project force on a galactic level , but that should n't stop us , if we choose to define the term in the above-mentioned way . 
  brz\u0119czyszczykiewicz , without the first `` i '' in your spelling . 
  european union countries , when they pool together their resources and economies , have a better bargaining position - it is implied this bargaining position would be sufficiently strong to get the deals where the eu would not be told what the deal is , but where it could well negotiate it as an equal partner at least , or even dictate it . 
  seperately , all eu countries , when their resources and economies are scattered , would have a much weaker bargaining position , meaning a scenario where they 'd be dictated what the deal is would be more likely . 
  this is my understanding of the matter ; has it helped you grasp the idea behind tusk 's words , would you say ? 
  in a word ? 
  perceived shit production values , the dragon being a case in point , that did not do the literature proper justice . 
  cruisin ' for a bruisin ' , are you , you two ? 
  well , here 's hoping you get what you asked for . 
  nor could i. i was hoping he would be more forthcoming ; sadly his elucidation has not dispelled the obscurity of his meaning . 
  which countries among the ones i listed would you consider to be throwing tantrums and what constitutes tantrums in their context ? 
  whom do switzerland 's citizens dislike and how , do you suppose , might their placidity be correlated with any possible loses of independence they may have experienced in the last , let 's say , 500 years ? 
   they dont like us much for some reason  they speaking in funny tone wait , i thought it was czechs , and now you 're telling me it 's us ? 
  i am afraid i am unsure what you mean , and i would appreciate it if you clarified . 
  regional power then , rather than world power , i take it ? 
  norway , finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland ? 
  sounds about right , do n't you think ? 
  what do you base this - to me as a lay dabbler in history - a pretty unorthodox claim on ? 
  what was russia 's global reach and influence in the 1400s ? 
  nope , i did n't use a translator for the italian words i 've listed . 
  no , that means i was joking . 
  no , i have carefully engineered my internet persona to obfuscate my nationality , but i can safely say that i am not italian without compromising the truth about my real nationality . 
  danger : potentially incendiary opinion . 
  well , it 's supposed to be free elections . 
  everyone who 's eligible has a vote and whatever rationale they apply to their vote is their matter , is it not ? 
  i 've seen people deface voting cards with pictures of , well , all sorts of different things , i 've heard of people using all sorts of - to my ears - sound and unsound logic to rationalise their election choices . 
  well , if no apparently sound option managed to convince them , it 's their vote . 
  since i 'm not currently aware of any restrictions placed on the nature of election choices , apart from countries where voting is mandatory , i guess we 'll have to leave it at that . 
  unless we 're willing to sit down and think about applying a carefully constructed - and it seems to me that it 'd have to be meticulously carefully crafted - system of how people can and can not vote and how to reconcile it with the declared free nature of elections . 
  we concur . 
  touch\u00e9 , albeit [ some argument , i imagine , could be made in favour of it being nominally * polish * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_bison#conservation ) . 
  oh , the humanity ! ... 
  speaking of which - i do n't seem to get modern french cinema much , but we recently saw * qu'est - ce qu'on a fait au bon dieu ? 
  * and there was a very real threat of my wife dying of laughter . 
  narrowly avoided , but i have to say , it was a pretty amusing film . 
  somehow reminded me of de funes . 
  `` gdy ch\u0142op baby nie bije , to jej w\u0105troba gnije '' ( polish : when a man does n't beat his woman , her liver rots '' ) . 
  oh , stop you ... ( swooning ), 
  [ information ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krzy\u017ctop\u00f3r ) . 
  savage . 
  auschwitz is a word from which language ? 
  / u/civcraftian , what a vigorous cyber-trollmando . 
  precisely . 
  whoa . 
  whoa .
