  what is your experience ? 
  care to explain the context and the message in more detail , as i 'm struggling to interpret it as pertaining to my post ? 
  next time you find an unattended package - you react , or you do n't ? 
  next time you hear shots and see someone you deem suspicious - you react or you do n't ? 
  etc. , etc. 
  you 've blown our secret plan !, 
  run before they get y, 
  the hairdo does n't flatter her in my eyes , but the face conveys a certain beauty . 
  should definitely visit once again and for longer , because a brief one-day excursion to prague in high school just does n't cut it , does it ? 
  and that 's the problem . 
  because frankly , i could say the same to you . 
  but instead of trying to reconcile an obvious difference , you choose lack of dialogue and lack of solution . 
  what happened in the parliament is no fairy tale and there are no good guys who 've been wronged by the bad guys . 
  there is some truth in expressing concern over the independence of media , given pis 's previous conduct , but we should also remember po 's conduct in this respect and that they 're at a loss as to how to become a constructive opposition and the only thing they can achieve is being a total , non-constructive opposition that stages such publicity stunts when they knew clearly what the point of the session was . 
  if they had n't derailed the proceedings with this trumped up pretext , the governing party would not have passed the budget by the crook they have . 
  do n't get me wrong , the way the budget was voted for is hair-raising and is the bigger issue here , and given the political context the situation between the governing party and the opposition , to me , has unfortunately devolved into some us cops vs blacks situation . 
  what it started with , however , was the question of media access to the parliament building and it does not appear to me that the proposed changes were entirely out of line . 
  where i personally prefer conflict avoidance and conflict resolution , the opposition seems to seek conflict escalation and the budget vote is what we got as a result . 
  personally i 'm nearing the point where the urge to go out in the street and protest becomes stronger than patience ( or complacence ) . 
  to protest against the law and orders disregard of law , but also to protest against all the politicians inability to work as a pluralistic governing body . 
  are we able to answer the two questions i posited , or do we not have enough data ? 
  i am sorry if you took those questions as ignoring the political context and the historical conduct of the party in question . 
  it was not my intention to imply it in any way with my questions , if you feel i did . 
  my intention in positing those questions was to establish whether the changes are in line with other western countries , as has been suggested a few time previously , or whether they were significantly different . 
  to avoid further misunderstanding , can you perhaps briefly present the relevant political context and examples of historical conduct pertaining to the situation of wanting to regulate how the media operate in government buildings akin to the manner it is being done in other western countries ? 
  i just want to be clear on your reasons that make a certain solution unacceptable in the polish context , where it appears to function in other western contexts . 
  incidentally , the summary you point us to appears to be much more focused on trivialities and publicity stunts . 
  you are asking us to look at a smoke-screen , when the nature of the conflict , it appears to me , stemmed from the opposition trying to derail the budget vote with the pretence of media being silenced . 
  and , as has been brought up several times in this thread already , media are not necessarily being silenced more than they are in other european countries , so - to me - this confirms my assessment that the opposition were grasping at straws in wanting to ramp up controversy , while going against the agenda of the last session of the parliament for the year . 
  once again , after a cursory overview of the facts of the matter as presented here and in your overview , as well as in comparisons of the intended changes for how media will operate in the parliament with how it works elsewhere ( apologies for not having seen all the broadcasts and tweets and streams and news reports ) , i shall lean towards the summary presented by / u/trenescese , rather than the one offered by / u/elslovako , as a more accurate attempt at objectivity . 
  however , i fully appreciate i may have been manipulated , and i hope you will take the opportunity to elucidate me and show me where the summary errs and how it errs , without resorting to name calling and decrying it as `` demagoguery '' without offering an explanation . 
  can you explain how calling it `` european '' - provided that the criterion of closer alignment with standards for other european parliaments and government buildings is met - is not a value-neutral description , because the point is not clear to me ? 
  thank you in advance . 
  do western countries regulate press access to politicians inside government buildings in a stricter way than it to date took place in poland ? 
  will the new regulations be considerably stricter and more limiting for the press than what is common in western countries ? 
  why has putin failed to rectify the issue of the constitution for all those years ? 
  so they did want to be cut to pieces , after all . 
  well , like i said , jerries better oblige this time round , if that 's the only message that gets through to those thick-skulled troglodytes . 
  where are those statistics available from ? 
  am i correct assuming that the 2016 figure for january-october is compared against the whole 2015 , or should i understand it 's compared against a similar period in 2015 ? 
  ( thanks . 
  has putin already hacked my computer after i accessed the xls file , or will the malware activate only after a certain time has elapsed ? ), 
  was it a sealed , water-proof bucket ? 
  you know , to make sure the offering is unsullied by some evil-wishing spirits ? 
  source ? 
  does the figure often change significantly between november and december ? 
  yes , i get what you 're saying and it 's making some sense . 
  what i wrote i wrote in jest , seeing whether you 'd respond . 
  what i 'm wondering about is the mental process that must have been going through their heads that made them do what they did , seeing as how you point out this was not a normal thing to be expected from them . 
  are you saying they may have done that because they wanted to be cut into pieces ? 
  well , i guess jerries better be more accommodating this time round , ca n't fail these expectations again now , can we ? 
   it may sound like a contrived tourist gimmick that besieges a ** small polish city ** with miniature cartoonish characters this i found odd , considering that wroc\u0142aw is the [ 4th biggest city in poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_and_towns_in_poland ) . 
  it may be a small city that happens to be in poland , globally-speaking , but it 's definitely not a small polish city , i dare say . 
  mr. ziobra ? 
  do you know something we do n't ? 
  ziobro . 
  international significance . 
  or is it ? 
  have you reported it ? 
  or maybe it only hides the post for you when you 're logged in , but the post itself otherwise stays on the sub . 
  either way , we do n't talk about things we do n't talk about in here , we use [ that other place ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/ ) for that . 
   never met one i guess that 's the operative part . 
  it 's really a wonder , how their societies live in parallel and interact with ours in such negative ways by a strange self-reinforcing mixture of choice and circumstance . 
  i 've seen some people really go out of their way to help some of the roma living locally as part of an ngo 's activities and like clockwork they 'd be disenchanted by the non-reciprocal attitude . 
  so most err on the side of caution and , well , the pariahs continue with their ways . 
  well , then you clearly have n't met me , rrawr , hear me roar !, 
  i eat jewish babies with a special kind of brrrread ( a peculiar anti-matzo , if you will ) !, 
  not that many muslims to express their opinion , i guess . 
  what 'll never cease to amaze me is how long this took . 
  did it really have to take since october to prepare envelopes with proper glue for the postal vote ? 
  i wonder how far up the ranking of longest election debacles does this rank . 
  a wild unsubstantiated claim appeared : globalisation has come to putin 's troll factories and the home-grown state-supported industry has now been outsourced to puerile brats in macedonia ; they even beat out indians !, 
  seriously though . 
  it 'd be interesting for some peer reviewed research quantifying the impact this has had to come out . 
  on the other hand , woe betide us , if it 's that easy to baffle millions and millions of people . 
  shame . 
  no first past the post silliness , if that 's what you 're asking about . 
  but seriously , good news . 
  hopefully , the proliferation of dash-cams , among other measures , shall force people to change their mentality and thing 'll get better . 
  maybe a spontaneous catholic varg vikernes shall emerge to burn down this transgression against the king ? 
  i 'm not blaming you , so no worries . 
  ... meaning `` god bless '' and `` praised be jesus christ '' ( `` now and forevermore . 
  amen ! '' ) . 
  which option applies to religious people . 
  i 'd say it 's passing rare to experience it from 20 and 30 year olds , at least those i happen to know . 
  spain has a lower subscription rate than most other western countries . 
  they do n't have internet ? 
  see what i did there ? 
   so let 's have a hypothetical scenario of ** all ** following points it seems this is the assumption for this one hypothetical scenario ; an assumption of all the points happening in that one single scenario . 
  the pivotal sentence of the article comes right at the end , where the author reveals that :  * several suppliers of army equipment contribute to my think tank and/or are consulting clients .

  out of curiosity , can you point me to an example of you shitting on islam , for reference ?
