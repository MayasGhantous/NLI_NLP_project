  [ and you ca n't forgive if you do n't forget ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4atpja2vx5g ) . 
  i knew i could n't have been the only one who noticed the discrepancy . 
  right ? 
  right ? 
  talk about self-hate in those [ semitic people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semitic_languages ) , if the distance between `` shalom aleichem '' and `` assalamu alaikum '' is so great that they engage in anti-semitism themselves . 
  small wonder some ca n't take the internal pressure and blow up ? 
  number 7 would like to have a word with you . 
  tell that to the koreans and the koreans ; the germans and the germans ( edit : from before the fall of the wall , i mean ) ; the tommies and the krauts ( edit : whose monarchs were related , after all ) ; and all the others i may have forgotten . 
  it can be literally the same culture , but as long as one ruling entity controlling a country is in conflict with other , separate ruling entities and those other ruling entities are known to be hostile to the first one , it does n't matter for the utilitarian purpose of controlling the information war . 
  that it is sad is not in contention . 
  conflict in the form of war , in general , is sad . 
  [ poland . 
  well , i believe it 's rather common that countries in a state of conflict ( for instance : war , separation of country into two hostile states ) ban their citizens from listening ( watching ) foreign broadcasts , since they 're keen to limit the amount of hostile propaganda their citizens are likely to ingest . 
  whether citizens observe that ban is a different matter . 
  it is n't north of poland , it is north poland . 
  [ der trabi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trabant ) , plus the rv . 
  alright . 
  ourougoudoubidi , man , just ourougoudoubidi . 
  did you experience this when you visited ? 
  because my experience living here and travelling around the region is not entirely consistent with yours . 
  yes , but is that still prevalent , is that dominant ? 
  is it your anecdotal experience , or is it a provable thing that you can back with sources ? 
  or a crimson tide . 
  red storm rising . 
  a real red dawn . 
  what would the `` green '' threshold be then ? 
  was that your perception of the country ? 
  what was it founded on ? 
  do you suppose that it is inconceivable for bob to want to avoid slamming their hand on a nail after seeing alfie slam their hand on a nail ? 
  is it required for bob to experience the pain - nomen omen - first-hand , for bob to understand that it is not something he desires ? 
   take also in account that most eastern european societes do not have a tradition or habit for saying what they really think . 
  source ? 
  i frequently encounter comments from foreigners stating that we 're very direct and that we speak our minds ( which i generally find to be true ) . 
  for the british : it has to be said that we continentals do n't use the term `` asian '' in the same way as you guys do . 
  `` asian '' generally refers to chinese , vietnamese , japanese and other - ese 's . 
  when was this produced ? 
  i 'm a simple man , i see a thumbnail of ievan polkka , i upvote . 
  why , yes , it was ; it was merely a prank opinion , you see ? 
  why you heff to be mad , it 's only a comment . 
  psst , psst ... 
  i had a bowl of delicious twar\u00f3g with radish and chive for breakfast with some rolls topped with delicious butter . 
  mmmhmm . 
  careful , you are entering `` calls for sedition/revolution '' territory there . 
  no , he 's trying to avoid russian counter-sanctions against the eu/us that prohibit importing many foodstuffs to russia . 
  you see , it 's because it 's not the greatest country in the world ( yet ) , that 's why it has to be made great . 
  then it 'll be easier to find on the maps . 
  i think this map was made by a pretentious and ignorant person , who may be an arsehole . 
  how do you see it ? 
  our very own forrest gump . 
  not gon na lie . 
  i 'm listening to this right now and i like what i hear very much . 
  fantastic , thank you for posting . 
  may i inquire upon what you found your certainty ? 
  `` none of you are grateful ! '', 
  i think someone 's trying to one up the stalin joke where stalin bellows at a kid on set of a tv show for something completely innocent and they cut transmission and resume shortly after with a notice that says : `` see , how merciful stalin is - he could have killed , but did n't ! '', 
  but seriously , what is the context ? 
  what was it that set him off that much and how on earth does he think himself justified in behaviour like this ? 
  because , as far as i can gather , it 's from a polish reddit-analogue , wykop.pl , and i guess it was made by one of those people who believes that if your country does anything differently than other countries , then it must be inferior ( hence the negative , red , colour ) ; and even if other countries also do that thing differently , then it 's still not the really bad kind of different ( as with iceland ) , or you do n't really spell it out ( as with greece ) , because only poles are dumm and only in poland is everything shite ( note : i 'm being sarcastic here ) . 
  also , contrasting colours , so it 's easy to spot the difference . 
  it what ? 
  is good translation , is whole pravda , yes . 
  cheers . 
  you 're right , my bad . 
  they 're in a race , a race for asshats . 
  he also was almost certainly the first person to ever do so , worth noting . 
  i now know the depths waszczykowski reaches are limitless . 
  it 's about the people , not the government , is it ? 
  what are your hourly rates , sigmund ? 
  is that what happened ? 
  would you , however , commemorate those that have fallen and the losses that were experienced ? 
  ca n't speak for all of them . 
  i know there are a lot of really valuable smart people there , and i know that unfortunately there are some who are quite blinded by the glare of russia 's perceived might . 
  this one did n't , but i hear [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2ftvzvezda.ru%2fnews%2fqhistory%2fcontent%2f201707310904-1vri.htm&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) is a thing . 
  shit , i 've seen a lot of inane yt comments , but it 's been a while since i saw that level of crock as under that topol launch video . 
  not a good bargain , any way you look at it , if you ask me . 
  it 's not about whether anyone in the world believes this , it 's about whether anyone in the \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440 ( * russkiy mir * , [ russian world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russkiy_mir_foundation ) / ) believes it . 
  and , unfortunately , i 'm afraid that some do . 
  why not a graph showing [ gdp by ppp ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.pp.cd?locations=ru ) ? 
  as am i. i 'm sorry . 
  are russian people generally okay with distorting reality and falsifying history ? 
   can you provide document ? 
  [ a brief on the airlift ] ( http://www.warsawuprising.com/airlift.htm ) [ roosevelt-churchill-stalin communications ] ( http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/roosevelt_churchill_stalin.htm ), 
  did the fight for radzymin occur only and exclusively because of what was happening in warsaw at the time , with an explicit goal to further intervene in the city ? 
  would soviets otherwise have halted their exhausted advance not on the shore of the river , but rather have left a beachhead for the germans to hold ? 
  trust a guy called `` kommie '' to tell it how it was . 
  it will be genuinely interesting to see . 
  oh , sorry , if i touched a sore spot . 
  it 's `` bitwa narod\u00f3w '' in polish , which is analogous to the battle of nations . 
  love it , thanks !, 
   a federation not yet , is it ? 
  [ ** ayup , sarcasm alert ** ] but are n't those monuments a piece of russia away from russia ? 
  [ ** sarcasm over , boyo ** ], 
  well , let 's drink to that , my brother in plight ( of being russia 's neighbour ) . 
  pepper spray , since it 's effective . 
  then , unfortunately , pay the fine for illegal possession . 
  how about this : a person drives a vehicle without a proper licence , is then hit by a different vehicle . 
  should the driver without a licence be prosecuted for driving a vehicle without a licence or not ? 
  ( the driver of the vehicle causing the crash will be prosecuted for causing the crash ), 
  if it please you , i will . 
  `` vulture '' is the english word , i believe ?
