  yeah , i just wanted to know where you found it . 
  understood , thanks . 
  is this you , or there 's a sauce that goes with this ? 
  [ been there , done that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vistula_land ), 
  i realise that . 
  i wonder where is the line we 'll inexorably draw ( and we will draw it , because the migratory pressures will not lessen , they will increase ) , beyond which the immoral will become the moral , i.e. 
  where refusing to accept more will be the right thing to do . 
  also , please do note , i very consciously use the word `` refugee '' . 
  economic migrants , as understandable as their dreams of a better life may be , will have to increasingly sit this one out , are we to fulfil our current moral duty and accept the real refugees ( who also , however callous it may seem , will have to be screened ) . 
  that may be in accordance with the letter of the law , but is it accordance with the spirit of humanity ? 
  they remain refugees until they find themselves in a situation that bears a semblance to normal life - life you or i could lead , if need be ; i 'm not talking about luxuries , i 'm talking about a life in dignity . 
  one mpe yesterday , following juncker 's speech said it aptly : dublin ( the agreement , not the city ) is dead . 
  it is impossible to expect hungary , greece , italy , spain to house all those people . 
  a redistribution scheme is an inevitability that is preferable to a collapse of the eu , is it not ? 
  to me it is . 
  it 's a terrible solution , but it 's better than many other alternatives . 
  why are n't other alternatives pursued , if better ones do exist ? 
  i suppose some alternatives are being pursued , even if it 's with the same kind of limp conviction the eu , when working on a divisive issue , has been mustering for the past months/years , [ edit : but it 's taking time . ], 
  it 's a shite game to continue to play the way we have been ; something needs to change , but taking it out on the refugees is a shite way to go about it . 
  i totally lost it !, 
  wonderful , thanks . 
  what 's the source for this image ? 
  can some swedish speaker shed some light ? 
  okay , thanks . 
  i do n't remember these threads and i suppose they must have simply slipped under the radar , considering there was little to no discussion in two of them , and i do n't always check the `` new '' tab , or `` controversial '' or however people find those threads . 
  apologies , i take back what i wrote earlier . 
  * doublon * the thread away !, 
  it does n't seem to have been posted previously , though ? 
  perhaps it 's the awareness of finding himself in [ the kind of place the eu is ] ( http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/gutenb/brant/narrens/bilder/0004.jpg ) when taking into account the actual level of agency he has that stands behind and colours his behaviour ? 
  oh , do n't worry , there is a rotation , as they are no strangers to burn out . 
  no , nowhere have i stated that it ( i.e. 
  the idea of employing the best employee available ) seems hard to me . 
  i really do n't know where you 're taking this from . 
  i am sorry , but no , that does not explain it . 
  i 'm not sure if i understood you correctly - but are you currently , or have you previously been , an interpreter ? 
  if not , then i dare say you may not have developed a good enough comprehension of what being in that job entails . 
  rest assured , i can say with total confidence that these interpretations are in 99.999 % of cases ** not ** being carried out badly on purpose and that those interpreters there are striving for performing to the best of their abilities . 
  do you agree with the sentiment of the now deleted comment ? 
  that the politico interpretation was lacking ? 
  i only listened to it for a brief moment and it 's really difficult for me to judge , the interpretation overdubbing the original on both channels and me not knowing french ( was it french juncker was speaking ? 
  ) ; from the brief moment i had listened to it , though , i was not struck with an impression of a glaringly broken message . 
  for the eu official stream translation i was not struck with such an impression either , but i really am in no position to judge between the two interpretations . 
  if politico 's interpretations are , indeed , crap , then , yes , they ought to reconcile their economic capacity with a desire to present the original message as verily as possible . 
  that 's a given , is n't it ? 
  but will you agree with me it is taxing and difficult and mishaps are inevitable ? 
  would you also agree with me that there are various circumstances that can vastly affect an interpreters performance on a given day and it requires tremendous mental stamina to perform consistently on a high level for extended periods of time ? 
  i encourage you to learn a foreign language and conduct a simultaneous live interpretation , flawlessly . 
  then do it for one , two hours non-stop . 
  have fun . 
  you will have noted the disclaimer present on the [ official stream ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20150831ipr91005/html/state-of-the-union-statement-by-president-of-the-commission-09-09-2015 ) . 
  bottom line ? 
  simultaneous live interpretation is a very taxing and difficult thing . 
  what ? 
  i thought it was pretty amusing , 
  moderation is needed , of this there can be no doubt . 
  i am of the opinion , however , that we should be careful about discretionary banning . 
  every such instance should be afforded heightened scrutiny . 
  i am ready to say that , from what i 've seen , there have been cases of unfounded de-listing by the mod in question . 
  two conclusions , at this stage : * the rest of the mod team need to get their collective rear into gear and participate , especially in these contentious examples ; * if shills are such an issue , limit absolutely new accounts ( gestation period up for debate by the mods ) from submitting new links/self-posts and append a `` new user '' flair to post submissions within existing threads ( like , for instance , / r/russia did ) . 
  perhaps introduce a requirement of activity during the gestation period to make shills jump through additional loops for inconvenience , so they ca n't just register batches of new accounts for future use and would have to at least invest the effort to accrue some activity record on the account . 
  maybe it 's a sort of a reverse charade ? 
  get everyone to come to europe , while sneaky-sneaky europeans grab hold of the entire africa and middle earst all in one fell swoop , ta-da , cha-ching !, 
  that is not entirely true , is it , though ? 
  yes , there is a lack of vigorous effort on the repatriation front , and a huge disparity between the professed will for reunification and actual effort . 
  yes , the government can and has to intensify its efforts - and someone with their head screwed on right ought to sort out a comprehensive pipeline from the top down and bottom up : how to inform these people about the legal possibilities ( karta polaka , etc. 
  ) , then some work ought to be done on how karta polaka works in practice , clerks should get a move on in processing applications , yes . 
  `` does n't care '' is a bit of an unnecessary exaggeration , though , i think . 
  something is better than nothing and it ought to be a starting point for further efforts . 
  and polish . 
  i wish someone up and wiped that scum off the face of the earth !, 
  / * s *** s *** s *, 
  i think you are confusing me with someone . 
  i 'm not getting worked up . 
  quite the opposite . 
  i am very , very calm . 
  my first sentence was a joke ( ha-ha ) . 
  the only person that seems to be working themselves up is you . 
  easterners , in my view , do n't usually act as if you should thank them on your knees ; on the whole , they act as human beings who would like to be treated as such by their fellow human beings ( i presume this applies to you ? ) . 
  i implore you to take a minute , calm down , think about your feelings for a moment and understand that you 've gone off on a bit of a tangent , perhaps spurred on by some internal frustrations of yours , the way it looks to me . 
  do i want a good life ? 
  yes . 
  does being in the eu ( whilst staying in my native country , mind ; i do n't believe in the mass migration and do n't want to be part of a problem ) allow me to improve my life faster than it would be happening outside the eu ? 
  yes . 
  am i taking things away from you ? 
  i do n't know , you tell me . 
  tell me how much you 've lost because of me ( figuratively ) being in the eu . 
  then think about whether there is any benefit of countries other than yours being in the eu ? 
  if you ca n't find any , maybe it 's time to clamour for a change of the situation to your politicians . 
  or perhaps it 's a time to try and find out more why we 're together in the same house now ( figuratively ) . 
  peace be with you . 
  i know , hence i wrote  a mixture of a range european nations ** that was subsequently being added to ** i apologise for oversimplifying , as , yes , initially there was more than the purely european elements . 
  i also wrote that comment in a hurry , early in the morning . 
  we can count on your total and absolute understanding , as usual , of course , no ? 
  bitter sarcasm aside , levelling differences what everyone was signing up for when the eu was extended , sorta kinda , would n't you say ? 
  i 'm not sure it has to entail a `` deterioration for you '' , as you put it . 
  maybe it will , sorry . 
  the world is not fair , humans tend to be shitty to each other , nature does n't care , life goes on . 
  the end . 
  i will have to whole-heartedly agree and say you aptly enunciated a few important points . 
  the questions of how many more refugees are to be expected , how many more europe ( collectively ) will be able to shelter and what is being done about the root causes come to mind .
