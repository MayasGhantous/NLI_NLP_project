  not swedes either . 
  how could our potential enemy be , i wonder , hmmmmmmmmmmmm ?? 
  thing is , he 's a satirist , so i 'm not entirely sure if he meant the praise in earnest . 
  actually , i 'd describe him more as a proto-troll . 
  he trolled jaruzelski and gorbachev ( [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm2fsf5iqa8 ) he sang of `` airing the waxworks room '' , with an upside-down red star on his cap , for instance ) , now he 's trolling trump . 
  no skin off your back , i think ? 
  anyways , as per the health minister 's recommendation , the government wants to increase tax on beer , which is what 's being consumed the most , so chances are the number may drop a bit ( although it wo n't be fine for our fledgling home-grown craft beer industry ) . 
  i see no girls there ? 
  who did it ? 
  fruits ? 
  i 'd guess it 's more to do with the adoption of christianity and later on its orthodoxy , rather than some sort of organised or spontaneous nation-wide soul-seeking . 
  might i venture `` was '' , instead of `` has been '' , in that case ? 
  i mean , since we 're talking about the persian world - how recent can that be ? 
  [ we tried ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/fabryka_samochod\u00f3w_rolniczych_\u201epolmo\u201d_w_poznaniu ) , jerries [ bought us out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fsc_star ) . 
  i have this nagging suspicion that the german car industry does n't want more competition on its eastern flank . 
  ( this is an off-hand comment that i made quickly without properly referencing and considering everything , take it for what it 's worth ), 
  cheers . 
  might i add a few more pieces worthy of consideration ? 
  [ barry lyndon soundtrack ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mponjrm5dly ) ( includes german music , as well , for us continentals ), 
  i would n't particularly mind seeing it , but i do n't think i 'll ever visit the us . 
  speaking for myself - as a kid ( that 's early 90 's ) i viewed the brazilian carnival as something exotic and exciting , but now i do n't particularly endorse it . 
  it 's their thing , but it 's over-sexualised , to my tastes . 
  about the mardi gras i am rather ignorant , having only heard not seen , but here the same rule applies - it 's indecorous to me . 
  i bet that 's what the people of sodom and gomorrah said as well . 
  ( i quip . ), 
  i heartily recommend russian state tv . 
  the viewing is surreal . 
  not true . 
  a ban is only for the first two times . 
  third time results in disposal . 
  teams have already been dispatched to that user 's location . 
  to yours as well , just for safe measure . 
  because those that were deemed acceptably passable for aryan were to be stolen and raised as germans , oblivious to their origins . 
   hitler did n't kill poles just for being poles . 
  uhm , i will have to ask for a source on that , because [ as far as i can tell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racial_policy_of_nazi_germany#policies_regarding_poles.2c_russians_and_other_slavs ) - he totally did ask jerries to do just that . 
  how did you measure this `` majority of the people in the eu '' ? 
  ah-hah - racist assuming unmasked , thou blackest of villains !, 
  naturally , outsiders may perceive airs of superiority in an eu citizen , but rest assured - it is nothing like that . 
  we are just that awesome by nature . 
  it is indubitable that the eu played a crucial role in all of those as well , of course . 
  it goes without saying . 
  it is * the * guardian to read if you know anything about anything . 
  yes , i realise that . 
  i can tell a fellow [ mortician ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fssrxbfcen0 ) afficionado when i see one , yessiruh ... wait , what . 
  not really , though i do find it marginally more tolerable when it 's a sex i am not romantically interested in , as explained previously . 
  it 's a combination of sound , smell and just plain presence of some else . 
  well , i thought we were in a thread about genderless toilets , hence any self-consciousness discussed ( without specifically indicating otherwise ) will be related to our physiological processes ( such as pissing , shitting , farting , etc. 
  ) , which i - perhaps in a display of how old-fashioned i am - find best done in private , where it wo n't violate the norms of social coexistence ( assuming one still acceptable norm of such is not farting in the presence of others ) , or at least in an area where the likelihood of meeting a potential romantic partner is limited ( albeit i will grant you that i am heterosexual , but generally speaking i rarely meet gay men who have it tattooed on their foreheads , so i ca n't immediately tell and i do n't really pay any attention to the other men in the toilet ) . 
  that said , i am not explicite against unisex toilets - i share one with my wife , and there is one like that at one of the places where i work ( due to space constraints ) . 
  i 'd rather not be in one when the opposite sex is using it , and i 'd prefer if they were n't there when i do . 
  i do rather mind when people are not self-conscious enough to fart in a crowded tram . 
  thank you very much , but i appreciate this ( and others ) aspects of self-consciousness . 
  well , why do n't you think of the leprechauns !, 
  the nazis stole and ruined ( i.e. 
  ca n't be used without being perceived through its perverted meaning ) the swastika , the lgbti community stole and ruined the rainbow . 
  where are the bloody leprechauns , fighting back to reclaim their symbol ? 
  where 's their mythical fighting spirit ? 
  also , did you know that basketball is a game about putting a ball ( '' - ball '' ) in a basket ( `` basket - '' ) ? 
  you hold back no truths , do you ? 
  who would have thought . 
  i honestly had no idea - i thought it was an honest mistake . 
  no worries . 
  we will lock them up in concentration camps . 
  they wo n't be leaving . 
  it sounds like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/pl-gda\u0144sk.ogg ) . 
  it 's medieval wood that 's now blackened seriously . 
  the archaeological musem tower ? 
  the views never get old . 
  somewhere out of the posterior combined with the context of all the other quotes , quite frankly . 
  't was a fib , i confess . 
  exploitation of minorities and forced labour . 
  also , implying ownership and governance over sovereign human beings , i presume . 
  no , really . 
  incorrect on the subway claim . 
  they 're either 15 or 30 cm long here . 
  on account of belonging to the eec , yes . 
   refusing to comply to any eu regulation i may have to ask for a source on that - to my eyes - bold claim . 
  would he still putin if they did n't put out ? 
  oh , the absolute madman . 
  no , i do n't think they deserve to be enslaved . 
  i wish they could figure out a way to live in their host society according to its rules , rather than according to their whimsy . 
  gypsy is as gypsy does . 
  it 's ciri . 
  do n't you see the medallion ? 
  how about we check ? 
  a czech checks in at a czech hotel , in prague , czech , handing over his id with the words `` check it out '' , but his czech id does n't check out , so the porter says : `` check-mate , my czech mate . '', 
  username checks out , then , i guess ? 
  that is correct . 
  and from what i read , one of the four tanks participating broke down and they were given the choice of pulling out or continuing with three . 
  they continued with three , apparently . 
  [ here 's more ] ( http://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/05/austria-wons-strong-europe-tank.html ), 
  how much fish do you eat then ? 
  let 's say , what - a 250 g portion weekly ? 
  52 weeks in a year , say . 
  that 's 13 kg alone . 
  you never eat any outside of your weekly meal ? 
  well , go you , if that is the case . 
  oh , do n't you worry . 
  as a visiting pole , i sniffed out your turk plans in a jiffy , as soon as i visited kahlenberg . 
  the salt of the antiperspirant-avoiding turkish youth congregating in the restaurant by the church that so bothers them there was so palpable , that a bulgarian girl vomited all over the bus on the way down .
