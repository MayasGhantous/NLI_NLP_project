  you better believe it . 
  do n't you worry . 
  the poles are coming , better hide yo ' mustafas , better hide yo ' tents !, 
  and were n't you ? 
  do you celebrate him as your national hero , who fought against those bloody muscovite invaders ? 
  genuine question . 
  what are you basing your perception that feliks dzier\u017cy\u0144ski is respected by poles for his actions in his capacity as the founder of cheka ? 
  it would be a quaint sort of pole who 'd do that , from where i 'm sitting . 
  i find it prudent not to underestimate the magnitude of general ignorance . 
  like i said , a half-truth is a form of a lie , and the version i profferred does signal a more complex situation . 
  your enunciation unnecessarily explicates elements which the inquisitive mind may look up for themselves , since the reference is there . 
  the original title does not reference a wide allied coalition against nazi germany . 
  the title reads : `` happy victory day !, 
  on this day , 72 years ago , soviet union was victorious over nazi germany . 
  let us remember the brave men and women who fought , and in many cases , died for this victory . '', 
  without context , it sounds like it was a fight between two belligerents , which it was n't . 
  a half-truth is still a form of a lie . 
  let me proffer a different version of the title . 
  `` happy victory day !, 
  on this day , 72 years ago , the soviet union celebrated allied victory over nazi germany , to which it contributed the most . 
  let us remember the brave men and women who fought , and in many cases , died for this victory . '', 
  tell me what faults you find in my version , and maybe we can clarify and - with any luck - even reach understanding . 
  ( as for your question regarding the americans - do americans frequently take all the credit for winning wwii on those days of celebration ? 
  then call them out on it . ), 
  yes , i can . 
  nevertheless , the surrender was unconditional , to all allied forces at the same time . 
  that due to the nature of timezones and due to stalin 's refusal to accept the initial act of signing from the 7th of may , the celebration falls on the 9th moscow time is what was later escalated into a separate celebration , when the cause for celebration had originally been the same . 
  just because the soviets wanted to manipulate the memory and celebrate alone , trying to convince their people that wwii was their fight and their fight alone , does n't mean we have to continue the soviet tradition . 
  we can celebrate on different dates to honour the anniversary of the initial celebration , but to attribute all the credit to the soviets is disingenuous . 
  when they surrendered to whom is a technicality . 
  they fought the same war together , the second world war . 
  they were allies together . 
  and germans did n't surrender separately to the us or the soviets . 
  [ the surrender was unconditional . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_instrument_of_surrender ), 
  now read again what i wrote . 
  and look again at what you just wrote . 
  you are missing one crucial piece . 
  i `` work 80 % of the task = russians killing 80 % of german soldiers . '', 
  you `` work 20 % of the task = allies killing 20 % of german soldiers '' and then i take 100 % of the credit . 
  ( like the title of the op ), 
  [ he sure can walk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giwkb-x7wxq ), 
   when poland is pissed off by france , it 's because france is right . 
  which situation are you referencing specifically , for clarity ? 
  from what i gather , the treated was signed in the early hours of 7th may ( around 2 am cet ) , it was just that the unconditional surrender became effective towards 11 pm on the 8th ( hence 9th of may moscow time ) . 
  specifically , jodl - authorised by doenitz and the okw signed it in eisenhower 's hq in reims , in the presence of [ general susloparov ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0421\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432,_\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d_\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 ) , who signed it on behalf of soviet leadership , which was supposed to have made stalin furious - since he had not authorised anything and since he had wanted to have the germans capitulate to the soviets . 
  this , on stalin 's insistence , led to a repeated signing of the capitulation in berlin , in front of the soviets , on the 9th of may . 
  [ i base this on beevor , berlin : the downfall 1945 ], 
  well , germany surrendered unconditionally on the 8th , the 9th was a repetition of the surrender act to accommodate the soviets . 
  unless you mean to say that on the 9th the soviet union defeated an enemy who had already surrendered ? 
  that 'd be a bit like knocking down an open door then . 
  if you want to use that analogy , you 'd be my co-worker , i 'd do 80 % of the work , you 'd do 20 % and i 'd take all the credit . 
  i believe the end of the war in europe is , at least in some way , connected with its beginning , which - openly - was on 1 september 1939 , albeit there had been a build-up to that moment ( the failed appeasement , carving up of czechoslovakia , the ribbentrop-molotov pact ) . 
  would you not agree ? 
  how about you answer a question i actually ask you ? 
  did the western allies conduct any military action prior to 1944 ? 
  did their industrial capacity in any way influence the war against germany ? 
  did they have any sort of intelligence that they may have acted upon themselves and that they may have shared with the soviet union ? 
  and if the guerillas - or partisans , or resistance fighters , however you call them - also participated in the war against germany , why does n't this post mention them as well ? 
  so the western allies only entered the war in 1944 and had never contributed anything prior to that ? 
  generally speaking i think there 's a growing awareness of just how big a role the red army played in defeating germany ; the problem is , however , with the convenient oversights - the ribbentrop-molotov pact and the way germany and the soviets established their spheres of influence and also downplaying the role western allies may have played ( for instance by manipulating the language of the title of this post to avoid mentioning any other country ; oh , yes , russians celebrate it on a different day on account of a different calendar , but there was a single , joint victory in the west , was there not ? 
  some will say it was the stretched supply lines . 
  thousands of kilometres long they were !, 
  it was impossible to cross the vistula and `` li ( e ) berate '' the western side of warsaw - the river is anywhere from 400 m to 1.4 km wide in the city , it 's impossible !, 
  lies !, 
  nothing is impossible for the glorious red army !, 
  what uprising ? 
  they were just bandits and bank robbers - what are you going to do ? 
  [ exeunt ; curtain ], 
  well . 
  in perfect world we would all have fewer inconveniences , indeed . 
  maybe in a thousand years , if humanity survives that long . 
  probably never . 
  definitely not soon enough . 
  uh-huh . 
  so if i understand you correctly - you are of the opinion that there should be no such thing as state borders ( since `` who gives a shit '' ) ? 
  they 're getting quite cunning , these black western nazi jewophile gay degenerates , you see ? 
  but there 's no tricking old vladdy-p , there 's naught he shall not see !, 
  does have a ring of the poetic about it , does n't it ? 
  [ you all did see that on the lupercal / i thrice presented him a kingly crown , / which he did thrice refuse : was this ambition ? / yet brutus says he was ambitious ; / and , sure , he is an honourable man . 
  ] ( http://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/friends-romans-countrymen/ ), 
  what you relegate to a footnote you are prone to forget . 
  and some time after that - why even have a footnote , if it 's such a minor detail that the mainstream audience does n't care about ? 
  and so the memory warps . 
  did the soviet union defeat nazi germany all alone then ? 
  without the uk and the commonwealth , the us , resistance movements in occupied countries , without any of that ? 
  til . 
  so , let me get this straight , generally speaking you are in favour of redrawing state borders based on the ethnic criterion ? 
  the group-think is strong . 
  emotions and a perceived attack on the accepted status quo elicits a retaliatory response . 
  i think it 's still too much to ask at this - early - point in our evolution to avoid such foibles . 
  so it 's not entirely limited to this sub alone - and it is a rather large one ; the larger they get the less meaningful the discussion will become , i find . 
  the 7 are there just for luck . 
  so it is 666 . 
  well , in a choice between ** ( !!, 
  ! trigger warning , grossly exaggerated and perhaps not entirely apt characterisations follow !!!,

  and emmanuel `` poland 's putin 's putain and i 'll have sanctions against it !, 
  '' , i ca n't say either eventuality gave me much mirth .
