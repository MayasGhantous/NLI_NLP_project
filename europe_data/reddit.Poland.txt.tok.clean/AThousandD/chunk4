  thank you for your voice . 
  sweet , i was hoping we 'd all live to see that . 
  next tier queen when ? 
  i 've seen the vids , and they were broadcast by tvn24 , a private polish news-channel . 
  i do n't know if they syndicated rtl footage , or what . 
  as st. steve jobs ( it was him , was it not ? ), 
  once said : it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it . 
  i suppose that 's one way of looking at it , that may perhaps encompass at least a grain of truth . 
  the other guy said something along the lines : `` if the us could do it , you can do it . 
  also , switzerland and [ i forget , singapore ? ], 
  are very multicultural , so it 's okay '' . 
  i am somewhat aware of how the immigration issue had been handled in the us historically ( for instance the anti-catholic aspect you mentioned ) , but it 's important - i think - to remember your nation was founded from thin air ( if you do n't mind me saying that ; anecdotally , i 'll always have the image of a drunkenly rambling painter travelling in a train with me once when i was a teenager , rambling about the , pardon the expression , `` mongrel nation '' that cracked me up at that time ) . 
  the american ethnicity ( can we call it that ? ), 
  was from the grounds up a mixture of a range european nations that was subsequently being added to . 
  post-wwii , due to a combination of several factors ( i.e. 
  : loss of the jewish diaspora through the war and emmigration post-war , loss of eastern polish-held territories in favour of the ussr , acquisition of silesia , pomerania and parts of eastern prussia and the subsequent deportation of the germans settled there ) poland became ( largely ) ethnically monolithic ( like several other neighbouring countries ) ; some people considered it one of the few benefits of the country having gone through war - considering the various ethnic tensions pre-war ( on the axes of polish-ukrainian , polish-byelarussian , polish-lithuanian , polish-czechoslovakian and polish-jewish relations ) , which became largely absent ( until , perhaps among other moments post-war , the 1968 anti-jewish party-inspired sentiment which lead to the emigration of most of the remaining jewish diaspora , i believe ) . 
  now that homogeneity is being put into question ; like i previously indicated , i believe there are good ways of going about de-homogenising this country , if such is the historic inevitability , and i am led to believe poland , [ historically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_poland ) , has had a pretty good record of co-existing ( mostly ) peacefully with ( at least some ) other ethnicities in the confines of one state . 
  it 's just that i believe rushing the issue right now may be counter-effective . 
  one crucial distinction between the us situation throughout the 19th century ( this the time you are referring to , i presume ? ), 
  and the eu in the 21st century is that , i hope we 'll agree , the us was in a period of nation-building , expanding its territory and founding new cities . 
  again , i do n't feel fully qualified to assess this in detail , but the position of the us then and the eu now were at least somewhat different , were they not ? 
  pm kopacz said what she said , i believe , because she 's in a train car with no brakes bound for an election defeat next month , with her party desperately hoping for a miracle that 's , most probably , not coming . 
  the numbers floated here earlier today from a spanish newspaper that i ca n't find at the moment were something along 9000 , putting us fourth in europe , behind germany , france , spain , for the number of refugees to be taken in . 
  personally , i believe it 's doable and it should n't cause a collapse of our economy , albeit i have to point out that with our gdp being approximately half of germany 's , and what i 'd call [ a shortage of serious , indigenous companies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_companies_of_poland ) - several of which are subsidiaries of foreign companies ( compared , not to look far for an example , to [ germany 's list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_companies_of_germany ) , the economic implications of immigration merit a separate , detailed scrutiny . 
  i would like to hope it should also be manageable from a demographic and cultural point of view . 
  one thing that i suppose could be done is to distribute these people so they assimilate locally , instead of keeping them in refugee camp enclaves ( but maybe it 's my misguided and uninformed view ) , but current news reports seem to be hinting at the refugee camp strategy . 
  also , i know someone who works in an ngo , helping immigrants integrate ( mostly ukrainians , but also some chechens , and a collection of people from all over south america , philippines and an odd american or two ; many of these people are being repatriated on the basis of [ karta polaka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karta_polaka ) , many are economic immigrants , or have come here to join their husbands/wives , some are actual refugees ) - interfacing with government offices , helping with doctor 's visits , helping children integrate into the education system , etc. 
  i see them doing quite a lot of good , but i also see they 're limited by the funding they have to and can get ( for instance from norwegian funds , i forget the fund name , or via eu funds ) , as well as legal considerations ( i do n't know too many details , but it 's been made clear to me that the current legal situation has several shortcomings at least ) . 
  hence my apprehension at poland being forced into acting now : the situation is far from ideal , and things 'll be adjusting along the way . 
  lastly , i 've just come back from a trip to vienna and i have to say it 's a wonderful city ( even if , not having been to the uk or anywhere strongly multi-cultural for a few years , i felt a little surprised at how many different ethnicities lived there ; you can call me racist , if you have to , but i was simply surprised , coming from poland ) and a wonderful country . 
  one of the best trips of my life , for sure and i 'd love to visit again . 
  congratulations on living in such a nice place !, 
  this is really an unenviable position we 've all found ourselves in . 
  it 's such a complex situation , with so many facets ( stop them/let them in ? 
  process and vet them/let them all in ? 
  force other countries to partake in the help effort/abstain from forcing people into countries where they do n't want to be at the risk of straining one 's economy ? 
  and i 'm sure a thousand more ) and complications ( people die in transit/suffer while waiting to be processed/destroy their id and masquerade as someone they are not/etc . ), 
  that even if i were an expert on the issue ( and by no means i am not ) , i 'd hate for the life of me to have to deal with this and be responsible for what follows . 
  to my mind , it 's almost as if , as someone once put it , [ the only winning move is not to play ] ( https://youtu.be/nhwjlcairqo?t=3m34s ) . 
  that , however , is not an option . 
  still , the whole refugee issue - and the migration that is piggy-backing along - it 's so complex , that i fear no one - not even the experts - are able to grasp the whole complexity of the situation and formulate a holistic , well-developed response ( due to multiple factors , e.g. 
  : time constraints and the need for urgent action , fiscal constraints , demographic constraints , public opinion constraints , etc. ) . 
  therefore , we make do with these ersatz solutions , born out of the need of the moment : germany asks hungary to let them pass , then starts giving signs that it 's ready to do * realpolitik * and , as the * de facto * leading player of the eu , force the hands of those who have lesser bargaining positions . 
  i would stay my hand for now , lest i cast a stone in anger - which i really do n't feel - against my ( german ) brother . 
  on a fundamental , human level - i can understand why germany welcomed the refugees . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm qualified to mete out judgement , but i can imagine worse decisions could have been taken . 
  at the same time , apart from the fundamental , human level , there is also the economic level and this is where politicians come in , because , it seems , they are the ones making shitty decisions , so things do n't get shittier . 
  or perhaps they will , but then it 'll most likely be other politicians who 'll be having to deal with that mess . 
  but who can tell that before-hand - we 're all fallible humans , limited by our flawed perceptions and marred by imperfections of our characters and none of us can tell the future with certainty . 
  and then there 's the local ( here : polish ) perspective . 
  you can hold it against me , and i hope i do n't risk a ban ( i 'd be sad to go ) , when i write that our economic backwardness , what we call here ( pardon the expression , but polish , and poles , has a tendency to be much more direct and , for lack of a better term , visceral than english ) `` 20 years behind the blacks '' ( dwadzie\u015bcia lat za murzynami ) , an expression which epitomises the handicap dealt to our country/economy by the 20th century ( and which , i would argue , is not meant to be offensive to africans ) , meant we have never yet had to go through the perhaps sometimes misguided and short-sighted policies of multi-culturalism ( mind : i 'm not saying no to immigrants or refugees ; i 'm saying i believe there are good ways of assimilating foreigners into a country and there are bad ways of failing to assimilate foreigners that may , further down the road , lead to multifarious negative consequences , for various parties involved ) . 
  thus our economic backwardness was our chance to observe the solutions that worked in terms of integration policies and a chance to avoid the mistakes of those policies that have failed , or back-fired . 
  but now , our hands are being forced by the constraints of time and we 're being pressured into a policy that , the apprehension exists , has not been thoroughly thought through . 
  really , i fear this is a game no one can `` win '' , but we , europeans , are going through the motions anyway . 
  again , you can hold it against me , but from where i 'm sitting , the future is a very uncertain thing and that 's not making me happy . 
  lastly , apologies for this being rambling-ish ( i usually try to be comprehensive , but clear about what i write ) , but i like to understand things and the current refugee/migrant situation is something i can hardly make heads or tails of and it 's obviously very upsetting . 
  bravo , that 's ( at least ) two levels deeper , right off the bat . 
  i was intending to get there in stages , but we 've just cut it short a tad . 
  i suppose , someone could say - why stop there ? 
  but , as far as i am concerned , that 'll suffice . 
  blame is , well , it 's not blame , really . 
  a statement of facts , to my mind . 
  risking oversimplification and mockery from / r/badhistory once again today , the german-started wwii , the kick-starting of which was aided ( greatly ? ), 
  by the ribbentrop-molotov pact , lead to a chain of events that ended up with the iron curtain and the cold war and the current gdp of the countries that were out of the wonderful post-war marshal 's plan and this lead to us being here today , together under one roof and , well , that 's that . 
  again , this is not an accusation , but a statement of facts ( that may well be subject to clarification , please be my guest ) , i would hope . 
  personally , no hard feelings towards germany and let bygones be bygones . 
  i am not sure how to put this , but here goes . 
  you need to go deeper . 
  why was communism in there in the first place ? 
  yeah , it 's mentioned in the ( polish ) wiki article i 've linked to . 
  polish also has the phrase [ `` cap '' ] ( https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/cap#cap_.28j.c4.99zyk_polski.29 ) , defined as `` ram ; stupid person '' , among others . 
  the verb `` capi\u0107 '' means `` to stink '' ( presumably as a ram would ) . 
  it 's just that the apparent , if tenuous , link made me always wonder , but i suppose i 'm now guilty of a thought crime , having seemingly offended * someone 's * sensibilities . 
  magnificent , astounding , awe-inspiring , wondrous , exhilaratingly beautiful , etc. 
  ( words hardly suffice ), 
  fine , this 'll go to / r/badhistory , but i 've always wondered about the ethymology of the word `` kacap '' . 
  so , / r/badhistory , please advise . 
  apparently , [ '' \u043a\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043f '' ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kacap_ ( okre\u015blenie ) * ) does exist in ukrainian , but i ca n't help but notice that when rendered in the latin alphabet - `` kacap '' , ( to me at least ) it 'll look surprisingly similar to the cyrillic '' \u041a\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440 '' ( kasar , latinised ) , which i 'm wont to find remotely similar to what [ '' \u0425\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440 '' ( khazar ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khazars ) could sound like , when the initial sound is mispronounced . 
  alright , rip away , historians , linguists , so that i may learn . 
  i summon thee , / r/badhistory !, 
  edit : the first link wo n't work , because - apparently - reddit formating removes additional closing parentheses . 
  just add a closing parenthesis to the end of the hyperlink . 
  nope , sorry , would never use `` ruscy '' / `` ruski '' for ukrainians , nor byelarussians . 
  back to the drawing board with your theory , i 'm sorry to say . 
  what was the idea behind the eu transfer payments ? 
  off the top of my head - to level off the economic disparities between the various countries , i thought . 
  this element of the economic policy puzzle is one thing that is not working towards that goal , i feel . 
  economically a very sound move for germany , i think . 
  direct access to russian gas , now there 's even less reason for germany to care about ukraine and that 's good for germany , because it was a quagmire anyway , that whole ( russia ) - donetsk-luhansk-ukraine business . 
  additionally , germany can now politically pressure the unruly central european country that is too reluctant to accept a wave of mixed migration containing both culturally foreign economic immigrants and war refugees with the aid of moscow 's natural gas . 
  ( albeit in this context the [ disastrous decision ] ( http://www2.polskieradio.pl/eo/dokument.aspx?iid=142521 ) by former minister of economy waldemar pawlak to sign a gas deal betrothing us to russian gas at prices [ higher than most other places in europe , and certainly among the highest prices in the eu ] ( http://media.ampp3d.co.uk/u/2014/04/gasprices.png ) - second only to ukraine and some other , small , balkan client i forgot - until 2022 at least seems a little less disastrous , if it 's any consolation ) all in all , that 's a very nice piece of * realpolitik , frau kanzlerin * . 
  the day has come . 
  i can now legitimately write ** butthurt rushyns ** in case someone missed it ** butthurt butthurt rushyns ** that 's right . 
  when russian national tv news programmes show blatant lies and manipulations designed to foster a hostile view of `` the west '' ( yes , that 's in their ** news programmes ** ) , it should be perfectly okay ( because cnn lied about wmds , truth died , yadda yadda ) . 
  but when norway makes a fictional tv show , then the ** butthurt ** is off the scales . 
  i chortled . 
  that 's actually a curious question . 
  there 's definitely an influx of ukrainians - thing is many of them are not from eastern ukraine and thus they are not afforded refugee status . 
  i 'd actually like to know the hard numbers , as i know someone who works with immigrants helping them integrate here and there 's a definite increase in the number of ukrainians over the previous years , but that 's only what we can observe locally - someone ought to look at the overall numbers for poland . 
  ( one symptom of the ukrainian immigration , for me , is the fact that tvp1 , the first channel of national tv , will show a tv series titled [ `` girls from lviv '' ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/1,90535,18603925,dziewczyny-ze-lwowa-nowy-serial-obyczajowy-6-wrzesnia-w.html ) starting this september ; even though the authors of that series claim it 's not their answer to whether we should or should n't accept immigrants , it is bound to shape people 's perception of the issue , i think ),
