  one important thing , i feel , that would ** not ** make norway into an afghanistan on steroids is the land area , and also the shape of the country . 
  afghanistan is [ 652,864 km ^ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afghanistan ) , whereas norway is , roughly , just over half of that , at [ 385,178 km ^ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway ) . 
  add to that the shape of the country and i feel there 's slightly less room for manoeuvre . 
  albeit all of this assumes a ( nigh ? ), 
  completely passive rest of europe and the world . 
  and whether that would happen is a thing for an altogether completely different discussion . 
  as for civilian resources that may support an asymmetric war - to what are you alluding ? 
  no worries , he 's simply not killed the beria inside of himself yet . 
  i think he still has a long way to go . 
  do you think there is [ anything ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov\u2013ribbentrop_pact ) to [ apologise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_poland#phase_2:_after_soviet_union_invasion_from_the_east ) for ? 
  happy trollin ' !, 
  [ come again ? 
  ] ( http://www2.polskieradio.pl/eo/print.aspx?iid=115168 ) i think this example of polish denial is far greater than anything russia has ever come up with , i 'm sure you 'll agree . 
  part of me laughs as i hope the course would be something like what russia always does in sticky situations : procrastination . 
  just keep quiet and every time russia asks say you need to finish an official inquiry before making a final decision . 
  rinse and repeat for the next few decades . 
  that would be on a level the russian government can understand and appreciate . 
  jokes aside , why are we getting excited about a nobody from russia saying some idiotic things ? 
  give it a rest , that 's a waste of everybody 's collective breath . 
  edit : a nobody from russia quoted by sputnik news , no less . 
  seriously , people , sputnik is mental cancer and any attention devoted to anything they ever say is a loss for humanity . 
  lidl sells it during their `` american week '' thing , i 'm pretty positive . 
  i did n't like it - that salty taste ruined it for me . 
  i was expecting something sweeter . 
  there 's no fooling me . 
  he just wants the benefits , which are called `` jail time '' here . 
  this is no country for honest men !, 
  it 's like in this old old joke about stalin/lenin ( pick one ) : the soviet tv are making a film about stalin 's benevolence . 
  a child comes up to stalin and says `` uncle , uncle , can you give me some candy ? '', 
  stalin blows his lid and shouts obscenities . 
  cue a board about `` technical difficulties '' . 
  consternation . 
  after a few moments a presenter comes on screen and says : `` see , this is how benevolent stalin really is - he could have killed that child ! '', 
  both [ \u017curek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sour_rye_soup ) and [ pierogi ruskie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi#poland ) , tied . 
  i 'll usually have both , when in a restaurant . 
  who ? 
   only a moron would deny history which happened decades ago . 
  introducing [ / u/ivanmedved ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gknmq/78_years_ago_today_polish_operation_of_the_nkvd/ctz9tbn ) , i suppose ? 
  katy\u0144 , communist period , yes , sure , all the time . 
  this ? 
  genocide of poles in the ussr pre-wwii ? 
  really , it may be just me . 
  absolutely - it may just be a case of monumental ignorance on my part , definitely not going to try and say no . 
  like i wrote - it 's the first time ever , i 've heard about it . 
  and i considered myself someone interested in history ( as a dilettante , mind ) . 
  so no , it 's not something that 's been spoken about at length in poland - therefore i 'm not sure if the perception of it being pressed non-stop is justified . 
  maybe because poles tend to be vocal about history ( due to , perhaps , having a feeling that `` the world needs to know about it '' ) is why you may get the feeling . 
  maybe the mods need to make a filter for the polish stuff , so you do n't have to feel it 's being shoved in your face . 
  as for relevance ? 
  is it relevant to know the mistakes of the past to avoid repeating them in the future ? 
  do we need all those different posts saying `` on this day ... years ago ... happened '' ? 
  is memory of history important ? 
  you tell me . 
  seriously !, 
  first time ever i hear about this - and we 're dwelling on katy\u0144 so much ( not that there 's no reason to , but ! ) . 
  ca n't wrap my head around this !, 
  incoming denial-bots , i guess . 
  google translate , so sub-par quality , but you should be able to get the idea . 
  tl ; dr supporters from the city of brzeg went to support \u015al\u0105sk wroc\u0142aw and displayed the coat of arms of their city and later \u015al\u0105sk wroc\u0142aw was penalised with a 15k euro fine , with the reason quoted as there having been a banned symbol on display at the stands . 
  the representatives of the football club were later able to piece together that it may have been the coat of arms of brzeg , since the uefa delegate inquired about it and stared at it for a while . 
  notes : title - `` slask wroclaw uefa punished for arms shore '' should be `` uefa punishes \u015al\u0105sk wroc\u0142aw for the coat of arms of brzeg '' later on , in the text , `` bank '' = `` brzeg '' ( the city ) , and `` herb '' = `` coat of arms '', 
  look - and this goes to / u/leopold _ s too - historians can all argue how it 's easy to condemn britain and france for not acting , but it does n't take a military genius to see how it would have been favourable to strike at germany 's weak back when their forces were tied up in poland - and that 's what the common person is going to know and remember . 
  then it 's easy for jokers like you to come here and blame poland for not having the miraculous ability of predicting that britain and france would leave us hanging out to dry . 
  in case you did n't realise it - allying with britain and france was part of `` taking responsibility for the defense of your own country '' . 
  that 's why i wrote that britain should n't have made the promises it did , because then all sorts of things could have differently - not putting up a hard stance against hitler 's demands in view of the promised support could have very likely been one of those things . 
  either way , the point 's moot . 
  in the pursuit of their own short-sighted goals humans in particular , and nations in general , fuck up all the time . 
  i 'm moving on . 
  what about drole de guerre ? 
  in the end it 's about the false promises , though . 
  if you ca n't follow through on your promises , do n't make them , britain . 
  what 's done is done , let 's move on , but keep in mind these valuable lessons of the past . 
  i suppose it 's not nato itself that has a problem , but - as opinion polls have shown - the citizens of the respective countries involved that would have a problem , so that may be throttling down the political will to go through with any reinforcement plan . 
  what for ? 
  were they the investigators ? 
  yes , i think it pretty clear from this , and the previous videos we 've seen last year that they were desperately trying to find something confirming these were african-american jewish shpions and i ca n't for the love of me imagine how deep their hearts must have sank when they fully realised what they 'd done ( it 's fairly safe to assume they must have some form of hearts , that much is clear ) . 
  ( also , why the insult ? ), 
  alright , i always keep forgetting i had wanted to read gorky , cheers !, 
  ( i guess i need to listen to that scorpions on repeat until i finally get a book or two - what would you recommend ? ), 
  i know these are n't the russians we were looking for , it 's cool . 
  i just wrote that thinking about russians and my previous interactions with them , on historical questions , has left a lasting impression - now , before anyone is triggered and shouts '' \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0444\u043e\u0431\u0438\u044f !!!, 
  '' , as the script would perhaps require , let me say i know there are decent russian people and i am by no means prejudiced against russians . 
  i 'm just sad i do n't get to meet those reasonable ones more often . 
  as i wrote elsewhere in this thread , yes , he should have kept his cool and delivered his request for an interpreter and that would have been that . 
  but then we would n't be here discussing it , most likely , eh ? 
  yes , politeness should have been the course . 
  it was n't , for some reason . 
  however , again referencing what i 've written elsewhere on here , it is my understanding the eu is meant as an egalitarian project . 
  this implies that even `` a citizen of a country with barely 500k people '' does deserve respect . 
  this implies the maltese pm was , in practice , not getting the respect afforded to him by the letter of eu law . 
  or we could go back , i guess , to the alternative . 
  where there is a big boys club , you know , germany and france ( and maybe the uk , but the uk is a bit special , you see ) and the cool cats who would like to hang out with the big boys ( i do n't know , italy ? ), 
  and then the former french president would finally feel fully at ease saying that '' ( insert country here , for example , i do n't know , poland ) had lost its chance to be quiet '' . 
  hell , we could even go back to full putin : `` oi , droog , dis be mine lands , gief nau !, 
  and you - you shut your gob or i bash your face in ! '', 
  question is : is it not justified ? 
  if the eu is meant to be an egalitarian institution where all countries stand side by side , and there are no firsts among the equals ( even though there are countries with more clout than , say , malta ) , then why should the smaller states with fewer friends and less influence always compromise at the behest of the more influential ones ? 
  now , i 'm sure if we were to peer closely enough , we 'd find examples of compromises that go the other way ; a case in point would be this precise situation - i guess he was expecting the rest of the eu to compromise and provide a maltese interpreter . 
  too much ? 
  this is no drama .
