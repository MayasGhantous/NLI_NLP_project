  ( though , generally , i do agree with your sentiment ), 
  well , if the us can hop around the world , picking up vassal states , if the eu grew from its initial shape , why would n't russia be nabbing land as well ? 
  well , as the daily examples of ukrainians i see on the tram here show , some of you are coping with the drive to europe in their ways . 
  now that 's what i call an ultramimetic performance !,

  finally , some ploglessive legislative movement i can get fully behind and elect on !, 
  whoever designed this is lucky beheadings are not a recognised punishment in modern european penal systems anymore !, 
  such ugly design is normally a hanging offence !, 
  wow , a company butt-hurt about a different company using foreign sounding words in their name , despite not being foreign , to the point of taking it to court .

  ... is a german invention . 
  went for the mixture of avoidance and ignoring , with a hint of ostracism and social exclusion , i see , gotcha . 
  ca n't say it 's what i 'd do , but the course you suggest was of your own volition , was n't it . 
  what do you propose to do with them then ? 
  gas chambers ? 
  ostracism , derision and social exclusion to the point of driving them to suicide - hopefully ? 
  just plain old concentration camps ? 
  maybe something more humanitarian ? 
  denying them progeny and outliving them ? 
  ( takes time , and the world does move ever so fast ) taking the tried and tested approach to problems and pretending they do n't exist , until it becomes undeniable that they do ? 
  does it really ? 
  does it go both ways , actually ? 
  i know i 've seen german citizens say hateful things about being german . 
  i know they 've spat on the idea of being german - unironically . 
  the language used in the video by the lyrical i distances itself from and derides traditionalist germans through a variety of emotionally loaded phrases , denies them their nationality relegating them to the position of historical relics ( `` you are not the people , you are the past '' ) , and self-identifies with the progressive group ( `` we are xenophobic 's biggest fear '' , `` being like us takes bigger balls '' , `` we are ... deutsch - [ label ] '' ) . 
  the traditionalist , the ones who use the slogal `` wir sind das volk '' , are shown as zombie-like creatures , lethargic and stiff in their movements , their characters depicted in faded colours of old sepia photographs - as already stated , mere relics of the past . 
  the `` we '' of the lyrical i are colourful , energetic , young , old , gay , trans , muslim , everything . 
  they are life to the traditionalists ' death . 
  does the video go both ways , really ? 
  maybe it does , maybe i err . 
  if i am benighted and blind , please accept my invitation and do enlighten me and open my eyes . 
  `` on the roll '' , the phrase is . 
  for someone boasting of tolerance and compassion , it 's a strange turn of words to call the addressees of this communique `` fuckheads '' and `` shit for brains '' . 
  that does n't strike me as a particularly good way of convincing someone of the error of their ways , assuming it is an error to `` be proud '' , among other things used as accusations aimed at the germans this was addressed to . 
  as already noted elsewhere in the thread , this is extremely divisive and it saddens me to see a trend i 've been observing in poland manifest itself so brashly in this german clip as well : the - from my point of view - absurd drive towards disunity among the nation ( here - the ethnic majority of indigenous germans ) , taking plurality past the breaking point of what had been tying the social fabric together and into the madness of sectarianism . 
  this saddens me as yet another symptom of something truly ugly taking place within european nations .

  [ and you 're lynching negroes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) . 
  have you read the whole article or just skimmed it over ? 
  if the latter , then you might want to look at the last paragraph again , if that 's all you have time for . 
  quite clearly - `` iheartbikes '' , further corroborated by examples of `` i \u2661 bikes '' . 
  you know what they say - by dick or by trick . 
  you misunderstood . 
  when saying it was odd , i was referring to my perception of how two contradictory messages concerning child-bearing ( or having the ability to abort it ) appear together in public . 
  on an individual level - none ; on a societal level - that may be a whole different balls game . 
  i do . 
  why do you ask ? 
  well , quite frankly there are two ways to go about it . 
  either convince all races not to reproduce as fast as they are ( i 'd rather there be less people on earth , than more ) , or accept the fact that it 's a numbers game and the white people need be un-indoctrinated from not reproducing . 
  ( because what white reproduction rates are is the end product of many small pieces of a puzzle ; each thing on its own makes perfect sense in a modern society , but together - the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts . 
  take contraceptives - perfectly sensible on its own . 
  add abortions - why , jarring only to the ultra-conservative loonies , right ? 
  spice up with normalisation of same-gender relationships and affording them legal status , so no one even thinks of setting up a fake man-woman marriage to avoid public stigma . 
  normalise trans-sexuals . 
  blur and strive to eradicate gender roles . 
  shake up well and put some conchita wurst cherry-on-top . 
  voila , negative birth rates cocktail complete . ), 
  problem is , how do we convince everyone else apart from whites not to reproduce as fast as they are ? 
  one thing that dumbfounded me on my visit to vienna in early september last year was the amount of adverts for abortion clinics : in the streets , in the metro . 
  the most confusing moment was when i saw one of those in the metro , right next to some christian pro-life message . 
  one of my friends , when i told her about it , said that that 's the way it should be , so everyone can choose . 
  i 'm not quite so sure myself , there 's something odd about it that i ca n't put my finger on . 
  should the eu be working to open euthanasia centres in the me for those who want to die for islam , instead of seeking to open refugee camps ? 
  call it `` highway to heaven '' centres , or something ? 
  there are people who want to die ? 
  i feel like we could synergise in a great way to proactively benefit everyone if we found people who want to kill those who want to die . 
  some countries already allow this legally if both parties are willing participants , i guess ( holland and belgium , for instance ) , there 's definitely room for manoeuvre here . 
  ah , it 's all good then . 
  carry on . 
  forsooth . 
  what i want to know is who the guy behind mrs merkel is . 
  it 's boris johnson speaking in favour of the uk leaving the eu , that kind of voice . 
  wake me up when september ends , then .
