  i too have seen the conundrum faced by [ the demolition man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7nfenftvcm ) . 
  there ai n't no nothin ' better ` an a good ole circle-jerk , no siree . 
  from [ a metro.co.uk article on this ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/18/tesco-is-banning-curved-croissants-and-replacing-them-with-straight-ones-5704313/ ) : `` did you know ( that ) it was created to celebrate the defeat of the turkish army in the siege of vienna in 1683 ? '', 
  [ 75 % cited customers prefer a straight one ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/tesco-bows-to-customer-demand-in-selling-straight-croissants ) , however . 
  well , in the free market reality customer ** is ** king , or should i say - sultan , afterall . 
  this reminds me of that time when i was coming back from kiev on a train and it turned out that the whole train car was literally stuffed with contraband cigarettes : they had several black trash bags full of cigarettes in the toilet , they had several more hidden in the walls , they had several more in the roof above the compartments ( i realised only afterwards - during the trip i could hear some noises above my head and felt like in a bloody aliens movie ) , they even had a few in the cushions in the compartment i was in . 
  so the polish customs officers found that stuff , pinpointed the likely smugglers and ask one of them to take the blame , so they could let the others go . 
  there was this especially insistent officer , maybe he was new on the job , or he was pissed off , or had n't been paid enough , but he looked like he cared - unlike his colleagues . 
  so the ukrainians start crying , none of them want to take the blame . 
  impasse and a back and forth of threats and pleas for half an hour or so . 
  eventually this one officer realises all the other officers do n't give a shit and he gives up as well . 
  despite the threats that all of them would be taken in and have their visas revoked with a ban on entry to follow , all the ukrainians are let go , the customs get off the train and on we go . 
  and then the smugglers dig up several more bags the customs still had somehow missed ( even though they had picked up dozens and dozens of those bags ) . 
  i do n't know , but my faith in the system faltered a little then . 
  not sure how i felt about the people involved , as i can see both positive pluses and negative pluses , to borrow a phrase from wa\u0142\u0119sa , of what had happened . 
  rip . 
  what !? 
  ca n't hear you over the sound of how nuts these guys were !,

  you may be * high * on the * feeling-low * list , but you 're really * low * on the * high-importance offences * list . 
  now , it 's all a matter of working out a proper balance . 
  oh , come on - you 've come top of the list , that 's got ta count for something , no ? 
  remember : the first shall be the last , or something to that effect . 
   on vacations i guess that makes them off-duty by definition .

  careful there with that tsunami of an emotional outpouring - too much love will kill you , doncha know . 
  complacency is a bitch . 
  i should know , i live in poland and look at what happened - a total upset of the political balance of power because the previous government got complacent over how things were not falling to bits ( some things were not so good , others were decently okayish , for the record ) . 
  the fact that the vast majority of you are living a peaceful life in a rich and developed country might be a deceptive charade built on ignorance and bad things not affecting you personally , yet . 
  or maybe things are fine , and there 's no need to panic . 
  wait and see , wait and see . 
  one example was [ the trial of the sixteen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trial_of_the_sixteen ) . 
  speaking of which , how come there was such a fuss about this norwegian `` occupied '' tv series in september when they announced it , and absolutely no discussion about it on here that i could see ? 
  i 've seen the series ( i missed the last two episodes i think ) , but it was upsettingly bad . 
  we 'll see if this one is as painfully propagandistic and forced as djupvik 's adventures were . 
  ... but it is only with finland that you make a complete fornication apparatus . 
  i fully support your motion to have 3d prints of their genitals made as a requirement of registration !, 
  i have literally nothing to say here . 
  and by saying `` we '' you mean the un - so yeah , maybe the eu countries should jointly push for amending the refugee conventions while we ( the eu this time ) still have some pull in the security council , eh ? 
  oh , wait , this would be in the plenary , would n't it - can we outvote asia , africa ? 
  do you reckon we can rely on the americas ? 
  quick , count the votes , notify the whip and time to start mounting our offensive . 
  shit , the un looked like such a good idea at the time ... 
  absolutely agree . 
  definitely the hardest read in the last decade for me - and not that the style is bad , actually ( not honeyed words , either , for sure ) . 
  it 's just that the book is so unimaginably bitter and scathing in its portrayal of a post-colonial capitalist society being guilt-ridden into the ground that when juxtaposed with the current events , it becomes an eerie nightmare . 
  hell , everyone gets it in this book - the journalist ( left and right-wingers ) , the clergy , the capitalists , the simple folk , the sophisticated folk ... and so on and so on . 
  do recommend . 
  actually , i think he is a time traveller who just cleverly disguised his book as apparent bunkum . 
  it 's a bloody documentary , not fiction . 
  while it may be true to a certain extent , you 'd be blind and ignorant to believe that there has been a right-extremist take-over . 
  the mods are not right-extremist , a large portion of the user-base is not - so where is the devil ? 
  but seriously , the problem is - back in september , upon seeing the scale of the influx of people , many were voicing concerns and were saying that further down the road it would lead to things like cologne ( and all the other cities ) and then this . 
  there was an excellently lucid comment bullet-pointing a road-map into madness - i wish i could find it , but being pressed for time , i ca n't now , but basically it said - `` there 'll be protests , there 'll be crimes committed by the immigrants , there 'll be back-lash attacks , there 'll be back-lash from the immigrants , there 'll be chaos in the streets '' . 
  the comment ended stating that the author hoped we 'd find a way to stop it at protests from the locals . 
  we have n't - attacks from the immigrants have happened and were quickly followed by attacks on immigrants . 
  do you want this to go further down this spiral of violence toward what many were scoffing at back in september - chaos in the streets tantamount to civil war ? 
  do you really ? 
  and no , whatever you choose to believe , i am not a racist and there is nothing i 'd like to see more than a non-violent solution to this entire problem . 
  and no , lack of limits on the immigrant influx does not constitute a solution in my eyes . 
  i have been wondering about the motives for not reporting on it in august and then suddenly wanting to report it now . 
  apart from the obvious reasons of guilt and pangs of conscience , one tentative hypothesis i 'd like to offer up for digestion is this : what if this ( along with the matter-of-course reports of anti-immigrant backlash in the form of direct attacks against `` brown people '' ) is part of a media counter-attack . 
  when saying that there are no problems no longer suffices , the narrative shifts to saying ( if you read between the lines ; or someone will smartly point this out for you , if you do n't ) that it 's not the recent immigrants ( since this is from august , ergo before the faecal matter explosively collided with a ventilation device - both in terms of the sudden media focus through late august/september and cologne recently ) , so they ca n't be blamed ( which , they , naturally ca n't be , if they are indeed innocent ) . 
  meaning the current immigrants are all fine ( unless they do something like cologne , but that 's just fringe cases , really , no honest ) . 
  really , as a pole - and europe had a beef with polish democracy for what exactly ? 
  feel free to post your * critique * . 
  i 'm sorry , but if you know both polish and english , then i do n't see how you ca n't understand him - even if he copies polish syntax with english words , it 's really not that hard to figure out what he was trying to say . 
  as for your other plea - maybe take it up with the moderators , see if there 's any traction for that ? 
  that posters should be able to present some sort of english language certification to be allowed to post ? 
  make it into a rule , perhaps ? 
  i understand how you feel , but i encourage you not to give up and to stay in sweden and work to change your country for the better and undo the regress that has taken place over the years . 
  find people who also care about your country and stay strong . 
  yeah , but for the eu parliament we use `` przewodnicz\u0105cy '' , not `` marsza\u0142ek '' . 
  cool , cool . 
  just making sure we 're all on the same page .

  have you read the article before commenting ? 
  read the article , before commenting , do n't you know [ reddiquette ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) ? 
  really , read the article ( and edit your initial comment afterwards , or something ) . 
  maybe his face was all awry when he typed that , his visage distorted beyond any semblance of his true self ? 
  yeah , i 'm thinking about that communist shit-hole of gdr , with their stazi , and their nazi , and their pazzi , and their * fugazi * , and i 'm kinda sorta ready to agree ... 
  i mean , did gdr even go through a proper accession procedure or did they slink in through [ the back door ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk_ilymwo4s ) , like in [ that infamous beatles song ] ( https://youtu.be/pdadbmrod9c?t=1m3s ) ? 
  good lord , has the e been in an illicit union all this time !? 
  controversial ? 
  dayum , son , i mean i 've knowingly and intentionally made controversial comments before , but this one ? 
  it jist ai n't no one of them !, 
  unless yo ass be tellin ' me / u/zombiepiratefrspace is fo ' real the source of info for polish media regarding the status of polish citizens who may have been injured/killed in accidents/terror attacks . 
  you ca n't deny that [ shocktroops ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/elitemooks ) + [ flamethrowers ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/firebreathingweapon ) would be pretty damned [ badass ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/badass ) to the max , though , can you ? 
  yes , i guess normally it 's the ambassadors ' and consuls ' purview and it was an exceptional situation for which waszczykowski took the reins off whoever is in the federal republic . 
  ( like i wrote earlier - why not score a free hit , if there 's an opportunity to do so ), 
  ooh , edgy - angelic frau merkel as unemployable as immigrants without the language or necessary vocational backgrounds ? 
  ouch . 
  do you have any information regarding whether the polish government inquired about the safety of polish citizens after the paris attacks , or not ? 
  i can say that it 's a routine thing for news outlets in poland to report on whether any polish citizens were harmed whenever there 's a tragic accident , or a terror attack - and they must be getting that info from somewhere . 
  i wonder where from - you ?
