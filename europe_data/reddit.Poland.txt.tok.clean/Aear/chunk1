first of all , i live in germany and pay loads of taxes , so i think i 'd be driving for free . 
  you 're twisting the point : i 'm in favor of tolls , but for everyone . 
  germans , polish , americans , swiss ( especially  ) , italians etc. 
  just as it is the case in other transit countries where all drivers are equal . 
  if a toll will help preserve the quality of german roads then it 's a great idea . 
  moreover , it might coerce more people to use public transportation , be it buses or trains . 
  i doubt that the eu will be ok with this . 
  the reason the proposed bill wants the tolls only for foreigners is because the coalition made a deal that a toll will be in place but the adac , audi & co. are totally against it . 
  germans love their cars and their highways but they sure as hell are not going to pay for the latter . 
  that will never gain approval in the public . 
  foreigners ? 
  maybe ... you get your cake , eat it and make some else pay for it , too . 
  the foreigners pay the tolls in their countries , too . 
  it 's not like it 's just germans ... 
  i feel you . 
  i was an exchange student in ireland and i had to fill in some forms with that exact requirement . 
  add to that having any form of accent or special letter in your name . 
  xubuntu with xfce ( which is wonderfully fast ) . 
  you 're not in germany maybe ? 
  it 's the official one alright . 
  my second favorite form was one where i could not for the love of me find germany , deutschland , brd , bundesrepublik deutschland , or the federal republic of germany . 
  it turned out i should have been looking for alemanya -- one out of 4 countries on the list with non-english country names . 
  ( un ) fortunately it is , i made sure : / what is even weirder is that i currently live in germany ... how did they know ? 
  it stands for turkish nationalist party . 
  my so is voting tomorrow and has been complaining that the alternatives are : 1 . 
  the corrupt populist party gerb 2 . 
  communists 3 . 
  turks 4 . 
  gerb 's younger brother 5 . 
  communist 's younger brother 6 . 
  populist mixture of far-right and left 7 . 
  two far right/extremist parties 8 . 
  fringe parties, 
  yeah , yeah , yeah , sure . 
  next thing you know you 'll say you even came up with the entire cyrillic alphabet . 
  what i found ticks them off most is to say that they use the russian alphabet ... 
  i love how lublin is included , but not wroclaw ( for example on the way to prague ) . 
  ** do ** properly segregate the trash . 
  ** do n't ** expect to find an open shop on a sunday . 
  if you 're lucky you might find a bakery . 
  oh my god , i have been assimilated o_o, 
  as is tradition . 
  i happen to teach and conduct research at a state uni , yes . 
  not in poland thankfully . 
  let me sum up my points , because it irks me and i 've read too many essays today . 
  the point of the commercial is lost on most people or not immediately clear . 
  bad commercial . 
  the website address is not memorable , even after repeated exposure . 
  bad commercial . 
  the ad calls for checking the bus registration numbers to see if it 's safe . 
  good . 
  penalty -- according to the ad , since i have no further information at this point -- destruction . 
  hence , if you 're outdated and fail at fitting in , you are a worthless piece of garbage to be recycled . 
  the message here is conform and be young , because sick and old people are worthless ; not worthy of treatment or repairing . 
  i urge you to see how older people are treated in hospitals in poland -- strikingly similar . 
  did they release a commercial about a potentially healthy looking bus that may kill your children ? 
  the profiling is quite clear , i 'm afraid . 
  all the nice buses are white . 
  yes , there is a lot racism in poland . 
  several of my friends with darker skin , more ethnic clothing etc. 
  reported being not only verbally abused but also beaten up when vacationing in poland . 
  not the case for the white male friends . 
  women are a different discussion whatsoever . 
  following from the previous point : a white bus looks fine and will not be suspected . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but does anyone check the buses numbers when it pulls into the bus stop with the children ? 
  i do n't recall such a thing . 
  they see the bus and scream . 
  appearances matter . 
  if your answer boils down to `` you 're wrong , ** i ** see no racism and discrimination of the elderly and you 're stoopid '' then spare me the answer , please . 
  of course they give the address in the spot . 
  the point is : i watched the video twice and did n't remember it . 
  i feel like we 're speaking different languages . 
  you seem to not understand me and claim i do n't understand you ( which well may be ) . 
  let me try this then : if this ad is so effective , what is the website address where you can check those numbers ? 
  i 've seen this spot twice and have no idea . 
  for this reason alone it failed its purpose . 
  2/10 university students i teach will google things . 
  the rest asks multiple times ( in addition to not being able to read ) . 
  if the bus is repaired and functional , i see no problem with going on a trip with it . 
  i 've traveled enough times with eurobus to know that white and shiny does not mean functional . 
  appearances can be deceiving and the spot completely ignores that . 
  i see this more as a danger . 
  `` this bus looks new . 
  no worries ! '', 
  i got the intended message but it came third to other observations , making it a bad spot . 
  commercials are tested on so called `` idiot groups '' to see if random people get the message . 
  if it requires more than 10 s of thought they did a bad job . 
  * no parent in their right mind * sends a kid on a shady looking bus . 
  i 'm willing to bet that those get reported more . 
  the buses that do n't look it are more dangerous imho . 
  the real questions are why are all the shiny buses white ( the old ikarus being the one colored ) and why not fix stuff ? 
  what stayed in my head is `` kill old people !, 
  they 're useless , dangerous and wasteful !, 
  spend , do n't mend !, 
  euthanasia them all ! '', 
  to me the message is more like `` do n't repair , buy a new bus ! '', 
  -  spend , do n't mend . 
  this is also metaphorical of how we treat old people is this country ( and much of the western world ) . 
  they could have just made the bus a pozer or douche . 
  ah yes , the obligatory `` go back to your own country '' comment .
