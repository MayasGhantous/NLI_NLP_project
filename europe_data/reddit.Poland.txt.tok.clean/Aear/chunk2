  good news for you is that i 'll likely move to a different country eventually , because i 'm a scientist and we move a lot . 
   the official tasks of the unemployment agency may include `` helping the needy '' but their unofficial task is to give them as little as possible . 
  so them not telling you this is expected . 
  my so 's mother was an immigrant . 
  she was denied child care benefits . 
  the official told her that that is because `` that money is only for germans ! '', 
  this was a lie . 
  she found out years later when my so was almost 18 . 
  the state payed her child care benefits for 5 years because everything beyond that was outdated . 
  i was told i was obliged by law to have a haftpflichtversicherung . 
  that 's a lie . 
  my previous cellphone provider lied to me ( thankfully on the phone , which they recorded and i had evidence ) and charged me a lot of money . 
  i had no say in the kind of room i got at the university dorms and was told i needed to pay rent for 1-2 months before i went there , because otherwise they could not guarantee a room . 
  none of my many german friends had to do that and they got to choose one of 3 different rooms . 
  racism is alive and well on administrative levels in bw . 
  in saxen , brandenburg and hessen -- racism can greet you in the shops and bakeries , too . 
   it is obviously not too complex for people from the middle east or africa who can not even speak german . 
  it is too complex for people who speak little german unless they know someone who can help them . 
  sure , there are some social workers walking the streets and helping the poor , but they 're too few and outreach programs are scarce . 
  most programs i know of are food banks and offer no legal help . 
  also -- what do you do if you 're lied to ? 
  you get screwed over unless you get lucky . 
  maybe that 's the case . 
  i would n't know , i was never told i had the option . 
  in fact , i was told very few things and the information i had was incomplete . 
  btw , just a couple of minutes ago i called for that 15 eur they owe me . 
  lo and behold - not only have they done nothing about my ( 2.5 month old ) opened case , but my appeal time of 4 weeks is now over by a fair margin . 
  i ought to have appealed , the guy said . 
  i called them 3 or 4 weeks ago about the same thing and they told me to wait . 
  i am a bitch and will see this through but i imagine a lot of people give up at the application form , which has a lot of hard to understand questions ( in addition to the regular beh\u00f6rdendeutsch , * administration german * , notoriously known for it 's `` simplicity '' ) . 
  ~ ~ afaik only if you pay a sozialversicherung for at least a year before . 
  then you 're entitled to receive benefits for 12 months . ~ ~ i stand corrected . 
  i was unemployed for a month ( between jobs ) and thought `` why do n't i get arbeitslosengeld ? 
  i payed the taxes for 3 years , so i should get something . '', 
  that 's part of the deal - i had to pay for at least a year to get the benefits . 
  furthermore , since my unemployment came suddenly , i had no way to register 3 months in advance . 
  i did provide a solid reason ( + documents ) why this was so , but i still got a deduction for registering late . 
  not to mention all the paperwork , waiting and disinformation that accompanied the entire process . 
  now , i 'm not a german citizen , but i have been living here for almost 9 years and have the zop-certificate ( c2 level afaik ) but i had to bring my german so along to understand what they wanted from me . 
  an added bonus was that some social workers themselves spoke worse german than i did . 
  yay . 
  the kind of money i got was waaaay too little for me to pay rent , electricity , telephone bills and food ( bw , south-west of germany ) . 
  had i not had savings , i 'd be out on the streets . 
  bottom line - it 's a lot harder than you think . 
  i used to share your opinion but now i 'm not so sure . 
  also - the agentur f\u00fcr arbeit owns me 15 euro and i 'm pissed enough to get it from them , no matter how long it takes !, 
  no vodka or beer , no football and no manual labor for me . 
  not blond , either . 
  then again i did emigrate , so i 've got that going for me . 
  well , that did n't stick . 
  the german [ `` die partei '' ] ( http://www.die-partei.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tittenalternativ_europa2014_din-a2-212x300.jpg ) got [ a seat in the eu parlament ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/europawahl/europawahl-2014-die-partei-im-europaparlamaent-12958390.html ) ( de ) . 
  they said `` they want to milk the eu like a small southern european state . '', 
  i wonder whether [ edvard hund ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--o8ii3wti10/u2owwswhppi/aaaaaaaacl4/u3fyx_ou-5y/s1600/img_7775.jpg ) got any votes . 
  we 're used to our votes not counting for anything . 
  the party always got 99.9 % of the votes anyway . 
  i 'm so ashamed , this is not what my parents fought for :(, 
  maybe i 'm not getting something here , but in my understanding the comedy comes from the clash of the hypothesis `` europe is rotten , russia is pure '' with the empirical evidence ( henceforth called reality ) . 
  the reality is expressed in the comparison of the means of various factors that were chosen arbitrarily to disprove this hypothesis . 
  the method is , however , flawed in that the measures used in no clear way correspond to the postulated decadence of europe , which the author implies . 
  to sum up , we regret to inform that the paper was not accepted for publication in the journal of reasonable shit . 
  we urge the author to revise this paper and conduct further research with newer data and a wider , better justified selection of variables , 
  i 'm the last person to think kindly about putin but i get my panties in a twist when i see implication with the intent to deceive . 
  heck , i wrote an ma on this topic  maybe this was not the case here -- in which case i 'm baffled by the amount of downvotes i got . 
  those are some strong and funny correlations . 
  data can be very misleading , especially if presented like this . 
  best examples of this are bar graphs or relative frequencies without the information about missing values . 
  even with error bars -- unless you read the axis labels carefully and actually know what the difference between sem and two std devs is -- you 're going to think , `` oh my , that is such a big/small difference ! '', 
  the `` infographic '' implies that -- contrary what russian propaganda is pushing -- the west has it better because it 's liberal , unlike conservative russia . 
  however , that is not a simple relation of more liberal -  better life . 
  there are many intervening factors , such as state of health care , industrialization , social welfare , distribution of wealth , etc. 
  [ correlation does not imply causation . 
  ] ( http://www.tylervigen.com/ ) edit : yes , yes , russia bad , austria good . 
  [ why ?!, 
  ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrtu8u9akb1qgy2f0.gif ), 
  yeah , or poland ? 
  scare tactics , nice work !, 
  not facts . 
  if i understand you correctly , you are assuming that the existing market would not change ? 
  no new startups , government funded programs ? 
  also , that is not a peer reviewed journal . 
  try journal of economics , journal of political economy , journal of politics , perspectives on politics or [ any of these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_science_journals ) or [ these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_economics_journals ) . 
  so immigration should not be unchecked , ok , issue documents to immigrants . 
  since ( hypothetically ) we 're letting them all in , there are no problems with them trying to get in illegally ( we know where they are ) . 
  the state would pay for their residence , probably by raising taxes , but new jobs would be created - in education , social work , health sector . 
  hey , europe is getting old and retirement age is going up , i have no reason to believe immigration would be so bad . 
  unless someone actually posts facts and not opinions to make me change my mind -_-, 
  nope , the question that i have asked and has not been answered is why is this so bad ? 
  not why you think it 's bad , why you fear it , etc. 
  but why is it bad . 
  hard facts please , no newspapers and such . 
  no source for this ? 
  why would i trust the opinion of a stranger who might be pulling this out of his ass . 
  maybe you 're a political scientist , sociologist , god know what , but i ca n't know that . 
  honestly , why is no one giving me one * solid source ? 
  peer reviewed journal , not blog/newspaper/political party statement . 
  * it is common practice to not trust any results unless they have been replicated thrice , so i 'm being really lax here . 
  the guardian is not a peer reviewed journal and not science . 
  it 's popular opinion . 
  that student is no researcher either . 
  as little as i hold political `` science '' in esteem , there 's got to be something to back up these claims here .
