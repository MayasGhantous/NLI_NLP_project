  otherwise - immigration may be good or bad , so let 's toss a coin . 
  ok , so raise taxes a bit , but would n't more jobs be created - housing , education , healthcare , etc. 
  this is not an explanation . 
  as far as i 'm concerned poland can take on this refugees . 
  like i said -- i 'm trying to understand what is so bad about it . 
  hey , who knows , might make our government increase spending on healthcare , which would be nice . 
  why - and this in an honest question - is immigration so bad ? 
  why not just let them all in ? 
  edit : apparently people dislike this question . 
  i 'm gon na need some sources for all those claims you 're making that `` shit will go down the drain '' . 
  i 'm a scientist , you need to prove your theories . 
  edit 2 : the more i read the comments and the more i think about it , i observe two things : ( a ) no one can prove to me why immigration is bad ; ( b ) i 'm starting to see more upsides of immigration . 
  poland 's doing some wishful thinking . 
  i would maybe not say `` man '' but `` person . '', 
  women can be abusive , too ( i am one , i would know  ) . 
  the only difference between me ( the netherlands ) and my bf ( estonia ) is that i have a tablet . 
  great humor , awful tourists , scones are the thing , nice fashion , good health care , need to be the special snowflake of europe . 
  fuck cyrillic handwritten , really , it was concocted by trolls . 
  \u0422 is not m !, 
  -_- '' edit : i 'm joking , my bf is bulgarian and i 'm having problems with cursive . 
  not immediately . 
  are you saying poland can have london ? 
  we would like to annex it before the bulgarians and romanians get there . 
  a friend of mine has a 1 room flat a bit out of town . 
  700-800 eur i believe . 
  coal is so much better , right ? 
  much safer for the environment and people 's health . 
  right ? 
  o_o you have now convinced me never to go to sweden , / u/tentaclesofdoom , 
  that may be but you can never know whether the victim of violence will tell you ( or anyone else ) about it . 
  i agree with you and i did n't mean to single out poland . 
  i do n't know enough about the scale of violence in other countries to contest their numbers , 
  i can speak for izery , podlasie and tatry , mazury less so . 
  source : that 's where i either lived or have close family . 
  those numbers are nowhere near accurate for poland . 
  in several regions , especially rural areas , hitting your wife sometimes because she deserves it does not count as actual violence . 
  a couple of years ago a polish tv station ( tvp , i think ) was interviewing people about their new year 's resolutions and `` hit the wife less '' came up twice int he broadcast . 
  that 's a bit early . 
  that 's the point - we 're secretly shitting our pants because we know europe will do nothing unless we start protesting early . 
  i feel you and i mean this in the nicest way possible , but losing poland was not worth starting two world wars , right ally ? 
  i guess we 're all a little afraid , 
  oh yeah waiting for 4 hours at the swiss border - always a pleasure  where are you going ? 
  why ? 
  for how long ? 
  - that 's none of your business ? 
  btw . 
  this is one of the reasons i hate traveling to the us . 
  my biggest first world problem now will be that i ca n't pop over to stein am rhein and buy cheese . 
  i 'm polish and my boyfriend is bulgarian so fuck . 
  if i 'm understanding you correctly , you would rather have more swiss employees than better skilled employees from elsewhere ? 
  i 'm a scientist and i was considering moving to zurich but i guess i 'll stay ( in germany ) or move to the netherlands . 
  are you more into hiking ( alps , scotland , bulgaria , poland , slovenia , czech republic , ... ) , chilling in warm places ( italy , france , ireland , spain , greece , croatia , ... ) or city hopping ( rome , paris , berlin , madrid , amsterdam , prague , cracow , dubrovnik , ... ) ? 
  food , omg cheese , veggies , yogurt , salads , also nature - beautiful mountains , beaches filled with russians and germans , orthodox and full of monks , monasteries , were nice to jews during wwii , friendly people , but lots of corruption , have gypsy problems ( mostly because everyone is poor , roma are marginalized and blamed for lots of things , if they emigrate their status is difficult , esp . 
  heath insurance ) , invest in green energy , used to make computers , complain and gesticulate a lot ( i can never tell if they 're having a fight or sharing a joke ) ... ok , i could go on forever . 
  my bf is bulgarian ... 
  awesome landscape .
