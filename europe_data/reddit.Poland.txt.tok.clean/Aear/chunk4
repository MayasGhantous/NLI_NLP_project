  oh yeah , it takes me more time to type on an azerty keyboard than my boyfriend 's us dvorak layout keyboard . 
  never seen qwertz in poland 0_0, 
  not technically wrong , but i think they meant that there was no belarus , lithuania or ukraine to the east . 
  maybe i 'm wrong about that , but hungary is no longer poland 's neighbour . 
  they thought poland is next to russia and to the west next to hungary . 
  haha , then eastern polska is coming to you !, 
  i 'm relieved to see that [ poland is not counted as sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93swedish_wars ) . 
  can confirm . 
  fianc\u00e9 got a german citizenship and transitioned from getting up at 9-10 am to 6:30 am on weekdays . 
  sleeping in means 8 am now . 
  thanks , that clears up my confusion , 
  i always thought that `` t\u00e1 '' meant `` i am . '', 
  is n't the answer to `` did you go home last night ? '', 
  either `` i went '' or `` i did n't go '' ? 
  poland got probably kicked out :|, 
  good bot !, 
  here , take my sad upvote . 
  funny , i was going to say 1/2 very right and 1/2 very left . 
  not according to the graphs i got from the stadtwerke when moved in to my new apartment . 
  the really sad part is that i live in a very green town . 
  there is so much truth in your comment that i can not understand why people keep on downvoting you . 
  ... and yet germany still is powered to 90 % by fossil fuels , which do much more harm to the environment . 
  there is no `` best '' political system , otherwise we 'd hear about the nobel prise award for whoever came up with it . 
  pray that it is n't the us . 
  i have ( a friend of mine comes from cyprus ) and from what she told me it is now a rather peaceful and very expensive country , but warm and very pretty . 
  there 's big money involved with wars . 
  it does not really matter whether osama had anything to do with it as long as people believe he did and are willing to invest in an outrageous manhunt . 
  and how many thousands of other people did they kill at the same time ? 
  no mention . 
  how many innocent civilians did they slaughter out of fear they * might * have ever had anything to do with osama ? 
  it 's morbid . 
  oh man , you made me hungry now ... italian coffee , awww ... 
  buy any generic healthy cereals . 
  get a packet or two of nuts . 
  buy fruit . 
  get honey . 
  anything else you fancy . 
  my boyfriend and i make our own breakfast mix . 
  we cut up 1 fruit every morning , mix it with nuts and cereals ( and anything else we feel like ) and sweeten with honey . 
  healthy + yummy + fed + allows for daily variety . 
   with all due respect - what the fuck did you expect ?!, 
  how do look at your country 's map and history and go - `` there 's too much immigrants '' . 
  so true , so very very true :d, 
  what adds to the irony of it all , german , russian and polish neo-nazis are apparently friends . 
  i sometimes wonder how their logic works . 
  there was a documentary about it ( called `` polscy neonazisci '' i believe ) but : 1 . 
  it 's in polish . 
  can not find video link . 
  ... and you implied i was biased . 
  this is the kind of attitude i was trying to describe , 
  i said `` former '' . 
  i used to live very close to the border and the german polizei was usually very harsh to polish people ( `` why are you going to germany ? 
  what will you do there ? 
  how long will you stay ? 
  open your bags ! '' ) . 
  i had a warm and tingling feeling after we joined the eu and polish people stopped buying stuff from german supermarkets . 
  bautzen and g\u00f6rlitz were dead cities for a couple of years , 
  the former ddr citizens are not very fond of poles anyway , especially in the border regions . 
  still waiting for that to change -_- even after poland joined the schengen zone they kept some of the borders operating for several months . 
  sure thing . 
  unless they are displaying their heritage in some immediately apparent way , i will most likely not take notice of their `` non-europeanness '' . 
  no can has read bulgarian , but will forward to boyfriend . 
  edit : boyfriend already says he would not be surprised if this were true . 
  lol , you need to gain some perspective on poland . 
  i emigrated 6 years ago because i wanted very specific education ( one which i could not get at home ) and now i come to visit my family twice a year . 
  due to this i have gained perspective which enables me to see all the good stuff happening . 
  you know , it is there . 
  stuff actually is getting better . 
  innit awesome ? 
  btw . 
  about the ticket controllers - i have seen far too often them being abused and threatened by punks without a ticket . 
  hell , i 've even seen a controller get thrown out of a bus ( poor guy landed head first ) . 
  seriously ? 
  if you do n't have a ticket , pay the price or walk . 
  you know that riding without a ticket and then running away is breaking the law , right ? 
  erm ... that is not what i said and i do believe we 're doing fine . 
  i think it 's mostly cause the younger generations are tired of that `` it 's the fault of the germans/russians '' crap . 
  this is kinda funny because from the `` inside '' of poland we 're all like `` ah , this country is going to hell '' etc. 
  no , please , no usa !, 
  those people are crazy !, 
  no funny points for you,
