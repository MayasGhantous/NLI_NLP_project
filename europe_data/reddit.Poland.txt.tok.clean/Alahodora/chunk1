i think we actually have a very similar opinion on this . 
  thank you , and a nice evening to you too . 
  keeping it cool is letting bad things happen . 
  keeping it cool is what led us to the reality where government is taking control of courts , flushing women 's rights down the toilet and destroying constitutional tribunal . 
  forgive me if i completely disagree with you on that matter . 
  change does n't happen just because we wait . 
  it happens because we keep acting . 
  if education and fact-checking is so forceful then sorry , but i wo n't help them staying in the bubble . 
  call it what you may . 
  i believe that this attitute is passive and damaging . 
  good luck to you , i 'm gon na go my way now . 
   i feel like we call everybody who acts like a dick , a troll and it 's starts to lose its meaning . 
  i quess you 're right about that . 
   if anything , i think they will be in danger if they come here against the wishes of majority of people , it 'll fuel hatred , further degrade our not so good image on international scene and cause all sorts of cultural problems even tough it 's a silly number of people , which actually does n't help italy or greece at all apart from making silly solidarity act where real solutions are needed . 
  and last but not least it gives pis support , which is probably the worst thing . 
  so you 're saying we should isolate ourselves and that is going to make this situation just solve itself ? 
   we are isolated society with sad history and we 've been free for relatively short time . 
  that 's why we 're so easily manipulated into fearing other cultures - we know close to nothing about them . 
  i am not saying we should reject the opinion of people and take everyone in by force . 
  i 'm saying ** we should improve on delievering checked information and stop demonizing other cultures ** . 
  there are [ studies on how muslims are misrepresented in the media ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/terror-attacks-media-coverage-muslim-islamist-white-racism-islamophobia-study-georgia-state-a7820726.html ) . 
  most of the people who hate on muslims have n't even met one in their life . 
  there 's been news about a man who cut another one 's head off , man who beat up a woman and her boyfriend because he was british and another about a man who 's been set on fire . 
  was it a different culture ? 
  they were all polish with beautiful christian background . 
  think about it . 
  liberal values are not up to someone 's prefference . 
  they 're clearly defined . 
   * liberalism * is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of ** liberty and equality ** . 
  liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles , but generally they support ideas and programmes such as ** freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , free markets , civil rights , democratic societies , secular governments , gender equality , and international cooperation ** . 
   * liberalism * includes a broad spectrum of political philosophies that consider individual ** liberty to be the most important political goal ** , and emphasize individual rights and equality of opportunity . 
  although most liberals would claim that a ** government is necessary to protect rights ** , different forms of liberalism may propose very different policies . 
  they are , however , generally united by their support for a number of principles , including extensive freedom of thought and freedom of speech , limitations on the power of governments , the application of the rule of law , a market economy ( or a mixed economy with both private-owned and state-owned enterprises ) and a ** transparent and democratic system of government ** . 
  facts are not up to personal preferences . 
  by liberal values you mean respecting one another , accepting differences and being open towards one another ? 
  nothing to do with foreign relations indeed . 
  like i said , i did n't say all the people who think differently are trolls . 
  i do have a hard time believing that people who are genuinely afraid would go around the internet and viciously instult everyone who disagrees with them . 
  look up any thread concerning current events on twitter , the amount of hate and contempt is disgusting . 
  they 're free to call us liberal whores , wishing rape on us for supporting people in need and telling us to kill ourselves but i ca n't call it trolling ? 
  please , tell me how should i call them , i 'll gladly expand my vocabulary . 
  no sarcasm here . 
   sometimes if they are not ready for something , it 's better to just let it go , otherwise you create problems where there were none before . 
  why do you think they 're not ready ? 
  have we been attacked by refugees in any way ? 
  are we flooded with dangerous immigrants ? 
  no , we 're not . 
  but the media love to fuel this narrative . 
  this is what creating problems out of nowhere truly looks like . 
  if you believe it 's best to let things go that 's your right . 
  i believe we should point out lies when we see them . 
  and i will . 
  never said that . 
  and i know very well what it means . 
  i welcome healthy discussion but twisting facts , personal attacks and spreading lies is not one . 
  and there 's plenty of it , especially on the internet . 
  would n't you agree ? 
  yes , we are better off economically because we were able to make good deals with our neighbours and accepted their help . 
  being isolated and uncooperative is not very profitable . 
  i not once said they were evil , you did . 
  and you did n't answer my question . 
  seems like it 's working out pretty amazing for them . 
  funny how quick are we to forget how much we owe eu . 
  but yeah , national pride eh ? 
  thank you for saying that . 
  trolls are very loud but your words and actions are not lost on many of us . 
  i 'm sorry that so many of poles fail to see it . 
  i 'm sorry we 're making such trouble . 
  it 's hard to fight against this fear so fueled by the media . 
  i know i ca n't even convince some of my friends , it goes so deep ... 
  facts are a reliable source . 
  is he a member of pis or not ? 
  simple question . 
  yeah , they 're all commies , i know . 
  so you 're saying he 's not a member of pis ? 
  [ is this biased too ? 
  if i can point to you to the sources saying he 's outright lying it can either mean he 's a liar or he 's uneducated . 
  take your pick . 
  i said nothing about morals but nice try . 
  [ i 'm sure he 's a 100 % unbiased member of pis ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/7,75398,21297740,kandydat-pis-prof-banaszak-wybrany-na-sedziego-trybunalu.html ) he 's [ twisting facts about germany ] ( https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2016/05/how-judges-are-selected-in-germany/ ) by spreading a lie that this reform is somehow normal because ` many western countries do the same ' . 
  [ they do n't . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/search?q=zamach%20lipcowy&amp;src=tyah ) he 's saying that judges handpicked by one member of pis is ` pretty much the same ' because ` they 're not going to be unbiased anyway ' . 
  he 's saying that judges being picked by krs is exactly the same as ziobro picking them . 
  he 's also saying that the president is vastly respected among the people . 
  [ ups , does n't seem so . 
  ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/opinie/zaufanie-do-prezydenta-andrzeja-dudy-poparcie-dla-andrzeja-dudy,artykuly,386188,1.html ) seems like a great expert on the subject , indeed !, 
  [ let me show you what professors think . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckhsol3b20c ) stop spreading bullshit . 
  people here are not stupid . 
  it is a well known fact that reality has a liberal bias . 
   but i think there is in poland , because pis controls the state owned media companies . 
  yep . 
  they 're unbelievably shameless . 
  some people buy it , as presented above . 
  for example , why do people defend the courts now ? 
  because they 're salty for loosing their money . 
  they 're against justice actually . 
  enemies of the nation . 
  and there are n't thousands . 
  hundreds actually .
