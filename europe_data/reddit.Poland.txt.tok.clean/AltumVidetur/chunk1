jkm is basically like one of those crazy american republicans transplanted onto an european political scene . 
  that is , socialized healthcare is satan , taxes equal theft , privatize everything , guns for everybody , etc. 
  my username is finally relevant !, 
  [ fallacy man to the rescue !, 
  ] ( http://existentialcomics.com/comic/9 ), 
  all true . 
  but that does not mean that the other guys are in the right . 
  this is not a black and white issue . 
  being anti-pis does not equal being pro-po , and vice versa . 
  there is no lesser evil to choose here . 
  both evils are just as bad , but in different ways . 
  so the current government really is controlled by * them * , and * they * really want to destroy the country by forcibly sex-changing our children in kindergarten and making them gay ? 
  i do n't think that was on the tapes . 
   tl ; dr : i was too young to remeber well , but from what i read and heard , pis was n't as bad as po and most of negative hype was generated by opposing media . 
  they tried to crown jesus as king of poland , ffs . 
  to this day po is winning every single election for exactly one reason - people are voting against pis . 
   on the other hand , i heard that there were some minor affairs , especially with over sensitivity to corruption that would be good if they did n't go after innocent people in order to be seen doing something . 
  not really . 
  po may be a bunch of conmen and crooks , but pis ( most of them ) are legitimately insane . 
  it 's what / r/conspiracy would be , if it were a political party . 
  there is literally nobody worth voting for in this country . 
  i believe [ these guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reply_of_the_zaporozhian_cossacks ) knew how to respond to this kind of thing . 
   zaporozhian cossacks to the turkish sultan !, 
    o sultan , turkish devil and damned devil 's kith and kin , secretary to lucifer himself . 
  what the devil kind of knight are you , that ca n't slay a hedgehog with your naked arse ? 
  the devil excretes , and your army eats . 
  you will not , you son of a bitch , make subjects of christian sons ; we 've no fear of your army , by land and by sea we will battle with thee , fuck your mother . 
    you babylonian scullion , macedonian wheelwright , brewer of jerusalem , goat-fucker of alexandria , swineherd of greater and lesser egypt , pig of armenia , podolian thief , catamite of tartary , hangman of kamyanets , and fool of all the world and underworld , an idiot before god , grandson of the serpent , and the crick in our dick . 
  pig 's snout , mare 's arse , slaughterhouse cur , unchristened brow , screw your own mother !, 
    so the zaporozhians declare , you lowlife . 
  you wo n't even be herding pigs for the christians . 
  now we 'll conclude , for we do n't know the date and do n't own a calendar ; the moon 's in the sky , the year with the lord , the day 's the same over here as it is over there ; for this kiss our arse !, 
    koshovyi otaman ivan sirko , with the whole zaporozhian host . 
  holy crap . 
  i never thought i 'd see the day when i would agree with / u/magadget 's opinion on anything , but here we are ... 
  nah , he 's polish , so he 's probably from wykop , the digg clone that got overrun by , ahem , < air quotes  * race realists * and * true patriots * < / air quotes  a few years ago . 
  if i recall correctly , on the day of anders breivik 's shooting spree the highest upvoted comment there was something like `` at least it 's leftist cunts that got shot and not real people '' . 
   upped social benefits for parents of handicapped children actually they took away the benefits from all caretakers of handicapped people that had more than 753 pln of monthly income , and they only restored them for the parents of handicapped children after they took to the streets . 
  the constitutional tribunal had to force them to also restore the benefits to those taking care of their disabled elder family members . 
   ok so we cleared that one . 
  you did n't have to lick anyone 's boots . 
  for the record , governments of smaller countries always lick someone 's boots . 
  it just seems that the euroboot and the american boot suits your taste better . 
  indeed , as much as i dislike the american plutocracy , it 's still infinitely better than putin 's neofascism . 
  why fascism ? 
  why would i ever call russians by the name they call all the people they do n't like ? 
  well , recently i 've found this article called [ fourteen defining characteristics of fascism ] ( http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm ) ( the rest of the site seems more than a bit conspiratarded , but the points in the article are still valid ) . 
  guess how many does putin 's russia fit ? 
   ok after 1953 there was no more stalin . 
  get over it . 
  it seems that you would prefered hitler anyways . 
  you 're like those retards that say '' if germans would have won we would have all had bmws '' . 
  ( ... ) ever heard of bi-polar world , and cold war . 
  look it up . 
  ah , the good ol' [ if you 're not with me , then you 're my enemy !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vexpbrj.png ) russian propaganda divides people into those who love russia , and nazis . 
  where nazi means whoever the russian government does n't like . 
  thanks , i 'll pass . 
   do n't try to play the innocent virgin here . 
  whenever russia was weakened or attacked by a foreign power , poland always jumped on the band wagon . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93russian_war funny thing : in the vast majority of these conflicts , russia was either the aggressor , or the occupant . 
   please tell me who 's boots you , your parents or your grand-parents had to lick ? 
  personally , nobody 's . 
  that was the job of the puppet government . 
   because for the majority of russians times are worse and society is even more unequal and there seems to be no future . 
  translation : * shit 's all fucked up here , so we can fuck shit up for other people too , because reasons . 
  *  reading that i sometimes wish that nazi occupation had lasted 20-40 years so your ancestors would have fully tasted it and had something to compare with . 
  that reminds me of an old joke from the times of communism : a little girl approaches stalin and says : `` uncle stalin , please give me some candy ! '' . 
  and stalin replies : `` fuck off ! '' . 
  such mercy !, 
  he could have killed her !, 
   as long as you did n't bother the state by being a dissident , the authorities did n't care . 
  * commit no thoughtcrime , and we 'll let you live . 
  * see , that kind of thing kinda sucks . 
  right now i can go out into the streets and shout `` fuck the government !, 
  '' , and nobody in my family will lose their job , or get kicked out of school , and my body wo n't be found next week floating in a river . 
  and i like that . 
   there was economic developpement [ glorious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i2z9zne.jpg ) [ socialist ] ( http://i.imgur.com/igie5wb.jpg ) [ prosperity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ntnzsvqir8 ) , everyone !, 
   disrupted by western countries as always , it 's all fault of those pesky imperialist ` muricans !, 
  there 's a reason why rwpg , the polish abbreviation of the name for the [ council for mutual economic assistance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comecon ) was often jokingly translated as `` rosji wszystko , polsce g\u00f3wno '' ( `` russia gets all , poland fuck all '' ) . 
  in secrecy and silence , of course , because one never knew who might be listening in . 
   again the killings were targeted against political opponents . 
  sure . 
  read up on what happened to the members of the resistance movement ( ak ) after the soviet `` liberation '' . 
   but what happens when russia is n't pushing west ? 
  the west pushes east !, 
  yes , this is what russian leaders tell their people to justify their regular attempts ( too often successful ) at taking over eastern europe . 
  the problem is that in time , russia always fails . 
  you see , we [ kinda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bar_confederation ) [ do n't ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ko%c5%9bciuszko_uprising ) [ like ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_uprising ) [ getting ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising ) [ invaded ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) by various incarnations of the russian empire . 
  glorious russian empire has no need for dirty , stinking western math !, 
  the only thing even remotely surprising about this is that the turnout in the referendum was below 100 % . 
  they 're finally starting to grasp the basics of mathematics !, 
  that sounds suspiciously like `` see , the nazis would have killed you , we at least kept you alive on a leash and graciously let you lick our boots ! '', 
  if russians have suffered so much under the soviets , then why do they basically worship the good old times and want them to come back ? 
  the nazi occupation lasted 6 years , the soviet occupation ( because the people 's republic surely could n't be considered an independent country ) lasted 44 years . 
  also , stalin and the soviets killed more people than the nazis , only their crimes were n't as publicized . 
  they also did n't target any particular ethnic or religious group , they killed everyone they did n't like indiscriminately . 
   so , what do you think it will take to put the past behind us ? 
  russians need to stop acting like they have a divine right to rule over everything that 's to the east of germany and stop the rabid nationalism . 
  that , however , seems extremely unlikely to ever happen .
