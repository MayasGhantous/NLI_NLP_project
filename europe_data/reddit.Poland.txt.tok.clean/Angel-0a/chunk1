those built right after the war , like those on [ constitution square ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/0/10643/z10643590q,plac-konstytucji.jpg ) , are quite sturdy and not that ugly imo . 
  monumental and a little bit boring but i 've seen worse . 
  yoy 're probably thinking of [ prefabs ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/2014_k%c5%82odzko%2c_ul._sp%c3%b3%c5%82dzielcza_01.jpg ) that came later and were of low quality . 
  [ same place ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@52.233006,21.0196588,3a,75y,26.34h,97.22t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1stjdx8wd9xx7cagn5xpkzna!2e0 ) today on street view viewed from roughly the same spot the black sedan is parked on the picture . 
  you can see how it was rebuild . 
  [ go see for yourself ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@52.2321275,21.0203728,3a,75y,199.26h,91.55t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s4cgnbuzhrtisokixlunlza!2e0 ) . 
  looks like they got rid of these antennas since 2008 though ... 
   poland took steps to diversify supplies by raising import capacity from the european union and building a liquefied natural gas terminal . 
   `` the decision to start negotiations was made following significant changes that took place on the european energy market in recent years , '' the warsaw-based company said . 
  looks like pgnig hopes we diversified our options enough to make gazprom compete for our market . 
  i actually had polish diaspora in mind . 
  it is however possible indeed that this was orchestrated by polish government or polish embassy in vilnius . 
  i 'm not asking about the cemetery , i 'm asking about this particular enterprise of attaching ribbons and candles in poland 's national colors to every cross . 
  this took some serious effort . 
  i wonder if it was polish diaspora or local lithuanian government responsible for this . 
  as i said i never heard of something of such magnitude being done on wwii soviet graves in poland and if it was , it would probably sparked some controversy ( we 're very unforgiving nation ) . 
  do you know by any chance if this was polish or lithuanian initiative ? 
  if it 's you guys then it 's really touching . 
  we have a few cemeteries of fallen wwii soviet soldiers . 
  i know some people attend these graves too during all saints ' but i never heard of anything even close of what was done here . 
  at first i thought i can see a column of little green man advancing from kaliningrad into masuria region of poland . 
  they are just lakes though . 
  kinda inconsistent . 
  in uk the second language is polish , which obviously is caused by large number of polish immigrants , not by brits choosing polish as their second language . 
  in poland however the second language is english , which may only refer to english being the second language of choice to poles . 
  the second most popular language one could hear on a street in poland would probably be russian , ukrainian or vietnamese . 
  it 's also a little bit sad that belarusian is the second language in belarus . 
  no , i ca n't and i 'm not sure why you ask . 
  u/kgb _ for_everyone was referring to dissolution of soviet union in 1991 and so was i. 
  but you have wizz air . 
  should n't there be plenty of job opportunities for hungarian speaking technicians ? 
  well , according to this ad , the real fun is moving * through * lithuania . 
  preferably in a shipping container . 
  would n't appreciating russian people for resolving this situation in a civilized manner be offensive in a way ? 
  it would be like appreciating brits for not bombing the shit out of scots . 
  peaceful resolution of separatist ambitions is what is expected from civilized nations . 
  it was zdzis\u0142aw skrok i believe who compared then ukraine to poland 's caribbean . 
  it was a wast land , sparsely inhabited by natives , just waiting for it 's resources to be exploited . 
  and so we did . 
  a big colonization effort was undertaken to populate this land with settlers , mostly polish peasants from mazovia ( if i remember correctly ) . 
  to encourage them to relocate all settlers were granted unprecedented freedom for 10 or so years after settlement . 
  trouble began when their free time ended , as they did n't want to be serfs again . 
  ultimately they rebelled . 
  so in a way ukraine is poland 's rebelled colony ( * so fucking what ? 
  * - said the usa ) . 
  i do n't remember were i read it but there is this opinion that it was poland 's huge failure not to recognize ukrainian nation when it started forming . 
  crown 's only reaction to unrest in these lands was to drown ukraine in it 's own blood . 
  we could have recognized them as a third nation of the commonwealth and give them the same rights and privileges but `` big corpo '' wanted these lands and people for their wheat farming . 
  i guess you think of [ operation vistula ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_vistula ) as a source of animosity . 
  in my opinion it started way earlier and by the time of [ khmelnytsky uprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising ) our relations were already fucked up . 
  mostly by us . 
  i guess i have `` white man guilt '' . 
  yeah , surely it has nothing to do with a chance to have a friendly buffer state between us and russia and a big developing market integrated into eu just on our doorstep . 
  i do n't get it . 
  so were the usa or soviet russia empires or not ? 
  sounds like you consider only absolutist monarchies to be empires . 
  c'mon , we did it once , with all these slaves working on wheat farms and shit ... 
  in the polish corner : - [ jan iii sobieski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_iii_sobieski ) - `` lion of lechistan '' , the saviour of european christendom - [ j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_pi%c5%82sudski ) - miracle worker, 
  i wonder who 's the brit that lives in vatican city and what does he do there ? 
  what 's the story with saudi arabia ? 
  you 're like 3rd or 4th person in this thread that hates saudis . 
  did i miss something ? 
  i guess they still remember [ \u017beligowski 's mutiny ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbeligowski's_mutiny ) , which was basically poland 's crimean stunt in lithuania ... 
  well , you guys do some good work here for sure . 
  since i joined r/europe my feelings towards romania changed from `` no opinion '' to `` like '' ( although i visited romania once earlier - you have some pretty girls and smart shepherds ) . 
  ... then , depending on what year it is , it 's either one very lonely countryball or it 's poland fucking with france again . 
  legal does not mean accepted . 
  i guess the main reason for this was our nobles ( szlachta ) fixation on personal liberties . 
  they were opposed to every law that could have been used against them . 
  afaik polish religious tolerance can also be attributed to this . 
  it 's not like protestant religions were accepted with no objection , it was just that szlachta did n't want any new laws that would give the king any reason to prosecute one of theirs ... 
  how come croatia has different legalisation date than other post-yugoslav republics ? 
  google `` tomasz siemoniak warns france '' and you 'll find all the sources you like ( i do n't know if [ the economic times ] ( http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-09-29/news/54437346_1_missile-shield-poland-nato-allies ) is any good ) . 
  they are all referring to siemoniak 's interview with polish newspaper rzeczpospolita . 
  i guess that 's the idea - they would not and would try to buy gas somewhere else . 
  it 's still a free market after all . 
  the thing is that loosing this bet would mean loosing whole eu market at once . 
  and that 's a risk even russia could probably not afford . 
   everyone knows the us is the bringer of peace and freedom the key difference ( if you really need to stick to this narration ) is that the usa make you their bitch , while russia makes you their cattle . 
  bitches at least get paid well . 
   is n't , or was n't there sometime ago , a pet theory circulating that not unlike rurik , mieszko i could , perhaps , trace his lineage up north ? 
  this theory has been around for awhile , at least since early xix century . 
   wages here are too low to have children in ones 20 . 
  ( . . ) most of people ca n't afford it . 
  i wonder how accurate is this statement . 
  it so happens that two girls i work with are in their mid-20 's and already have children ( one has two boys , the other a girl ) . 
  while children for sure require some extra spending , it 's not like any of my friends has to eat grass because of that and i do know that their salary is medicore even by polish standards . 
  you have to provide your children with food , clothing and education but it 's not that expensive unless you have an ambition to make it so ... also it is usually poorer people that tend to have more children at earlier age . 
  for example the very first graph in this oecd research paper [ ( pdf ) ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/sf2.3%20mean%20age%20of%20mother%20at%20first%20childbirth%20-%20updated%20240212.pdf ) shows that the richer the country , the higher is age of women at the birth of the first child ( with uk , germany , switzerland and luxembourg in top 6 ) . 
  so it kinda contradicts an assumption that financial stability is a key factor when considering having a baby . 
  my guess is that financial stability leads to quite the opposite . 
  children close some options to you . 
  you 're basically stuck at home for a few years at least . 
  if you feel like traveling , getting a degree or using your `` willing to relocate '' ability to get a better job , then a child is a burden . 
  if you 're stuck in , say ... communist-era poland , and you feel your money is good for nothing anyways , you ca n't afford your own house , let alone to relocate or travel , then having a baby is a nice way to have something to do with your life once you get married . 
  yeah , but i hope he 'll be some general in one of these bases or sth ... ;-), 
  well , we did our best for you not to be troubled ... ;-) it may be of interest to you that there is a british chapter in this history . 
  when we were still loosing badly your lord curzon proposed a border between poland and soviet union based on ethnicity of peoples living in the area . 
  soon after we were winning and pushed bolsheviks back deep into their territory , so naturally we lost interest . 
  however , history tricked us 20 years later .
