   now they 've forgotten us and only play with hungary i was thinking the same , although we have a lot in common . 
  but hopefully something begins to improve in that matter . 
  what polish death kamps do you know then ? 
  the only responsible for holocaust are germans . 
   how we name something directly influences how we think about it . 
  like polish death camps, 
  omg , what a a load of nonsense , almost nothing there is true o.o what is this washington post . . ? 
  eastern europe is better europe again  . 
  naming does n't matter , what matter is that you did great thing with this fusion reactor , i must admit . 
   wendelstein 7-x ` stellarator ' at the beginning i was like `` omg , they build this total destruction weapon again ''  . 
  sorry germans , you know the rule , that if you take two random german words and add number to it , it always sounds like a weapon name , 
  [ russian aircraft carrier xd ] ( https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/avengers-helicarrier-640x353.jpg ), 
  this thread made me realize even more , how much you western europeans differ from us , eastern europeans . 
  i am very happy with my taxes being spent on church . 
  remember your words on france president election ... 
  i 'm afraid french will `` vote for change '' : /, 
   til possibly because you do n't attend masses in your local church . 
  try it . 
  opposition in poland is that witless , you do n't have to watch cabarets or comedys , 
  you like your imams speaches ? 
  i must sadden you - catholic priests stay away from incitements to violence . 
  or is it just another victim of the admiral kuznetsov ? 
  this must have happened when german generals found out that they lose their [ battle elephants ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iondcrfsdu4 ) because of imigrants . 
  omg our bitches won the game xd, 
  `` a longer-lasting federation was subsequently established via the creation of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth , an arrangement that lasted until the late-18th-century '' . 
  also try [ jagiellonian , polish-lithuanian dynasty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jagiellonian_dynasty ) ( just look at [ these maps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jagiellonian_dynasty#/media/file:jagiellonian.png ) ) or [ habsburgs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_habsburg ) who were the closest to realization of intermarium . 
  also i never wrote about someone being polish vassal , or about gravitating to poland . 
  poland is actually a american vassal ( just like ue is , although it tries to get out of this relation since about 2003 ) , so also whole ` intermarium ' is under american protection . 
  you did n't ask for any facts , but nevertheless i presented to you areas of joint activities : common projects , common culture & language , common protector , common defence purchases , even common history , and favorable geography ; carpathians are kind of problem , but there are some projects that may overcome it , like via carpathia , or polish spendings for inland north-south sailing ( 15 bln euro already alocated within next few years ) . 
  there are many projects like that being under construction - you can find details in the internet . 
  you just proved you have no idea what are writing about - you take some small pieces of international politics and make them a determinant of the whole strategy of the countries . 
  furthermore , i have n't heard about any polish crimes on belarusians , except few individual cases . 
  russians have hundreds of thousands of murders in belarus on their conscience , it is not big deal to remindem them of this . 
  also russia is getting under serious international pressure and its voice may be ommited . 
  intermarium is obviosul more than 600 years old - [ here you can read something about it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) . 
  maybe it was not called that name before , but polish , belarusian , ukrainian and balcan terriroies always gravitate towards each other . 
  it is geography that does it . 
  i just told you some areas where it is happening and you can obviosuly discuss the facts , but i 'm not interested in it . 
  geopolitical ideas may be dead for 500 years , and finally come up to live , because geography does n't change . 
  intermarium is a more than 600-years idea , it comes up every century , sometimes successfully . 
  80 years means nothing to it . 
  we start with north-south pipelines , gas transit paths , railways , highways and increased trade revenue . 
  but also with joint military effort , with quite similar culture and language , with some other common goals . 
  and it is happening now . 
  you sound quite ignorant , discounting the fact that even geographic factors push these countries towards each other . 
  obviously those countries are weak , alone they do n't have any possibility to unite , and both germans and kacaps would do a lot , to prevent it . 
  but now it is possibly in ` murica interest to integrate them . 
  and if yes , i hope we will use this . 
  it 's not about visegrad group anymore , we hope for [ intermarium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) with [ american help ] ( https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/06/17/pola-j17.html ) . 
  lets just add that england and france have finished receiving reparations from germany just few years ago , and belgium had free electricity until late 90s, 
  i think vox populi is the most important case here . 
   these ` pseudo-fans ' are damaging to poland 's image abroad oh realy ? 
  is it not alread destroyed by the constant repeating lies about polish concentration camps ? 
  or that poles started iiww ? 
  or that poles are anti-semitic ? 
   about three million polish jews were murdered in the holocaust during world war two also around 3 million poles were murdered by germans and russians , but who cares ... 
  answered above, 
   krs , main council of advocates , amnesty international krs is under these changes , so it is obvious they are not happy . 
  advocates council have been against pis since the elections ... amnesty international is trusted only by liberal-leftists fun fact - in almost none of these articles there are links to specific laws , but only emotional statements . 
  it 's just like i gave you [ this source ] ( https://wpolityce.pl/polityka/348611-projekt-ustawy-o-sadzie-najwyzszym-lamie-konstytucje-bzdura-wiekszosc-zmian-bezposrednio-z-niej-wynika ) where experts say that all changes are great and in line with the constitution . 
  or here is another article that says [ the changes are constitutional ] ( http://wolnosc24.pl/2017/07/17/gubisz-sie-w-tym-o-co-chodzi-w-reformie-sadow-ekspert-ordo-iuris-wyjasnia-wszystkie-szczegoly/ ) the constitution says that the court system is established by common bill . 
  when you change the court system , its president can be put into a state of rest . 
  in my opinion polish judiciary should be thoroughly changed , but i am subjective as i had a some adventures with polish courts . 
  the present reform proposal does not seem to be the happiest , it gives a lot of authority to the government , but most experts claim it is constitutional ( the constitution says that the court system is established by common bill ) . 
  after all i 'm happy we are having this discussion . 
  i am supporter of the judges being chosen in the public election . 
  pros : 38 % cons : 31 %, 
  that 's basically what historians do . 
  also do you know the word ` patriot ' ? 
  i know it 's a bit clich\u00e9d , but it fits . 
  this ` nuclear option ' is popular saying in recent world, 
  i have to bite myself 's tongue ( ... keybord ? ), 
  so often , i hardly feel it . 
  and it 's still not easy for me . . 
  exectly - this is how * real * power leans out of the corner and delivers its postulates, 
  do you think it was intended trolling ? 
  nope , it was francium , because it 's spectrum is white , just like [ french flag ] ( http://telecoms.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/01/white-flag.jpg ), 
  you mean this like some new claims for her ... vaterland ? 
  although they are almost always emotionless . 
  wow , this 47 % for poland is totally impossible , we have at least 70 % . 
  the poll was probably made in warsaw . 
  come get some, 
  i think it 's high time to show germans their place in the ranks . 
  they forgot their history . 
  i 'm doing a really high hopes about trumps visit in poland . 
  pretty odd as for me, 
  i 'm really happy with our current government , 
  i 'm just afraid of latvia at time of this cup , just like crimea happened during olimpics in kacapia, 
  i have to admit this is really fascinating for me , to try to subjugate poles and hungarians with penalties . 
  dutch , germans , swedes - ok , this may succeed . 
  but poles and hungarians ? 
  this can only trigger a salvo of laughter , and then , much more resistance . 
  and obviously this will cause a huge increase of euroscepticism . 
  as for me , after this - one of the most strategic for poland decision - eu project is dead . 
  i 'm going to sign up to pis party and do the best i can ... 
  goood . . do you think this will defend you , when russians come in ? 
  brexit sometimes really undermines my faith in democracy ... 
  as soon , as we make them to . 
  at that moment i thought of [ putins bodyguard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0iemaku.jpg ) ^ although ^ he 's ^ known ^ to ^ be ^ sweetheart, 
  do n't you worry , it 's just another ` success ' she makes in regard to brexit,
