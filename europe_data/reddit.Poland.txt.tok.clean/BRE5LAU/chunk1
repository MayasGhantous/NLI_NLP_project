r/evilbuildings material, 
  kindly go fuck yourself mate, 
  i 'm tired of this argument . 
  `` we 're giving you money , so shut up ! '', 
  so any criticism coming from us , whether it 's valid or invalid , is immediately dismissed with that retort . 
  it 's condescending , not a one-to-one relationship , and you really ca n't blame us for not being pleased about it . 
  the money is an investment anyway , not a bribe for us to go along with anything you say . 
  we 're very grateful for the money , but there are still issues with the eu that need to be addressed , and hiding behind money is no way to do that . 
  frankly , i find it disgusting . 
  i 'm a europhile , not an eu-phile . 
   my so your * what * ? 
  :d / s, 
  upvoted with the sole purpose of making americans salty, 
  yeah , let 's pretend to be offended on behalf of those nonsense-believing men :d, 
   he said : `` apple is a company that violated european consumers ' rights . 
  they refused to reimburse me . 
   `` i told them : ` give me my money back ' . 
  they said no . 
   ** `` so you know what is happening ? 
  this is happening ! `` he shouts , before swinging his steel ball down upon the screen of another iphone .

  in polish it 's the same but reversed , lol . 
  * dziwka * = slut , and * dziewka * is an old-fashioned word for a young woman . 
  and then we all die for good in switzerland , our final destination . 
  how the fuck was that cringy ? 
  it 's like the most misused word ever , i swear, 
  brought a tear to my eye, 
  no , we 're more catholic than the pope . 
  poland did exactly the same , shortly after 1989 . 
  communists seem to hate crowned birds .

  the problem lies in the fact that most people are stupid and easily influenced , not in the tabloids that capitalise on them . 
  if you want to address the real problem , you need to create an environment in which people are encouraged to be educated and independent , and you wo n't have that if you do n't let people think for themselves , i.e. 
  by allowing the government to decide what can or can not be said by private entities in the public square . 
  holy shit , i 'm dying, 
  i think the most unusual rule that comes to mind is that we always capitalize the second-person pronouns : `` you '' , `` yours '' , `` sir '' , `` ma'am '' , etc. , to show respect to the person we 're addressing . 
  the guy looks so much like rados\u0142aw sikorski , lol, 
  `` strzecha '' is * thatch * , which is what roofs used to be covered with in the past :d, 
  i feel like i could learn czeski in an afternoon , so easy :d  raz o nim s\u0142ysza\u0142em . 
  is it a zero-sum game ? 
  would everyone else get poorer if the shareholders made more money ? 
  if not , why should anyone be happy about this ? 
  ( all assuming that your claim is even true ), 
  that 's got ta be good news , seeing as san escobar is one of our greatest allies, 
  noo , that 's part of the [ `` recovered territories '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recovered_territories ) , you [ see ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/138/reece.jpg ), 
  i 'd say most of the poles who come here are left-leaning or centrist , you wo n't see much of that pis-talk here . 
  i think this could actually be a good thing , as it ensures that we 'll never get too complacent . 
  there 's always room for improvement . 
  but yeah , it could be a bit more balanced . 
  this right here is precisely why ukrainians are able to integrate so easily in poland, 
  \\  tfw astrophysics student should 've gone for coal minings like my dad told me to ; _ ;, 
  free software devs are the best, 
  explanation for non-poles : it 's from `` wina tuska '' , meaning `` tusk 's fault '' , which is basically our version of `` thanks obama '' . 
  it also means [ `` tusk 's wines '' ] ( http://demotywatory.pl//uploads/201305/1368016287_qajrus_600.jpg ) , which makes it especially memeable, 
  off the top of my head : painkiller , dying light , dead island , this war of mine , bulletstorm , shadow warrior 2 , cyberpunk 2077 ( * when it 's ready * ), 
  ah yes , we love fighting our government so much we literally went ahead and elected a bunch of utter fuckwits just to have the opportunity . 
  it ended up being a bit more than we bargained for , but at least we 'll be busy fighting for the next couple of years . 
  absolute madmen we are, 
  i despise jaros\u0142aw `` jebany karakan '' kaczy\u0144ski as much as the next guy , but you should n't wish that on anyone mate, 
  i 'm from wroc\u0142aw and my parents did that when i was little . 
  i remember there was a carp in our bathtub once, 
  i 'm polish and i see nothing wrong with that picture, 
  integrating flawlessly , 
  makes me think of that eddie izzard stand-up . 
  * well done indeed !, 
  i guess being butthurt 24/7 must take its toll ; we just ca n't help it, 
  wtf i thought we were the racists, 
  i lived near ostr\u00f3w tumski and , man , so many of my childhood memories are attached to that place . 
  we ran around those parts a lot and probably annoyed the restaurant staff quite a bit , and the german tourists . 
  and the [ lamplighter :d ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gj36g2v.jpg ) . 
  every time i come back there it 's like a spiritual experience for me . 
  our prince-polo brothers, 
  good luck trying to make that statement work in poland , whose entire history has been a struggle for independence , and whose people have only been enjoying their freedom for a quarter of century . 
  go tell them it 's not about the polish people and that you know better them about how they should run their country . 
  two countries leaving the eu at roughly the same time surely would n't inspire people with confidence about the whole project . 
  i 've never heard of polish skinheads making any references to slavic culture and mythology , i thought they were all nationalists and catholics . 
  when they go out on the streets , all you hear is `` god , honor , homeland ! '', 
  chants and stuff like that . 
  they 're also strongly anti-communist , and the idea of slavic identity is often connected with old soviet propaganda in here , so it does n't make much sense to me . 
  edgy, 
  one of my favorite humans alive tbh * ( roughly speaking ) * i 've never heard him use the term ' * cultural * marxism ' though, 
  not all change is good change . 
  eastern europeans know that very well, 
  yeah , i 'm 24 and i 've only seen a muslim person 2 or 3 times in my life here, 
  i love the one on the right , looks like it 's about to take off t-10 seconds , all systems nominal, 
  i like the ordnung, 
  it was n't very effective though , was it, 
  that 's why i like it . 
  it looks different from what you normally see in europe . 
  a bit of variety never hurts . 
  ( unless you consider us a bad influence ; personally , i really like skyscrapers . ), 
  and switched to vkontakte to keep in touch with his [ fam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_sisters_\\ ( moscow \\ ) ) :d, 
  yes , so what ? 
  european butthurt lol, 
  future is looking good for polan next we win world cup in russia ( lewy 9 goals in 5 minutes vs brazil , screencap this ) and go into space and steal jobs on mars,

  no need to apologize , it 's normal to have local names for places ; we also use names like pary\u017c , londyn , kij\u00f3w , wilno nasze , nowy jork , monachium , etc. 
  i do . 
  that 's a strange way of using it , to be honest . 
  thanks for your concern though , with the wikipedia link and all , did n't seem patronizing at all :d,
