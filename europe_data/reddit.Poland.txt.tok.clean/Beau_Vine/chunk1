rational or not , poland meets the 2 % benchmark , but lithuania does not . 
  together with the fact that trump still denies russia has invaded georgia or ukraine , that 's a lot more encouragement to putin and surkov than i feel comfortable with , regardless of my country actually meeting this goal . 
  `` not all '' only 5 nato members spend the 2 % he was talking about . 
  pretty good ? 
  who ? 
  uk , us , greece , poland and estonia are the only ones who spend 2 % gdp on defence , and trump already made comments that he 'd not come to immediate help to those who do not spend this agreed upon amount . 
  i 'm lookimg at you , lithuania . 
  trump said he 'd not rush to defend countries that are not spending the guideline 2,5 % gdp on defence . 
  even if he bluffed : playing chicken with putin seems a dubious idea , he still claims russia is not and was not involved in ukraine . 
  looking at you , lithuania . 
  the mormon factor . 
  if evan mcmullin was chosen president it 'd be a glorious finalle . 
  also , poland should be marked `` changing '' . 
  sadly , this i know from experience . 
  even within context of my hobby , with russians who visit being top level contestants , there 's hesitance to try and even make contact at best . 
  it was n't as bad with exchange students . 
  but when there 's nothing forcing mingling , it must feel awful , because people are very unlikely to reach out . 
  if you visit during summer , hit up historical reenactment events . 
  worst comes to worst , you 'll at least see a compatriot or two mop up competition , providing some stress release , 
  perhaps . 
  for other examples i was drawing from my experiences in my job and hometown . 
  the only two russians i know are very specific cases . 
  that said , in a specific enough case , you can be ex-spetznaz and be considered family . 
  i would n't vouch this would be similar in a different job and living setup though . 
  this might be an oversimplification . 
  after an education reform when we were accesing eu , we have essentionally stopped educating new tradesmen . 
  ring a bell ? 
  manual labour = / = unskilled labour . 
  on a daily basis , i visit businesses most of which would like to produce more , to invest into new workplaces : but there 's no people with relevant training . 
  we need doctors , seamstresses , tailors , welders , electricians etc. 
  ukrainians come here to work 10 h shifts , some saturdays , and save enough to go back home . 
  and when they stay , even when they stay in touch with their roots , they 're pretty hard to distinguish from someone from podlasie . 
  you 'll be _ pretty _ sure , but not certain . 
  it 's a complicated issue . 
  but `` ciapaty '' seems to be the key derogatory term here . 
  i shit you not , in a city near me it 's a bulgarian minority that 's under increased scrutiny . 
  they speak polish , most intermarried with poles , they 're selling cheap clothes . 
  half of the city shittalks them behind their back while wearing their clothes -_- the shit you hear as a courier , man . 
  well , you just solved how to get balkan slavs into the mix . 
  so we text all our compatriots , and hold referendums monday ? 
  no , from the same university they studied at . 
  i 'm ok with that , actually . 
  say _ one _ thing in polish , watch as people flock to you to try and teach you more . 
  it 's a knee-jerk reaction to us . 
  integration is a biggie for most poles . 
  you can , and maybe even should , be proud of your heritage , but if you go out of your way to hang out with some poles , and learn the language - people go nuts . 
  bonus points for keeping a different accent . 
  it _ can _ be a much different story for people of different skin colour though . 
  in my area in lieu of middle-easterners ( because pretending they 're all syrian seems disingenuous , [ as they 're not even half of the migrants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis ) ) , people have been shitty towards ... bulgarians . 
  but 2-3 weeks ago i came across a syrian getting a job where he 'll be trained in industry that 's currently starving for workers . 
  for better or worse , the situation here is much different and complicated than what you can learn off of media . 
  as for immigration of other slavs - our most beloved king was a lithuanian . 
  our golden age was during the commonwealth . 
  when you look at our national epic , or history books - [ even though the war was against ottoman empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93cossack%e2%80%93tatar_war_ ( 1666 % e2 % 80 % 9371 ) ) , most focus is on ukrainian cossacs , whom commonwealth gave too little freedom , and too late . 
  i do n't know what the best analogy would be , maybe nordic states . 
  poles value [ sald bowl cultural integration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salad_bowl_ ( cultural_idea \\ ) ) over melting pot . 
  hang out with us , learn the language , and you 'll get even more respect for honouring your heritage . 
  since most slavs can understand eachother by just speaking a bit more slowly , this means that ukrainians or czechs in poland meet our criteria for what being `` integrated '' means almost immediately . 
  come and see for yourself . 
  polish universities are underfunded , which means it 's almost only viable to make a doctorate at your alma mater , which promotes politikers and stifles growth . 
  this is made worse because prominent professors tend to also be active members of political parties ( one of my profs was even a leader of one ) . 
  i dislike current gov , and doubt their sincerity , but if there 's a ban on making a phd at your alma mater and it 's paired with a liveable stipend ( which is a fucking joke as far as costs go when compared to their social give-aways ) , it could jump start our science . 
  already there 's a stark contrast wherever our academics work in tandem with scientists from other countries - ie with germans in archaeology . 
  they 've promised to try and fix that , we 'll see . 
  there 's also field - specific issues . 
  ie in archaeology , the scientist who leads a dig , can then stop other scientists from accessing data because they get indefinite `` dibs '' on writing a paper on that . 
  they can sometimes sit on findings for decades . 
  it 'd be great if there was ie a 3-5 year limit on that , but i have n't heard a pip on trying to fix this . 
  currently it 's circumvented by cooperating with ie germans and papers from such co-ops are always published in timely matter , and with much superior german funding for analytics . 
  of ukrainians ? 
  ca n't get enough of them . 
  they have tradesmen we desperately need , their language and culture is similar , and we just get along well . 
  i feel immigration in general and immigration of other slavs are two very different subject for poles . 
  [ our by far favourite king was a lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_ii_jagie%c5%82%c5%82o ) , so i 'm all for that . 
  now we need to figure out how to bring croatia into the mix :d, 
  ** language/exchange ** : similar as with czech or croatian - we can just talk in our native tongues and understand most of what each are saying . 
  another thing is that an ukrainian speaking with a heavy accent still sounds very similar to a pole from easternmost areas of poland . 
  now , when it comes to slavic languages , we have very different mannerisms . 
  ie polish sounds brutish and medieval to czechs , and czech sounds funny to us , while croatian sounds like they went out of their way to make some key phrases sound awesome . 
  ukrainian , sounds ... endearing i guess :d like canadian-english to other anglosaxons maybe ( riffing off of this analogy , croatian would be australian english ) . 
  ** academic/culture ** : the only hard part is that we use different alphabet , and that considerably complicates reading academic papers . 
  normally , key terms hail from the same name from latin , german , english ( depends on field ) , so with help of translated abstract you can quickly screen an article if it 's worth translating in full or not . 
  you can do that with language you have 0 understanding of . 
  not the case with different alphabet . 
  almost every polish university has very strong historical ties to ukraine . 
  because nazis and soviets focused on killing off most of our intellectual elites , when you read about history of almost any uni in poland it starts with some professors from lviv moving here to start a small but thriving faculty . 
  ** exchange/tourism : ** prices in ukraine are much lower than in poland , which makes it popular destination for backpackers , although i 've heard they get similar bad rep as most westerners in ie india ( condescending and smelly :p ) . 
  [ kie\u0142basa wyborcza ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pork_barrel )  barely 1 year in , noice . 
  well , every member state has to consider every move from pov of their own interests , and people in every state will have differing opinions . 
  they want security , i 'm glad they 're going to get it . 
  we need to pull ranks and stop this appeasement shit . 
  those `` rumors '' are rooted in what surkov and pomerantsev wrote about what russia intends to do , and how it intends to do it . 
  just googling their names will yield enough articles about it , and if you can read russian , surkov in past described these machinations himself . 
  http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/hidden-author-putinism-russia-vladislav-surkov/382489/ http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putins-rasputin https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/richard-sakwa/surkov-dark-prince-of-kremlin the guy wrote fucking books on the subject , and people are like `` but where are these unfounded rumours coming from ? '', 
  i can not wait . 
  uk and australia have the best smacktalking in politics , i ' l even take it over sea politicians nerd-slapping eachother . 
  even the layout of house of commons aids that . 
  one guy puts an elbow on the podium and unleashes the scorn right into the faces of opposition while his buddies cheer him , and his targets buddies boo - but somehow quiet enough not to interrupt the rant . 
  next week will bring a lot of much needed schadenfreude . 
  i was already looking forward to the_meltdown , but now this !,
