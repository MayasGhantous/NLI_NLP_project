  i 'll be able to ignore my own politicians until like thursday !, 
  not present day , but weapons , clothing , buildings , and many more small details are very close to historical artifacts from xiv/xv century . 
  the exceptions are characters and organizations that are magical or non human . 
  as far as novigrad goes , i bet some dutch/german peeps here could point out an ex-hanzeatic city with old town very similar to in-game novigrad , only with cars and modern clothes . 
  so you 're not that far off . 
  after 10 years of work in uk you 're looking at a guaranteed pension higher than after 45 years of work in poland , and you can move out to spain or croatia to live out your life there . 
  this is how i look at this : as citizens , we elect governments , to represent our collective interests . 
  an organization like that has means and clout to ie enforce a rule we should not stab others unless we have a really good reason to . 
  or to fight off other governments who decided taking our shit is in their best interest . 
  that 's why i have a really big issue with willingly giving up power to legislate and enforce the law to corporations , and that 's how i see the part of the agreement where corporations can sue governments . 
  that . 
  south america , africa , certain parts of sea - when a corporation has upper hand over government , it rarely works out for people in those areas . 
  a corporation has certain goals that are just non-compatible with society as a whole . 
  if you only get one shot at visiting europe , a great choice is croatia . 
  from rocky beaches with crabs , to mountains to climb and hike at in about 1 h drive . 
  if you like driving - rent a car , it 'll be a treat in itself . 
  but yeah - that 's one of the best perks of working as a long distance driver , or otherwise on delegation . 
  i can sometimes visit 2-3 castles in a day , and once i reset my mind to how close everything actually is here , it got much more obvious . 
  americans believe 100 years is a long time , europeans believe a 100 km is a long distance . 
  trains are just banal to use now that you can use your self phone , and even in countries outside of euro zone - you can usually pay in euro at least in bigger businesses in major cities . 
  in turn , our national parks have nothing on teddy roosevelt pet project . 
  what we have , we 're slowly but steadily removing in name of crucial infrastructure adjustments . 
  i 'd love to visit the wild parts of us . 
  maybe colorado , since they found a way to make hiking even more attractive , 
  and yet , the official response is that this ex minister has never used e-mail . 
  it 's like they 're using an 8-ball for excuses . 
  surkov the post procesualist ? 
  could n't have happened to a nicer man . 
  http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/hidden-author-putinism-russia-vladislav-surkov/382489/ regardless if you believe or not , that russia stands behind rise of certain right-wing parties , read about surkov . 
  his actions and articles are why such idea of widespread manipulation is considered at all . 
  the list of nato countries spending the agreed on 2 % of gdp was a bit surprising tbh . 
  us , greece , poland , estonia and uk . 
  that 's cause you yanks forget about other nazi symphatizers . 
  http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/camp/eur/ea/ost/ans-react.html  there was widespread support for anschluss among the austrian people . 
  [ davidson , p. 
  [ joyous celebrations welcoming the german soldiers who crossed the border occurred througout austria ( march 11 ) ] ( http://histclo.com/imagef/date/2009/11/ans38-03s.jpg ) . 
  there is no doubt looking at the images that austrians wanted to be part of the new german reich . 
  we see cheering grounds that assembled on their own volition . 
  there was cheering and bands playing . 
  photographiv images clealy show a jubilent approval of the anschluss . 
  these were not manufactured crowds . 
  and the look on the faces of the people in the crods leave no doubt as to how the vienese and ither austrians felt . 
  bieber might be working de facto on us/na market , but that does n't mean canadians get a slide on that one . 
  or nickelback . 
  they probably think it 'd be much harder than it is . 
  i imported electronics before , and the paperwork proved to be a breeze . 
  i got mail that customs are processing my package and that i need to send them technical description and proof of purchase in polish ( english versions were in the package ) . 
  i launched chrome , let it translate pages , and printed out to pdf product description from the site i was buying it from , did the same with pay pal transaction details . 
  sent it to customs , and as soon as hey got that they sent me my package . 
  they did all the paperwork off of original documents , just needed the translations for red tape . 
  no hassle , very low fees . 
  next time went even smoother . 
  a localized version sold at a retailer who imported a copy - i get that . 
  a digital english version though ? 
  uh-huh . 
  except like i 've shown above , the difference is 40 , not 20 % . 
  # 154 * 1.2 = ** # 184,8 ** the price in uk for same year ( the article is from 2013 ) was ** # 211 ** , so there 's almost 20 % price hike ** after adjusting for vat ** . 
  not sure where they cocked up the phrasing , but numbers they put forward show a 40 % difference . 
   the exact place of birth is not a valid way to claim nationality . 
  poles and filipinos gasped reading this ;-)  this is ridiculous . 
  it made us think about various famous people . 
  and some dramatic changes on our maps . 
  ( i still ca n't get over kant for russia :d ), 
  greatest training of english i 've had was working a graveyard ( and therefore breakfast ) shift at a hotel reception . 
  every morning , as i was after whole nighter , they 'd zoom past me leaving for work in a hurry , barking out requests , jokes , etc - each in different regional accent . 
  frustrating at the time , but it was great exercise . 
  that is still such a dick fucking move . 
  they 've been overcharging uk for their products for ducking decades . 
  https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-fails-to-explain-uk-us-price-difference-for-xbox-one/ https://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/news/us-vs-uk-tech-prices-compared-spotify-photoshop-netflix/ now , i enjoy schadenfraunde over conscious if impulsive democratic choices like the next guy , but this is [ microsoft showing up uninvited and showing everyone middle finger ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xuo1sict147frg/giphy.gif ) . 
  '' * yeah ,  burp < remem-remember how i was overcharging you for our products ? 
  well guess what !, 
  well , they took a simple model of existing countries , some countries had vastly different territories , and different ethnic makeup . 
  kant gave me the biggest pause , at least asia minora is still culturally very different from mainland turkey . 
  as current top post states it `` great map if you want to maximalize the number of countries triggered !, 
  i was wondering though , who for turkey ? 
  all due respect to ataturk , that 'd put his general recognizability with the nordic picks . 
  but hey !, 
  at least they did n't go with helen ~ ~ of sparta ~ ~ , just helen ;-), 
  and for some reason think we can read cyrillic when the written phrase is in context of them being upset with how the match is going . 
  i guess at least they do n't make the pretence it matters to the ranting person what people listening to the rant will think . 
  it 's cathartic , but no matter how bad what they write out is , all you can see is `` that dude has had it with this match '' . 
  huh . 
  i think i 'll be more appreciative of team mates ranting in an alphabet i ca n't read . 
  the beatings and murders and tone used by media can make that impression though . 
  this is wishful thinking for the french . 
  paris is n't the only capitol who wants to swipe london bankig status , so other countries will argie for practicality sake . 
  if any , the new official language would be german , lord help us . 
  give me a tailor and i 'll find them a job . 
  attacking , [ harassing and murdering poles ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-37270519 ) does n't help since besides ukraine , that 's where tailors and seamstresses are brought from to other countries . 
  working in textiles , everyone worked up an apetite for brexit . 
  when uk actually does exit , the end terms might not be so bad for textiles in uk . 
  but the ambiguity now is great for everyone who wants a piece of that pie . 
  come to continent !, 
  ukrainian tailors are coming en masse to work here , for now mostly to poland , but they usually want to come back home , so ukrainian wormers usually insist there 's work on saturdays and some overtime . 
  i can hook you up with fusibles . 
  added bonus - you can blackmail me with knowlwdge of my reddit username  seriously though - textiles are one of the niches in which esp germans really want uk to have it harder . 
  netherlands and poland are great places to move to , dependimg on your profile . 
  germany as well , assuming you can break through - they 're likely to favour german companies over any other . 
  i brainfarted there hard . 
  orange revolution was peaceful .
