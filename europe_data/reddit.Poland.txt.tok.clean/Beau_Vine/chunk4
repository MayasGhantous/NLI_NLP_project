  she got a talking point to babble while the real ruler of our country , kaczy\u0144ski is in uk , meeting with theresa may . 
  arguably , the reason why pis did n't want him was the same as why others did . 
  because he 's a reminder that there is a difference between poland and current polish government ( ofc according to pis and it 's supporters , anyone against kaczy\u0144ski is therefore an anti-polish traitor ) . 
  i saw psl steal from public companies ( strefa ekonomiczna ) , put over a dozen cronies in it , replace its ceo with two people connected to psl . 
  pis came and replaced psl with pis cronies . 
  so pardon me for being sceptical of pis doing something because others were ** stealing ** . 
  their only problem is that ** others ** were stealing , 
  it was a rather brilliant business model , actually . 
  their main scheme was telecom extortion . 
  they paid lowlifes with so much debt they 'd never repay it anyway to sign contracts for 2y plans with a phone ( samsung flagmodels mostly ) for about $ 15 ( 50 z\u0142 ) . 
  but they needed the lowlifes , and they needed them to stay put . 
  so they offered a place to drink cheap wine , do heroin and leave a kid if need be . 
  in return they had a steady supply of lowlifes to sign contracts for phones , used cars etc. 
  in good weather they 'd take a few of cute and small ones on begging stints , and the rest played around . 
  unsurprisingly some of the kids were destructive - personally i 'm surprised so few of them were , given where they grew up . 
  maybe they kept in mind that many of them would end up in orphanage a few streets away once they turned school-age . 
  yeah - oddly enough that experience made me more open to any gypsies i meet - if they got out of that vicious cycle they deserve more respect than someone for whom education and stability is par for course . 
  and if they were not a part of it , they 're probably more upset with the bad apples than i am . 
  except other european countries ( ireland , norway , france , germany ) have introduced similar handouts , and it did n't affect rate of births whatsoever . 
  and they know this . 
  so i 'm rather in favour of it being kie\u0142basa wyborcza . 
  but it all circles back to the comment you replied to : this is a result of bad parenting , and we should blame parents rather than kids . 
  certainly not just boys being boys . 
  gypsies . 
  they tend to live in close-knit groups based on family/clan . 
  when i worked a rough beat as a courier , i had 2 clans in my area . 
  one was very hard working , great natured people that occasionally tried their hand in smaller schemes ( only a few of the younger ones ) . 
  the other operated a telecom extortion scheme out of a crack den/daycare and worked begging beats . 
  the matriarchs would take cuter kids to beg , the rest and older ones stayed at the crack den . 
  anywhere between 6-14 kids there , with drunks and narcos depending on weather . 
  and when i visited croatia , i learned that my gypsies were still creme de la creme compared to some clans from zagreb area . 
  i ca n't wait to see how mirga clan profiliates now with our gov giving 500 z\u0142 per month for a kid . 
  they already treated the kids as cattle/prop . 
  following the rationale i mentioned :  what does the ** uk goverment ** gain from this ? 
  for one , the press has been used as an early negotiating tool by both uk and eu . 
  current pis government whos leader just threw a fit over reelecting tusk is very symphayetic to may administration , and brexiters in general . 
  then , you have similar5 relations between uk and turkey vs eu . 
  with a headline like this , they 're killing two birds with one stone as far as preparation for triggering art 50 goes . 
  not to mention the anti-brown dogwhistle which may be incidental ( but i doubt it is - spinning `` there 's no racism here '' into `` silly sand-naggers '' is too much on the nose to be an accident in an outlet like bbc ) . 
  tl : dr divide and conquer . 
  bbc has always been hyper partisan , but quality . 
  they 're like al jazeera - as long as you remember who handles their leash , they 're a great source for pov of uk government . 
  but they do tend to twist meanings , feign ignorance , and cherry pick topics . 
  keep it in mind , do n't expect objectivity - and they 're still a superb journalism organization . 
  because peacekeeping missions call for more of a police-type approach and is best done with local ( ish ) forces . 
  ethiophia tops the chart with over 8k troops , then india etc - other countries provide instructors , specialists etc if there 's a shortage , but long term every region should be able to handle their own shit . 
  especially important in africa where dictators were able to spin un peacekeeping as an imperialist intervention . 
  how is auschwitz not symol of o\u015bwi\u0119cim ? 
  hordes of tourists visit it on their route to the castle ? 
  and while we 're at a subject of castles - should we demolish remaining teutonic castles as well ? 
  starting with malbork , presumably . 
  ca n't have anything infringe on prawilna safe space , reminding us of any parts of hiatory we do n't like . 
  pictures of the flame or it did n't even end with a burning flag . 
  the video shows two failed attempts . 
  at this point i 'm just rooting for these poor idiots . 
  it seems they somehow bought themselves a flame-retardant french flag for a dutch flag burning . 
  come on you guys . 
  or is this [ ~ ~ italian ~ ~ turk strike ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/work-to-rule ), 
   why do you have a front row to see the crooks , do you have job in a government owned business ? 
  a family member is a long time employee in a nationally owned company in a tax-free zone of investment . 
  for 25 years it worked under an apolitical ceo . 
  he got sacked , cited reason was too high operational costs ( even though he had results to show for it - it was one of top 3 such zones in the country ) . 
  he got replaced by 2 ceo 's instead , then over a dozen administrative got hired - interestingly enough all either members or close family of high ranking psl members , coincidence i 'm sure . 
  entire original crew resigned , initially . 
  media kept it under wraps - one of tv stations decided that reporting that a house representative has worn the same outfit twice to a hearing commission was more important to report on than an entire crew of a treasury-owned company handing in resignations basically putting their livelihoods as collateral to report corruption . 
  fast forward a few years , psl got voted out , and an odd thing happened . 
  they run on platform of being angry `` someone else ** steals !, 
  ** '' , but in reality they 're angry ** someone else ** steals . 
  next parlimentary elections are in 3 years , a little over a year to regional elections . 
  and it 'll be an exercise of `` whos stealing i know less about '' . 
  pis got a house majority by gaining 18,5 % of elegible voters to support them . 
  their continuous support is not due to what they do , but because many see them as the only viable alternative to crooks that came before them . 
  me , i 've got the same front row seats to see their thieving as i had for thieving of psl and to a degree of po . 
  that 's their mo. 
  only consider what the hard core supporters care for ( carefully curated by lies on radio maryja , director of which has been already given tens of millions just in 2016 ) , and bet that many people are fed up with alternatives , and only their supporters will vote en masse . 
  which is a solid fucking bet . 
  sld is basically a post communist mafia . 
  psl - same story , they curate 7 % support that makes them valuable to form parlimentary majority with whoever wins - they have almost no political agenda of their own , the cost of their support is seats in national companies . 
  po enabled psl thieving and did a fair share of their own , including straight up stealing pensions . 
  nowoczesna is just a political raft for po ditching the disgraced franchise . 
  kukiz 15 has brought in some pretty impressive people , ie tyszka . 
  but they 're a political circus , without coherent direction . 
  there is no sensible alternative to pis , and no time to build it . 
  and ffs , german and belgian politicians should stop `` helping '' asap . 
  it 's mildly appreciated by most , but is like a pre-built strawman for years of propaganda of pis/radio maryja for their core voters . 
  like an educated hindu phd deconstructing in thick indian accent what is wrong with trump policies - most will see a well spoken man detached from local life , trumpets will see a sand nigger trying to confuse them with fancy words . 
  funny you mentioned the victimhood thing . 
  that is literally taught in our schools . 
  with pis currently rewriting textbooks , it 'll get waaaay worse before it gets any better . 
  that 's my biggest beef with intertubes conversations - we use shorthand communicates that base on ours pov and experience , and everyone else fills the blanks in a different way . 
  here 's how i filled them , based on conversations with my right leaning friends - a journal * editor , an investment consultant and a mining engineer - so imho smart people . 
  a point they often raise is german neocolonialism . 
  polish companies making products `` made in germany '' , when from design through rnd to production and packing - everything is done by a polish company . 
  what they do n't take into account here , is that companies working for those lousy germans have now hands full of work , while those focusing on domestic market struggle . 
  then , take energy . 
  anti-german sentiment - big bad germany wants to suppress our coal industry to make a buck on photovoltaic and battery technology . 
  even though german coal plants will be last to close - they just intend to import chinese coal . 
  but another way to look at it is that poles paid fines for exceeding co2 emissions , germans put that money into developing photovoltaic and wind energy . 
  pis again axed in 2016 program to buy back green energy from households - which would have incentivized households to invest in green energy , because costs would halve ( most is cost of batteries and controllers for storing energy when we 're at work and do n't need the energy - but industry does ) .
