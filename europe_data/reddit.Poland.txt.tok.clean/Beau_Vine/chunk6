  foundation of geopolitics , a freely available russian textbook . 
  fucking read it already . 
  and maybe look up conflict in donbas - russia slowly inches towards nato , redeploys nuclear missiles to kalinigrad and belarus , but every time a small contingent is deployed to one of nato countries _ explicitly after they ask for it _ , the farthest the country is for us , the more there is of talk like this . 
  we are not russias sphere of influence . 
  we do not want to be . 
  we commited to allia ce with you people time and time again . 
  and you only think of us as temporarily-not-russia . 
  the kind that makes trump envious . 
  [ is big secret . 
  do n't tell / r/polandball plz , the memes are crucial part of our image building ] ( http://poland.pl/science/achievements-science/polish-technology-outer-space/ ) now that ruskie conspired with that sonnva birch to take down [ the calmer moon thief twin . 
  ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0060771/ ) placek has no chill . 
  does gda\u0144sk earn poland a spot ? 
  or like most of western medie summarizes entire countries with thousands of years of history : russias backyard '' . 
  pisses me off every time . 
  worse than that - entire witcher franchise focuses on racism , nationalism and racial genocide . 
  not even in a subtle way , with terms like `` pogrom '' . 
  and the `` world '' of the witcher is fucking tiny !, 
  it 's several small countries surrounded by mountains from north and east , and nilfgaard from south . 
  it 's the size of half of europe tops . 
  fuck over allies , get alienated . 
  ie - how eager neighboyrs are to deal with russia . 
  they do , all soldiers that fail to fulfill height requirements are put on half pay . 
  think of the methane emissions though !, 
  read foundations of geopolitics - trump is helping fulfill wishlist from this 20 yo textbook on russian geopolitics . 
  this is a must read for 2016/2017 and forward . 
  you guys give us the guardian and independant . 
  but it feels like the rest of your industry furiously wants to balance legitimacy of your press to some more acceptable breitbartian level . 
  all in all i chalk it up as a net benefit . 
  you got ta take the good with the bad . 
  although the level of `` bad '' in uk press is as astounding as level of `` good '' . 
  it 's pretty infuriating at times , especially when you live in a coal or ex-coal mining city . 
  coal transports give off more radiation than nuclear fuel transports , [ and coal power plants gove off more radiation than nuclear plants . 
  ] ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/ ) a typical coal mine in poland also claims 10-20 lives a year , that 's not counting earlier deaths from ie pulmonological issues , and diabetes vaused by steroids for said pulmonological issues ( both grandfathers were coal miners ) . 
  abandoned coal mines also have high background radiation on top of funsies like fucking up local hydrology , causing buildings and roads to break apart . 
  reminds me of how residents of districts of my town infamous for burning trash in their furnaces were protesting mobruk , a company recycling used tires into diesel after their prisms were set on fire . 
  yeah , it was a legit toxic threat when it happened . 
  still less stench and smog than a typical winter week in their area , and at least it was a one-off non premedidated accident . 
  the reason you include the bone is because marrow is the first to go bad and stink up , so it 's like a proof of freshness . 
  compare quality of meat in poland vs germany and then talk shit . 
  and a pork chop in egg batter is hardly a dish one has to invent or steal . 
  you know what else can be used as an offensive force ? 
  an openly offensive force ie nuclear missiles deployed in kalinigrad and belarus . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/russia-confirms-deployment-of-nuclear-capable-missiles-to-kaliningrad http://www.eurasianet.org/node/78976, 
  uh-huh . 
  except russians have been deploying offensive nuclear missiles in kalinigrad and belarus . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/russia-confirms-deployment-of-nuclear-capable-missiles-to-kaliningrad http://www.eurasianet.org/node/78976, 
  poland , estonia and from 2017 lithuania ( and iirc romania ? 
  no source on ro ) are the only nato countries besides greece uk and usa to fulfill the 2,5 % gdp defensive spending treshold . 
  so we 're aren ' y exactly sitting on our hands . 
  even before crimean uncursion poland had scheduled ry\u015b-16 maneuvers , where the scenario was that country a invades country b using soldiers planted as local minority insurgents . 
  russians were expected to use and reuse that card , and are n't exactly shy about it . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-russia-border-do-not-end-anywhere-comments-quote-eu-us-tensions-a7438686.html also , i wonder why no article mentions that russia has been stationing bigger groups of military and nuclear missiles much closer to polish borders ? 
  americans are to be stationed in silesia , literally as far from belarus and small russian enclave as possible .

  dude . 
  they not only elected trump , but continue to support him . 
  days of assuming something is too dumb to be a genuine response are over . 
  probably municipality - they do a lot of pr stuff like that . 
  ie theybpay restaurants and pubs to be open much longer than in most cities ( krak\u00f3w , warsaw , pozna\u0144 ) . 
  we do n't even `` take their women '' because every slavic nation is convinced theirs is the one with most beautiful women , 
  it means / b/tards are now officially recognized and politically important demographic . 
  that 's racist !, 
  and also very true . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberland http://www.thejournal.ie/polish-tourists-enclava-invented-country-new-slovenia-croatia-2105263-may2015/, 
  we 're too chill for that shit anyhow . 
  in hindsight , as much as i dislike beck , we should 've went ahead [ with madagascar plan ... ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonization_attempts_by_poland ), 
  i travel around poland only spending 2-3 days at home . 
  have n't been to e\u0142k this year though , so as you 've said , the shock might be well ahead of me , 
  i came to gda\u0144sk from lower silesia , and first year or two were a constant cultural shock for me in that regard . 
  first time i 've met genuine catholics , too ( barring a single family in my hometown ) . 
  that said , it was also the first time i 've met hard left leaning ... oi ? 
  maybe we shod call tricity oi `` jo '' instead :p mixed bag for sure , but coming from a different region it was one of the things that stood out for me about the city . 
  gda\u0144sk citizens , despite being decidedly right-leaning , cherish the hanseatic , prussian and even teutonic heritage of the city . 
  that last one was most surprising to me since teutonic order has bad rep everywhere else in poland . 
  in general , gda\u0144sk citizens are to me an example of how positive patriotism can look like - they 're not concerned with trying to whitewash gda\u0144sk as secretly-actually-polish all this time - they [ embrace it 's history ] ( https://youtu.be/bkvrqqlstku ) , and focus on making it a great city . 
  i would say it 's a hanseatic city first and foremost though - throughout it 's history the city bucked authority of whatever government claimed it as its own . 
  they had their own thing going . 
  for fucks sake . 
  i did mention it was churchills plan , not mine , right ? 
  same race , but a part of forces would go from balkans to cut them off earlier . 
  in poland our grandparents remember what it means to be liberated by russians . 
  we remember who torched and razed gda\u0144sk . 
  we get chills at the thought of `` uhr , uhr !, 
  freu komme '' because we know who it happened to , our grandparents are more to us than a sidenote statistic in a history book . 
  but , when we tell about this pov , and longingly muse about what if churchills plan was allowed to cut off ussr armies before they went past their borders , we 're being told we 're ungrateful for the destruction and death russian `` liberators '' brought , and the 50 years of occupation and economical drainage that followed . 
  in 10 years only contemporary history geeks will remember russians were targetting hospitals and journalists and used specifically anti-civilian weaponry and tactics . 
  edit : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/yalta_conference#aborted_enforcement_plans, 
  and also detroit , memphis , oakland ... on grand scale of things , us places between uganda and venezuela : http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/crime/violent-crime/murder-rate, 
  sorry - i just have a nagging feeling that they 'll get to it eventually . 
  they are copying a lot of nixonian gop strategies , and this seems inevitable at this point , with disabled constitutional tribunal . 
  plz send opposition . 
  we 're all out of electable politicians , and pis is handing out moneys to low income voters . 
  they got elected with votes of 18,5 % elegible voters . 
  and how things are going , i 'm afraid there just is n't time to build viable opposition before next election . 
  shit 's gon na get even worse . 
  ca n't wait for when they redraw election districts - this anti democracy streak is like a step by step replay of worst gop tendencies ( newest limitatioms are like a copy of what happened in north carolina for example ) . 
  tbf , for all the resources us is spending , china and russia have been far more active in an open or semi-open way in past decade . 
  not sure how it 'll go from here with trumps understanding of `` cyber '' , but right now us is either holding their cards real close , or just way waaay behind china and russia . 
  http://www.infoworld.com/article/3132068/security/which-country-has-the-best-hackers-russia-or-china.html http://calvertjournal.com/features/show/3781/top-five-russian-hackers http://www.businessinsider.com/china-russia-hackers-cyber-criminals-2016-2?ir=t http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/china-russia-phishing-hacking-email/ the above are about criminal activities , but intelligence agencies do have a solid track record on recruiting criminals in exchange of turning a blind eye . 
  the real trick here is whether they can find an appropriate number of intelligence agents posing as diplomats , and if they can - do they want to just expel them instead of tracking their activities .
