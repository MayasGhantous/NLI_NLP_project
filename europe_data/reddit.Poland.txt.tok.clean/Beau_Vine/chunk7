  us focused on disrupting gru cyber activities , and forced trump to either flat out show he 's ignoring intelligence agencies , or play along . 
  what is the upside of russians blowing their load on who they know is an agent ? 
  has it occured to you that when you say `` everyone '' is like that it 's only people like you who are like that ? 
   rational dialogue is against human nature . 
  so is a bunch of things , like living in cities , monogamy , and getting from the big blue rock to the grey smaller rock orbiting it . 
  so is flying for fucks sake . 
  what kind of dipshit nihilistic ideology are right wingers grasping at lately ? 
  fuck off and live in a forest fighting bears for foraging area , if civilization is too idealistic for your badass , so-manly right wing delusions of grandeur . 
  oh , i thought the girl was trump and the tinder guy was putin ... 
  but to extend your parable , it 's like you then decided to divorce her before she gets the idea to check what _ you 've _ been doing on tinder . 
  since the initial cia communicate claimed the rnc was also compromised , their info just was n't leaked . 
  18,5 % of poles eligible to vote voted for pis . 
  and yet they act like god himself gives them mandate over 100 % of citizens . 
  i hope this will show our compatriots the importance of actually going out and casting a vote . 
  even an invalid ballot gets counted and is a better way to protest than abstaining completely , since it shows people with political aspirations that there are people dissatisfied with establishment who are _ active _ as voters . 
  because it _ is _ whataboutism . 
  especially when you alternate between `` well x does worse '' and `` we need to govern ourselves , not follow others '' depending on which one is convenient at that moment . 
  poland was a refuge to minorities from xiv to xviii century ( when we were wiped off the maps ) . 
  we were the second country to have a democratic constitution . 
  we 've had right to a fair trial and self representation back in xvii century . 
  `` others do worse than that '' is a sad step back in how we govern . 
  used to be we 've tried to expand freedom when others were curbing it down . 
  except from britain to poland this time ;-), 
  * what happens in poland is being misrepresented by dishonest media * liberalism is a mental disorder * other countries do worse than that do n't count on more varied or thought out arguments from pis supporters . 
  but also do n't worry too much about us in regard of authoritarianism . 
  we 're well versed and experienced in obstructing a government infringing on our freedoms . 
  in times when we 've had authoritarian police states try and cleanse our language and culture away from us - we 've invented this thing called terrorism ( 1903-1906 ) . 
  our national epic which covers [ a war against cossacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising ) supported by ottoman empire is glorifying heroes on both sides of the conflict , because cossacks were fighting for their freedoms . 
  do n't worry about poland - fighting our government is when we 're in our element . 
  and when it comes down to it , pis just does n't have the bench to support an oppressive regime . 
  they support loyalty to kaczy\u0144ski and party over all else . 
  do n't worry about poland becoming next turkey . 
  worry about us copying the greek model of constant giveaways to get votes . 
  awesome !, 
  gon na start with [ my message to millenials : how to change the world -- properly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xboeo_frzvg ) and see where it goes :d, 
  and on top of that , there 's this whataboutism doing rounds , where ( seemingly ) paid trolls try to normalize things like rampant corruption , abuse of office , lying in politics etc. 
  it always reminds me of experiments on how seeing repeated lie makes us question things you would n't believe you could be reliably manipulated about , like length of a rod you 're holding in your own hands . 
  * `` perceived lengths were found to be dependent on manner of manipulation and not necessarily equal to actual lengths . 
  '' * [ basic fucking shit ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/bf03206837 ) . 
  i highly recommend `` age of propaganda : the everyday use and abuse of persuasion '' by anthony pratkanis - it 's not systematic enough to call it a psychology texbook , but all chapters speak about specific studies . 
  but then again you can just pick up [ * `` the foundations of geopolitics : the geopolitical future of russia '' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) by alexander dugin , a textbook in the general staff academy of russian military . 
  from the babes mouth . 
  because that 's the thing - people fret over fucking conspiracies pettier and smaller than what is actually not a secret ( unless one genuinely thinks russia did n't invade georgia , did n't invade ukraine in response to their shift toward nato , etc - but it seems to me that those offering weak excuses for these also champion the `` politics are dirty , no point to make a fuss about it '' attitude , which makes me always dubt how genuine they are about anything . 
  phil zimbardo whose research sadly led to how cia prisons are now operated originally thought he was researching _ anti _ torture for navy . 
  his books are also a great introduction to this mess we 're having . 
  most people do n't read books about psychology . 
  as it progresses as science , laymen will fall further and further behind . 
  whole 50 's and 60 's psychologists deconstructed how nazi operated , on top of continuing to work on classic industrial psychology . 
  things that reliably improved ie how many mistakes a hired telegraph operator made , were then ignored by government who ordered the studies . 
  backlog of great procedures was being built up , until private companies invested . 
  and most of the time the effects are great , but corporations are rather indiscriminate about ethics when new revenue , or cutting cost is concerned . 
  / r/gunsarecool certainly have more fresh material every day than whats happens in europe . 
  i 'm a gun enthusiast , and sub it to keep me grounded . 
  kind of scares me how stories of gross negligence are reported in us as some magical , inexplicable acts of god . 
  whole silesia is out of whack , but that 's pretty standard for maps of that period . 
  they also pretty commonly misspellings , my hometown is actually more commonly spelled wrong than correctly ( sadly , did n't fit on this map ) . 
  this map seems to focus on shorelines , and everything else just got thrown in there . 
  breslau ( wroc\u0142aw ) ratibor and cracov are hilariously smooshed together as well , pretty sure other regions are out of whack as well . 
  and all over europe and all over the world . 
  the duertes , trumps , kaczynskis , le pens ... not sure if this point is repeated elsewhere , but in 2016 it became popular among right wing supporters here to say in an off-hand/matter of fact way , that liberalism is a mental disorder . 
  for all their bible thumping , they seem to have missed matthew gospel ...  `` and why worry about a speck in your friend 's eye when you have a log in your own ? '', 
  eu is made out of member nations . 
  there 's no `` it '' or `` they '' it 's `` us '' and `` we '' . 
  our ai overlords will force rhat on us eventually . 
  makes most sense in era of digitalization, 
  mods , it 's a trap !, 
  y' all agree on what `` rakija '' means first . 
  plum-based only , or is black currant , honey etc in the running as well ? 
  i reccomend reading the book polscy terrory\u015bci - i doubt it changes your stance , but it sheds some light on role prussia has had in us regaining independence ( in short - to fuck with russians they helped militants smuggle weapons , ammunition and books into the russian occupied territories ) . 
  as for what 'd make you pick it up - it deals with years back when pi\u0142sudski was robbing trains ( with hilarious results ) , and will explain the famous quote `` towarzysze , jecha\u0142em czerwonym tramwajem socjalizmu a\u017c do przystanku `` niepodleg\u0142o\u015b\u0107 '' , ale tam wysiad\u0142em '' . 
  it 's moatly direct quotes from documents , diaries etc with author providing only some structure and commentary . 
  maybe you were . 
  but take into account that commenter is from mazovia , and lmay know about polish-german relations from what he cared to learn out of what little history is being taught in our schools . 
  moreso that that , each of our regions tend to mythologize different parts of it . 
  germans are well liked in many areas - gda\u0144sk was a surprise to me because of it 's history ( and then even more surprised to discover it 's because not despite the level of common knowledge of history of the region ) , but in western pomerania , great poland , opolen - in short in the regions that actually interact with germans - the common sentiment is respect with varying degree of distrust . 
  source of that distrust is also a source of respect - what i 've heard called positive patriotism . 
  germans strongly favour german brands and working with other german companies . 
  we used to have that , but then sort of choked on the novelty of west , automatically puttig western brands above ours . 
  now that people are re-evaluating this attitude , germans are a close example of how we should 've treated polish companies , but also a threat - because we do n't and you do , and our businesses compete . 
  outside of business , football is another example of this , and people without contact with industry often mention this - we have so many great players . 
  so why do they need to go to germany to play , and develop ? 
  there 's plenty of people here wih strong dislike for germans , but it almost always seems rooted in selective knowledge of our history ( or virtually no knowledge of when we cooperated ) , distrust due to business dealings , bitterness that due to yalta and then ussr regime denying marshall plan money germans came out of wwii stronger than ever and we ended up under occupation and in ruin . 
  all in all , a pole has to go out of his way to develop amity for our western neighbours . 
  and yet , wherever we cooperate - business , academics , hobbies ( you gave us khaldor ! ), 
  germans are liked , or at very least admired . 
  see , that 's why imho tossed salad  melting pot . 
  in this spirit of spirit sharing , and to clear czechs name in this dep - [ bohemian style absinthe with a fire ritual ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemian-style_absinth ) is a lovely , if deadly , mistress . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/75zmij_4lfq ) edit : i could n't pass that setup , but for the record poles have a debt of gratitude to ottoman empire [ for standing up for their beloved enemy lechistan ] ( http://poloniaottomanica.blogspot.com/2014/02/where-is-deputy-of-lehistan.html?m=1 ) during our stint off the maps . 
  dislike for erdogan regime = / = dislike for turks . 
  they 're a beer country though . 
  near the border `` czeska w\u00f3dka '' or just `` czeska '' is an euphemism for low quality vodka . 
  they have amazing beers , a wide selection of flavouted hard spirits , and even some good wines . 
  but vodka is an afterthought there . 
  until pale ales became popular and common , and small/medium craft brands started popping up , czech lagers , stouts and bocks were my favourite . 
  many hold czech beers above german , dutch or british ones . 
  hard liquors though ... let 's just say the proposition is not without merit . 
  but not because hard liquors are popular there , quite the opposite . 
  tl , dr : there 's many ways to get wasted . 
  czechs poison of choice is hop-based . 
  i doubt that was the intent , but the prussian just happens to knee kick that tentacle works historically - prussians helped communist terrorists in poland ( what can i say .
