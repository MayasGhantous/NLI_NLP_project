  we 've had colourful moments ) smuggle weapons and explosives . 
  they even provided warehouses . 
  `` polscy terrory\u015bci '' - great read , about future ministers , prime ministers and a certain mustached marshall robbing trains at a gunpoint , among other things . 
  i have no idea what you 're on about now . 
  quote please , our comments were rather long . 
  what did i say was n't going to happen ? 
  why join nato ? 
  maybe so that if russians want to invade us it ca n't be handwaived easily as `` politics as usual '' by people like you . 
  or so that there 's even a token presence of forces from other countries so that if we 're invaded there 's a semblance of third party observing and providing information on what 's going on . 
  i know there 's people with no sense of loyalty to allies , that does n't mean i extend that critique to nato as whole . 
  i 'm not going to engage you on other points . 
  how can i convince you of anything when you declare it 's just `` hate festering in my heart '' . 
  that 's some intense shit . 
  i thought hey had legal weed up there ? 
  you ostensibly need to take a chill pill mate . 
  so you see and mention yourself that the countries most eager for us troops presence are the ones that have already been occupied by russia at various times in history . 
  my grandparents remember both nazi and soviet soldiers and remember which were more barbaric ( perhaps less efficient in murdering civilians , but beating nazi in raw numbers ) . 
  my great grandfather was in a gulag . 
  and there you are , supposedly an englishman in netherlands , downplaying fears of those who know what it is to have russia invade your country ... do you know why it 's a relief to me to have us troops stationed here ? 
  because i fear that if russians were to invade us , or lithuania - germans and beits are no more ready to die for warsow than they were 80 years ago . 
  that in case of invasion there will be people like you , eating up kremlin propaganda and shrugging us off not as an ally , not as a country whos soldiers died besides yours , but as an `` ex soviet state russians invade because politics '' . 
  poor little defenceless russia , that peace dove feels threatened by token bases of nato forces . 
  suuuuure . 
  and even if - cry me a river . 
  anything that halts putin appetites . 
  and as you admitted yourself , that 's most common in countries that are actually within his grasp . 
  oh , so invading ukraine and georgia is no biggie on the well established rule of * i ` mnottouchingyoui ` mnottouchingyou * , supporting separatists in donbass near our border is no biggie because of above rule paired with * stop hitting yourself * , but us brigade as far from what little border we have with russia is clearly an unprecedented provocation ? 
  how the fuck does that threaten russia ? 
  a 400 men brigade is only good as a deterrent in case of an invasion , hardly a force to be the first in over 400 years to succesfully invade russia . 
  i would n't say you were asleep . 
  i do n't even doubt your knowledge and understanding of situation and how it looks to countries that until 90 's were occupied by russians ( last russian units left legnica in 1993 ) . 
  i think you 're quite consciously manipulating facts and kremlin talking points , either for fun or some other reason . 
  a popular pasttime lately . 
  you 've ever read enders game ? 
  well they 've been doing that for years . 
   ` close to our borders , russia continues its assertive military posturing , ' said nato secretary general jens stoltenberg on wednesday . 
   ` this month alone , russia has deployed nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad and suspended a weapons-grade plutonium agreement with the united states . 
   ` and russia continues to destabilize eastern ukraine with military and financial support for the separatists . 
  they also have a habit of violating airspace of all countries bordering with them or nearby . 
  and do stunts like this : http://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-warplanes-fly-close-to-u-s-navy-destroyer-polish-helicopter-1460549626 edit : forgot about wsj paywall , here 's an article by the guardian : https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/13/russian-attack-planes-buzz-uss-donald-cook-baltic-sea so they invade neighbours , station troops with nuclear capabilities near our borders , regularly violate airspace , or fly close enough that interceptors have to be launch , fund separatists in donbass despite agreeing not to ... 
  but it 's the us who supposedly waves their dong around ? 
  at least us dong waving is welcome here there 's a reason why estonia and poland ( and iirc lithuania from next year ) are the only nato countries besides uk , us and greece who reached the set 2,5 % of gdp on defence . 
  because russian invasion is a much more tangible threat here . 
  citizens above 50-60 years old remember what it 's like to live under their boot . 
  and give more weight to the news coming out of there because we 're so close . 
  politics of appeasement make more sense the farther you are from the regime being appeased . 
  ugh , that was the boring and stable zone of occupation .

  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) they 're busy bees building a mythos , and removing anyone who queations it . 
  just between january and march they fired 200 journalists , and did n't slow down until june when most started to fall in line to keep their jobs . 
  the troubling thing is that author of this article took their bait . 
  with alt-reich carefully building narratives and coining terms , journalists need to stop slacking off and rephrasing official communicates . 
  : i 'm tempted to take the bait myself based on some other comments . 
  but that 's how they get ya . 
  rile us up and make us infight instead of questioning their methods and mandate . 
  no , non jewish poles caught the name of the director and this tidbit :  however , poland 's ambassador in germany przy\u0142\u0119bski requested the screening of the propaganda film smolensk instead .

  eh , said the guy from a country which had a fucking pedo political party until 2014 . http://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/04/netherlands-high-court-bans-pedophile-group.php here 's the thing about this case , and subjects like the anti-abortion laws recently : it 's a political circus to divert attention from all the fronts our government has opened . 
  next major manifestation of opposition will be on dec 13 , and media are already talking about it . 
  i expect at least 2 more subjects like this before then , since pretty much nobody in poland took this bait . 
  if pis extradited him and us tried him for other charges , they 'd invite further comparisons to communist regime . 
  hence no extradition . 
  it is a political tool to have people talk about it instead of ie recent legislation limiting citizens right to manifestations . 
  the reason i got pissed off is because i 've been involved with various ngos for last 12 years , and they are pretty much all funded by people involved with them , and have a very wide range of things they deal with . 
  funnily enough , most of people i know via ngos are very much anti-immigrant ( but that 's probably because of the kind of ngos i come in contact ) . 
   do n't worry , we 're exporting the post-fact thing to europe .

  what what the the fuck fuck ? 
  you seem to have zero ( no , nada , null , 0 , none ) knowledge of what the fuck are you talking about . 
  ngo 's from my region ( about 100 km radius ) that i know of ( there are many , many more ) : ** 3 ** historical reenactment groups , sometimes getting partial funding for events that promote tourism or local history ( mostly volunteer-ran and self-funded ) . 
  ** 4 ** competitive shooting groups , two of which who get small funding for events which commemorate various veteran groups ( mostly volunteer-ran and self funded though ) ** 2 ** ngo 's that teach dancing in small villages with fuck-all to do otherwise . 
  mostly self-funded , though most of their gigs are for various town fairs ( ie a town has a wine festival , they get hired ) ** 1 ** ngo hiring a few lawyers , accountants etc who help other ngo 's with formalities . 
  it 's through them that i got to know most of the others as they try to get as many ngo 's together once a year as possible , in part to combat the kind of idiocy you 're projecting . 
  ** 2 ** ngos that promote general activity and show people what servicemen do every day . 
  one is ran by cops , the other by firefighters and mountain rescuers . 
  ** 1 ** ngo that brings books to remore villages ** 10 + ** dealing with various issues touching kids in more remote areas - music , dance , learning etc. 
  yourself . 
  it 's people like you , who spout of their opinions regardless of knowledge they have on an issue that have brought us the `` post-fact '' bs . 
  there is no shame in being ignorant . 
  every person on earth is ignorant of 99 , ( 9 ) % of total knowledge people as whole have gathered . 
  but please , restrain yourself from trying to influence others when you clearly do not know what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  true . 
  but if i believed there was a god , and depending on the church either gave us literal stories of back when he still tinkered around , or inspired such stories ... 
  i think i 'd read that . 
  it is literally _ a _ book . 
  a lot of it hangs on stuff like changes in letter transcription , translations and cultural context , but many editions have that included and it 's still less to read than lord of the rings . 
  if you have n't read the bible , have never shown interest in what catholic scholars say about it , and spend your time in church thinking about dinner , and your personal beliefs are often antithesis of what that arab ( ick ! ), 
  carpenter preached ... ( assuming you know _ what _ he preached in the first place . 
  republican jesus does n't count  i 'd love to hear what is it that makes you a catholic . 
  not practice , not knowing the philosophy , not moral alignment . 
  what then ? 
  enjoying the festivities ? 
  i even observe friday fast , because damn , got ta eat fish someday .
