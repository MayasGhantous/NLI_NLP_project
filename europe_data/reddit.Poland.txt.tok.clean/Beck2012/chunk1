my heart stopped for a second , before i realized that it did n't happen in poland . 
  and it would be unconstitutional in poland . 
  [ this tweet sums it up nicely ] ( https://twitter.com/peterkuznetsov/status/530683962705063936 ) . 
  no , wars are n't particularly funny . 
  being better than warsaw .

  well , they 're obliged to begin talks ( according to agreements ) . 
  and most likely the gas will be cheaper , if we manage to enforce selling gas by market value . 
  currently we pay more than e.g. 
  germany , which is not economically viable . 
  and they can not use political issues in gas selling . 
  if the outcome will be bad for us , we 'll sue them to the arbitral court in stockholm . 
  also :  neighboring lithuania , which has been fully dependent on gazprom supplies , got a 23 percent price reduction for the russian fuel in may , just months before opening its floating lng facility . 
  lithuania had paid about 1,200 litai ( $ 484 ) per 1,000 cubic meters for russian gas before the cut , according to the verslo zinios newspaper . 
  we 're going to have our own lng terminal in \u015awinouj\u015bcie , so it 's another argument in favour of lowering the price .

  lobsters are found in sea , look and taste diffrently . 
  according to wikipedia , it 's european crayfish , or noble crayfish . 
  sadly , i 've never eaten it . 
  serial suicider . 
  sure , i agree !, 
  i 've bought `` kuchnia lwowska '' cookbook some time ago - many recipes with lemons , oranges , raki ( crabs ? 
  windows 8.1 . 
  and some kind of android on my samsung 10.1 . 
  i 've used linux ( do n't remember which , probably ubuntu ) but i simply do n't need it anymore . 
  no , no . 
  they can be polish . 
  they just try to pressure you by saying that you 're a wet blanket if you do n't want to celebrate halloween ( i do n't even know what should i do ? 
  carve something in a pumpkin ? 
  why would i do that - just so i have a carved pumpkin ? 
  my younger brother has this theory , that only nations that drink kompot , are civilised . 
  pretty bold theory , but i like it . 
  i prefer plum kompot . 
  all those sour variants are really cool , when i was a kid strawberry was my favourite . 
  shame that you did n't understand my post . 
  it 's not like-don ' t like dychotomy . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kompot it 's polish national non-alcoholic drink . 
  we drink it to dinner ( although our dinner is in a lunch time ) . 
  do n't treat bigos as something bad ( and i 'm not talking about / u/bigos here ) !, 
  if you use plums , \u015bliwowica , high quality meat ( venison !, 
  ) , cold cuts ( good kie\u0142basa ja\u0142owcowa ) it becomes a culinary * majstersztyk * . 
  good bigos = / = bigos from sto\u0142\u00f3wka ( cheap kie\u0142basa with some cabbage , bleh ) . 
  moreover - without internalization of values of such holiday - it 's not a holiday . 
  special celebration should come from an internal need of a community , not from some kind of `` fashion '' ( celebrating death of someone important is rational , clelebrating halloween because kids in some kind of sitcom do so is not ) . 
  hah , not necessarily . 
  there is something like peer pressure - i 've written about it in other comment . 
  i do , because my name is patrick . 
  well , i 'm not really fond of dressing up . 
  i can dress up for a party , but when it becomes some kind of pressure ( `` it 's halloween , you have to dress up for a party ) , well , i 'm going to be a dick about it . 
  which does n't change much , because i have enough to do before all saints - i do n't have time for halloween . 
  but still , i 'm against homogenization - cultures are diffrent and it 's cool . 
  everyone should celebrate holidays that are common in one 's culture ( it may happen that some holiday will be absorbed into a particular culture , but it 's a long process , and i do n't see it happening in case of halloween in poland ) . 
  oh , i forgot to add that i was born in 1990 !, 
  :-d but i doubt anyone drank water , kompot and tea were a norm for many , many years ( before soda or juices became popular ) . 
  sure they know . 
  and being disgusted by a traditional cusine , a dish made without any additives ( natural gelatine - quite easy and inteligent way to make an aspic , and god so tasty ) is pretty childish . 
  it is polish `` turkish style '' coffee . 
  i 've drank it probably once in my life , it 's vile . 
  i 'll stick to espresso . 
  it 's an irish holiday , i do n't understand why we should celebrate something so alien to our culture ( i 'm writing about poland ) . 
  \u015amingus-dyngus is cool , but i doubt it will be popular in the us , nor do i see any reason for them to celebrate this folk holiday . 
   old slavic , nordic , germanic , finnish , etc. 
  traditions the problem is , we know almost nothing about proto-slavic ( pre-christian ) religion . 
  at least in poland - we have no idea what they believed in , or even how they called their gods . 
  and most of so caled studies , are bunch of suppositions without any clear evidence . 
  i doubt i 've ever drank water at kindergarden . 
  we either drank tea or kompot . 
   herring in jelly i reallly like aspics . 
  usually , we eat it only on christmas in my house ( carp aspic ) , but when i 'm drinking at a * pijalnia * ( there are those places in poland which have really cheap alcohol and basic food like aspic , steak tartar , strogonoff etc. 
  and are open 24/7 ) i usually get a pork aspic . 
  goes well with w\u00f3dka or beer . 
  mine too . 
  no gift giving , huge celebration - just spending time with your family , visiting graves . 
  simple and beautiful . 
  there is no rivalry , warsaw just sucks . 
  that 's true . 
  but the argument is not about functioning democracy ( although , hitler was elected in functioning democracy ) , but about autocracy . 
  autocrats might not be bad - there is no rule that says , that they have to be bad people . 
  but yeah , democracy gives us instruments to prevent bad things to happen . 
  yes , it is . 
  but there are examples of countries deterioriating after implementing democracy . 
  libya is one of them , i 'd say that tito 's yugoslavia was far more prosperous than 1990s balkans ( war and whatnot ) . 
  and queue-robot : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_u2mvxdism, 
  they do it , so the cause is remembered . 
  like ryszard siwiec or jan palach . 
  still , it was possible to own a small forest . 
  collectivization was a big failure in poland . 
  i 've written about it few months ago in / r/asksocialscience , but i have troubles with finding it ( or was it / r/europe ? 
  i 'm not sure ) . 
  which is pretty sad , \u017cupan and kontusz look badass . 
  they should be our kimonos . 
  it 's probably diffrent in diffrent countries . 
  generally you can have a private forest in eu ( there are even special grants for that - i 've heard of `` traveling forests '' in greece , which were moved from place to place to simulate a real forest for the aerial photographies needed to obtain such grants ; i have no idea if it 's true ) . 
  according to the state forests national forest holding , 17 % of forests in poland are private .
