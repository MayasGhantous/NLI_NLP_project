  also , a song : [ parovoz - biedronka ( lidl ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dujyctyaqsi ), 
  [ kosmos lied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ypobi_vwdw ) by thomas lueck . 
  ddr kosmos-rock . 
  yeah , that one 's pretty controversial . 
  but he is a lot smaller and touches his nards now . 
  [ lenin on a walk - vertically ] ( http://wklag.prv.pl/img/lenin5.jpg ) - nowa huta , krak\u00f3w , poland . 
  and a stag party in krak\u00f3w , poland . 
  for last few years i 've been mainly traveling through asia . 
  :-( nevermind , bigos is the highest point of polish culinary culture . 
  we 've even got a [ guy in poland 's got talent ] ( http://www.video.banzaj.pl/film/6588/jedzenie-bigosu-na-czas-w-mam-talent/ ) who ate bigos competetively . 
  our national hero . 
  you 've got mama\u0142yga , ireland got something that looks like mashed potatoes , lativa did n't even get a potato - everything 's okay . 
  wow , i am so hurt . 
  i think i will now go to my bed to cry a little bit . 
  germans did such thing in 1939 - they 've attacked poland after a show known as `` gleiwitz provocation/incident '' . 
   redditor for one day  unsubscribes again, 
  i know all of this , i 'm from zakopane . 
  giewont is a symbol - mountain overlooking zakopane , this is a magnificent view , do n't you think ? 
  internationally renowned eu was also naive in believing putin in the first place . 
  his concerns are valid . 
  [ that 's hiv kind of slutty ] ( http://natchem.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/global_hivprevalence_2007.png ) . 
  and he probably thinks about slovenia . 
  i 'd replace morskie oko with [ giewont ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrgdvckjkbv1hpyjknof5tdcnnaijbh7mv1p4lddb3xugutog01gq ) , it 's much more symbolic . 
  also , [ hel ] ( http://www.gohel.pl/uploads/assets/fotki/marek/helzlotu.jpg ) , which is also pretty significant both as natural phenomenon and one of main points of our national identity ( poland from hel to giewont , something like that ) . 
  wawel is cool , but in krak\u00f3w far more impressive is [ main market square ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcmd04u8q31ryfb3ho1_1280.jpg ) with one of the oldest churches in poland ( saint wojciech 's / adalbert 's ) , probably the most famous church in poland ( saint mary 's cathedral ) , sukiennice and town hall tower . 
  main market is the biggest medieval market square in the world/in europe . 
  and hercules ' club should be replaced with [ masurian lakes ] ( http://biura-podrozy.erz.pl/upload/biura-podrozy.erz.pl/mazury_kraina_1.jpg ) . 
  cool , oravsky hrad , i 've been there two days ago . 
  :-) and the nearest lidl for me amt is in trstena , just bought there a beer for 22 eurocents . 
  was n't good but still was better than any hungarian beer ever made . 
  primo : that 's not a free market , if you have a monopolist . 
  secundo : of course someone forces multiple countries to deal with russia . 
  russia does this . 
  we were supposed to have a gas pipe from norway , but our former pm - miller , communist who was a pm in early 2000s , canceled the deal . 
  and up to few years ago a term `` diversification '' was ridiculed by post-commies . 
  the same people that were part of infamous `` moscow loan '' -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_loan, 
  that 's because ode to joy is not eu anthem , it 's europe 's anthem . 
  http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukcesja_tronu_w_polsce sorry for no editing , it 's more clear on the wiki page . 
  i think that the deal with the wettins is primarly the question if abolishing the constitution was legal ( one may argue it was done under foreign pressure ) . 
  the second pretendent do the throne from wettins is [ ruediger ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%bcdiger_von_sachsen ) . 
  also , [ maria emmanuel ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_emanuel_ks._saski ) was a great man . 
  they also prevent war from happening . 
  this , and nuclear arsenal of both alliances . 
  that 's why the war was cold . 
   i did not calculate how much money each country would loose . 
  how am i blabbering ? 
  why are you rude ? 
  you have posted a comment , i have replied . 
  then , you 've posted :  i did not calculate how much money each country would loose . 
  so i 've provided you with data . 
  i can not fathom how is it not relevant in a thread like this , or why would you ahve a problem with that . 
  i have provided you with data to support my case . 
  what is wrong with that ? 
  wot is from belarus . 
  that 's because they enjoy it . 
  i 'm just providing you with data , that shows that neither germany , nor denmark , are hit as much as you 've thought . 
  no , no . 
  greeks would enjoy it . 
  fuck yeah , no warsaw . 
  waiting for valve to join sanctions . 
  it would be a delight to play dota2 without our lovely neighbour state citizens . 
  cyka . 
  denmark is seventh : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/buc6maxcaaiyx2j.jpg, 
  o_o seriously ? 
  oh , honey . 
  denmark is far behind poland according to this chart - you have reasonable share in the two smallest groups of products and are second in second biggest . 
  poland owns 1/4th of the biggest one and is third in second and fourth . 
  three categories in which denmark are present are smallest than the biggest one , in which lithuania represents over 1/4th . 
  lithuania might be losing more than you ( and it is ) . 
  well , that 's sounds about right . 
  still 1 . 
  what a shitty map . 
  yeah , sure , i was supporting you in the margwelanshwili thing !, 
  i was questioning what / u/savannajeff wrote in a comment above yours . 
  i was thinking reptilian overlords . 
   russians did n't start the 2008 war debatable . 
  and calling choice made by georgians as a pro-russian one ... 
  it was rather an anti-saakashwili decision , margwelashwili remains a pro-eu politician and he campaigned himself as such . 
  he just sought a normalisation with russia , which , probably , is no more important - besides , send us some of this delicious georgian wine and borzhomi mineral water , we 'll drink it all . 
  you forgot about poland . 
  this need more attention , it 's basically news of the day . 
  anne applebaum 's comment on that is spot on :  anne applebaum @anneapplebaum 21m  putin blocks food imports from the west . 
  in other words , ** russia sanctions itself ** http://on.wsj.com/1swbf1n, 
  i 've heard that they get rash because of it . 
  which would be 11:30 -12:30 hours in air . 
  i agree , great prices , good on-board service and multimedia . 
  probably . 
  nevertheless , this myth helped our ancestor create a democratic `` noble nation '' back in 16th century , three hundred years before nationalism was born . 
  never mind , we 're higher than you !, 
  we were sarmatians and kicked asses ( [ 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarmatism ) and [ 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarmatia ) ) . 
   word of advice , english does n't really have a word for onion farmers ( or if we do no one uses it ) and it 's spelled businesses . 
  your english is great , just thought you might want to know and no offense meant ( i ca n't speak any polish ) . 
  well , i have worked in goverenment institution coresponding with third parties in english , so ... thanks ? 
  1 ) i didn / ' t want to bother with spell-check , 2 ) i was after a few beersm 3 ) i was n't writing about onion farmers , but about producer unions . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  it 's easy to pass this kind of judgement as an arm-chair investor , reality is much more complicated than that . 
  agricultural goods are probably hardest to trade on international market - vast majority of countries have high tariffs on such products ( the most notable is eastern asian countries policy on rice ) . 
  thankfully , our governments ( and eu ) were doing * something * in this matter - the role of wto , which encourages lowering tariffs on agricultural goods is also important . 
  we are already diversifying our customer-base ( last year we 've started selling pork to south korea ) . 
  but it 's not `` their '' ( producers ) fault , they do n't diversify enough , it 's a political thing .
