  also , even if there were three markets availible - china , russia and , let 's say , uae , most of producers ( of some kind of producer unions , i do n't know english term for that ) will sell to russia . 
  that 's because it 's far easier to do so - often there is hardly to no language barrier ( how many people in poland speak hanyu or arabic ? 
  ) , contacts ( how many people in poland know apple selling companies in china/uae ? 
  ) , and also - it 's close , so you can use your neighbours transportation company , no need to look for some kind of overseas freight firm . 
  source : my professional experiance and education ; also , you can search for a report on polish bussines in china , it 's from last year , very enlightening - companies in poland do not know how to do anything in far eastern markets , they have literally no experience . 
  it 's not a butthurt . 
  sanctions were imposed by an eu as one body and poland is the one of the member states , that was hit by a retaliation embargo ( in last 10 years we were usually embargoed `` just because '' , this time there is at least a more meaningful cause behind it ) . 
  eu should help member states in times like that ( and it goes for every country that russia considers its fromer property - baltic states , romania and so on ) . 
  french electronic music ( and german - i 'm thinking of kraftwerk ) from this period of time is really good . 
  [ an apple a day keeps the ~ ~ doctor ~ ~ away ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m0qs0nr.jpg ), 
  i 've been there about 8 years ago . 
  sad , that there is no kind of memorial or museum . 
  the only thing you can get are some lousy post cards . 
  yep , in this action people are encouraged to eat both fresh apples and processed . 
  cider included . 
  chinese students are taught latin alphabet earlier than hanzi . 
  it 's just very useful in teaching proper pronounciation of words . 
  they are also taught english words pronounciation in some idiotic way ( e.g. 
  they are taught that `` poor '' is pronounced the same way as [ \u7834 ] ( https://translate.google.pl/#zh-cn/pl/%e7%a0%b4 ) ) . 
  as for koreans , they know some english words from their own language - like [ \uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20\uce74 or sports car ] ( https://translate.google.pl/#en/ko/sports%20car ) . 
  [ \uc624\ud508\uce74 means convertible ] ( https://translate.google.pl/#ko/en/%ec%98%a4%ed%94%88%ec%b9%b4 ) . 
  beer is poland 's drink of choice . 
  and nalewka is our hobby/special drink . 
  you can buy dozens diffrent types in a shop , but homemade are the best ( with lemon vodka being probably one of the most popular and best - kwa\u015bne jest dobre ) . 
  i think that 's because many of them were sang by soldiers during the war , like [ ein heller un ein batzen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slotkpvqcls ) . 
  and a glorious [ heino version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziww35zbvbi ) .

  haha , there is this very , very polish dish called `` placki po wegiersku '' - they 're obviously not hnugarian , they just consist goulash-like prepared meat with sauce . 
  but i 've had something like that in eger ( at the same time you can eat it at ever polish restaurant ) . 
  the same story is with `` fasolka po bretonsku '' . 
  no correlation with bretagne ( however you write it , french people ) , it is , however , a great bar/pub dish . 
  easy , greasy , tomat-y and kielbas-y . 
  onion is a queen of vegetables . 
  potato is a king . 
  so does honey boo boo . 
  you mean ruskie ? 
  they 're with potato-cheese-onion filling and are glorious . 
  l\u0105dek . 
  how does it not ? 
  russia is still part of europe , at least geography tells us so . 
  we all love irony and it is an irony , thus all those upvotes . 
  from my own experience - twitter , fb and web pages are usually handled by interns . 
  and half of them are utter idiots . 
  you 're wrong . 
  maybe it was your teacher in hs , but we are taught pretty extensively on this topic . 
  with focus on the reasons and the beginning of war ( alliances [ i remember learning year , when alliances between entante cordiale and central countries were signed ] , crisises like moroccan crisis , ofc gavrilo , bombing of kalisz etc. 
  ) , some of the biggest battles ( somma , verdun , intervention of taxi drivers in paris  ) , and of course the end of the war and our , polish-bolshevik war , silesian uprisings , greater poland uprising and so on . 
  those are things that are in our textbooks ( or at least , they were - now there is a switch to non-fact , customs focused history teaching ) . 
  we call it french disease in poland . 
  one may also say `` gdzie psy dupami szczekaj\u0105 '' - `` where dogs are barking with their asses '' . 
  seriously ? 
  in poland we attribute it to english . 
  actually , poland ( or commonwealth ) did not expand through war . 
  except for out involvment in smuta/dimitriads , we were pretty much ones being invaded . 
  it 's good that those materials are being published - other way , the government would be blackmailed all the time . 
  if he 's the best minister ... let 's say that the situation in the ministry is not the best - he promised to make some structural changes , he did n't do a thing ( there is huge mismanagement in every ministry , but i know situation in this one and it 's not good ) . 
  he is also too focused on his own ambitions , so european politics are not just most important in mofa , their only foreign politics they do . 
  and , as sienkiewicz has mentioned , there is no coordination ( in this case - in one ministry ) . 
  sikorski is a bad minister . 
  very bad minister , to be honest . 
  and he 's screwed - i doubt he 'll get his dream job at nato or eu . 
  he 's also no longer credible as a head of diplomacy .

   they go excellently on pumpernickel with some eggs and curried mayonnaise . 
  and w\u00f3dka . 
  we eat a lot of herring in poland ( just the way you 've described ; perfect breakfest for me , just add some onion to eggs and mayonnaise ) but we especially like it as a snack to w\u00f3dka . 
  we call it `` metka tatarska '' . 
  delicious thing , especially with good bread and fresh butter . 
  there 's also / r/poland . 
  which has got bigger community . 
  no , threat of force exists . 
  father of a girl from my class back in hishschool was arrested for trafficking girls from the east . 
  he was basically a slave trader . 
  and to / u/alofat - legallization might be a way , but does n't have to be one . 
  we need strong disencouragement of getting prostitutes among men . 
  legal booze , tobacco and drugs does n't prevent people from getting this substances from illeagal market - in case of prostitution , black market probably should stay big in case of total legalization - because it 's better not to pay taxes , if you can . 
  and i ca n't imagine people going to court with cases against pimps and hookers . 
  you really do n't understand that most of the prostitutes are trafficked from poor regions to the west ? 
  they often do n't have any choice whatsoever . 
  and prostitution is not a problem in europe . 
  it 's a problem in thailand with rampant diseases , half-slavery type of relation and drug abuse . 
  and it 's mainly fueled by creeps from sweden , germany , australia , usa , india , japan and arabs ( i do n't have anything against people from those coutries/those nations , but they are main source of clients ) . 
  prostitution is the main reason there is still slavery in the world , do not forget about it . 
   polish gangs we 've pretty much dealt with organized crime back in the late 90s , i think . 
  hey , we were there too , you know !, 
  in my area and family there was a myth of `` good kaiser franz-joseph '' . 
  the fact that for the second half of the zabory it was the least oppresive occupation is undeniable . 
  but for a long time , austrians acted like typical imperialist scum : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galician_slaughter ( austrians paid for noblemen heads ) . 
  no , the situation was diffrent , cz-sk attacked us when we were fighting against bolsheviks and took zaolzie . 
  because i 'll be coming back from malaysia ( actually , first i 'm going for a few days to japan and then to bangkok , but i 've lived in kl for the last three months ) with finnair . 
  and i wo n't leave the airport . 
  but i 've been there already , so that 's okay . 
  i hope that me and my friends will go to croatia this september to relax before new semester . 
  he probably meant listerine . 
  booze is okay . 
  that does n't work that way . 
  you sum up all acts , so it does n't matter if he steals 200 , 200 and 200 - it 's as if he stole 600 at once .

  i can play it for hours , there are several variations of this game and you have to think a lot while you play it ( especially when more elaborate rules are in play ) .
