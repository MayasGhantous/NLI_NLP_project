  the variation of ** chuj ** that is also quite popular is ** gypsy ** ( cygan ) - you play it like chuj , but have to put your cards face down and tell , what card are you playing . 
  if you 've lied and someone checks , you have to take all cards on the table . 
  1000 is also very popular among younger people - me and my friends used to play 1000 and chuj pretty often . 
  bridge is very popular , but people that play bridge usually do n't play any other card game . 
  as for korwin-mikke : no , he did n't . 
  in polish criminal law you have to instigate a sepcific person to commit a crime , to be accused of a crime of instigation . 
  oh , just shut the fuck up . 
  i 'm a catholic , polish and a westerner . 
  as we all are . 
  catholicism is western , if you do n't know . 
  orthodox church is eastern . 
  eot . 
   the use of these terms , explicitly mentioning `` poland '' or `` polish '' , has been discouraged by the polish and israeli governments , polish diaspora organizations around the world , and jewish organizations such as the american jewish committee . 
  those were german camps on polish soil . 
  industrial areas in turku , finland . 
  chumphon , hat yai in southern thailand - there is nothing to see in the southern part of thailand , except for beaches and islands ( ko phi phi , ko samui , krabi , phuket ) . 
  hat yai is an industrial town ( and third biggest in thailand with about 200 000 inhabitants ) and there is absolutely nothing to see there . 
  but i had great time eating best chicken rice in my life there . 
  and drinking beers . 
  one big-ass mosque ( only for muslims , if you 're not a believer - no entry for you , pal ) , sulatn 's palace and that 's pretty much it . 
   eastern europe boo !, 
  this is one of the happiest days this year . 
  it 's always good to hear about a death of communist dictator . 
  wow , mature . 
  they should be from greece !, 
  thanks for installing another totalitarian dictatorship . 
  that 's not that much at all . 
  staying at good hotels , traveling by planes and getting good quality materials ( books cost ! ), 
  - those things are expensive . 
  not to mention a good banquet , you can throw 10 000 euros and it would not be extravagant at all ( and i imagine that this kind of event wil take place ) . 
  50 000 euros are also aimed at other possible recepients . 
  imagine how costly would it be to get someone from , let 's say , fiji , with his assitants ( 100 % sure that the winner travels accompanied by spuse and some advisors ) . 
  because swedish plants are world-famous for blowing up with no reason . 
  and it 's especially bad for those that decide not to participate . 
  a bit of all three . 
  we barely accept any foreigners on basis of political persecutions in their country ( for some time we accepted chechenyans , now if you 're somali , you 'll be allowed to stay ) . 
  but still , poland is not a popular destination ( except for ukrainians and vietnamese ) . 
  also , some of people living in poland are not counted as immigrants ( count in loads of spanish erasmus students ) . 
  we have a lot of sour dishes in our cuisine . 
  bigos , \u017curek , herring , pierogi z kapust\u0105 ... and we really like our kapusta kiszona ( sauerkraut ! ), 
  and og\u00f3rki kiszone ( pickled cucumber ) . 
  we pickle a lot of things ... 2 . 
  our national non-alcoholic drink is [ herbata z cytryn\u0105 ] ( http://mamawformie.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/herbata-z-cutryn%c4%85.jpg ) . 
  hot tea with sugar and lemon . 
  we drink it all the time . 
  we drink more beer than w\u00f3dka . 
  a lot more , to be precise - going to a pub is our national pastime . 
  w\u00f3dka is reserved for bigger events like weekend . 
  football is extremely popular . 
  but every pole is also a specialist in ski jumping , f1 and several other sports . 
  speedway is also huge in poland , but limited to few cities that suck in football . 
  we like singing . 
  and we usually sing songs about shooting to [ russians ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqzwm77obpi ) , [ germans ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ww1vwv_1c ) and living on a [ ukrainian steppe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vspg5iaz920 ) . 
  malta is that boy with a bucket . 
  two master 's represent !, 
  getting master 's in poland is a no-brainer , everyone does so . 
  thailand 's is at less than 1 % . 
  lower taxes and diffrent attitude - the first thing you think about when you go into a shop or restaurant in asia is `` over-employment '' . 
  we read it in highschool ... 
  because no one watches it in poland . 
  i 'm not even sure if any television is transmitting it . 
  but opposition in russia does n't use bmps and rpgs . 
  her name is flinta * . 
  and she 's a [ beauty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2wqigs1.png ) . 
  * which means a rifle in ( archaic ) polish . 
  from english `` flint '' . 
  edit : she 's also a coward . 
  she ran away from a chicken . 
  and a terrier . 
  and she barks at a postman and then wants to play with him . 
  i really miss her , fortunately until i come back home ( in august ) , we have a 13 years old german shepherd in malaysia ( she was guarding slovak embassy but when they closed up , my friend took care of her ) , so she keeps me company . 
  you 're so cute . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c4uteeojlm ) . 
  we do it all the time after parties and on vacation . 
  i 've slept with dozens guys and gals not having any intercourse with them - just sharing beds . 
  did n't see anyone having any problem with this . 
  people tend to live longer . 
   denmark - no common history false , piast dynasty 's women were sent to their kings . 
  jesus is the most important figure in the history of europe . 
  the same way how columbus and vespucci are one of the most important figures in the history of both americas . 
  imo / u/bobdole3 list is quite good . 
  but i would replace position no 3 . with marx/lenin . 
  the biggest part of our armored force are german leopards , so the gap is not that big at all . 
  germans have got newer ones , but we have more tanks - heer is going to have 225 leopard 2a6 , wojsko polskie - 232 pt-91 twardy ( polish modernization of t-72 ) , 142 leopard 2a4 and 105 leopard 2a5 . 
  so we 've got over two times more tanks - a bit dated , but a lot more . 
  http://www.astrapoland.eu/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=104&amp;itemid=205&amp;lang=en < - bam !, 
  they 've got also honey powder . 
  we have electronic voting in poland and last time this has happened in sejm was 11 years ago . 
  and those , who did it , were prosecuted . 
  but it 's cheaper than slovakia . 
  i have similar situation - i 'll probably go to church on sunday ... 
  but apart from that , i 'm staying alone in a huge building ( everyone left , i 'm staying with dog ) in a muslim country in se-asia . 
  pretty shitty place to spend easter . 
  south korea and mexico are not that random - both are quite populous and they have big economies . 
  they do have . 
  but there is probably no regionalized data from those countries . 
  also - dividing tiny lithuania , which is as populous as one poland 's voievodship does n't make any sense . 
  i have it in a chain-store next to me in malaysia . 
  :p i suppose there will be places in warsaw , that sell belvedere , mate . 
  it 's the same in poland .
