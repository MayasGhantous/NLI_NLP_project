  for months most upvoted comments on major polish news sites ( internet tabliods ) are pro-russian and anti-ukraine . 
  i understand anti-upa sentiment but those opinions are mostly out of proportion . 
  and in opinon polls , most poles support maidan . 
  and it still does n't matter at all , it was over 200 years ago , while ussr ceased to exist not even 25 years ago . 
  he might be from eastern slovakia - basically all slovaks know czech , if he lived near polish border , he most likely at least understands polish well . 
  as for russian - he might have learned it at school . 
   \u0421\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0438 ( sutki ) in russian nipples in polish . 
   para in lithuanian steam or pair in polish . 
  it 's the same in polish - stryj/stryjenka and wuj ( wujek ) / ciotka ( ciocia ) . 
  although , we do n't use the first two , wujek and ciocia is far more common and you can call your father 's family this way too ( an driends of your parents too ) . 
  in case of poland , it 's our own gas . 
  we do n't buy gas from norway . 
  baltics , belarus , central asia , moldova , caucasus . 
  [ usa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_american ) ... 
  okay , that 's a joke . 
  but all the rest are probably . 
  basically , every post-soviet state . 
  i would love to see more integration between visegrad countries . 
  we have similar experiences and understand each other better than guys from west of us . 
  article 5 does n't say that it has to be a military involvment . 
  deep cooperation between v4 countries would also be good for nato , because our armies would be better coordinated . 
  oh god , another one ... we can afford olympics , we do have most of infractructure and facilities ( those that we do n't have is planned either way , lots of due to 2022 ) . 
  historically olympics are hugely profitable ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cost_of_the_olympic_games ) - note that `` intangible costs ( such as to the environment and society ) and total benefits ( through tourism ) are not included here . '', 
  and even without tourism profits almost every olympics either broke even or were profitable . 
  as for facilities for niche sports - they will be used and we 'll have good sportsmen thanks to that . 
  without olympics we wo n't have a place where our bobsled team can train . 
  hopefully we 'll have one or two modern ice rinks after success of our representation in sochi . 
  you should provide , but you do n't have to . 
  he probably meant `` most effective '' . 
  but i do n't agree , those are signs of power slipping from his hands . 
  kurwa , that 's sick . 
  russian thugs ( some of them probably sent from russia , some of them former titushki ) beating protesters with rocks . 
  this is some biblical-martyr stuff , this should n't happen . 
  shame that milicja could n't do anything more , but they would be probably lynched on sight . 
  tell that to litvinenko . 
  i 'm 23 , i have my own studio apartment in a new block . 
  i 've currently rented it to some couple , because i 'm moving to kuala lumpur for few months and i would use some cash . 
  well , to be honest , that flat is n't mine , it belongs to my mum . 
  and i 'll have to leave it in 2-3 years , cause my brother will be moving there for uni . 
  if the situation will be tight , i 'll probably share it with him . 
  if i 'll have a good job , i probably will think about building a house ( however i doubt it will happen before i 'm 30 yo ) . 
  it is possible that i 'll move to other city ( warsaw ? ), 
  or country ( i 'm thinking hanoi ) . 
  i have a qustion , could you do an ama on / r/europe ? 
  work of independent journalist ( or a person that 's involved in journalism ) in russia is an interesting topic !, 
  he is really active in asia - not that long ago he visited arabian peninsula , he was visiting china and korea . 
  we have special agreements with the latter two . 
  okay , go read on chernobyl . 
  okay , i 've waited to comment . 
  as i do n't like sikorski for his attitude towards pis ( again : i 'm not supporting them , i just do n't like witchhunting ) , i like what he did regarind ukraine . 
  also , komorowski asian politics , ftw . 
  the worst part in chernobyl catastrophe was human/communisty idiocy . 
  okay , thanks . 
  :-d i usually think that any foreign student studies at ju , because it 's the biggest one ( and the best one too , duh ) . 
  it depends on a bus . 
  last time i was in a * some place in west , zielona g\u00f3ra maybe ? 
  * pks , they had wi-fi . 
  szwagropol does n't have wi-fi ( which is shame - they are probably the most expensive , but they have the largest fleet , so i usually use this line ) . 
  when were you a ju student ? 
  do you live in australia atm ? 
  ( no offence , i 'm going for an internship to malaysia and i would like to visit australia , so i would use some information from a local ) . 
   a group assing by speaking czech would probably trigger the `` polish '' bell in my brain [ czech original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et-nnvpxfky ) and [ polish cover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f8njkvbsj4 ) . 
  in the original there are parts in polish . 
  that 's because it 's about life before the war , when poles , czechs , germans and jews were neighbors . 
   slovak is the easiest to tell apart ( has a hungarian accent ) . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; okay , i might be able to say diffrence between slovak and czech , because i understand more from slovak . 
  the same goes for russian and ukrainian - ukrainian is more understandable to me , as a pole ( plus characteristic `` h '' instead of `` g '' ) . 
  i have no idea if i would identify belarussian . 
  and south slavic languages - they sound pretty similar to czech or slovak , but i would n't be able to tell , if someone speaks to me in serbian or croatian . 
  not to mention bulgarian and macedonian . 
  if it goes for germanic languages - german is an obvious one , i can tell if someone is from austria , bavaria , north or switzerland ( then i do n't understand a word when they 're speaking , it 's even more bizzare than australian english ) . 
  as for nynorsk , bokmal , danish and swedish - they sound the same . 
  oh , dutch is easy to recognise ( [ ffinshent fun hheuhhhh ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/nl-vincent_van_gogh.ogg ) ), 
  in two places you have something called `` zmiana sk\u0142adu '' ( since you 're polish , i wo n't try to describe it in english ) . 
  moreover , you first go to sucha beskidzka and after that to chab\u00f3wka - it is made this way , because the krak\u00f3w-zakopane line was an addition to vienna-krak\u00f3w line . 
  and they wanted to build it as cheap as it was possible . 
  this line was built in 1899 . 
  in hard conditions , sure , but this does n't mean that something called `` tunnel '' could n't been used . 
  in new `` zakopianka '' project , there are several tunnels . 
  unfortunately , there are no serious plans of modernization of krak\u00f3w-zakopane train line ( as i 've mentioned earlier - everyone uses buses , i do n't know one person from krak\u00f3w or zakopane that uses trains ) . 
  there were some ideas in 30s and then after the war , but there were no real political or economical pressure to do so . 
  eventually , it will be done ( 100km is n't that far ) , but roads are more important . 
  there were some , but it was all intended to be some sort of pretext for a conflict between communist states ( sino-sovie split and so on ) . 
  china may use a claim that outer manchuria ( now primorye ) was part of china . 
  there are also separatis tendencies in some regions of siberia . 
  i will be a very interesting region in the next 20 years and conflict over siberia will determine , if russia will stay one country . 
  weak russia does n't mean strong usa . 
  5 euros - good price . 
  10 euros - * rabble rabble !, 
  * krak\u00f3w-zakopane ; 4 euros and free wi-fi internet connection . 
  addin to what / u/arczi has written - buses between krak\u00f3w and zakopane ( places where i live ) are every 10 or 15 minutes ( sometimes even 5 minutes or two at the same time ) . 
  that 's mainly because rail between krak\u00f3w and zakopane is shitty and idiotic ( has been built aroun 100 years ago , so that 's not a surprise ) . 
   china doesnt really care beyond own interests and they want weak russia , for their own good . 
   putting a bullet through their head is n't a great place to start . 
  but that 's what they did . 
  killed independtent inteligentsia . 
  and resulted in positive economic effects , while our governments killed people and destroyed economy . 
  exactly . 
  cetnral europe ( except for hungary , maybe ) is already very determined to divesify . 
  the problem is that western europe relies on german gas , especially germany , too much .
