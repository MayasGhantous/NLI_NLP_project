   against stalin 's will , though . 
  raping and killing anyone in your path is a horrible way of spreading the message of communism and creating a sphere of influence . 
  it does n't solve any problems . 
  neither does genocide . 
  and , as far as we know , stalin was n't hesitant to decide to kill hundreds of thousand innocent people during his reign . 
  you 're one of them , anti-thatcher club , are n't you ? 
  i 've never heard anyone to say a bad word on thatcher ( nor reagan , to be exact ) in poland . 
  you did not say ( write ? ), 
  that this person is supposed to be alive . 
  and the ambassador in warsaw is kim pyong il , brother of late kim jong il . 
  moreover , poland has a joint-venture company with nk : [ chopol ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/chopol ) . 
  margaret thatcher . 
  i know that left in europe does n't like her , but she had guts to do difficult reforms . 
  civic platform/platforma obywatelska promised reforms and did nothing . 
  they 've increased vat . 
  and now exice on alcohol ( hooray illegal booze from ukraine and moonshine !, 
  in polish we have both demonstracja and manifestacja . 
  1 ) results are known in russia before voting even starts . 
  2 ) american saying that meat is a luxury , give ma break !, 
  meat is a necessity , not a luxury . 
  vegetarian/vegan diet might be as nutricious as a normal diet , but it 's far more expensive in our part of the world ( e.g. 
  doufu is n't cheap ) . 
   should belong to germany , or perhaps poland no , it should not . 
  while i agree , that it would be best , if kaliningrad was n't part of rf , it certainly should n't be given any other country ( especially germany ) . 
  free koeningsberg/kr \u00f3lewiec would be a nice addendum to the map of europe . 
  as for it becoming part of poland - i do n't want to have a sizeable russian minority in my country ... 
  only if you 're a dog . 
  i like my socks polish way - white , made in vietnam and as cheap as possible . 
  government wo n't tell me what socks should i wear !, 
  our forefathers fought , so we could wear cheap socks , without government interference !, 
  i like the hawaiian torch-ukrainian flag combo . 
  and * chris rea is looking for a wife * . 
  yep , it will be helfpul in fighting berktu . 
  can confirm , i 'm polish and wearing white socks with flip-flops at the moment . 
  germans might lack decisivness , because of their bussineses with russians . 
  if it were n't for nordstream , they would 've been more sure ally . 
  it 's not independent . 
  it 's a russian military base , nothing more . 
  this is nothing . 
  check out work of j\u00f3zef antonisz , like : [ jamniczek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r16gl3n4pdm ) . 
  there was a display of his films and tools he used to make them in national museum in krak\u00f3w last year . 
  thank you . 
  we would 've been much safer if it were n't for [ this ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrltwrn4gnhux56huqx_pt0ygzh3xoz8qwfmeh0jcfmqtq0eeow5q ) guy , our ex-premier , who was involved in so-called [ moscow loan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_loan ) . 
  we had signed an agreement with norway for a gas pipeline and he backed out from it . 
  some of them do . 
  it 's cheaper than petroleum . 
  petroleum is not a problem . 
  russians tried to blackmail poland in early 90s by `` shutting down the valve '' . 
  this does n't work , because importing petroleum in tankers is not a problem , there are other exporters , other than russia . 
  the problem is with gas - after blackmailing us in early 2000s , we 've managed to instal devises ( interconnectors ) that allow us to import gas not only from the east but also form west ( before that gas could only flow westward ) . 
  we have one of biggest reserves in europe ( for two months , if we do n't shut down biggest chemical plants in poland - if we decide to decrease industrial usage , we can last ** much ** longer , especially if we count in our own production , which can support poland for quite long time ) . 
  in few months our lng terminal will be finished . 
  so with gas - we have to build pipelines with interconnectors and lng terminals . 
  unless usa allows to export their shale gas . 
  or we stop listening to green groups ( financed by french companies interested in expanding nuclear power plants and russian government , which main interest is to maintain status quo ) and start seriously thinking about shale gas . 
  even more , we should start doing something with shale gas . 
  the nickleback bit is my favourite . 
  why is it even there , did you put nicklebackophobia in your constitution ? 
  it 's obvious that not every russian soldier in the penninsula is a member of spetznaz . 
  large part of them are guys that had been stationed in sevastopol before janukowycz 's ( yanukovych 's ? ), 
  impeachment . 
  okay , i did n't want it to be a meaningless dispute . 
  i just think that it is important to use proper terms . 
  although , a long-term change of food prices is possible only if the conflict will take more than few weeks . 
  we have almost half a year to harvest , so do n't panic ( i know that food markets do n't work in season cycles as they used too , but it is still an important factor ) . 
  no , he was n't . 
  franco in later period also was n't fascist ( you 're thinking falanga ) . 
  chile was an anti-thesis of fascism in terms of economy during pinochet . 
  and economy is the main thing that can be pointed as a diffrence between nazism and communism , leftist authoritarianism and rightist authoritharianism . 
  other things are usually only rethorics . 
  ( in case of ussr and iii reich - both countries are responsible for genocides , reason why they killed is not that important , killing is killing ) . 
  calling pinochet a fascist ... you probably just use it as label , pal . 
  pinochet was an authoritarian ruler , but not a fascist !, 
  if it was a warning shot , he did n't know how to do this . 
  i 'm not saying that he wanted to shoot anyone , i 'm saying that he didn ' y know how to use a gun . 
  http://youtu.be/x0iuogvlgcy?t=52s - < that was hardly a warning shot !, 
  he was shooting in their direction . 
  also - he does n't know how to shoot , nor how to hold a firearm , at all !, 
  that would be third lng terminal in former russian/soviet sphere of influence after polish lng terminal in \u015awinouj\u015bcie and the one croatians are building ( i know that yugoslavia was n't pro-ussr but soviets never stopped dreaming aobut controling balkans ) . 
  also that would mean the biggest stock market crash ever . 
  not to say bout big problems with wto and imf . 
  haha , right , it 's march already but i have n't switched yet . 
  my bad .

  [ oficial declaration ] ( http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/t1133558.shtml ) ______________________________ ** foreign ministry spokesperson qin gang 's remarks on the current situation in ukraine ** * 2014/03/02 * q : on march 1 , the russian federation council authorized russian president vladimir putin to use armed forces in order to protect russians and russian military officers and soldiers in ukraine . 
  what is china 's comment on the current situation in ukraine ? 
  a : china is deeply concerned about the current situation in ukraine . 
  we condemn the recent extreme and violent acts there and have been urging the relevant parties in ukraine to resolve their internal disputes peacefully within the legal framework so as to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of all ethnic communities in ukraine and restore normal social order at an early date . 
  it is china 's long-standing position not to interfere in others ' internal affairs . 
  we respect the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine . 
  there are reasons for why the situation in ukraine is what it is today . 
  china will follow the development of the situation closely and call on relevant parties to seek a political resolution of their differences through dialogue and negotiation based on respect for international law and norms governing international relations in order to uphold regional peace and stability . 
  so we 're p\u0105czki now ?
