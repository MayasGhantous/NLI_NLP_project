   although one of the last times poland and russia were allies as some sort of equals , it was against sweden . 
  when ? 
  sure , i was junst pin-pointing one of the greates mistakes of countries west of oder - you treated russia as a normal country , while you should think of it as if it was germany before the second world war ( yeltsin era was somewhat similar to weimar germany , now they have stron leader , who might not be an ideological nutjob , but he 's still very dangeorus ) . 
  as for military spendings , usa counts fors almost 50 % of world military spendings , so we 're safe in theory . 
  but west might not have guts to make some hard choices ( again , history of the interbellum comes to mind with munich ) . 
  poland and estonia are the only european nato members that are fulfilling 2 % requirements on military spendings . 
  and we 're spending more and more every year ( apart from the last budget - for the first time our military got less money than it was expected ) . 
   moscow has been involved in ukraine any more than we are aware of this is so typical for people from western europe . 
  russia controls most of politics of former ussr states . 
  the same was in poland 20 years ago ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_loan - leszek miller was later pm , now he'a again a leader of post-commie sld , however i think that his ties with russia has been cut long ago , frankly even post-commies are critical of russia in poland ) . 
  russia is n't a notmal state . 
  it 's run by former kgb . 
  in typical , kgbist ways . 
  you can not take his words for granted . 
  nothing has changed in russia since 1223 . 
  one of the most prominent polish politicians/economists , ex-deputy pm/president of central bank of poland , leszek balcerowicz , suggested great way to deal with it . 
  usa now forbids any exports of gas . 
  allowing that , even without embargo on russia , would hurt putin very much . 
  and if we embargo , it would let us hurt their economy even in longer term . 
  while killing more people than germans . 
  good for them !, 
  yeah ... 
  no , i did not . 
  i will try this year , if i manage to get there ( starting next month i 'll be in malaysia for 4 months , so there is a chance i 'll hop to vietnam ) . 
  and yeah , bugs are awesome . 
  i could eat crickets all day long . 
  i know that many of poles are highly critical of our late president ( so am i ) , but in situation like this , this kind of [ initiatvie ] ( http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/2061279/posts ) is needed . 
  this time not :  presidents and pms of lithuania , latvia , estonia and ** ukraine ** but :  presidents and pms of lithuania , latvia , estonia and ** georgia ** and maybe more countries . 
  i know , that margerashvili ( am i spelling his name right ) is n't as pro-west as saakashvili , he 's even considered somewhat pro-russian , but he did sign an agreement with the eu . 
  now is a time for bold moves . 
   i think you mean tactical drone strikes and tactical traditional air strikes for the big things ( since people freak the fuck out about drones ) . 
  yep . 
  shelling might have been wrong choice of words . 
  either way - indirect action in syria with concentration of troops in turkey . 
  as far as i know turkey is among most interested countries in this conflict ( besides poland and romania ) . 
  wow , that somehow makes sense . 
  if we 'll show ruskie we have balls , maybe they 'll consider two times before they 'll send more troops . 
  the best idea would be controlled shelling of assad 's forces with gathering some nato forces . 
  both ships and land forces ( in turkey ) . 
  well , they do , in vietnam . 
  i 've seen some skinned dogs in suburbs of hanoi few years ago . 
  i think that our government will do anything to keep ukrain intact . 
  [ the one in the middle ] ( https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrwzqukpkqcoio2km9ay7gr00sxve-ufr6potucghemirz3j0kp9q ) . 
  yeah , that was the second thing i 've checked . 
  cheers . 
  http://global.rakuten.com/en/store/kawachi/item/505571/ how about this ? 
  i think it will be cheaper ordering it from japan , than from poland . 
  yeah , but our gulasz does n't come cloes to true , hungarian gulyas - it 's basically something from another planet . 
  but i really enjoy langos during some festivals in krak\u00f3w ( which happen do be a weekly thing - if you want some langos , come to ma\u0142y rynek , there are hungarian ladies making it , they sometimes go to zakopane , too ) . 
   the reason west did not `` liberate '' south ossetia was that the damn natives did not want `` freedom '' that comes with an american invasion . 
  i do not want crimea to go down the same path . 
  and eu can ensure that , not nato . 
  no , the reason was that no one will dare nato-russia conflict . 
  not in the name of s.ossetia or any other territory in the post-soviet sphere of influence . 
  not counting current nato members . 
  i 'm almost sure it 's a hoax . 
  there are no results for `` exotic meat poland '' in google apart from this article . 
  well , the same goes with bad w\u00f3dka - if you exhale before you take a sip , it will be easier to swallow . 
  vide : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3-diqr41yo, 
  wow , even belvedere . 
  some fancy w\u00f3dka !, 
  http://www.danmurphys.com.au/product/dm_905095/polmos-spirytus-rectified-spirit-95-500ml they even have spirytus in shops in japan ( and the price is similar to polish ) . 
  so you wo n't puke . 
  i am serious . 
  if you take into account the region called asia-pacific , where american influence is most visible , it was a peaceful time for them . 
  external pressure/searching for lebensraum were n't issues ? 
  and thank god that you did n't jsut say `` fuck it '' . 
  russians still have nuclear weapons , so do chinese . 
  omnipresence of the us guaranteed last 25 years of peace in europe and most of asia . 
  what ? 
  having 1/4 of nation killed in gas chambers or by shooting in the back of head ? 
  also , mexico . 
  and spain . 
  try ouzo with water as a bottom layer , it 's white as snow . 
  drink borjomi , support georgians !, 
  we 're also opening a [ lng terminal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awinouj%c5%9bcie_lng_terminal ) this year , so we 're sure we wo n't freeze to death next winter . 
  not according to polish law . 
  this still does n't make sense . 
  in poland you 're automatically added to an electoral list of your town after you get your id card . 
  after that , if you want to vote outside your constituency , you just have to declare so in the municipal office in the place you 're currently living . 
  five days before election . 
  because nowadays it 's not that hard to have modern , based on computers , electoral system ( however we still count votes traditional way ) . 
  am i the only one that thinks that deadline for registration to election register in most countries is idiotic ? 
  why poland needs only five days , when france needs almost half year ? 
  they 're chauvinist . 
  and associating stance like that with being a rightist is imo wrong - they 're clearly pro-ussr . 
  nationalism and it 's radical version , chauvinism , are `` third way '' . 
   ( this includes poland ) where ? 
  i live in krak\u00f3w and the only thing i see is new buildings beeing build , not a single of them is empty . 
  also , more and more of my friends own their own apartment , bought by their parent for them . 
   everybody could afford a home at prices from 2000 ( in relation to income ) . 
  the year 2000 ? 
  okay , let 's do math . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.wynagrodzenia.pl/files/raporty-pdf/wynagrodzenia_polakow_po_20_latach_transformacji.pdf ) avarage pay in the year 2000 was 1924 pln , in the year 2013 it was 3805 pln brutto . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://studente.pl/wroclaw/artykuly/9256/od-450-do-7300-zl-ewolucja-cen-polskich-mieszkan/ ) square meter in wroc\u0142aw costed 2 400 pln in the year 2 000 ( i take wroc\u0142aw , because warsaw is much above avarage , both in terms of costs of living and salaries ) , and according to [ this ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/ceny-mieszkan-listopad-2013-3007384.html ) 6 121 pln in the year 2013 . 
  and prices are dropping every year . 
  so for a 60 square meter flat one would have to spend almost 75 monthly salaries in the year 2000 . 
  last year it would be 97 salaries . 
  this is a big , negative change , in this you have a point . 
  but on the other hand : a ) price of square meter is dropping every year ( you can see it in one of the links i 've provided ) - which is unique on the world scale , i 've done a presentation on housing prices in east asia on an academic conference last year , so i have some perspective ; b ) i think that one thing that we miss is that there are now a lot more luxurious apartments on the market and they pull the avarage price up ( in krak\u00f3w avarage price for a square meter is 6 496 pln , but there are investments like angel wawel , where avarage price per square meter is 15 000 pln [ link ] ( http://krakow.gazeta.pl/krakow/1,35812,14157903,co_sie_buduje__luksusowy_angel_wawel_kolo_wawelu.html ) ) .
