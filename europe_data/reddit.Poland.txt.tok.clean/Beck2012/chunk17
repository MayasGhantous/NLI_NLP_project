  i think that it 's quite obvious , mate . 
  shoutout to mods : please , make new ukraine megathread !, 
  you 're wrong . 
  the diffrence is huge - religious/national groups in syria are quite exclusive , national selfidentification is second to religious/sectarian . 
  also , religious diffrences are one of biggest factor in civilizational diffrences , thus very diffrent view of the world ( and it 's far deeper than opinion on abortion ) . 
  yep , i was wrong : http://www.lesslethalafrica.com/rifle.html although :  these rounds will not cycle the action of the firearm ; the firearm must be manually cycled for each shot . 
  this provides safety benefits . 
  the delay , allows the shooter to take aim between shots and not to `` open up '' indiscriminately . 
  as with all less lethal ammunition , aim low . 
  syria :  of the syrian population , 74 % [ 1 ] were sunnis ( including sufis [ 2 ] ) , whereas 13 % were shias , either alawites ( 11.0 % ) , twelvers ( 1.0 % ) , ismailis ( 0.5 % ) , or zaydis ( 0.5 % ) . 
  [ 1 ] 3 % were druze , [ 1 ] while the remaining 10-12 % were christians . 
  [ 1 ] not all the sunnis are arabs . 
  most of the kurds , who make up 10 % of the population are officially sunni , as are the turkmens who encompass 3-5 % . 
  thus syria is at most 59-61 % sunni arab . 
  ukraine :  christians - 33.6 % eastern orthodox - 26.8 % catholic - 5.9 % protestants - 0.9 % jewish - 0.1 % other - 3.8 % no affiliation/not aware - 62.5 %, 
  what ? 
  you know , policemen ca n't take weapons as they choose , they were equiped with lethal weapons , with firearms . 
  you do n't give those things if you want just a crowd control . 
  you use it to kill . 
  nope . 
  it has to be a pneumatic weapon . 
   do n't read rt and / u/pretzpretz ftfy, 
  when they use snipers , they want to kill . 
  two meaningful tweets : https://twitter.com/prosiecki/status/436430109466435584/photo/1 https://twitter.com/sikorskiradek/status/436422009111986176/photo/1 ( by polish minister of external affairs ) one more picture : [ shooting with ak ] ( http://dcs-188-64-85-27.atmcdn.pl/scale/o2/tvn/web-content/m/p1/i/6d9c547cf146054a5a720606a7694467/ebe1fa16-9a15-11e3-a803-0025b511229e.jpg?type=1&amp;srcmode=4&amp;srcx=0/1&amp;srcy=0/1&amp;srcw=640&amp;srch=2000&amp;dstw=640&amp;dsth=2000 ), 
  look at korea in 1950s . 
  russians would leave it to the un , they know that it 's a lost cause when it comes to a fight . 
  it would end in un intervention . 
  south ossetia is recognized as a country by five members of un . 
  do the math . 
   in the wake of the 2008 south ossetia war , russia , nicaragua , venezuela , nauru and tuvalu recognised south ossetia 's independence . 
  south ossetia is a part of georgia , eot . 
  according to @euromaidanpr ,  20 proterstors have been killed during bloody february 18 at #euromaidan | pr news #ukraine #kyiv, 
  even if georgia is a martian country - russia was in the state of war with them . 
  and there is no doubt that moscow is in europe . 
  south ossetia is a part of georgia . 
  russia is supporting illegal , separatist government . 
   the council of europe includes the eurasian countries of russia and turkey , as well as armenia , azerbaijan , ** georgia ** , and cyprus . 
  they did it 7 years ago ... 
  [ what 's happening in kiev - life ] ( http://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tvn24.pl%2fmilicja-ruszyla-na-majdan-wladza-ogranicza-ruch-w-kijowie%2c399496%2cs.html ) - it 's a polish site , google translated . 
  looks awesome , i love escargots . 
  when they have frozen snails in lidl , i eat them for a dinner every day . 
  and it 's so simple and non-controversial , i 'm surprised it 's in this topic . 
  gnocchi with delicious , very salty white cheese . 
  the only thing that could be considered less out of place would be bread with butter ... 
  goose lard is great , that 's true !, 
  btw , hungarian cuisine is based on lard and cream . 
  which is nice , but it 's even more fat than polish cuisine !, 
  raw pork ? 
  you it that , if you want to get some salmonella . 
  except for good mett ( or somewhat processed one sold in poland called metka , which tastes similar and you can store it ) . 
  maybe it 's time to get out of your vegetarian closet ? 
  if you mean tora - well , those rules were pretty smart for jewish people ( and basically everyone living in that climate and without tehcnology we 've got right now - like refrigeration or modern agriculture , medicine , etc. ) . 
  clean cut makes sense - this way you can get rid of blood , which spoils pretty easily . 
  the thing is that the evloution of jewish faith known in the bible includes things like shechita , which is not biblical , it 's rabinic . 
  it was a brachylogy . 
  to be precise - last execution was in 1988 . 
  trynkiewicz 's death sentence was changed to 25 years thanks to mentioned amnesty ( not change of law , as i 've written before , although general rule that i 've mentioned is true ) of 1989 . 
  i can not agree . 
  i think that most of us ( poles ) think highly of [ polonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_diaspora ) , especially american polonia . 
  emmigration and our diaspora has ( and had ) a big influence on poland and polish history since 18th century ( ko\u015bciuszko !, 
  25 years ago death sentence was abolished and 25 years was the highest possible prison sentence ( in our system one may be sentenced to month-15 years , 25 years or life imprisonment ) . 
  so there was nothing a judge could do , because one of the fundaments of polish penal code is that if new law is more favorable for a convict , it shall be used . 
  about justice system : no , it 's not . 
  proceedings are too time consuming . 
  our penal law is okay , civil law too . 
  but administrative law is utterly idiotic . 
  it probably counts `` saksy '' - part-time jobs in germoney . 
  among european countries , i 'd say that italy , spain , france or croatia should be top leisure destination for poles . 
  yay , i was right : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/28/e1/d8/z14213416q,plany-wakacyjne-polakow.jpg, 
  i 've waited two moths for orange/tp . 
  after that , when i 've really needed the internet , i 've called a private operator and got my connection in few days ( maybe two ? 
  you forgot that after the personality change russia took krokodil and attacked poland with a rusty shiv . 
  yeah , matejko is the most obvious choice . 
  but i 'd add also [ wyspia\u0144ski ] ( http://hej-kto-polak.pl/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/wyspianski.jpg ) , [ beksi\u0144ski ] ( http://kopieobrazow.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/kopia_beksinski-11.jpg ) , [ che\u0142mo\u0144ski ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/chelmonskijozef.1881.czworka.jpg ) , [ kossak ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/kossak_wojciech_-_pi%c5%82sudski_on_horseback.jpg/493px-kossak_wojciech_-_pi%c5%82sudski_on_horseback.jpg ) and [ nikifor ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcq3klfmx3yfiaigzdulb4cr5b4yuvllhs95nqdswp1uzyju-ozs ) . 
  minority complex ? 
  unfortunately a lot of people here feel that way . 
  poland is pretty advanced in non-cash payments :  poland is the most advanced country in europe in paypass : there are more than 1 million taps in poland each month . 
  the success is thanks to high number of cards , acceptance locations as well as tap & get promotions and cashless contactless festivals . 
  source : http://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/paypass-fact-sheet-10-10-121.pdf, 
  yeah . 
  there is a diffrence in pronounciation in : `` drzewo '' ( you say both `` d '' and `` rz '' ) , `` d\u017cem '' ( you say `` d\u017c '' like `` j '' in `` jam '' ) and `` przemek '' ( `` psh '' ) . 
  here 's an [ example ] ( http://www.ivona.com/pl/?tk=frdeksu1nm ) . 
  if you have `` rz '' and a hard consonant befor it ( like `` d '' or `` b '' ) it will sound diffrently than `` rz '' with a soft consonant ( `` t '' , `` p '' ) . 
  -  i 'm stupud and i make wrong decisions . 
  -  i 'm stupid and i 've made wrong decision . 
   2 ) bad toilets , hole in ground ( eastern toilets maybe in eastern europe , like turkey ) . 
  ( they are prevalent in asia , though ) in europe it 's probably campsite thing - i saw some in italy and croatia . 
  as for asia - after some time you feel lucky if you find a hole in a ground . 
  once , i 've encountered a hole in wall . 
  it was in vietnam , a concrete `` toilet '' with huuuge tank filled with water and a bucket . 
  you were supposed to use the bucket to move * those things * through a hole in wall . 
  and paying with credit card - it 's not a problem in poland , at least not in a city . 
  sure , if you 're in a desolate place where is only one little shop , you should n't expect them to accept your card ( but it also sometimes happen ) . 
  the same is in poland . 
  in fact , we have rich tradition of helping endangered species . 
   the protection of the european bison has a long history ; between the 15th and 18th century those in the forest of bia\u0142owie\u017ca were protected and their diet supplemented . 
  [ 21 ] efforts to restore this species to the wild began in 1929 , with the establishment of the bison restitution centre at bia\u0142owie\u017ca , poland . 
  some species would n't survive if people did n't control their population . 
  imagine large pack of wolves near human settlements , people would try to eradicate them , because they might be dangerous to stock and children . 
  the same goes with an occurance of a dangerous diseases , people have to shoot sick animals , so the disease wo n't spread further ( there was a situation like that with wisents in south-eastern poland ) .
