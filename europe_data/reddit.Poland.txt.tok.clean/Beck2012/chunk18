  and after reading this article i may only say that it 's idiotic and wo n't change anything . 
  hunting in europe is highly restricted , there are hardly any birds that might be hunted legally . 
  everything in this article show that the problem is not licensed gunters but poachers . 
  and corruption . 
  hell , if poachers were able to shoot virtually everything and the officials did nothing about it , mass-revoking hunting licences wo n't change a thing . 
  i 'd go further and say that it will only worsen the situation . 
  i ca n't imagine how changing the law in this particular case will change the attitude of police . 
  before you were n't supposed to shoot an eagle . 
  now it 's the same . 
  before , nothing really happened , if you shot an eagle . 
  now - we do n't know yet but i do n't see a single reason why would that change . 
  but it wo n't happen . 
  most of people use `` ogonki '' and now with things like swype it 's easier to write correctly . 
  that was a problem with numpad telephones , when we had to click all the way to '' \u0105 '' , when `` a '' wasa just one click . 
  also , we came across another diffrence - in russian there is only polish '' \u0142 '' , there is no polish `` l '' . 
  well , we 've used latin alphabet for last 1 000 years . 
  there'e that . 
  also , everything makes complete sense in polish . 
  to be honest , reading in polish is far easier than in english , not to mention french . 
  writing '' \u0105 '' is n't hard at all . 
  and there is no such sound in cyrillic alphabet . 
  in other words , what are you writing about , willis ? 
  that would n't make any sense , even if it was possible . 
  we have more sounds than russians . 
  also , why would anyone change their alphabet from latin , when it 's the most common in the world ( even children in china learn pinyin - even before they learn characters ) . 
  it 's like chinese spelling of `` r '' -  http://youtu.be/kdxuqecjjzk?t=3m19s disclaimer : pinyin `` r '' might sound like english `` r '' or polish `` rz '' . 
  screw all that . 
  there is only one important news !, 
  we 've won gold medal in ski-jumping !, 
  kamil stoch !, 
  and it was [ fenomenal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxjehthga_u ) . 
  two more golds in ski-jumping and we can go home as victors . 
  http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/12552#.uvdcspl5o4i here you are . 
  panorama ? 
  the same one that said before euro 2012 that our national sport is beating blacks ? 
  [ good scene ] ( http://youtu.be/k61ehndpuem?t=1m12s ) - and pretty easy to understand . 
  nah , it 's funny but outdated . 
  although i think that it 's worth mentioning !, 
  also , for inter-war poland : [ vabank ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju-fvknlsg8 ) and for poles during ww2 : [ katy\u0144 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bsc8roking ) . 
   krakow does n't have any good slopes i 'm from [ zakopane ] ( http://ohkrakow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/zakopane.jpg ) , which is 100 km from krak\u00f3w , where i currently live . 
  we have slopes . 
  and other facilities , like ski-jump . 
  well , not necessarily . 
  there are a lot of pros - krak\u00f3w and podhale will get money for infrastructural investments ( metro/subway , zakopianka - road that links zakopane and krak\u00f3w , highway bypass of krak\u00f3w , i hope also for a north-south highway in slovakia , because there is none and because of that it takes two times longer to go to budapest or bratislava than it should ) . 
  lot of facilities are done or are being build at the moment ( krak\u00f3w arena , which is right next to my apartment ) . 
  also , promotion . 
  and we need promotion - krak\u00f3w and zakopane are already quite popular but getting more attention would be nice and profitable . 
  look at barcelona or seoul , how those cities gained by organizing olimpics . 
  we have enough money to do this , so let 's do it . 
  probably not khrushchev , he was pretty simple-mided ^ ^ ^ dumbass . 
  yeah , deism is a term one might use . 
  but the last statement is a bit shocking to me . 
  i know some deists , very few atheists but majority of people i know are christians - mainly roman catholics . 
  you live in warsaw , right ? 
  yes , you 're right . 
  however , you can not support abiogenesis and not be an evolutionist too . 
  i 'm a member of polish creationist society . 
  yeah , that 's not a big topic here - in evangelist creationism terms . 
  but `` pure evolutionism '' ( no intelligent project whatsoever ) is n't the most popualr belief - most of people think that god ( or some other higher beeing ) created life on earth . 
  thus - they are creationists . 
  the question should be - is mainstream evolutionism a thing . 
  then we can answer , yes , it is . 
  it is taught in schools . 
  but also saying that it was done in the fashion decided by god would n't bring a mockery on you . 
  why am i a member of creationist organization ? 
  i get magazines for free . 
  :-d also , i do n't know how the life was created ( i think it was created !, 
  ) , so i search for answers . 
  darwinism is so popular that finding sources on this theory is not so hard , but if i want to read anything else , i have to put some effort in it . 
  well , reddit is becoming more and more popular in poland . 
  also , i do n't recall any links to that on / r/poland ... 
  i think that this might be a trend - most of poles in their twenties speak english and use anglophone sites - i think that the fact , that there are more redditors from poland , than from , e.g. , france , in this particular subreddit , should n't be that big surprise . 
  also , auto/self-identification as europeans in poland is far more common than in the uk . 
  even gas stations are closed ? 
  * holiday-that-you 've - forgotten-about ** routine is a gas station , hot dogs and beer . 
  i 've said it in the same time as in video ( well , i 've said `` oh fuck '' ) . 
  damn you , english , now i ca n't say `` kurwa '' when i 'm surprised . 
  what exchange program did you enroll on ? 
   ** laos ** visa not required : * luxembourg * visa required : * all others * i wonder if laotian visa-free programme is only for countries that first letter in their name is `` l '' . 
  but it 's super easy to get a visa - my mum and younger brother just got visas . 
  the only problem is that it 's quite costly . 
  brewdog is one of the most popular breweries i know ( among beer lovers ) . 
  also , i recommend imperial ipa 's , they 're usually very good . 
  still , this is n't that much . 
  my apartment 's price was about 100k usd and it 's 34 sq m . in poland , where wages are far lower than in sweden . 
  it happened in 1943-44 . 
  i admit that 2nd commonealth/republic policy regarding ukrainians was wrong - but there were no mass killings or extreme persecusions . 
  saying that `` germans and the soviets managed to outstrip everybody in their dark deeds '' is nothing more than a revisionism . 
  i simply do n't understand appreciation of bandera . 
  volhynia massacre was one of the biggest ethnic cleansings on polish population in history : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vlh0paqfie nsfw, 
   pschek if you 're ethnically polish , why you call me a pshek ? 
  it 's highly offensive . 
  i 'm not your dude , buddy !, 
  that would be the best option . 
  hot news !, 
  [ yanukovych went on to release . 
  rumors of a nervous breakdown ] ( http://translate.google.pl/translate?hl=pl&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tvn24.pl%2fjanukowycz-poszedl-na-zwolnienie-plotki-o-zalamaniu-nerwowym%2c392772%2cs.html ) !, 
  but portugal maintained control of macao for 2 years longer than uk of hk . 
  also , portugese colonial empire was last to dissolve , in 1970s . 
  oh , it 's part of your country 's history , you do n't know what happened ?
