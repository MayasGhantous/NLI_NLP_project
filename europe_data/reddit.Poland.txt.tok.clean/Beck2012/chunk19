  in 1997 uk gave hk back to china ( with parts that belonged to uk - because kowloon was leased to britain fo 99 years ) . 
  in 1999 the same happened with portugese macao . 
  so there was no agression , nor physical confrontation . 
  the same would happen with goa or diu ( author of this thraed forgot about this chunk of indian land that was ownede by portugal ) .

  in a poll in this article almost 60 % of readers declared that they now support ukrainian government , not opposition . 
  and i have to say , that my enthusiasm is gone . 
  i prefer putin 's russia to banderist ukraine . 
  edit : okay , i 've foung also an interview with this man . 
  it 's from one of the biggest and best polish daily newspapers : [ rzeczpospolita ] ( http://translate.google.pl/translate?hl=pl&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rp.pl%2fartykul%2f107684%2c1083009-lider-banderowcow--ludobojstwo-na-wolyniu-to-brednia.html ) my favourite part ( googletranslate translation ) :  q : ukraine will not be safe , balancing between russia and western europe . 
   a : therefore , we must recover nuclear weapons . 
  we in ukraine 's own experts , who to this lead . 
  think about macao and hong kong . 
  i 've added your subreddit to the sidebar of / r/askeurope, 
  at least one of us - [ twardowski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_twardowski )  twardowski was eventually tricked by the devil and caught not in the city , but at an inn called rzym ( rome in polish ) . 
  [ 1 ] while being spirited away , twardowski started to pray to the virgin mary , who made the devil drop his victim midway to hell . 
  [ 1 ] ** twardowski fell on the moon where he lives to this day ** . 
  his only companion is his sidekick whom he once turned into a spider ; from time to time twardowski lets the spider descend to earth on a thread and bring him news from the world below . 
   * what are some of the stereotypes of your country 's states , regions , etcetera ? 
  piersi\u0105tka in polish . 
  which sounds silly , but in polish , we can make a dimuntive of any word . 
  and in diffrent ways ( i imagine one may also say `` piersiunie '' or even `` piersiunieczki '' ) . 
  either way , `` cycuszki '' ( `` titties '' ) sound better . 
  or `` cycusie '' . 
  and you do n't know how to read a chart , mate . 
  also , you 're rude cunt , you know ? 
  this chart is from 1987 to 2014 . 
  i still have a ticket from a match when poland kicked netherland 's butts !, 
  that was exciting . 
  i really like rugby , but it 's not very popular in poland . 
  and my local team ( juvenia krak\u00f3w ) is n't that good either . 
  but that 's mainly because of lack of money . 
   ** the ** ukraine economy is very very good . 
  [ yeah , fckn awesome ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/ukraine-gdp-per-capita-ppp.png?s=ukrnygdppcapppcd&amp;d1=19870101&amp;d2=20141231 ) ... 
  well , he was a terorist . 
  he was convicted for involvment in killing of minister of interior bronis\u0142aw pieracki - it was done on his order . 
  bandera will be the main problem in polish-ukrainian relations . 
  fun fact - those that live on the west of the partition border are mainly from territories that now belong to belarus , lithuania and ukraine . 
  she was german ... 
  either way - the line lies on the eastern border of the commonwealth . 
  krak\u00f3w : you should go to a pub and talk with your friends . 
  i wonder what else will they occupy before tuesday and how will verkhovna rada 's session look like . 
  and vaclav havel with his velvet revolution . 
  i think that the congress of slavophiles in prague might have been mentioned . 
  also , battle of white mountain , the `` winter king '' . 
  episodes from 30-years war .

  [ the ukrainian revolt - dark red indicates district government building taken over by protesters , light red - being blocked/stormed [ 604x448 ] ] ( http://cs7004.vk.me/c540106/v540106258/c9c9/tnx5ikarxxg.jpg ) < - from / r/mapporn [ post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1w07cc/the_ukrainian_revolt_dark_red_indicates_district/ ) . 
  also , it was proposed in some of euromaidan threads , not in a protest thread . 
  making a political stance by a sub-reddit would be a bad idea ( but also would n't mean anything ) . 
  we are just showing our support to a nation that is in a deep crisis , that 's all . 
  it does n't say `` bandu het '' , so chill . 
  heh , that 's nothing new : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_of_reconciliation_of_the_polish_bishops_to_the_german_bishops, 
  the logo does n't contain anything that anyone could affiliate only with opposition . 
  it shows support for ukrainians , not support of euromaidan . 
  unless , you are saying that current government is not ukrainian . 
  but seriously , this guy is a foreign reporter , they wo n't do anything to him as long as he 's not breaking the law . 
  i 'm sure that he would be put in jail if he showed with helmet . 
   wear the bloody helmet !, 
  it 's illegal . 
  police could arrest him for wearing a helmet . 
  that 's a cross-post from / r/wtf . 
  well , i think that there is no doubt what is going on there . 
  government is fighting the nation . 
   on 19 february 1954 , the presidium of the supreme soviet of the soviet union issued a decree transferring the crimean oblast from the rsfsr to the ukrainian ssr . 
   the ethnic makeup was comprised the following self-reported groups : russians : 58.32 % ; ukrainians : 24.32 % ; crimean tatars : 12.1 % ; belarusians : 1.44 % ; tatars : 0.54 % ; armenians : 0.43 % ; and jews : 0.22 % . 
  first - no need to downvote me for expressing my opinion . 
  second - the same way i can go and tell that lithuania , belarus and ukraine occupies parts of historically polish territories . 
  the thing is that borders change and just because before 2nd world war majority of lviv 's or vilnus population was polish , does n't mean that we should claim that those territories are occupied . 
  no , we lost them because of stalin , the same way germans lost stettin , which is now szczecin . 
  things like that happen . 
  i like the `` yanuchesko '' witz , i see what you did there . 
  however , he did get around 90 % of votes in donbas and around 80 % in crimea . 
  you know , i 'm not an expert on ukraine , especially eastern part of your country , but do n't you think this is a major issue ? 
  this and that , according to wiki , 3 on 10 people in donbas do n't consider themselves ukrainians ? 
  and some of them retain soviet identity ? 
  in 1987 no one had dreamed that some day there will be no soviet union . 
  we can not be sure that things wo n't go nasty . 
  also , about this apolitical stance of post-soviet armies or generaly about stability of political power ... 
  remember yanayev and band of eight ? 
  remember constitutional crisis of 1993 ? 
  that was n't that long ago , 20 + years . 
  sure , it wo n't happen in russia but ukraine is as vulnerable now as russia was in early 90s . 
  ukraine 's gdp per capita ( ppp ) is lower than in 1990 , according to [tradingeconomics.com ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/ukraine-gdp-per-capita-ppp.png?s=ukrnygdppcapppcd&amp;d1=19900101&amp;d2=20141231 ) ... 
  look at yugoslavia . 
  croatian and serbian are basically the same language ( i even had a polish-serbocroatian dictionary ) . 
  sure , religious factor was deeper ( you have it too , in a lesser extent ) . 
  historical factors - still there ( western parts of ukraine belonged to the west up to 1939 , as territories of commonwealth , then austria , then poland ) . 
  as for kiev , well , it 's a capital , so pro-western sentiments are quite understandable . 
  the most anti-putin area in russia is probably moscow ( or , at least , it 's somewhere in the top of the list ) . 
  also , as i recall , crimea and donbass region were given to ukraine by russia few decades ago , were n't they ? 
  i do n't want to be a fearmonger but ukraine does have some demographic issues that might be a big problem in the future . 
  ukrainian politicians did n't do enough to create a sense of national community between ukrainian citizens . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
   civil war requires at least two opposing sides having different view on the future of a country . 
  ( ... ) there is nothing like this in ukraine . 
  well , you 're wrong .
