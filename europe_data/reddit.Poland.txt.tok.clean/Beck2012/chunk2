  it 's expected to grow to 20 % , due to rapid private reforestation . 
  yeah , but if russians will sue their nukes , they 're going to hit us first ( 25 years ago usa would do that to us ) . 
  but yeah , it 's helluva better to be back among the western countries . 
  find a buyer and sell it to him/her . 
  if you own a forest , you can sell it . 
   moreover , maybe aside from some highlanders/g \u00f3rals ( which usually do it to promote region , aka earn money for ` photos with highlanders ' ) no , it 's used as a suit by them . 
  source : i 'm from zakopane and half kids on their first communion were dressed in cucha . 
   and , when using costume as a sign of my origin , would hanbok ( female ) in cracow/warsaw or oslo/bergen/rotterdam look really weird ? 
  yes . 
  but if i went out in [ our traditional dress ] ( http://www.ekomod.pl/files/07[1].jpg ) , i 'd also look silly . 
  that is being forced upon us . 
  my grandpa has sold a forest in zakopane - he bought himself pair of gloves and a coat for my grandma . 
  he lsot his gloves on the next day . 
  my father mentioned that when he was kid , he and his friends used to make fake queues . 
  they were standing in front of a closed shop and people just were forming a queue behind them , without asking * what are they standing for * ... 
  i 've read about it . 
  it was mainly for [ * zeks * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_sea%e2%80%93baltic_canal#commemoration ) and members of the commie party that supported * wrong cause * , was n't it ? 
  [ death penalty for alleged economic crimes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis%c5%82aw_wawrzecki ) - stealing meat . 
  killing partisans like [ inka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danuta_siedzik%c3%b3wna ) . 
   she was charged with taking an active , violent part in an attack on functionaries of the communist ub ( polish secret police ) and the milicja obywatelska near village podjazy as part of the \u0141upaszko unit , despite the fact that ** she was only a medic ** . 
  she was accused of shooting at policemen and even issuing orders to other partisans . 
  however , the testimony submitted by mo and ub members involved in the fight was at best contradictory , as some claimed to have seen her shooting and giving orders , while other denied it altogether . 
  one , named mieczys\u0142aw mazur , testified that siedzik\u00f3wna had given him first aid after he was wounded by other partisans . 
  [ 2 ] she was charged with killing wounded policemen , a charge contradicted during her trial . 
  the court decided she had not played a direct part in the attack . 
  [ citation needed ]  ** despite this and siedzik\u00f3wna age ( 17 ) , the court still sentenced her to death . 
  ** the president of people 's republic of poland , boleslaw bierut refused to grant her clemency ( the request was submitted by siedzik\u00f3wna 's public defender , which the prisoner herself refused to sign ) . 
  siedzik\u00f3wna was executed ( along with feliks selmanowicz , whose nom de guerre was `` zago\u0144czyk '' ) , six days before her 18th birthday , on 28 august 1946 , in a gda\u0144sk prison . 
  her statue in krak\u00f3w is very often defiled by some mindless idiots . 
  okay , but setting this very grim side of the communist regime , there were some good things . 
  movies from those times are pretty great , we had some athletic successes too . 
  and it was better to live in poland , than in romania or ussr ( that thing did n't change , i think - sorry guys ) . 
  70s were kind of peaceful . 
  but it 's hard to write about good things , when such atrocities as mentioned above happened . 
  except for mercedes ' . 
  mercedes ' is in albania . 
  rightly so , the same constructors . 
  yes , i hope that ukraine will be what poland is for germany now . 
  no , it 's not bad for them . 
  ukraine is a third country right now ( sorry guys , that 's a harsh truth , last 20 years were n't good for you ) . 
  but this is a great chance for them to progress . 
  were doing . 
  fun thing is that there are sometimes fights between koreans and japanese or chinese guys in front of clubs . 
  our dresy love it . 
  [ happened in front of `` ministerstwo '' in krak\u00f3w - dresy just chanted and were having a blast ] . 
  i know a lot of asians , mainly chinese and korean ( i 've worked in asia , i 'm studying far east regional studies ) , my friend has a japanese boyfriend , other girl i know has a koran husband . 
  never heard of any unusual problems or abnormal racism . 
  there are people that pick on others , but they will find a way to do so - if you 're not asian , you might wear glasses , have a backpack in wrong colour - you know what i mean , right ? 
  and ajwar !, 
  wesele without poprawiny is not a true wesele . 
  also , to / u/orthoxerox - if you expect people to drink all three alcohols , well , that would be a `` village wedding '' . 
  people should n't mix alcohols ( well , maybe with a small exception for a beer , it 's always good ) . 
  on a wedding , people should drink w\u00f3dka , period . 
  i think that pi\u0142sudski is the best source of shocking and hilarious statements . 
   - marshall , sir !, 
  what is this party ; s programme ? 
   - the most simple of them all . 
  beat whores and thieves , dear count . 
  no , that 's bullshit . 
  2 000 people ca n't be called `` high tatar population '' . 
  one of the most probably reasons is belarussian population , they have an mp in sld . 
  stop pulling answers from your ass and provide some sources , mate . 
  the second reason is cimoszewicz , who lives with \u017bubry in bia\u0142owieska . 
  yes . 
  and / u/problemy is wrong , in cities like szczecin there were almost no poles prior to 1945 , all of them were transported from kresy . 
  and source : http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2012/k_050_12.pdf 51 % of kresowiacy live in western poland . 
  if we count all ex-prussian areas , the number is 65 % . 
  and in lower silesia/opole 42 % people admit that they 've come from kresy , so they might not be a majority , but they 're a big part of the community . 
  and in conservative krak\u00f3w we have an ex-commie as a president . 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's displaced ( people were forcibly moved from kresy to ziemie odzyskane ) versus families tied to their local community . 
  and it was the same 60 years ago - the most anti-communist region was `` poorer and conservative '' ma\u0142opolskie , the only place , where commies did n't rig elections . 
   polish people know how to work without complaining oh no , we will complain a lot !, 
  but we will do the job . 
  do n't forget the us . 
  we love our american allies . 
  and you have the hottest goulasz , brother . 
  good for you guys !, 
  and so the south stream bill has been concealed . 
  i 've always wanted to live in montana . 
  now i know that it would n't affect my life expectancy !, 
  ninja edit : and we can outlive guys from mazowieckie !, 
  we do n't want to . 
  / o \\ we 're just very nostalgic . 
  the only cookbook i own is `` kuchnia lwowska '' , and i love lw\u00f3w - with it 's multiethnic history . 
  but now it 's a ukrainian city , with deep polish , armenian , jewish history . 
  my roots are there , so i consider it a polish city , not polish-owned city . 
   22:31 russia turns its clock to winter time , permanently russia has turned back its clocks to winter time and has reverted to the full 11 zones from kamchatka in the pacific to kaliningrad that were reduced to nine by the previous president , dmitry medvedev . 
  in july , russia 's president vladimir putin signed a law bringing back winter time but canceled the summer time shift . 
  http://rt.com/news/line/2014-10-25/#73472 i love comment made by @natosource ( * daily news of the world 's most powerful alliance . 
  not affiliated with the north atlantic treaty organization . 
  * ) on twitter :  symbolism ? 
  [ kurwa , my field ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvrsdiofdza ) . 
  well , he lacks skills . 
  we have people that can open a beer bottle with everything : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4_ncki4dtg, 
  something between mozzarella and twar\u00f3g . 
  all of them are made from sheep milk . 
  in 1350 the city was destroyed . 
  in 1356 it was located and rebuilt by casimir iii the great , king of poland . 
  i remember when one kid in my class did n't bring a book to school , because he could n't fit both the book and pack of crisps .
