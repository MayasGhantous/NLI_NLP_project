  we have huge cultural and linguistic split in ukraine between west and east . 
  the first thing that came to my head when i heard about it this morning was [ `` ballada o janku wi\u015bniewskim '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16k4fygqpwu ) ( [ other version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jadid9h5o6w ) by krystyna janda , she performed it at the end of classic andrzej wajda film from 1980 - [ man of iron ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man_of_iron ) , and [ newer version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw9vrnfl9no ) by kazik from a picture * black thursday * ) . 
  we had to wait for our freedom for next 19 years after the shooting of [ zbyszek godlewski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janek_wi%c5%9bniewski ) in the winter of 1970 . 
  here is a translation of lyrics : * boys from grab\u00f3wek , boys from chylonia * * today militia used arms * * bravely we stood , accurately we threw * * janek wi\u015bniewski fell * . 
  * on a door we carried him along \u015awi\u0119toja\u0144ska * * against the cops , against the tanks * * boys , shipyard workers , avenge your comrade * * janek wi\u015bniewski fell * . 
  * the bangers sound , the gas spreads * * blows fall on the workers * * children , elderly , women are falling * * janek wi\u015bniewski fell * . 
  * one is wounded , another killed * * blood was spilled at dawn in december * * it 's the party shooting at the workers * * janek wi\u015bniewski fell * . 
  * [ bloody kocio\u0142ek is the tricity 's executioner * * because of him the children , women are dying * * wait , you bastard , we 're going to get you * * janek wi\u015bniewski fell ] * . 
  * shipyard workers of gdynia , workers of gda\u0144sk * * go home , the battle is over * * the world learned about this , and said nothing * * janek wi\u015bniewski fell * . 
  * do n't cry mothers , it was n't for nothing * * there 's a black [ red ] ribbon above the shipyard * * for bread and freedom , and a new poland * * janek wi\u015bniewski fell * i hope that memory of this deaths will help you fight for your freedom . 
  and yet you believe a random guy on reddit that says that he 's just a russian goverment official and everything russia does is good . 
  he 's not suspicious at all , is n't it ? 
   magnitogorsk was mentioned in the blacksmith institute 's 2006 survey of the world 's worst polluted cities , placed in the report 's unranked list of the 25 most polluted places outside the top ten . 
  pollutants include lead , sulfur dioxide , heavy metals and other air pollutants . 
  according to the local hospital , only 1 % of all children living in the city are in good health . 
  the blacksmith institute says that , according to a local newspaper report , `` only 28 % of infants born in 1992 were healthy , and only 27 % had healthy mothers . '', 
  solid reason is that ussr was a totalitarian state that killed millions of people and post-soviet nomenclature in russia is still the main power . 
  i would n't want to see an abwehra agent as a kanzler of germany ... 
  spot on . 
  so what , all italians should now speak polish or german ? 
  the same goes with german in poland . 
  almost everyone learns it at least 3 years in high school but hardly anyone knows this language . 
  that 's because german popular culture is not as popular as us/english . 
  and that 's germans fault ( good example - scorpions ) .

  poland [ hurt - za\u0142oga g ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tpy2x2wwyq ) - i really like it . 
  very nostalgic . 
  [ big cyc - ballada o smutnym skinie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gjxx7but5k ) - big tit - ballad of a sad skinhead . 
  big cyc is a very popular band in poland . 
  [ \u015awietliki - filandia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fco7wn7gz6m ) - band formed by one of the most successful young polish poets , \u015awietlicki . 
  in this song sings one of the most popular polish actors , bogus\u0142aw linda ( famous for beeing a [ badass ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjqx_5ep73c ) ) . 
  what argument ? 
  poles has statistically less children than brits and go to britain for work , not social benefits . 
  if they use them , that 's because they 're entitled to them , i doubt anyone moves to britain just to exploit social system ( moving to other country is quite expensive itself ) . 
  it has the same grammar as polish , so it can not be called a language . 
  plastic pipes too ? 
  no , putin 's not interested in power or restoring imperial position of russia whatsoever . 
  lvivskie !, 
  in polish it 's called chart . 
  krk is a river in croatia . 
  i thanked god for swedish signs when i was in helsinki , without them i 'd be lost in a moment . 
  and swedish is similar enough to german to decode anything from it . 
  in chinese there is a distinction between `` he '' and `` she '' only in written form . 
  you say `` t\u0101 '' but write \u4ed6 for man and \u5979 for woman . 
  in korean \uadf8\ub294 ( geuneun , where `` eu '' is a sound like `` e '' in `` gensek '' ) means `` he '' and \uadf8\ub140\ub294 ( geunyeoneun , where `` yeo '' sounds basically like `` yoh '' ) . 
  so there is a distinction even in spoken language . 
  i do n't know japanese , so i wo n't comment on this one . 
  no , no !, 
  i genuinely meant what you 've written as soviet relics . 
  it 's not just a dream . 
  it 's post communist shit they 're still in . 
  we are somehow managing but we had some advantages ( like mono-ethnic society , access to baltic , traditional anti-communism , bordering germany etc. ), 
  bulgaria or ukraine did n't have . 
  as i 've said many times before - i 'm sceptic but i know that some of the advantages of eu ( the most important ones are access to a big european market and focus on getting rid of corruption ) that are worth fighting for . 
  we did the same with statue of dzier\u017cy\u0144ski in 1989 : http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xb6vsb_20-lat-wiadomosci-tvp-zburzenie-pom_shortfilms, 
  hah , i imagine . 
  it 's very meaningful that protesters were called \u0432\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044b , vandals . 
  even if you do n't agree with them and this act - it was n't vandalism , it was a political manifestation . 
  wikipedia :  around the late 19th century there was also a limited number of polish voluntary settlers , attracted by the economical development of the region . 
  [ 5 ] polish migrants and exiles , many of whom were forbidden to move away from the region even after finishing serving their sentence , formed a vibrant polish minority there . 
  [ 5 ] hundreds of poles took part in the construction of the trans-siberian railway . 
  [ 5 ] the term sybiracy might also refer to former exiles , such as those who were allowed to return to russian-held poland following the amnesty of 1857 [ citation needed ] . 
  the group , popular among the youth in the period preceding the outbreak of the january uprising , supported the idea of organic work . 
  however , during the january uprising it ceased to exist as some of its members supported the reds , while others supported the whites . 
  among the most notable members of the group were agaton giller , henryk krajewski , karol ruprecht and szymon tokarzewski . 
  [ 6 ] there were about 20,000 poles living in siberia around 1860s . 
  [ 5 ] an unsuccessful uprising of polish political exiles in siberia broke out in 1866 . 
  [ 5 ]  at the start of world war ii , the soviets deported hundreds of thousands of polish citizens , most in four mass waves . 
  the accepted figure was over 1.5 million . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] the most conservative figures [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] use recently found nkvd documents showing 309,000 [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] to 381,220 . 
  [ 19 ] [ 20 ] the soviets did not recognise ethnic minorities as polish citizens , [ 18 ] [ 21 ] some of the figures are based on those given an amnesty rather than deported [ 8 ] [ 18 ] and not everyone was eligible for the amnesty [ 22 ] therefore the new figures are considered too low . 
  [ 16 ] [ 18 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] the polish institute of national remembrance now estimates of the number of people deported to siberia to be 320,000 . 
  [ 25 ] tens to hundreds of thousands of lithuanians , latvians and estonians were deported after the annexation of their states in 1939-1940 and german invasion of the soviet union ; [ 26 ] [ 27 ] many tatars or volga germans joined them just a few years later . 
  [ 28 ] others were exiled not because of their ethnicity but for belonging to a social group , such as the kulaks , rich peasants targeted by the soviet regime . 
  [ 29 ] tl ; dr - in tsarist russia you could serve your sentence and then live a fairly normal life . 
  in ussr you died in gulag . 
  in tsarist russia you ended on katorga because you were an insurgent or criminal . 
  in ussr you ended in gulag just because you were a pole . 
  do n't know if optimistic , or not . 
  and sure , there were many factors , but ultimately there had to be one victor . 
  imo one of the main reasons of bolshevik victory was arrogance of whites . 
  if they did n't use the rhetorics of great russia and agreed on sovereign poland and ukraine ( and maybe belarus ) , then joined forces of pi\u0142sudski and petlura might have helped them ( do n't know the stance of petlura on this but poland was eager to help denikin 's forces but his stubborness was a major obstacle ) . 
  lenin lied about the right of selfdetermination of nations , therefore he was viewed as a lesser threat . 
  also , i do n't unferstand why you 've been downvoted . 
  whoa , hold your horses , cowboy . 
  why so agro ? 
  i was simply asking a question . 
  really , you should calm down . 
  you do n't associate yourself with opposition ? 
  maybe using a white-red-white flag would be more appropriate to show your opinion on the sovietesque character of your government ? 
  anti-communism is the best qualification for dismantling lenin monuments . 
  yalta is probably the city that most poles hate the most in the world . 
   you think this did n't happen under the tsar ? 
  entire communities would be hanged . 
  according to our experience - nope . 
  when poles were sent to sibir in 19th century , they were explorers , scholars and enterpreneurs . 
  they were fighting against tsar but he did n't order mass-murders , he sent them to gain profit for the empire . 
  when poles were sent by bolsheviks to sibir , they were prisoners in gulags , acting more like an animal than man , whinking only about survival . 
  there was a civilizational gap between tsarist russia and bolshevik russia . 
  bolsheviks were just a small fraction - lady fortuna was probably fond of them , because numbers were against them .
