  also , it 's not a fight against russia or russians - bolsheviks were not only russians but also georgians , poles , ukrainians and so on . 
  it 's a fight for historical truth about atrocities done by one of the most brutal regimes in the history of mankind . 
  poles were one of the biggest victims of it but the biggest one were russians themselves . 
  i am not a rusophobe - i enjoy russian poetry ( bukovsky for instance ) , literature and music . 
  i love reading victor suvorov . 
  i also understand politics of kremlin ( as well as politics of berlin , beijing or teheran ) but i do n't think that it 's course is beneficial to my country and my nation - we are , because of history and geo-politics , rivals . 
  that wo n't change as long as russia is the biggest country in the world and in order to maintain its territorial integrity has to show it 's powerful and confident in its strength . 
  the same situation was in bolshevik camps . 
  and revenge is not an excuse . 
  yeah , but that was something diffrent . 
  both sides had pows . 
  and during that time they 've died of epidemics which were common even among free people , not prisoners . 
  they were n't killed by poles because they were russians , they 've died as pow after the war , because the other side also held prisoners and the situation ( mainly hygiene and medical support ) in this kind of camps was bad . 
  i 'm sure they do . 
  i remember this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_ ( 1937 % e2 % 80 % 931938 ), 
  my great-grandfather had to flee from lw\u00f3w in 1939 to zakopane , because he feared colsheviks . 
  he fought in 1919-1920 war against them and knew them well . 
  also , as a veteran of this war , he feared that he would be killed by them . 
  he returned to lw\u00f3w in 1941 , when germans attacked ussr . 
  [ ha-ha !, 
  yeah , sure . 
  and all germanic people sounded to us like damn mutes , you could n't even speak basic human ( = protoslavic ) . 
  niemcy is the proper way to call germany or germans . 
  szwaby is definetely a slur . 
  fryce would be another one . 
  and a german woman could be called `` niemra '' . 
  and how do you call us ? 
  we have slurs only on russians ( kacapy , moskale ) , jews ( parchy ) and germans ( szwaby ) . 
  sure , no problem . 
  i think you 'll be able to find foreign students from those unis online via some kind of forum , i think it 's best to ask them directly what they think about courses , cities , etc. 
  prague , krak\u00f3w or warsaw imo would be good choices . 
  decent universities , plenty of foreigners , everyone speaks english ( at least in poland ) and it 's really cheap . 
  try living in a totalitarian state . 
  the first thing that should happen is dimission of head of police and minister of internal affairs . 
  everyone knew that among the protesters will be some rioters ( they always come when there is a huge demonstration ) . 
  russian embassy was not secure - i remember how last year some people ( mostly right leaning commentators ) said that it was idiotic and irresponsible not to place police around government buildings . 
  everything was okay back then ( few cars destroyed but no attacks on buildings ) but this year this russian embassy thing happens . 
  it is a high risk place in this kind of situation and it has to be protected !, 
  also , only 30 000 euros in damage . 
  well , that 's not that much ... 
  we defeated russia 90 years ago . 
  also , we 're starting huge investments in military . 
  we 're even building our own [ light tank ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/czo%c5%82g_lekki_pl-01_%2802%29.jpg ) . 
  we 're also buying new submarines . 
  everyone in poland agrees that we have to build a strong army and that 's perhaps the only consensus that we 've achieved . 
  russians attacked georgia in 2007 , we have to be strong enough to be able to fight them when we 'll have to . 
   he 's from transylvania . 
  maybe all that is a step up ? 
  it would be a step up . 
  i 'm not a fan of our government ( and never will be with my freaky political views - i view myself as a libertarian-catholic-monarchist chap ) but ... poland is a nice place to live , especially if you 're young . 
  well educated society , nation with astonishing cities and pretty country side ... we 're making a huge progress - public debt is too high but in relation to gnp , however we 're doing quite good ( you can sustain a certain amount of debt if you 're getting richer - currently poland has got 18th biggest economy in the world [ gdp ppp acc . 
  to world bank ] ) . 
  unemployment is high , that 's true , but situation in spain or ? greece is far worse . 
  we have large population , resources and know-how . 
  in 20 year we 'll get to the level of germany . 
  next time you 'll be in poland try some of [ pinta ] ( http://www.browarpinta.pl/oferta/1-pinta-atak-chmielu-151deg ) beers . 
  love them , preety expensive for poland ( mainstream beer costs less than 1 u$ d , their beer costs around two euros ) but so damn tasty . 
  but i 'm in love with guiness and british ales . 
  or a good ipa ... 
  i lost my interest in lagers few months ago but in poland you can either drink a lager or very expensive imported beer ( or beer from pinta or other micro-brewery ) . 
  also : germany and beers like paulaner . 
  the worst beer is from hungary . 
  only chinese make worse beers than hungarians . 
  also : croatians have got worst bottled water ( it 's salty !, 
  [ relevant !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzk6dkafyiy ), 
  nope , we have a deficit . 
  and we always had , at least for two decades , i think . 
  and this year it is really big . 
  and current government made huge mess with our budget - employment in public sector increased and they 've spent loads of cash into infrastructure . 
  thanks to that our gdp steadily increased , however soon we 'll have to tighten our belts and be more fiscally responsible - it might have worked during recession ( other factors like cheap and educated labor also helped , as well as huge emigration ) but because of negative birth-to-death ratio ( people do n't want to have children now , according to world bank data it 's not that bad but domestic data say that we 'll have a demographic collapse ) we have to be prepared and have some savings .

  llamas are huge dicks . 
  they would probably kill you on the spot . 
  also , i thought of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw2lteb76fk, 
  and san marino is showed in vatican 's place ... also , tibet ? 
  seriously ? 
  lol , russia is surprise for you ? 
  have n't you heard about anna politkowska ? 
  you mean ananas , right ? 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2g_0pdsag4 slovakia : - do you eat dogs ? 
  - no , not in this village . 
  you can ask white 's mayor . 
  they eat dogs in < names villages  but not in letanovce . 
  - but we eat dogs - says a boy and gets smacked by father . 
  the thing is that roma does n't consider themselves part of the community , so they wo n't work with any government unless they 'll get something from it . 
  and they 'll lie all the time to white people . 
  i 've worked at a bailiff 's office this year and going to a gypsy village was one of the most traumatic things i 've encountered . 
  we have a poem . 
  :-) [ abecad\u0142o z pieca spad\u0142o ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf3yuyyutlo ) . 
  god , change lens . 
  god , cap guns were awesome . 
  far better than crappy air-softs ( i do n't mean good quality asg but those cheap shits that broke after a month ) . 
  there were some more unique , let 's say polish , things . 
  like old [ romet komar ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/romet_komar_2350_-2.jpg ) , [ simpson ] ( http://www.realclassic.co.uk/bikepix/simson07070201.jpg ) ( first motorbike i have ever drove , i was seven and a gate i ran into was quite hard ) , [ piszinger/andruty ] ( http://storage.doradcasmaku.pl/dynamic_image/a/a706/71b8/92dd/b75e/712a/4fee/3788/fd1e/w800_h600_ma_bffffff.jpg ) , [ elitesse ] ( http://www.auchandirect.pl/assets/ctx/2/static/img/product/popup/97100618.jpg ) ( they are still availible and still delicious ) . 
  the thing is that most of food that i remember from my childhood is still out there - both foreign ( nutella , magnum , snickers ) and local ( [ prince polo ] ( http://ambra.igk.pl/repository/product/prince%20polo%20classic_36g.jpg ) , [ princessa ] ( http://www.opinie.senior.pl/zdjecia/batony-i-wafelki/princessa-mleczna-40937-big.jpg ) , [ kr\u00f3wki ] ( http://www.niam.pl/rimages/crop/600/450/files/images/otsp/backup/otsp_1424_23831709913336255346817110887347.jpg ) , [ kuku\u0142ki ] ( http://www.opinie.senior.pl/zdjecia/cukierki-lizaki-drazetki/kukulki-7357-big.jpg ) ) , half of these things have been with us for decades . 
  even [ frugo ] ( http://www.bloblo.pl/image/272142/oryginal/frugo_sg.jpg ) which was veeery popular in 90s/00s came back after few years . 
  but it 's not as good as it used to be * . 
  one thing that i miss and is not availible in poland is [ milka magic stars ] ( http://www.livelife.pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/milky-way-magic-stars.jpg ) . 
  * there is a good polish song about it , [ filandia by \u015awietliki ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fco7wn7gz6m ) .
