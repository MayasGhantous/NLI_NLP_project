  there is some sort of polish dish that was probably invented by some kind of evil communist mastermind and they probably taught it in some kind of courses for pre-school teachers . 
  it 's absolutly disgusting . 
  and i do n't know one person that would like that - they only served it in preschools and elementary schools , i do n't think they still do ( bu it was a nightmare of my dad 's childhood too ) . 
  and it 's diabolical twin , [ ry\u017c z truskawkami ] ( http://i2.pinger.pl/pgr105/c3f0911600169ac84cd986d3/ryz_z_truskawkami_popup_watermark.jpg ) . 
  yngh . 
  there is also [ sweet white cheese macaroni ] ( http://dariaanna.blog.onet.pl/wp-content/blogs.dir/673695/files/blog_nu_4594147_6900702_tr_makaron_z_serem_bialym_na_slodko.jpg ) which was kinda good . 
  but it 's about last dish i 'd think of to cook for myself to eat . 
  * [ pegasus ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/pegasus_console%2bpad%2bgame.jpg ) - basically nintendo famicom ( nes ) produced on taiwan and imported to poland . 
  it was before intellectual property law was a thing , so you could buy for few zlotys a cartridge with tons of games on it . 
  90s style gaming in its finest , psx was too expensive . 
  after pegasus people bought pcs and pc gaming was ( and is still now ) big in poland , consoles started to be very popular with ps3 ( ps2 was also somewhat popular ) . 
  now i 'm trying to play all those classics that i could not , so i bought snes and n64 and i 've been planning on buying dreamcast too . 
  it 's funny that those things are so cheap now . 
  * [ lay 's tazos ] ( http://lata90te.blox.pl/resource/tazo05.jpg ) - first it was star wars , after that pokemon . 
  * [ pokemon ] ( http://www.consoleclassix.com/info_img/pokemon_red_version_gbc_screenshot4.gif ) - as i 've mentioned , tazos but also cards ( but noone gave shit about playing them - i did build a deck but everyone was just collecting them ) , anime and of course video game . 
  but again , n64 was too expensive , so emulators of gbc and gbc itself were far more popular . 
  my mum bought me a gbc ( it was insanely expensive ) but buying any games for it was out of my reach , so i had only two - pokemon yellow and game and watch gallery . 
  * [ fucking a team ] ( http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/a-team.jpg ) - in early ninties it was big . 
  the same goes for other cult tv series like hercules , xena , walker texas ranger , thunder in paradise ( with hulk hogan !, 
  ) , macgyver , x-files and so on . 
  * anime - sailor moon , daimos , dragon ball , magic knight rayearhear ( or something like this , i could n't even say it properly ) , yaiba , slayers , soulhunter ( this one is still really good ) . 
  every kid was watching those . 
  not only , situation in belarus is n't that good either ... 
  so this guy , [ john godson ] ( http://7.s.dziennik.pl/pliki/4583000/4583220-john-godson-900-668.jpg ) is a conservative mp in poland . 
  i 'd vote for him if he was from my constituency . 
  there was a big surprise among leftist media when he supported ban on abortion and said that he 's opposed to gay unions . 
  * what ?!, 
  he 's not one of us ?!, 
  but he 's black !, 
  * as if black person could n't be a conservative ( and he 's a pentacostal pastor from nigeria , it 's quite obvious that he 's not a liberal ) . 
  i suppose that most people voted for him because he 's black . 
  but now he proved himself as an independent politician with strong morals ( he resigned from a ruling party because he did n't agree with it on social issues ) . 
  well , i did this and got turkey . 
  also you 're supposed to do the skinning in an open space and in a bucket filled with water , are n't you ? 
  those too !, 
  it 's crazy how good are top british comedians . 
  8 out of 10 facts was my main show during summer break - when i got from my internship i 'd watch it till i 'm asleep . 
  and it 's stiil so uselessly idiotic . 
  but david mitchell . 
  actually , it became my `` get to sleep '' show after south park and whose line . 
  i turn on some of your shows ( usually qi ) and i am able to sleep . 
  without it i 'd be thinking about life and other confusing things . 
  :-d so beer + qi is my sleep deprivation formula . 
  show that hooked me on british tv . 
  now i even watch nonsense shows like `` would i lie to you ? '', 
  or `` big fat quiz '' - and i do n't understand half of the jokes , because they are so anglo-centric . 
  shame that there are maybe two shows in poland that i enjoy ... 
  actually , this is current map : http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-eu-monthly-201309-201310-map, 
  you know it 's bs ? 
  he needs money and public support - this way he needs a political party . 
  the idea of a president `` above all the divisions '' ( `` ponad podzia\u0142ami '' ) is nonsense and a spell-like sentence that has nothing to do with reality of politics . 
  do n't mention that match , it was horrible ... 
  we 're in the same boat . 
  god , when i read `` wc '' i 've thought about toilet . 
  but sure , i 'm rooting for bah !, 
  i do n't know , last two matches were n't * that * bad . 
  sure , we lost both of them , but i think there is a change of attitude among our players who were miserable even against san marino . 
  the real problem is that our players suck mainly because they 're in worse shape than for example england 's team . 
  there are diffrent types of pollution - this article is biased , data used by them is only for particulate matter . 
  maybe they have high nitrogene dioxide or co2 results . 
  yeah , i know this one . 
  :-) thanks . 
  fuck , third place . 
  i know it 's bad but this is nuts ... and it would be cool to see some newer data . 
  also , thoughtcrime . 
  okay but montenegro and serbia are no longer one state . 
  so it 's quite natural to adjust written language to a spoken one , when there is no internal reasons ( like with germany and reading of `` ich '' as `` ich '' or `` i\u015b '' - one country with one language , it would be quite a bother to even distinguish where people talk in which dialect with cities like berlin ) . 
  they want to do so - cool , let them do so . 
  even if reasons seem nationalistic to you - preventing them from doing so/saying that it 's stupid is also somewhat nationalistci on your part - it 's never ending circle of diffrent views . 
  and both options are rational and understandable . 
  turkey is also a balkan nation . 
  it 's just `` s '' and `` z '' with kreska . 
  they 've already existed in polish , belarussian latin ( shame they use mainly cyrillic alphabet ) and lower sorbian . 
  and they mean more or less the same sound . 
  i love how you write '' \u0179 '' in polish . 
  heh , there is even a song by a band from kaliningrad about shopping in poland : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dujyctyaqsi it would be cool if they were an independent state - but , you know , it 's like a russian military airport 300 km ( or maybe even less ) from warsaw . 
  it still does not make any sense to me . 
  it 's just misleading . 
  you wrote `` dick is walking around me '' which is wrong . 
  those two `` obchodzi\u0107 '' mean something completely diffrent . 
   dick is walking around me . 
  lol no ? 
  `` obchodzi\u0107 '' means both to walk around something to get to another side of this thing and to be concerned about something . 
  the literral version would be `` dick i care '' . 
   doing so must follow a strategy of regional or global ethnic extermination . 
  killing inteligentsia and elites first is a strategy . 
  especially if it means killing 200 000 out of about 15 millions that lived under german rule in years 1939-1941 . 
  i can speak for krak\u00f3w and it 's probably the same in prague or other ce cities with decent it sector - you 'll get paid less than in any mentioned by you country but costs of living are low . 
  and you 'll earn more than a pole/czech etc. 
  just because you 're a foreigner and if you 're good at your job - you 'll be very succesful . 
  i had edited my post before i 've noticed you had responded - i should write that it was edit , my bad and i 'm sorry for that . 
  how come you do n't want to name killing two millions of poles a genocide ? 
  it was n't big enough ? 
  and i 'll give voice to timothy snyder , surely a pole : 200,000 polish civilians were killed between 1939 and 1941 in occupied poland , with each regime responsible for about half of those deaths [ 12 ] most of the victims were the intellectual and political elite of poland . 
  according to snyder , both stalin and hitler wanted to eliminate the leadership of the polish nation . 
  did n't you read what i 've posted ? 
  nazi officials said that their plan is to wipe out all poles . 
  and they 've killed 2 millions of them . 
  it was a genocide .
