  oh and mindless killing of about 200 000 people during warsaw uprising was what if not a genocide ?!, 
  short quote : the german nazi crimes against the polish nation , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] claimed approximately 5.6 million , [ 4 ] to 5.8 million lives , [ 5 ] of whom 3.1 million were polish jews , [ 4 ] two million were ethnic poles , and the remaining half-a-million minorities . 
  [ by wikipedia ] one more : genocide was to be conducted systematically against polish people : on september 7 , 1939 reinhard heydrich stated that all polish nobles , clergy and jews are to be killed . 
  on september 12 wilhelm keitel added the intelligentsia to the list . 
  at the end of 1940 hitler demanded liquidation of `` all leading elements in poland '' , and on march 15 , 1940 himmler stated : `` all polish specialists will be exploited in our military-industrial complex . 
  later , all poles will disappear from this world . 
  it is imperative that the great german nation considers the elimination of all polish people as its chief task . 
  '' [ 16 ] i have nothing against germans as long as they do n't try to talk about wwii and say such sick things like you do . 
  well , you 're simply wrong . 
  attack is an offensive action performed on another party . 
  tell me , when poland attacked any of the german states ( and do n't mention teutonic knights , it was a monastic state with both ethnic german and polish citizens ) . 
  and joking about efficiency in context of genocide is sick . 
  and wine . 
  but we still like vodka . 
  tatanka is also a correct word . 
  it means `` bison '' in lakota and comes from `` dancing with wolves '' : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrgpw4o_5cc, 
  they 're popular even in vietnam . 
  how it was mutual ? 
  we 've never attacked germany in our history . 
  not only that - there is history of polish migrations to the uk prior to the open market times ( after wwii ) . 
  also - poles know english , so this is the country ( together with ireland , which became second poland ) with least language barrier possible . 
  did you drink it with apple juice ? 
  the easiest and the best drink in the world . 
  that 's really nice town !, 
  and they have one of the most well known type of polish w\u00f3dka - '' \u015aliwowica \u0141\u0105cka '' which can be upo to 80 % of alc . 
  once . 
  by napoleon . 
  in 1918 we 've gained independence by ourselfs , the same in 1989 . 
  actually he liberated poland . 
  and the only thing i knew was damned * dragonstea din tei * . 
  half of europe understands a good bread , do n't be so cocky . 
  * [ jacek kaczmarski - mury ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ygs9vhmfs0 ) ( 1980 ) * [ jan pietrzak - \u017beby polska by\u0142a polsk\u0105 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrdlyffba1a ) ( 1981 ) two anthems of `` solidarity '' and polish anti-communist underground . 
  the second one won the audience prize on 1981 opole festival . 
  and both were ( and are ) widely popular . 
  / r/polska is pretty much dead anyway . 
  / r/poland is the right place , however we have lots of non-polish redditors out there , as well as polish expats and polonia . 
  me too . 
  well , cn was one of the best ways to learn language . 
  i 've also picked a bit of german watching rtl2 ( ranma 1/2 , detective conan etc. 
  haha , that 's an unexpected coincidence . 
  ] ( https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctcseji4_pekv9lvwk6rd8f_peomghsvwoi62mtzezzbrg7l0my ) europe is also quite pretty . 
  if you want colder places - avoid cities , they are always hotter . 
  imo a nice place to spend few days is [ eger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eger ) region . 
  lots of thermae/pools , nice city with good restaurants and interesting sights , nature and , last but not least , cheap and good wine . 
  beautiful lady valley where you can drink a glass of wine for 30 eurocents . 
  yeah , i was just saying that maple syrup is fucking expensive . 
  or pizza factory . 
  try [ samui ] ( http://www.samui.com.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=140&amp;itemid=159 ) on wi\u015blna , it 's awesome . 
  i 'm thinking about curry + thai beer , it would be around 50-60 pln . 
  it is . 
  i know plenty of at least decent places in cracow where i can order good meal for 50 pln for two . 
  i 'm not talking about top-notch restaurants but good ones ( like genuienly thai restaurant or good italian trattoria ) . 
  so following / u/oon4321 question - are aztecs canadian ? 
  and 50 pln is a dinner for two . 
  what about george washington carver , the best of all george washingtons ? 
  thanks !, 
  could you translate what are those guys talking about after the part with this italian schmuck ? 
  in southern poland blueberries are called bor\u00f3wki . 
  jagoda = berry . 
  polish take on multilingual folk-rap : [ sobota 100 procent 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnidyift14y ) . 
  i do n't like rap at all but i love this song . 
  you have also some [ glorious music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo7mwuj7zla ) . 
  add a guy from italia and we have axis-reborn . 
  also : try to beat this : [ jakob bienenhalm - jockel , der gartenteichspringbrunnen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pkkav00cw8 ), 
  yeah , karpatia is basically rac . 
  but rac evolved in last years from things like honor or konkwista 88 ( neopaganism/neonazism ; although there were good songs by those bands like [ bramy vallhali ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlsojo7ci9a ) ) . 
  most songs by karpatia are really good and they had great collaboration with one of the best polish rock musicians , andrzej nowak from tsa/z \u0142e psy . 
  i like some rac songs but i also like some songs by leftist punk bands . 
  diversity . 
  haha , bregovic said once that they started bjelo dugme to get chicks . 
  :-d as for kusturica : [ pitbull ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbxa_-nvs88 ) terrier !, 
  5 % -8 % in poland . 
  i do n't see why romania would be considered eastern europe in the first place . 
  the only thing that connects you with eastern europe is being part of communist bloc for 50 years and that 's all ( orthodox christianity is part of south-east european identity that was adapted by the east ! ) . 
  the same goes with poland . 
  we 're not part of the east , never were . 
  we are a western nastion in central europe , we 're catholics , we were n't conquered by mongols , we write with latin alphabet and so on . 
  we are a border country , as well as romania . 
  but we 're not eastern europe , neither are you guys !, 
  also , there is nothing wrong with being a citizen of a country that is in eastern europe , to be clear . 
  i 'm trying to defend you and you 're just mehing me . 
  yay for cracow and this unbearable heat !, 
  :p 27 celsius after 19:30 is n't something i enjoy . 
  :d  any number of z\u0142oty under 10 can be expressed as ` blach/y ' ( 2 blachy , 5 blach ) ( sheets of metal ) wutwut ?!, 
   z\u0142ot\u00f3wa is a derogatory term for a cab driver where are you from ? 
  they 're apparently promoting this shit in poland - notice that there are lyrics and title in polish in this clip . 
  this kind of music is getting more and more popular in poland - large amount of listeners listen to it to laugh at it . 
  but it 's still a piece o crap . 
  :p happy cakeday !, 
  so it was n't probably the first one . 
  he 's a celebrity so they make up shit like this . 
  romania is rather a southern nation . 
  you guys are also responsible for this [ shit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iugfurqyhs ) . 
  god , why does your crappy `` musicians '' make `` music '' for polish audience ? 
  money - kasa ( cash ) , kapucha ( cabbage ) , regionally - dutki ( from ducat ) , siano ( hay ) , hajs ( no idea what does it mean ) , kasiora . 
  z\u0142oty ( pln ) - zyle , z\u0142ocisze grosze - grosisze , grosiaki 1 , 2 and 5 grosze - miedziaki ( copper ; as i think of this , we do have copper , silver and gold as in d&d ... ) 1 z\u0142 - z\u0142ot\u00f3wka 2 z\u0142 - dw\u00f3jka 5 z\u0142 - pi\u0105tak 10 z\u0142 - dycha , dyszka 20 z\u0142 - dwie dychy , dwie dyszki 50 z\u0142 - pi\u0119\u0107 dych , pi\u0119\u0107 dyszek 100 z\u0142 - st\u00f3wa , st\u00f3wka , ba\u0144ka 200 z\u0142 - dwie st\u00f3wy , dwie ba\u0144ki, 
  it 's a thing that tracks back into disputes in `` solidarno\u015b\u0107 '' - `` gazeta wyborcza '' is a newspaper that supports the leftist side of anti-communist opposition and is defending communists like jaruzelski or rakowski . 
  all along they act like a bunch of prophets and tell how poland is a backwater of the world and poles are simpletons and ignorants . 
  but in the other hand medias like `` gazeta polska codzennie '' are also unreadable - they are as biased as `` gazeta wyborcza '' but in favour of another political option . 
  let 's turn wolin into australia of europe .
