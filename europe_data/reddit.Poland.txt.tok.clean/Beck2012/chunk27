  when thousands of poles were tortured , imprisoned and killed because they were against communist regime . 
  sure , it was n't all-bad time . 
  but i think that comparision with 1950s is inappropriate . 
  especially if you choose a minor group of angry youths as an exapmle of nowadays patriots . 
  i 'm fine with it but only if they 'll give us borussia dortmund with it . 
  tbh , poles from cities like szczecin buy houses in germany , because they are cheaper and they can still drive to work in poland . 
  it 's from word dres meaning a tracksuit . 
  but it was rather a 1990s phenomena . 
  their women would be called `` blacharki '' ( from blacha , basically sheet metal , a reference to fondness of `` good '' cars , mainly vw golf and old bmw ) or `` solary '' ( from solarium ) . 
  today i was at [ zakrz\u00f3wek ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/zakrz%c3%b3wek_\\ ( krak % c3 % b3w \\ ) - kamieniolom.jpg ) ( cracow ! ) . 
  half of the people there were foreign nationals ( mainly spanish students ) . 
  besides , usa has got the best technology and was willing to invest a lot of money in this system . 
  at the time , we were also one of the most important partners for the us in europe . 
  and natural rivalization between usa and russia is also something good for poland - sort of guarantee of safety . 
  remember 2007 and georgia . 
  russia is a dangerous dictatorship . 
  isaac asimov was born on a territory which belonged to poland in 17th century , so i 'd say `` the caves of steel '' . 
  :-) but more seriously - `` the doll '' by boles\u0142aw prus . 
   the doll has been regarded by some , including nobel laureate czes\u0142aw mi\u0142osz , as the greatest polish novel . 
  according to prus biographer zygmunt szweykowski , it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive , compelling picture of an entire society http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_doll_ ( novel ) and this is true , it 's not only about aristocracy but commoners too . 
  try `` the star diaries '' if you have n't read it . 
  my favourite work by lem . 
  i meant formal structure and ideas , not members . 
  i happen to know that there was some kind of friction between commies and rest of the world . 
  i wan that european community . 
  i 've read that according to bralczyk it is . 
  i do n't necessarilly think that it is but to me `` murzyn '' is way more natural word to say . 
  and yeah , we have significant immigrant groups - mainly ukrainians , belarussians , russians . 
  and vietnamese , and chinese . 
  but they are not seen as a problem , except for vietnamese and russian mafia . 
  the real problem is that both sides has got more firepower than the rest of the world combined . 
  and that 's the reason why usa owes money to china . 
  yes , i understood that too . 
  but you know , i do n't want you to think that i 'm some kind of jerk ( well , i might be , but not because of that !, 
  well , / u/futski is right . 
  i like finnish coutryside - cities feel empty . 
  yeah , i 've been joking with this attitude . 
  i 've been to stockholm and copenhagen when i was few years old and it was about 20 years ago , so it probably does n't count . 
  but i 've been in helsinki about four or five years ago . 
  quite boring city , if you ask me . 
  lots of secondhand bookstores , more than newsstands . 
  and thank god for swedish signs , without them i 'd be lost ( knowing german and english helps ) . 
  and i 've met a woman in turku who did n't speak any english . 
  i thought that everyone in finland speaks english . 
  and it was a dire situation , because me and my pal wandered at about 5 in the morning ( we woke up early , before the rest of our group - it was a school trip ) to some docks and did n't know how to get back to our hostel . 
  somehow we managed to get back but we had to run for some time . 
  baltic states has got far more interesting cities - tallin and vilnius are quite cool ( although they are too small to stay there for more than 2-3 days ) . 
  there are far more people learning russian - thus , it 's better to learn polish . 
   i 'd like to be able to look in lithuanian archives to do genealogy research polish , russian and latin would be more helpful . 
  especially latin , if you want to do any genealogical research in catholic country . 
  lithuanian has n't been used as an official language before 1918 . 
  w\u00f3dka !, 
  http://0701.nccdn.net/4_2/000/000/0d3/9f3/124841291723723.jpg they were cool, 
  as you say . 
  it 's still something we refer to in poland . 
  it 's not that far away . 
  you transport people in high-speed , not products . 
  lorries are good enough for fresh produce . 
  you do n't need high-speed railroad for freight . 
  so that 's why you do n't throw your food almost at all ... 
  and `` pole '' ( read : `` poleh '' ) means field . 
  also , in some languages ( like turkish ) poland is called lechia or lechistan ( lengyelorsz\u00e1g in hungarian ) - it 's either from our legendary founder , prince lech , or from proto-polish tribe of l\u0119dzianie . 
  we 've never banned anyone on / r/poland , you can be our first political refugee if you want !, 
  even this half-assed socialistic version of free market we have nowadays in poland led us to some sort of wealth . 
  i do n't even imagine what would happen if we had eastern-asian regulations ... socialism is not an answer . 
  we did our lesson on that . 
  not only by starvation . 
  one of the biggest pre-ww2 massacres was done by those bolshevik scums : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_ ( 1937 % e2 % 80 % 931938 )  the polish operation of the nkvd in 1937 -- 1938 was a soviet great purge-era mass operation against purported polish agents in the soviet union , explicitly ordered against polish spies , but interpreted by the nkvd as relating to `` absolutely all poles '' . 
  ** it resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people and the execution of 111,091 poles ** , [ 1 ] and those accused of working for poland . 
  [ 2 ] the operation was implemented according to nkvd order \u2116 00485 signed by nikolai yezhov . 
  [ 3 ] not all , but the majority were ethnic poles according to timothy snyder : 85,000 is given by him as a `` conservative estimate '' of the number of executed poles . 
  [ 4 ] the remainder being ` suspected ' to be polish without further inquiry . 
  [ 3 ] nkvd personnel gathered polish-sounding names from local telephone books in order to speed up the process . 
  ** in leningrad alone , almost 7,000 citizens were rounded up . 
  a vast majority of them were executed within 10 days of arrest . 
  ** [ 5 ] in the fourteen months after the adoption of order \u2116 00485 , ** 143,810 people were captured , of whom 139,885 were sentenced by extrajudical organs , and 111,091 executed ( nearly 80 % of all victims ) ** we have all the reasons to hate communism . 
  and after that the west joined forces with them ... stalin began ** ethnic purges ** before hitler !, 
  almost none . 
  we have kashubian , which is basically other language . 
  silesian - which is a polish dialect ( grammar stays the same !, 
  ) , g\u00f3ralski / highlander - in mountains . 
  those are three languages/dialects that really stand out . 
  and every region of poland has got a slightly diffrent way of speaking but because of tv it 's becoming less and less visible . 
  for example , there are expressions like `` wyj\u015b\u0107 na pole '' ( `` go out on a field '' ) and `` wyj\u015b\u0107 na dw\u00f3r '' ( `` go out on a manor '' ) - both means the same , going outside but the first one is used in south ( ma\u0142opolskie ) and the second one is used in the rest of the country . 
  there are other words - like we ( south ) use word flizy for tiles and rest of the country says p\u0142ytki . 
  not very big diffrences . 
  also , in cracow/zakopane etc. 
  we use often ending '' \u017ce '' in imperative ( `` we\u017a\u017ce '' ) , instead of `` trz '' say `` cz '' ( `` trzysta '' / `` czysta '' ) . 
  in words like `` krakowski '' we do n't say `` w '' -  krakoski . 
  good for you . 
  and you think that some magical euro-people would come and actually do this ? 
  first off , they would have to speak the language of their area - which means that they would still be the same people who are in the police force e.g. 
  in bulgaria . 
  they would n't be less corrupt just because they would be employed by eu . 
  also - letting foreign officers to work in poland on the invitation from our government is a big issue nowadays in poland and there will be some protests against it in march . 
  so there would also be huge objections from society itself . 
  we have to invest in basics - in creating moral and honest society . 
  treating the disease by founding another , useless force ( because it ** would have to ** use the same resources as institutions we have now . 
  you imagine how much would it cost ? 
  i hate it this way .
