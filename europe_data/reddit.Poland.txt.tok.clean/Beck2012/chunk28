  one-three cups of white/black coffee . 
  made in my coffee maker ( ekspres ci\u015bnieniowy in polish , i do n't know how you call it in english ) . 
  but only when i 'm at home all day , usually i drink water and beer in the evening . 
  i do n't have time for coffee but i like it very much . 
  horse is tasty . 
  half of the ikea stuff is made in poland . 
  [ tl ; dr ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chi7qtfprxo ), 
  it 's not matter of individual choices but of larger , political context . 
  cheju islands are important issue that still is not and will not be resolved . 
  korean culture is hyper-confucian , more than chinese and a lot more than japanese . 
  and chinese popular culture is also based on japanese . 
  whole lolita , anime , pop , etc. , etc. 
  in china is a rip-off of japanese popculture . 
  you mix three diffrent layers - cultural identity or civilization/core values which are derived from chinese confucianism . 
  popculture which is based on japanese ideas ( although k-pop managed to create something diffrent from j-pop but the base idea was the same ) - but seeing rain 's face on billboards in beijing metro is n't something uncommon . 
  and last but not least - political issues . 
  and they are crucial . 
  you do n't make big politics based on which countries culture your citizens likes best . 
  also , discrimination of korean nationals in japan is still ** big ** thing . 
  but xenophobia in asian countries is still really prevalent . 
  even people from ryukyu/okinawa are treated as worse sort in japan . 
  taiwan is called the biggest aircraft carrier in world - roc is dependent on usa and this dependency is viewed as a threat by prc . 
  also , if it were n't for green coalition ( pro-independance parties in roc ) and usa , the unification of china and , probably , some sort of democratization or rather transformation of prc would happen quicker . 
  prc , having usa-based agenda on taiwan , has to sustain dprk . 
  this country is like a vicious dog on a short leash used to bully neighbours - all of them are close allies of the usa and with all of them , except for rok , prc has territorial disputes . 
  now , unification of korea could have benefitial consequences for prc - it 's hard to imagine that rok would be anti-chinese after the unification . 
  but there are us bases on their territory , so it is possible that they would be still under heavy influence of the usa - and having usa bases in a bordering country is not something that prc could allow to happen . 
  on the other hand - there would have to be heavy investments in northern part of korean peninsula due to tragic situation of infrastructure and terrible state of industry . 
  most of contracts would be won by chinese , i 'm sure of it . 
  but again , costs of those investments would slow down korean economy drastically , which would mean troubles of other chinese companies , which trade with rok ( and there are lots of them ) . 
  now situation is quite stable and controlled to some extent by chinese - also , they are not endangered by dprk . 
  so it 's better for them to maintain current status quo . 
  and they are the only country that could disarm dprk . 
  prc would love to have one korean state - and the best for them would be if it was rok , not dprk . 
  why ? 
  because rok would naturally be pro-chinese ( because of border incidents with japan and , well , history ) . 
  rok is an important trade partner for prc - dprk is not , it 's just taking money , chinese have to invest a lot of money into kim 's regime and they get only one thing in return - political pressure . 
  why they need political pressure through , more or less controlling dprk ? 
  look at map , do you see that quite big island east from china ? 
  yep , taiwan , or rather roc . 
  as long as roc is independent , prc wo n't allow for unification of korea . 
  they treat dprk as a wild card in this game . 
  i 'd add speedway , boxing , k-1-like figting federations , tennis , formula 1 . 
   ( china = $ 3 ) i had to pay fortune for visa to china . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; and we 've been their allies since 1949 , sheesh . 
  c'mon , the king was from lithuania .

  bahasa is even better - ridiculously easy grammar and phonetics and half of words are either from dutch or english ( depends on which bahasa it is - indonesia or malaysia ) . 
  why wo n't you crosspost it ? 
  both of you are aweful . 
  i know lots of old , happily married couples . 
  i 'll stick with what / u/mondlicht wrote . 
  i also find it inspiring and i hope it 'll be the way i 'll live my life . 
  fun fact - beer bavaria is brewed in the netherlands . 
  for once luxembourg is a big man of europe . 
  i 've found this article : http://air-is-addicting.hubpages.com/hub/how-is-lord-of-the-rings-parallel-to-world-war-ii and i think this map is really , really off and does n't provide any insight . 
  we have to remember about political and historical context of the times when tolkien created lotr . 
  as a pole , i 've seen it as a struggle between atheistic cccp as mordor ( remember that tolkien was deeply religious ! ), 
  and christian countries of west . 
  with poland as gondor ( as a front state ) and england as pretty safe shire . 
  of course , we have problem , what to do with germany - certainly a pagan ideology of hitler does n't allow us to place this state as gondor , i do n't see how it could be rohan . 
  so - isengard . 
  germany fell as isengard - tolkien wrote lotr before the end of the war so i think that we might assume that , using paralell , he thought that journey should end on the mount doom/kremlin . 
  of course we can not assume that 100 % of lotr was political but i firmly stand with cccp/mordor theory and poland/gondor , germany/isengard are also plausible . 
  it looks like an article by a 12 year old for a school paper . 
  if she said that diveristy is good and might help in solving problems , she should also say how it helps . 
  and inform about downsides of this phenomena . 
  it lacks any content . 
  [ pi\u0105tek ( friday ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pi%c4%85tek,_%c5%81%c3%b3d%c5%ba_voivodeship ) is in the middle of poland !, 
  [ hel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hel,_poland ) is in the north , where we were kicking vikings asses !, 
  well , not necessarily - i do n't think that ` liberalization ' of public discourse is determined . 
  i do n't belive in a deterministic view of history or social change . 
  those visits should be allowed as well as participation in organizing a burial . 
  but i do n't think that civil partnerships would be a good way to solving them . 
  solve it with normal civil agreements/will . 
  there is no need to create new beings . 
  where is hel ? 
   i 've met a lot of nationalist skinhead types , which i assume are the same guys writing that stuff on the internet . 
  well , not at all . 
  i 'm conservative , even monarchist , but i 'm not a skinhead . 
  i 'm well educated , most of my friends share right-wing ideas as well as lots of university professors ( and note that i 'm studying law and social studies , engineering departments are traditionally ** very ** conservative/anti-socialist ) . 
  speaking in a language of cultural studies - diffrent core values . 
   `` we do n't want your votes , go away '' `` we are interested in 10 % of votes '' - back when sld ( post-commies ) tried to get back to power and succeeded they did n't say a bad word about church . 
  because if you are openly anti-clerical , you 'll get few percent of votes ( mostly from ex-party members and their families ) but you wo n't be able to get to the majority of voters .
