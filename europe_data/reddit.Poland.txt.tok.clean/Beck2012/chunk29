  but still - you may get few percent and exist in parliament as a minor party . 
  left-wing voters are about 15 % of voters in poland . 
  traditionalists of various provenance about twice as much . 
  well , no , i did not . 
  but trivializing this catastrophe is wrong . 
  * kubica might get back to f1 !, 
  * smole\u0144sk - russians still do n't want to give us wreckage . 
  eu parliament 's comission intervened in this ; we can see a huge change in governments attitude , they 've stopped simling to russians and started acting - which is good but it 's a shame that it happens almost three years after catastrophe . 
  also , polish prosecutors are going to smole\u0144sk to do some research on a birch . 
  again , three years too late . 
  * there is some contaminated milk . 
  * russian 's embargho on eu potatoes . 
  * boeing dreamliners and poor condition of lot ( polish airlines ) . 
  * modlin airport - finished for euro , for last month it 's closed because they were too hasty and runaway is shitty . 
  * jarek and late lech 's kaczynski mother died few days ago . 
  * atariis cloe to a bankruptcy . 
  ;( [ now i 'm waiting as polish crowd will downvote me for mentioning smole\u0144sk ... ], 
  / r/slava is n't a very lively place . 
  no , i do n't agree . 
  size and authencity of cracow 's \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie is unique . 
  both 1st and 2nd ww did n't touch the historic architecture of this city . 
  best served with apple juice and cinnamon . 
  tastes like applepie , mmmmm ... 
  i live in krak\u00f3w four years and really like it here . 
  city rapidly changes , there are a lot of things to see - museum of aeronautics , museum of transport , old uj buildings , a lot of butiful buildings in \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie , rynek is a magnificent place , as well as st. mary 's cathedral . 
  dozens of incredible churches , hell , ** wawel ** . 
  wawel is awesome too . 
  dozens of nice pubs , bars , restaurants and cafes ( jama michalika ! ) . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://images.photo.bikestats.eu/zdjecie,600,26196,20080702,krakow-zakrzowek-lazur.jpg ) 15 minutes in tram from [ this ] ( http://blog.4hotele.pl/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wawel-od-strony-wisly1.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.restauracjekrakow.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/krakow-rynek-glowny1.jpg ) . 
  and air is getting better . 
  i love this city , living in town so old and well preserved is fun . 
  drinking in ancient catacombs and eating in [ `` gothic macdonald 's ] ( http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/mg12xhmlyr0/mqdefault.jpg ) is something worth experiancing . 
  i 'm not saying that other cities in poland are not worth seeing ( i 'm from zakopane and i think that zakopane is also worth seeing but not in a high season , rather in spetember or october ) . 
  but saying that cracow is not worth seeing sounds plain stupid to me . 
  how can you say that krak\u00f3w is overrated ? 
  o_o it is not , according to polls , 90 % of tourists did like it here . 
  if you like nature , sure . 
  large part of the only primeval forest in europe is there . 
  oh , it looks like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/poland_bialowieza_-_bpn.jpg ) . 
  this photo is from poland but it 's the same in belarus . 
  but this is one decision that you can not even regret if you make it in the first place . 
  yeah , they are . 
  social stuff by palikot is extremely leftist ( funny thing is that he was owner of very catholic weekly few years ago , well , people change ) . 
  but economically he 's absolutely undefined - usually he presents pro-bussiness tendencies ( his economical voice is giba\u0142a , young bussinessman from krak\u00f3w , quite fiscal-conservative ) . 
  edit : and that 's why i say he 's a populist . 
  this party does n't have consistent policies . 
  those are nonexistent issues in polish politics . 
  and poles tend to be more fiscal conservative than people in western europe ( more union-oriented also tend to be very religious , so there is no space for any kind of socialists/leftist , polish sld was more fiscal conservative than po when it was a ruling party ) . 
  so there is no space for leftist parties ( palikot 's movement is more populist-liberal than leftist ) . 
  this article brought up quite important person - janusz \u015awitaj . 
  he is a living proof that decision to perform euthanasia might not be a good one . 
  few years ago he [ told ] ( http://www.rynekzdrowia.pl/po-godzinach/janusz-switaj-chcial-umrzec-a-dzisiaj-chlonie-zycie-pracuje-uczy-sie-pomaga-innym,6316,10,2.html ) that he was going to withdraw his petition to perform euthanasia . 
  he 's an important person as a fundraiser and spokesman of disabled . 
  he 's also an author . 
  i 'm not in favor of euthanasia . 
  but i 'm also not 100 % against it . 
  it 's a very complicated matter , it 's hard to find a clear line between rational decision and a decision based on extreme mental/physical pain in this kind of situation . 
  but i 'm definately afraid of abuse of this kind of law . 
  in polish there is a word hucpa , it 's from hebrew , not yiddish and means a grand scandal or a big impolitness .

  you 're welcome . 
  mentioned by / u/oldchild `` alternatywy 4 '' is also a really good show . 
  polish : * [ czas honoru/time of honour ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1287566/ ) - pretty good war series , * [ czterej pancerni i pies/four tankmen and a dog ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czterej_pancerni_i_pies ) it 's a cult series . 
  beware - it 's a good fun but also a propaganda ( one of the best ever made in the eastern block ) . 
  you can easily find english subtitles ( e.g. 
  [ here ] ( http://en.podnapisi.net/czterej-pancerni-i-pies-1966-subtitles-p1667987 ) . 
  * [ czterdziestolatek/being 40 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czterdziestolatek ) - good communism-era comedy show . 
  piskorski 's sd during the presidential election did n't even support their official candidate andrzej olechowski ( fun fact - piskorski was po 's [ a ruling party ] president of warsaw and olechowksi was one of three co-founders of this party ) . 
  local comitees supported korwin-mikke and kaczy\u0144ski . 
  i adore him . 
  also vaclav klaus and viktor orban . 
  you might not be a right-winger but you have to admit that they have balls . 
  * as for polish politicians - marek jurek , he 's really faithful to his ideas . 
  and janusz korwin-mikke , because he 's a badass . 
  i 've voted for him and his party ever since i can and hope to do so as long as it will be possible . 
  which does n't have any separatist groups . 
  it 's not true , the poorest regions of poland are mazury and lubuskie - both are pro-po . 
  sld is not socialist , they are unideaological post-commies . 
  they were far more fiscally conservative than po . 
  but it 's important . 
  mate , the kings and magnateria were mostly lithuanians !, 
  most of our official titles are taken straight from military . 
  warlords ) in charge of governmental administration in wojew\u00f3dztwa ( lit . 
  our sejmiki wojew\u00f3dzkie are also led by marshalls . 
  let 's make an empire tofether again , plz !, 
  those lands never were yours . 
  and there is only one thing serenissima res publica coronae regni poloniae magnique ducatus lithuaniae can [ tell you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjvhbz9r1i4 ) . 
  * checks the last time hungary was invaded ... *, 
  okay , for those who do not know polish constitution - marshall ( speaker ) of senate is the third person in the country . 
  the first being president , the second marshall of sejm , the fourth prime minister . 
  prime minister has got the most power in his/her hands , but according to protocol , marshall of senate is more important . 
  you 've got us , putin , bachka and baltic potato famine as neighbours . 
  that did n't make me feel better at all !, 
  it 's hard to get in poland , i have to go to slovakia to buy it . 
  czechs were traditionally pretty close to russia . 
  in 1930s they were considered a threat to poland , because of their close ties to soviets . 
  also , the panslavic congress was held in prague in the 19th century . 
  i suppose that the only country , where pan-slavism was never popular , was poland .
