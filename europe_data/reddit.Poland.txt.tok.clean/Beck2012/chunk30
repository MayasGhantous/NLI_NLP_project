  even during partitions our national identity was n't as threatened by germans , as was czechs ' . 
  russia was our enemy since 10th century , there was no way we could accept willingly to create one country with russians as a leading force ( especially with their samoderzhaviye , which is incompatible with our traditional golden liberty ) . 
  we 've got a town called ameryka . 
  orzel5 is a polish username . 
  and pretty generic . 
  as if it was ... generated . 
  and then we can buld our capital . 
  oh , i 'm a germanophile , really . 
  : * [ let 's drink !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ku-2t3r8y ), 
  and means people that ca n't speak . 
  basically barbarians . 
  and we 've beaten them 2-0 . 
  two things - viet trans are fun . 
  use them . 
  sapa is a must-see , next time you 're around hanoi , visit it . 
  cars need roads . 
  especialy after events that took place 70 years ago . 
  it was my submission ( not my photo though ) . 
  i agree it 's not visually great , but it 's a unique place and the fact that not beauty but history of the building were more appealing ... well , i think that 's good . 
  pretty photos are really common but interesting story is more unique . 
  and i 've posted it soon after this subreddit has started , so it got attention . 
  tbh i just love this building , i know there are prettier churches and castles in poland , but st. andrew 's is just badass . 
  well , i 've had an internship in an embassy and i 've worked for some time in a consulate . 
  there 's no way someone could forge a passport with a chip , he would have to hack the database and write in his telemetric data ( apart from photo - fingerprints ) . 
  as / u/totallynotapuppy has written - stolen passport trade is a huge thing , but you wo n't cross border of the eu with it ( because when they check your passport they get owners photo and fingerprints in a computer ) . 
  there are also instances of selling paaports by eu citizens , i 've heard that one can get around 2 500 euro for a passport . 
  it 's too late , it was done three times already !, 
  1419 , 1618 and 1948 ( jan masaryk ) . 
  it 's impossible with eu countries . 
  passports with chips ( which are a standart here ) are impossible to forge , because if you scan the chip , all the data ( like photo for example ) has to show up on the screen . 
  so even if the photo in physical passport is somehow changed , there is no way they can create a new identity in a database ( they would have to hack a national database , forgers usually do n't do things like this ) . 
  it seems that we have to invest in poorer countries , so they can catch up with this ( pretty cheap ) technology . 
  and by us i mean usa , eu , japan and other richer countries . 
  there are also refugees , we took in couple families with polish heritage from donbas . 
  we always had a special mass before the first day of school , but it was volutary . 
  pretty much everyone attended it , but it was a normal mass with intention of a good year in school , it did n't look so crowded ( because , you know , churches are usually pretty big here ) , in catholic church there 's also a lot less kneeling . 
  and we sit a lot . 
  saying that enlightenment `` stopped the rot '' is , well , enlightenment 's propaganda . 
  sure , reforms of the church were gradual , nothing has happened overnight . 
  secular/religious divide is in the bible and it was strengthened by concordat of worms and lateranum . 
  other great innovations were brought by people like pawe\u0142 w\u0142odkowic , who , thanks to the existence of universities throughout europe , could engage in disputes with other scholars on things like secular human rights . 
  and it was early 15th century . 
  as / u/eighthgear says - enlightement itself was rotten from the very beginning . 
  look at the horrors of french revolution and secular/atheist regimes of 20th century . 
  i 'm not saying that some men of the church did n't commit terrible crimes , there were a lot of awful people that hid behind the facade of religion , that 's true . 
  but it 's not fair to jump from religious wars and inquisition right into enlightement , overlooking the evolution of ideas which was possible because of the fact that disputes in the church were encouraged . 
  and the most important events in the history of christianity , which allowed it to gain this discoursive nature , were the new covenant and teachings of st. paul . 
  thanks to them christians do n't have to follow the rules of ancient jews ( which were often pretty logical , considering that they were living on a desert in pretty tough enviroment , surrounded by other tribes ) . 
  muslims did n't have st. paul and the new covenant , so the rules of tribesmen of arabia still apply to them , even though there is no need to use sanctions like chopping off a hand . 
  it makes islam less adaptable than christianity . 
  well , it 's perfectly legal and understandable . 
  rich countries invest in poor countries and to some extent drain them economically ( it 's not that one sided - they have money to invest , so they employ many people , but that 's not a charity - it 's bussines as usual , they get as much as they can from it ) . 
  the same goes for economic migrants from poor countries - they do so to help themselves and their families . 
  they 're not some kind of world aid , they earn that money - they can support themselves in the host country and send some for their families , good for them . 
  in poland it 's quite difficult to own a gun . 
  but if you want to go to a shooting range , you just call them , make an appointment , sign a document and you can shoot as much as you want . 
  they 'll ask you if you know the safety rules , if you say that you do , they 'll probably wo n't even bother . 
  and your guns are awesome !, 
  i miuch more prefer cz 75 to , for example , glock . 
  the best example of how fucked up it was is [ szkieletor ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/szkieletor_in_krakow.jpg ) in krak\u00f3w . 
  they began building it in late 70s right before they ran out of money . 
  every year or so there are rumours about it getting finished , actually there are some investments in this area ( they 've cleared are around it ) , so i hope the new investor will do something with it . 
  wow , that 's a revisionist bullshit if i 've seen one . 
  brd agreed on the oder-neisse border in 1970 ( [ warschauer vertrag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_warsaw_ ( 1970 ) ) . 
  ddr did so in 1950 . 
  germans ( and russian collaborants from rona ) were also pretty efficient during wola massacre : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wola_massacre it was the biggest single civilian massacre during the war ( nanking was bigger , but usually we do n't consider that war a part of 2nd ww ) . 
  `` only '' 40 000-60 000 deaths , but it took them a week . 
  on black saturday they killed 20 000 - 45 000 people . 
  in ** one day !, 
  ** nanking massacre lasted for a month . 
  we 're way beyond internal/external politics dychotomy , mate . 
  european politics is a third dimension you have to consider . 
  and poland . 
   feel free to provide a source for that . 
  only thing i read about those `` threats '' are from western media throwing blanket accusations with nothing to back them up .

  it 's an official document . 
   im yet to see them use gas as a political tool even once .

  because ukrainians choose poland and germany . 
  first for cultural reasons , second for uros . 
   so with the quota you get some of them and register them in your country and urge them to stay in the country . 
  when they are found in another country later on they will get deported back because they are registered . 
  the thing is - it 's not happening atm . 
  hungary got bashed by liberal media , because they wanted to register refugees ( thing that greece did n't do , because they wanted to get rid of the problem and allowed them to pass through their country - and they 're hard to blame , because they have their own problems ) . 
  look at calais - hundreds of people that are in a safe country , but they try to get to the uk . 
  i agree to what you 've written , the problem is , those rules are n't enforced . 
  they should be registered , put in safe places ( refugee camps etc. 
  ) , economic migrants that got here illegaly should be shipped back to their countries and so on . 
  but last year shows us that it 's not going to happen and every effort in enforcing the law ends in blaming those who tried of being nazis . 
  two issues . 
  merkel and a lot of german political elites are being irresponsible with `` inviting refugees '' on two levels ( let 's not dwelve if they indeed `` invited '' refugees , it 's irrelevant ) : a ) encouraging people to migrate en masse to germany only increases amount of people that will do so . 
  eventually smugglers will even lower the price , so more and more people could afford to be transported/smuggled . 
  this lead to even more deaths in the process of migration . 
  b ) the same encouragement is not only german burden , but european burden . 
  we are being forced to distribute them in europe ( which , in theory , is n't such a bad idea ) . 
  irresponsibility of german leaders threatens our union . 
  if it was agreed on , there would be no problem - people would be displeased , but some decisions will always be unpopular .
