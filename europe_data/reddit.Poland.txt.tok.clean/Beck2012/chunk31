  but inviting immigrants/refugees without consulting other countries - especially those that are in between , like bulgaria , hungary , czechia and slovakia , is dangerous as a factor weakening the union . 
  the second issue - distributing economic migrants is out of question . 
  if someone is an economic migrant , he/she should register in his country in an eu member state embasssy and come here legally . 
  any person that is found on the territory of the eu that is an economic migrant and do not have proper paperwork should be deported asap . 
  only refugees should be distributed and housed by the eu . 
  but again - if they come here illegaly , they should n't be treated differently than , let 's say , ukrainian fleeing donbas . 
  if someone want to apply for a refugee status , he should be able to do so in a refugee camp in lebanon , turkey , etc. 
  and we should make it possible for them to do so . 
  if they get to the eu illegaly - tough luck , they have to be deported . 
  we have to be in control of this situation . 
  and we have to help refugees but in orderly manner , current situation is a chutzpah . 
  one more thing - we have schengen , so refugees housed in any country that is n't germany , uk or sweden , will try to flee to one of those countries . 
  and we have examples of that already . 
  and we allow jews to get their property back . 
  and you think that immigrants read her german sentence ? 
  if / r/europe thinks that merkel invited immigrants , so do said immigrants ( and for sure they 're told so by smugglers , who are getting filthy rich in the process ) . 
  politics is n't about what someone has said , but what others have heard . 
  russians stopped supplying us with petroleum in early 1990s ( but we got it from diffrent sources and after that we get most of our petroleum from russia , tankers are pretty useful to avoid this threat ) . 
  before we joined eu , it was one of the biggest problems - russia threatened cutting gas deliveries on a yearly basis . 
  and yes , we 're getting independent , we have pretty big gas reserves in case of emergency and alternative sources of gas were one of the biggest investments in the last years . 
  we 're not whining . 
  we 're opposing russo-german cooperation above our heads . 
  russia is a rogue state that uses gas a tool in a political war against the west and in defending their `` sphere of influence '' . 
  as i 've written above - poland has means to be independent from russian supply of gas . 
  other countries do n't , it 's a huge investment and you have to have an access to a sea , to have even a chance to be independent . 
  a lot of countries in censtral and eastern europe need our support and solidarity in this case . 
  even our closest friends in v4 are almost 100 % reliant on russia . 
  gas is not an easily transported commodity . 
  we ca n't just get gas from me and na . 
  as i 've said , we 're finishing building lng port . 
  gas we 're going to get through it will be more expensive than russian gas , but we 're doing it for safety reasons . 
  in the same time , our own production and import via lpg terminal wo n't cover our needs . 
  talking about `` russia being a reliable partner to the western europe '' and not to the eastern is the reason why we 're trying to oppose this idea . 
  expanding nordstream weakens european union and strengthens russia . 
  poland will manage , we have the least problem with it , we 're a big country that adapts . 
  but slovakia does n't have any choice . 
  the same goes for ukraine , which is being invaded by russia atm . 
  we need more solidarity and nordstream 2 is n't helping with that . 
  yamal has nothing to do with nordstream , it 's the old pipe that comes to us directly from russia -  [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/major_russian_gas_pipelines_to_europe.png ) . 
  we can get gas from germany , because we have built interconnectors . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's russian gas ( i doubt it ) . 
  why should poland pay israel anything ? 
  germans butchered both catholic poles and jewish poles during ww2 and we 're supposed to pay anything to israel ? 
  we were the object of genocide together with them !, 
  stop spreading lies about polish resposibility for holocaust !, 
  mate , you 're wrong . 
  with nordstream russians can terrorize every country between them and germany . 
  when pipes are on our territory they ca n't , because if they try , we can shut them , so germans wo n't get their gas . 
  nordstream allows them to spread bullshit lies about `` bad condition of pipes '' and stopping the gas transfer in the winter season . 
  it ltierally allows russians to freeze us to death . 
  and energetic terror is one of two main strategies of russia since early 90s - the other one is food embargoes . 
  as for russian gas in poland - in the last ten years we 've tried to make ourselves independent from russian gas . 
  our lpg terminal should be opened in december , we buy less and less gas from ruskies , gas is mainly used by industry , in new houses gas installations are a rare sight . 
  our energetic sector is dominated by coal , not gas . 
  drunk people tend to get violent if they 're in a group and got drunk on hard liquor . 
  nothing unusual with that , if you went to a pub and got drunk drinking beer , you 'd be friends with everyone . 
  western commonwealth . 
  in polish both the maintenance fees and rent are usually called `` czynsz '' . 
  nowadays we call the first one `` czynsz '' and the second one `` op\u0142ata najmu '' ( `` renting fee '' ) . 
  and yeah , you can get a 50 sq m flat for 300 euro , `` czynsz '' is usually around 30-50 euro . 
  it depends on city/location etc. 
  prices vary . 
  croatia is a gem . 
  really - small , amazing country . 
  and they 're catholic , which is a plus . 
  plitvice are one of the prettiest places i 've been to and i travel a lot . 
  they 're the third biggest contributor of humanitarian aid to the refugees . 
  ** germany is an 80 milion people country and has spent 130 milion pounds less than 3.2 million kuweit ** . 
  they are a good influence and they act smart , trying to help refugees in refugee camps .

  * \u0141\u0105cko is a slivovitz capital of poland, 
  rocket scientist . 
  i fight them with bear hands . 
  korwin-mikke is pro-russian because no one else is . 
  that 's his idiotic `` strategy '' - he has said that he 's not interested in pleasing 90 % people , he wants the support of the remaining 10 % that do n't get representation ( because of their misguided views , i 'd say ) . 
  he 's not pro-russian , he 's just cynical . 
  swet , old racist . 
  just like our beloved jkm . 
  i think that one in two men in poland has voted for him at least once . 
  the other half realized that he 's insane before they could vote . 
  do not bundle all those countries together !, 
  there is big difference between saudi arabia and qatar , which funds isis and other jihadist groups , and kuwait . 
  little kuwait has spent more than germany to help refugees : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war, 
  there are mass graves/bodies of muslim refugees ( rohingya ) found all over perlis , kelantan and kedah . 
  the same goes for thailand - thai traffickers are n't known for being very delicate , so the chance you 'll find some bodies in southern states are pretty high . 
  http://borneobulletin.com.bn/malaysia-buries-rohingya-human-trafficking-victims-in-kedah/ http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/rohingya-refugees-gang-raped-thailand-malaysia-camps-1503951 http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/14/asia/malaysia-indonesia-rohingya-migrants/ as for migrants from philippines , afaik they accept only women . 
  they say that they need maids and philippine women are good at it . 
  japan wo n't accept migrants , they 're incredibly closed society and veeery xenophobic and racist . 
  if you 're white , you 'll be allright . 
  but darker skin colour , or even being korean will mean you 'll be treated like garbage ( this korean thing is getting better because of hallyu , but it 's still pretty bad ) . 
  there was no mention of changing the source . 
  the only clear option was voting `` yes '' ( which i would choose if i 've went to the ballot , unfortunately i could n't ) - nothing changes . 
  if you choose `` no '' , every change would be considered as valid . 
  so it could be e.g. 
  a change of the lower bar of support in an election needed to receive public funding ( from 3 % to 5 % ) . 
  or disallowing any private funding . 
  they could do virtually anything with this and it would be legal . 
  utekat sounds like polish ucieka\u0107 , which means `` to flee , to run away '' . 
  uciekinier in polish is a fugitive . 
  national id is enough .
