  they 're also ignorant and condescending . 
  and they ca n't drive . 
  well , no . 
  there are modern fire preventing measures . 
  there churches in ma\u0142opolskie which are equiped with them . 
  [ that 's the spot ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/place/miejsce+pami%c4%99ci+i+muzeum+auschwitz-birkenau/@50.0275717,19.2014669,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s-taegjrlosac%2fvviv4jdjxui%2faaaaaaaayla%2fmac62z1xuns!2e4!3e12!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-taegjrlosac%2fvviv4jdjxui%2faaaaaaaayla%2fmac62z1xuns%2fs203-k-no%2f!7i3840!8i2160!4m2!3m1!1s0x4716be32014dffa1:0xe8e173d6821a53c5!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  / u/wordyf , google maps location you 've provided does n't show the same building . 
  yeah , they 're all brick , like a lot of buildings in poland . 
  they 're in ekstraklasa . 
  basketball - it 's not that popular in poland ( i mean , everybody plays it at school , but the following of professional baskeball is pretty low ), 
  i 've been on a poland-netherlands match few years ago and we 've kicked their asses . 
  for few seasons i 've attended juvenia krak\u00f3w matches , but they suck so hard , it was painful to watch ( seriously , guys were too exhausted after 20 minutes to do anything on the field , enough to say , they 've struggled and even fell to the 2nd league for some time ) . 
  now it 's a bit better , they 're back in the 1st league and are not in the last place !, 
  the best teams are from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and tricity ( gda\u0144sk , sopot and gdynia have their own 1st league teams , with arka gdynia being the best ) . 
  i hoped it was about cheese smugglers from kaliningrad . 
  yep , commies were comparable only to isis in terms of not even stealing , but destroying art and cultural heritage . 
  that 's what happened to krasiczyn castle , one of the most magnificent mannerist castles ever built :  in late 1941 , after german invasion of soviet union , andrzej sapieha returned to the castle , which had been used as barracks for soldiers of the red army ( see molotov line ) . 
  this is his account of the premises : `` on the floors there is garbage , old clothes , destroyed books . 
  walls full of soviet propaganda posters , no furniture , instead of it , wooden beds everywhere . 
  the chapel is completely ruined , all sculptures on the walls destroyed as high as the savages could reach . 
  altars and pews destroyed . 
  all three monuments have disappeared . 
  the church in a terrible state , as it had been used as stables and a butcher shop . 
  metal coffins were used by the bolsheviks as bathtubs '' . 
  they stole brass dorrknobs from my granmas house , because they thought it was gold . 
  and they ate out of wc , because they thought it was a soup bowl . 
  nice , me too . 
  just ate a p\u0105czek and am going to learn chinese and civil procedure , because i have exams in few days . 
  i 'm also following what 's going on in malaysia ( bersih 4.0 , big protest against corruption and voting frauds : https://www.reddit.com/live/vhhwrniap7tp ) . 
  concentration camps -  `` polish concentration camps '' -  because they 're in poland !, 
  `` gold train '' -  `` nazi gold train '' -  because that part of poland was german before 1945 !, 
  yep . 
  album from krak\u00f3w : http://lovekrakow.pl/galeria/kamienice-przy-dietla-pieknieja-zdjecia_2061.html and dietla used to be one of the ugliest streets in the city ( even a year ago ) , now it 's starting to look good . 
  a bit too much hobos ( there are several places that help them there , like st. 
  brother albert 's kitchen and municipal social help centre ) . 
  exactly , it 's historic . 
  why should a 45 year episode of our history , that has ended 25 years ago , be more important than 1 000 years of our history . 
  indeed . 
  i think it was kisiel who said that polish independence will be sure only when us soldiers will be here permanently . 
  we never aimed to be part of the east , nor do we now . 
  we 're happy to be part of the west , as we 've always been . 
   hungarian beer used to suck , now soproni and dreher or borsodi are kinda drinkable umm ... no , they are n't . 
  i love hungarian cusine , your wines are really , really great ( cheap tokaj furmint on a sunny day is great ) ... 
  but beers are close to undrinkable . 
  soproni and borsodi are bad , but still stand out as better than most of your beers . 
  and considering heineken more prestigious , well ... 
  no , we do n't . 
   4l of beer per week hm , that 's almost a pint a day , that 's not that much . 
   i am not 18 yet oh . 
  i like you . 
  brits have got some kind of `` drop pants mechanism '' , which activates after four pints . 
  they have to show their arses , there is no other option . 
  i 've never seen anyone running without trousers but brits . 
  [ :| ] ( http://001yourtranslationservice.com/travel-europe/country-links/czech-republic/prague/images/grumpy-face/czech-personality-2.jpg ), 
  he was n't destroying anything . 
  the refrigerator itself was probably installed improperly , i 've never seen any refrigerator move like a rocking chair . 
  nah , it was covered on / r/europe . 
  i understood it pretty well . 
  it sound very monty pyton-esque . 
  and those were more of political , not religious issues . 
  hell , in poland persecutions of protestants began in late 17th century , after they 've supported sweden during the deluge . 
  for over 150 years there was religious peace , but protestants of commonwealth decided to align themselves with an enemy , that 's when pole-catholic stereotype began , before that we were pretty diverse society in terms of religion . 
  i think that the case of christianity in china alone makes it the most persecuted religion in the world . 
  and then you add other communist countries ( especially north korea and laos ) , 90 % of muslim countries ( even in malaysia christians are to some extent persecuted ) ... 
  sure , we need more v4 . 
  we should also think of expanding into v4 +3 ( baltci states ) or v4 +2 ( romania and bulgaria ) . 
  handling the migrant crisis independently from the eu would be great idea . 
  exactly . 
  why eating whale meat should be condemned while eating pork is not ( and in every instance it 's condemned , is because `` pigs are dirty and pork is unhealthy '' ) . 
  and why the fuck should anyone `` adapt '' ? 
  because it 's not visually pleasing ? 
  faroese people are not whaling for profit like some elephant poachers . 
  they do so , because it 's a good source of energy . 
  the same way potato and pork are good sources of energy in mainland europe , and rice and shrimps are in other parts of the world . 
  yeah , it 's better to use an interpreter than do [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/g45obllpvsu?t=13s ) and be a butt of a joke . 
  and we do use bilingual streetnames in poland . 
  that 's what pisses us off , and we have the same problem with germans refusing to call poles a minority in germany ( fun fact , it was revoked in 1939 by nazis ) . 
  damn , i was sure this thread will be about a person who was addicted to [ milo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m3x0okv.gif ) and could n't find it here ( or [ those ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qh52hep.jpg ) , even better , they taste like maltesers ) . 
  sorry for that , mate . 
  montenegro is smaller than krak\u00f3w , til . 
  i hope your country will overcome its problems , good luck !, 
  fuckers at paris airport took my mustard and jam . 
  since fucking when mustard and jam are liquids , or are dangerous . 
  okay , i imagine i could use mustard to blind the crew ( [ eyes are especially sensitive to the effects of mustard ] ( http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=198757 ) ) but what harm i could cause with a small jar of fig jam ?!, 
  [ for polish speakers ] ( https://youtu.be/swhxccqn3zo?t=6m16s ) . 
  yeah , african immigrants we had ( mostly highlt educated people from libya , nigeria and egypt ) were fine . 
  people that were westernized even before they came here are okay . 
  but now we face a large scale migration of poor people that were brought up in tribal societies wehre slavery still exists . 
  they do n't know any better and they will take their beliefs and views with them . 
  kwas chlebowy if you prefer polish name . 
  czech cinema is cool . 
  * knofl\u00edk\u00e1\u0159i * or * buttoners * [ imdb  ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128292/ )  twist of fate and the twists of mind of the characters ( mostly couples ) combine in just the right twinkled absurd way in the interweaving episodes of this comedy . 
  each of the characters gets a good shot at being sarcastic and each is a sorry loser at some point yet none is turned into the butt of the joke . 
  the place is prague and the time is august 6th , 1995 , except for one episode , set 50 years earlier in unflyable rain in the city of kokura , japan . 
  and yeah , the title matters . 
  :-d * tmavomodry svet * or * dark blue world * [ imdb ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244479/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2 ) :  march 15 , 1939 : germany invades czechoslovakia .
