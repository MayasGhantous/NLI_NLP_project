  she spends one night with karel , and he thinks he 's found the love of his life . 
  it 's complicated by susan 's attraction to franta . 
  how will the three handle innocence , eros , friendship , and the heat of battle ? 
  when war ends , what then ? 
  from a review on imdb :  but the element of `` dark blue world '' that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects , especially during combat ( and this is a good thing ! ) . 
  while the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them , no manipulative shots of worried spouses/girlfriends were interwoven , every little aerial maneuver did not elicit trite patriotic cheers , and viewers were n't asked to swallow unbelievable james bond-esque pilot heroics . 
  instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy , fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay aloft during combat . 
  yeah , traditionally we 're more of kasza people . 
  let 's hope that christmas europe will follow . 
  video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hwd8sb2spo&amp;ab_channel=cnn, 
  this . 
  guys , stop bashing on a bloke , who just saw such a tragic incident . 
  he was n't laughing at all , his adrenaline levels were high , he was clearly in shock . 
  even if he would laugh out loud ( which he did n't do ! ), 
  it would probably be a natural reaction , without any ill intent . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyfro8w578k&amp;ab_channel=vk.com/ukraineatamanspro ) . 
   do rzeczy is very pro-pis i 'd say they 're more anti-po than pro-pis . 
  ziemkiewicz openly supported ruch narodowy , they published kukiz etc. 
  they are definetely more fiscally conservative than pis , that 's for sure . 
  `` w sieci '' is very pro-pis , to the degree i ( while supporting zjednoczona prawica , especially gowin ) can not read them . 
  not to mention gazeta polska , which is basically a party bulletin . 
  and i would n't call radio maryja et consortes extremist . 
  they 're aimed at really devout catholics and some of the people that work there are taken straight from 19th century , but they 're harmless . 
  and you have n't mentioned two bigest weeklies we have . 
  `` angora '' , which is mix of low brow humour and reprints from newspapers , and `` go\u015b\u0107 niedzielny '' ( `` sunday guest '' ) which is pretty much mainstream jp2 catholic weekly . 
  tvn24 is unwatchable . 
  tvn24bi\u015a is okay , mainly because they hire young people and do n't talk much about polish politics . 
  tv republika is biased as fuck , but there is a handful of programs that i enjoy ( i like ziemkiewicz and gociek ) . 
  polsat news is surprisingly neutral and they 've got pretty good programs . 
  but i can not watch their main news - it 's all about rapes , pedophiles , murders and so on . 
  that 's so russian . 
   japan etc then they have apologised for their past aggressions lol . 
  nope , they did n't . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nanking_massacre#denials_of_the_massacre_by_public_officials_in_japan even more fucked up is the comfort women issue :  in 2007 , the surviving sex slaves wanted an apology from the japanese government . 
  shinz\u014d abe , the prime minister at the time , stated on march 1 , 2007 , that there was no evidence that the japanese government had kept sex slaves , even though the japanese government had already admitted the use of coercion in 1993 . 
  on march 27 the japanese parliament issued an official apology . 
  [ 108 ] on february 20 , 2014 , chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said that the japanese government may reconsider the study and the apology . 
  [ 109 ] however , prime minister abe clarified on march 14 , 2014 that he had no intention of renouncing or altering it . 
  no my friend , ** let 's dwell on the past ** !, 
  at least one event is worth mentioning , massacre of praga ( praga is now a part of warsaw ) , which happened after the [ battle of praga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_praga ) in 1795 . 
   almost all of the area was pillaged and inhabitants of the praga district were tortured , raped and murdered . 
  the exact death toll of that day remains unknown , but it is estimated that up to 20,000 people were killed . 
  suvorov himself wrote : `` the whole of praga was strewn with dead bodies , blood was flowing in streams . '', 
  one more - during warsaw uprising stalin has stopped the red army from advancing and refused any help to our boys and girls . 
  he send 2 500 polish soldiers from berling 's army to help the ressistance , but it was a suicide mission and its aim was to avoid uprising 's capitulation , which would happen much sooner , if not for stalin 's lies about helping poles in this heroic battle . 
  edit : oh , i almost forgot , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_ ( 1937 % e2 % 80 % 9338 ), 
  he looks like a cartoon villain . 
   csi : diy, 
  great tv . 
  as for poland ... `` czterdziestolatek '' was a fun show . 
  there 's even [ polish made moomins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytmgjj485a0&amp;ab_channel=muminkitv ) , tbh til . 
  apparently it 's closer to tove janson version . 
  read about new covenant , mate . 
  all those stonings etc. 
  never were a part of christian faith , because we do not abide to jewish laws . 
  read st. paul 's letters . 
  even in old testament there is a mention of new covenant ( ezechiel ) . 
  yiddish . 
  chrzciciel is also nice . 
  `` race of racing racers '' . 
  and `` wy\u015bcign\u0119\u0142a '' sounds stupid to me ( like something a kid would say ) and it means to overtake . 
  the second one about '' \u017cy\u0142a '' is really clever . 
  `` there lived a vein and in this vein lived a vein , when this vein 's vein broke , this vein did n't live any longer '', 
  tbh that 's great news and a a surprise . 
  people were wondering if he 'll go to berlin , brussels , kiev or just wait for un general assembly and go to new york . 
  but nope , tallin . 
  what 's important is the fact that he 'll do it on an anniversary of ribbentrop-molotov pact . 
  he 's serious about strengthening nato 's east flank and that 's wonderful . 
  i 'm hopeful for his presidency . 
  where the fuck do you live ? 
  my current 34 sq. 
  meter flat costed 300 000 pln ( without furnishing and parking space , the latter was 20k ( or 30k , i 'm not sure ) pln ) . 
  meter house in a part of town without good public transportation [ link ] ( http://www.gumtree.pl/a-mieszkania-i-domy-sprzedam-i-kupie/krak%c3%b3w/krakow-olsza+-dom-jedno-dwurodzinny/1001394742460910468414609 ) , for less than 300 000 usd you can get a nice flat in a new building . 
  my mum just bought a 50 sq meter flat for less than a half that price . 
  yo , they 're really tasty , that 's all . 
  polish pabst . 
  still above avarage as an international lager ( tbh you must really try to buy truly bad beer in poland , avarage cheap beer will be better than bud or foster 's ) . 
  best food ever . 
  i 'm not a w\u00f3dka drinker , but i wo n't say no to good cytryn\u00f3wka ( lemon infused w\u00f3dka ) . 
  soft drink - good kompot ( i 'm drinking one right now ! ) . 
  as for food - steak tartare for breakfast , bigos t for dinner and kanapki with pol\u0119dwica \u0142ososiowa ( or hungarian salami !, 
  yeah , we have a `` thing '' for plane crash controversies : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_sikorski%27s_death_controversy tbh i do n't believe that russians shot down our presidential plane , but it would n't be a shock for me , if it was true . 
  of what ? 
  8/10 asians will confuse us with `` holland '' . 
  not because we say it wrong ... 
  yes , it would be genocide . 
  but tutsi were a social class , not an ethnicity . 
  according to your theory , if germany would kill all turks on its soil , it would n't be a genocide , because there would be more than 50 % turks left alive . 
  in turkey . 
  he did n't say that . 
  polish operation 's aim was to kill as many poles as possible . 
  soviets killed not only poles with ussr citizenship , but also citizens of poland that happened to be in the ussr at that time ( immigrants and pows ) . 
  yeah , you might be right . 
  i 've used wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_operations_of_the_nkvd and polish wikipedia , i think the number of 700 000 victims appears somwhere there . 
  but this article : http://www.massviolence.org/the-nkvd-mass-secret-national-operations-august-1937?cs=print states the same number of victims as you . 
   according to the state security central authorities ' accountancy , over 335,000 persons were sentenced in the course of the national operations . 
  the largest contingent ( 140,000 ) was trapped in the polish operation . 
  out of this number , 111,000 ( or 79 % ) were executed . 
  some 55,000 were sentenced under order n \u00b0 00439 ( the german operation ) , 76 % of whom ( or 42,000 persons ) were executed . 
  another quote :  according to n. okhotin and a. roginski , poles and soviet citizens of polish origin represented about 70 % of the 140,000 persons sentenced under order n \u00b0 00485 ( that is 98,000 persons ) .
