  altogether , during the great terror , approximately 120,000 poles and soviet citizens of polish origin were arrested and sentenced . 
  with one-fifth of its total group repressed , soviet citizens of polish origin paid the heaviest toll of all ethnic minorities forming the `` great soviet family '' i think that , for the sake of remembrance , an exact number of people murdered by bolsheviks ( nkvd was , especially under iron felix , an multi-ethnic organization , so saying that russians were responsible would be an error ) is not that important . 
  what matters is the fact , that it was an ethnic clensening of unfathomable scale . 
  edit : i think that the higher number might be a sum of minority people executed under national operations orders and other great terror orders . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.umu.se/digitalassets/58/58916_workshop_programme__baltic_and_arctic_areas_under_stalin.pdf ) workshop programme states a number of almost 250 000 people from northern/baltic minorities . 
  ever heard of discussion ? 
  it 's time to focus more on small bussiness and less on fdis . 
  we have to take another step in developing our economy , times of `` cheap polish labour '' are coming to an end . 
  we have to do something else , or we 'll end up in a middle income trap . 
  it 's important to remember that genocide ( s ) carried out by bolsheviks were based not only on social ( or class , if you will ) status but also ethnicity . 
  there were : 1 . 
  german operation - `` sentencing of at least 55005 persons including 41898 sentenced to death '' 2 . 
  romanian operation of the nkvd 3 . 
  finnish operation of the nkvd 4 . 
  latvian operation of the nkvd 5 . 
  ukrainian operation of the nkvd 6 . 
  greek operation ( 50 000 ~ ~ koreans ~ ~ greeks affected , 10 % of total greek population in the ussr ) . 
  korean operation there were also other national operations . 
  polish operation was by far the largest . 
  it 's estimated that ** 1.5 million people were affected and almost half of them ( 700 000 ) were executed by shooting ** . 
  hungarians were helping poland in 1939 - despite being allied with germany . 
  they refused to attack us and invited over 100 000 civilians and helped transport 35 000 polish troops to france . 
  polish embassy in budapest was open till late 1940 , a year after we lost . 
  hungarian troops alerted polish resistance of incoming germans during the warsaw uprising and refused to fight us . 
  despite being on the wrong side of the barrickade . 
  there were instances when hungarian troops gave our ressistance food and weapons . 
  there were negotiations between hungarians and poles to help hungarians switch sides in 1944 - hungarians offered that 20 000 soldiers that were stationed in poland would help poles fight germans . 
  unfortunately , germans found out about it and called off all hugnarian troops from polish territory . 
  more has grown . 
  [ ** i 've made a map !, 
  ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6acwnxk.jpg ) edit : i did n't even notice - yugo stronk . 
  i like how duda 's opponents were wrong all the time aobut his chances for election . 
  keep up your propheting work , it 's flawless . 
  it 's our daily life . 
  you know why ? 
  because we did n't have enough time to grief and most of events that are celebrated now , were n't during communist regime . 
  wola massacre was n't a fact known to the public , celebrating katy\u0144 might lead you to jail etc. 
  wikipedia :  professor timothy snyder , of yale university , wrote that `` the massacres in wola had nothing in common with combat '' as `` the ratio of civilian to military dead was more than a thousand to one , even if military casualties on both sides are counted '' . 
  captured insurgents shall be killed whether or not they fight in accordance with the hague convention . 
  the non-fighting part of the population , women , children , shall also be killed . 
  the whole city shall be razed to the ground , i.e. 
  its buildings , streets , facilities , and everything within its borders . 
  czechoslovakia took this land from poland in 1919 , when poland was fighting bolsheviks . 
  i 'd say we 're even . 
  yeah , there is quite big polish community there . 
  this map is also wrong with showing ukrainian speakers in se poland - they were dislpaced by commies during `` action vistula '' in 1940s . 
  there are a lot of ukrainians in poland , but they live in cities and blend in pretty easily . 
  they were probalby cannibalized for other purposes . 
  we can share mi\u0142osz , mickiewicz etc. 
  i do n't care what language you speak , we 're all brothers within former commonwealth . 
  if you 're on a tight budget you should go to poland , it 's much cheaper than germany . 
  although - warsaw is the most expensive polish city , krak\u00f3w is a lot cheaper . 
  cost : 1 600k usd . 
  funded by parish and business ' from poland and chicago ( aka second poland ) . 
  no , it should n't . 
  our antionalities and countries shape who we are and how we think . 
  feeling a pride ( not a chauvinism ! ), 
  of our ancestors , land , culture and land is perfectly normal and healthy . 
  i like being a pole and well-being , and prosperity of my country makes me more prosperous and helps me being a better person . 
  does it ? 
  in polish `` czu\u0107 '' means both to feel a scent and to feel an object , is n't it the same in lithuanian ? 
  and we were just free after 120 years of non-existence . 
  with three diffrent currencies , diffrent rail tracks , hell a large portion of our country drove on the left side of a road . 
  we were n't in tip-top shape . 
  we also fought germans , ukrainians and czechs in the same time . 
  you 've mixed the first one . 
  with germans it 's only bussiness , shooting russians is a national sport . 
  \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435 sounds like polish `` krocze '' , which means , well , `` crotch '' ... 
  yeah , his name appears in our `` tape scandal/waitergate '' . 
  radek sikorski was supposed to lobby specifically for him and wanted to be a member of european commission in charge of energy affairs , to handle kulczyk 's affairs in ukraine . 
  so yeah . 
  also , kulczyk 's daughter was supposed to have sex with member of current ruling party . 
  in a restaurant , where all those wiretaps were set . 
  probably most of vws and bmws are second-hand . 
  sweden is throwing granades . 
  yeah , i did . 
  it was late and a third beer ... my bad . 
  hate to break it to y' all but it 's ** editorializing ** . 
  rule 2.3 . forbids it . 
  stop breeching the rules , or i 'll have to call the reddit rangers . 
  i think that sending men might be more justified economically ( they will be able to find work as a labourer and send money home - uneducated woman who does n't know language wo n't be able to do so ) and socially ( in their culture men are valued more , so they 're a prioritized ) . 
  it 's 6 feet . 
  and it means you 're an ant . 
  most of our cheesees are either `` netherland style '' or `` swiss style '' - we had a lot of immigrants from netherlands in 17th century . 
  most popular cheeses are : gouda , edam , emmentaler , [ tilsiter/tyl \u017cycki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tilsit_cheese ) , maasdamer . 
  and other , newer types ( ba\u0142tycki , rolada ustrzycka , etc. ) . 
  they 're all good and tasty . 
  apart from that we 've got oscypek , which was mentioned above . 
  there is smoked and unsmoked version . 
  it can contain max . 
  40 % of cow milk , which may come only from [ polish red ] ( http://www.wigry.org.pl/15lat/rolnictwo6.jpg ) , most popular cow in our mountains . 
  other cheeses made out of sheep milk are bundz ( my fav , something in between mozzarella and quark ) , bryndza ( very salty soft cheese ) and korbacze/korboce ( strings of smoked cheese , looks like braided hair ) . 
  you 're a democracy , they 're a dictatorship and pose a real military threat . 
  also bmw  \u0141ada, 
  it 's the only station that 's not controlled by lukashenko . 
  it 's worth funding even if it 's range and viewership are small ( it 's worth for a country to have an alternate source of information and journalists that are not blindly obeying government ) . 
  / u/muncher32 is ( or at least it seems so , after reading his posts ) quite pro-russian , so it 's only natural for him to dislike belsat ( sorry if it 's a generalization ) . 
  it 's a type of white cheese . 
  it 's also not a cottage cheese , two diffrent things . 
  we already fund belsat , which is a tv station for belarussians .
