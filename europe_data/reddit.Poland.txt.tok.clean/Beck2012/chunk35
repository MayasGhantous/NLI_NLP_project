  it sounds similar . 
  there are people that ca n't tell taiwan and thailand apart . 
  or taiwan and prc . 
  that 's nothing . 
  one time when i was in bangkok i 've talked to some young thais , they were on a vacation and came from a province ( do n't remember which , i 'd say somewhere in issan ) . 
  i told them that me and my mate were polish . 
  you 're police !, 
  we police !, 
  we drink ! ', 
  we did n't manage to explain them that we 're not policemen , but polish and we came from poland , not policeland . 
  they bought us drinks and talked out of some troubles with real policemen ( well , we were in bangkok , it was really late and few days before the last coup ) . 
  it should n't be red , terrorist attacks in souther thailand are rare and not that deadly . 
  tunisia is far more dangerous for western tourists than e.g. 
  and our economy was ruined by military junta in the 1980s . 
  that 's still pretty silli . 
  oh god , telepizza in poland is really , really bad . 
  it depends on a restaurant . 
  the one i sometimes eat at is fine , they 've got fresh veggies all the time . 
  there are still people in western europe that prefer josip broz and khrushchev ... 
  language is a part of national identity . 
  if you want integration , you have to accept it and show some respect , especially for smaller countries like malta , which culture might be more easily dominated by larger countries . 
  [ guys !, 
  guys !, 
  he 's so euphoric , is n't he ? 
  in polish bribe is called '' \u0142ap\u00f3wka '' - '' \u0142apa '' means `` a paw '' . 
  so it 's some kind of paw/hand thing . 
  we sometimes say `` da\u0107 w \u0142ap\u0119 '' , `` to give to a paw '' when we say about giving a bribe . 
  `` this politician got to [ his ] paw '' means that this politian got a bribe . 
  they got it from turkish , but the word itself is from farsi . 
  http://i.imgur.com/pwirtgh.jpg - it says `` the beating heart of party '' and `` all steam ahead to socialism '' below . 
  also , zomo was called `` bij\u0105ce serce partii '' . 
  - `` imperialistic enemy is tempting you with coca-cola . '', 
  - `` joseph v. stalin - father of all polish children . '', 
  - `` our answer to speculators is delivering potatoes on time ! '', 
  i personally like : `` usta stalina s\u0142odkie jak malina '' ( it rhymes in polish ) - `` stalin 's lips , sweet as a rapsberry '' . 
  also , the most glorious one : [ after a finished work - put on briefs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/spqcgxz.jpg ) . 
  nope , there were no polish , nor jewish ss troops . 
  it 's easy to win having loans from ebrd -  http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/lidl-1bn-public-development-funding-supermarket-world-bank-eastern-europe, 
  you sure like cows . 
  and krtek . 
  source : http://pikio.pl/uchodzcy-o-polskim-osrodku-tu-jest-panstwo-islamskie/ they 're harrasing refugees from ukraine and georgia , tell women to dress `` modest '' and say that the rules of islamic state apply to the refugee camp , because muslims live there . 
  step 5 ' : drunk british tourists running around pantless . 
  so you 're not iguanas , you 're ugandans ? 
  hehe , you 'll have a good time . 
  remember not to drink store-bought beer ( or any alcohol ) on streets or in parks . 
  if you do , you 'll probably pay a fine . 
  but beer in pubs costs from 1,20 euro ( cheap pub , there are some near main square that serve beer for 5-6 zlotys , which is 1,30-1 ,60 euros ) to 3 euros ( some fine locally brewed ipa ) . 
  avoid drinking beer in places called `` pijalnia '' , ones that are really crowded and a lot of people are n't even sitting - they 're selling real pisswasser , but you can get cheap w\u00f3dka and a decent snack there ( 1 euro for 0,4 l beer / 20cl w\u00f3dka shot and 2 euros for a dish ) . 
  kukiz is around 15 % atm . 
  there is a chance for a stable one party government ( which is a good thing - pis is n't as bad as mainstream media and northern poland thinks - the same applied to po ) . 
  i think that this image is self-explanatory . 
  but for the record - it 's a sign of a roundabout named after bill clinton and monica lewinsky . 
  edit : if any of you want to visit - it 's snopkowo , in lubelskie voievodship . 
  in eastern poland . 
  so , yeah , [ this lad ] ( http://www.adweek.com/files/adfreak/images/2/eastern-poland-1.jpg ) might be somehow related to this . 
  edit 2 : oh , yeah , source : http://www.tvn24.pl/rondo-im-clintona-i-lewinsky-w-lubelskiej-wsi-znak-trafi-na-zlom,558554,s.html apparently , it was a joke . 
  and apparentyl they begin to create hostile enviroment for other refugees : http://pikio.pl/uchodzcy-o-polskim-osrodku-tu-jest-panstwo-islamskie/ tl ; dr - chechen refugees tell ukrainians and georgians that they have to obey islamic law . 
  the list of astronomers has got hevelius and copernicus , yet the map provided by op does n't acknowledge them ( hevelius was from gda\u0144sk , copernicus from toru\u0144 - there are no dots in those places ), 
  highest pit rate, 
  ramadan is quite nice ( at least in not extremely muslim country ) , ramadan markets are awesome . 
  we all remember the great smog of ' 52 , mate . 
  s-21 is mostly empty , there 's not that much to steal ... 
  you forgot about a party or there was none ? 
  huh , that 's my name day too . 
  and i do n't celebrate my birthday for two reasons . 
  first primo - i was born in july , second primo - i 'm getting too old for this shit . 
  but yeah , getting hammered on my name day is a must . 
  tbh , i would n't even imagine to spell it the way / u/ajuc did . 
  but yeah , lw\u00f3w is awesome . 
  or it was awesome when i was there last time in 2008 . 
  it 's more than 50 pln . 
  i think that 100 pln is the lowest ticket you can get . 
  there are multiple breweries that do that , it 's called [ krachla ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e73gkw8ivs4/vcmyu78phwi/aaaaaaaau7w/1yjvoicno3y/s1600/piwo%2b1388.jpg ) in polish and it 's awesome . 
  i often buy those , so i have cheap bottles that i can use to store drinks or syrups i make . 
  left for osaka , right for the rest of the country . 
  for us life is like an rpg - if we know where is our goal , we try to wander around and find out what else is around . 
  for example goats , we do n't have many of them in poland , so we like to make pictures of them . 
  that , and the fact that when you say `` pravo '' , you mean `` straight ahead '' , not `` to the right '' as in polish ... 
  `` if you repeat a lie often enough , it becomes the truth . '', 
  tell that to [ james comey ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/2/artykul/204015,fbi-chief-poles-partly-responsible-for-holocaust ) . 
  [ simon peres ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3531780,00.html ) says that poles were not responsible for holocaust . 
  but `` bernie '' from seattle under this article writes :  4 . 
  polish did not cause the holocaust  they just served as the german nazi 's very willing surrogates to exterminate the jews whom they hated with a passion , and then robbed their possessions . 
  and carried out pogroms after the war and murdered lotted and destroyed any jewish remembrance on their soil !, 
  they just finished the job the germans started . 
  the poles , the ukranians and the latvians were among the most savage and brutal guards in the concentration camps in poland . 
  and finally let 's not forget where auschwitz , treblinka and many of the other infamous camps were ; in poland !, 
  as the last poster says - `` truth gets blurry with time '' . 
  there are some jewish-americans that say that shoah was done by poles . 
  it 's very hurtful , considering that there is probably no pole that did n't lose family in the war , or had n't family in a kl ( my great grandpa was held at auschwitz ) ... 
  tourism-based economy is not very reliable . 
  that 's even more heroic !, 
   but they are not . 
  i seen some article discussing an expertise from a lawyer about that one . 
  besides - there was an investigation and they ( obviously ) could n't find anything . 
  the thing with law is that there are diffrent opinions . 
  in my opinion ( i 'm finishing law studies ) it might be considered unconstitutional . 
  in this case - ancyparowicz says that there is no evidence of breaking the law , but johann says that it 's apparent that belka broke the law . 
  it 's not math , also - there should be some sort of evidence proceedings and there was none . 
   what again : is n't against the law , regardless how shameful and outrageous it is .
