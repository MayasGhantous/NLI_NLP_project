  after this tape sienkiewicz retired from politics . 
  putting fire under a sentry box is against the law . 
  blaming it on opposition is a case that should be checked by some sort of commission or tribunal . 
  / u/skypl is pretty spot-on . 
  with two exceptions - some things discussed by our head of national bank might be considered a trace of some kind of unconstitutional acts . 
  and one the last leaked tape was a bombshell - head of our anti-corruption bureau wojtunik in a discussion with current eu comissary bie\u0144kowska said that our minister of interior sienkiewicz told police to put fire under a sentry box in front of russian embassy during an opposition march . 
  the most curious thing is - wojtunik is the only person that is n't going to be dismissed !, 
  but there are some new plots in whole tape scandal with some grand schemes by the richest pole , kulczyk . 
  2 500 pages were leaked , i think that we 'll know a lot more in following weeks when diffrent newspapers will cover the case . 
  as for now we know that there are some incriminating things there - moslty some shady bussineses between politicians and bussinesmen . 
  pff , no germans and russians , seems like heaven . 
   how politicians talk is not important and never was . 
  totally nobody made a big fuss about that . 
  yup . 
  i do n't care about it , mate , and it 's not the main point of this * afera * . 
  some people wanted to talk only about foul language of some people , but it 's a minor thing . 
  you 've missed the point . 
  one of the new issues is some kind of shady lobbying by kulczyk , the richest polish citizen ( since 2002 ) . 
  there are a lot more controversial , maybe illegal activities described in those documents . 
  how politicians talk is not important and never was . 
  sorry for mistake . 
  no , it 's not forbidden , the law was deemed by constitutional tribunal unconstitutional . 
  it is however possible to get a new clean ( er ) burning stove with 100 % deduction . 
  krak\u00f3w is poland 's 2nd largest city with very high population density in old city centre ( really old , oldest buildings are over 900 years old ; there are houses from 14th century and so on ) . 
  and those old stoves are an undeniable factor . 
  but there are two more : 1 . 
  as you 've said - topography . 
  krak\u00f3w is surrounded by hills , so smog tends to stick around . 
  the same problem is in my hometown of zakopane , which is located in mountains . 
  we need third and fourth ring road . 
  first one is basically only for public communication ( mainly trams ) , second one is a mess , because it 's the only one that 's easily accessible . 
  the third one was planned in 70s , but they 've never completed it . 
  the fourth one ( autobahn ) is done in 60 % , we need the north part and we 're all set up . 
  as for industry - steel mill is working only on one furnace , besides enviromental law regarding companies is pretty strict in poland , so they have to use the best technology possible . 
  in fact , we 've already reached 2 % , f-16 payment budget is under ministry of finance , not mod , so it seems as if we did n't reach 2 % yet . 
  but mod budget will be over 2 % this , or next year . 
  and our military is quite decent , we have to work on navy though ... 
  and usa has bilateral treaties with those countries . 
  all those countries are close allies of the us , i do n't see anything wrong with that . 
  as for krak\u00f3w - really tasty polish cuisine in [ koko ] ( http://www.gospodakoko.pl/ ) . 
  lunch for 3,5 euro . 
  but it 's not an elegant restaurant . 
  for 25 euro you 'll get a dinner in a really posh place ( i 've never eaten for more than 10 bucks tbh , 5 , maybe 7 euro is my upper limit ) . 
  i attended courses on polish constitution , comparative constitutional systems and i 've been on few lectures about central european constitutional law . 
  so to answer your first question - no , it 's pretty common , especially with newer constitutions ( like polish ) . 
  some countires have it a bit harder ( japan - 2/3 in both houses + referendum ) . 
  and i think that in estonia it 's 3/5 of two consecutive parliaments , not governments , is n't it ? 
   poland has no further relevance umm ... you 're wrong . 
  poland is the biggest `` new eu '' country , gateway to the east , the only economy that did n't shrink during the crisis , one of the most rapidly modernizing armies in nato . 
  poland is on the rise , mate . 
  and strengthening voice of central europe , of former russian sphere of influence is something that would most certainly benefit any international organization ( not to say that we 're member of almost any relevant international organization ) . 
  we 've got startegic partnership agreements with china and japan , we 're main ally of the us in this part of the world , we 're part of weimar triangle . 
  saying that we 're not relevant is , well , not true . 
  we 're in much less stable neighborhood than netherlands , we 're bigger and have more diverse economy ( by the fact we 've got some natural resources ) - that makes us an attractive partner and important subject of international politics . 
  it 's not a constest though . 
  only one nad in modified version ( as a heavy patroling vessel ) , this project is a failure and i think that cba should control it . 
  france and germany are n't northern countries . 
  lol , renault ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yeah , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ see ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pre-trianon ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ map, 
  all this `` snippiditty , snippidoo '' makes me think it 's about circumcision .

  if you want to have a good time in beijing , do n't visit 50 % of moast famous places ( especially forbidden palace ) . 
  just wander through hutongs . 
  shanghai is cool , especially bund . 
  i hate japan , but i might be biased . 
  it might have been better , if i had cash and did n't have to eat some crappy super-market bought food and sleep on floor in my friend 's dormitory . 
  especially penang , i love penang . 
  and cameron highlands . 
  and tioman . 
  kl is okay , but it 's shitty place to live , imo , i like walking and this city is not suitable for people without a car . 
  try walking from kl sentral to lake gardens ( my favourite place to relax ) , it 's insane . 
  it 's really cool . 
  really cool . 
  but it 's a bit expensive ( and fucking expensive if you have to live there - look at car and car licence prices there , not to mention good accomodation ) . 
  thailand - too much sex-tourism . 
  i love rural or non-touristic thailand though . 
  i prefer walking through a slum on opposite side of chao phraya than khao san . 
  and i quite like hat yai ( almost nothing too see plus terrorism , but for some strange reason i like this place ) . 
  cambodia is cool , because angkor wat . 
  this year i 'm going to sihanoukville and kampot , i ca n't wait to see abandoned french casion on a hill - [ bokor ] ( https://photos.travelblog.org/photos/28671/150215/f/1077972-abandoned-casino--bokor-np-0.jpg ) . 
  vietnam is cool , especially central vietnam . 
  and , as always , more rural , off the beaten track places are pretty cool . 
  my fav is hue , because of a shrine dedicated to polish architect who helped to restore their forbidden palace . 
  and , last but not least , laos . 
  luang prabang especially . 
  love it . 
  avoid vang-vieng , too many drunken/on hash/opium/some other weird shit aussies/kiwis/brits / dutch / * otherwhitepeople * ... 
  pretty depressing place , after two days i 've started to hate this place ( and i like to drink and party , but not with those people , i think ) . 
  and 1945 . 
  meh , life is like butter - if you spread it too much , it becomes too thin and does n't taste as good as it could . 
  he 's from silesia . 
  in proper poland we 'd do this even with some taxes . 
  like capitation tax . 
  but nothing more , if we 're taxed we do n't want to procreate . 
  it was n't lifestock , it was a pet ... and killing lifestock has to be done in controlled enviroment , not during some talk show ... 
  it 's a matter of context . 
  it 's obvious that we have to kill animals to eat them , but it should n't be done in a public place ( moreover , it was n't a `` meat rabbit '' , it was a pet ) . 
  the same goes with defecation . 
  it 's not nice , but we do it . 
  i thought that i would never say it , but buzzfeed has handled it far better : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffw5gplsjce, 
  yeah , highest gdp per capita in poland , literally mordor .
