  other facts - students voted for duda and prisoners voted for komorowski . 
  yep , all this `` poland a and poland b '' bullshit propaganda done by po supporters has no factual support . 
  the same thing is with crime - it 's higher in large cities and western voievodships - [ map ] ( http://thefad.pl/sites/default/files/1036439110759016.jpg ) .

  bronek got smashed . 
  now there will be nacht der langen messer in po . 
  to zygmunt iii . 
  that he 's a dick and should let his son to convert to orthodoxy , so he would be accepted by boyars as a new czar of russia . 
  there are citizens that are n't priests . 
  swiss guards , for example . 
  [ that contest ai n't right , i tell you h ` wat ... ] ( http://static2.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/you+log+out+you+say+it+_a4fd7090dccd74ed6eb213f7b8fe50b9.jpg ), 
  we 've got [ red guard organization ] ( http://polish.llco.org/ ) , who are third-world maoists . 
  they 're in an alliance with other third-worlders , falanga . 
  966 , baptism of poland . 
  1920 , kicking bolshevik 's asses in battle of warsaw . 
  without either of those two , there would be no poland and no poles . 
  georgians , you 're bunch of tough sobs . 
  love you . 
  i hope this video goes viral , because it 's incredible how those men collectively tried to disarm this lunatic . 
  oh god , fosters was my beer of ... well , not beer of choice , more like beer of need when i 've lived in malaysia . 
  it was either fosters for 1,20 usd per 0,5 l tin , or carlsberg for twice that much . 
  and fosters is better than thai `` cheers '' , which was it 's main competitor in a nearby supermarket ... 
  it 's pretty common in japan ( and it 's a safe bet , because they have some nasty beers there - those [ no-purine ] ( http://s378152838.online.de/en/english-japan-sapporo-breweries-achieves-the-worlds-first-zero-purine-beer-type-beverage/ ) brews taste like dead person 's saliva ) . 
  i 've also had it in malaysia . 
  not counting craft beers in , i 'd have to say guiness ( or some other irish beer ) . 
  i also have a soft spot for lvivskie ( 'cause my grandpa was born in lw\u00f3w and being a lwowiak was important for him ) and zlaty bazant ( because when i was a kid , my parents used to go to sucha hora in slovakia and buy a lot of this beer , i got some studentska chocolate and lentilky , which are basically the same as smarties - we had sweets like that , but lentilky were way tastier ) . 
  belgian beers are usually stronger , including grimbergen . 
  the same goes for mainstream polish lagers , they 're usually between 5,5 % to 6 % . 
  and we have also `` strong lagers '' , which are even ... stronger . 
  it 's hard to find beer that has less than 5,5 % , although i think that we 'll have a small revolution thanks to the fact , that [ grodziskie ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grodziskie ) has been brought back to life . 
  and if they 're posted in a thread about film in general , people wo n't read them . 
  does n't make any diffrence , if you use that logic .

  it was a contested border , czechoslovakia has attacked us when we 've fought bolsheviks . 
  it was basically one city , and it 's beeing compared to events that led to 6 millions polish citizens getting killed by shot in the back , starvation or gas chamber . 
  fuck you , mate . 
  my grandparents lost their parents , one of my great-grandpas survived auschwitz , other was beaten to death by fucking commie pigs in 1940s , after the war . 
  and you compare annexation of primarly polish , contested region to a fucking genocide ? 
  it 's an open wound , mate . 
  fuck you .

  so am i. 
  mainly because i do n't like korean pop-culture . 
  it 's easier for me to learn chinese ( mandarin ) , tbh . 
  characters are helpful in remembering words . 
  meh , i 'm not his supporter , but he 's a clever guy and knows how to talk to people . 
  i think it 's not fair to criticize him for not having matura , this guy is pretty well-read . 
  it 's also important to note , that all westernmost voievodships and warmi\u0144sko-mazurskie had little to none ethnical polish inhabitants prior to 1945 . 
  people there are descendants of people from current belarus , ukraine and lithuania ( so basically old russia and old austria ) . 
  so am i , am catholic . 
  yeah , i 'm so radical i watered plants and ironed my clothes today . 
  i hope for duda . 
  last thing we need is another seven years of komorowski ... 
  i hope for less partizanship , more socially and politically active society . 
  dividing poles , in the way komorowski did , is a catastrophy . 
  i 've been a po supporter in 2005 . 
  i want more democracy and free market . 
  polish and english . 
  a little malay ( hawker-stall level ) . 
  some korean ( i 've learned it for 3 years and plan to returning to learning it ) . 
  currently i 'm learning german ( i 've learned it for 9 years already , but i 've dropped it after hs , now , after five years , i 've started attending a course in goethe institute ) and chinese ( my first year of learning it ) . 
  i 've learned russian for some time , i can read and understand a bit . 
  you 're cool , haralambos , i like you . 
  some of old names are fine , imo . 
  my great-grandpa 's name was eugeniusz , gieniek is a fine name . 
  other was named melchior . 
  i think that those names will come back . 
  but all those soap-opera names ( not only from melrose place , there was a time when esmeralda or isaura were popular names ) are fucking disgusting . 
  my uncle has named his daughter nicole . 
  nato , eu , support for ukraine , pro-life stance , ordoliberalism . 
  without all this demagogue-ish crap that pis likes to serve . 
  strengthening democracy , by promoting civic activism . 
  anti-communism . 
  okay , that 's all , 1hr to election silence !, 
  for me it 's heaven . 
  i 'm 100 % right-wing . 
  catholic cracovian inteligentsia ( gowin , with upr sentiments ) . 
  elections in 2010 were difficult for me for this reason , because i had three candidates i could vote for ( jkm , kornel morawiecki and marek jurek ) , this time i would n't have problem voting for any candidate except palikot , komorowski and tanajno ( yeah , og\u00f3rek is not a leftist , i could vote for her ) . 
  but i wo n't vote . 
  i 'll vote 24th for duda ( despite his fiscal-liberal economic ideas ) . 
  and tbh - i would n't want braun , kukiz , jkm , kowalski or wilk as president . 
  they 're either too extreme ( vide : braun , i love his spots , i love how he does n't give shit about being pc , but that 's not politics ) , or i do n't think they 're a good president material . 
  i belive that duda is fit to be a president ( despite the fact , that i do n't agree with him on many issues - he 's similar to lech kaczy\u0144ski on economic issues , a tad too far on the left for me ) . 
  it is n't . 
  it was great two years ago , now it 's pretty crappy . 
  me too . 
  the only thing that keeps me using chrome is laziness . 
  it freezes all the time , especially on youtube . 
   the flag is flown continuously during the first three days of may . 
  there are people ( including * moi * ) who raise a flag on may 2 . 
  may 1 , because of its past , is often pretty much ignored . 
  celebrations are really small - [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/5h08gbyc7i0?t=2m19s ) is a `` crowd '' in front of an event held by main leftist party ( which probably would be considered pretty right wing in may european countries ) . 
  it 's its leader , former pm , speaking . 
  in warsaw . 
  and from other angles it 's easy to see that there were probably two or three dozen people there . 
  and our president did n't mention 1st of may on his publicly broadcasted speech yesterday .
