  atm 3 % . 
  she 's miserable . 
  i 'll repeat a quote from / r/polska ( yeah , we 're * stronk * ) . 
  okay , / u/zyllber , i know you 're a communist and an educated man . 
  i respect that . 
  but whitewashing lenin is wrong . 
  and comparing to the ccp whitewash of mao just proves the point - mao was n't `` 70 % good , 30 % bad . 
  '' , he was even worse than lenin ( mainly because he was an utter idiot , while lenin was a ruthless ideologist ) . 
  for me an idea of just and equal society on earth is wrong in the very core of it . 
  one of the arguments against it , of a christian nature , would be that that kind of order might only be achieved in * reich gottes * . 
  more secular argument would be - if you want to make a classless society , you have to harm a lot of people . 
  and that 's the main fault of lenin . 
  look at western countries - gradual reform ( starting with agricultural reforms , handing land to peasants , that 's one of the leftists ' ideas that had to be enforced , because inequality was too big in the society back in early 19th century ) lead them ( you ! ), 
  to societies with relatively small income gap . 
  without resorting to violence . 
  russia is a shithole without consideration for the most important european value - rule of law with radbruch 's unrecht ( lex iniustissima non est lex ) as a centre . 
  i 'd like to argue about it , but i 've got to go sleep soon . 
  another time , my favourite leftist on reddit . 
  lenin was a cruel dictator . 
  read about , for example , antonovshchina . 
  + swag, 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  there is a diffrence in a popular uprising and an invasion , changing stable borders . 
  also , germany falsified the result of silesian referendum by getting 100 000 germans that lived outside of the region to vote . 
  my great-grandparents did n't fight in silesian uprisings so we would now willingly form a union with germany . 
  i 'd go for a confederation with czechia nad slovakia . 
  radio free europe is fine . 
  sputnik is n't . 
  tbh i did n't even notice it 's a gif . 
  but the source with maps in separate files are posted all over the thread , it 's better to check the source than struggle with this shitty gif ... 
  chill , here are those maps : http://www.gulagmaps.org/maps/map.php?series=2&amp;map=u4954, 
  there are borders , there is no ( or limited ) border control . 
  criminal and fool . 
  it 's a good thing that a week politician was the head of ussr , but he was n't an innocent man as some western countries portray him . 
  he was , in fact , a dictator with blood on his hands . 
  i agree with the first part of your post . 
  but in case of importance of this wreck in determining the cause of the crash , you 're wrong . 
  it 's especially important in determining if there was explosion before the impact - e.g. 
  the force of an explosion makes metal bend in a particular way . 
  tbh vegetables are really good in poland , including tomatoes . 
  olives are imported , so they 're the same . 
  pederasty used to mean homosexuality . 
  it 's the same case as with sodomy , which now means mainly bestiality , but it also used to mean homosexual acts . 
  i 've lived in kl for some time , i did n't even say `` this roti canai costs 1 myr '' . 
  it costed 1 pln for me . 
  i think it 's because of schengen . 
  many countries has exceptions like that ( or of other nature - like preferences for people from former colonies ) . 
  from wiki :  the oecd defines itself as a forum of countries committed to democracy and the market economy , providing a setting to compare policy experiences , seek answers to common problems , identify good practices , and co-ordinate domestic and international policies . 
  its mandate covers economic , environmental , and social issues . 
  it acts by peer pressure to improve policy and implement `` soft law '' -- non-binding instruments that can occasionally lead to binding treaties . 
  in this work , the oecd cooperates with businesses , with trade unions and with other representatives of civil society . 
  collaboration at the oecd regarding taxation , for example , has fostered the growth of a global web of bilateral tax treaties . 
   the oecd promotes policies designed :  * to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment and a rising standard of living in member countries , while maintaining financial stability , and thus to contribute to the development of the world economy ;  * to contribute to sound economic expansion in member as well as nonmember countries in the process of economic development ; and  * to contribute to the expansion of world trade on a multilateral , nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with international obligations . 
  it 's sort of `` developed countries club '' , it 's important as an organization , because it helps cooperate and make agreements in a relatively small group of countries from all over the world . 
  the voice of oecd might be thus stronger than just eu or usa , because you 've got all the strongest economies and stable democracies as members . 
  because vast majority of oecd countries are in europe . 
  i 've also provided eurostat data in the comments section , it includes all the countries you 've mentioned . 
  both latvia and lithuania are negotiating accession with oecd ( since 2013 and this year respectively ) . 
  slovakia , as / u/yourguilt101 kindly pointed out , is a member since 2000 and is mentioned in the main link above . 
  according to wiki romania did n't even apply .

  wages in oecd ( in polish ; stany zjednoczone = usa , wielka brytania = gb - i know it should be uk :p , szwecja = sweden , dania = denmark , w\u0142ochy = italy , w\u0119gry = hungary , hiszpania = spain , the rest is almost the same as in english ) : http://imgur.com/w8afpwh ( mr. wimmer 's screenshot ) . 
  watch out for lukashenkoman , he 's said to be leading armies of orcs from his tower in minsk . 
  most of those areas are polish only since 1945 and people there were settled there forcibly by soviets . 
   zygmunt stary [ 5 ] had an opportunity in wiping out the future prussia , but nah , we 'll let them stay there , what can they do ? 
  it was n't that easy . 
  it would probably lead to war with brandenburg , maybe even hre ( not to mention how our burghers would react ) . 
  it 's easy to say that he ( and sejm ) made a bad call , but who would have thought that this tiny bit of impoverished land would get milions of poles killed and help wiping poland from map of europe . 
  and warne\u0144czyk was n't crazy . 
  i think that something more fitting would be jacek kaczmarski : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ygs9vhmfs0 * piosenka \u015bpiewana * is a genre specific to poland , czechia and russia . 
  tadeusz wo\u017aniak would also be fine : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obvizjrneza, 
  considering the state of german army , obama being a whimp , finland not being in nato ... 
  communist russia funded hitler and jiang jieshi of guomintang . 
  both of them were n't communist . 
  that would be a lot . 
  poland is increasing its military spending ( i hope we 'll have more than 2 % of gdp soon ) , it would be good if france would decide not to sell mistrals to russia and germany would have any military budget whatsoever , so their planes and tanks could be used . 
  i 'm waiting for mt parents to eat easter breakfest , after that i 'm going to church . 
  today i 'm preparing ham for dinner ( my father is going to cook a duck ) . 
  tomorrow i 'll make an awesome rabbit . 
   russia ` bought ' marine le pen 's support over crimea ftfy : russia bought marine le pen 's support over crimea, 
  yep , on of my great grandpas had to flee lw\u00f3w when soviets came . 
  he was an enterpreneur and polish-bolshevik war veteran , people like him were either killed on sight or deported . 
  there is also [ shoji tabuchi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skthbnnaccw ) , king of branson . 
  i like christian personalism , so john paul ii is high on the list . 
  also , g.k. chesterton . 
  and kant . 
  yes , we do . 
  if someone is a threat to public health and safety , there even might be a need to use force . 
  not vaccinating children is a risk to public safety . 
  so it should be obligatory to vaccinate them . 
  czechs are silly . 
  also it is important to remember that 20 years earlier czechoslovakia attacked poland while we were fighting against bolsheviks . 
  those were contested territories and imo comparing poland to germany is unfair . 
  far worse thing done in early 20th century was abandoning petlura and letting russia keep parts of ukraine and belarus ( we should have help to create free , democratic republics there - as it aws initially planned ) . 
  and annexing wilno . 
  especially with large font `` april fools '' in the title . 
  and tbh it 's as believable as jerzy urban joining a rosary circle . 
  [ here you are ] ( http://picco.pl/pol_pl_masc-na-bol-dupy-1341_1.jpg ) . 
  this vote was russian initiative . 
  we 'd vote against them , even if they proposed us un security council membership or grant us monopoly in production of w\u00f3dka .
