  so it is `` t '' after all !, 
  thanks for straightening my guess !, 
  and lech wa\u0142\u0119sa with his airport ? 
  :  edit : but yeah , you 're basically right . 
  john paul ii , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher are pretty much national heroes of poland . 
  despite how they are viewed by others , we consider them one of the most important people in defeating ussr . 
  besides , poland is pretty right-wing country , so celebrating them is n't controversial at all . 
  yeah , in this context i guess you 're right . 
  but the list is a lot longer , if you count other communist leaders . 
  the map is a bit misleading , there were more cities named after prominent commies . 
  with gorki and kalinin ( grad ) as main examples . 
  in poland it was very rare to do so ( and did n't last too long , we 've had stalinogr\u00f3d for only 3 years ) . 
  and , depending on city , most of streets named after communists ( especially soviet , but polish too ) were renamed . 
  i think that what happened in krak\u00f3w is the most fun example of distancing from the communist past - the main route from the `` old '' krak\u00f3w to nowa huta ( which was supposed to be an ideal communist city , to balance strong , burgeoise krak\u00f3w - now it 's a part of krak\u00f3w ) is called john paul the ii street . 
  the main square of nowa huta ( central square ) was renamed to `` central square of ronald reagan '' . 
  and there is a big `` solidarity '' monument right next to the square . 
  on the opposite side there was a lenin statue , which was demolished in 1989 ( earlier there were attempts to blow it up , in 1979 a group of people set explosives on the statue , but the explosion was too weak to do any serious harm to it ) . 
  it 's * kebabs * in eurolinguo . 
  putinbots too ? 
  ** context ** : from 1953 to 1956 katowice was named stalinogr\u00f3d . 
  ~ ~ as for this `` wtf '' sign - it 's actually wf ( which means p.e. , acronym of physical education ) , the `` t '' is actually a pick-axe ( katowice is a coal mining city , a capital of upper silesia ) . 
  that 's my guess , but it 's very probable . ~ ~ ** for the actual meaning of wtf read / u/szyy post below !, 
  ** the portrait is of [ boles\u0142aw bierut ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boles%c5%82aw_bierut ) , who was a first secretary of the party from 1948 to 1956 , when he mysteriously died in moscow . 
  crosspost with / r/polska . 
  agatha christie is awesome , i 've had a time in my life ( about two or three years ago ) when i 've read about four of her books in twoo weeks . 
  i just could n't stop . 
  leave it be , the idea is the same and you 've provided the actual photo and sources . 
  good enough for me ( and , i hope , all of us ) . 
  they 're sad . 
  why did they even mention us ? 
  lem was a genius . 
   on september 2 , 1974 philip k. dick sent the following letter to the fbi ( please keep in mind mr. dick was most probably suffering from schizophrenia ) :  ** k. dick to the fbi , september 2 , 1974 **  i am enclosing the letterhead of professor darko suvin , to go with information and enclosures which i have sent you previously . 
  this is the first contact i have had with professor suvin . 
  listed with him are three marxists whom i sent you information about before , based on personal dealings with them : peter fitting , fredric jameson , and franz rottensteiner who is stanislaw lem 's official western agent . 
  the text of the letter indicates the extensive influence of this publication , science-fiction studies . 
   what is involved here is not that these persons are marxists per se or even that fitting , rottensteiner and suvin are foreign-based but that all of them without exception represent dedicated outlets in a chain of command from stanislaw lem in krakow , poland , himself a total party functionary ( i know this from his published writing and personal letters to me and to other people ) . 
  ** for an iron curtain party group - lem is probably a composite committee rather than an individual , since he writes in several styles and sometimes reads foreign , to him , languages and sometimes does not - to gain monopoly positions of power from which they can control opinion through criticism and pedagogic essays is a threat to our whole field of science fiction and its free exchange of views and ideas . 
  ** peter fitting has in addition begun to review books for the magazines locus and galaxy . 
  the party operates ( a u. . s. ] publishing house which does a great deal of party-controlled science fiction . 
  and in earlier material which i sent to you i indicated their evident penetration of the crucial publications of our professional organization science fiction writers of america . 
   their main successes would appear to be in the fields of academic articles , book reviews and possibly through our organization the control in the future of the awarding of honors and titles . 
  i think , though , at this time , that their campaign to establish lem himself as a major novelist and critic is losing ground ; it has begun to encounter serious opposition : lem 's creative abilities now appear to have been overrated and lem 's crude , insulting and downright ignorant attacks on american science fiction and american science fiction writers went too far too fast and alienated everyone but the party faithful ( i am one of those highly alienated ) . 
   it is a grim development for our field and its hopes to find much of our criticism and academic theses and publications completely controlled by a faceless group in krakow , poland . 
  what can be done , though , i do not know . 
  * farewell , my lovely * by raymond chandler . 
  and polish administrative code . 
  not to me . 
  to me czech is funny . 
  [ cock ] ( https://youtu.be/hrc3hwvnm5s?t=17s ), 
  who needs kitajskie cars ?!, 
  glorious [ lada ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snh7ygav9xk ) is all ruskie need !, 
  in the evening , i 'll drink a beer for your health and well-being , mate !, 
  could someone post it in the comments ? 
  we 're also opening terminal this year . 
  we are building interconnectors with czechia , slovakia , lithuania . 
  i 've just written about it . 
  after the plane crash people have thought it would be a great opportunity to make a `` reset '' in relations with russia . 
  but mishandling of the investigation quickly brought us back to reality . 
  okay , few things i 'd like to add : * the war in georgia had none ( or very marginal ) effect on the views on russia - the narration in the media and by politicians was pretty diverse -  from unconditional support for georgia by president kaczy\u0144ski , to belittling his efforts by others , * events of 10 iv 2010 ( the crash of presidential plane ) led to more favourable views on russia . 
  even the brother of the late president had made a speech `` to our russian brothers '' . 
  * but the way the investigation has been handled made people dislike russia . 
  remember , we still do n't have the plane and there are massive doubts about the investigation ( which is natural , russians mistook bodies of deceased and put them to wrong coffins - if they could n't correctly identify casualties , all those doubts seem reasonable ) . 
  * ukraine . 
  only 7 % of poles are undecided . 
  only one in 10 likes russia . 
  the same goes with eu . 
  it would collapse - it 's a political union and it can not exist without solidarity of members and trust between them . 
   what happened happened . 
  no need to drag it up in insincere attempts . 
  what you should do if you care is to campaign for poland and russia to return the cultural items they stole from germany . 
  pfff , do n't make me laugh . 
  large part of our cultural heritage has been stolen by swedes , russians , germans . 
  partly it has been restored , but germans during ww2 destroyed some of it ( ever heard of a city called warsaw ? 
  it was in fucking ruins ) . 
  so do n't tell us that we 've stolen anything . 
  we 've lost half of our territory in the east and got the land on the west - most of which we did n't even want ( there were territories that we 've believed were rightfully ours , they were in minority though ) . 
  we did n't even get any compensation from germany for destroying our capital . 
  sure , i know that - when i 've started studying those five years ago i knew maybe three ukrainians , now i see ukrainian names on lists all the time . 
  and they hang out in ukrainian-speaking environment , which was n't that prevalent few years ago - there were a lot of ukrainians ( mostly of polish descent ) who had to hang out with poles , because they usually had no peers speaking ukrainian on their year on the uni . 
  there 's a lot of ukrainians in krak\u00f3w right now . 
  you can hear ukrainian every time you ride a tram . 
  7 poles dead according to marshall ( speaker ) radek sikorski . 
  the most poles killed in a single terrorist attack since 9/11 . 
  we still have a lot to do . 
  but we 've always been in better situation ( no kebabs , nor ceausescu ) , :-), 
  and you 've been called central european !, 
  good job !, 
  sure , i 've been using world bank data many times ( but from their site ) , i simply do n't remember polish gini , nor specialize in polish economy , so i did n't pay that much attention to the graph i 've linked , i 've only remembered that it show the peak in mid-90s . 
  look at my edit . 
  :-) and [ that ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/gini_since_wwii.svg ) 's the graph i 've mentioned . 
  i think it should end on 2010 , this way the peak would be in 2004 . 
  did n't it peak in the mid 90s ? 
  i checked it yesterday while i was analysing gini for thailand but i forgot ... edit : yeah , you are correct , the graph i 've checked yesterday is wrong ( the one on the wikipedia about gini index ) , they 've entered data to the wrong column , i think . 
  world bank says that 2004 was the worst . 
  yep , our middle-class is growing fast . 
  gini skyrocketed in early 90s , but since then it 's falling steadily . 
  polish mfa has informed that 4 of those people might be polish . 
  3 of the inhured are confirmed to be polish . 
  yeah , but we `` only '' took disputed areas , which were annexed from poland by czechs when we fought bolsheviks .
