  czechs also commited war crimes during this agression , killing pow and civilizans . 
  moreover , hitler was n't a genocidal maniac ( yet ) . 
  and we had two options - letting hitler annex zaolzie , which was inhabited mostly by poles , or annex it ourselves . 
  we were n't in position to defend the independence of czechoslovakia . 
  meh , mainstream beers are okay . 
  seriously , try some mainstream chinese or even hungarian stuff . 
  even quite okayish thai/australian beers are starting to taste like crap after few months of having to drink them ( i do n't mention stuff from philippines , it 's just nasty - i 've lived in malaysia and there were only about 5 brands available - and not always , usually they were sold out in few days - that were in my price range , which was 1 euro for 0,3 can , carlsberg was around 12 z\u0142 for a pint in 7-11 ) . 
  so i say cheers with a bottle of fine harna\u015b for 1,9 z\u0142oty in front of me . 
  cheap polish beer is almost always pretty okay . 
  but we 've also got some great microbreweries !,

  i 've just finished my gouda & sriracha toast . 
  sure , i love hot sauces , i make great sambal myself . 
  :-d and tabasco is okay for soups , but i prefer louisiana hot sauce ( less vinegar ) . 
  eros piszta is awesome on a sandwich or added to goulash/lecso ( both homemade , i try to cook/prepare everything by myself , it 's cheaper that way and i quite enjoy cooking ) . 
  as for zapiekanka ... 
  i think i should grab some this week , i have n't eaten it for ages and i live in krak\u00f3w , world capital of zapiekanka . 
  [ nope , he 's not ] ( http://laaake.com/ ) . 
  so it is n't even navy ? 
  that way , how can we say if the guy on the left is from grom ? 
  he 's world 's sauron atm , so he 's probably making it himself at mount doom . 
  imo the guy on right is from grom , both uniform and gun are correct . 
  amen , brother !,

  imagine treating a pig like this , all the intesines would be spilled all over the meat , it would be bitter . 
  and canada is in europe , right ? 
  i did n't write that it 's a movie from the us , but from america . 
  sorry for considering canada a new world , american country . 
  there are also scenes with polish actors : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtn47dbfgea,

  btw , we know how serbia [ looks like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5efuw_3lis0 ) . 
  you know , i know it , every pole knows it . 
  but western allies did n't want to aknowledge it for a long time , people in communist poland were persecuted for telling the truth . 
  it will take few more years to balance the perception of ussr 's involvment in the 2ndww among the people of europe . 
  poland should be at least 1956 , when soviet generals massacred protesters in pozna\u0144 and nkvd still had a lot of direct power . 
  some would say that it should be 1993 , when soviet soldiers left poland . 
  and i 'd count poles in moscow as last occupation for russia ( they even celebrate day of moscow 's liberation from polish invaders ) . 
  fuck , over 10 % of kazakhstan 's population !, 
  and germans have stopped hundreds of kilometers west from kazakhstan !, 
  it 's just revolting . 
  / u/mtgdjs has mentioned gda\u0144sk , and there will be a parade on that day . 
  we 're also not going to moscow , i hope others ( i really hope not only for merkel , but also poroshenko , obama , hollande and our other allies ) will join us and celebrate the victory on polish soil . 
  that 's great news . 
  and it 's pretty obvious , i 'd say that even more people from the crew would go after them tothis new network ( whichever will it be ) .

  enjoy !, 
  grass is enjoying our freedom and ~ ~ golden ~ ~ green liberty . 
  we have to find the balance between the economy and the environment . 
  in poland we try to invest in all those eco-friendly sources of electricity , but we are and will be dependent on coal for decades . 
  which does n't mean we should n't try to reduce co2 , pm2 ,5 and pm10 emission - according to our law , companies are obliged to use the best technology availible to reduce emission . 
  but still , in last 200 years , we 've been independent for around 50 years , we 've been a battlefield for two world wars . 
  we ca n't switch in a blink of an eye to renewables - we have to catch up first . 
  that being said , things like recycling are a must , it does n't cost much and is pretty sensible . 
  in my hometown everyone recycles , because it 's cheaper . 
  but as i live in krak\u00f3w now - in my block we 've got only few recycling bins that are full all the time , so i ca n't do a lot in this matter . 
  atlanticism . 
  we 're the main partner ( s ) the us has . 
  we share our history , culture , religion . 
  we 're allies . 
  i specialize in east asian affairs by trade , but it 's a lot easier to understand people from across the pond , than from any asian country ( even though i 've lived in asia , and i 've never been in america ) . 
  braline rightful polabian clay !, 
  it is considered a disaster . 
  and it was considered a disaster 10 years ago ( lpr has proposed a tax on unmarried men ) . 
  i 'm 25 and only two of my colleagues are married . 
  i do n't think i 'll be married in the next 5 years , not to mention having children . 
  things have changed , but i think most of people will have children , the thing is that people rapidly changed their lifestyle ( it 's because of the higher education , all this internship crap and so on ) and simply can not even consider having children before they 're 30 . 
  so , in my opinion , two main reasons are : low paying jobs , education takes longer ( i 'll graduate next year with two degrees , but had to take my studies on hold because of internship abroad , and some asinine exams that i 've tried to pass several times only succeeding last year ) . 
  not only . 
  women were allowed to vote in poland 1918 . 
  in the commonwealth , women could inherit stuff . 
  which was pretty rare . 
  there is a place for women in the army , but there has to be some kind of separation . 
  submarines with both genders are for example pretty dangerous - imagine few dozen of horny , 20-year olds caged in a small place with several women . 
  that wo n't end well . 
  the same goes with spec-ops or infantry - women are not able to carry that much weight , they are simply weaker . 
  there are physical requisitions that should be met and the idea of lowering them to somehow empower women is simply wrong . 
  soldiers should be as strong as possible ( the same goes for firemen or policemen ) , so they can perform their tasks as effective as possible . 
  sexual tension is also a big factor - and not only on a submarine but also in barracks . 
  there is a place for women in the army , but not every position is suitable for them .
