  i love '' - \u017ce '' suffix . 
  adding '' \u017ce '' makes a word , hmm , stronger ? 
  or more non-chalant ? 
  it definetely makes a sentence more like an order or demand . 
  and we 've got a psa with it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pnazdzg5kk, 
  neither did i. 
  we 've got `` mi to tito '' . 
  it means `` i do n't care '' , i do n't know if it 's tito or tito but tito is n't a word in polish ( but it rhymes , so it 's a thing , i suppose ) . 
  pfff , my great-grandpa lost a factory in lviv and right after the war was murdered by secret police , so my grandpa ( who was 5 at a time ) had to grow up without a father . 
  other grandpa had to take care of his siblings , because his father landed in kl auschwitz ( fortunately he has survived ) . 
  so fuck you , every pole lost several members of family , most of us lost land/houses on the east or in warsaw . 
  and we do n't bitch about it . 
  +1 [ commonwealth ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/january_uprising.svg/220px-january_uprising.svg.png ) bros 4eva . 
  you 're the main victims . 
  as always . 
  bah , our former president said that in 2007 . 
  in kiev . 
  [ here ] ( http://youtu.be/9lij221-lb0?t=4s ) 's the video . 
  edit : he was drunk as hell , but it was quite typical for him . 
  southern european . 
  those that get the most tourists . 
  we should impose new sanctions . 
  and high tariffs on some russian goods ( like gold or coal ) . 
  it fits . 
  western vote pattern moves east - last elections show that it has gone beyond the old commonwealth-russia border ( earlier crossing old austria-russia border ) . 
  every few years we make some border corrections with czechs and slovaks - a bit of land here , for a bit of land there . 
  it was done mainly to consolidate lots , so farmers would have their fields in one country , not two . 
  there is also the question of precision of the measurment and how a border on lakes and rivers is defined . 
  it 's basically non-news , stuff like that is quite normal . 
  we were the ruling class over `` kresy '' . 
  ukrainians were poor , poles ruled - mainly because rich ukrainians ( or ruthenians ) have polonized . 
  [ kiev , today ] ( http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/215/e/b/nsdap_rally_hall_by_themistrunsred-d59n9n0.jpg ) . 
  putin is part of fsb . 
  fsb rules through putin , he ca n't lose their support , it 's far more important than the will of the people of russia ( it means the least , i think ) . 
  why not putin ? 
  killing nemtsov has one purpose - to make people fear . 
  nemtsov was supposed to have some hard data on russian war against ukraine and was supposed to reveal it . 
  now he 's dead . 
  * high five *, 
  i 've been to slovakian lidl . 
  several leagues below polish lidl ( which is awesome - cheap veal , duck meat , rabbit meat , great wine , local beers and much more ) . 
  two things that i envy are eros pista and dirty cheap tokaj furmint . 
  lidl next to me is really nice , carrefour shitty . 
  and tesco on kapelanka ( polish headquarters ! ), 
  is awesome . 
  24/7 , big choice of products . 
  or flamingos wanting their own country . 
  the answer is : [ ursus 10014h ] ( http://ursus.com.pl/images/images/ursus-h.jpg ) . 
  but he supported vaticanum ii , which was a communist conspiracy !, 
  haymarket was in 1886 afaik . 
  and on 4th of may . 
  i 'm all for workers ' rights , remembering all those scandalous massacres ( like the one from chicago ) and so on . 
  but current date was chosen by the 2nd international and that 's what bothers me ( and it should be fucking 4th of may , not 1st ) . 
  bigos for breakfest ? 
  nice . 
  tbh , i 've never picked mushrooms ( for some reason nobody in my family did it , we were more of berry pickers [ syrups and wine are the things that we make in large quantities ] ) . 
  but i love mushrooms , i have a bag of dried boletus ' in a cupboard , and two jars of store-bought mushrooms ( bought them two days ago after watching a video about polish cuisine on youtube ) . 
  we get pretty big japanese tourist groups in krak\u00f3w . 
  and japanese really love watching chopin competition . 
  if japanese knows chopin , he most likely will know that he was born in poland . 
  i 'm an orientalist ( although i do n't specialize in japan ) and from my experience japanese know a thing or two about poland ( and it does n't apply to most east asian countries ) . 
  that 's simple , you 're a nationalist , but not a bigoted chauvinist . 
  i think that the idea of nation states is one of the greatest achievements of european ideological thought and it 's a shame that therer are still nations that can not govern themselves . 
  the idea of nationalism gets more complicated when we think about other continents though . 
  most countries in asia or africa created the idea of `` nation '' based on one ethnicity of their country , denying other ethnicities the name ( e.g. 
  chinese do n't even call cantonese a language , just a dialect , which is counterfactual ) . 
  smoked reindeer is probably amazing . 
  try cold kapusta . 
  we eat it both ways , it 's always great . 
  i 'd love it in even smaller portions . 
  i do n't want to throw out food , but usually i just want it as a side dish to my cutlet . 
  there is no person that represents `` regular '' folk in general . 
  he goes to a mass , some of his peers drink a beer , other sleep , and other train to become juggling experts . 
  we all have to be equal, 
  you 're right , i was talking about ethnicity , not citizenship . 
  it was jewish ghetto in german-occupied warsaw . 
  poles did n't have to live in ghetto 's , germans prefered [ forced relocations and stealing children from their parents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_zamojszczyzna_by_nazi_germany ) . 
  from time to time they have to kill some part of population of visent . 
  i remember that few years ago several of them ha to be killed ( it was in bieszczady ) , because they had tuberculosis . 
  if they did n't do this , whole population of visent would be in danger . 
  people do n't realize that hunters are crucial to maintaining population of wild mammals . 
  we do n't live in syberia , where wolves and bears have thousands of kilometers of untouched forest . 
  population of large mammals is small and they live in separated forests , so there is need to manage their population . 
  the most serene commonwealth . 
  and the name `` byzantium '' afaik was n't used by byzantines . 
  they called themselves romans , it was historians who started using this word . 
  the thing is that germans killed the whole family of a person who helped jews . 
  sanction for helping them was far more brutal than in the west . 
  afaik nobody was killed for it in netherlands or france , and only one man was murdered in denmark for helping jews in getting to sweden . 
  from two to fifty thousand poles were killed for helping jews , and historians estimate that from 280 000 to milion poles helped jews during the war . 
  around 100 000 jews were hiding ( with help from poles ) and around half of them survived the war . 
  in the same time dutch were able to organize protests against deportations of jews . 
  protests !, 
  that 's insane , in poland germans would gather those people and either send them to a death camp , or outright execute . 
  traditional polish dress looks like [ this ] ( http://static.folklor.pl/att/x-archiwum/wielkopolanie/50lecie_7.jpg ) . 
  op posted highlander dress , which is one of many folk dresses in poland . 
  anyway , there is huge variety . 
  but polish traditional dress would be nobility dress , like the one i 've posted above . 
   or someone pours money into organising public dissent ( because one thing it wo n't be is spontaneous ) , bringing the government to its knees . 
  lol , what ?
