  was it different before ? 
  anti-semitism , brutal eugenics , class war , were not only present in a public debate , but a state ideology ( or accepted practice ) of several countries . 
  that 's why a 500 + program is a necessity . 
  it might allow people to have a second ( third , fourth , etc. ), 
  child without a fear of poverty . 
  people saying it 's a waste of money do not consider how fucked we 'll be , if we 'll have a `` graying society '' . 
  and if 500 + wo n't help , well , it means less money spent on it , does n't it ? 
  so i either wo n't be that much of a burden for our budget , or it will help fight the population decrease and maintain more desirable wokringforce : retired people ratio . 
  i mean the image of slovakia from this clip , mate !, 
  worse than from [ akm ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9f0o1ohxtm&amp;ab_channel=donfantastickypess ), 
  i live 15 km from slovakia , so i know quite a lot about your country , mate . 
  i plan on doing a trip to lunik ix , i 've already driven past gypsy villages in vychodne slovensko ( around levoca ) , it 's fascinating . 
  :-d other than that - i like halusky , zlaty bazant and oravsky hrad is one of the best castles i 've been to . 
  oh , and i know a few songs by kontrafakt/rytmus . 
  i do n't even like hip-hop that much , but he 's as ridiculous as it gets . 
  ( jebem na to , jebem jebem na to and all those drunk gypsies in his clips , hilarious ) . 
  as for slovenia - i drank w\u00f3dka with two guys from slovenia once , that 's it . 
  i know some history , geography , things like that ... 
  [ history of latvia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eckied3rxrq&amp;ab_channel=ansis99 ) . 
  yeah , the problem is a lot of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jligalia_km&amp;ab_channel=ajwilku ) has happened in poland . 
  and wa\u0142\u0119sa probalby used his own men to get rid of documents ( he could appoint his own minister of interior affairs and minister of defence - all other ministers were under pm 's authority ) . 
  all of the documents are probalby untouched in moscow ... 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa did not sue cenckiewicz for his book and he lost a case against wyszkowski . 
  he admitted that he was an informant in 1992 , and recently too ( he said something like `` sb did n't play with me , i 've played sb '' , when asked about tw bolek case , i could n't find the video , it was during a public meeting in poland , 2015 or 2016 ) . 
  it was n't their plan from the beginning . 
  he was a tw in the 1970s , beofre he became the leader of solidarity . 
  there is probability that they 've helped him to become the leader - it 's quite obvious , that the opposition was heavily infiltrated . 
  after martial law in 1981 , solidarity was crushed , but wa\u0142\u0119sa was the nobel awarded hero , and people still believed in the ideas of solidarity ( which were n't anti-communist per se , they did n't call for abolishing communism in the beginning ) . 
  it was n't poker , it was an investment . 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa probably was n't a commie agent in 1980s , but they had documents saying that he was one in 1970s and when he became the leader , he was in their payroll . 
  he lived with a pistol next to his head , it was a brilliant move by commie secret service . 
  as / u/trenescese has mentioned - they were n't prosecuted , many of them lived very comfortably . 
  it was n't a `` risky retirement strategy '' , they were n't\u015btupid , they knew that socialism would n't last long ( the most open market poland ever was , was in 1988 , still in communism , after wilczek 's reform , which still a wet dream of polish libertarians ) . 
  and japanese destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki !, 
  what ? 
  church-bashing is the main hobby of half of polish media ... 
  [ newsweek ] ( http://www.eostroleka.pl/luba/dane/pliki/obrazy/okladka_newsweek_macierewicz.jpg ) [ wprost ] ( http://www.wprost.pl/g/wprost_covers/a/1719_a.jpg ) [ polityka ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/c6/4f/10/z17102790q,okladka__polityki_.jpg ) ( this one is the most ironic - `` polityka '' and daniel passent were the main supporters of the martial law ) . 
  yeah , controversial covers are pretty common . 
  i think op meant cereals as grains , not breakfest cereals . 
  in the case of grains - mostly wheat and rye , wheat bread is the cheap one , rye bread a bit more expensive . 
  spelt bread is also availible . 
  we of course eat quite a lot of pasta ( mainly in soups , but italian cuisine is something a lot of people eat almost every day ) . 
  rice - also in soups , asian cuisine , some particular polish dishes ( especially go\u0142\u0105bki and weet rice with fruits ) . 
  kasha is a standard carb in polish cuisine , but in the last 200 years potatoes became more popular ( i prefer kasha ) . 
  and a lot of barley in our beer . 
  i 've never eaten barley in any way , porridges are n't very popular . 
  millet is eaten only as kasha ( kasza jaglana , one of two most popular kasha types , the second one is kasza gryczana , made out of buckwheat ) . 
  the only porridge i 've ever eatten was made out of oats . 
  france had a country that was germany 's ally during the war . 
  in poland , the underground state , sent a death squad for helping germans in the genocide . 
  and my favourite kwa\u015bniewski meme : [ space distillery !, 
  that 's because you spend money on things like traveling to cambodia , mate . 
  for the price of a plane ticket you could buy a decnt laptop or phone . 
  and i 'm the same , i spend everything i have on plane tickets , but i 'm not delusional - i have a lot more cash than a tuk-tuk driver , even if his phone is fancier than mine . 
  jesus , what happened to your face ? 
  in poland students have to take matura exams in : * polish language ( including knowledge of polish and european literature ) * a selected modern language ( english , french , german , italian , spanish or russian ) * mathematics * as well as at least one subject at `` extended level '' ( poziom rozszerzony ) . 
  these include the above as well as : biology , chemistry , geography , social studies , history , history of art , history of music , information technology , physics and astronomy , latin and ancient history , philosophy , another modern language , languages of ethnic groups in poland ( belarusian , lithuanian , ukrainian ) , and the kashubian language . 
  source : wikipedia, 
  from my experience - they 're used as a decoration . 
  we 've used them once or twice through my education , i 've actually spent more time on tatami than excercising on wall bars on p.e. 
  `` ragnar russ '' sounds like a name of some kind of kick-ass varangian . 
  my favourite is miko\u0142aj gom\u00f3\u0142ka and [ kleszczmy r\u0119koma ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-05ofxn_os&amp;ab_channel=adidanziger ) ( psalm 47th ) . 
  oh , you 've also forgotten about karol szymanowski : [ symphony no . 
  60 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ezqiufnwyg&amp;ab_channel=musicanth ) . 
  but providing financial support does work . 
  `` taking refugees in '' does n't . 
  multi-kulti is a failure , and while it might have been considered a good idea 50 years ago , now it 's out of question . 
  and we take economic migrants from ukraine , i have nothing against it , but it 's not a matter of not enough workforce now , but in 30-40 years . 
  and even if they 'll stay , they wo n't miraculously start having children ( ukraine also has a demographic crisis , even worse than us ) . 
  i do n't , i saw this on twitter . 
  ye , it was fun christmas , destroyed three trees on my garden and i did n't have electricity for some time . 
  fun , fun . 
  afaik there was no electricity in poronin yesterday and , hm , szymony i guess . 
  i think it 's a necessity . 
  we 're facing a demographic catastrophe , and as for now , there are no better propositions . 
  bah , if only ... 
  bodies were sent in metal caskets , families were n't allowed to open them . 
  nope , mate . 
  according to this , 72 % wants further investigation . 
  nope , 51 % rejects , 27 strongly rejects . 
  you 're manipulating those stats - if you say that only 10 % are `` hardcore enthusiasts '' of conspiracy theory , do n't say that 51 % ** strongly ** rejects this idea , because that 's not true . 
  as i 've mentioned in this thread - i doubt it was an assassination , but i strongly believe there was not only negligence , but also a lot of bad will ( expecially on russia 's side - polish side has been played by russians ) . 
  sure they are n't . 
  i 'm among people who want the case to be solved openly and thoroughly , but i doubt it was an assassination or russian bomb . 
  51 % of poles do n't believe in assassination theory , 31 % thinks otherwise . 
  77 % thinks that the government did too little to explain what happened in smole\u0144sk . 
  only 20 % thinks that investigation did explain everything . 
  majority of poles want a new investigation , mate . 
  there 's a lot of great museums in krak\u00f3w . 
  [ main square underground museum ] ( http://www.mhk.pl/branches/rynek-underground ) [ sukiennice museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukiennice_museum ) - some of the best polish paintings are displayed there . 
  [ oskar schindler 's factory ] ( http://www.mhk.pl/branches/oskar-schindlers-factory ) [ polish aviation museum ] ( http://www.muzeumlotnictwa.pl/indexen.php ) - my fav , i live near it , i used to visit it at least once a month . 
  they have some really rare aircrafts there . 
  and near krak\u00f3w : [ wieliczka salt mine ] ( http://www.wieliczka-saltmine.com/ ) - you can get there with a city bus . 
  [ former german concentration and extermination camp auschwitz-birkenau ] ( http://auschwitz.org/en/museum/news/ ), 
  op 's wrong , i do n't speak french at all and everything was alright . 
  guides are pretty shitty ( nintendo ds with some program ) but they are in english . 
  and i do n't recall if any of the instructions/descriptions irl were n't translated into english . 
  i 've visited louvre a year ago . 
  if you think about , it is n't .
