  the first part was n't `` kac w vegas '' ( `` hangover in vegas '' ) but `` kac vegas '' ( `` vegas hangover '' ) , it 's like this special type of a hangover , which should be associated with a place _ like _ vegas . 
  and bangkok is one of those places , where crazy-ass shit can easily happen ( quality time in nana plaza ) . 
  far more nonsensical is `` szklana pu\u0142apka '' , which is a perfect title for the firs die hard movie ( seriously , it 's a great title - that skyscraper ** was ** a `` glass trap '' ) . 
  but with the second one ... also - `` orbitowanie bez cukru '' is pretty clever and `` podziemny kr\u0105g '' sounds better than `` klub walki '' ( which sounds like some lame kyokushin karate club full of five year old kids ) . 
  good translation should n't be literal . 
  in that case we 'd need bulgaria too , then we 'd be v8 !, 
  vroom !, 
  vroom !, 
  just like finland !, 
  it just would n't be relatable for polish customers . 
  if you want to sell tampons , you would n't advertise it by showing both genders equally using them , would you ? 
  98-99 % people in poland are white , half of them men . 
  i bet there would be no problem , if they 've removed white woman and inserted a black girl to advertise it in zambia ... 
   why would anybody eat coal ? 
  digestive issues ? 
  and we gave them cucumbers ( or at least german gurken comes from polish/sorbian og\u00f3rek / g\u00f3rka ) . 
  but they forgot about the new [ british anthem ] ( https://youtu.be/433owxh1pie?t=1m3s ) . 
  in this case it 's po government . 
  taboo . 
  there probably are some nudist beaches , but they 're rare . 
  changing in a locker room ( like getting completely naked in front of other people ) or being completely naked in sauna is something i have n't seen in poland . 
  we cover ourselves with towels in those situations . 
  there is no ofe money ... 
  yyyyrek is the second post-big brother film , the first one was `` gulczas a jak my\u015blisz '' and also was crap . 
  but in an amusing way , i 've seen it multiple times , it 's on par with `` the room '' as it comes for indolence . 
  and yyyyrek is even worse , and not as charming as gulczas . 
  it 's not weird . 
  poland was destroyed after the deluge - and it was also the end of total religious freedom . 
  protestants allied with sweden against poland ( not all of them , but that was the perception of loyalists ) . 
  poland was attacked by protestant sweden , protestant siebenburg/transylvania , protestant brandenburg , protestant janusz radziwi\u0142\u0142 led the anti-commonwealth forces ( he wanted lithuania for himself ) , orthodox moscow has also participated ... 
  it 's hard not to get a little paranoid if every protestant neighbour you have attacks you and destroys the country . 
  after that event we 've never recovered . 
  you do n't drink wine with dinner ? 
  or w\u00f3dka for digestion ? 
  or moonshine for courage ? 
  or beer not to get dehydrated ? 
   i was in there when there was also a group from israel . 
  groups of israeli students are the worst . 
  they have little to none respect both to the place and to poles . 
  half of the polish citizens that were murdered by nazis were ethnic poles , the other half were ethnic jews , yet israelis are in a denial ... as for s-21 tuol sleng in phnom penh - well , it 's pretty disturbing . 
  i have n't been to the killing fields though . 
  they 're buried . 
  even if they were forced and escaped the very next day after arrival - we 'd have to pay for them . 
  not culture , but common identity . 
  look at malaysia , which consists of the same ethnicities as singapore ( in different proportions ) but has higher crime rates . 
  malay supremacism is a constitutional doctrine of malaysia , [ satu malaysia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o5un_7jw2w&amp;ab_channel=honey1681 ) and malaysian identity are really weak . 
  ~ ~ satu ~ ~ [ one singapore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atzmmtyks7e&amp;ab_channel=ndpeeps ) is far stronger concept . 
  despite singapore being less democratic than malaysia ( look at their legislatures ... singapore has practically one-party system ) . 
  dude , a brigade is a brigade , not an army . 
  it 's as if you 've moaned about 10 bucks being worth 10 bucks ... and cooperation ( especially miliatary , with country that is n't in nato but is fighting against russian agression ) is n't a thing that could be done in a week , we need to create smaller units . 
  moreover - their aim is n't creating a joint army but creating an opportunity to future possibility of cooperation in case of a larger conflict . 
  it 's important to know weaknesses and strengths of your allies and friends firsthand . 
  he describes chauvinism , not nationalism . 
  nationalism argues for nation-states . 
  i 'm a nationalist to some degree ( i strongly believe that ethnic factor is the most important one in setting borders and national self-determination should be a core value in state-building ) but i 'm not a chauvinist , i do n't believe my nation is better than others . 
  matches take place 200 meters from my home . 
  i. . . do n't care that much , i see people going there ( duh ) but i do n't hear people talking about it at all . 
  handball is somewhat popular , but it 's nonexistent comparing to football and even volleyball . 
  czechia is a fine country with good industry and interesting culture . 
  calling it `` poor and backward '' is ignorant - just because their gdp per capita is lower than germany does n't mean it 's a bad place to live ( considering the events of last two years i 'd say that atm it 's a better place to live ) . 
  what mate ? 
  you 're serious ? 
  but ben kenobi was n't a sith , mate . 
  and there 's [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aifdxuro01y&amp;ab_channel=youmalyy5 ) . 
  actually , pre-war syria was a decent place with good education level ( compared to the rest of the middle east ) and okayish literacy rate . 
  situation in countires like afghanistan , yemen , and some sub-saharan states is far worse ( and most of them were british or french colonies ) . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-10/s-p-granted-top-grades-to-doomed-lehman-cdo-as-downgrades-rose http://www.reuters.com/article/us-s-p-settlement-iduskbn0l71c120150203 s&p is a criminal organization . 
  they purposefully kept ratings of companies like lb high , despite knowing they will go bankrupt . 
  polish sejm is much more interactive . 
  i 'm sorry for being lazy . 
  got it . 
  that means you 've never been in rural areas around krak\u00f3w or rzesz\u00f3w ... and there are differences between pronounciation in krak\u00f3w and warsaw . 
  kartofle is how you call potatoes in \u015al\u0105sk , grule in podhale . 
  ( source : half of my family is from \u015al\u0105sk and i grew up in zakopane ) . 
  still bordering russia ... yay ... 
  and they may say that without a strainer he becomes unrecognizable . 
  there is no direct corellation between wealth and crime . 
  the lowest crime ratings in poland are in podkarpackie and the highest in warsaw and \u015bl\u0105skie . 
  different ways of internalization of a norm . 
  japanese culture is very oriented on external factors ( losing face ) , whereas polish culture is oriented on internal factors ( it 's a sin , morally wrong ) . 
  very organized social structure and fear of ostracism is why there are so few thefts in japan ( you have to be in an organized crime structure to be a criminal in japan - and it 's everywhere , just read on judo federation and its links to organized crime ) . 
  ostracism is n't that big a deal in poland , we are pretty forgiving as people and societal norms are pretty loose and there are enviroments where stealing is n't that big a deal ( think trailer park boys ) . 
  pis had years to prepare and they did . 
  they are the strongest party in the field of think-tanks and think-tank activities . 
  `` polska wielki projekt '' was probably the biggest event organized yearly by an ngo in poland ( except for charities ) . 
  po had so many fractions that they had to please everyone . 
  that led to completely misearble ministers ( remember `` terenia '' from ministry of internal affairs ? ) . 
  i do n't agree with everything that pis does ( as a lawyer i have different opinions on penal procedure for example ) . 
  but demonizing them is useless . 
  their ideas are n't undemocratic , they 're not going to destroy our economy . 
  gazeta wyborcza 's hysteria has done more harm to our economy than actual doings of pis . 
  i thought that eurodisco is dead . 
  it seems that it 's actually ... undead . 
  my fav is bo\u017cydar - means `` god 's gift '' ( and there 's even a jew in it ) . 
  s&p is reliable ? 
  oh , so that 's why they had to pay 1.5 bln usd for one of the biggest fuck-ups in recent history ? 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-s-p-settlement-iduskbn0l71c120150203 ), 
  yeah , i was thinking about it and i think that sources of terrorism are a crucial point , but i would n't divide them simply as internal/external . 
  bear in mind that leftist terrorism was sponsored and inspired by soviets and their allies ( like financing baader-meinhof group by stasi ) . 
  but yeah , it is worth remembering that some of those attacks were done by jihadists , some by commies and some by nationalists .
