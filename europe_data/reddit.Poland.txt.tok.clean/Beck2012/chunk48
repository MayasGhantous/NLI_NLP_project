  it 's not even `` left '' . 
  it 's `` christian democrats '' . 
  po is in the same europarty as cdu ( and , tbh , fidesz ) . 
  one of the reasons why pis is considered as a pariah is because they 're in a group with tories ( also pariah 's ) . 
  and pis would fit like a glove in epp ( despite everything is said in western media , they 're pretty much pro-eu , they even support eu army ) , but they 've decided to join forces with tories , because they did n't want to be in one group with po . 
  i fell only once on the ice in the morning . 
  ukip is n't as well established in the political scene of the uk as the fn is in france , that 's the main issue . 
  orban is pragmatic . 
  there was no prawda in poland too . 
  but it ** was ** a propaganda outlet for the former government . 
  the play is the same , the only thing that has changed are actors . 
  and we should also add ppp . 
  ppp is important . 
  not in the parliament . 
  there several sites like that ( dotpay comes to my mind ) , but obtaining a virtual pre-paid card is easy , quick and free in at least several banks . 
  i ca n't imagine using the internet without it . 
  but our fasting does n't mean `` do n't eat or drink all day , and after dark eat and drink till you puke '' . 
  we just have to restict ourselves according to our will ( like no sweets or no alcohol ) , it 's pretty individual . 
  his nick is plugawy n\u0119dznik , so ... 
  yeah , it 's not that great , but it 's because they released it everywhere at once . 
  and i think it was a smart move , they 'll get so much cash , they 'll be able to localize . 
  and the price is n't that high to begin with . 
  get the 12 euro package , find three mates who are willing to pay 3 euro each , and you 're set . 
  why seven ? 
  and those are n't seven largest eezs , but seven largest european eezs . 
  polish and czech/slovak ? 
  we all have some degree of language exposure , so we can understand each other to a degree ... 
  better than biedaszyby . 
  it 's also strange that nobody got shit-face drunk , it 's the most beloved european tradition !, 
  and a pre-kebab-eating ritual . 
  larix decidua polonica , or polish larch . 
  the worst fucking tree ever . 
  the most useless coniferous tree ever - it looses all its leaves . 
  and it 's ugly . 
  fuck larches . 
  so do we !, 
  birch juice !, 
  after krak\u00f3w , sure . 
  paris , the city of shopping cart corn cobs ... 
  guys , you should export more stuff to us . 
  we 'll buy that shit . 
  the only thing about poland is the lead and the first two paragraphs . 
  80 % is about germany and slovakia . 
  wtf ? 
  it 's suddenly popular to throw shit at us , even if an article is about other countries ? 
  i think they know best if they earn less or more ... 
  sneaky latvia ... also , this article does n't provide any data to support the statement . 
  afaik our exporters found different partners in other countries and our economy is steadily growing . 
   because i 'm not convinced that the `` we 'll gladly take all the ukrainians '' talk of some eastern europeans on here is really to be believed . 
  it has already happened , just in poland the number of ukrainians is getting close to a million . 
  and we can take more of them , as long as they 're ready to work or study ( which they do ) . 
  pis is n't eurosceptic , they even support joint eu army ... kaczy\u0144ski has said that he wants eu to be a superpower with army as strong as the us , duda also supports eu army ( as a part of nato ) . 
  in polish it 's [ `` german camps '' ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/obozy_niemieckie_1933%e2%80%931945 ) . 
   or contemporary polish concentration camps oh yeah , those . 
  usually we call them `` cia secret bases '' , not kls . 
  \u767d\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af or b\u00e1i ' \u00e9lu\u00f3s\u012b . 
  \u7f57\u65af part is basically phonetic , it probably does n't mean anything . 
  fun fact : \u4fc4 means russia and \u997f means hungry . 
  both are `` e '' , but on different tones . 
   interesting , why do they think that spain should annex portugal ? 
  because of imperial mindset . 
  [ paderewski in pozna\u0144 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/63bgvhe.jpg ) - one of the most crucial moments of the process of regaining our independence . 
  world-famous pianist and composer ignited events that led to the only fully successful polish insurections . 
  [ za\u015blubiny polski z morzem ] ( http://i.imgur.com/irtt4tl.jpg ) - marriage of poland with the sea performed by general j\u00f3zef haller . 
  access to the baltic sea was a thing of national pride and national security for our ancestors . 
  [ 1970 seaside massacre ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ob99lin.jpg ) - communist government used force to crush the protest . 
  [ 1981 , martial law ] ( http://www.foto-kurier.pl/public/upload/cogdziekiedy_2011/pitowski-s_1.jpg ) - `` moscow '' cinema , movie promoted - `` apocalypse now '' . 
  and something more colorfull - [ ski jumps in 2002 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dcbvkqq.jpg ) in my hometown , zakopane . 
  i know that i did n't include any photos from the 90s or noughties ( smolensk crash photos , visits of john paul ii and many others ) . 
  100 years in 5 photos is impossible , 100 years ago poland was divided between germany , austria and russia ... 
  nope , the air was very clean on that day . 
  i came to krak\u00f3w on nye , it was a shock for my lungs ... 
  yep . 
  that 's why it 's best to visit in october . 
  edit : oooo , i see what you did there ... 
  not anymore . 
  :-d but yeah , when ma\u0142ysz was huge and ski jumping competitions were reactivated , around 40 000 people were watching ski jumping on the wielka krokiew . 
  and tens of thousands just came to zakopane for the atmosphere . 
  it did increase , yes . 
  my hometown . 
  on the nye there are 250 000 tourists in the town and villages around . 
  yep ... 
  because it was sponsored by government for years , despite being a private paper . 
  he 's aiming for presidency . 
  that 's because they did n't have president . 
  president chooses 2 members of national broadcasting council ( senate 1 , sejm 2 ) and approves shortening of any member 's tenure . 
  yeah , i support pis and duda , but this `` 14 minutes '' thing is a lie . 
  it is . 
  the same happened when po came to power , with dozens of journos being kicked out . 
  it 's an `` all-or-nothing '' game and it wo n't change . 
  thankfully private outlets are pretty diversified ( tvn 24 for liberals and lefties , tv republika for conservatives and righties , and several other stations ) . 
  there is a chance that there will be some kind of pluralism . 
  but journos that go on streets and protest against the new government will be sacked . 
  it was a common wealth of its citizens . 
  we have to build pipes from those plants to the building with all those ac units facing out , it will be warmer there and water will evaporate . 
  to be clear - it was created by czech priest and german gravediggers . 
  why i 'm not surprised by this fact ... 
  henryk siemiradzki - [ example ] ( http://www.pinakoteka.zascianek.pl/siemiradzki/images/dirce.jpg ) jan matejko - [ example ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/jan_matejko-astronomer_copernicus-conversation_with_god.jpg ) , [ example 2 ] ( http://www.playpoland.org.uk/files/movies/org/1343301292.jpg ) / u/sorusoranadam has already mentioned edward hopper , nighthawks is probably my favourite painting of all times . 
  oh , i also love delacroix . 
  it 's for christmas eve , we 're catholic , we do n't eat meat for christmas eve ( fasting day - actually , church no longer requires it , but at this point , it 's a tradition ) .
