  we eat fuckload of meat on 25th and 26th . 
  and it 's just one course , traditionally , there should be 12 dishes ( one for every apostle ) . 
  soup is one of them , traditional polish dinner always comes with soup - christmas eve is not an exception . 
  not rye flour , bu wheat flour . 
  rye flour is for \u017curek . 
  but it is . 
  except for fish , we do n't eat meat on the christmas eve . 
  two days that follow are a meat-feast ( ham , duck , goose , turkey , rabbit ... ) , but christmas eve is traditionally a fasting day ( no longer a christmas fast , but most people still do n't eat any meat ) . 
  we did the shitting one ( when i was a kid every toilet had a shelf ) , drink fizzy water and dar bread is becoming more , and more popular . 
  not exactly . 
  there is a lot of great and amazing examples of brutalism , and a lot of `` commie blocks '' are n't brutalism at all . 
  most of bulidings posted in this thread are n't made of raw concrete , which is the main idea behind brutalism ( `` le beton brute ! '' ), 
  nowa huta is awesome . 
  and it was n't as communist as soviets and our imported commies wanted . 
  ptaszycki was a great planner and architect , nowa huta has more to do with a garden-city than ideal socialist city . 
  blocks are n't that big , there is a lot of space for people to spend their free time . 
  the only thing that it lacked were churches ( even though original plan included a church on a majakowskiego/marksa ) , but people demanded places of worship , so even commies had to accept their wish . 
  exactly , ukrainian minority in poland was miniscule two years ago . 
  after russian aggression , the influx is huge . 
  exactly , it 's one of those myths about western and northern poland . 
  lubuskie , zachodniopomorskie , warmi\u0144sko mazurskie are among poorest and the most sparsely populated voievodships . 
  yep , usually - remember that both [ sayyid qutb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sayyid_qutb ) and [ saloth sar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pol_pot ) were studying in the west . 
  i am not saying that that 's the case in this situation , contrary - i fully support granting scholarships to ukrainian students , i know quite a lot of them myself . 
  but it 's good that you 've added `` usually '' , because there are some tragic examples of destructive role of people who learned in the west . 
  yeah , we call italy w\u0142ochy and rome rzym . 
  it 's not like in english it 's marlkar and marklar ... 
  `` capital of europe '' . 
  it 's a dystopian future , mate . 
  mona lisa overdrive . 
  economy of scale . 
  the same thing is happening with commie china right now . 
  half of pre-war commonwealth of poland ( :  ) was swamps , 100 % of it was a former warzone , it was made up from 3 diffrent countries with different laws , currencies and even rail width . 
  ussr was a vast country with insane resources . 
  it 's hard to fuck up n this part of world , yet they manage to do so . 
  if you knew polish , you 'd know that we especially hate ourselves . 
  and he is a poorly educated leftist , is n't he ? 
  new terminal in krak\u00f3w is awesome . 
  train to the city centre is for 4 euro , everything is shiny and new . 
  i also like helsinki - not too big , automatic passport check ( you go to a booth , it scans your passport and face - done , no need for human interactions ) . 
  cheap supermarket in the building ( if you have time to go through passport check and want to eat/drink something - it 's a good idea to go there ) . 
  and it 's not too big . 
  and finnair is cheap . 
  yep , it 's blown out of proportion . 
  anti-government rallies were bigger when po was the ruling party ( together with psl ) . 
  it 's normal and healthy that people are free to express their opinions . 
  i do n't agree with protesters , i support pis , but i 'm happy they can march under their banners . 
  even if i ca n't stand journos and politicians that are leading the crowd , i know that they ca n't stand people that won the election . 
  that 's the nature of democracy . 
  even if their rethorics is hysterical , it 's their right . 
  kyiv 5 years ago was awful . 
  no one spoke english , laides at a counter were tending their children rather than helping apssangers . 
  it was a mess . 
  krak\u00f3w airport is cool , beer for 5 z\u0142oty is awesome ( 80 eurocents ) . 
  and we have a new terminal . 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa 's going nuts , he 's scared that people will stop lsitening to him , after he lost cases both with wyszkowski and cenckiewicz . 
  there is no one to protect him from claims that he was a registered secret informer of sb in the 1970s ... and he was , see the last court rulings , it 's legal to call him tw bolek and he can not do anything to you . 
  he even changed his matra recently - it used to be `` i did n't collaborate , it 's a lie '' and now it 's `` i did n't collaborate with them - they collaborated with me !, 
  by media and post-communist elites . 
  when i see former party members `` defending democracy '' , i wan na barf . 
  and the counter-demonstration right after the recent protest was bigger than the one that was `` sold outside '' by leftist journos . 
  and as for assassinations - / u/perkel666 , the last political assassination in poland was on a member of pis in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a . 
  some guy went to one of pis mp offices and shot a guy that worked there ( he wanted to shoot an mp , but mp was n't there ) . 
  exactly . 
  moreover - that colonel was not following direct orders , that 's why military police had to react . 
  more context : his acreditation was revoked a week ago !, 
  this guy for last week was coming to his former job pretending he 's still working there . 
  so military police came and changed locks . 
  the first part is true - the second not . 
  apart from ridiculous comment about sb , those hours apply only to search of a dwelling , not to an office . 
  and this office was n't closed at that hour . 
  it 's easy to shout phrases like `` eurosceptics '' all around , but they 're not eurosceptics at all . 
  they 've supported the idea of joint eu army and lisbon treaty . 
  they 're against adopting euro and made some superficial changes ( like no eu flags in certain places - it 's aimed at eurosceptic crowd , they try not to encourage any political movements right to them to grow in strength ) . 
  they 're incredibly pro-intermarium , they 're the dream-government of poland for countries from estonia , through romania and even georgia , because they stick to the pi\u0142sudski 's idea of intermarium . 
  the main idea is that poland should be able to defend itself and also should form closer ties with not only v4 , but also baltic republics , romania , bulgaria , western balkans and georgia ( preferably sweden , finland and norway too ) with a support of the usa . 
  this article is a joke . 
  russian , czech ... 
  even italian ( in kl metro ) . 
  parasites do not share dna with hosts , nor are of the same species . 
  skin cells are not alive . 
  op is asking for an advice regarding a criminal act . 
  / u/culmensis is suggesting a legal option . 
  you were the first culture we met that did n't use chairs . 
  the same goes for colonists and indians . 
  translation inspired by james may . 
  yeah , it 's far better than the previous one . 
  and the music used in `` pan twardowsky '' is awesome , some of the best songs that our popculture has to offer ( and one of the worst , ofc ) . 
  and from more modern songs - every year pr3 ( `` tr\u00f3jka '' , polish radio three ) releases a christmas album . 
  and the most important song is `` karp '' , every year it 's different . 
  my favourite is [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu7lqyf0phc&amp;ab_channel=klossser ) from 2011 . 
  [ this year 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1ohp_r-ly&amp;ab_channel=polskieradio ) is called `` karpate szcz\u0119\u015bcie '' , or ... `` carpy luck '' ? 
  i think ... `` karpate '' is a neologism , so it 's hard to translate . 
  and it 's a pun , because we have a phrase `` garbate szcz\u0119\u015bcie '' , `` hunchback luck '' . 
  one of the factors is the fact , that typical male jobs are far more dangerous . 
  including serving in the army . 
  women get some priviliges because they get pregnant and have babies . 
  men do n't , so in the time when our wives can not work , we can - priviliges are balancing natural inequality between men and women ( because of pregnancy and then having an infant , which should be brest-fed , women are more vulnerable ; in the same time men just function as they would normally do , except for assisting their wives ) . 
  i , as a man , have no problem with lack of equality in this regard ( retirement and such ) . 
  more problematic is the fact that it 's virtually impossible for a man to get the custody of a child after a divorce , and that violence against husband is treated as a joke ... 
  see , i do n't agree with this way of thinking .
