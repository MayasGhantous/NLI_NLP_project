  but thanks . 
  i 've tried , it does n't seem to work . 
  i do n't like gombrowicz at all , and love sienkiewicz . 
  but i adore 19th century novels , so there 's that . 
  [ * the deluge * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_deluge_ ( novel / ) ) by henryk sienkiewicz - great classic novel , by great polish author ( nobel prize winner ! ) . 
  he got nobel for * quo vadis * , which is set in roman emperor 's nero times . 
  for a modern book - * the witcher * . 
  that 's probably the first time i see an article from msn linked . 
  it does . 
  and while i like some pinta , paying 8 pln for half liter is too much to drink it regularly . 
  for the same cash i can get a fourpack of okocim in freshmarket . 
  and lager is lager - usually there is no diffrence between lager beers , it 's diffrent with ipas or baltic porters . 
  i mean 1 point diffrence . 
  look at estonia and latvia . 
  little men waiting for their green costumes . 
  but wine , whisky and gin are n't something that they ( hm , we ) do n't drink at all . 
  no , they were n't . 
  vietnam was allied with ussr , there was even a prc-vietnamese war . 
  they were ( and still are ) at least rivals , if not enemies . 
  we 've diversified our drinking needs . 
  beer , w\u00f3dka , wine , whisky , gin . 
  i 'll drink anything and wo n't flinch doing it . 
  well , just because we invented w\u00f3dka , does n't mean we have to be in w\u00f3dka belt . 
  americans invented nuclear weapons , yet ruskies has got more warheads . 
  also , there is this old joke , that bicycle was discovered by russian scientist sgt. 
  titov in an attic in lublin . 
  they focus on british people coming to krak\u00f3w for stag parties , running with naked butts and puking all over the place . 
  the only thing that gets bashed in the media ( rightly so ) is drunk driving . 
  and you ca n't drink in public space in poland , although beer is fairly cheap and good ( with increasing variety in regional beers and microbreweries ) , vast majority of people do n't have problem with drinking beer or partying . 
  i 'd even say , that both media and public opinion are more acepting towards drinking than 10 years ago ( we were a beer country for hundreds of years , although we invented w\u00f3dka , it 's something that should be used as a celebratory drink , not as casualy as beer - vodka drinking began in 19th century , when it was cheaper than water - it was literally given free to peasants ; then , vodka drinking became popular again during communism , because there was a big shortage of beer ) . 
  the same goes with poland and lithuania , funny coincidence . 
  anyway , central europe is beer europe . 
  the same goes with poland and lithuania , funny coincidence . 
  anyway , central europe is beer europe .

  but jakub was popular when i was born . 
  i 'm 24 and i know a lot of guys named jakub . 
  for girls in my age anna is the most popular . 
   vietnam and china ( comrades ) fight over sea rights . 
  they never were `` comrades '' . 
  yep . 
  but both slavic and baltic languages are the closest to indo-aryan root , which is pretty interesting . 
  it 's sunday , so yeah , probably . 
  at seven or eight in the morning ? 
  was this heino at 0:27 ? 
  no , warsaw is worse than krak\u00f3w . 
  people from warsaw do n't even [ wash their hands ] ( http://fromwarsawwithlove.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/toilet_wawel1.jpg ) . 
  we do n't have an embassy there . 
  kl covers philippines . 
  probably . 
  other fascinating person was erzherzog wilhelm franz joseph karl von habsburg-lothringen , who was a ukrainian nationalist : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archduke_wilhelm_of_austria, 
  w\u00f3dka to w\u00f3dka . 
  the most famous polish admiral was born in delft , netherlands . 
  but he moved to gda\u0144sk in 1608 . 
  his name was arendt dijckman and he died after winning a battle against sweden . 
  he was probably killed by accidental fire from our vessel , `` flying deer '' . 
  :-( second famous was vice-admiral j\u00f3zef unrug , who was born german , but during 2nd ww he did n't want to speak german at all , so his captors had to use a translator to communicate with him ( although his polish apparently was n't that good ) . 
  he told his german family ( prussian aristocracy ) that with 1st september , he forgot , how to speak german . 
  he 's one of my personal heroes . 
  [ found on twitter ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bx5ttwzieaajydt.jpg ) . 
  sure . 
  we 've been a state for about two weeks , so we have some experience . 
  [ everyone hates flanders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usml1mlqlfw ) . 
  exactly , he 's one of the most resourceful politicans in free poland . 
  the only one that survived clash with tusk . 
  the fact , that he got one of three most prestigious positions in cabinet , shows that he 's both influencial and skilled . 
  as for sikorski beign competent - i 'd argue , our non-european foreign politics are pretty much non-existent , we ca n't even open an embassy in philippines ( it has been `` work in progress '' for last decade ) . 
  he has some skill in european affairs , but both administration of ministry and non-european relations could be ( should be ! ), 
  better . 
  no , it did n't . 
  that 's like saying that common european currency started with reichsmark in 1940 . 
  and political persecution for having a car ( my grandpa was fired , he worked as a prosecutor in late 50s , early 60s , because his dad bought him a car ) . 
  but he still is a taxi-driver , who bought his second cab ( the first one was polonez ) in late 1990s . 
   the far left ( which is the successor of the former ruling communist party of east germany ) is only really succesful in the east where it ranges around 20 % , in the west just around 5 % . 
  and in saarland . 
  one of theories is that those people 's self-identity is weaker . 
  close to 80 % of people living in former germany , were forcibly resettled there from kresy : lithuania , belarus and ukraine . 
  we do n't talk about it . 
  surprise commonwealth , best commonwealth . 
  do n't laugh , your head of state was a seaman . 
  if someone finds other sources - please , post them . 
  i do n't know how reliable is my source ( it was posted by a director of bielsat on twitter ) . 
  i 'm from zakopane ( but i 'm not a highlander - it 's basically an ethnic minority , they are descendants of vlachs ) . 
  zakopane is really charming and nice - but not in a high season !, 
  if you come in may , when we have 250 000 tourists , you 're gon na regret that ( city itself is 26 000 , so there are roughly 10 tourists per resident ) . 
  there is tonnes of nice architecture , mountains are nice and it 's pretty damn cheap . 
  lots of places , where you can eat for 3 euros and drink a beer for less than 2 euros . 
  come in a winter-time , before christmas , or in october . 
  it 's lovely . 
  and hopefully there will be culture park in a few years , so there will be no more flashy billboards and such . 
  i know one word . 
  means beer . 
  [ according to this map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novorossiya#mediaviewer/file:mapa_regi%c3%b3n_novorrosiya.png ) lpr and dpr are east from new russia . 
  `` witch hunt '' is a bad term . 
  it 's bad , because it denotes the neccessity of proper investigation . 
  we are facing the same opponent , as the former 1st world and democratic opposition in occupied/sattelite states of soviet union faced two decades ago . 
  lack of general vetting in many countries - of people who may have worked with communist secret police , or intelligence , was a grave danger for years . 
  and still is - not that big , but it 's still possible that active spies are in influencial positions . 
  now , if there is any doubt of someone 's loyalty and truthfulness , that person should be checked .
