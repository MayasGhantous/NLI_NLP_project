  there are several things important to remember : the right of pardon in a way that president used it was n't used before , but there is no law that forbids him from doing so ( it was n't a breach of law , it was a breach of a custom ) . 
  as for the tribunal - the judges that were appointed would become judges only after a pledge . 
  pis pushed for its own judges ( which is n't that big of shock , considering that atm the tribunal is controlled by po , with po ex-politicians in it ) and president took the pledge from them first , so they became new judges . 
  the case with the verdicts of polish contitutional tribunal is , that they ( generally ) have no retroactive power . 
  all the actions of pis are based on this idea . 
  i do n't agree with what they did - it 's very shortsided and , as a lawyer , i think that sticking to customs is an important thing ( especially in case of a party that likes to call itself conservative ) . 
  but i do n't think they 've broken polish law . 
  i know i 'm in a minority , but as always with law - there are diffrent opinions on matters like this . 
  it is n't , it 's more of a fidesz situation . 
  i agree that they break some of the parliamentary customs , but they do n't break the law and are n't `` a threat to our democracy '' . 
  i still support pis , especially when i see faces of blokes like kalisz in this crowd . 
  i think that polarization has reached a new high in poland ... pis still remains the most popular party , opposition is divided and weak - po is a sinking ship , petru has a great chance to create a real , functioning party . 
  hah , i 've just heard an argument of one of the protestors : `` the fact , that pis won elections , does n't mean that they have a right to change the law ! '', 
  well ... 
  that 's because : a ) he was shitty president and is extremely conflicted with current ruling party leader ( who was one of his main advisors at a time ) , b ) accusations of collaboration with the secret police ( and he probably did so in the 1970s - last year court ruling ) . 
  geez , mate , your arse must be in pain . 
  / u/jacekplacek is right , no need to be passive-aggresive . 
  and those are differences that matter ** a lot ** . 
  i agree on containing this mass migration in the source , but we have to know this source , not just shout some random ethnicities/languages . 
  ransoms are almost always paid . 
  and countries/companies have to pay them - countries are obliged to protect their citizens , and companies need employees . 
  the only other way is to provide navy escorts , which is far more expensive . 
  anything with husaria . 
  us beating ruskies - it would be the most enjoyable tv series i could wish for . 
  there are no separatist movements in poland . 
  there is , however , an organization arguing for autonomous upper silesia ( around 1/3 of the area shown on the map ) . 
  power plants are being modernized . 
  and they do n't emmit benzopyrene . 
  people often use wood and trash ( which is illegal ) to heat their houses . 
  that 's the real culprit . 
  joke . 
  but we had a feud with the eu comission about the amounts of benzopyrene in our smoked products . 
  and we eat smoked meats on daily basis . 
  that 's because of kie\u0142basa and szynka . 
  uk - good tv . 
  italy - good pasta . 
  our jews also played on [ cymba\u0142y ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq-vmzcja3y&amp;ab_channel=wolacco ) . 
  means dick in polish . 
  nerves !, 
  we play on nerves . 
  for me that does n't matter . 
  investigations were a joke , ruskies even mistook bodies of victims ( families could n't open caskets before funerals , there had to be court-allowed exhumations ) , we got black box copy , not original recordings . 
  officials responsible for safety of this flight were promoted ( chief of government security agency became a general , this scum arabski was sent as an ambassador to spain ) . 
  it was outrageous . 
  i do n't believe in the assasination theories , i know that both russian and polish investigations were a joke , we need an international comission . 
  funfact - chief of russian comission , tatiana anodina , apparently fled russia and is hiding in france ... 
  mieczys\u0142aw fogg [ ostatnia niedziela ] ( https://youtu.be/n-hg58qqmdc ) , czes\u0142aw niemen [ bema pami\u0119ci rapsod \u017ca\u0142obny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffnxafy6dby&amp;ab_channel=julianewa ) ( he starts singing around 4:30 , it 's actually a 19th century poem about general bem , depressing stuff ) , andrzej ko\u0142akowski [ epitafium dla majora ognia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1infe0sd-q&amp;ab_channel=polskipatriotand ) ( about a controversial soldier , who kept fightin after 1945 ) , katy carr [ ma\u0142a little flower ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0jo_53y1jg&amp;ab_channel=katycarr ) , lao che [ koniec ] ( https://youtu.be/g9sjgereaqi ) ( `` powstanie warszawskie '' or `` warsaw uprising '' is pretty depressing ) . 
  and there 's the last one , which everyone refuses to eat . 
  unless all the people are good friends , in that case it 's a race - who 'll eat the last one . 
  it will probably get shattered and turn into little bits . 
  edit : but yeah , it 'll be opened right away . 
  for me wa\u0142brzych will be the synonym for poverty in poland . 
  it might have changed a bit with all this gold train thing , but stories about `` palestine '' neighbourhood with 60 % unemployment are still vivid . 
  it was also known thanks to `` biedaszyby '' , `` povertyshafts '' , people who were illegaly mining coal in primitive shafts that often collapsed . 
  jesus , did you even check how much we 've [ improved ] ( https://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;idim=country:pol:deu:rus&amp;hl=pl&amp;dl=pl ) ? 
  we 've lowered our emission despite rapid gdp growth !, 
  our emission per capita is lower than germany 's despite our energy production being 80 % coal based !, 
  our country 's flat - water is not a good source of power ; wind is not as strong as on the north sea 's coast - wind is not a good source of power ; for half a year it 's cold , rainy and cloudy - sun is not a good source of power ; we do n't have any nuclear plants ( but we might have a deal with chinese , we 'll know in few days ) . 
  our oil and natural gas production is low , shale gas reserves were overestimated . 
  but we have shitload of coal , 12th biggest reserves in the world , 2nd biggest in eu ( after de ) . 
  we do n't have much choice . 
  from january to june of this year poland has issued 403 thousand work permits for ukrainians . 
  add to that refugees from ukraine ( we 've just taken in refugees from mariupol , earlier there were refugees from territories controlled by terrorists ) , around 25 thousand students from ukraine , immigrants from other countries ( mainly belarus and russia ) . 
  the understanding of `` nationalist '' in europe is a tad different , most people perceive it to be closer to xenophobic , radical right ideology . 
  which is , of course , an oversimplification . 
  but it 's hard to discuss with general populace . 
  i am catholic , therefore i am western . 
  dude , there is tons of papers - you can buy antisemitic bullcrap released by bubel , leftist shit released by urban et consortes , liberal catholic tygodnik powszechny , conservative catholic go\u015b\u0107 niedzielny , jewish midrasz , centre-left polityka , centre-right do rzeczy , egotistic lisweek ( hurr-durr ) . 
  there 's a lot to choose from . 
  the same goes with tv - there 's not only liberal tvn24 , you have more diversified polsat news and conservative republika . 
  hajdarowicz has fired a lot of people from rzeczpospolita two years ago ( `` trotyl '' case ) - court decided that he did n't have right to do so . 
  but after that they just started their own weekly and own television , that was brilliant . 
  there was a raid on wprost when they released first tapes . 
  and what has happened ? 
  nothing much , they did n't give up and new tapes appear all the time . 
  former government tried to silence them but they could n't do so by legal means - and thank god they were sane enough to just criticize them on tv . 
  it was a marketing stunt , nothing more . 
  they said that they hired czech porn actors/actresses , because polish theatrical actors are not skilled enough to shag on the scene . 
  turns out there 's no real sex , but the tickets are sold out months ahead . 
  good for them . 
  but both po ( on regional level ) and pis ( on national level ) protested against showing live sex in a theatre . 
  and it 's completely understandable for me , it 's not a thing that should happen . 
  it does n't , so there 's no case . 
  our navy has long and proud history of owning submarines . 
  i hope we 'll got some new soon enough . 
  it 's more of a gluhwein kind of festivals , you know . 
  and our grzaniec galicyjski is quite nice . 
  it starts this week , i 'm excited for it . 
  sure , that 's why they got arrested . 
  people are entitled to thei opinion . 
  i also do n't think that a subidized theatre should stage such play . 
  the nature of democracy is that people can express themselves and their opinions - it 's democracy in action . 
  people got arrested , because they went overboard with their picketing . 
  sure there are sex shops and pornocinemas , but they are n't called theatres and no tax money is given to them . 
   for example parliamentary special services committee has been always lead by an opposition member . 
  false !, 
  po introduced `` rotation '' . 
  for example - marek biernacki was a chairman of that comission ( source : http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/marek-biernacki-sekretarzem-stanu-koordynatorem-sluzb-specjalnych-3361096.html ) . 
   and do n't tell me that passing a law that invalidates pre-electoral picks for 5 constitution court judges was legit . 
  you can say the same about po picking 5 judges .
