  atm most of the members of constitution court were nominated by po-psl , some of them were po politicians ( like judge kieres : https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/leon_kieres ) . 
  jesus , `` magnificent century '' is everywhere . 
  that 's a pretty ignorant statement , mate . 
  it 's important to mention that the data is from before presidential and parliamentary elections . 
  that would mean all the medals in women 's wightlifting would go to kazakhstan ... 
  [ walking stereotype ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upvnxuxiqlg&amp;ab_channel=wwe ) in wwe . 
  some more rusev : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spyhfwfluca&amp;ab_channel=wwe i love this guy , wwe is silly . 
  kanapka is a staple of polish cuisine . 
  seriously , the first thing that poles miss is fresh bread with butter and polish ham , cheese , twar\u00f3g , some mayo ... 
  damn , i 'm hungry . 
  but tunisia is fine . 
  west has to take a proactive stance regarding syria - a constructive political change is a must . 
  that was legitness . 
  i do n't think people would mind letting refugees stay until the war is over . 
  well , after paris it might have changed . 
  it 's outright lying . 
  checking an answer online is cheating . 
  both are dishonesty , but i 'd say that the low test score in japan and avarage in korea would be more influenced by test-taking culture there . 
  but who do they boo ? 
  might the booing be aginst the terrorists ? 
  yeah , because things schulz says is a-okay . 
  turks and morrocans are also good examples . 
  erm ... 
  he understands that part of the world pretty well , he spent some time there as a diplomat . 
  and what he says is true - we , as west , are pretty darn good at destroying . 
  we can defeat anyone , anywhere in the world as nato . 
  but we have to help locals to create some structures that will bring stability to unstable regions - the best way to do it , is to help the organize and give them emans to fight for their country and against daesh . 
  units with mixed syrian/western commandment are a good idea . 
  far better than simple land invasion , which will crush daesh in few days but wo n't leave any local force with abilities to control the situation . 
  well `` symbolism '' ** is ** a poethic `` bullshit '' . 
  so saying that red on our flag symbolises blood is pretty justified . 
  krzy\u017cacy 's for children . 
  we read it when we 're 13 . 
  potop is much more interesting . 
  yep , the game includes characters from books too !, 
  19th c. 
  as a kid i loved verne , i read almost everything he wrote . 
  i also adore dumas - les trois mousquetaires is good , but count montechristo is fenomenal !, 
  there 's also [ janusz zajdel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janusz_zajdel ) , his books have been translated to hungarian , you should read them , if you like good sociological , dystopian sci-fi . 
  once again , union , mates . 
  we have no other chocie . 
  we 're catholic enough we can claim her !, 
  seriously , we should be one country . 
  there was also jan karski . 
  [ listen to this ] ( https://youtu.be/pap02us8cym ) . 
  he tried to inform roosevelt about the holocaust ... well , just listen to this ... 
  one of the many poles i 'd like to add to the list has to be [ kornel morawiecki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kornel_morawiecki ) . 
  he was our senior marshall of sejm today ( speaker of the first sejm ) . 
  he 's my personal hero . 
  i adore him , i think he 's the most admirable person alive . 
   at the end of may , 1982 , together with pawe\u0142 falicki he founded the `` organization of fighting solidarity '' which was ** a unique political opposition organization in poland and the countries of the soviet bloc ** . 
  this was because it was the only group which from the beginning of its existence ** called for an end to communism in poland ** and other soviet satellites , establishment of sovereign governments independent from moscow in them , breakup of the soviet union and ** separation of the ussr republics into new nation states , and reunification of germany within its potsdam imposed borders ** . 
  while eventually all these things in fact happened , at the time this program was seen as quite radical and unrealistic , even in dissident circles . 
   however , fighting solidarity also ** rejected the use of violence to achieve its aims ** . 
  after the declaration of martial law in poland in 1981 , morawiecki became one of the most wanted people in poland . 
  in 1984 , on the directive of general kiszczak a special team was created in the ministry of internal affairs charged with observing several dozen places in which the authorities thought he could show up . 
  there was communist celebration of 22.07.1944 . 
  i was n't . 
  but yeah , it 's best to downvote my opinion based on a recording of two officials , and one of them says that sienkiewicz 's responsible . 
  we have those already !, 
  d&d is huuuuge in poland . 
  but poles are pretty nerdy . 
  change bank . 
  with ing i do n't any pay fees for withdrawals in poland , and with t-mobile i do n't pay fees abroad ( except for those damn atm taxes in thailand ) . 
  yeah , gravy is an important part of polish cuisine . 
  turkey and beef dishes are usually roasts with gravy . 
  ( we eat turkey in poland , mate ) . 
  if you decide to produce whisky , i 'd be alright with that . 
  you already do an animal stomach filled with meat , so you do n't have to make haggis though . 
  no incidents . 
  i agree that the damage was done and some of it wo n't be fixed . 
  russians wo n't give us black boxes , nor the plane , which will stay in russia , until it rots away ... 
  the thing is - we did n't !, 
  seriously , the facts that i brought up does n't make you think that it was a huuuge fuck-up ? 
  we gave all investigative instruments to russians , who were a suspect ( i 'm not saying that they did blow up the plane - but they clearly were a suspect ) . 
  how could the investigation be solid ? 
  there are more good choices - my fav is szyma\u0144ski as minister of european affairs ( or however we 'll translate that ) . 
  but do n't you think that there were tremendous errors or insane amount of ill-will from the government side ? 
  that 's really bugging me and i hope there will be a real investigation , but i agree that this issue has been dominated by consipracy theorists and equally annoying crowd of lasek/anodina apologists . 
  20th place , the last spot . 
  but he got in with the second or the third most votes from pis in krak\u00f3w . 
  i hate to be the one to point it out - maybe , just maybe , there would be less `` conspiracy theorists '' if we did get original black boxes , not russian copies of the recording ? 
  or if we did get the wreck ? 
  or if ruskies did n't switch bodies that were immediately buried after they landed in poland ( say , how sections could have been carried out properly , if bodies were switched , huh ? 
  or why caskets were closed and not checked before burying them in the ground , so members of families had to get a permission for exhumation to confirm that they did n't bury their family but someone else ) ? 
  i doubt that there was `` an explosion '' . 
  but amount of indolence and outright ill-will from current government torwards this case is staggering . 
  he made one of the best results in poland among candidates that did n't have `` pole position '' . 
  there are two flights from helsinki each day . 
  but they had a brewery on lubicz . 
  -  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/browar_krak%c3%b3w, 
  some of those in poland do n't exist anymore ( okocim in krak\u00f3w is now a luxurious apartment building with a restaurant brewery , there is probably a dozen or more small breweries in krak\u00f3w ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqk3ne8f218&amp;ab_channel=scorpiostudio ), 
  you need some lessons in european culture . 
  clamshell 's a currency . 
  i have a shashka and always called it `` czerkieska '' , that 's how it was named in books i 've read . 
  some of the readings in china are [ fake ] ( https://www.chinadialogue.net/blog/7828-china-promises-crackdown-on-fake-air-quality-data/en ) . 
  the avarage yearly pm 2.5 in beijing is around 100 , in krak\u00f3w it 's [ lower ] ( http://www.krakow.pios.gov.pl/publikacje/2010/ocena_wstepna_pm2_5.pdf ) . 
  in industrial and residential areas the highest was 61 . 
  yeah , when i lived in kl i could see petronas towers from my office , which was located two metro stations from it .
