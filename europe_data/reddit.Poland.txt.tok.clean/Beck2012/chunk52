  after the annual haze has started ( thanks to indonesians burning jungle on sumatra ) i could barely see the closest skyscraper which was one metro station away ... 
  the same with china , i 've been on tienanmen several times , never saw mao 's mausoleum nor the monument in the centre of the square ( it 's 200 metres from the gate ? 
  something like that ) . 
  seeing `` german '' and 88 in one sentence ... yeah ... 
  [ merlion ] ( http://wheresmatthew.com/blog/media/blogs/wheresmatthew/singapore_walk04.jpg ) is a glorious beast !, 
   porcelain is very famous in asia boles\u0142awiec porcelain looks similar to ming dynasty porcelain , which was considered the best in the world . 
  and you shag sheep . 
  they sell it in poland ( in some shops in krak\u00f3w ) and it 's fucking glorious . 
  not if you 're in mountains and it snows non-stop for few weeks . 
  savages . 
  the title is bollocks . 
  it 's not `` among the worst in the world '' . 
  it 's bad , but 90 % chinese cities with  1mil pop . 
  is far worse . 
  not to mention places like new delhi or magnitogorsk . 
  krak\u00f3w 's air is n't that good , it 's a fact . 
  last few days were especially awful . 
  but saying it 's `` among the worst in the world '' is a lie . 
  few things are sure - we need metro , more tram lines , more bike lanes , communal heating in every kamienica in the centre , 3rd and 4th ring completed ( 2nd ring - `` aleja trzech wieszcz\u00f3w '' especially , is the place where pollution is the worst ) . 
  but there is still difference between krak\u00f3w and shanghai . 
  in krak\u00f3w we have few days of heavy smog a year , in shanghai they have few weeks of blue sky a year . 
  nowa huta is barely working and has to use the best possible filters available . 
  actualy air in huta is one of the best in krak\u00f3w . 
  the old city is the worst , because it 's right in the middle . 
  ros\u00f3\u0142 it 's better if you make it longer , even several hours . 
  it 's tastier . 
  it 's the same in poland , before the war , goose was eaten for our independence day on 11th of november . 
  we 're also a goose powerhouse , exporting almost all of our geese meat to germany . 
  as we 're no longer poor as heck , it 's more popular in shops ( and lidl started selling it !, 
  what lawsuits ? 
  there are no restitutions , we get reparations forom polish state - my family had a factory in lw\u00f3w and we got some money for it from polish state ( it took over 20 years to get the money ) . 
  i call bullshit on this . 
  we can agree on lachia . 
  aaand , our newly elected president duda is there ( [ link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lxaesnk.jpg ) ) . 
  brothers , stay strong and fight corruption . 
  my house in zakopane - outwards . 
  my apartment in krak\u00f3w - inwards , but the main doors to the building - outwards . 
  last week , while i was waiting for nz-aus rugby match , i saw that there was lol event transmission on tv . 
  and not on some kind of cable tv station , but in polsat sport news which is availible over-the-air everywhere in poland !, 
  i 'm dota2 guy , so i do n't follow lol scene at all , but i was pleasantly surprised . 
  harmon likes this ... [ motif ] ( http://www.junkiemonkeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rickandmortydotcom.jpg ) . 
  pick that logo and change the name of your capital to harmontown . 
  yeah , 7 's cool . 
  and i understood it without translation , which is nice . 
  where did you find 1/2 kg of chicken in chicken rice , mate ? 
  i want the adress , usually you get maybe half pound . 
  same in poland . 
  starts from 2,35 euro , up to 4,70 euro . 
  zakopane is a real city , mate . 
  we 're almost as big as olsztyn !, 
  are you a member of some organization that specializes in road `` accidents '' ? 
  the title is a lie though . 
  krak\u00f3w 's air is uncomaparable to air `` quality '' of chinese , indian or some russian cities ( magnificent [ magnitogorsk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vydifkm.png ) , a model soviet city ) . 
  hell , people who say that `` krak\u00f3w 's air quality is among the worst in the world '' should go to kl or singapore for one day and experience [ haze ] ( http://funnymalaysia.hornbill.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/haze-kuala-lumpur-june-24.jpg ) . 
  and we 're still getting fucked ( nordstream 2 ) . 
  i 'd add our arms industry , yachts and apples . 
   catholic fundamentalists as jarkacz has said , many years ago : `` the biggest threat for catholicism in poland is zchn '' . 
  they 're not catholic fundamentalists - they are supported by pretty devout catholic media like radio maryja , but they wo n't push religion down anybody 's throat , because it 's counter-productive and they know it . 
  but calling lubuskie `` more developed '' is at least misleading . 
  the most developed part of dolno\u015bl\u0105skie , beside wroc\u0142aw , has been voting for pis for years . 
  top three voievodships with highest unemployment in 2013 were either a german partition or annexed from germany in 1945 . 
  / u/perkel666 claim is false . 
  and it 's popular , because west = money , east = lice . 
  west = germoney , east = beggars . 
  which is false . 
  there is a division - more people vote pis in the east and south , and more people vote for po in the west and north . 
  but reasons are different , it 's not just `` zabory '' , it 's far more complex ( and historic deportations are way more important ! ) . 
  not to mention bullshit about rich western poland and poor eastern poland . 
  few years ago the poorest gmina in poland was in ma\u0142opolskie , near nowy s\u0105cz . 
  in the same ma\u0142opolskie we have krak\u00f3w and zakopane , which are among the most wealthy cities in poland . 
  pis won both in krak\u00f3w , and in zakopane . 
  another example i 've already mentioned - copper basin in dolno\u015bl\u0105skie is the richest region in that voievodship , yet they vote pis . 
  first time in post-communist history we 'll have a one-party government . 
  i hope they 'll do well . 
  it 's a myth . 
  pozna\u0144 , which was the biggest city of german partition which was actually ethnically polish , was supporting narodowa demokracja before the war ( they were right-wing ) . 
  most of \u015al\u0105sk , all dolny \u015al\u0105sk , lubuskie , zachodniopomorskie , most of pomorskie and warmi\u0144sko-mazurskie were settled after the war . 
  and there was no development , because after the war everything was either destroyed or stolen by soviets ( whole industry was evacuated to russia !, 
  sure , they get no seats , if they get not enough votes . 
  every national minority can have a comittee like that - belarussians used to have a member of sejm ( pose\u0142 ) , who was elected from sld ballot . 
  ] ( http://www.wyborynamapie.pl/sejm2015/sejm2015%20graf.png ) - if we count voievodships , they 're also invisible . 
  it has been explained hundreds of times - most of ex-german territories were settled by people from east of bug . 
  they were forced to do so , it was also the only place where pgr ( state farms ) were quite common ( the rest of country had privately-owned farms ) . 
  there was whole generation that lived on their suitcases , because they thought , they 'll get back to their real homes . 
  it 's other world than central and eastern part of poland . 
  as for big cities , reasons are other ( more secular society , middle class that likes neoliberal rethorics etc. 
  interesting places . 
  copper basin - one of the richest regions in poland ( polkowice have biger budget per capita than warsaw - [ link ] ( http://samorzad.pb.pl/3774901,10160,najbogatsze-gminy-miasta-i-powiaty-w-polsce-ranking ) ) . 
  there are schools that teach kashubian language , which is imo harder to understand than slovakian . 
  but they are pretty conservative and their identity is very polish . 
  german minority . 
  protestants . 
  orthodox . 
  edit : added imgur link , yay, 
  we 're too busy being catholic for things like that . 
  on wednesdays . 
  we also used to call austria rakus . 
  probably bc you guys . 
  i do n't have to read your username to know where you 're from , mate . 
  because soviet 's mass-murdered and brainwashed your people .
