  my house was n't cleaned for at least 50 years and after the cleaning it looked like new . 
  and it 's fucking solid , it was built in 1930s and everything is okay with it . 
  but nothing beats vysoke tatry . 
  \u0160trbsk\u00e9 pleso and lomnica are awesome . 
  working on it . 
  cultural park act is going to haelp administration to get rid of kitsch . 
  and if you come to zakopane off-season , it 's a magical place . 
  especially in october or november . 
  chill . 
  hi confused , i 'm dad . 
  in krak\u00f3w we have 24h liquor stores on every corner . 
  touche, 
  [ literally millionaires ] ( http://www.prohuman.sk/files/gallery_assist/1/gallery_assist1350/prev/14.jpg ) . 
  and gdr was the most oppressive out of all commie states with very strong stasi . 
  [ we do put real heroes on stamps , you moron ] ( http://i.colnect.net/images/f/439/199/witold-pilecki-1901-48.jpg ) . 
  [ context ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witold_pilecki ), 
  nope , nowadays reddit comments ( not only on this sub ) resemble youtube comments and there 's nothing we can do about it . 
  sad but true . 
  it was n't `` iamverysmart '' , he 's right . 
  wikipedia is a great tool for obtaining introductory knowledge i many fields , but it sucks as a source . 
  duh , that 's 'cause she 's [ pocahontas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4udfzegf4rm ) ... 
  it 's a puppy . 
  they grow really big and are vicious . 
  great sheepdogs , but it 's not a dog you 'd like to meet while walking your own pup . 
  the tv series ( as well as the old movie ) is very popular in poland . 
  and it 's good ( most of tv series produced back in the old days were decent - even though every other aspect of life was shit ) . 
  the music is fantastic - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1psc4bu7qty, 
  yeah , thankfully i specialize in a niche topic . 
  but i had to include two ( pretty worthless ) books , only because they were written in polish ... reviewers < 3 . 
  the closest language to polish - https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c4%99zyki_%c5%82u%c5%bcyckie, 
  huh , it 's still warm in poland , yesterday my thermometer showed +29 c. ( inside my house ) ... 
  yo there . 
  i hope to finish writing an article i 've been working on for some time , it passed the first review , so it 'll probably be published . 
  apart from that ... got ta clean my house a bit , make myself a dinner , usual stuff . 
  and i 'll probably go out grab a beer with a girl i used to go out few years ago - things did n't work out at all , but we 're still friends ( it - rarely - happens ) . 
  i have a swiss knife on me pretty often , you got ta open them bottles with something . 
  it 's also helpful with repairing a bike and bunch of other things . 
  i 've stopped using facebook years ago . 
  if someone wants to contact me - i have e-mail , phone , skype , twitter and google hangouts . 
  life 's good . 
  i 'm sure they were , but now ? 
  i know that there was a time when also mexican soaps were huge . 
  deutschland '83 is amazing , one of the best non-us series i 've ever watched ( black mirror is no . 
  when i was little we all played the game `` shoot a german '' . 
  i liked playing a german , i could screaming `` scheisse ! '', 
  a lot , which was fun . 
  i think we 're too fucking stressed . 
  i blame fucking bureaucracy for it , for the last week i was stressed as fuck , only because of unresponsive bureaucrats and arbitrary , idiotic deadlines . 
  and i 'm only talking about finishing university and applying for a phd program ... 
  i can only imagine what people doing bussiness may go through ... 
  there are vietnamese people here already , that 's a sizeable minority . 
  we have no traditions in contacts with philippines ( we do n't have embassy in manila , which is a disgrace ) , but we do have pretty warm relationships with vietnam ( due to `` socialist friendship '' , actually quite a lot of educated vietnamese speak polish , including government officials - they 've studied here ) . 
  as for india - there is small immigration of indian people to poland , mainly engineers ( at least in cracow ) . 
  because chinese lie . 
  i 've been in china , it 's incomparable . 
  relocation to the falkland isles . 
  there 's a lot of sheep there , so it 'd be humanitarian af . 
  good for them , that 's a proper maintenance . 
  die linke is post-communist , most voters are old and nostalgic after the ddr . 
  i think that a lot of them are pretty against the immigration . 
  they do n't even call themselves communist , they 're all about juche now . 
  op 's polish , mate, 
  name one . 
  the real reason is that since the time of tsars kacaps used to invest ( via okhrana/nkvd/kgb / fsb ) into radicals both internally and externally . 
  divide and conquer at it 's `` best '' , that 's why it 's such a shithole ( and we 're also affected by the vincinity ) . 
  how the fuck commemorating one of the biggest losses and atrocities that we were victims of make us forget that war is a nasty , brutal thing ? 
  ( polish ) lawyer here . 
  afaik , i 'm not a practicing lawyer , but i have a degree in law . 
  because they 've attacked polish citizens . 
  there is something called universal jurisdiction ( 113 penal code ) . 
  thanks to the european arrest warrant we could ask the uk to extradite them to us ( chapter ... 66something of penal procedure code ) . 
  fortunately for those lads , they 're underage , so it probably wo n't happen . 
  although person 15-17 yo can be treated as an adult if they 've commited a murder . 
  everything depends on the qualification of their actions - if it was a murder , or a battery with a lethal result ( there is something like this in polish penal law theory - when you did n't want to kill a person while harming them ) . 
  do n't know about widzew , but as for cracovia 's ultras - they call themselves `` jude gang '' . 
  and look at that : [ ave jude ] ( https://sportowacracovia.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/aj-awve-jude-cracovia-tysiaclecia.jpg ) . 
  or my fav : [ yeah ... ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_takzkyrthrsnwgn2pstdqptfncumy2dh.jpg ) . 
  hools gon na hool , do n't expect much logic from them - i 'm cracovia 's fan and even i am speechless . 
  and calling cracovia a jewish club is a bit misleading , it was a municipal club . 
  edit : oh , this one is great : [ hehe ] ( http://i41.tinypic.com/do6trb.jpg ) . 
  it says `` sons of the holy land , born under the right star '' . 
  kilo of potatoes costs around 20 eurocents in poland . 
  vegetables/meats/fruits are extremely cheap here . 
  you can easily prepare a meal for two ( with meat ) for 1.5 euro . 
   and even if you finally get your own family most people decide only for one child . 
  that 's why 500 + has been introduced . 
  edit : yeah , great downvotes . 
  i did n't even express my opinon on the policy , just mentioned it was the reason for introducing it . 
  poland is also active in peace-keeping missions in africa . 
  we do n't commit much , but we have sent experts and military police to several countries there . 
  because this question is ludicrous and meant to confuse respondents . 
  what ? 
  more than that , there was actually quite big group of them . 
  bell pepper is amazing . 
  he does n't know turkish , nor arabic . 
  nh is fine , it has changed a lot . 
  the only dangerous thing that you can encounter in krak\u00f3w is a piss drunk brit . 
  what the fuck ? 
  provoking ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_radio_mast it 's the second highest structure in the history , the only higher is burj khalifa .
