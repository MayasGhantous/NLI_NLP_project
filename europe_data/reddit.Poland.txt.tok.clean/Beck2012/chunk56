  warsaw radio mast collapsed 25 years ago . 
  `` the signals from its 2 megawatt transmitters could be received across essentially the entire globe . '', 
  you share three letters , that 's good enough . 
  i would n't mind if there was commonwealth instead of poland . 
  with jagie\u0142\u0142o as a leader . 
  and poland is the best civ . 
  solidarity is op . 
  there was an askreddit thread in which people have discussed the topic of the natural smell of different races . 
  apparently it is a thing ( which is n't that surprising , caucasians have different metabolism than monogoloids , some asians mentioned that we smell of diary to them ) . 
  moreover , different diet makes you smell differently . 
  and remember that people did ' t shower daily hundred years ago , so their natural smell ( or , more likely , stench ) , would be more noticable . 
  best match of the tournament so far . 
  i hope that wales will end up in the final . 
  they were occupied by czechs while we fought bolsheviks in 1919 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war . 
  and i do n't really blame them , it was a constested territory , they were smart to do so . 
  we could n't fight back , because bolsheviks were en route to the atlantic and someone had to stop them ... 
  but we ca n't , you know how expensive beans are in poland ( not to meniton things like tofu ) ? 
  meat is cheaper . 
  also in [ 1920 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw ) . 
  if warsaw fell , germany would be controlled by bolsheviks . 
  so is the uk . 
  slav who does n't know romance language/english . 
  `` mi '' would be easy to understand , but `` konsentas '' ... `` jestem kontent '' would be understandable in polish , but not for most people , and `` content '' does n't mean the same as `` to consent '' . 
  like english ? 
  pfff , most of `` anti-semitic '' tags in krak\u00f3w are `` anti-cracovia '' tags . 
  i 'm a fan of cracovia , and the club is known as a `` jewish club '' ( hools even call themselves `` judegang '' ) . 
   why care about the nation state ? 
  because the last time we lost our nation state , we were butchered by others . 
  that 's how you get bombs in trashcans ... 
   because we need a federal europe , so we can work as one on ending off-shore banking . 
  we need a federal europe , because we need to fight climate change together . 
  ( not by banning lightbulbs , but by serious investments in clean energy sources . 
  100 % renewable in 20 years ) . and we need a federal europe , so that we can stand up to multinationals . 
  that mindset is the reason why so many people are `` exiters '' . 
  eu has to be a strong organization , but not a federal country . 
  too rapid and too deep integration led uk out , if we want more friction and smaller union , sure , we can do it . 
  eu has huge support in poland , but i doubt that support for federalization is nearly as big . 
  and you have other countries , where eu is very , very unpopular right now . 
  talking about federalization only weakens the union . 
  not only that , we also host world youth day . 
  well , the biggest markets in poland are biedronka ( portugal ) , lidl and kaufland ( germany ) , tesco ( uk ) , auchan and carrefour ( france ) . 
  one of the biggest exports of poland are parts for german automobiles . 
  and so on , and so on . 
  true . 
  chaebols are strange entities , people do n't realize how much politics and bussiness are intertwined in korea . 
  and before samsung 's fall , we 'd see the biggest bailout in history . 
  oh boy , that would be incredible . 
  nokia did make other electronics ( i had a nokia pc screen , it was really good ) , shame they did n't expand . 
  yeah , because nato will function better if troops from different countries do n't excersise together ... 
  that 's [ butters ] ( https://youtu.be/24zm_jickne?t=32s ) . 
  and they 're mexican-irish . 
  that 's why i like visiting south-east asia . 
  the only expensive thing is a ticket , but if you 're flexible , you can find a ticket for 1500-1800 pln ( especially if you 're okay with flying from berlin , budapest or prague ) . 
  i do n't understand the part about chocolate . 
  if you want 40 % chocolate , you buy 40 % , if you want 60 % , you buy 60 % . 
  there are several big poland-based chocolate manufacturers , so there is huge choice between brands . 
  and it goes for almost every kind of food product - you can buy cheap and shitty , you also can buy a bit pricier ( and still cheaper than anywhere in the eu ) but better products . 
  several things . 
  there were ( somewhat ) functioning states in asia in the time of colonization , most of african states were long gone by that time ( think of great zimbabwe , or timbuctu ) . 
  and most of africa was settled by tribal people ( in case of asia - most of lands were controlled by organized states , even tribal regions were a part of one of those states and had some contacts with them ) . 
  colonization of asia was easy for europeans - they rarely controlled countries they 've conquered directly , most of the times , there was local nobility that was ( more or less ) loyal to the europeans . 
  after decolonization - people of those countries had some common national identity ( or at least there was a movement that led to it ) and common history . 
  well , myanmar is problematic in this case , but i do n't recall any other asian country that had a civil war with ethnic conflict being the main reason ( usually there were ussr/china v. usa proxy wars ) . 
  and africa ... oh boy , what a mess it still is . 
  you have unresolved ethnic and religious conflicts in almost every country there is . 
  borders are completely arbitrary and make no sense - neither geographically , nor ethnically . 
  and a draught . 
  we did lose more blood though ... and that communism thing too . 
  that was n't nice ... 
  your english is fine . 
  and slovakia is cool , i 'm from zakopane , so i ; ve always visited quite often . 
  oravsky podzamok is one of the best and most scenic castles to visit in central europe , mate !, 
  are n't you talking ablout slaves , mate ? 
  that 's where culture comes in . 
  i always wanted to squat , by my mama told me : don not squat , or i 'll spank ya . 
  so i did n't squat at all . 
  that 's the story of my life . 
  yeah , poles were the biggest anti-panslavist griups in the 19th century . 
  we still are . 
  panslavism is a sick idea * * hungary < 3, 
  we 've got lots of `` chinese markets '' , does this mean we got \u4e2d\u56fd\u5316 'd \uff1f edit : wrong hua, 
  yeah , i think that in this part of europe the reason of low approval rates is `` reset '' politics with russia , no nato bases and so on . 
  i think that a lot of people would like to see more pro-active usa in the central-europe/baltics region . 
  source ? 
  well , as / u/le8ip9pu has mentioned , this form is usually insulting . 
  if someone says `` jej m\u0105\u017c jest ... '' you 'll probably think of a positive/neutral trait or his profession . 
  if someone says `` jej m\u0105\u017c to ... '' , you 'll think of an insult ( `` jej m\u0105\u017c to pijak/chuj/z \u0142odziej '' , you can not say `` jej m\u0105\u017c to prawnik '' or `` jej m\u0105\u017c to si\u0142a '' , you 'll say `` jej m\u0105\u017c jest prawnikiem '' or `` jej m\u0105\u017c jest silny '' - you can say `` jej m\u0105\u017c to si\u0142acz '' , but most of the sentences will be negative ) . 
  tl ; dr - op formed his sentences in a way we usually use for insults, 
  [ zakopane ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@49.286746,19.9523698,3a,75y,349.8h,74.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxcu_chy-unpdod2w2ro6eq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ),

  [ st. louis ] ( http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/st-louis-1927.jpg ) = [ warsaw ] ( http://spendyourdays.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/old-warsaw.jpg ) . 
  well , i 'm not a leftist by all means , ideologically i 'm a christian-democrat . 
  and few years ago i was a staunch libertarian ... 
  i am a bit sceptical in case of unions , but i 'm all for redistribution and small-ownership ( think chesterton ) . 
   at its core this is a smug , self-satisfied classist argument , where you have urban , highly educated professionals looking down their noses on the poorer classes . 
  this is one of the reasons why i ( still , despite many decisions which i do n't support ) consider myself a pis voter . 
  i am highly educated , pursuing career in academia , but ( or maybe because of that ) i feel disgusted when i read , or hear those elitist and arogant comments . 
  the divide ( not only in poland ) is not only political , i think it 's cultural . 
  battle between identites . 
  people thinking less of others because of their values , upbringing , education or profession are not a bunch i can identify myself with .
