  there is none , so i have to work for ( those bloody ) foreigners . 
  well , swiss banks are on the top of the list of being involved ( voluntarily ) in money laundering schemes ( e.g. 
  falcon private bank ) . 
  the same goes for france ( e.g. 
  bnp paribas , societe generale ) or the us ( wachovia , mate !, 
  well , they try to cover the difference with immigrants from ukraine . 
  also , they like to hire people with disabilities , because there are some tax incentives for that . 
  everything in this pic screams `` ukraine '' to me ( especially the beer ) . 
  in last census you could choose more than one option for nationality . 
  and there is no question about religion . 
  polish census does n't have a question regarding religion , only regarding ethnicity . 
  i have a polish hound , fantastic breed . 
  and we have a mix of both worlds . 
  but mainly slavic names . 
   hehe huehue i thought people in portugal speak brazilian . 
  strange . 
  you basically work for free and job positions are occupied by people who are both lazy and stupid . 
  fuck that car !, 
  those are n't p\u0105czki , p\u0105czek has to be deep fried in pig lard . 
  rosehip jam is the only type of a p\u0105czek i know . 
  btw , that 's an expensive p\u0105czek . 
  well , this gentleman is an mp . 
  and has a brewery ( damn good one , if you ask moi ) . 
  we played `` berek kucany '' . 
  you would n't say anything or have a safe spot , you would just [ duck and cover ] ( http://allproudamericans.com/paimages/does-duck-and-cover-really-work.jpg ) and hope you wo n't be `` it '' . 
  you may not like pis and current government of poland , but getting the same score as fucking philippines is just asinine . 
  duterte 's government is responsible for thousands of extrajudicial killings ... 
  wot ? 
  it 's classic commie legislation . 
  either way , it does n't matter , it 's just dumb . 
  so you 're either left wing or a devil ? 
  nice . 
  fuck that , evil is evil . 
  putin 's russia is responsible for destroying grozne , war with georgia , annexing crimea and war in donbass . 
  evil is evil , the argument that `` he 's no hitler '' is like saying that shitting on your neighbor 's doormat is okay , because you did n't shit in his livingroom . 
  in new zealand ? 
  yo , but most of those posts are about japanese cartoons , not european comics !, 
  i found na loophole , quick , post [ reksio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejj1b9t93ua ) !, 
  buka !, 
  are you calling zbyszek wodekci a discopolo singer ? 
  shame on you !, 
  it 's considered a classic pop song , everyone knows it . 
  [ po polsku ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7prvskmbbi ) . 
  [ that 's ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iyldx-d1aoc/hqdefault.jpg ) bolek i lolek . 
  dozens of japanese animations will be remembered . 
  tbh i was always making jokes about bydgoszcz , but the city is really nice and chill . 
  can recommend . 
  love it . 
  and it has one of the best [ polish dubbings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uouj0eaxrc0 ) ever . 
  no potato , only sadness, 
  mate , military invasion to grab land is unacceptable !, 
  period !, 
  financial sector sanctions are as strict as those to north korea or syria . 
  i doubt it would change anything in a case like this . 
  it 's obvious you should n't beat anyone to death - that did n't stop those scum . 
  they no longer claim to be communist per se , they belive in juche . 
  lol . 
  there were no air quality control stations back then , but i am sure that the fact that a lot less homes were heated by the mpec and the steelworks was producing an absurd amount of steel resulted in far worse air quality . 
  it 's like saying that people were n't dying of cancer before we diagnosed it for the first time . 
  the fact that a large chunk of cities population was anihilated ( both jews and poles - including a lot of intelligentsia ) , and most of the resources went into building nowa huta have to be taken into the account . 
  so even though the city was spared and there was no siege , the war ( and first years of communism ) affected it immensly . 
  commies hated krak\u00f3 , it was the only place where they did n't manage to rig elections in the 1940s . 
  [ bronx in 1978 ] ( https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8271782725_b826279417_b.jpg ) . 
  with `` america '' in huge letters on top of it . 
  calzonified big mac ? 
  krtek is still hugely popular . 
  you can buy mascots and whatnot . 
  my parents still use swedish cheese slicer my grandma bought in malmo in the eighties . 
  this is indestructible !, 
  soviets were more straightforward . 
  they exported communists to start communist regimes ( like [ rokossovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstantin_rokossovsky ) ) . 
  i 'd like to see a map like that adjusted to the interbellum borders . 
  in poland this conflict is pretty much forgotten , which is weird , considering that the ostfront was on our lands . 
  your english is fine . 
   russia disintegrated in 1917 , end where did that put us ? 
  well , independent . 
  the problem was not turmoil in russia , but consolidation of power and creation of brutal totalitarian state with objective of global domination . 
  jadwiga was a king , not queen . 
  lol , `` bumelanctwo '' is not sedition . 
  it 's being a bum . 
  same with chengdu-lodz . 
  stupidity is not an excuse . 
  `` sannies '' is also an acceptable form . 
  that 's just a symptom of hardships sanescobarians have to endure each day . 
  `` watermarks '' are actually a type of ocular parasite . 
  well , i see that we can definitely import english salt , you have a fuckton of it . 
  and decent rail connections . 
  there is no '' \u0105 '' sound in cyrillic script . 
  also , wtf is \u00c7 ? 
  warschau or krakau - no problem . 
  danzig , breslau , stettin - some people might feel uncomfortable . 
  but as long as you 're not erika steinbach , everything is okay . 
  that 's how most of poland was reconstructed in poland after the war . 
   no , i do n't , italy is wealthier and has better opportunities than poland by wide margin as all statistics suggest . 
  furthermore as western foreigner she might obviously have an upper-hand in employment . 
  dunno man , hsbc in krak\u00f3w is opening 700 new positions this year . 
  and you have a fuckload of financial institutions , it firms , offshore centres located in krak\u00f3w . 
  8hrs jobs , full private healthcare , benefits , national avarage wage . 
  for graduates . 
  that 's not true .
