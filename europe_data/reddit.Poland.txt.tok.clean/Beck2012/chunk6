  when we have a situation , where an allegedly independent body repeats obvious lies of an enemy ( yes , a belligerent state near our borders should be viewed as an enemy , because he threatens our citizens - actually , in malaysian airlines incident , he kills our citizens ; he also threatens our economic interests and the main idea behind the eu - peace in europe ) , people , who made that verdict with ill will , should be punished . 
  we can not make the same mistakes - we have to come clean with this . 
  if we wo n't do so , we 'll fall in the same trap again . 
   so the brits did n't get the ecology portfolio but the finance one , interesting course of event . 
  they were probably interested in this one from the beggining . 
  this , plus tusk as a president of council are probably the biggest successes of uk in last few years . 
  banks in the city are probably thrilled that they got an ally in brussels . 
  employment portfolio is a tricky one - especially with the rumours of ending current rules of employment of workers from other member states . 
  the thing that is really interesting is , if the open job market will be no more , is poland ( and some other countries from 2004 enlargement ) going to be included in the group of countries , which citizens are allowed to work abroad without restrictions . 
  in other words - will it be aimed only at romania , bulgaria , any new member states and , rpobably , croatia . 
  or maybe there will be a old-new north-south divide . 
   and now ** daily flights carry former ukrainian residents to ** the remote russian regions of ** kolyma , sakhalin , kamchatka and various siberian towns ** . 
  ** do those people want to go there ? 
  **  i was shocked by an article published in a magadan newspaper reporting that when the first airplane landed there with 400 ukrainian refugees , journalists rushed forward to ask their questions but were stopped by the ** passengers asking , `` where are we ? 
  '' **  it turned out that when they were put on a plane in the crimean capital of simferopol , ** they were told they were flying to the black sea town of anapa ** . 
  ** and when they landed instead in magadan -- almost 7,000 kilometers to the east ** -- they were told they were only entitled to that one free flight : for all flights out of magadan , they would have to pay full price . 
  what the actual ... is this real ? 
  is there any way to confirm this ? 
  that 's mental !, 
  if it 's true , that 's another step towards cccp-style of treating people , by * de facto * forced relocations . 
  hah , i 've been downvoted heavily writing that russia invaded georgia for last few years on reddit . 
   \u00ef double dot , fancy . 
  is outright lying part of free speech ? 
  / r/china is a subreddit that concentrates on smog and ways to find clean prostitutes .

  maus means worm ? 
  you 'll like how it 's called in polish . 
  and d\u017cd\u017ca is a type of rain ( we have few diffrent words for diffrent kinds of rain ) . 
  you 're viewed neutral . 
  some people emphasize bandera and volhynia massacre , some view you as those , who fight the bad guys atm . 
  i think that opinions on ukrainians are getting better every month ( this data is half year old , even before crimea ) . 
  romania - sorry for that , most people think you 're gypsies . 
  also , many sections of the `` gwoc '' were built by prc from scratch . 
  and they kill babies =  madzia 's mum . 
   silesia makes fun of warsaw . 
  everyone hates warsaw .

  also , mustachioed janusze from podkarpackie are common trend now . 
  looks like well developed european city . 
  it 's not okay . 
  that 's just a natural effect . 
  action -  reaction . 
  russia is responsible for chechen terrorism , that 's all i 've said . 
  i know that people that came to krak\u00f3w from other parts of poland do n't know this word . 
  does your family , by chance , come from east galicia ? 
  it might be popular in lower silesia , considering that lots of your folks come from galizien . 
  something like that , / u/hewman _ robot . 
  :-d more seriously - scholarships !, 
  funding equipment like they ( usa & free europe ) did with polish opposition - printing presses , radio equipment , etc. 
  erm , they did . 
  russia did , have you ever heard about chechen wars ? 
  200 000 casualties . 
  currently , there are less than 1 400 000 people living in chechenya . 
  what is the rationale ? 
  `` the system is wrong and people wo n't get enough money from it '' - that 's true , ofe was n't an efficient system ( too much money was going to funds ) , but that meant , that it should have been repaired , not dismantled . 
  there was a lot of propaganda talk about it - `` ofe gives only xxx pln , that 's ridiculously low ! '', 
  ( while it being a small amount is true , it 's mainly because its share in whole retirement was very low - nationalization changed the amount by few zlotys , not enough to rationalize nationalization itself , and it was the main argument ) . 
  the real reason is the fact , that polish national retirement fund is bankrupt . 
  and shitty , pretty much as every public institution in this country . 
  they needed money fast - mainly to avoid collapse in few years . 
  the second reason is our debt . 
  our constitution includes article , that restricts the size of our debt . 
  current government doubled our debt and we were close to reaching the unconstitutional amount - 60 % of our gdp ( according to some researchers our debt is around 200 % , it depends on the methodology ) , which would mean some kind of polish version of government shutdown . 
  our constitution and fiscal politics after the fall of communism were based on principles of fiscal responsibility - current government changed it drastically ( they were considered fiscal conservatives few years ago ) . 
  one might argue , that it led to limiting the slowdown caused by crisis - and it 's true , we burried every loss with public spending ( we were lucky thatwe got eu structural funds , also euro 2012 has helped a lot ) . 
  but when the money that was possible to spend this way had been already spent , they decided to nationalize retirement funds . 
  and then they admitted that retirements in poland are a joke , and there is nothing they are willing to do about it ( famous tape scandal ) . 
  as for polish budget balance - it 's one time only situation , great influx of money because of nationalization of retirement funds . 
  if not that , the colour would be light red , and it will be in 2015 . 
  ** tl ; dr ** poland has got budget balance surplus because of cheats/console commands . 
  still better than singapore . 
  100 000 sgp dollars for a coe ( permit to drive ) and another 100 000 for a car . 
  let 'em come : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war,

   ** flex ** for angle grinders  ** k\u00e4rcher ** for high-pressure cleaners  ** plexiglas ** for poly ( methyl 2-methylpropenoate ) * same-same * !, 
   ** rigips ** for drywall ** regips **  ** styropor ** for polystyrene foam ** styropian ** ( piana means foam ) . 
   ein ** weck ** glas for mason jars the same in southern poland ( galizien - ex-austria , probably silesia too ) . 
  afaik it 's not used in the north . 
  the problem with chechens is that they were forced to turn into jihadists . 
  seriously , they were pretty peaceful before putin made them public enemies no . 
  1 in russia . 
  there are independence movements in siberia , you have kalmyks , buriats , tuvinians ... 
  the biggest failure of the west in case of russia is not investing in those minorities ( or even regional groups of russians - german speaking people do n't form one nation but several nations ) . 
  in interbellum poland there was a government backed movement ( group of scholars/politicians/activists ) called prometheism . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prometheism they concentrated on nations that currently are independent , but we should use this idea in future . 
  1992 , with exit of soviet troops . 
  also , those lands were grabbed by czechs while we were fighting bolsheviks on the east . 
  they were disputed . 
  although , it 's nothing we should be proud of . 
  the first picture reminded me a joke . 
  * bicycle - device discovered by sgt. 
  gleboc of the russian red army on an attic in poland in 1944 *, 
  they probably got money and wanted to spend it asap . 
   how can it be relevant to the present ? 
  when you see people cherishing cccp , hammer and sickle , not acknowledging all the atrocities - you are pissed . 
  simple as that . 
  that 's like japanese saying that nanjing massacre was just an incident , it 's simply disgraceful and shows no respect to the nation , that has been massacred . 
  edit : especially while participants are alive .
