  heavy on sour cream and lard , a lot of mayo and deep frying . 
  as for this fish soup , i 've usually eaten it pretty lean , but a big dollop of sour cream enhances the tastiness immensely . 
  i like it simple , battered and fried in butter . 
  but yeah , hungarian fish soup with carp ( and lots of paprika ) is one of the best dishes i know . 
  i have no problem with killing a fish and gutting it per se , it 's just easier - the result is the same , so why bother with keeping it alive , if you can buy a freshly gutted carp right on the 23rd of dec. ? 
  yep , the same in poland . 
  you can choose your fish and ask a store 's employee to kill and gut it . 
   - kielbasa \u017bywiecka - just another kind of sausage , not my favourite wut ? 
  it 's a wonderful type of dry , raw sausage . 
  you ca n't cook it , so calling it `` another type of sausage '' is pure nonsense . 
   - \u0106wik\u0142a - just beetroots with horseradish , i prefer plain horseradish cooked beetroots with horseradish . 
  very tasty . 
  damn , mate , have you ever eaten non-polish cuisine ? 
  your `` disclaimers '' do n't explain anything . 
  it does n't look like anything to me . 
  people who ended up there were mainly orphans . 
  new zeland organized a huge transport of polish orphans from india , they did n't swim there by themselves , mate . 
  i know that geography is n't that importnat in the us , but you could at least read the article ... 
  we also have very lax labour law . 
  tyskie is one of many boring polish beers . 
  our mainstream beers are relatively strong ( 5 to 6 % ) and veeery smooth and balance . 
  tbh outside germany , czechia , ukraine and lithuania i do n't like mainstream beers ( i 'm not a fan of belgian beers too - too strong for me ) . 
  there are some amazing polish beers , but most of the times we tend to make _ decent _ beer . 
  9 out of 10 polish beers will be fine , which is a pretty good result . 
  i prefer czech beers - more hops and less alcohol . 
  unemployment rates in warsaw are very low ( 3,2 % ) and the aglomeration is very big , so many people live outside the city . 
  similar with krak\u00f3w , but here we do n't have flats that small ( or at least they are not that popular ) , 28 sq. 
  m. are the smallest i know of , most peole rent something bigger . 
  freakin ' onions commercial ... 
  ca n't wait for a pint of guinesski . 
  der donald is alread `` ruling '' from brussels !, 
   it makes no sense to have it that way in this case well , those are two communities that use different languages and do not share a common culture . 
  it 's easier to share only some institutions than to integrate them . 
   girls usually give a slight hug or not . 
  or a kiss on a cheek . 
  many people itt mention `` serwus '' - in poland it 's very `` old timey '' . 
  you can also say `` czo\u0142em '' or ( to your ~ ~ mates ~ ~ bros from tha ` hood ) `` yo '' . 
  if you grunt `` y '' , while doing it , you basically cover `` dzie\u0144 dobr * y * '', 
  yeah , there were scandals with importing expired meat from sweden in poland few years ago . 
  i guess it 's easier to sell shit by exporting it , than on the producer 's market . 
  i 'm really sorry that a kid died ( allegedly ) because of it , great that croatian health inspectors were able to trace it . 
  ukrainian barszcz is also amazing . 
  better to be tubby than salty . 
  that 's why neoliberals lose one election after another for the last few years all over the west . 
  `` democracy fails us , but we 're democratic . 
  that means anyone who does n't vote for us is undemocratic , authoritarian '' . 
  this kind of attitude is destroying public discourse . 
  also , 78 % in poland ? 
  so who 's `` authoritarian right '' , po or . nowoczesna ? 
  according to polls razem ( anti-establishment left ) , sld ( post-communist , `` caviar '' left ) , . nowoczesna ( neoliberals ) , po ( who knows ... ) add up to ~ 40 % . 
  i understand that according to most media outlets pis and kukiz are populist cannibals , but those mentioned above are not . 
  so , wtf ? 
  and also means `` she drank '' . 
  `` humour '' , you savage . 
  but puppey identifies himself as estonian ... and , if i recall correctly , he said that he does n't feel confident communicating in russian with his teammates . 
  ( although i do n't follow dota2 scene anymore ) . 
  that 's not true . 
  op probably meant yellow , r1a , the indo-aryan haplogroup . 
  it 's really interesting that the biggest concentration of r1a is among sorbs ( polabians in germany ) , poles and ... tajiks . 
  * kto nimio\u0142 kaca * * nie wiy co to smutek * * kie kufa drewniano * * ocka ropom skute * reading classical polish novels might help understanding * gwara g\u00f3ralska * , because the language used as * staropolski * was in fact inspired by gwara . 
  maybe , i 'm not a philologist . 
  you can also call it an investment . 
  most of people have n't heard of \u015awiebodzin before the christ statue , now there are pilgrims coming there to see it . 
  tourism generates money and creates new jobs . 
  sure . 
  and we 're ** winning ** . 
  they were n't dragged , new municipal authorities are really proactive . 
  hope the next mayor of krak\u00f3w will be as proactive as dorula and his team . 
  but the name of the ~ ~ city ~ ~ town comes from `` za kopanymi '' , which means `` over the clearing '' . 
  it helps with stoping seizures . 
  and the fact that vice-minister of justice , jaki , has a son who is suffering from down 's syndrome . 
  i 'm from the southern poland and i 've experienced one earthquake back home . 
  it was n't strong , but wine glasses were shaking . 
  that 's belgian perspective , you do n't share a border with russia, 
  yeah , but people crying themselves to sleep after lagers are still alive , and they are among us ... 
  no , kulturkampf ... 
  we aim at chicago . 
  soup in a can ? 
  wow , i thought they only have those in the uk/us ... 
  i 'd like a cutouts of both donek and jarek , i could pretend there was popis back in 2005 ( * weeps * ) . 
   polish heritage a country which surprise she really hates good for her , it 's part of our citizenship test !, 
  i just puked a lil ' in my mouth . 
  if you do n't want to celebrate our holidays - do n't . 
  but being a dick about it is just sad . 
  let us be happy . 
  and in poland . 
  according to polish national broadcaster , they were the only radiostation to have a live broadcast of the landing in the eastern bloc . 
  you can get from poland to o'hare for 550 usd ... 
  economic left/right : 5.88 social libertarian/authoritarian : 4.51 but it sucks . 
  i 'm really right-winged but some of the questions are plain stupid and have nothing to do with politicla issues . 
  edit : i 'm also : an authoritarian capitalist . 
  0 percent of the test participators are in the same category and 16 percent are more extremist than you . 
  feels good man . 
  http://www.politicaltest.net/test/graphic2/153843_eng.jpg it 's way better than politicalcompass . 
  and i love pinochet , franco and jian jieshi , so it seems that i 'm a rare case of authoritarian capitalist . 
  it 's hard to build a normal , healthy economy when all the politicians were at least socialist . 
  and most of them were , well , crooks . 
  most of the wealthy people have money because of their position in former political system . 
  and a lot of people were corrupted by socialism - their work is inefficient , some of them do n't even want to work . 
  30 years and with new generation of people in power , we 'll catch up .
