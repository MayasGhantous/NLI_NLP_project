  the thing is that kaliningrad is a russian island , surrounded by eu sea . 
  obviously , mindset of its citizens is diffrent than of rest of the nation . 
  kaliningrad is known to have probably the strongest anti-putin sentiment and the most pro-west approach in russia . 
  so what do you think about what 's going on in kyiv ? 
  it 's time to eat some p\u0105czki ... what are your traditions associated with the last thursday before lent ? 
  we shove our mouths with [ those beauties ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1tn83f5.jpg ) ( side note - rose jam filling is the most traditional , not plum jam ) . 
  edit : i ate four p\u0105czki today . 
  delicious stuff . 
  oh god , memories of brno ... 
  water i krak\u00f3 is really hard and tastes bad . 
  there was a time i used to bring tap water from zakopane to krak\u00f3w , but ca n't be arsed to do so anymore . 
  only savages do n't butter their bread ( with an exception of bread + nutella ) . 
  you have to be above 18 y/o to buy booze , shop/pub/whatever has to carry a license ( which is issued by a municipality ) , there are different types of license ( basically , it 's easier to get beer/wine license than hard liquor license , so there are places that sell only low abv stuff - but it varies depending on the municipality , some are stricter than other ) . 
  you should n't drink alcohol in public places , but the definition differs depending on municipality . 
  usually police/stra \u017c miejska will fine you even if there is no law prohibiting you from drinking in a place you 're doing it ( seriously , state law does n't allow drinking just in a handful of places , like streets and city parks , other no-drinking spots have to be idnicated by local regulations ) . 
  you can basically get alcohol 24/7 if you have a liquor store or a filling station nearby . 
  chopin . 
  it 's easier to pay with visa in japan . 
  not so much . 
  it 's illegal on motorways . 
  and france = motorways . 
  not through france . 
  are there any hopes to settle the issue with turks ? 
  okay , i agree that a politician should be an intelligent person with higher education . 
  and it 's not an issue in poland , 92 % of our mps have a diploma , some of them phd . 
  sure , but that 's not ruling . 
   why do n't we use more scientists , programmers , economists ... to run our countries ? 
  maybe because writing a computer program is n't the same as ruling a nation ? 
  in case of economists - i think that it 's a very controversial issue , many of those men were working for large , international corporations ( goldman sachs for example ) and it 's hard to tell who are they loyal to . 
  in my opinion people are corrupt and that 's a fact . 
  political systems should be contructed on this notion and require little to no decision making from administration and politicians ( for example - in poland you must pay a tax for cutting a tree on your land and a municipal office worker might let you to cut it for free , there are no direct rules saying , when you may cut it for free - a general term of `` public safety '' is used , but in my opinion it should be more casuistic ) . 
   could n't you include protestants in that reasoning ( quite a few of them in germany and the netherlands ) ? 
  to be honest , i do n't know . 
  i 've attended a course about catholic social teaching . 
  it 's ideas were one of the most important influences on adenauer , erhard , german odroliberalism and thus wirtschaftswunder . 
  also , you don ; t have to be a catholic , to agree on the ideas of cst . 
  ( and cst starts in the 19th century with rerum novarum , which was highly critical to both socialism and capitalism . ), 
   all in all it seems improbable a single difference explains it all . 
  sure , that 's quite obvious . 
   note also that france was doing better during the previous decade . 
  germany being the `` sick man of europe '' and all that . 
  https://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;hl=pl&amp;dl=pl&amp;idim=country:de:uk:fr:pl:nl:es yep . 
  but reforms that were undertaken by schroeder ( agenda 2010 ) changed that . 
  spd began germany 's retreat from welfare state model , which was then continued by cdu/csu . 
  france did n't do anything like that - even worse , changes made by hollande 's cabinet were populist in their nature and instead of prmoting growth , they did n't change a squat . 
  and look at spain ... germany reformed its economy just before the crisis . 
  if it was n't for schroeder , unemplyment would be probably around 10 % , not 5 % . 
   that said , i am inclined to say that french unions/councils have managed better to defend their workers rights/salaries while the germans have mostly failed to protect worker 's wages . 
  i 'm inclined that french unions managed to exploit the system . 
  look at unemployment rates in france and germany : http://countryeconomy.com/unemployment/france http://countryeconomy.com/unemployment/germany one of the most insightful things about catholic social teaching ( which , to some extent , was a base for germany 's social market economy ) is cooperation between workers and employers , while socialists exist in the paradigm of class conflict , which gives one of the sides means ( and right , or even obligation ) to enforce their demands . 
  which are often hurting both the employer and the economy . 
  you 've mentioned it in a previous paragraph , although i think that emphisising the correlation between structure of relations between employees and employers , and situation of economy , should be more vivid and clear . 
  also , i am not saying , that this is the only reason , why there are two times more unemployed french people than germans . 
  there is a correlation , that 's all . 
  and sorry for off-topic . 
  when you 're in rome , make a trip to assisi , a birthplace of st.francis . 
  this place is magnificent , i am sure , you 'll love it . 
  and it 's max 3 hrs from rome , so you can make it a one-day trip while you 're staying in the capital of italy . 
  also , tuscany is full of wonderful places , shame you 're only for 5 nights in florence . 
  oh , and maranello is a must see , if you 're a fan of cars . 
  ferrari museum is definetely a must-see and it 's quite close to florence , too . 
  sure , especially punctuation . 
  it 's diffrent than polish , so i 'm usually a bit lost . 
   they threaten everyone 's safety . 
  they especially threaten a person that does n't know how to use them . 
  everyone that owns a gun should teach his children how to handle it . 
  if you feel a pole , you are a pole . 
  we love our polonia and consider them polish , even if they do not speak polish . 
  i 'm from zakopane ( ma\u0142opolska , southern poland ) and currently live in krak\u00f3w . 
  so i 'll write about those places , which are most popular tourist destinations in poland .

  come to krak\u00f3w , we have one of four exsisting portraits by da vinci : [ lady with an ermine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lady_with_an_ermine ) . 
  [ rembrandt ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/rembrandt_krajobraz_z_mi%c5%82osiernym_samarytaninem.jpg/800px-rembrandt_krajobraz_z_mi%c5%82osiernym_samarytaninem.jpg ) , [ pieter breughel the younger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:pieter_brueghel_the_younger_preaching.jpg ) , [ mostaert ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/mostaert_portrait_of_a_courtier.jpg/459px-mostaert_portrait_of_a_courtier.jpg ) , [ siemiradzki ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/siemiradski_fackeln.jpg/800px-siemiradski_fackeln.jpg ) , [ che\u0142mo\u0144ski ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/chelmonskijozef.1881.czworka.jpg/380px-chelmonskijozef.1881.czworka.jpg ) , [ matejko ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/prussian_homage.jpg/380px-prussian_homage.jpg ) , [ podkowi\u0144ski ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/podkowinski_-_la_folie.jpg/220px-podkowinski_-_la_folie.jpg ) . 
  national museum , founded in 1879 , owns over 780 000 pieces of exhibition . 
  and there are other , like [ manggha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manggha ) , which exhibits japanese art . 
  * lots of festivals , concerts . 
  * kazimierz - jewish district . 
  lots of synagogues , jewish cementaries , restaurants and other fun places . 
  it 's an area where people like to spend a lot of money on food and booze . 
   it 's far more `` west '' than the rest of eastern europe . 
  because it 's [ central europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) . 
  you 're not considered tall , you are really tall . 
  :-d however , it is relative . 
  in china the only nickname i 've heard from locals was `` big boss '' ( well , i do have bear-like posture ) . 
  in vietnam most people considered me freakishly tall . 
  my korean language teacher also called me very tall . 
  but it 's changing , young koreans also tend to be 1,8 m high . 
  i 'm 1,78 m , i think . 
  and i 'm usually one of the highest people in a tram . 
  90 % of girls are shorter than me and i 'm pretty avarage among guys . 
  so i do n't feel short at all in my country . 
  if someone is higher than me , he 's circa 1,82 m. 
  i do n't know anyone who would be 1,9 m or higher . 
  good bagel is fresh . 
  there are polish bakeries in the uk , so i think that ther might be places to buy some good bagels too . 
  you wo n't get a good bagel from a store , it has to be fresh . 
  like poland . 
  but warmer .
