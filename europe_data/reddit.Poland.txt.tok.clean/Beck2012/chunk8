   they are not saints themselves . 
  okay , what did they do ? 
  they 're being attacked . 
  they 're an european nation with rich history , estabilished self-identification and culture . 
  they 're fuckin ' invaded , mate . 
  people are being killed , for fuck 's sake . 
   get `` revenge '' and start killing russkies and finally get their war ukrainians massacred poles in 1940s . 
  we have as much reasons to hate them as russia - but , apart from waving oun/upa flags , they 've done nothing to deserve any hatred from us whatsoever . 
  russians 've bullied whole region since forever ( as for poland - 18th century would be a start , they 've invaded hungary in 1956 , cz-sk in 1968 , moldova in 1990s etc. ) . 
  ukrainians are a victim . 
  we want to support weaker side . 
   dumb comments from polaks okay , that 's just fuckin ' disgraceful . 
  if you leave , we 'll apply for a statehood . 
  oh , you 're just despicable . 
  because they deserve help . 
  because we ** can ** help . 
  when you see a man in need , you have to help him , if you can . 
  you 're a cunt , if you do n't . 
  go back to school . 
  [ spanish flea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mml2fpec7xu ) . 
  that 's the only melody that makes you happy to wait . 
  sure , i 'm all for it - it 's beneficial for both sides . 
  tbh , i 'd be thrilled , if one day , i could live in lviv , where part of my family comes from . 
  or at least take a plane there and staty for a weekend . 
  ukraine is , unfortunately , a third world country ... 
  also , ukrainians would probably slaughter us a bit . 
  they do n't want anymore `` polish masters '' and i can understand that . 
  but you were . 
  you were part of eec for almost 30 years , before we 've joined and were a big benefactor of eu structural and cohesion funds . 
   also polish army is probably strong enough to hold on their own in conventional conflict for enough time . 
  i 'd say , that russian army is not capable to conduct an operation big enough to be any real threat to poland . 
  they would n't have an air domination ( i think that our closest allies would provide us with air support ) , front would be small , but supply chains very long - also , russia 's got small gdp ( size of italy 's ) , they have to keep most of their forces in other parts of country ... 
  i think that positive aftermath would be possible mainly because of their weaknesses . 
  but his best pal , steinmeier , is mof . 
  and he 's got a brandt syndrome - he thinks that it 's possible to cooperate with russia . 
  well , that 's true , brd can cooperate with russia , but it means that every country in between will be hurt badly . 
  because , while germany might not be against any of us , russia considers us traitors , because we want to be part of western world , where we belong . 
  i 'm hoping for very deep v4 integration , not only military , but also in case of infrastructure , lawa nd bussiness regulation . 
  especially in a situation , when ireland is one of the biggest benefactors of eu . 
  could you post whole article ? 
  paywall . 
  you might be joking atm , but sweden was the main partner of poland in polish vision of ostpolitik . 
  the thing is , sanctions are not working - they are pretty symbolic , middleman in trade relations is de facto accepted . 
  also , putin & co. are not going to cry , if russian students wo n't be able to put some parmeggiano in their pasta . 
  they 'll still drink hennesey and eat salmon .

  highest life expectancy in poland , woo-hoo , suck it , warsaw !, 
  no , it 's not that simple . 
  :-d there are two top positions - marsza\u0142ek ( marshall ) , who is selected by sejmik in each wojew\u00f3dztwo . 
  radni sejmiku ( deputies/members of sejmik ) are elected in direct elections by people of each wojew\u00f3dztwo . 
  but it 's hard to say , that he 's ruling - most of executive is in his hands , sure , but his power is very limited . 
  also , itneresting is fact , that both functions come from military . 
  it 's basically diffrent spelling , is n't it ? 
  the only major diffrence i 've noticed were sufixes to geographical names - oranje and spain . 
  and the `` original '' version of those words are more `` german '' . 
  you eat rotten sharks , where 's culture in that ? 
  no , it 's just a maritime city-state . 
  yeah , i know , but it 's not / u/mrubios fault . 
  / u/mrubios is not deciding on spanish budget , so [ leave your ( ... ) comments in your pocket ] ( http://youtu.be/lfuj4qjgnok?t=13s ) . 
  for my region ( ma\u0142opolskie , especially krak\u00f3w and zakopane ) there is a new important animal , that is being used as replacement for horses for communication . 
  it 's called [ melex ] ( http://discoverunknown.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/turistic_melex_side.jpg ) . 
  ( the guy on the right is apparently going to tame the beast ! ), 
  because welsh shagged 'em all . 
  okay , so are there still people that will claim , that those fuckers are n't terrorists ? 
  both ukrainian and slovak do n't use `` g '' - polish `` sucha g\u00f3ra '' is slovak `` suha hora '' , polish `` bogdan '' is ukrainian `` bohdan '' . 
  and russians have some problem with `` h '' - adolf gitler . 
  i do n't know about `` sounding '' - polish sounds very diffrent than russian . 
  but yeah , i can hear similarities between ukrainian and slovak . 
  it 's not dumb . 
  it 's a subjective matter , one will like it , someone else might not . 
  for us slovak , czech , sorbian and ukrainian - other are a bit tricky . 
  handball is seventh or ninth : http://sport.t4m.pl/inne-sporty/jakimi-sportami-interesuja-sie-polacy http://cohones.mmarocks.pl/topic/mma-szostym-najpopularniejszym-sportem-w-polsce-wedlug-badan . 
  actual list would be : 1 . 
  football . 
  volleyball . 
  ski jumping . 
  pakard 's club snuff was made by gods . 
  best snuff i 've ever tried - and i 've tried a lot . 
  poeschl is probably my favourite brand . 
  make them work for us . 
  every eu citizen that goes should be a target for intelligence . 
  and then , get surveilance , data and geolocalization . 
  easier said than done ... 
  but that 's probably the plan . 
  my flat costed around 200 000 pln ( 50 000 euro ) , 33 sq. 
  meters . 
  plus 2 500 euros ( or 5 000 - rather 5 000 , i 'm not sure ) for a parking spot in underground garage . 
  that 's too much to buy without taking credit - but yeah , no mortage in this case . 
  edit : but most people do n't have that kind of cash , if you earn 1 000 dollars a month , have to pay for current , rented flat , all bills , food etc. , there is not enough money left to afford buying your own place . 
  because it 's better not to have a house , live cramped in a small apartment and not be able to get a credit , because of too low wages ? 
  those are reasons , why there are less mortages in post-communist states , not lack of necessity - lack of opportunity . 
  go to hell . 
  it should give faith , not culture . 
  and spawn great general . 
  wieliczka is a wonder in `` through the ages '' board game !, 
  :-d it 's a civ-like game , really good !, 
  no , this is lose . 
  it basically means , that most people are too poor to have their own place , so they live with family . 
  wow , it was diffrent in poland .
