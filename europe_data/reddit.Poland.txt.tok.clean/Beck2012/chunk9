  buildings were re-privatized , but tenants could not be thrown out . 
  so old landlords got their buildings , but those , who 've lived there , could stay as long , as they wish ( usually it ended with their death ) . 
  so it 's not that big of a problem in poland , and most of old buildings are being modernized , because owners invest in them . 
   the communist regime made of point of providing everyone with a home ( even if it was a small shitty apartment ) . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how this worked , someone can shed more light . 
  it was made possible by several procedures - i 'm sure , that it was diffrent in various countries , and depending on the times ( in 1950s communist law was fucking atrocious , trying to limit ownership of anything to minimum - which proved to be ineffective ) . 
  in 50s situation after the war was absolutly shitty - there were hardly any new apartment buildings ( with mdm and nowa huta as exceptions ) . 
  old buildings were being repaired and every shortage of hosues was n't a big problem for our new occupants . 
  they just took houses from their rightful owners and put homeless in them . 
  it would do in a short-term , but many families still live in `` kwaterunek '' - and this is 3rd , 4th generation , living in somone elses house , often in very bad conditions - because if it 's not theirs , they wo n't invest in it . 
  two years ago i 've been on internship in court and stumbled upon a document in which a woman was described , who did n't have toilet in her house , because she would n't invest a dime in it - it was n't hers , although she was living in it for 50 years . 
  this problem will be resolving in time - with older people dying , and younger moving out from their old houses ( which are n't theirs actually ! ) . 
  but rightful owners are the biggest losers - they get often devastated houses , after many years of nearly no income from the tenants . 
  but the most impact was from housing cooperatives - most apartments in those times were builed as a cooperative , but if you did n't have dollars to give a bribe , you would have to wait even a dozen years . 
  and , again , it was n't yours . 
  fortunately , for last few years , it 's possible to buy back a house for low price from a cooperative . 
  i doubt anyone would bother with `` legal requirements '' . 
  yeah , i 've written in edit , that i 've been commenting on other photo , that i did n't include . 
  all i know is s\u00f6rbar . 
  i 'll manage . 
  mmm , splendid !, 
  custard sauce and cranberry jam with a cream-turd reduction !, 
  breakfest : [ first one ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bt26obnccaafonh.jpg ) [ second ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bbsejgtcyaaxh7a.jpg ) [ third ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bvqxhykcyaamjr7.png ) third one is interesting , it shows food in public hospital and private one . 
  lefy photo was submitted yesterday by someone on twitter , and one other guy ( who 's a pro-government `` journalist '' ) said that 's perfectly normal and he treats himself with food just like that . 
  when i 've seen that , i just wanted to puke - sure , eating bread wth a bit of butter and tomato for a breakfest is cool , but not a fifth of a tomato and three pieces of cheapest bread , that 's a torture and does n't have any nutrtitional values . 
  edit : sorry , i was describing other photo , but you get the idea , aye ? 
  all photos are from twitter . 
  the only desert in europe ( i think ) . 
  chick 's summer is definetely wrong , you do n't call a lady `` baba '' , you call her `` babka '' . 
  also , `` baba '' means woman , `` babka '' or `` babcia '' means grandma . 
  and yeah , there is no word for sunshower ( or `` devil is beating his wife '' :-) ) . 
  my addition : ** juma\u0107 ** - to steal . 
  fascinating story - there is this old western called `` 3:15 to yuma '' or something like that . 
  and a train , that was going to germany , which was used by gangsters going there to steal cars , was at 3:15 pm . 
  so they were going to yuma . 
  :-d ** cygani\u0107 ** - to lie . 
  literally , `` to gypsy '' ( cygan = gypsy ) . 
  in polish baba means both grandma and woman ( grandma would be babka , but baba means woman , common term `` baba z jajami '' ) . 
  it 's hard not to remember , sine the only other thing that happens there is translating old documents . 
  that you 're the guy that had a crush on polish girl and posted about it daily on / r/poland . 
  is it that much a deal ? 
  just buy locally produced food ( or just produced in eu , because standards and quality are pretty the same ) , that 's simple and should be promoted . 
  but rallying against ttip ... imo it 's one of the biggest achievements of trans-atlantic relations since marshall plan . 
  that 's not that long , mate . 
  [ n700 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n700_series_shinkansen ) reaches 270 kmph in 3 minutes . 
  so , make it 1 hour for that distance . 
  i 've been in a hst in china and acceleration is incredible - you hardly feel anything , yet the train is accelerating very quickly . 
  all right , good job putting it on a map . 
  still , i 'm just angry looking on such sloppy job , putting this kind of proposition on paper . 
  still idiotic . 
  anyway , what 's the source of data or anything to support such unreal location of railways ? 
  the only high-speed connection in poland is omitted - it 's direct connection between warsaw and krak\u00f3w . 
  instead , for some reason , you put it through lublin . 
  second , traditionally , vienna was the central rail hub in central europe , so why does this line from poland turn just before it reaches bratislava and goes to budapest ? 
  but that 's not a cargo network . 
  it 's in almost the same spot , as wien . 
  sure , but bratislava and wien are closer and more important , so there should be main hub . 
  the diffrence is , beijing-shanghai line is quite expensive . 
  but yeah , traveling at steady 305 kmph is fun , especially when you take one that stops only once ( or is it twice ? ) . 
  there should be more express lines with few stops . 
  also , i would love to be able to get from krak\u00f3w to pozna\u0144 in reasonable time and without transfers . 
  now , there are no direct train , or even plane connections ( which annoys me the most ) . 
  krak\u00f3w-bratislava-vienna , why every connection should be through budapest ? 
  and adding lublin between warsaw and krak\u00f3w is idiotic and wo n't happen in milion years - lublin is far away and pretty insignificant . 
  put it on map , to see how stupid it is . 
  how are multiple photos of military convoys done by a man in a military uniform with geolocalization in russia or ukraine a prank ? 
  no , it does n't . 
  their power bases solely on strategic weapons and spec-ops . 
  regular units are equipped in outdated weapons and pretty demoralised . 
  ( i do n't know any other military , which special operations were uncovered by its own soldiers putting pictures on instagram ) . 
   iraq , afghanistan , pakistan , yemen , oman , syria , libya , lebanon , israel , palestine , vietnam , cambodia , cuba , grenada which are all us states , just like crimea is part of russia now . 
  russia 's not a great power , their gdp is similar to italian ...

  because stars are pretty . 
  i did n't encounter photos with geo-location . 
  but i trust anders fogh rasmussen , when he says , that russian military vehicles have entered ukraine . 
  he 's leading nato , which is n't an anti-russian club , many member states are visibly pro-russian in this whole mess ( hungary , italy , spain and to some extent germany ) , so i doubt he 's outward lying . 
  also , bbc is , in my opinion , a reliable source . 
  generally beer in poland is good - even budget beers like harna\u015b or kasztelan are okay ( and you can have five pints for 2,5 euro ) . 
  not to mention local breweries and microbreweries - nice , cold ipa from pinta is what i call a good evening . 
   kasztelan it 's a budget beer made by carlsberg , i think .

  there were rumors of many secret burials in russia - and do n't forget about strelkov , who is a russian officer and terrorist commander . 
  yeah , sorry i did n't write , that it 's in polish . 
  most of western journalists are checking ( nearly ) empty trucks , while russians are carrying out a ~ ~ covert ~ ~ * unofficial * operation , smuggling arms to terrorists -  https://twitter.com/tkulakowski/status/500193320141062144 https://twitter.com/bbcstever/status/500220230912987137 https://twitter.com/djp3tros/status/500233986292338688, 
   got to check out more convoy trucks this morning . 
  a lot of them mostly empty like this one do n't cherry-pick . 
  according to [ this guy ] ( https://twitter.com/tkulakowski ) journalists could check every truck they 've wanted . 
  according to journatlists - every truck they 've searched was almost empty . 
   the trucks will be loaded with injured civilians , asylum seekers and combatants wearing plain-clothes and driven to russia . 
  have you ever drove a russian military transporter ? 
  live person in the back would probably die because of injuries after a short stroll ...  putin is a grand-wizard who made military equipment appear on the trucks ( with none of the present reporters noticing it ) and then made the equipment disappear while the trucks were mobile on the roads ( again , with nobody seeing this ) . 
  presumably a separatist somewhere in donetsk is now pulling an assault rifle from behind his ear while amazed onlookers clap . 
  they hade whole two days to hide anything they were transporting ... 
  the nearest lidl to my parent 's place ( where i 'm staying for summer ) is in slovakia . 
  i 've been there week ago , i was surprised how small was the alcohol section ( but i 've bought myself few zlate bazanty and tokaj furmint for almost half the price i 'd have to pay in poland ) . 
  in krak\u00f3w i have lidl very close to my apartment , two tram stops , so i shop there quite often .
