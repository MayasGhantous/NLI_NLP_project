we 're not even part of the former ussr . 
  why would putin give a shit about some second-tier country in europe , and at such high risk ? 
  he may play around with some little shitholes , since no one 's gon na stand up for them , but messing with big eu and nato members for no pay-off whatsoever would be asinine . 
  i do n't think it 's very common in europe . 
  it seems people usually just take their books with them in their backpacks . 
  hahahahahahahahahahaha * no * the backpacks can be pretty heavy , but not back-breakingly . 
  but teachers are fireable . 
  he 's a laughing stock to everyone in the world . 
  lol nope . 
  you 're more like a gang that 's good to be on good terms with and is a far , far better option that another gang . 
  and even if someone has a good or neutral opinion of you , which is n't all that rare , no one believes in some noble mission of america . 
  he is lunatic and must be stopped , but nobody cares , and he probably does n't give a shit about destroying the us if you do n't want to take power away from him . 
  negotiating with him is pointless . 
  it 's illegal in poland . 
  nice place to live ? 
  depends . 
  some people think more gdp means better life , others think you 're decades behind europe . 
  got your shit together ? 
  nope . 
  worth looking up to ? 
  in some aspects only , otherwise no . 
  lots of religious nutjobs , materialism , stupidity , fast foods , pop culture , ultra-patriotism . 
  no one cares . 
  there are n't that many conspiracy theorists outside of the us , and no one 's really interested other than them and scientists , though it 's pretty obvious that the earth can not be the only place with life . 
  sadly not . 
  i 'm saying this because our plag is shit . 
  had to delete my comment because i thought you were asking about non-anglophone channels . 
  me ca n't into literacy .

  poland of us greatest ally !, 
  most important !, 
  russia conquer poland be evil , poland capture moscow be glorious - poland stronk !, 
  pizza and khachapuri are among my favourites , definetely . 
  there 's a town and a castle called scrotum . 
  i guess ukraine was kind of a colony ... `` lw\u00f3w jest polski !, 
  people either like them or hate them . 
  wait ... do you ... do you ... do you also always take margharitta ? 
  i 'm not alone ? 
  * the limits of my language mean the limits of my world * - ludwig wittgenstein, 
  that 's a weird thing to take note of . 
  pozna\u0144 , the capital of greater poland in the central-west . 
  wroc\u0142aw , the capital of lower silesia in the southwest . 
  and the `` tricity '' , that is gdynia , sopot and gda\u0144sk at the baltic coast . 
  i 've heard than olsztyn in the northeast is also pretty good , though everything around it is a shithole . 
  anything that lies near the eastern borders and is n't a big city is fairly poor . 
  for example , olsztyn has a 7 % unemployment rate , average in poland , while everything north of it , near the russian border , has a ~ 25 % unemployment rate . 
  oh yeah , the '' \u017bmudzini '' butthurt ... we have that too , and some even call them '' \u017bmudziny '' , as if they were things or animals . 
  such a distinction in plural does n't exist in russian or belarusian , i think . 
  mieszko i is generally called `` the first ruler of poland '' , even though there was no such thing at the time . 
  he was just a 10th century tribal king who conquered other tribes and accepted christianity for political reasons , and the entity that was later inherited and reunited by his descendants became poland in , i guess , the 14th century when the state was separated from the monarch . 
  it 's often stupidly underlined that he was a ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119 , not a kr\u00f3l even though ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119 meant king ( these words are cognates ) , and it is contrasted with his son who adopted charles the great 's name ( karol/karl - kr\u00f3l ) as his title when he was officially crowned as a christian king by the pope . 
  edit : there are also some of his ancestors , but little is known about them other than names , afaik . 
  [ first hussars - polan stronk !! 1 !, 
  there are many of `` patryjo\u0107i '' who call lithuanians `` lietuvisy '' and lithuanian poles `` litwini '' . 
  some people still hold that vilnius or lviv are polish cities , and that western ukraine , lithuania and belarus belong to us , and also that the polish people in lithuania are the true lithuanians , while lithuanians are just \u017bmudzins . 
  no one in actual politics gives a shit , thankfully . 
  `` wina tuska '' is a popular meme , a known poet even wrote a poem about it . 
  it means `` tusk 's fault '' , and it was constantly used by the opposition when donald tusk was in power . 
  the height of jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski and the ladder he stands on during manifestations are often laughed at . 
  president andrzej duda is often called mr. pencil , the pencil that became the president because , until recently , he would pretty much never veto a bill passed by other cronies of kaczy\u0144ski . 
  he is also often called `` adrian '' , because in the satirical show `` ucho prezesa '' , no one remembers his true name and everyone calls him adrian . 
  the was a manifestation recently under his vacation villa , where people were chanting `` adrianie , zosta\u0144 andrzejem ! '', 
  urging him to veto the new bills . 
  calling people agents of the communist police ( ubecy , esbecy ) has become a meme , because pis politicians have called young protesters `` bolshevik ghouls '' and `` sb widows '' . 
  `` the worse sort of poles '' and `` the scoundrels '' are also popular , due to their use by the ruling party . 
  there was a satirical post on a polish forum recently that started like this `` i was born in 1987 . 
  i joined the communist police in 1988 . 
  i served until 1989 '' . 
  the current government claims legitimacy from `` the nation '' or `` the sovereign '' , so their opponents have started calling the uneducated , rural masses as such . 
  the government is also known for whataboutism , that is changing the subject to what the previous government , po , did or did n't , spawning the `` ale za pe\u0142o ... '' meme . 
  ( but when po ... ), 
  szko\u0142a zawodowa ( occupation school ) is mainly aimed at the worst students , though there are some smart people who go to them to become hairstylists or tailors . 
  you ca n't even go to university after graduating from a school like this . 
  technikum has bigger standards , but still very low , academically-wise , though one can attend university after graduating from a technikum . 
  it 's aimed at people who are interested in non-academic , practical stuff and getting a job in things like it , gastronomics , etc. , right after high school . 
  liceum has the highest academic standards and is aimed at those wanting to go to university . 
  that includes those interested in arts and humanities , but also those with interest in sciences . 
  if a person is really good in sciences , it would be considered a waste of talent to not go to a technikum . 
  grades range from 1 to 6 , they affect the average score , which is the base for final grades , which are given for the first semester and the entire year . 
  there are no semester or annual big exams . 
  these only conclude each level of education - egzamin sz\u00f3stoklasisty from math and polish concludes the elementary , egzamin gimnazjalny from polish , math , history , science and language concludes the gymnasium and matura concludes technikum and liceum . 
  the first two are the biggest factors in further education , while matura is the only factor when applying for university . 
  you do n't pick individual subjects . 
  instead , students are organized into classes , each grade having multiple ones - 1a , 1b , etc. , 2a , 2b . 
  etc. , etc. 
  in podstaw\u00f3wkas and gimnazjums is mostly organization , but it matters in high school . 
  zawod\u00f3wskas and technikums have different classes depending on the job you want a license for . 
  liceum class profiles mean that you get 3-4 enhanced subjects , meaning more classes per week and more material , while other subjects have less classes/week and are often compressed to one subject . 
  also , some schools get creative with unique classes , typically one per week . 
  liceums typically have general , biol-chem ( biology , chemistry , nature sciences ) , mat-fiz ( mathematics , physics , it ) , humanistic ( a generic polish , history , society profile ) profiles , but the better ones get more creative .
