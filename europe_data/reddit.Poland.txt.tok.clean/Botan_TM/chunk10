  what a fact , that poles generally oppose one supremacist intolerant religion , have to do with all other religions ? 
  also vandalism of mosques happens in west too , same as attack on jews ( but those may be made by believers of religion of peace ) . 
  i will be a devil 's advocate here . 
  world change , everything change within time . 
  so if some place become pricey , is they a point in trying a stall a change , or maybe it is just better to accept it and move elsewhere ? 
  more tourists for eastern poland ? 
  check bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest instead , until you can before we cut down 1/3 of it \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
   freedom of religion . 
  non of these exist in countries like hungary or poland . 
  you what mate ? 
  no freedom of religion ? 
  poland had freedom of religion when western europeans were murdering each other over if they can translate bible . 
  i have some funny anecdote , when i was on famous , especially in poland [ lychakiv cemetery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lychakiv_cemetery ) , located in lviv , ukraine , with spanish colleague , i noticed and showed him a grave of polish soldier , who according to description , was a veteran from [ battle of somosierra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_somosierra ) . 
  [ japanese brazilians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_brazilians ), 
  i think i notice a pattern . 
  countries , which had close colonies ( such as belgian congo do not count ) , and were on verge on europe , when asked about culturally close countries pick up former colonies . 
  from the other hand , countries in central europe did not have colonies , but a enormous experience with living with different nationalities in one country , so idea of having sort of `` ladder of identities , different on different levels '' is n't a new thing . 
  for example austria-hungary , polish-lithuanian commonwealth , yugoslavia , german and russian empire . 
  uk or spain too . 
  portugal do not have such experience . 
  i would rather say , that bad things happens , when some intellectuals , or pseudo-intellectual charlatans , believe so strongly that their rationality makes them incapable to make mistake , that they become arrogant and think they have right to use whatever means they can . 
  then , bad things happens . 
  in the other words , taking that other perspective , i would put this that way . 
  nationality is not your personal achievement to be pride of , but a debt and duty , which obligate to at least perform as well as previous generation ( by just not being a dick for example ) . 
  so just having nationality is not worth to be pride of , but fact of having such high raised bar on you and living up to it is something worth it . 
   not op , but gay people were prosecuted because of their sexuality until not so long ago , in fact , they are still prosecuted in many places and so many nations in europe . 
  i 'm in poland and it is also blocked . 
  so it is not only your law , probably uploader blocked it or something . 
   iar 330 googles it , found [ that youtube video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrs50zq_sds ) , i approve . 
  netherlands looks like abscess going to explode because of pus . 
  i could post local polish newspapers , will any of them be any good ? 
  please give source ? 
  sorry , poe 's law . 
  that 's the best summary so far . 
  are you retarded ? 
  please stop reposting this fake news , later investigation proved nothing happened , even `` victim '' admited it not happened . 
  sort of russian court jester ? 
  they were stealing our jobs then . 
  lol xd, 
  this name was n't used as a geographic term , that 's why your example is just typical straw man . 
  it 's like `` i identity as vegetarian because my parents were vegetarians and i eat meat everyday , is n't that obvious ? '', 
  yup , episode with opposition leader visiting him and arguing was brilliant . 
  [ there is a link to first episode of `` ucho prezesa '' ( `` the chairmans 's ear '' ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyiaathvvyi ) , show have english subtitles , but you have to turn them on . 
   greater germania it was n't even a thing ... 
  going by your way of thinking , geography names should be the ones being constantly changed to please nationalists . 
   it 's not like they need a collective name anyway . 
  if they is no need to use it , then name will ceased to be used . 
  if so , why irish are so triggered by this ? 
  but nationalists are the ones who seems to be easily triggered by those and want change them to make them match their vision of world , instead living on and concentrate on future . 
  lol , and those are just made-up names and longer names . 
  but then isle of man also need recognition , so what about british & irish & man & scottish isles , lol . 
  name british isles is short and after the biggest island among thousands of islands there , so i do n't see a reason to change it for political reasons . 
  and i call it triggering because it is one . 
  so what is non triggering name other than that for all those islands above france ? 
  thanks nationalists for downvoting for legit question . 
  [ polish one is based on gif ] ( https://i.redd.it/52mgt2wlxfaz.gif ), 
  may i ask , how judges are appointed in singapore ? 
  i have heard you are ruled by one party for long time . 
   learn history first and remember iran was in under british political influnce then . 
  not exactly . 
  it was under direct british and soviet occupation after anglo-soviet invasion of iran in 1941 . 
  i doubt it . 
  but how is that even possible ? 
  even most radical and extreme republicans are leftists by korwin-mikke standarts . 
  that 's something more interesting to see than just a sunshine , but i may be weird though . 
  we use , we have them printed on moneys . 
  i agree with cars . 
  it 's the same in even smaller things . 
  that 's why i love my crazy country , everything is possible here . 
  you mean in rightful polish clay !? 
  / s anyway all the best the other kind of galician . 
  i hope we get those before operation british fully starts in a one and half year  / inside gundam joke /, 
  so not very different from f-35 ? 
  i think japan can be trusted with that part . 
  who does n't ? 
  for some reason i think about french-german fighter . 
  japan have some experience and now they are building their own after usa declined selling them a f-22 : [ mitsubishi x-2 shinshin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitsubishi_x-2_shinshin ) . 
  not true , third bill will be signed . 
   except that , the only ones we are under attack from is the far right . 
  if you count islam as a totalitarian far right ideology ... 
  [ common sense is not that common apparently ] ( https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20161105_mac127.png ) , for example if one group have a fertility bigger by 50 % , then every in every generation group participation will rise by 50 % . 
  usa lied a world about wmd 's including poland , we sent with symbolic 200 soldiers , which is something like 0,1 % of invasion army . 
  but it is really funny to see how some people are desperately catching any possible thing in order to pin a responsibility for failure of muslim world and migrants on us . 
  yup americans asked us for permission to attack iraq , we could tell them to not doing it and they would listen us . 
  it 's like lumping slovakia as a country responsible for starting a wwii . 
  around 15 % voted for parties , which by a slight margins did not make it through threshold . 
  instead posting `` funny '' statements , learn something : [ lebanon census and sensibility ] ( https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21709535-new-data-reveal-looming-crisis-lebanons-ruling-elite-exposing-fiction ) downvotes instead providing substantial response , is somebody brigading a sub today ? 
  and christians are dying off being replaced by muslims . 
  it is true , in one paragraph these is written about 3 candidates , in other about 5 . 
  check population change in lebanon . 
  that sentence  polish people got the first in the country 's history child benefit is a pure bullshit , because po gave people child benefits by giving tax returns for having kids . 
  hard to say , google for example `` ulga prorodzinna '' , or even a symbolic `` becikowe '' which was made by ... pis first government something like 10 years ago . 
  and we are changing it to even more oppressive , what a fricking wonderful idea . 
  pis now is clearly saying autumn will be a time to rework laws regarding television and media , i guess this is awesome ? 
  also , if po made so many obvious crimes , then why after two years of ruling ziobra , a failure in his law profession , did not managed to put in arrest anybody ? 
   polish people got the first in the country 's history child benefit hahahahahaha that pislamists propaganda is getting more ridiculous every day . 
  and because previous governments screw up some things , this means pis can do whatever they please and crew up even more ? 
  it think word `` corruption '' and polish `` korupcja '' have a bit different meaning , in polish it is a equivalent of `` bribery '' , but in english it also means something like polish `` zepsucie '' . 
  they will say that trump was fooled by polish ( and repeating after them ) leftist journalists , who are spreading lies and defecating on their own nest . 
  in response they will send a letter with a truth explaining that all is ok , and all of that just post-commies and thieves hysteria .
