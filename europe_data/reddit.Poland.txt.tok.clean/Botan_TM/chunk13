  and i doubt there are syrians in italy ... 
  personally , i think , now this is a bit of posturing for internal reasons . 
  i mean , if he really wants reforms in france , he will met a big resistance . 
  so before doing them , he wants to show off how tough he is defending french workers from ee competition and not easily giving cash to ee . 
  tl , dr : he wants to make reforms in france and make ee pay for it a bit . 
  so you actually value a hypocrisy , than a straightforward response . 
  quite worrying . 
  no , this is absolutely in point . 
  you are trying to pin a responsibility for world superpower acts to country from third league . 
  saddam would be removed anyway , and polish involvement in removing him was symbolical , basically meaningless . 
  and by sending army after invasion was done , poland already helped to stabilise this mess . 
  about currently blowing up syria , poland have something like 4 f-16 flying reconnaissance missions , so your accusation is rather laughable . 
   slovakia took in 10 more refugees than the czech . 
  the small symbolic gesture won out on giant pissing contests here . 
  so basically , just some meaningless show and making a hypocritical facade , without solving anything is just good enough to be a nice eu members , but better do not try say `` emperor has no clothes '' when pointing at pc-related pure emotional stuff ? 
  what kind of european values is that ? 
  polish pis is messing with polish judicial system , but instead doing something with that , eu waste time on pushing not working solution for migrant crisis and give extra point to pis ratings . 
  what the hell is going on ? 
  you mean poland is so important , that without our consent usa would not made a mess there ? 
  holly crap , what are you smoking ? 
  can these days anything be more commercial than christmas ? 
  poland have the biggest one though : [ meanwhile in rzeszow , poland ... the biggest pussy monument in the world ] ( https://9gag.com/gag/am1be31/meanwhile-in-rzeszow-polandthe-biggest-pussy-monument-in-the-world ), 
  in poland everything is upside down , so it makes sense . 
  i confirm that . 
  but they believe they should bother others , sherlock . 
  i 'm constantly impressed how pictures used by journalists completely do not match article . 
  ok so gibe opposite example . 
  korwin was n't a minister , but just a mep . 
  you mean `` human trash '' video ? 
  usually commies were about armed police and disarmed people though . 
  exactly , english was already in use , and irish try keep their language alive so i guess i though , why not . 
  i 'm not a french though . 
  which decided to choose their native languages , not english , as their official eu ones . 
  your point is invalid . 
  not only yours . 
  anyway , seems it was a very long day , a year long , 
  almost like [ this ( youtube link ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mur-c5iiwji ), 
  that was savage . 
   amor patriae nostra nope , there is picture [ link - ( krasi\u0144ski library ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/okolnik_9.jpg ), 
   nihil sine deo in our case it is rather [ nihil novi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nihil_novi ) ... 
  in poland we have a variant of it called `` kto rosomak ( wolwerine ) '' and it 's pretty good . 
  apparently in afghanistan talibans called it `` green devil '' . 
  i know that , lol . 
  they think the same i guess . 
  summer of 1812 best summer ever . 
  shhh ... our state owned military companies with party colleges as chairmans have to show something sometimes with a lot promises ... 
   the average german has his head so high up his arse that he does n't give a shit what other countries think about him . 
  in this context i 'm not sure if i should be happy or be sad about . 
  nope . 
  japanese kinda tried in 1939 and lost - [ battles of khalkhin gol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battles_of_khalkhin_gol ) . 
  japanese army was already heavily involved in china , they simply could n't start a war against ussr . 
  i bet he speaks 3 different languages : american english , british english and even australian english , who knows , maybe even more . 
  haha brilliant response . 
  and then some people from west europe wonder why ee prefers us military than common eu military . 
  i you can imagine , than it is not , that i 'm impressed how capable your imagination is . 
  it is not sarcasm . 
  you have a point there , humans brain simply works in that way , that seeing single tragedy affect it more and deeper , than reading about thousands . 
  invasion of black nazi gay 1/32 native american raping trigger happy car crashing seal murdering jews ? 
  have i missed something ?

  how big it would be in comparison with artificial [ lake solina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_solina ) ? 
   poe 's law i have n't known there is a law about it , thanks !, 
  shall i add / s , because shrug meme was n't enough to convoy a joke ? 
  well , when you are driving 60 km/h seatbelts helps , but with more than 120 km/h , having no seatbelts and flying through window may be your only chance to survive \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  to be honest , sometimes i 'm a bit annoyed by seeing some vip visiting places of tragedies . 
  is not their job to make victims feel better and spend time with them , they should spend every possible time doing a job , which would prevent such tragedies or minimalize effects . 
  i do n't say authorities should not do it at all , but sometimes it looks like a race to be there first or show as much empathy as possible , just to gain political points . 
  i 'm posting a relevant video with a text from `` golem xiv '' book by lem . 
  i could n't put it better . 
  so a bit like polish pis and marcinkiewicz ( pm during first pis goverment ) . 
  i would die ... my condolences . 
  can you translate this to some civilized units ? 
   which , in fact would be absurd , since if two sets of laws could potentially apply to the person due to their religious background , the one they obviously chose to apply should apply . 
  in first polish republic it worked as that : poles had their own laws and judicial system , jews had their own , etc. 
  but if members of different communities had an argue , there were judged in accordance to polish law . 
  there were nobles changing religion so they could marry again xd . 
   the point of my post is really that the phrase ` sharia law ' is used ubiquitously but is really under-defined . 
  not really in this case . 
  actually inheritance is very precisely described in quran in surah 4 , for example verse 11-12 :  allah instructs you concerning your children : for the male , what is equal to the share of two females . 
  but if there are [ only ] daughters , two or more , for them is two thirds of one 's estate . 
  and if there is only one , for her is half . 
  and for one 's parents , to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children . 
  but if he had no children and the parents [ alone ] inherit from him , then for his mother is one third . 
  and if he had brothers [ or sisters ] , for his mother is a sixth , after any bequest he [ may have ] made or debt . 
  your parents or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit . 
  [ these shares are ] an obligation [ imposed ] by allah . 
  indeed , allah is ever knowing and wise . 
   and for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child . 
  but if they have a child , for you is one fourth of what they leave , after any bequest they [ may have ] made or debt . 
  and for the wives is one fourth if you leave no child . 
  but if you leave a child , then for them is an eighth of what you leave , after any bequest you [ may have ] made or debt . 
  and if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister , then for each one of them is a sixth . 
  but if they are more than two , they share a third , after any bequest which was made or debt , as long as there is no detriment [ caused ] . 
  [ this is ] an ordinance from allah , and allah is knowing and forbearing . 
  anyway , point of my post was to avoid potential mistake , this is not a case of introducing sharia , which many people fear , this is a case of some old leftover from the past . 
   i do n't see how this makes it better . 
  i 'm not a fan of muslims , but still i do not like to spread manipulated fears . 
  i assumed many people would jump on sharia being introduced in europe ( like uk courts ) , but there is nothing about introducing something new , in this case we have a leftover from old times , when indeed it was normal to having different communities with their own laws . 
  so instead `` sandpeople conquers europe '' this rather falls under `` somebody digs up some old funny law from the past '' , like for example law prohibiting insulting foreign head of state in germany . 
  edit : i simply hate clickbaits .
