  vat is a turnover tax ? 
  looks my english names of different taxes need some polishing . 
  i was thinking about tax , a very small percentage , paid from all revenue , not just from profit . 
  thanks for info about ccctb . 
  it does n't matter . 
  it 's simple , just put a franchise central in tax heaven , and charge national branches with fees so big , that they wo n't shown profits and so not pay taxes from those in other countries . 
  turnover tax for international business could help with that , but this kind of tax is not allowed in eu . 
  for comparison , how `` lektor '' ( voice-over ) works , check and compare those for unique polish 90 's alike experience : [ kung fury - hd - lektor pl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixx25s2ip4 ) [ kung fury official movie [ hd ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs5p_laqivg ) i had no idea voice-over is barely used outside poland . 
  so why recruitment have already started , even people i know got invitation letters ( with `` cursed soldiers '' mentioned in first paragraph , lol ) from wku in rzesz\u00f3w ? 
  pis set a new standard with firing people , they fired freaking everybody , and what is worse , they replaced them with complete ignorants . 
  pis literally destroyed civil service . 
  `` according to a proposition of act , commander of territorial defence army is one of three main commanders , territorial defence army , in contrast to other branches of armed forces , are not under commander-in-chief command '' no wonder people are joking it 's a reincarnation of ormo or zomo . 
  they have wasted monies on creating ak-armed poorly equipped arm of defence under direct macierewicz rule to fight russian armoured units !, 
  current czech president , milo\u0161 zeman is a bit controversial person . 
  do you mean having a president - meme generator ? 
  looks like this is trend now . 
  it 's funny coincidence ( or maybe not , some remains of polish-lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  ) , the same name is used in polish , `` czechy '' . 
  i have met roumania too in some a bit old books about wwii . 
  it was hard to ban it , after all then we had three other countries at once ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i swear this map appears on a regular basis here . 
  4 years in the worst case ... 
  exactly . 
  also first time pis had a government with two other parties and still it was not enough to have a majority in parliament . 
  people were saying about kaczy\u0144ski and pis for almost decade , or about brexit or whatever . 
  actually these days hearing phrase  never get elected . 
  make me fell nervous or excited in a bad way . 
  i disagree . 
  it is considered to accept a restriction of freedom , if that 's collide with others ' people freedom . 
  so insulting a somebody `` touch somebody '' personally . 
  discussing about historic facts do not , historic facts are not a person with rights . 
  i honestly completely do not understand what is this fuss about . 
  let 's assume god created everything 10000 years ago , but with all past history ( skeletons of dinosaurs and everything else ) . 
  then it ca n't be proved wrong or right , but also change absolutely nothing for science from creationist point of view , because if god created those skeletons of dinosaurs and our minds , then i guess he wanted us to freaking dig for them and use our minds to think about damn skeletons . 
  so both creationists and normal people should use their brain to explore the world . 
  so what 's the fuss about ? 
  are those so dumb creationist they really thinks evidences for evolution are just scam or their opinion of god is so low , they thinks god is some old bored dude who is just playing with people by giving them mind and hoping they wo n't use it ? 
  think about what can happen when some right nutjobs gets +50 % seats . 
  freedom of speech and insulting somebody by calling names are a bit different things , are n't they ? 
  not really , having a 1 % parties dictating a conditions can be a serious problem too . 
  but i agree , there should be some mechanism to prevent a situation , when too many votes do not count . 
  temporary lowering a electoral treshold or something like that ,, 
  nah , scaremongering was secondary . 
  free cash for kids . 
  pis was constantly saying how bad situation was in poland for 8 years , and because people have golden fish memory , some people forget time they have been ruling and bought that crap . 
  and proposition of free cash for having kids . 
  did i mentioned a free cash ? 
  anyway , funny thing is , that they barely won . 
  three parties almost got enough votes to get in parliament , but not enough , and 15 % of votes was wasted . 
  that have turned pis result ( around 40 % ) into over 50 % of seats . 
  you give a macierewicz too much credit . 
  he is a simply guy who completely went nuts . 
  well , if something happen to mr prezes , i can image several pis politicians fighting over who represent a true inheritance of his ideas . 
  gon na be fun . 
  i doubt it , sikorsky belongs to lockheed martin and apache is a boeing product . 
  ca n't wait to see lw\u00f3w / lviv under the same flag :d seriously , visiting this city without waiting on border would be nice ( plus city need some painting ), 
  no chance for poland with pis , those guys are economic ignorants and massive budget spenders . 
  anyway good luck romania , maybe it 's their time to shine . 
  i 'm reading local newspaper ( article about idea to built it also in [ rzesz\u00f3w ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rzesz%c3%b3w ) ) and it is described as a `` material '' using a luminescence , so i guess it is not simply a paint , but whole material . 
  that 's make a point , paint will quite quickly grind off . 
  oh , we have a `` hag summer '' too ( babie lato ) , but it refers more strictly to time when spiders webs are flying in air . 
  i love this season , `` the golden autumn '' . 
  by the way , so you also have a name for it ? 
  well said . 
  or we should try made current education system more effective . 
  so far eurocrats arenot messing with polish constitution , pis thinks that having 50 + in parlament makes kaczy\u0144ski a caesar and tribune of the plebs in the same time . 
  barely got a half of parliament , that 's quite far from getting 2/3 to change constitution , and trying to loophole constitution is not democratic , no matter how do you spin it . 
  sometimes politician are pushing some crappy idea or eu monies , like airport , and then it just stay useless . 
  like airfield in polish city [ radom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radom_airport ) . 
  from polish perspective , i think most people will not oppose ko\u015bciuszko being a hero for belarusians , after all , he was from that area and fought for peasants too . 
  anyway a bunch of nobility had ruthenian/lithuanian heritage and were self-polonized , so drawing a a clear line who was who from xx century perspective is pointless to begin with . 
  you know , mickiewicz case . 
  well , i have never checked this before , but it looks lithuanian army did not make it in time . 
  well , i still assume in some units , who were recruiting/hiring volunteers lithuanian were present . 
  [ looks like this guy was there ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/juozapas_boguslavas_slu%c5%a1ka ) , but i 'm not sure it is enough . 
  [ history of belarus in 5 minutes ( with english subtitles ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxlagbg9qkm ) i think this may be a example ? 
  i do n't see what to argue about with simple presentation of border changes ... so i 'm going to boast in vienna battle thread . 
  by the way , it was a commonwealth of both nation victory , so you can join party too , 
  poland was in strong alliance with napoleon , and we wish it . 
  we even have him in our anthem . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fszao1llfy ) , but not in the best quality and this battle : [ siege of jasna g\u00f3ra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_jasna_g%c3%b3ra ) , depicted in movie , is quite well known , jasna g\u00f3ra is one of the most known , or simply the most , virgin mary sanctuary and one of the country 's places of pilgrimage . 
   you seem to treat mistakes from pragmatic point of view , while i just want to point out what you already know is true : that poland was acting based on its interest as oppossed to high moral standards . 
  yes and no . 
  i indeed look at it from a pragmatic point too , but from pragmatic point of view , as said by machiavelli , enemy have to be destroyed or tolerated , bur not harassed , from the other hand i 'm surely not pragmatic to that extent , that could allow me to pick up `` destroyed '' option . 
  i rather do not simply join `` polish did nothing wrong '' or `` poland was imperialistic bad country '' narrative , but , depends on individual case , argue with both , and for both moral/pragmatic reasons . 
  so these days i notices indeed ii rp is a bit mythologised as wonderful country ... 
   on several occassions silesians wanted to join germany or become autonomous . 
  when ? 
  silesians as a separate nation is some xx creation with no big popularity , so i guess you are referring to germans living there before war ? 
  and they autonomy before war . 
  so poland could not break wilson 's right of nations ' self-determination because there were no such nation . 
   i did write ` pre - and post-war ' . 
  when did poland expelled jews before war ? 
  about vilnus , after studying conflict , it became pretty obvious , that giving it to lithuanians would have the same point as giving constantinople back to greece , i mean none . 
  also , unlike lviv case , city was n't separated from poland by vast areas inhibited by lithuanian majority , but polish/belarusians . 
  i like to read about mistakes made by poland , unfortunately pretty often it simply mirroring a `` poland did nothing wrong '' by presenting everything told as wrong as told , without checking . 
   establishing puppet government in lithuania , it was understandable way to help local population again anti-polish nationalistic lithuanian goverment . 
   meddling with eastern border , we should not simply left eastern neighbours without even autonomy , fair point  suppressing silesians , could you explain what do you mean ? 
   acting against czechs closing their schools was bad , taking zaolzie was bad , but quite understandable from prewar perspective , we could play this better though . 
   and slovaks , true , for dream of common border hungary we only got a few villages and whole country and south border completely opened for germans  expelling germans without measure , you mean after war ?
