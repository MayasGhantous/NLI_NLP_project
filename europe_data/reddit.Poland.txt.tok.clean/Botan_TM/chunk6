  sometimes a guy who had problems with his life suddenly became a christian , then he starts going to church or became a pilgrim . 
  or a meditating buddhist . 
  or he finds a fast way to salvation in islam . 
  first of all whole middle east a centre for culture for thousands of years . 
  now is a one of the worst places on earth , thanks to islam . 
  many cultures had worse days , but islam slowly destroyed all cultures and heritage from north africa to afghanistan and india . 
  most of those great `` achievement '' are simply leftover from conquered countries mixed together or transported via islam controlled territories . 
  because some muslims leaders were rather going with their own desires than following quran we got all that nice examples of enlighten there , but now it is also gone with forcing democracy and removing leaders , which do not follow islam . 
  quran is similar to mein kampf , a babbling of totalitarian supremacist intolerant warmonger and so it is suffocating all countries where it gets upper hand . 
  the more people , still calling themselves muslim , move away from it , the better it gets . 
  when islam stops to spreads , then it collapse from inside . 
  communism collapsed when it decayed from inside showing to whole world it is unsustainable . 
  racism and nazism was eradicated when capital of uberhumans , berlin , was drown in blood , showing that they are not better from others . 
  i do n't want to think what is needed to finally stop islam . 
  i was talking about europeans eventually fighting and dying in syria instead syrians , who are coming here . 
  can you capture city only with drones ? 
  good luck . 
  usa tried training `` moderate rebels '' , it did not worked ... 
  instead europeans should fight and die for their country , for syria ? 
  france soon will be similar to israel ... 
  from the other hand , all not nato/ukraine ex-soviet union countries with russian minorities can trust that russia will not hesitate if they try something . 
  in english only though . 
  in polish it 's warszawa ( polish `` w '' sound like english `` v '' ) and it means `` belonging to warsz '' , warsz being a shortened form of the masculine name of slavic origin warcis\u0142aw , or according to folk etymology which attributes the city name to a fisherman , wars , and his wife , sawa . 
  according to legend , sawa was a mermaid living in the vistula river with whom wars fell in love . 
  but `` war saw '' match it really well too ... 
  thats 's ... very accurate actually . 
  well , i wish i could say this about mine . 
  nah i take it with no offence . 
  they will for some reason disband parliament before it happens , a new government will have a hard time fixing their crap , and then after a few years pis will be boasting how good they have been ruling , so well they were able to give free monies . 
  i guess a very wide spectrum of behaviours is count as anti-semite , from simply disliking to being a neonazi `` hitler did nothing wrong '' type . 
  i mean , in europe for various reasons many nationalities ( or at least part of those ) do not like each other , dunno for example slovaks and hungarians . 
  but nobody would go crazy over hungarian saying `` those damn romanians '' , publish articles about them being anti-romanians or something , probably just name him a xenophobe and call it a day . 
  well , afghanistan kings tried to modernize a country in first half of xx century . 
  go guess who opposed that . 
   polish people did n't do much to stop them . 
  this sentence sounds like we could but did nothing , looks like misunderstanding happened , sorry . 
  poles were hardly capable to stop germans from killing poles ... 
  anyway i wonder what such a armchair moralizer would do during a war , when for helping jews in any way you and your family will get bullets into brains . 
  the same guest we ( including pis ) are begging on knees to send some army here ? 
  how surprising . 
  uk even replaced north korea glorious leader memes . 
  even kim looks more normal now . 
  that 's a [ siege mentality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_mentality ), 
  that 's great . 
  i also think this a genocide , although i have n't studied it deeply . 
  still i do n't see why this law is needed , it gives nothing , but may lay a dangerous precedent for future . 
  eastern europeans lived with censorship for decades , and so no wonder we do n't want anything resembling it . 
  also we learnt that such laws even promote such forbidden opinions , and create a distrust to officials . 
  so better stick to a principle rule : ` i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it, 
  problem is about leaving to parliaments to vote what is a real history and what are proven facts . 
  sooner or later it will backfire if somehow some retards grab over 50 % of seats . 
  left history to historians , facts to scientists and foolishness to fools . 
  i 'm just salty , because probably we will buy them too ... 
  let 's hope plane works better than this joke . 
  polish soldiers were seeing a old cars with polish registration numbers in afghanistan ... 
  [ same was said at the beginning of industrial revolution 200 years ago ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luddite ), 
  some may hiding monies in one way or another , but in overall i agree with you . 
  exactly , that 's why this is stupid idea no matter how do you look at it . 
  but we do n't have experts to run it , those alive are in neighbour country or in argentina . 
  dropping english would hurt more eu than anybody else and there is no reason for do it except `` we will show them '' altitude towards uk . 
  and what abortion have to do with this ? 
  is a abortion some new human right now ? 
  atheism ca n't be against abortion ? 
  how is poland not a secular country ? 
  soviet engineering . 
  first engineer design something . 
  then he thinks about materials quality . 
  so he makes it sturdier . 
  then he thinks about work quality of building workers . 
  so he makes it 's even sturdier just in case . 
  project is ready by then . 
  after soviet attack fight lasted only a few days , because such attack made fighting quite pointless and so hq give a order to fought soviets only if necessary and try to move to romania , same day polish government and many forces moved abroad poland . 
  example how soviet attack helped germans [ battle of lw\u00f3w ( 1939 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lw%c3%b3w_%281939%29 ) indeed one could argue that poland would fall anyway , but main difference is what happened after . 
  soviets in opposition to romania or hungary effectively prevented polish soldiers from evacuating to west to continue fighting and severely persecuted poles . 
  simply moving borders and army to create buffer zone without those would not create so big negative opinion about . 
  what is your definition of alliance ? 
  being together because of love , of cooperating at some point because targets are the same , aka realpolitik ? 
  that 's was a shady thing for sure , but very often russian directly compare it with soviet attack in 1939 . 
  poland taken around 850 square km ( approx 30 x 30 km ) from not fighting country , otherwise part of that territory would be taken by germans . 
  comparing this with attacking and conquering half of poland is a bit far-fetched . 
  typical not cooperating : [ gestapo -- nkvd conferences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestapo%e2%80%93nkvd_conferences ) and not trading : [ nazi -- soviet economic relations ( 1934 -- 41 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi%e2%80%93soviet_economic_relations_%281934%e2%80%9341%29 ), 
  munich agreement was signed by germany , france , the united kingdom , and italy. , those countries let germany and others to split it . 
  if czechoslovak ally , france , have not betrayed them , that would not happen . 
  and before wwi, 
  i have heard histories about nice germans and about bloody gestapo and also about some nice russians sharing their rations as well as them taking people from village , which some have n't returned . 
  so everybody have their stories i guess , propably mostly based on their luck which scums they met or not . 
  fun fact - poland had no biplanes in frontline service in september 1939 , [ but germany had ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henschel_hs_123#world_war_ii_.28service_from_poland_to_greece.29 ) . 
  ukraine really did n't really had time to deal with their past and to reform their country , also this was a long going conflict since xvii century in mixed area , where spiral of hate keep raising from both sides . 
  indeed during wwii ukrainians made genocide and we will still go deal with that . 
  anyway , i just fail to see how having a ukraine - russian puppet would be beneficial for poland . 
  ukraine have a long way to go , but it is hard to do when some neighbour found you a ulcer in your side . 
  and so far ukraine is n't performing massive military exercises next to przemy\u015bl anyway , you delivered beautiful example of [ and you are lynching negroes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ), 
  is not that . 
  simple germany apologized , changed and we both moved on . 
  from the other hand russia did nothing about it past , and even it is doing what it is doing - being a corrupt authoritarian country harassing neighbours . 
  article about pis flag program : [ the family 500 + : poland 's new child benefit programme ] ( http://neweasterneurope.eu/articles-and-commentary/1909-the-family-500-poland-s-new-child-benefit-programme ) a bit old one : [ polish budget revision fails to dispel concern over new spending ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-14/polish-budget-revision-fails-to-dispel-concern-over-new-spending ) i think in 2016 budget will do , but what will happen in 2017 ? 
  now it is visible pis is trying to make bigger taxation in different fields , like with a new water law . 
  same thing , same thing . 
  as you said , in theory . 
  i would not be so bothered if they had cut spending elsewhere in order to move them to 500 + .
