  in reality pis just borrowedthat cash , and guess who will have to pay them back in future ? 
  ordinary poles in taxes . 
  national + socialist - both match very well . 
  `` right wingers '' with social spending which could put into shame all leftist parties in poland though . 
  bashing own country seems to be a national sport in many eastern european countries , it is same in poland . 
  i 'm from poland , i know that feel bro . 
  how do you count poland and ukraine ? 
  galicia was part of austrian empire too . 
  well , such stories reminds a story/joke ( i do n't remember what is was ) once a director of orchestra from usa met a colleague from ussr ( apparently it is old ) . 
  they have been taking about different things . 
  at some point american said : `` you see , we are not racist , for example i have 5 jews in my orchestra ! '' . 
  soviet director responded : `` that 's nice , to be honest i just ca n't answer you how many i have in my orchestra , i simply have n't ever thought about such things '' . 
  too much is not good either . 
  if during an attack they have something to distinguish soldiers/militias from civils ( khaki uniforms or some markings like armbands ) then it s not . 
  because it 's like a family . 
  `` that neonazi retard is my brother who needs my help , get lost putin '' . 
  half of poland thinks ukrainian are brothers , other half ca n't get over wwii genocide made by ukrainian nationalist . 
  yes , i know about do not agreeing to cossack . 
  current `` pure evil perpetrators '' view is mostly a result of recent history and oun/upa actions . 
  i know it is hard to deal with difficult past , especially when somebody is attacking your country , but to move forward ukraine have to critically judge ukrainian nationalists from 40 's , who performed genocide , such people , who lived accordingly to \u0414\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430 , simply ca n't be a role model for next generations . 
  no injustice justified a genocide , two things wrong do n't make things right . 
  especially that some ukrainians were murdered too by upa for trying to save some poles . 
  nation is great not when it only `` stronk '' , but when he can accept mistakes . 
  i have no problem with ukrainians ( i was three times there , i even bought a book about ukrainian aviation in after great war period , but reading it will take some time ) , but how can you explain it to for example my friend , who family were hiding and sleeping in stable somewhere around tarnopol , trembling in fear worrying if upa will come to them and not just kill , but also torture before that ? 
  well , i made some quick research and i 'm shocked . 
  i guess you are aware of term `` sch\u0142opia\u0142a szlachta '' - `` peasant ` ed nobility '' ? 
  those rich magnats ( around 3 500 ) were in xix destroying villages and mercilessly kicking out those poles in order to lease those areas to somebody else . 
  [ gdy ukraina by\u0142a polsk\u0105 koloni\u0105 ... ] ( http://historia.newsweek.pl/ukraina-historia-polskiej-kolonizacji-newsweek-pl,artykuly,286899,1,2.html ) so fact that rich magnateria were bunch of assholes is not a new to me , but i not expected it to be to that extent . 
  but even this critical article say , that word `` colony '' is n't a precise one , it was rather a `` feudal expansion '' . 
  well , long story in short , when poland got land of today 's ukraine from lithuania , a lot of rus nobility switched to polish language and catholicism , later those rich feudal lords led to anarchy in country and involved commonwealth in many wars ( like with cossacks ) . 
  so i can agree on point polish rich magnats were bad , after all those are considered as a those , who let commonwealth fall . 
  still , i insist it was rather a class conflict , were different classes become later a different nation and so turned into conflict between nations . 
  indeed you have to read more about past . 
  ukrainians were not treated as property , period . 
  peasants were . 
  it did not matter if peasant was speaking polish , ukrainian , lithuanian , german or whatever , he was peasant . 
  in poland conflicts , misunderstanding and so on existed between szlachta and peasants [ galician slaughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galician_slaughter ) , theme of relation between polish nobility and peasant was a thing in xviii and xix up to the xx century , ( bunch of a literature , a [ ch\u0142opomania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch%c5%82opomania ) , now it is a song of the past . 
  in your case , because szlachta and peasant speaking different language , class conflict mixed with national conflict when modern nation were born . 
  although i ca n't really say if there was a big difference between treating of polish and ukrainian peasant , it could exist . 
  i have heard that peasant were poorer in eastern . 
  i forgot , there also was a conflict based on different christian religions . 
  i have noticed czechs are getting pretty angry after hearing `` czechia is a eastern european country '', 
  close . 
  `` poles are paranoid russophobes '' works pretty well too . 
  in result you conquered most of rus territory and then got a polish throne . 
  you did not bad for some time though . 
  soviet victory - great victory of russia soviet genocide - nothing to do with russia . 
  you ca n't have a cake and eat a cake . 
  in the same time polish units retreating during soviet offensive in 1920 were attacked by lithuanians , so much for your claimed neutrality . 
  root of problem is much more simple : poland could not simply accept delusional demands of lithuania and ceded a territories inhibited by people who do not wanted to be a part of new nationalist lithuania which wanted to eradicate any polish influence and common 500 years of history . 
  poland had army big enough to easily conquer lithuania , but that had no point . 
  sorry to upset you , but i studied this conflict deeply and when indeed poland made mistakes with belarusians , ukrainians or slovaks , here lithuanians mistakes were much bigger . 
  normalizing a relations in 1926 and letting to trade and economical usage of klaip\u0117da would be good for both sides , instead lithuanians nationalist insisted just on fuelling hatred . 
  great britain was simply hindering poland in early 1920 's in result of typical britain policy of `` balancing powers in europe '' , really there is no point in emphasizing this . 
  anyway , i 'm losing a point there , my original comment was n't about origin and conflict , but time after it . 
  poland and czechoslovakia , germany were capable to have more or less proper relations , when lithuania after coup failed to do so . 
  and that 's my point in this discussion . 
  it was lost since 1917 when lithuanian nationalist were jumping between cooperating with germans and soviets and claiming ridiculous demands like having borders basis on ethnic borders from xv century , never accepting any proposition of plebiscite and ignoring voice of local poles by calling them `` polonized lithuanians '' . 
  anyway , situation was dire in early 20 's , when a new government was giving a possibility of any normalization , then after a coup smetona and rest decided , that having north-south korea style border with no contact and relationship + building a new national myth of poland being a eternal external threat was the best idea . 
  pi\u0142sudski indeed was a authoritarian leader , but he was never using external threat as a mean to keep him in power to the extent lithuanians did . 
  the sad thing is that with that possibility of any normalization of relationship with poland was lost . 
  i do n't thing so . 
  he was a former socialist and believed less or more in recreating multinational commonwealth and was against national democracy . 
  after his death things with minorities become worse . 
  indeed [ mother russia is quite big ] ( https://youtu.be/n3lz2gffkeg?t=44s ), 
  maybe , but having experienced specialists from stasi may help too . 
  / joke, 
  you do not get this . 
  rzesz\u00f3w is a student 's city , almost 200 000 citizens , but 2 public universities ( on which i was studying ) and some private too , there is quite a lot of foreign students and lecturers , for example from erasmus program . 
  my spanish teacher was a native speaker . 
  yet attacks on those are rarity , i was surprised when i read news about that attack . 
  we have the best space hero ever . 
  kapitan bomba [ english version - captain bomb - find an exit from a den ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozya7s6fjba ), 
  in poland we call them `` cygani '' , it sound similar . 
  however is ' t a older form and is considered as slightly pejorative . 
  modern one is `` roma '' . 
  good for you is that we call your country `` rumunia '' and people `` rumuni '' , so it is different from `` roma '', 
  i have read comments on youtube under videos with american soldiers in poland . 
  it was quite interesting experience . 
  thermonuclear fusion reactor working as effective source of energy . 
  when europe starts making those , russia without selling gas will have to give up . 
  at first i was surprised , but the i realised , that once i was making a fun of female friend , after her whining about cold rainy weather . 
  in january . 
  rainy in january ... maybe because poles love complaining , so every negative temperature deserve some whining . 
  we have a saying `` escape to forward '' , which means that in some situations only way to deal with problem is to move bravely forward to avoid problem , instead moving back , deali with it or something . 
  in 2007 people were still thinking about fukuyama 's `` end of history '' . 
  surely not as well as your [ mitteleuropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa ) , currently a part of eu plan / s, 
  was n't a old belarussian a official written language of lithuania , before your szlachta voted to change it to polish ? 
  by the way , what `` vytis '' literally means ? 
  number of witches killed by inquisition is pretty small in comparison to germany . 
  and most of those happened on territory of holy roman empire . 
  in territories like iberian penisula or poland those were not happening that often . 
  how those numbers looks like , when you separate witch hunting in catholic and protestant countries ? 
  finland have lost , but only some territories , instead of a whole country . 
  i 'm from poland and from former galicia , so you may be closer than you think ... 
  so soldier is walking on a land , sailor sail on ships , and marine is a soldier walking on water , just like jesus ? 
  ok , so after next partition crap we humbly asks great drawing borders powers to be moved to iberian penisula . 
  rtv is a public or private channel ? 
  do you have public tv channels ? 
  in poland our public television turned to propaganda outlet i mean more than usually , how it was in romania ?
