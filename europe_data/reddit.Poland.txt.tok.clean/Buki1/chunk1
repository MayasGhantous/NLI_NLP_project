by replacing experienced and respected ambassadors , italy and poland , are now at a disadvantage in this regard . 
  so the countries who just had elections which changed ruling party are automaticly considered weak ? 
  or in other countries they do n't change representatives after elections ? 
  funny thing is that pro-russians are calling pis anti-russian , and pro-eu are calling pis anti-eu . 
  it kinda proves my point . 
  but here is kaczy\u0144ski [ speach in tbilisi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls0ftk9hz-c ) . 
  pro-russian af , right ? 
  pis was called anti-russian fanatics by liberal media for years after that . 
  they also damage pl-rus relations , so the balance is preserved . 
  this is basicly `` leave us the fuck alone '' type of party . 
  they would build trump wall around whole country if they could convince germany to pay for it . 
  protip germany & britain : calling anyone `` retard '' does n't make your arguments less invalid . 
  i know a lot of people watching it , but i dont know anyone having much respect for that event . 
  it 's like watching bum fights , yeah , a lot of people watch it , but i doubt anyone would cry over being excluded from this kind of a show . 
  basicly every work day after eurovision all my coworkers only laught about how shitty this show is . 
   again , no mutual border and no separatists willing to join russia in poland . 
  yep , those things definetely stopped russia from attacking poland all those times in history , 
  german foreign politics summarized in one sentence , 
   surely evil russians only waiting for the right moment to take over poland not long time ago we heard from people like you this version of insightful sarcasm :  surely evil russians only waiting for the right moment to take over ukraine and the same thing about georgia before that . 
  good you western europeans are always right about russia being a peacefull neighbour . 
  and vice versa, 
  ns2 is one the reasons a lot of polish people do n't see eu as trustworthy friends and doubt that nato would do anything if russia would attack us . 
  i knew our hungarian brothers will understand . 
  actually , [ poland is currently the safest country in europe and 2nd safest country in the world after japan ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41arpk/according_to_the_new_oecd_ranking_poland_is/ ), 
  this may be accurate this time though , since unemployment rate among young people is always higher . 
  if general rate for whole country is 40 % , 60-70 % for young people does n't sounds unbelievable . 
  edit . 
  yep , [ youth unemployment rate in bosnia is actually around 60 % ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.uem.1524.zs ), 
  and aa missiles at the spot . 
  and do usa care if i have the money to pay if they deport me ? 
  do authorities care if i have a money to pay for the operation if i prank bomb-call the airport and cause the mass evacuation ? 
  you break the law , you pay for damages - that is the basic fundament of our justice system . 
   what 's their country if they do n't declare it ? 
  drop them off at the coast which the boat embarked from . 
  same thing with usa , they send you off to the airport you fly from . 
  if they are migrants from country not at war ( like vast majory of them ) , send them back to they country with the bill to pay for that whole operation . 
  so exactly the same thing that would happen to me if i would try to enter usa without a visa . 
   hipsters are by far the dumbest , loudest , most unjustifiably sanctimonious pack of locusts that has ever descended unto this world . 
  you must be the grumpy old man of your neighborhood . 
   who 's going to pay to make them go back ? 
  and who 's going to pay to make them stay ? 
  [ 3 days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4evq6c/czech_republic_will_be_officially_renamed_to/ ), 
  other way around - the word `` slave '' comes from `` slav '' * late 13c. , `` person who is the chattel or property of another , '' from old french esclave ( 13c . 
  ) , from medieval latin sclavus `` slave '' ( source also of italian schiavo , french esclave , spanish esclavo ) , originally `` slav '' ( see slav ) ; so used in this secondary sense because of the many slavs sold into slavery by conquering peoples . 
  this sense development arose in the consequence of the wars waged by otto the great and his successors against the slavs , a great number of whom they took captive and sold into slavery . 
  [ klein ] * http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slave, 
  slavic people were actually enslaved by ottoman empire ( hence the word `` slave '' ) - so if they want to play that ` history guilt ' game not only we should historically not pay for colonies that we did n't had , but we should ask for reperations from muslims for slavery and every second day we should remind them about their ex-slave owners privilage . 
  but since we are white like american slave owners , no one cares that we were actually enslaved by poc . 
   czechia wow , this name got adopted pretty fast, 
  [ oh , the germans ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqz8p-ukfbc ), 
   and when i visited poland just about month ago there were none of that . 
  well the road girls are definitely still here . 
  backed by a friend of gross with using straight facts like :  could be  difficult to establish exactly how many  could be a + facts gathering job right here . 
  edit : to add to it - jacek leociak is `` literature historian '' not a war historian of any kind , so it looks like the guardian had to reach very far to find someone with history degree to agree with gross . 
  so it was just a prank bro ? 
  * german death camps , not polish . 
  build by germans , run by germans , with hundreds of thousands polish citizens murdered in them by germans . 
   now , do you have any verifiable facts on this subject ? 
  does gross have those facts on this subject ? 
  he did n't present any . 
  that 's why he is asked about it by prosecutors . 
  good . 
  he should be threated like david irving , since he did exactly the same thing - lie about holocaust . 
  you know that `` idea '' ( abortion ban ) is public project ? 
  it was created by citizens who were able to get 100 000 signatures behind it , so according to law in poland , their project must be voted by parliament . 
  you are being downvoted because you turned that fact into `` pis wants to murder woman !!! 1111 '' . 
  get yourself together . 
   in all major tv stations yes , all !, 
  pis took tvp , tvn24 , polsat and puls !, 
  that 's really what media tell you in germany ? 
  my advice - do n't trust them . 
  still leading though . 
   human rights and respecting human rights in poland how exactly changed since pis won the elections ? 
   i hope germany will intervene with army if pis wo n't resign . 
  not sure if serious . 
   ** separate ** constitutional courts  chamber of the supreme court til people in this topic ca n't read, 
  can you quote the full sentence from that `` polish classical book '' that you do n't even know the title of ? 
   you claimed that denmark has no constitutional court really ? 
  let me qoute myself :  without ** separate ** constitutional court that bold word is crucial here . 
  i said that they have no ** seperate ** constitutional court . 
  as i said before - you did n't read what are we talking about and now you are trying to discuss things that have never being said . 
  stop . 
  yep , super private : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb3rtmxh1ua, 
   it 's just a different name . 
  we are talking about separate constitutional courts , not supreme courts . 
  we have both in poland , please first read what this topic is about before you comment , thanks . 
  let 's see what would happen if kaczy\u0144sky would say `` i will slaughter everyone who oppose me '' on live tv during his party meeting , and then will try to defend himself saying that he was just quoting sienkiewicz , 
   h\u00f8jesteret it 's supreme court . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  so switzerland , denmark , australia , estonia , finland , ireland , iceland , luxembourg and many others are lawless wastelands without separate constitutional courts . 
  eu needs to push for tougher action on against those ruthless regimes !, 
  since when having a `` constitunal court '' is a base for democracy ? 
  it was created in poland by the communists in 82 , not really leaders of democratic standards . 
  supporters ? 
  why reaching for supporters when basicly sikorski , foreign minister of po during their rules , was openly talking in tv about slaughtering members of pis comparing them to wild animals ? 
  rather like calling police because you dont agree to democratically chosen movie for a family night . 
  it was previous goverment who beat and arrested protesters , not this one . 
  but then no one in europe though about interventing , since tusk did everything merkel orded him to do . 
  comparing goverment democratically chosen by polish people in election to military occupation by soviets . 
  dude .
