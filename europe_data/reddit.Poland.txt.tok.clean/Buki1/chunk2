   minister of foreign affairs talks about `` negro * politics '' when speaking about relations with usa ** * moor , not `` negro '' - as it is in `` the moor has done his duty , the moor can go '' ** he was quoting the foreign minister from previous goverment , who said that when speaking about relations with usa . 
  not one foreign media center jumped on previous minister trying to make him racist , because he was one of their guys , but they did that with pis minister who was just quoting him . 
  why is that ? 
  you see , the way that media and people like you love to manipulate and straight out lie about some facts is the reason why pis still have high ratings among voters . 
  oh shit , we do n't have courts in poland . 
  good to know there is always r/europe with this kind of information . 
  actually that lady on the right looks like typical slavic babushka from the older days . 
  ca n't wait till razem party will announce big succes of their protest : `` more than 35\u00a0000\u00a0000 polish citizens supported our protest by wearing some kind of black clothes ! '' . 
  do n't stop at it guys , next time go with `` at this day breathe to show support for our cause ! '', 
  and how this is related to the article in op , which is about ignoring state law in favour of religious law ? 
  is there something in ops article about support of the same-sex civil unions among muslims ? 
  * * citation needed *, 
   photos from the demonstration show effigies appearing to be dressed as orthodox jews being strung from rope and set on fire . 
  so would n't it be logical to put those photos in the article instead of describing them to us ? 
   anti-religious state authoritarianism . 
  had this in my country untill '89, 
  it 's in [ polish ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=kazimiera+szczuka+je%c5%9bli+oka%c5%bc%c4%85+si%c4%99+terrorystami&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi27q3bn7roahuss5okhxaqcpuq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=657 ) though  the original quote was said during a radio interview : http://audycje.tokfm.pl/odcinek/debata-z-udzialem-kandydatow-na-poslow-z-krakowa/29476, 
  `` if they happen to be terrorists , then we will worry '' - as said by polish feminist leader supporting massive refugee intake without proper screening somewhere a year ago . 
  now she is silent . 
  and her quote became a meme . 
  we invest in ukraine now . 
  wait for your turn , though getting invaded by russia can speed things up . 
  well it is financed by george soros , he operates globally . 
  even in almost entirely white countries like mine his organizations like `` hejtstop '' are recently trying to fuel some race war . 
  i think it 's a matter of time untill blm starts operating in other european countries , even those with almost non-existent black minority . 
  i do n't get it , obama is `` neocon '' ? 
  because he put that guy in charge of fbi . 
  also obama was an usa president already for two years when syrian civil war started in 2011 . 
  yeah , but damn those `` neocons '' and their fbi schemes and syria bombings . 
  i agree !, 
  where is that bosting in my post ? 
  i just showed some positive vibes happening in europe after pretty shitty weeks we all had . 
  well people were actually pretty afraid of some terror attacks during wyd , so they were thankfull to the people who were there to protect them . 
  plus police , medic crews , military and other people securing more than one milion pilgrims for days and nights were working crazy hours due to the size of the whole event and they did a great job , so people are showing them respect for that hard work . 
   5 beatings of foreigners last 12 months 5 beatings in 40 milion country in a whole year , while basicly daily we hear about dead victims of racist muslim attacks in the tolerant west so petty things like beatings there are not even reported . 
  somebody call the nato intervention in that dangerous poland !, 
  + + citation needed i would like to hear more about those 5 incidents . 
  shit , pis security forces harrasing some good muslim doctorengineer , germany will be concerned about the state of our democracy again . 
  at least that 's a way for us to go to usa without a visa , 
  yes . 
  between `` let everyone in '' and `` we have to kill them before they kill us '' , building a wall is a moderate stance . 
  after first media outrage police commented that the portugese student was not even touched , and the altercation was not racially motivated and no racial slurs were said . 
  tell him that , 
  that 's poverty . 
  they are not politicians . 
  the guy on the right is jan pospieszalski - conservative tv host ( was a pretty famous bass player in top rockband while younger ) , and guy on the left is tomasz terlikowski - a columnist and a book author , a nutjob with extreme catholic views ( think westboro babtist church kind of extreme , the `` pope is a leftist agent '' kind of extreme etc. ), 
  and a running meme . 
   even the ss were shocked at how the native ee population there treated their fellow jewish neighbours yep , they were so shocked that they decided to save those jews by pushing them into gas chambers , because that clearly was better then let them live near those evil eastern europeans / s, 
  that is pretty normal in poland nowadays , newspapers do n't even try anymore to hide that they are biased . 
  every one of them is blatantly telling how readers should vote at any elections . 
  it 's [ patriarchal cross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriarchal_cross ), 
  and from who - usa or russia ? 
   `` european nationalism '' is oxymoron by definition . 
  that is what i was talking about from the start . 
  this is a straw man argument since : 1 ) there is no such thing as `` european nationalism '' 2 ) no one is saying ever that beating innocent people to death ( like those russians in the article he is commenting to ) in the name of one nationality is considered `` fine '' `` european nationalism '' . 
  how did you come to conclusion that those are `` european nationalists '' ? 
  if anything , these are `` anti-european nationalists '' , since the football hooligan subculture in poland is anti-eu to the core . 
  what is `` european nationalism '' ? 
  please give me one example when right wing brawlers beat people on the streets in the name of `` european values '' while waving eu flag . 
  the main difference is that if you want you can still rent a flat and live like a human in england with that clerk salary - not possible in poland , where you have 2000z\u0142 income and 1500zl rent for a one room hole in the city outskirts . 
  add some bills and bus fares and you would have to switch to eating dirt to get by . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  i just took that number from the link above . 
   average monthly disposable salary ( net after tax ) 3,533.61 z\u0142 the way the `` avarage '' salary in poland is counted is controversial at best . 
  they only count salaries in companies hiring more than 9 people , so only 40 % of employees in poland . 
  it also only take in consideration only people on full time contract of employment - while a lot of people are working on job order contract ( around 15 % of employees ) . 
  so it does n't tell you much about salaries of store clerks or any other entry level jobs , which among young people is around 2000 z\u0142 after tax . 
  those are the people who are first to emigrate , just to jump from 2000z\u0142 in poland to 11000z\u0142 in london for doing the same job . 
   but in london at least , skyhigh living costs smooths out a lot of that . 
  agree , though all my friends in london are minimizing costs by renting flats with few friends and basicly living like students in dorms while stacking pounds in saving accounts . 
  this is not living standard good for adult people ( no chance to raise a family while living in 3 rooms with 4 friends ) , but all of them are there to save money and go back to poland eventually . 
   i do n't see a reason why poles should move to west just for a higher salary . 
  4-5 times higher salary is a pretty important reason , you do n't need to look for any other . 
  that sweden where gays are called `` racists '' [ if they want to openly march in some parts of their own country ? 
  ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/27/upcoming-gay-pride-parade-in-sweden-is-racist-say-leftists/ ), 
  because demending justice for rape victims is exactly the same thing as murdering whole race . 
   details how 16 times as many crimes were reported against asylum shelters in 2015 ( 1,031 ) who attacked those asylum shelters 1013 times ? 
  white racists ? 
  this is what this article is trying to push , but that number is hard to believe . 
  or this statistics include all reported crimes inside camps , like the christian churches burned down few times by muslims in calais `` jungle '' and the frequent fights and thefts typical to poor enviroments ? 
  yep , the source that they are quoting wrote : `` m\u0119\u017cczyzna by\u0142 trze\u017awy , a powodem zdarzenia okaza\u0142a si\u0119 usterka techniczna ( tvn24 ) '' - `` man was sober , and mechanical failure was the reason of the crash '' . 
  the russian site decided to translate the second part of that quote ( about mechanical failure ) , but did n't translate the sober part - more so - they wrote `` drunken '' in the title , when they obviously knew from the source that this is not true . 
  why you write `` drunken '' when the source ( tvn24 ) clearly states that driver was sober and mechanical failure of the gearbox was to blame ? 
   anti-democratic chosen by majority of voters in demoratic elections . 
  the losing minority never even though that maybe trying that comedic parody of coup d'etat called kod is definitely more anti demoratic than democratic goverment ? 
   what about taking a few refugees ` ? 
  i read it in bane voice, 
  just stop paying your [ propagandists trying to start some form of pro-russian separatist movement in poland by inviting little green men to our country ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/253370,polish-prorussian-activist-detained ) and we 'll be ok . and yeah , leave ukraine . 
  yeah , i also though war has changed . 
  but then invasion on ukraine started and the battles are not very different than those on wwii . 
  so far the regular ukrainian army was not very good at `` pinpointing and destroying '' guerrillas at their own soil . 
   how could we start fight with them ? 
  well you have some experience in that matter, 
   nearly or just as the germans building death camps to murder the jews vs [ having biggest number non-jews who risked their lives during the holocaust to save jews from extermination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/righteous_among_the_nations ) is obviously `` near or almost the same '' thing . 
  the same way as my cat bully my dog, 
  `` polish death camps '', 
  his first video after the shooting . 
  even in the latest ones about the issue his line is `` seperatists , who have nothing to do with putin , may be the ones who shoot the plane down , but they were aiming at hostile ukrainin mig who cowardly hide behind passanger plane '' - where in reality the theory of even existing ukrainin mig there is planted and supported by russian propaganda . 
  `` poland should n't meddle in the whole russian-ukrainian thing and should just let russia do whatever they want in ukraine '' - who is saying this line all the time : 1 ) kremlin 2 ) `` not-at-all-pro-russian politicians '' 3 ) all of those above plus they said more things than that . 
  like korwin repeating russian propaganda lie that there was special unit of snipers trained in poland send to maidan to help protesters fight berkut , which was almost immediatelly broadcasted by russian media as line `` polish politicians admits that the west organized and weaponized euromaidan '' .
