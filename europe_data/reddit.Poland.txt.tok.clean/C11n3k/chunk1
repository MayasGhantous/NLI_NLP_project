you call muslims in france peaceful ? 
  that 's rich . 
  those are the advantages of being in eu . 
  there is no war in jordan , is there ? 
  between 2007 and 2013 our country received over 67 billion eur from the eu 's budget . 
  where does that 300 billion come from ? 
  also , what is growth of investment over time ? 
   did poland ask any of those immigrants if they wan na come ? 
  no , why would we ? 
  we 're fine with having poles in poland and helping some 400k of our friends in ukraine with working visas here . 
   why dont you ask the polish that are abroad what they think about such policies ? 
  about the fn in france , ukip or bnp in the uk and other similar examples ? 
  when there was the polish plumber in we , how did that make you feel ? 
  good ? 
  western europeans should only give aid to their own ? 
  nice straw man fallacy . 
  we are talking about immigration from africa/asia here , not the inner-eu migration , which is one of the basic rights of an eu citizen . 
  do you even realize why maria sk\u0142odowska left poland ? 
  because there was no poland at that time . 
  but i guess your constricted french mind wo n't understand that . 
  same with rejewski . 
   but hey , lets close all borders because 10000 people can be suuuper dangerous to our social structure and paris terrorist attacks just prove that those people fit in our cultures perfectly , right ? 
   the eu gave you double the amount the us gave to the whole of post ww2 europe . 
  no they did n't . 
  eu funds are like 1-2 % of our gdp so it 's not that big a deal . 
  also if we had received this money in 1945 we 'd be much better off now . 
  good luck to you when you 'll be in the same position . 
  you sound all edgy now , but when you grow up some things are not as easy as they seem . 
  german government 's ideology is conservative islamic communism . 
   there is no party that hates muslims but loves the eu . 
  that 's the problem with germany , either you go full far-right mode or far-left . 
  do you know that centrism exists ? 
  i 'm an eu federalist , but despise eussr which we have now . 
  poor refugees fleeing war , you racist . 
   anything ** but ** good, 
  average quality 22 lr is ~ 0,80 z\u0142 , .38 is ~ 1,50 z\u0142 . 
  safe is a few hundred pln . 
  license is harder to price , you need to be an active member of shooting association ( cost of renting the gun and enrolling to competitions ) and have your sanity checked ( ~ 150z\u0142 ) . 
  i own two handguns , used to frequent a shooting range every week . 
  but the f\u00fch - frau merkel said there are no limits to german hospitality . 
  german nationalism on the rise , beware . 
  it 's worse in southern europe than here . 
  the only clean countries are germanic . 
  same here . 
  i used to be very fond of the eu and schengen area . 
  not so much now . 
  she now wants to accept more immigrants and distanced herself from what cz/sk/hu pms are trying to achieve - no immigration . 
  no wonder , when our pm says one thing in v4 meetings and does the other when pressured by germany . 
  if we were a responsible leader , it might just work . 
  she was merely helping cops to apprehend a runaway . 
  it 's not generalization when proven with statistics . 
   what i meant was that poles in poland have nothing to do with poles who emigrated . 
  no , but seeing you have no flag that might be the case with you , 
  polish immigrants are hard-working . 
  and please do n't generalize , i live and work in poland . 
  he might have used some harsh language but the point stands . 
  people who come here to leech the welfare deserve no respect . 
  hard-working immigrants are a-ok . 
   3.6 % yty not good enough . 
  it 's your chancellor who invited those ` guests ' to eu . 
  reap what you sowed . 
  well this is going to get dirty . 
  shame that germany wants to sacrifice our good relations for this . 
  we wo n't accept it . 
  our government 's agreement to 2k immigrants caused a huge uproar . 
  i 'm sure v4 will do anything to block the quotas and even shrug them off if they pass . 
  plus our nationalists pledged to find every single immigrant and harass him to the point that he 'll want to leave . 
  in exchange for those grants , western europe got huge market to sell their products . 
  i 'd say we 're even . 
  i do n't like the ` they gave us money so we have to do as they say ' whore mentality . 
  from the site you provided :  accommodation , provision of all meals in the centre or its financial equivalent ( pln 92 -- ** eur 2,173 per day ** per person ) , allowance for personal expenses ( pln 50 -- ** eur 12,06 per month ** ) , permanent financial assistance for purchase of hygienic articles ( pln 20 -- ** eur 4,82 per month ** ) , ** one-time ** financial assistance or coupons for purchase of clothing and footwear ( pln 140 -- ** eur 33,75 ** ) , do n't make me laugh , none of those economic immigrants will buy into this . 
  germany gives them much , much more . 
   this is n't even a conversation , just pure nonsense . 
  i have no patience for this . 
  just proves that you have no space in your mind for opinions other than yours . 
  how european of you . 
  you forget again that eu citizens have certain entitlements and those coming from outside the eu are not eligible to free movement zone . 
  i 'm ok with brits coming here and getting shitfaced . 
  not ok with arabs coming here and blowing themselves up in the main square . 
   actually poland is behaving totally arrogant . 
  i will reply with a quote of you : `` yes , but why would i care about that ? 
  between germany and syria there are dozens of countries without war . 
  yet they choose to push towards germany . 
  turkey/macedonia/serbia sure are war-torn countries . 
   in poland with a good support base we do n't have social benefits in poland . 
  free people movement inside eu . 
  not opening borders to arab immigrants . 
   refugees they 're economic immigrants who want to enjoy welfare state in western europe . 
  central europe has nothing to offer them . 
  even if quotas pass , those people will move to germany on the very first occasion . 
   eastern europeans will nevertheless mostly be perceived as criminals and/or leeching on welfare here . 
  racist, 
  kick them all out , hungary . 
  god will know his own . 
  one of a few high ranked eu politicians that did n't buy into pc bullshit . 
  those people lived there for centuries , so it is n't a foreign country for them . 
  apparently we are responsible for holocaust because the death camps were in occupied poland . 
  we already pay reparations to jews living in israel so that 's not a big deal . 
  what happened in the early 2000s ? 
  what about california ?
