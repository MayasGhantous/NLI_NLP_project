  nope , the 2rp did not kill a single ukrainian because of his nationality . 
  they only arrested some hardcore nationalists and sent them to bereza kartuska . 
   accused oh wow . 
  the difference between the wo\u0142yn genocide and polish genocide of ukrainians is that one happened and other did not . 
  bring it on and forget about us being your biggest advocate in the eu . 
  sounds like poland, 
  me too , but in the city centre . 
  lots of people . 
  i guess they did n't know about kazimierz or were fine with staying in rynek . 
  not true . 
  all places were packed . 
  some iraqi who had bits of c4 on his clothes if i recall correctly . 
  he then said he 's working for the swiss intelligence . 
  it shocked me when i read how expensive the road construction is . 
  we really should find a cheaper and tougher replacement of asphalt . 
  anyways infrastructure improvements always please me so enjoy it , muscovites , 
  that 's simply not true but this is not an occasion to discuss this . 
  today we offer our gratitude to those who fought in warsaw uprising . 
  nothing big happened , just a lot of good work from police during the wyd . 
   from the founding of the kingdom of poland in 1025 through to the early years of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth created in 1569 , poland was the most tolerant country in europe . 
  [ 5 ] known as paradisus iudaeorum ( latin for `` paradise for the jews '' ) , it became a shelter for persecuted and expelled european jewish communities and the home to the world 's largest jewish community of the time . 
  do n't forget about the good things you got from your host countries too . 
  sirens yes , but no one stops here . 
   happily enough , as it has gotten richer , it has also gotten more confident in recognising that not everything they were told was right . 
  more like as we got better , socialists increased their efforts to ruin this country . 
  uncontrolled neoliberalism is the best thing that happened to us . 
  no one reads those advertisements . 
  pretty sure buying tyres is not what people trying to relax in mountains need . 
  they only destroy local landscapes because polish people lack basic aestheticism . 
  and people like you who advocate because it supposedly creates money are the biggest problem . 
  there are so many better ways to advertise than [ this ] ( http://www.cozadzien.pl/img/galerie/2015_bis/03.marzec/23.reklamy/_big/reklamy_17.jpg?1427120588161 ) . 
  it 's to be expected considering huge welfare state and protectionist tendencies . 
  let 's keep it classy and use a latin name . 
   how is an axe attack and a shootout even remotely similar ? 
  well as a result of both people die . 
   and as far as i know , none happened today . 
  that 's a figure of speech . 
  do n't delude yourself . 
  you ca n't have a day without news about a shootout or axe attack in germany . 
  it 's important to find faults in yourself too , not only others . 
  yes , according only to the constitution . 
  not the law pis changed . 
  to change the way the tribunal works one needs to change the constitution so the act did n't have any power . 
   article 190 p1 : judgments of the constitutional tribunal shall be of universally binding application and shall be final . 
   article 195 : judges of the ** constitutional tribunal , ** in the exercise of their office , shall be independent and ** subject only to the constitution ** . 
   atricle 190 p2 : judgments of the constitutional tribunal regarding matters specified in article 188 , shall be required to be immediately published in the official publication in which the original normative act was promulgated . 
  no , it 's the other way around . 
  the government did n't publish ct 's sentence and breached the constitution . 
  exactly . 
  both polish democracy and german safety are crumbling . 
   these are voluntary more like opt-out . 
  yes , that 's how it is calculated in most countries . 
  mediana to mediana . 
  cytuj\u0119 :  average polish wage is winno by\u0107 :  a median polish wage is 757 $, 
   fter joining the eu we simply continued to have moderately high growth rates we already had since the early 90s do you understand how percentage works ? 
  [ average polish wage is 4250pln \\ ( 975 $ \\ ) . 
  ] ( http://stat.gov.pl/en/latest-statistical-news/communiques-and-announcements/list-of-communiques-and-announcements/average-monthly-wage-and-salary-in-enterprise-sector-excluding-payments-from-profit-in-june-2016,12,31.html ), 
  that 's just like , your education , man . 
   anti-eu sentiment is so strong there ? 
  it 's not . 
  poland is the [ most pro-eu ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/02/faith-in-european-project-reviving/eu-report-27/ ) state in whole eu . 
  they left in 2000s mostly . 
  the recent decrease in unemployment is thanks to jobs being created . 
  overseas europe ? 
  you mean quebec ? 
  i thought quebecois look like europeans . 
  a breakaway region of moldova . 
  exactly , transnistria is not a country . 
  yeah , some of your fellow countrymen work in it here . 
  by paying for security i meant paying for police 's costs of operations . 
  but as you are here then enjoy your stay ( subsidised by humble people of krak\u00f3w , i guess they call us biggest penny-pinchers in poland for a reason ) . 
  i 'm not blaming you for anything , just saying that organisers of e.g. 
  concerts have to pay for security during performances . 
  wyd does n't and the money is taken from townsfolk . 
  i 'm pretty sure the church is rich enough to afford things like that and not steal from an aspiring city . 
  [ additional info ] ( http://stat.gov.pl/download/gfx/portalinformacyjny/en/defaultaktualnosci/3314/1/48/1/socio-economic_situation_of_counry_in_1st_half_of_2016.pdf ), 
  local patriotism ? 
  quite unusual in poland but strong in krak\u00f3w . 
   what exactly are they getting for free ? 
  security , there 's a police car every 10 meters in whole city . 
  transportation , they pay 15 pln for a week ticket ( it was estimated that it should cost 50 pln to cover the costs of transportation ) . 
  etc , etc. 
  all in all the city will spend 200 million pln ( 50 mil $ ) of my taxes on some random catholics who are n't even a good target of a tourist advertisement . 
  i 'm just wondering who is going to pay us back the millions that are wasted on this event from city 's budget . 
  but yeah , it 's poland so when one bishop says anything , the whole nation nation falls to its knees . 
  i can swallow tourists , at least they leave money here . 
  but pilgrims are the opposite . 
  every russian tank destroyed in donbas is one tank less to worry about when russia invades eu/nato . 
  really ? 
  i 'd vote for her then . 
  but i seriously doubt it . 
  considering the fact that poland has more military personel than the rest of v4 combined and a much more modern equipment , i 'd say we will have the last say in v4 army . 
   mr. orb\u00e1n indicated that he supports the polish proposal for establishment of a v4 parliamentary assembly , in addition to which the group is also working on establishing a joint v4 army ; this would not be equivalent to a joint european army . 
  `` the central european union must be drawn closer together , but it must not be placed at odds with the eu '' , he stressed . 
  `` while the eu exists we central europeans can better assert our interests from the inside , rather than try to do so from the outside '' , he added . 
  this is nice . 
  i ca n't believe that pis and orban did something reasonable for a change . 
   mr. orb\u00e1n also said that at every eu summit he recommends that ukrainian citizens should at least be granted visa-free travel into the european union . 
   in summary , he said that `` there is no sign of stability in ukraine , and the country has lost a significant part of its territory and its population . 
  the previous economic structure has collapsed and its existence depends on external financing ; the cost of the measures required for survival has increased .
