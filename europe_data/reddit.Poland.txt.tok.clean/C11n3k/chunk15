  those boards are plain ugly . 
  i 'm okay with that but using french instead of english is more of a punishment for us than brits . 
   mega sujet triggered, 
  does it work like some mini-schengen ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the eu will not be willing to give scotland any opt-outs so the border has to be a proper one . 
  putting up a border between uk and scotland seems like the only logical step after scotland 's independence . 
  why ca n't scotland have schengen and euro then ? 
  so what are the chances that northern ireland and scotland declare independence ? 
   i used to frequent r/russia regularly until they banned me for disagreeing too often with the consensus ( i swear was n't trolling , just politely but firmly disagreeing ) . 
  hah , same . 
  finally some good news . 
  nothing to be ashamed of . 
  tvp office and the wroc\u0142aw dildo ? 
  really ? 
  but then i saw ukraine and it was all good . 
  damn you schadenfreude . 
  better than another century under their boot for sure . 
  but malta is n't in nato so luckily you do n't get to decide . 
  some nations actually value their independence and are n't brainwashed by anti-usa propaganda sponsored by kremlin . 
   all the poles i meet are complaining yep those are poles . 
  travelling is a torture for cheap-ass poles , the guilty feeling of buying overpriced things is killing all the fun . 
  this , no country comes even close . 
  he 's obviously exaggerating . 
  it 's ~ 1500 pln for 50sqm flat in big cities , not even outskirts . 
  0,3 % of 230m is 690k . 
  yes , they should pay their fair share . 
  i , for one , welcome our new baltic allies . 
  wow hungary just wow . 
  are they going to take our jerbs ? 
  we are the catholic state of poland a and poland b. 
  it is n't . 
  but considering all the facts , poland and czech republic are n't hostile places to lgbt people . 
  iraq , pakistan or russia are . 
  looks like a new hardline bloc is brewing in nato . 
  finally . 
  it 's not our fault that greeks ca n't secure their own border . 
  we 're trying to help , we 've even sent one of our warships to the mediterranean . 
  but this wo n't work as long as greeks do n't take their eu border seriously . 
  from my experience ( after taxes ) : * junior - 1000 $ * middle - 2000 $ * senior - 3000 $, 
  unfortunately russians understand only the argument of strength not the strength of arguments . 
  so that 's what nato is giving them now . 
  no , it 's the biggest polish banknote . 
  [ more scale .

  `` slavs '' is a language group , nothing more . 
   how do you feel about pan-slavism ` no ', 
  absolutely stunning , even more so in reality . 
   a city built by gulag prisoners , with arctic temperatures and huge pollution . 
  sounds like hell , i want to visit there . 
  poverty + free shit = fight for survival it was in 1998 . 
  as long as all europeans have to suffer together because of lack of in-n-out we are all equal . 
  yes , because it comes with no strings attached . 
  free speech ` to be blocked within 24 hours ', 
  we 're not drunks anymore ? 
  also what the hell , slovakia . 
  wait a second , what union are we in , the eu or the ussr ? 
  not bad , hopefully this will motivate employers to boost salaries here . 
  i 've never seen it here , i think it 's a russian thing . 
  floods and russians are the biggest natural disasters we get here . 
  pis are idiots and i hope poles do n't vote judging just by party 's stance on immigrants . 
  but yeah , gypsies are an extreme . 
  what 's wrong with rfe ? 
  it was considered a beacon of free-speech during communism here . 
  the spirits of keynes and lenin are still well and alive , i see . 
  too bad . 
  eu citizens have full rights to move all around the union so yeah , they 're most welcome . 
   is it really a wise idea though to allow a country like poland to decide if a war should go nuclear ? 
  good to know that fellow europeans consider us slave labour morons . 
  maybe this union was n't such a good idea , eh ? 
  then we will take two separate roads , simple as that . 
  but i 'm pretty sure they 'll be able to work things out . 
  we can take the hate , we 're not 5 years olds . 
  do you think that we all are pisspoor unskilled labour ? 
  who cares if that happens . 
  just a prank bro, 
  hofer , orban and kaczy\u0144ski will make europe great again . 
  russia is now beyond pathetic , it 's hilarious . 
  that 's maybe the 3rd evil thing poland has done in its 1000 years history , i genuinely thrilled . 
  now we get to be the evil capitalists . 
  current government trying to influence and threaten judiciary . 
  in a bad scenario they could completely take over the judiciary and nationalize the companies they do n't like ( as it happens in russia ) . 
  that 's what foreign investors are afraid of and that 's why our rating is downgraded . 
  the effects are seen already like nosedive of our gdp growth . 
  it 's vital for polish economy honestly . 
   commies were actually really good in architecture early commies in 40s in 50s maybe . 
  but the commieblock jungle that happened later in warsaw is just ugly . 
  there 's destruction [ and ] ( http://sarp.warszawa.pl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/075-warsaw_ghetto_destroyed_by_germans_1945-770x440.jpg ) [ there 's ] ( https://d-nm.ppstatic.pl/k/r/9d/d6/4ead5fb93e04f_o.jpg?1420066800 ) [ warsaw ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/8/9904/z9904298q,ruiny-warszawy-i-odbudowa-stolicy-po-wojnie.jpg ) . 
  shame that commies had to ruin it with their ugly buildings later but at least the old town got rebuilt as it was . 
  it must have been a really beautiful city . 
   i 'm a brit living in poland . 
  stop stealing our jobs please . 
  one more step to go . 
  hopefully soon . 
   the first link shows that for robberies and burglaries polish suspects have the second highest crime rate . 
  i 'm not an expert on dutch language but you translated it as :  it shows per 100 people suspects of different ethnicity how many are criminals for robbery and burglary . 
  which is close indeed but there 's a nuance : say there would be 1000 crimes committed by a people and 10k crimes committed by b people . 
  out of those 1000 done by a , 200 are robberies and burglaries and 800 are murders . 
  now out of 10k done by b , 1k are robberies and burglaries and 9k are murders . 
  what the statistic posted by you would show is 20 next to a people and 10 next to b people .
