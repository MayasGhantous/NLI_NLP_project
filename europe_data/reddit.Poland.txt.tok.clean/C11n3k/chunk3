  yes , poland, 
  this and let 's build a huge wall around sweden . 
   also please show me that subreddit of the pro-immigration side . 
  / r/circlebroke for example . 
  interestingly you are an active member there . 
   you literally just admitted that you share the `` anti-immigration side '' yes i am antiimmigrant , does that make me racist ? 
  nope . 
   so you might as well fuck off . 
  now you 're impolite and pretending to speak for all just like you did n't want me to . 
  please remember that people have different views and it 's the beauty of democracy that we can discuss them openly . 
  excluding others just because you disagree certainly is n't in european spirit . 
  the pro-immigration side . 
  as i said , the majority of this sub apparently does n't agree with megathread , as downvotes show . 
  any proofs to back that brigading accusation ? 
  had you spent 5 seconds of your precious time , you 'd notice that i do n't post on aforementioned subs . 
  also nice ad hominem , friend . 
  it 's this the time when i call you a sjw ? 
   because reuropean , coontown and all the other funny subreddits that constantly link right here would never ever vote here , right ? 
  and i guess the other side does n't have any subs doing the same ? 
  also what are np links . 
   i mean there is normal day to day shit happening all over europe . 
  nobody really complaining in any of the other active threads . 
  odd . 
  you 'd think if people were really unhappy they would n't just continue business as usual . 
  so we should do a chimpout and spam entire sub ? 
  no , mate , we 're europeans and let 's keep it civilized even though what we are doing here is protesting against censorship . 
   uninterested then why should we care ? 
  i need a source to show me that political correctness has managed to brainwash most people into thinking that critical thinking is racism . 
  source ? 
   socialist party , although it does n't use that word to market itself to potential voters . 
  and also nationalistic . 
  and conservative conservative national-socialism , doh . 
   discuss immigration stop the boats, 
  how about / r/europe megathread ? 
  whole subreddit neatly ~ ~ pacified ~ ~ organized in one place . 
  a long time ago this was called rational thinking . 
  now it 's called racism . 
  in spanish : usa -  ee uu, 
  a wonderful philanthropist and a great businessman . 
  truly a great loss .

  maybe we should disable commenting of ` controversial ' articles ? 
  or disable comments completely ? 
  or rename this to / r/europeleft and ban all non-sjws ? 
  russia has 770k soldiers total . 
  14k is n't a big deal , really . 
  how so ? 
   at the beginning of 2010 the number of ground forces in the kaliningrad special district was ** 10,500 ground troops ** ( excluding the 1,100 in the marine corps ) , divided into one motorized infantry brigade , one mechanized infantry regiment , one missile brigade with 12-18 defense systems otr-21 tochka , one artillery brigade , one helicopter regiment , one defense team . 
  in the army of the kaliningrad special district at the beginning of 2010 there were ** 811 tanks , 1,239 armored vehicles ** and armored personnel carriers of various types , ** 345 artillery and rocket systems ** . 
  [ 1 ] however , by 2012 , the size of the marine brigade in the kaliningrad region is projected to increase to four thousand troops . 
  only 14k troops but a lot of equipment . 
  german, 
  why leave their country in the first place then ? 
  europeans 1:0 immigrants, 
   libya is n't really a safe country to dump refugees pretty sure it 's safer than most countries they come from . 
  i think they have to leave the eu to get rid of euro . 
  balkanization of russia hopefully . 
  no , it means : veni , vidi , viktor vicit, 
  i 'd be all in for south korea scenario ( as in we get technology , know-how and stuff and fend for ourselves ) but russia is just too big an opponent for us , unless we have nuclear triad ( then we could keep them in check with samson option ) . 
  in some completely utopian scenario , if v4 , ukraine , romania and baltic states were to be really helped with modernization the korea scenario could work but then there 's american public opinion which would n't be happy with spending so much money on some far away lands . 
  this is not 60s cold war . 
  the breakup of nato would create a huge power vacuum in present american sphere of influence which russia would surely be glad to extort . 
  hopefully they 'll decide to send more troops here . 
  anyways , thank you usa !, 
  v4 will veto it surely . 
  we wo n't pay for germans ' idiocy . 
  do n't tell me what to do . 
  i 'll downvote him and pay 250,000 euros fine . 
  handball 2014, 
  in some way . 
  they 're basically [ russian imperialist colours ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ribbon_of_saint_george ) . 
   in ukraine and the baltic states ( estonia , latvia and lithuania ) , the symbol has become widely associated with russian nationalist and separatist sentiment . 
  [ 4 ] tomaszewski is a traitor and should be treated as such . 
  greece was n't in the eastern block because communism is for the working class . 
  it looks like preparations for 9th of may parade to me . 
  better safe than sorry . 
  you mean the vice documentary ? 
  we do have some complete nutjobs from onr who are against everything basically . 
  but what an average pole is against is the islamization of europe and arabs coming here to leech off the welfare state ( which we do n't have , luckily ) . 
  german minority is a valued member of the polish society and no one with a sane mind would say anything bad about them . 
  they 're the only minority to have [ seats in our parliament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_minority_electoral_committee ) and they 've always been chill . 
  we have [ bilingual counties in opolskie ] ( http://xq.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3397993/link_qbbrax8ttznmjei5tu50jtk9odwxxkc0,w300h223.jpg ) and p [ olish germans have similar celebrations ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/g/i.aspx/680/0/newsweek/635477975348196406.jpg ) . 
  where does this hatred towards poles come from ? 
  well russians tend to overstay their welcome and then try to liberate the countries they are guests in . 
  i hope you can see why we have some objections about them . 
  well are n't you and lithuanians bff ? 
  i always thought so . 
  same here . 
  that 's good to hear but the relations between our countries could be so much more . 
  wait , i thought only the holiest among the holy attend those youth days . 
  the local government is even going to enforce a prohibition here for this catholic circlejerk . 
  nah , that 's only one guy . 
  check his posting history , he only ever talks about wilno and spouts his nonsense theories . 
   chumachenko mainly focused on world youth day , which is to be held in the polish city of krakow in late june i do n't think many russians were going to come here anyway as they 're mostly orthodox/atheist and not really welcome here . 
  do you even understand what a city right is ? 
  krak\u00f3w got its city rights in 1257 so by your logic the city did n't exist until then and yet it was a capital of poland since 1038 . 
  read a book or two before posting . 
   ** the city ** was first mentioned in written sources in 1323 , when the letters of grand duke gediminas were sent to german cities inviting germans ( including german jews ) to settle in the ** capital city ** , as well as to pope john xxii . 
   therefore , 1323 is considered to be the official founding year of vilnius . 
  gediminas is considered to be the city 's founder even though the city existed years before gediminas ' reign .
