  i did , i was n't talking about the documentary though . 
  central europe needs to fend for itself . 
  no nato `` allies '' will come to our help when it will be needed most . 
  we need to create our own ce alliance that excludes spaniards , brits , germans , etc. 
  who clearly have no interest in fulfilling their chapter 5 obligations because `` it could anger russia '' . 
  from germany 's pushover to hungary 's pushover . 
  thanks america , at least you have balls . 
   popularity of british and german troops in eastern europe . 
  not really , it 's all about having an american on your soil so one of them will die when russians invade and drag usa into the conflict . 
  thank you , india . 
   nowa huta - built by one of stalin 's schemes for the purpose of creating a model of `` the ideal socialist city '' for propaganda and so it 's ugly soviet style architecture in its full glory but that 's not true . 
  nowa huta ( built in 50s ) is [ the most beautiful example of stalinist architecture ] ( http://www.fundacjanh.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/502cdd2ec508dca9d6a827d6c1d9391b.jpg ) in europe . 
  mistrzejowice ( built in 80s ) - which you have posted saying it 's nowa huta - on the other hand ... 
  [ the free , independent , and strictly neutral city of krak\u00f3w with its territory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_city_of_krak%c3%b3w ) was actually one of the best periods for krak\u00f3w . 
  it was a cultural capital of poland during partitions too , because the austrians were cool with polish culture unlike prussians and russians . 
   what actually is the cultural/historical heart of poland ? 
  krak\u00f3w , obviously . 
  finally some good news . 
  who cares as long as confession confidentiality is untouched . 
  obviously german fault . 
  ukraine, 
  let 's sign a deal with , say , chad or other poor but stable country in africa and dump them there . 
  freedom ounces per poofter miles for our american friends . 
  * polish, 
  good for ukraine , i guess . 
  but still , reascending to the gdp they had in 2013 might take a long time . 
  [ full pmi reports ] ( https://www.markiteconomics.com/survey/page.mvc/pressreleases ), 
   when did crimea formaly join the russian federation ? 
  [ 18 march 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation_of_crimea_by_the_russian_federation )  russia is perfectly fine with letting crimea rot between 2 nations as long as it makes the ukraine look bad . 
  you mistake donbas for crimea . 
   no , not only germany . 
  who else then ? 
   and it 's mainly about the founding act on mutual relations , cooperation and security between nato and the russian federation it 's not , you were [ fooled by russian propaganda ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111767.htm?#cl301 ) . 
   permanent nato bases in eastern europe would definitely destroy - together with the founding act - the last remnants of working relations with russia . 
  i thought that nato is about defence capabilities of its members , not appeasing russia ? 
   parties that have ruled poland since the 1990s ( apart from pis ) are secretly controlled by communist apparatchiks ... and pis appointed a commie prosecutor as their parliamentary expert on law . 
  well , then last 18 years must have been great and stable as finally proud congolese were freed from their belgian oppressors , right ? 
  our ? 
  i did n't know poland had any colonies to profit from . 
  by your logic whole eu is a german colony . 
  and whole world is a usa 's colony , which used to be a british colony . 
  which used to be a french colony since 1066 . 
  damn , this * subtle de facto colonialism * is complicated . 
  surely this is the sole reason they 're so poor 100 years later . 
  very popular , broadcast on the main tv channel . 
   but belgium actually does it first !, 
  [ actually was poland ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/czechrepublic/8437924/czech-villages-angry-over-polish-border-fix.html ), 
   liberal journalist geez , you sound like commies when they used to spite `` imperialist journalists '' . 
  time for anschluss . 
  let 's ban banning things . 
  it 's time to protect ~ ~ russian ~ ~ serbian minority in bosnia . 
  - what kind of country do you want ? 
  - just fuck my shit up . 
  they 're fleeing the economical collapse caused by a civil war in their country . 
  seems identical to syrians ' situation . 
  of course the conflict in syria is much more intensive but that does n't change the fact that we should recognize ukrainians as refugees . 
  one could argue that there are some safe places in syria too . 
  we were poorer than ussr in 1938 ? 
  how in the name of potato ? 
  what 's the church attendance in slovenia ? 
  39 % here . 
  we do n't have impeachment , the only body that can remove the president is state tribunal which pis is now in process of taking over by changing constitution . 
  no warsaw or prague ? 
  looks more like `` areas where most money is spent on r&d because we can afford it '' instead of actually measuring output and impact . 
  i went to uk a year ago , there was a lot of women with burqas . 
  when will they stop whining ? 
  russian mofa is beyond pathetic now . 
   pylons in lithuania are painted white and red nice touch . 
  those people not resisting the police look pathetic . 
  a typical behaviour of homo sovieticus - let the police arrest them as long as it 's not me . 
  north or south ireland ? 
  wait , you buy ashtrays for public money ? 
  i do n't know . 
  we allow both , why do n't you ? 
  let 's tear it down and see how immigration falls , right ? 
  just build those fences already . 
  it would be indeed interesting if poland and uk joined forces in developing fcas ; apparently both our countries need to replace old fighters-bombers . 
  but i was talking about present drones . 
  that 's why only responsible countries like north korea get to own nukes . 
  we did ? 
  so the polish minority is finally free to write their surnames with ` w ' ? 
   but this move does probably make the polish government feel like it 's part of the `` in group '' in nato and it 's a great way to politically tie itself even closer to the pentagon . 
  exactly . 
  right now we have nato a that consists of old members and nato b which is ex-commies like poland , czechia , baltics , etc. 
  the problem is russia does n't consider nato b countries full members . 
  we ca n't have nato bases here `` because it would provoke russia '' , we ca n't participate in nuclear sharing `` because it would provoke russia '' . 
  do n't blame us for considering that nato would n't send troops to poland in case of a russian invasion because it `` would provoke russia '' . 
  we have to be a part of the `` in group '' or we 'll be under russian boot again . 
  f-35 is a perfect replacement for su-22 with its fighter-bomber capability . 
  drones are meant for different missions . 
  but we are going to buy f-35s anyway to replace our medieval su-22s . 
  not enough . 
  why ? 
  it would increase the stability in the region . 
  is montenegro basically a pro-european serbia ? 
  [ does it ?

  we 've suffered more from brain drain than gained from eu funds . 
  we and uk were the only countries to join usa in iraq war .
