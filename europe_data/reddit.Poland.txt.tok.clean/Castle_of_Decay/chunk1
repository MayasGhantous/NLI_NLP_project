250,000 euros per year for each person is a ridiculously high standard of living . 
  why work if you get that for free ? 
   ( you should not behave like danish government to take away gold - it is an extremism ) . 
  an even worse extremism is requiring a tribute of annual cash enough to buy and own a large , decent flat in warsaw , just the capital and priciest city of poland . 
  am i supposed to believe that a 4-person family from syria requires a million euro to live for a year ? 
  that 's probably more than the standard of living of 99,99 % of hard-working poles . 
  they 'll soon start to demand to be handed over a majority of this sum directly to their hands , mark my words . 
  i 'd have to work my ass off for at least ** fifteen years ** to earn a net sum of 250,000 euros , and they want it for ** one ** migrant per ** one year ** . 
  are they out of their mind ? 
  do we now need to provide the immigrants with the wealth of a noble ? 
  do they need to shit into golden vases or something and break diamonds to dust every day ? 
  we have homeless people in poland . 
  we have starving children in poland . 
  are we importing desert princes now ? 
  250,000 euros per year ? 
  that 's over a ** million ** annually per person in our currency . 
  this is lunacy , extortion and blackmail . 
  this is madness . 
  european comission shoud go check themselves into a mental hospital . 
   if they do n't want to abide by the democratic , constitutionally sound decisions of the european council and/or parliament , they should push to secede from the union . 
  do n't worry , we will . 
  the last time we had forced relocations of people in poland was by stalin after the wwii , when we were under soviet occupation , with soviet military bases and tanks watching us . 
  how many tanks and soldiers will eu send to enforce its forced relocations now ? 
  yes , much , much safer is to visit a german mall it seems . 
   extensive polling conducted by icm suggests that in most cases attitudes held by the british muslim population do not broadly differ from those held by the population at large , but there are significant differences when it comes to some issues such as homosexuality and women 's rights . 
   trevor phillips , the former head of the equality and human rights commission , said the findings were `` extremely worrying '' as they suggested on many issues muslims were `` nation within a nation '' . 
  52 % british muslims polled want homosexuality illegal . 
  23 % want sharia law . 
   entire populations who are not even involved when 1/4 of them wants barbaric regressive religious laws to be the law of the land they 've migrated into , or 1/2 of them wants lgtbq to be punished ( illegal ) , you can not claim they are not involved . 
   there is also the old style concept of `` extreme patriarchism '' . 
  many hold fast to those values which underpin many cultures , not just islamic . 
  it is this `` extreme patriarchism '' that also contributes to honour killings which you 'll find in varied cultures . 
  sounds like toxic masculinity to me , a very sexist term used by rabid feminists to justify their hatred of men and boys . 
  and even if it 's true , why import people from a culture that condones mass rape and molestation to the point it 's a known past-time there ( taharrush ) ? 
  show me honor killings on the same scale as in islam in japan , poland , usa , uk ( ok , bad example , because many muslims commence honor killings there ) , canada ? 
  if it 's so systematic of global culture , why only the islamic countries have it so bad in modern times ? 
  there is another cause , and it 's secularism . 
  modern west and modern world in general is much more secularized than in the past . 
  islam is antithesis for that - it 's a religion of conquest in its barbaric stage . 
   i have no idea what `` toxic masculinity '' is as this is not a term encountered in the region where i live . 
  maybe you could enlighten me about this term . 
  you do n't read mainstream press much then . 
  ca n't help you with that , i do n't do it nowadays myself . 
  even in poland , the main national newspaper harps again and again how men in general are evil and should change . 
  or try guardian . 
  or new york times . 
   my own personal value is no killing of animals and i am horrified that animals are slaughtered on a daily basis . 
  should i then conclude that all the meat-eating cultures and their people are worthless ? 
  no , i conclude you have n't got your priorities in order . 
  your cultural relativism goes to the point you neglect your personal safety and personal safety of others . 
  a government that neglects safety of its citizens in favor of ideology or multiculturalism is treasonous to their people . 
  not killing animals ( for meat , presumably ) makes you feel better about yourself . 
  not killing gays , women and infidels makes them alive . 
  maybe germany should give the dogs right to vote , will they vote muslims out since islam considers dogs to be unclean animals ? 
  oh , stop whitewashing your genocidal killers ... 
   but branding everybody the same is false diagnostics of the situation not when global terror attacks in the name of islam in the last year vastly outnumber the combined terror attacks made in the names of all other religions . 
  if you care to read the world views , you 'll see what one variable those attacks have in common . 
  islam has a very serious problem with religious violence worlwide . 
  no other religion promotes mutilation so much as islam . 
  when catholic church had a problem with pedophilia , media did n't sweep it under the rug , and rightfully so . 
  the difference was and is that the pedophilia problem was contained to the priesthood while the religious violence problem is potentially spread to every muslim . 
  islam is now at the point where christianity was 500 years ago - during the inquisition and the crusades . 
  our modern values are not compatible with that . 
   so why use blanket terms like `` diversity '' ? 
  the mass media and the left used blanket terms like `` toxic masculinity '' for decades and it was all ok and cool but as soon as the tables are turned , it 's not ok . mass push for diversity resulted in millions of `` refugees '' ( who in fact are majorily from non-war torn countries ) who are clearly incompactible with western values . 
  why , in german pools they must leave notes for the immigrants not to mass rape women . 
  surely a sign of a sophisticated civilisation that did n't teach basic values of humanity to its citizens . 
  this diversity push is making officials blind to the hostile nature of islam . 
  countries with a majority islamic populations are the worst countries on earth when it comes to women rights , religious violence and gay rights . 
  routine honor killings , routine dismemberment for apostasy , religious courts . 
  the punishment for leaving islam in those countries is death . 
  it 's in the sharia law which they uphold . 
  but some countries `` are too white '' and must change without asking their populace . 
  i did n't see jews or protestants going around murdering people for their faith . 
  did you ? 
  it 's always `` lone wolves '' shouting `` allah akbar ! '', 
  or forcing people to read quran or attacking those wearing bad clothes or drawing things forbidden to their religion . 
  but you 're splitting hair - that 's all what the left does . 
  people dead are just a mere inconvenience for the multicultural , globalist agenda . 
  how much `` diverse '' are countries like china , japan , korea or indonesia ? 
  and all those massacres amd attacks lately , with guns , explosives , trucks , everything , have been perpetrated by amish or buddhists , right ? 
  `` oh , it was a muslim again '' after another blood bath must give some people something to think . 
  because we see what diversity for the sake of diversity produced - weekly murders and constant terrorist threat . 
  but maybe you like what the french minister said , that the people should adjust to the mass massacres and just live with it . 
  and they shouted `` allahu akbar '' just to say `` hello '' to their fellow muslims ? 
   i really do n't believe that starting a fucking war over it should be an option !, 
  stop ** any ** incoming `` refugees '' until they are ** thoroughly ** vetted . 
  stop defending islam in media so much . 
  deport ** all ** refugees who commit crimes like rape or murder . 
  stop covering up islamic crimes . 
  stop promoting diversity for the sake of diversity . 
  a diverse city where its inhabitants live every day in fear is a hell hole . 
  eliminate sharia law and no-go zones completely . 
  shut down ** all ** mosques which preach hatred . 
  basically , islam needs to lose its protected status in the west , now . 
  otherwise when the islamic killings increase further , yes , you ** will ** have a war . 
  if the government does n't protect its citizens , those citizens will finally act . 
   i 'd say it 's fair to assume at this point but it 's this kind of rhetoric that has probably motivated the attack . 
  an 18 year old german/iranian has likely gotten fed up with being called a foreigner/terrorist/isis / kanaken and in his poor mental health has lashed out , horrendously . 
  same as in paris , same as in nice , same as the axeman , same as in orlando , same as in ...
