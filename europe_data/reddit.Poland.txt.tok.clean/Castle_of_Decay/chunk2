  there seems to be a surprising number of muslims with poor mental health whose first impulse is to kill as many infidels as possible with whatever means necessary . 
   i 'm in no way preaching any leftist solutions to a scary problem that 's right , you 're not preaching any solutions . 
  your solution is to sweep the problem under the rug in hopes it wo n't fester much . 
   if you disagree with that definition that 's ok , find another one and update the wikipedia entry . 
  i 'd rather trust the armed muslims with assault rifles who tell me that if i draw muhammad , i 'll be shot than a wikipedia article . 
  yet . 
  there is no equality in front of the law when stopping crimes against one half of population will receive more funding and harsher penalties by default . 
  this is injustice . 
  men are primary targets of violence and murder in all developed countries , plus they are 4-5 times more likely to die of suicide . 
   to be against violence that targets people who are in a weak position is n't that bad of an idea . 
  so it 's a good idea to be in favor of violence against men because they 're statisticaly stronger ? 
  do you know women use things like knives and other weapons more widely than men in domestic violence situations ? 
  do you think a petite girl can not severely hurt a burly man with a knife ? 
  brexit , grexit , polexit , hunexit , it looks like the only union left will soon be islamic :p, 
   how is it fair when france and the uk , the benelux , estonia , spain , greece , etc are all in the eu ? 
  why should they pay because you feel germany owes you something ? 
  how is it then fair to pay for foreign economic immigrants invited by merkel ? 
  why does she get sharing when it was her own irresponsible decision to do so ? 
  i do n't owe them anything . 
   this single story hardly matters does it ? 
  then a single statement of an ambassador does n't neither . 
   nations like poland joined the eu as a get rich quick scheme . 
  they were sold some idea that everything would be bright and shiny and in ten years they would all be as rich as germans . 
  this is not true of course . 
  you mean the exact same germans who killed 3,000,000 of ethnic poles during wwii , razed our capital to the ground , stole gold and art by whole loaded trains and never paid a cent of reparations ? 
  who used our people as slaves during occupation ? 
  you mean france and england who betrayed us during wwii ( we were allied ) and then gave us to stalin for 50 years at yalta ? 
  i 'm sorry , germany owes us poles much , much more than any syrian refugees . 
  my grandfather has broken bones which occasionally require medical attention to this day . 
  he was a german slave in konigsberg , he was severy beaten when he did n't do forced labor fast enough . 
  your high and mighty `` founding nations of the eu '' were always based on their own selfish interests . 
  did merkel ask anyone before she invited all those people to germany ? 
  of course not , the chancellor of europe has no need to . 
  as for the prosperity of the west and germany in general , well [ some of companies profitted nicely from the war ] ( https://www.quora.com/which-german-companies-operating-today-were-involved-in-the-holocaust ) , including from forced labor of polish people . 
  but i 'm sure it does n't count since we 're white . 
  well , i 've seen that `` truth '' about [ `` economic migrants '' ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraine-war-deserters-16000-troops-abandoned-military-conflict-began-kiev-official-2127502 ) ( btw , that 's just military deserters , not counting yet undrafted young men in age ) . 
  the ukrainian ambassador may present the version that does n't embarass his own country and his own government but that does n't automatically make it truthful when it can be independently verified by speaking to people . 
  he can qualify people fleeing from dying on the front as `` economic refugees '' if it lets him sleep better at night . 
  edit : there is a bar near where i live full of ukrainian `` economic refugees '' working there who are all young , healthy men in the draft age . 
  i wonder why . 
   you 're comparing arguably failed states with states of the eu . 
  i am comparing arguably failed states that the states of the eu ** invaded ** based on reasons of not `` following democracy '' . 
   everything that happens to/in your country is placed in this framework of x against the poles/poland which in my personal opinion is such a big obstacle for moving ahead with your beautiful country . 
  half of polish press is german-owned . 
  this is no conspiracy theory but a simple fact . 
  i think no other country in the world has allowed for their neighbour for such a great takeover of something so important in a democratic nation . 
  now , all i see in this press when i walk pass the news stalls is critique of the new government on the covers . 
  on every single issue . 
   you 're no longer living a world in which you 'll have german tigers rolling across your border at any point . 
  they have our newspapers , why send tanks when it 's cheaper to influence what we think ? 
  :p  you 're part of a community now and pulling up your borders and pointing outwards for your ills is n't going to get you anywhere . 
  sounds more like a mafia than a community to me . 
   in poland they elected the pis after years of economic growth . 
  when most of the people are employed on something called widely `` trash agreements '' , with no holiday , no socials , no medical cover , no guarantees of employment etc. 
  it 's a common practice these days , majority of companies only offer such deals . 
  i am on one currently as well . 
  it 's a societal problem the last government ignored . 
  but sure , let 's take care of economic `` refugees '' first !, 
  then call people uncivilized for expressing a differing opinion . 
  how elite of you . 
   that is real politik , dealing with problems as they come , not the world as you wish it to be . 
  merkel does n't know real politik if it hits her . 
  minsk agreements , her unresponsible immigration policy , failed coverup of cologne , everything screams she is a weak leader who has no real control and mistakes fuzzy , good feelings with hard facts . 
  let 's invite millions of refugees in without vetting them at all , what could go wrong ? 
  multiculturalism !, 
  social justice !, 
  compassion !, 
  she did n't ask anyone else first , but when it blowed in her face she immediately cried for help . 
  realpolitik ? 
  pathetic . 
   the only refugees poland saw were those on their way to germany . 
  let 's just ignore those hundreds of thousands of ukrainians from a neighbouring invaded and partly annexed by russia country , fleeing from military conscription . 
  they have improper skin color and religion after all , right ? 
   then the poles decided it was time to elect a government , with quite a big majority mind you , that will undermine their republic . 
  see , this is the problem . 
  you do n't like democracy when people choose things you do n't personally like . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm sure you can still build your socialist utopia somewhere else if you try hard enough and send everyone who disagrees to some kind of a reeducation camp . 
  for their own good , of course . 
   it was a mistake to let eastern european nations like poland join the eu . 
  your political culture as well as your everyday culture are not compatible with the european project . 
  enjoy your democracy while it lasts , westerner . 
  the upcoming caliphate wo n't hold dear any of the freedoms you supposedly hold so dear : freedom of religion ( punishment for deserting islam is death ) , equality of the sexes ( women hold no position of influence in islam ) , freedom of expression ( 40 % of polled `` moderate '' muslims in uk support criminal blasphemy laws ) . 
  you can not even draw a cartoon freely without being blown to bits or being shot to pieces , your cities have no-go zones and stockholm is europe 's capital of rape . 
  your current version of the `` european project '' is a dismal failure . 
  ask the britons what they think of that . 
  are they uncompatible with your refined political culture as well , or are they simply more intelligent than you ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  angela merkel was caught on the mike chastisizing mark zuckerberg of facebook to conform to her definition of `` hate speech '' and to censor facebook posts she deemed politically wrong . 
  now , this was adopted a few days ago by the whole european comission with help of microsoft , google , facebook and twitter . 
  all championed by a former stazi-member from angela merkel 's own government . 
  what a coincidence , right ? 
  so the press has a `` political agenda '' and it 's not proven ( yet ) it comes directly from the government . 
  yet somehow , it 's very convenient for the political situation of the current censorship-prone german government . 
  what a coincidence , right ? 
  and the regional government said the whistleblowers from cologne should be prosecuted . 
  free press , riiiiight . 
   most leftist governments have not thrown out the constitution . 
  they did so with adopting of the istambul convention about violence against women , which clearly violates the rule that every citizen is equal before the law . 
  now , crimes against ** some ** of the citizens ( based on their gender ) are to be treated more harshly just because they have something else between their legs . 
  half of the citizens are now more protected by law than others , based purely on marxist-feminist agenda .
