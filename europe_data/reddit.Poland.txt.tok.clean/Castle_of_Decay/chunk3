  if that 's not throwing out the constitution then i do n't know what is . 
   since when is adherance to rule of law or democracy a competition where you point to other countries to justify your own wrongs ( irregardless of whether they are correct or not ) ? 
  since the invasion of iraq , afghanistan , libya and now supporting of armed insurgents in syria . 
  countries which do n't uphold democratic principles themselves ( germany for instance ) should not instruct others . 
  and i 've seen german press ( same press so hesitatant to report about cologne ) attacking poland incessantly . 
  and since german press reports what angela merkel wants ( and now facebook , twitter and google is also compelled to do so ) , then this is a german attack on the souvereignty of poland . 
  the inquisition also wanted to help those people they 've burnt - by saving their eternal souls . 
  giving someone eternal bliss is worthy of a few broken eggs , right ? 
  right ? 
   the fact that you care about what a newspaper says than what pis is doing says a lot . 
  just the second biggest newspaper in poland by a slim margin , and the first `` serious '' one ( `` fakt '' is seen as complete sensational garbage ) . 
  also extremely anti-government , criticizing the ruling party , current president at the slightest occasion ( and often without ) since the moment of the elections . 
  hell , on the day they announced the results , adam michnik , the newspaper 's famous editor-in-chief since its inception in 1989 was very livid and angry as shown on youtube videos . 
   if it was a leftist government you would be all for those protests . 
  if it was a leftist government there would be no investigation from european union , let 's be real . 
  the eu commissions are very heavily slanted to the side of the left , as seen from openly pro-feminist , pro-social and anti-religious ( as long as it 's not islam ) law drafts and messages . 
  and what did venice comission said about the government of angela merkel censoring press to stop politically inconvenient information from getting out , like in the case of cologne ? 
  did they do an investigation about the rule of law there ? 
  how can you have democracy without freedom of the press ? 
  in poland , some of the press is openly critical of the current government and digs up ** any ** information inconvenient to them . 
  this is what democracy looks like , maybe germany and the venice comission should take notes ? 
  it 's still better than in france , where drawing muhammad can get you and your co-workers shot . 
  you mean like germany , which tried to bury down the fact of mass sexual assaults in cologne by influencing the press for political reasons in a `` democratic '' country ? 
  or persecutes a comedian for criticism of a foreign head of state ? 
  such human rights i see . 
   but still , why would you vote for these clowns or support these constitutional changes they are making ? 
  because the other clowns were merely germany 's bootlicks and angela merkel is hell-bent on destroying her own nation with means of uncontrolled mass-immigration . 
  we polish like our nation and our national heritage , our ancestors fought for the very privilege of being able to openly speak polish . 
  we do n't want sharia laws on the streets and our country changed into another islamic state by blind politicians . 
  what is really causing dread among people is the spectre of millions of `` refugees '' from barbaric countries where treatment of women is abhorrent . 
  i 've spoken to my female collegues in previous work , and they were all frightened by what happened in cologne and how the german government actively tried to hush it up . 
  this is what real dread is - the feeling of fear for your own physical safety . 
  and seeing from brussels , paris and cologne , the western eu so hasty to condemn poland has no clue how to keep their own citizens safe . 
  but only after it was repeated by most foreign mainstream media as fact ... 
  funny how they `` support '' democratic elections so much when they lose . 
  and if there is no gay community in a very small nation , one must be created by force or it 's not `` equality '' ? 
   on october 8 , 2015 the outgoing polish parliament ( sejm ) , led by a civic platform being the main party of the governing coalition , elected five new constitutional tribunal judges . 
  three of them replaced judges whose nine-year terms had expired , while two were supposed to replace judges whose terms were going to expire soon after the election . 
  [ 1 ] the judges were chosen on the basis of a law passed earlier , in the summer , by the po controlled sejm . 
  at the time of the judges ' election , opinion polls had shown that the civic platform was likely to lose the upcoming polish parliamentary election on october 25 . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] if the po selected judges had taken their seats on the tribunal , the result would have been that 14 out of 15 constitutional tribunal judges would have been selected by the civic platform . 
  from your own link . 
  a political party fares badly in polls , elects unremovable constitutional judges for 9 years weeks before the next party takes power . 
  oh look , this was not the right-wing pis , but leftist-centrist po who started the conflict . 
  i repeat :  ** two were supposed to replace judges whose terms were going to expire soon after the election . 
  ** does this sound fair to you ? 
  deciding who can come into your country and who can not is not outrageous , it 's the basis of national souvereignty . 
  no country on earth has an obligation to accept anyone just based on their pretty eyes . 
  asylums are ** granted ** , they are not a right . 
   the problem really is that the german bureocracy was not prepared for such an influx of people and is not great at fixing that and not that there is no policial will . 
  but angela merkel said they will manage , surely she was n't lying or making a big mistake ? 
  :p any country which cedes control over their own borders to others loses its souvereignty . 
  we should pay greece and italy , but for a couple of destroyers to patrol the mediterrean sea and for some electrical fences . 
  and yes , we should start to immediately deport every non-syrian economic migrant , from morocco , algeria or afghanistan . 
  and arrest ** every ** bureaucrat who allowed 30-year old `` children '' unchecked into europe . 
  they were n't of much use anyway . 
  the only sustainable solution is to fix the leak and not let in any economic migrants . 
  your `` solution '' is like pouring water to other boats in the middle of the sea instead of plugging the leak . 
  it only guarantees failure for everyone , merely a prolonged one . 
  moral principles should be secondary to continued survival . 
  otherwise you wo n't have them for very long . 
   frankly speaking i would too , the location they got moved to was a very middle-of-nowhere agricultural shithole . 
  decent housing and living conditions but no work to be had for a refugee in miles . 
  i see you still believe in `` syrian doctors '' ? 
  most of those young , healthy male individuals are only qualified precisely for agricultural shit slinging , so to speak . 
  they do n't know language , they do n't have education , what do you think they 're capable of ? 
  except causing some mayhem , of course . 
  plus a lot of people like to forget that po supported some very unpopular projects , like acta for example , the reviled law which would regulate whole european internet . 
  po 's leader donald tusk ( who is currently the eu official ) was extremely and visibly annoyed that mass demonstrations occured against acta and only changed his tune after a prolonged struggle . 
  there were also leaked tapes which showed po from a very , let 's just say , unflattering side . 
   lately a portuguese student ( erasmus exchange ) in rzesz\u00f3w was attacked , because somebody took him for an arab . 
  latest news from the prosecutor 's office seem to confirm it was a political hoax . 
  that student was n't called any rasist names or in any way physically attacked , according to the prosecutor 's statement . 
  the papers which reported it did it just before president duda 's ( he 's also `` right-wing '' ) visit in portugal , and they 're widely known for their anti-government rhetoric . 
  it was `` gazeta wyborcza '' , the biggest newspaper in poland which is openly supportive of civic party ( po , the opposition to ruling pis ) who reported on this which was reprinted by portugal media . 
  looks like it was a part of the current internal political struggle with the opposition that could n't accept losing the elections . 
  never . 
  merkel is already working hard for us to pay for her migration promises . 
  so you say we should abandon our souvereignity when it 's clear that the majority of the nation does n't want mass refugees in poland ? 
  got it . 
  yeah that 's gon na happen . 
  we destroyed communism , we can destroy european union before we will become slaves . 
   that 's not accurate . 
  160k was the total number to be distributed . 
  for now , with the hundreds of thousands still pouring in , and with 250,000 euro fines per refugee in plans for all ** future ** migrations . 
   third : unless you were born in the '50s it has not much to do with you personally ... no , absolutely not . 
  just my grandfather and grandmother were literal slaves for the germans in their slave camps in konigsberg . 
  no biggie , just some problems with mangled bones which never got mended together after a german beating of a polish slave . 
  now we pay medical expenses due to that , so nothing ever touches me personally . 
  no sir . 
   germany = / = eu , but they do pay one of the highest amount to keep it up so they get to have a word how things go ... how convenient !, 
  merkel acts like a de facto dictator of eu , but when it 's about responsibility , she will never do that . 
  announce that millions of migrants can go to germany ? 
  ok . take responsibility for her unilateral decision ? 
  she cries for the whole eu to `` share the burden '' . 
  how convenient indeed , ms merkel . 
  no decision you ever made can make you responsible for anything !, 
   favors to the eu ... or did you forget that this whole migration thing also puts a strain on italy , greece and other countries ? 
  or maybe you think that it is actually possible to hermetically seal all the borders right now ? 
  for 250,000 euros per migrant annually , we can afford a few destroyers patrolling the mediterrean sea and a few electrical fences .
