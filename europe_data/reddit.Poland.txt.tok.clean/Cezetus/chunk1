it 's sometimes called orgasmus for a reason . 
  but it was in response to a literal interpration of what he said . 
  it 's like you did n't get it . 
  so much monies . 
  $ _ $ but seriously , though , i wonder what is the cost of bringing 1kg of stuff back from leo as opposed to putting it there in the first place . 
  it was sarcasm , bro . 
  buuurn . 
  right at the apoapsis . 
  oh boy , here we go . 
  it 's supposedly the shittiest part of the silesian metropolis . 
  there 's this joke about it :  breaking news - russian airforce carpet bombed sosnowiec , leveling the town to the ground . 
   the damages were estimated at tree fiddy . 
  we ai n't giving up on relevancy anytime soon . 
  i do n't usually stir shit up in the comments , but i 'm touchy when it comes to our involvement in wwii . 
  we can not let history get blurred and misinterpreted . 
  whoever you are , i want to hug you . 
  and then we 'll get piss drunk together . 
  ^ i ^ hope ^ i ^ got ^ it ^ right ^ this ^ time . 
  oh , i 've been wangernumbed !, 
   2.3 that 's a numberwang !, 
  football . 
  volleyball/handball . 
  whatever we 're currently winning at - athletics , winter sports , formula 1 . 
  i suppose that the greatest national sportsman we 've had when my generation was growing up was [ adam ma\u0142ysz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adam_ma%c5%82ysz ) - famous ski jumper , 4 times world champion . 
  he used to be all the rage back in the day ( early to mid 00s ) . 
  everyone , no matter the age or sex , whether they were interested in ski-jumping or not , had to watch all of his jumps . 
  it truly was a national sport back then , uniting families and neighbors in front of tvs waiting for his turn . 
  this phenomenon was dubbed `` ma\u0142yszomania '' . 
  he ended his ski jumping career in 2011 and now he 's a rally driver . 
  do n't tell anyone , but here 's a whole stash of these things . 
  [ a palm right in the middle of a street in warsaw . 
  ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110729073438/warszawa/images/b/ba/palma_warszawa.jpg ) the buildings look american-ish too , so it 's almost like miami . 
  i am * so * making these right after i finish [ tres leches ] ( http://pixelatedcrumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/tres-leches-cake.jpg ) . 
  they look amazing . 
  i do n't know about lublin , but in my town it 's 24 p\u0105czki in 20 minutes . 
   count me in !!, 
  they 're held almost in every city . 
  i 'm sure you could try and set the new record in lublin or bia\u0142ystok . 
  because this is how it 's spelled on wikipedia . 
  i assume that this spelling is easier to read for anglophones . 
  [ my not-really-danishes with cherries . 
  just get together a few of our babushkas and you wo n't be able to leave the table . 
  there are byoreks , but they 're typically eaten with meat , cheese etc. 
  so they do n't really fit the album 's theme . 
  lavash is not sweet either , but at least it 's ` neutral ' . 
  i did . 
  no apples - no apple pie . 
  corrected . 
  thanks for the heads up . 
  oh well , then i was lied to by the recipe i 've used . 
  i 'm changing the picture right away . 
  wikipedia lists it as a hungarian cake even though it 's mostly a slovakian pastry . 
  i got confused and went with laskonky because i was sure of their origin . 
  apologies to the citizens of andorra , macedonia and liechtenstein for your countries do not have obvious national pastries ( or at least i was n't able to find them ) and they had to be omitted . 
  in polish , kottbullar sounds like a dish involving cats in diner rolls . 
  d : you cruel swedes , you !, 
  my cabbages !, 
  they were put behind the bars for their own safety . 
  honestly , musically speaking , the song was atrocious . 
  i 'd rather name things that seem kind of normal . 
  i did n't say that . 
  what the hell , europe . 
  ah , fuck it . 
  i 'm voting for iceland . 
  they 've never went anywhere !, 
  even at night , you can feel their presence somewhere in the darkness . 
  whose ? 
  flair up !, 
  it 's from today 's performance . 
  [ euromaidan votes for poland ] ( http://c3201142.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/comment_rshpaatuf9yc1vcxtogtxjpp4yl6kmjm.jpg ),

  scooby-dooby-what ? 
  he gives a fair share of snarky comments to everyone . 
  it 's fair . 
  i think it 's spreading all over europe . 
  it 's the same over here . 
  italy , woah . 
  very cool . 
  russia gets you , though . 
  just wait for your turn . 
  not really . 
  i quite liked it myself . 
  they were n't as good as iceland , though . 
  damn right , we did !, 
  it would be such a great movie . 
  both gripping and thought-provoking . 
  in other news . 
  chinese tanks fired upon a russian tractor plowing a field near the russian-chinese border . 
  after having retaliated with a rocket barrage , the tractor flew off in moscow 's direction . 
  i did n't notice that . 
  i thought they 're on the chart , but apparently they 're not that likeable . 
  i like how the reasons and their colours are related . 
  blue = food = [ blue cheese ] ( http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/cheese/blue_cheese/17_blue_cheese_after_2_mos_p5110355.jpg ) , white = people = native frenchmen , red = wine = well , wine ... 
  and now he 's [ a rally driver ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/4/9481/z9481704q,adam-malysz.jpg ) . 
  but his wife still hungary . 
  also cold . 
  such is life . 
  is of too late .
