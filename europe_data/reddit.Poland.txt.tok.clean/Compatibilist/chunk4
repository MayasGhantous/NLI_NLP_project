  i hope they will squirm like the fucking worms they are . 
  however , lying to their electorates is not new to them : they 've been doing it for years with regards to greece ( like saying they 're bailing out greece and not the european banks ) so it will not be that hard to come up with some `` creative '' ways to spin it . 
  it 's not like the eu is overly democratic . 
   no , because the current narrative is `` greece is the only ` bad student ' , syriza is incompetent , other countries are recovering '' . 
  the only fear is speculation attacks on countries like portugal , but there 's also a very high chance that in keeping with this narrative , assuming the political situation in these countries does n't change ( and they do n't elect their own syriza - which if greek exits they most likely wo n't ) , they might be much more willing to do anything to save these countries . 
  ( and it might be much more politically feasible back home to do exactly that ) this will not allay the fears of people and prevent a bank run . 
  once they see a country exiting ( ** for whatever reason and under any circumstances !, 
  ** ) , they 'll absolutely move their capital . 
  it does n't cost them much and they 'd be foolish not to . 
   the problem is the precedent . 
  if they accept that proposal ( which includes debt restructuring ) , they 're setting the precedent that any country with problems like portugal and spain can get debt restructuring under the same conditions , all they have to do is to elect their own `` syriza '' . 
  denying those conditions to those countries would be impossible after such a precedent is set . 
  that is a de facto transfers union . 
  why does your abovementioned explanation ( of why a bank run wo n't happen after grexit ) not apply to this kind of situation ? 
  you do n't understand what i 'm saying . 
  grexit would precipitate a bank run in other countries . 
  it 's not greece itself that would kill the ez . 
  if the ez collapses ( which , as i explained , will eventually happen if grexit happens ) , they will have much more to worry about than some unruly parties in the southern periphery . 
  do you know why they will be allowed to access them ? 
  precisely because the eu will fear grexit ( for the reason i explained above ) . 
   the fear for a bank run in the periphery countries can happen , sure , and it 's what will end up deciding if the ez folds or not . 
  the risk is n't that large right now , though , since greece is a relatively small country and none of those periphery countries currently has a party like syriza in power . 
  the eu politicians have shot themselves in the foot by bluffing about forcing greece out of the ez if greeks vote no . 
  by saying this , they 've raised the stakes and increased the fear of a forced grexit not being the only forced exit out of the ez . 
  so the fear , i think , is higher than ever and there would definitely be a bank run . 
  a transfer union is not the most likely scenario . 
  if the eu gets its act together after a no vote ( and somehow becomes much , much wiser ) , they will accept something like varoufakis ' modest proposal ( which is not a transfer union ) but even that is not the most likely scenario . 
  it 's hard to predict but i think it will mostly be business as usual , only with better terms for greece ( something that even the imf supports ) . 
  can you respond to my comments and not keep editing existing ones ? 
  the mainstream syriza does n't want grexit . 
  the voters do n't want grexit . 
  eu will not give them a deal that would force them out ( i.e. 
  they will fold ) because it does n't want grexit , as i explained . 
  why would that change after a no vote ? 
  the mainstream syriza does n't want grexit . 
  the voters do n't want grexit . 
  can you explain how exiting would help them `` deal with the situation '' ? 
   and in my opinion , i do not think the ez will fold to `` no '' winning . 
  if they did , they 'd be creating a precedent and guaranteeing podemos wins in spain , as well as similar parties in portugal and other such countries . 
  if the choice is between greece leaving , or having to debt restructure spain in the near future after a podemos win , i do n't think many of the creditor countries will fold , especially since most of them have to ratify any deal in parliament . 
  the scenario you 're describing is exactly the scenario of greece being forced out . 
  that 's how it would happen : they would be kicked out by being given an offer they ca n't accept . 
  so you 're contradicting yourself : in the first 3 paragraphs , you 're saying they would n't be forced out but would leave voluntarily . 
  in the last paragraph , you 're describing the exact scenario of them being forced out . 
  this scenario will ** not ** play out for the following reason . 
  if greece were to exit the ez , the ez would fall like a house of cards because there would be a run on banks in the periphery countries , precisely because people ( in the periphery countries ) would think they 're next in line to be kicked out . 
  the risk of this is higher and the consequences would actually be much more dire than , say , in 2010 because the economic situation is worse and there 's even more fud . 
   greece must give up the . 
  sovereignty and let more ** competent ** people run the contry for them !, 
  if eu is to be a cynical , anti-democratic , deceitful monstrosity ( as it has been when dealing with greece ) then it deserves to crash & burn . 
   the ez is probably less willing to set the precedent of giving into greece and then seeing similarly left-wing governments elected into spain who then do the same thing . 
  that is exactly why there would be a flight of capital . 
  everyone would fear that their country is next in line for exactly the reason you gave . 
  the eu politicians know this so they wo n't kick greece out . 
  of course the scary messages about a forced grexit if greeks vote no is a bluff meant to intimidate them into voting yes . 
  we should expect such repugnant lies from politicians who for years have been lying ( yes , lying , not mistaken ) to their electorates that austerity is the right medicine for greece . 
  anyone with half a brain could 've figured it out . 
  if greece were to exit the ez , the ez would fall like a house of cards because there would be a run on banks in the periphery countries . 
  the risk of this is higher and the consequences would actually be much more dire than , say , in 2010 because the economic situation is worse and there 's even more fud . 
  yes , through some clever financialization and deliberately not looking very closely at the ( very much insolvent ) greek banks , they were able to make it look as if things were looking up . 
  it was all bullshit , of course . 
  greece was as insolvent as ever , the debt was as unsustainable as ever and the austerity was as much a ponzi scheme as ever . 
  prepare for the best !, 
  funny but greece will not exit the ez in the case of debt restructuring . 
  it 's just a bluff to scare people into voting yes . 
   it 's staggering how aggressively arrogant he can be that he 's dictating terms to europe - threatening them , again , that if they do n't give a debt haircut then greece will commit an act of self harm that will damage everybody . 
  and that he thinks he can force the hand of every other european nation to go against their will and somehow at the end of it remain in an alliance of nations where he 's behaving like they are enemies . 
  i love that !, 
  serves the motherfuckers right for foisting for 5 years a bullshit austerity plan ( under false pretenses - they knew it would not produce the advertised results ! ), 
  upon a population that was not responsible for the crisis ( not just greeks - germans and other europeans too ) while the schmucks who were actually responsible got away scot-free . 
  i hope they 're shaking in their fucking boots . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  you 're either mathematically wrong or you do n't understand the definitions of the terms you 're using . 
  i mean , i could imagine being happy for your happiness about having been duped into recapitalizing an insolvent banking system ( with your tax money ) under the pretense of bailing out greece . 
  but it would be the kind of happiness that i feel for a shit-eater who 's happy that he 's eating shit . 
   so basically they are at the point where they were years ago , but everybody is pissed and the money has actually run out . 
  so , basically the same as in 2010 ( including no money and everyone being pissed ) . 
  only this time , greeks have the option to take a different path . 
  does n't matter . 
  internal demand is in the gutter . 
  investment is in the gutter . 
  for this reason , if there is significant capital in some private pockets , it is idle and will remain so . 
   if greece is to default and leave the euro ( and it is probably for the best ) , do it coolly , calmly , corageously and planned - and imo it would have been much better if done without all this drama and deadlines drama . 
  are you saying that syriza should not have tried negotiating first ? 
  because that 's where the drama is coming from . 
  if i were to vote , right now i 'd be leaning towards a no . 
  nope , 90 % those 300bn went to the insolvent banking system . 
  this money , for the most part , is not available as investment money for greece because banks do n't want to issue loans to greek companies . 
  domestic demand has been dropping like a rock due to falling wages . 
  it 's very naive to think of this situation as being solvable by great enterpreneurship and national spirit/character/work ethic . 
  are you greek ? 
  if i was , i would be stressing a lot about this referendum and would probably try to read up on the details of the issue as much as possible to make the best informed decision i can . 
  it 's not like varoufakis has been hiding his views on austerity . 
  you can guess the guy 's choice in this referendum within 5 minutes of watching any interview with him on the relevant subject , or by reading his blog . 
  the clip is from this event : * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf4xj9gs6bo ( keynote by varoufakis ) * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgyxnlkpx7q ( discussion but requires understanding of both english and german ), 
  not everyone can be a net exporter . 
  if one part of the world has a trade surplus , some other part of the world has to have a trade deficit . 
  greece has a trade deficit and this will not change . 
  given that fact , and the post-2008 situation ( low investment , low external demand ) , the prescriptions that worked for germany ( a surplus country and in a different global environment ) will not work for greece . 
  sure .
