  only catholic theocracy + a complete ban on all birth control & abortion can save white europe from its demographic decline and islamization . 
  ^ ( not an opinion i actually hold ), 
  not even polish catholic zealots would answer in the affirmative to that because it sounds too protestant or , even worse , jehovah 's - witnessy . 
  he started mincing words a bit since entering politics ( which does n't seem to be easy for him ) but [ ** watch him go in this interview ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=862njf9ktmg ) . 
  do n't you know ? 
  [ ** the southern darkies ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_race#nordicism ) have a poor work ethic . 
  that , rather than the major financial crisis that has injured the $ zone and exposed its architectural faults , is the reason why they 're suffering now . 
  the crisis persists for the whole eurozone . 
  it never went away , not just for greece . 
  a bunch of eurozone countries still struggle and will continue to struggle unless the architecture of the eurozone is changed , as varoufakis keeps saying . 
  unemployment rate for various countries we tend to hear about : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/unemployment-rate http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/unemployment-rate http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/unemployment-rate http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate expand the timeline of the graphs to at least 2007 to get a good , broad view . 
  feel free to check other indicators . 
  it wo n't fill you with optimism . 
  you are wrong . 
  even if greece was fiscally responsible , like spain ( ~ 35 % debt-to-gdp % in 2008 , compared to germany 's ~ 65 % ) , it would 've still crashed , only it would 've been the second or the third domino to fall ( again , like spain ) , not the first . 
  if you disagree , explain to me why shit hit the fan only after the 2008 financial crisis and the ponzi austerity measures . 
   varoufakis has never produced anything or made a business himself . 
  he is a football coach that has never played football . 
  this kind of argument i 've always found idiotic . 
  economics is not the same kind of profession as managing a business . 
  according to this logic , physicists should not lecture on maxwell 's equations because electrical engineers are the ones who actually build electric circuits . 
  understood but most of the reasons you list are the symptoms and/or results of the bigger problem varoufakis is talking about . 
  citizens of western eu , visit poland and other eastern countries for your vacation .

  if you deny it , that 's your choice . 
  just realize that you 're an idiot . 
  argentina would 've been far worse off by accepting imf 's bullshit , like greece did . 
  http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=67&amp;c=ar&amp;l=en http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=74&amp;c=ar&amp;l=en http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=66&amp;c=ar&amp;l=en oh , yeah , truly burnt to the ground . 
  there was a sharp shock and a quick recovery , unlike in greece where austerity is deepening and projecting into the future a crisis that is nowhere near subsiding . 
  but since you 're shifting the goal posts and instead of the health of the economy referring to the crime rate , here are the relevant stats : http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/156754/un-argentina-has-%e2%80%98europelike%e2%80%99-murder-rate - http://www.bubblear.com/why-crime-in-argentina-isnt-as-bad-as-you-think/, 
   i 'd imagine they would have focused on protecting all other economies while watching greece burn to the ground . 
  argentina did n't burn to the ground . 
   turns out countries do n't run so well when you do n't have any kind of money . 
  defaulting on a debt that a government owes to a private creditor does n't mean it ceases to have any money when it has tax revenues . 
  any more ignorance to share ? 
  the rest of your comment is gibberish without any semblance of sense . 
  the initial shock looks scary ( that 's why politicians are unwilling to take this course ) but it can rebound quite quickly . 
  better to take a strong , short shock than to pretend and deepen and project into the future a crisis that is nowhere near subsiding . 
  also , greece 's unemployment is nowhere near 70 % . 
  what would the european commission have done ? 
  kick greece out of the euro ? 
  for what ? 
  for actually being honest and instead of taking the largest taxpayer-backed loan in history ( and pretending to be capable of repaying that loan ) , restructuring its debt and partially defaulting on the debt owed to its private-sector creditors ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
   the problem is , austerity is n't just to `` pay debts '' . 
  it 's to reduces the deficits of a state that lived and still live above its means , and to borrow new money to do not too brutaly . 
  just look at greece 's debt-to-gdp . 
  austerity worsens the problem you 're talking about . 
  it 's austerity only in name , kinda like `` the ministry of truth '' . 
   if greece defaulted , it would still have needed to find money somewhere , and they would do so at much much higher interests rates . 
  i addressed this in my other comments . 
  90 % of the bailout money ( taken from european taxpayers and poor greeks ) went down the drain , into a black hole of an insolvent banking system . 
  it did not achieve anything . 
  it is a fallacy to think that if greece had defaulted , it would have had to have borrowed just as much , only under worse interest rates . 
   unless they have the pretention to brutally have no more deficits just after default , but to do so they would need cuts in depenses making the current austerity measures looks like a health promenade . 
  yes , the initial shock of defaulting would 've been more severe but a recovery would 've been possible and maybe even relatively quick , like in argentina . 
  i 'm not saying it would n't have been painful . 
  it would , initially , but the problem would not have haunted them for this long and this severely . 
  look carefully at what you 're saying . 
  every problem you 're pointing out under a default scenario is not alleviated but in fact magnified by the austerity . 
   the weight of the debt is far from being the only problem that greece 's economy face , and austerity is the measures taken against these problems . 
  now , deciding to take on ourselves , at least partly , the burden of greeks ' debt ( and in which measure we hold them responsible ) is another debate , one in which i must say that the human component does n't leave my idealist fiber indifferent . 
  greece is a symptom ( not a cause ) of a wider eurozone crisis that has very little to do with perceived frugality and responsibility of individual states . 
  spain had a very low debt-to-gdp o ~ 35 % in 2008 ( germany had ~ 65 % ) and still went into recession . 
  greece could 've been salvaged by a default but a real , lasting recovery can only happen through reforming the euro system . 
  the bailout should not have happened at all because it 's a debt that ca n't be serviced . 
   also , hope for recovery would have also existed when leaving the euro , however , at likely significantly less human damage than defaulting while maintaining the euro . 
  as varoufakis explains in the video i linked to , grexit would be far worse because greece does n't have a currency to devalue upon leaving the euro and it does n't have a ready export market . 
  all assets would be liquidated and taken out of the country in anticipation of the devaluation . 
  beyond that , the whole eurozone would crumble and that would essentially cause the next great depression . 
  and no , you ca n't sneakily introduce a new currency into the market without everyone noticing . 
   if they stayed in the euro they would either have to try and still get loans ( likely at interest rates that would have brought them right back to the problem they are in right now , assuming they would actually get any loans ) or they would have to basically let people starve in the streets whenever their money runs out . 
  90 % of the bailout money went straight to the insolvent banks on conditions of austerity . 
  it did not help the people . 
  it hurt and left people homeless because they 're the ones who had to shoulder a lot of the burden of bailing out the insolvent banks . 
  if greece had defaulted , whatever money they borrowed afterwards would 've been better spent . 
  yes , the initial shock of defaulting would 've been more severe but a recovery would 've been possible and maybe even relatively quick . 
  make no mistake , the current debt will be partially written off , one way or another . 
  it 's simply impossible for greece to repay it . 
  as long as there is economic activity , a government still gets revenue . 
  yes , they would have had to reduce govt . 
  expenses , just as with austerity , but at least : * they would 've been honest and ethical * they would 've done it on their own terms * the too-big-to-fail insolvent banks would not have held the economy hostage and gotten all this money from european taxpayers * there would 've been some hope for recovery . 
  with the current monstrous debt it is not physically possible to repay it , no matter how frugal , productive and austere greeks become . 
  the debt repayments alone are killing any efforts to reduce govt . 
  expenditures ( this is why greece 's govt . 
  expenses are not decreasing despite the titanic efforts to reduce them ) . 
   major financial crisis in europe ... 
  which has happened anyway and is deepened by austerity . 
   the only loans greece gets now have tremendous interest rates . 
  i 'm not saying it would n't have been painful . 
  it would , initially , but it would not have haunted them for this long and this severely . 
  at the very least troika would n't be gnawing on their balls so much . 
  and it would 've been more ethical . 
   greek debt has been raising sharply since 2008 because it \u00b4 s not reducing it \u00b4 s expenses ; and do you know why they are n't reducing their expenses ? 
  because of repayments on their loans ( loans which they should not have taken ) . 
  they have made a titanic ( pun ! ), 
  effort to reduce their expenses otherwise . 
  you 're a colossal ( pun ! ), 
  idiot .
