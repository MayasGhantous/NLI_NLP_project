  post this to / r/yurop instead . 
  this is silly . 
  no-one can prevent a government from defaulting if that government wants to do so . 
  no-one can force a government into accepting loans under conditions of austerity if that government does n't want to do so . 
  i do n't even know what your point is . 
  furthermore , defaulting would 've been the honest and ethical thing to do , rather than the current extend-and-pretend . 
  if greece had listened to varoufakis in 2010 , they would 've defaulted without leaving the euro . 
  a default in 2010 would 've prevented a lot of the human suffering that austerity has caused .

  * there is no such thing as the greek crisis ; greece is a symptom , not a cause of the wider euro crisis . 
  sure , greece may not have been in great shape before 2008 but no-one can deny that it would not have suffered this much if not for the euro and the austerity . 
  spain had a very low public debt of ~ 35 % before 2009 and still went into recession ( germany had ~ 65 % for comparison ) . 
  * krugman was in favor of greece 's default in 2010 and its exit from the euro . 
  varoufakis was in favor of greece 's default in 2010 but without grexit ( he made a blog post explaining why he disagrees with krugman about grexit ) . 
  both of them did n't want a single dollar of bailout from the rest of europe . 
  i would 've made a much more effortful and elaborate response if this post had n't been buried by the time i got around to writing my response . 
  no-one will read it now . 
  idiots would rather hear their preferred narrative of the austere , fiscally responsible germans and the spendthrift , lazy greeks . 
  every european should watch this lecture in its entirety : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meuwxnifjj8, 
  to me the most interesting part of the article is n't the one about the bird but the one about how the bird distracts the germans ( and the europeans in general ) from the incompetence of the politicians of the european commission who have not only imposed the disastrous austerity but , more importantly , are now refusing to admit their mistake and are still in power . 
  http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/disastrous-predictions-and-predictable-disasters/ the greek politicians who accepted the loans are of course also responsible , but at least they are not in power anymore . 
  yes . 
  read about the [ ** generalplan ost ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) and try to tell me with a straight face that this was the preferrable alternative to soviet rule . 
  read even a few paragraphs of that wikipedia article on generalplan ost and try to tell me with a straight face that these regimes were of similar magnitude of evil . 
   what are you saying ? 
  that i 'm driven by my emotions to be anti-soviet ? 
  if you 're trying to equalize both regimes in terms of evil then yes , absolutely . 
  the difference between them is not some triviality : it translated into the difference between life and death for tens , possibly hundreds of millions of people . 
  acknowledging that is important . 
   you 're right , but problem is most of crimes committed by ussr are not acknowledged . 
  both were evil and that 's the main point . 
  not equally evil . 
  i would even say that the soviets were ** far ** less evil overall and slightly less evil under stalinism . 
   did n't expect these words come from pole . 
  maybe because i 'm rational , i look at facts and do n't let emotions dictate my views ? 
  it makes it less bad . 
  killing ten people is not as bad as killing a thousand and executions and gulag decreased substantially after [ ** de-stalinization ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-stalinization#beginnings:_khrushchev.27s_speech ) thanks to khrushchev . 
  so the killing that was going on under soviet rule was mostly due to stalinism rather than some inherent ideological aspect of communism , unlike nazism which explicitly called for genocide on vast territories of europe . 
  to equalize these two regimes is grossly wrong and unfair to the soviets . 
  i mean , the soviets had almost fifty years to do something as bad as the nazis were in the process of doing and were planning to do during and after the war . 
  did they do it ? 
  did they do even a tenth of it ? 
  did they plan to do it ? 
  no to all three . 
  no , they did n't , [ ** not on the scale the nazis had planned ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) , not even close . 
  i would still call that a liberation . 
  the biggest violation of one 's liberty is to be killed without one 's consent , which is what the nazis wanted to do to the population of eastern europe . 
  what the soviets did was a liberation from death for large parts of europe , even though the regime they enforced in those parts was not pretty . 
  one ideology wanted us ( slavs , jews & some other minorities ) all exterminated , the other wanted us `` merely '' subjugated . 
  it 's obvious which one was less bad , unless you 're a far-right maniac who thinks europe would 've been better off had the nazis won ( i have seen such sentiment expressed , especially on youtube and in relation to greece ) . 
  question : if i omitted the insult and just called him a chauvinist and a demagogue , would i still have gotten this warning ? 
   yes they wanted to stay so they have to play by the rules . 
  the rules are such that there 's room for maneuver . 
  the latest mou is not some rigid and unchangeable dictat from god ; there 's nothing in the `` rules '' that necessitates punishing greeks in the way it does . 
  if you disagree , tell me how requiring greek businesses to prepay 100 % of next year 's taxes follows from the existing rules . 
  rhetorical question , i know you ca n't . 
  punishing greece punishes germany and other european countries too because it reduces greece 's ability to repay . 
  the latest deal is an obvious attempt to humilate the greek government . 
  its implementation gives greece no chance of recovery and , as usual , greeks will be blamed for failing to fulfill the impossible demands placed on them . 
  debt-to-gdp will again skyrocket ( which means calling it ` austerity ' is pretty orwellian ) and in the end no-one will benefit . 
   why should we trust greece with any money ? 
  we lost all trust in them after they faked their books . 
  now they have to regain that trust . 
  but you agree with sch\u00e4uble that restructuring their debt is not on the table ( because of `` rules '' ) so this has nothing to do with `` trust '' . 
  greece can either pay or leave the $ z , according to you . 
  the way the troika is `` handling '' greece guarantees that oligarchs will stay in power and the country 's structural problems will remain . 
   sorry but i have to report you now . 
  i do n't retract my statement . 
  you 've insulted an entire nation with your veiled and not-so-subtle chauvinist remarks , by painting greeks as shifty , tax-dodging , lazy . 
  all bullshit , debunked many times , as per oecd working hours statistics , etc. 
  you 're a fascist and a chauvinist . 
  greek governments did n't have a mandate for grexit . 
  the majority of greeks want to stay in the $ z. 
  in the case of syriza , their mandate was negotiation for a better deal from the next mou , so that 's what they did . 
  what they got in response was incredible hostility and harshness . 
   so why exactly is it a bad thing to give the money directly to the creditors which greece has to pay with the money anyway ? 
  there was an option to restructure the debt . 
  `` fortunately '' ( for the banksters and eu politicians ) , that 's no longer on the table , since pretty much all of the debt owed to private banks has been replaced with debt to official institutions and sch\u00e4uble made it abundantly clear that that wo n't be restructured . 
   yet the hard working , upstanding germans are helping them and all they get in return are backstabbing gestures like this one . 
  go suck a dick in hell with this crude demagoguery , you disgusting chauvinist . 
  greeks get no help , unlike banks . 
  that would be a purely symbolic gesture because most of that money has been written off by politicians responsible for the bailouts . 
  they knew well before the first bailout that most of it would never be repaid . 
  greece was never bailed out ( why would it otherwise need a new infusion of money every few years ? ) . 
  european banks were bailed out , courtesy of multiple taxpayer-funded handouts . 
  what happened to / r/europe is basically the same thing that happened to your mom . 
  she let too many people in and the quality dropped . 
  now / r/europe is a reactionary right-wing shithole . 
   why ca n't people just discuss things with a little less emotion ? 
  everything he says is suspect because he 's trying to put some energy into his delivery so as to not bore his viewers . 
  understood . 
   well yeah , every fucking kid knows they are cheating on the mpg , but they are also doing this on gasoline cars . 
  and i am pretty sure that your shitty electric car also does n't come close to what nissan promised you . 
  this is a minor part of the video and he addresses it . 
   every fucking kid  shitty all of these reddit comments are always so hard to read . 
  why ca n't people just discuss things with a little less emotion ? 
  [ ** this guy ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb3viorov6s ) had it right all along . 
   most redditors i come across that believe that the euro is entirely to blame for greece 's problems are anti-europeans looking for something to pin on the eu . 
  i became anti-eu because of the way troika handled the eurozone crisis in general and the greek crisis in particular .
