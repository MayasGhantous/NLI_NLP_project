  not to mention all those nuclear plants based on your own technology . 
  you guys have misunderstood . 
  i do n't have anything against the independence day itself , but it 's a day when [ polish independence march ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20292072 ) happens . 
  if you somehow missed it last year , it 's an yearly event organised by far-right organizations : [ all-polish youth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all-polish_youth ) , which probably have some people that actually think , albeit not too many , and especially [ national radical camp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_radical_camp_\\ ( 1993 \\ ) ) , which i hate with passion . 
  lots of normal people participate in the march . 
  i have good friends that go every years and there is certainly nothing wrong with them . 
  having said that , every fucking year the independence march results in violence . 
  far-rights , accompanied by ultras who just want to destroy something , fight with the police and very often devastate local property . 
  last year for example , they burned a rainbow symbolising lgbt society and attacked russian embassy , not too mention obligatory clashes with the police . 
  that 's also when i take a week-long break from tv and any news-related site on the internet . 
  that day i 'm very ashamed and pretend that this shit does n't happen .

  what about volleyball ? 
  your league used to be undoubtedly the best . 
  we have those too : [ s\u0142owi\u0144ski national park ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c5%82owi%c5%84ski_national_park ) with moving dunes . 
  truth . 
  source : i send this message to reddit by post . 
  while it does n't function as a common greeting in poland ( i would say it 's quite archaic ) everybody would understand what you mean . 
  another redditor from lublin who i know about !, 
  that makes 4 of us . 
  living the dream . 
   my goal for the next few years is to find a way to do the same thing . 
  by the way , are you familiar with [ this guy ] ( http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/the-year-without-english-2/ ) ? 
  he made a nice project that may interest you . 
  what do you do ? 
  if you do n't mind me asking . 
  honestly , it 's not that great . 
  the final exam after high school ( matura ) is the only thing they look at when you want to get into university . 
  which means that schools nowadays turn around standarized testing , as in your only goal is to score as high as possible on final exams and not to obtain knowledge . 
  emigration . 
  somehow i believed it ... [ oh fuck it ] ( http://www.snopes.com/politics/graphics/kickdoor.gif ) . 
  you have it easier than most of those countries though , so it 's only natural that your government would be held to the higher standard . 
  no one can deny church influence on european culture , it 's just just that the post was about paying reverence to the roots and i would say that most people are n't exactly happy about church overall contribution . 
  duda is n't anti-eu and he is n't even close to being the most conservative with guys like krauze and kowalski running up . 
  polish left in a nutshell , sadly . 
  it really is not . 
  most polish catholics are mildly religious and your average priest is n't anything extreme either . 
  i was going to church till i was 15 or 16 and never had i encountered , or even heard about , any bullying or anything coming from a priest . 
  at worst i had to argue about some rock band not propagating satanism . 
  on the contrary , i know some people that belong or did belong to some christian groups . 
  i 'm not a big fan of those myself , but they seem to be having genuine fun there . 
  i was at the wedding of the two people belonging to one of the [ more religious branches of the scouts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scouting_association_of_the_republic_\\ ( poland \\ ) ) . 
  i encountered three priests there , they were dancing , joking around and doing anything you would expect from someone at the wedding . 
  maybe it 's about time to get past your angry atheist phase ? 
  i did and i do n't regret it . 
  unless you went through all of this yourself , then i ca n't blame you . 
  i was talking about a degree that does n't depend on it , on a lower tier , but not entirely shit politechnika . 
  that 's why i thought it could be a good representative of average . 
  well , some of those people that i listed in lower groups would probably be able to clear b1 . 
  matura is on b1 , and it 's a joke . 
  i just do n't feel that this translates to being able to make a conversation, 
  yeah , but that 's silesian uni of technology . 
  i 'm sure that uw , agh and so are the same . 
  i was talking about my in every aspect * average * politechnika lubelska . 
  the case i 'm making is , for every uw , you have 2 pl 's , and some shitty private universities . 
  and that 's only educated people . 
  it 's weird , as far as i know poland has a lot more than three . 
  [ here is the list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_world_heritage_sites_of_poland ) . 
  you would think that the official site of unesco would get it right . 
  as much as i hate to say this , the people you met probably were n't good representatives of the group as a whole . 
  i never said that we were terrible , in fact , we 're a lot better than italians or spanish and many others . 
  it 's just that we 're not quite there yet . 
  i can give you a quick breakdown of proficiency levels of my peers , or at least how i perceive them . 
  so you have a group of 150 people aged 21 and pursuing engineering degree on an average polish university . 
  they aim for higher education in the field that does n't really require proficiency in foreign language . 
  a pretty good representative of average educated young people in poland . 
  out of those 150 , there are like 10 people with whom you would be able to discuss an abstract topic . 
  they would talk in more or less correct way , occasionally making some grammar mistakes . 
  i 'm at the top of this group and yet my english is still far from perfect . 
  next 30 would be able to get their message across and should be able to keep the conversation more or less flowing . 
  they would make many mistakes , but once they overcome their fear of speaking you would be able to talk about stuff like work in a an acceptable manner . 
  another 40 or so would probably be able to give you directions , but an interesting conversation would be out of the question . 
  the rest may be able to introduce themselves and say that they like ice cream , but that 's about it . 
  you would have to gesture a lot , to put it mildly . 
  and then there are those who struggled with english even in an elementary school . 
  and there is a good chance that someone older than 45 would n't speak any english at all . 
  so , as i said in the beginning , we 're getting somewhere , but we 're not quite there . 
  i agree . 
  poland is n't even in the same league as the netherlands and nordics , as this survey would suggest . 
  currently reading * the short history of nearly everything * and i absolutely love it . 
  he is really a great writer and i 'm going to read the shit out of his other books . 
  really great read , even if not entirely accurate . 
  it depends on the version ... 
  i really liked the story , but reading the full version was really tough sometimes . 
  50 pages of the action and then 50 pages describing the monastery . 
  and i 'm not even joking . 
  raymond chandler was the man . 
  i especially liked `` the long sleep '' so make sure that you read it !, 
  you have to realize that shitty economy of spain or italy is still better than polish at it 's best . 
  / r/europe makes it sound as if those two countries were some shitholes . 
  they may be falling further from the elite , but i assure you that they are still better off than any country of the former eastern block . 
  i considered the unemployment , but pros still outweigh the cons . 
  this survey does n't correlate with suicide rates either .
