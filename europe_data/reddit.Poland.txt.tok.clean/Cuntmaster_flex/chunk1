here 's a [ rap song ] ( http://youtu.be/aowh0w6t6em ) in saami !, 
  putin makes me fucking sick . 
  rejoicings !, 
  you should ad wroc\u0142aw to the prague-warsaw line . 
  wroc\u0142aw is awesome :d, 
  german , soulmates in austria and czech republic . 
  cool :d, 
  like train !, 
  who says they 're catholic ? 
  yup , can confirm . 
  [ happy independence !,

  came here to say this , poverty has a part in this for sure . 
  the germans go to hungary and poland , 
  yep , all this could be explained if you stepped in our shoes . 
  also , its in human nature too feel better than those less fortunate . 
  i second vienna , so much culture !, 
  is n't this kinda like the plot of call of duty : modern warfare 2 ? 
  i mean specifically attacks against muslims *, 
   with time well it never used to be like this . 
  the migrant crisis and isis constantly in the news has got people really closed minded at the moment . 
  the perceived threat russia poses has also triggered a renewed nationalism and a `` banding together to defend the country '' sentiment . 
  just my opinion though . 
  not fascism but nationalizm and as a result racism and xenophobia . 
  with time it 'll die down . 
  teenage pregancies are n't the solution to a country 's low birth rate . 
  i do n't understand why they have to be `` smuggled '' . 
  ca n't they just legally apply for assylum while still in turkey ? 
  can someone explain this to me ? 
  fuck this , moving to greenland . 
  [ my life it 's potato . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kksplpfb5bi ), 
  to be honest , i did n't really like zadar . 
  i recommend rovinj or or any other small costal city if you want to hit the beach . 
  ever watch dead snow ? 
  dont forget schindler 's factory museum !, 
  you can thank the architect , \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0420\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432 !, 
  i am soooo sorry you guys . 
  probably norway !, 
  well then explain why suddenly all the refugee complexes in german seem to be excedingly flamable recently . 
  what the fuck, 
  almost impossible to get anything for cheaper in the main cities . 
  maybe theres differences between cities ? 
  a resident doctor starting in wroc\u0142aw makes 2200pln ( ~ 500eur ) and i as a sta\u017cysta ( intern ) only make around 415eur with overtime . 
  this is a great point , but even relatively speaking 2000pln/month doesnt go far when your rent is 1200pln . 
  a resident doctor gets paid ~ 500 $ a month , and a paramedic gets around 300 $ a month . 
  [ i made a then vs. now comparison of wroclaw ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lhpjh ), 
  tsk !, 
  we may never catch up !, 
  i think they set the bar at gdp per capita 15.000 usd , in which case all those countries are still under that threshold . 
  that 's why we 're not having children in europe :o, 
  think of the lecs\u00f3 !, 
  i was not aware :d, 
  my grandma lives in a polish village and she as well as many others still burn coal to heat their appartments - . -, 
  well , i never said they were n't people , they just also happen to be scum as well . 
  so you 're pro childhood marriage , criminal rackets , violence and rape ? 
  is that a problem ? 
  nailed it . 
  the question was to draw north america . 
  why would you forsake your fellow commonwealth nation ? 
  and also mexico . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.com/attractions-g274856-activities-warsaw_mazovia_province_central_poland.html ) you go !, 
  mmmm all dat coastline !, 
  we have no doctors because who wants to work for 500-600 $ when you can work in any other eu country . 
  death harvest , now thats a good band name . 
  that 's [ transnistria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria ) , a pro-russian seperatist region . 
  [ heres ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo.jpg ) it now !, 
  can confirm , am humiliated . 
  that 's actually the newest and most advanced hospital in the whole lower silesian state , believe it or not . 
  hide the children . 
  no torre argentina ? 
  be right back , gaining superpowers . 
  i need to visit this city soon . 
  naaajs, 
  exactly my point :d it 's just asking to get surrounded, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/0cxcrxtaetg?t=52 ), 
  that must have been a fun town to defend against an attacking army . 
  look out !, 
  daddy 's home !, 
  this picture is a few years old , that cathedral has since been restored and it looks [ a lot nicer ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ykavga_uqgm/ugknyf18lqi/aaaaaaaaagi/pqu6g5alxwa/s1600/img_2374.jpg ) now . 
  germoney ? 
  is that you ? 
  i feel like every citizen in that town owns a boat . 
  the young ones rent appartments . 
  older resudents usually work 1-2 extra jobs - evenings in a walk-in clinic or as an ambulance doctor . 
  til resident doctors make minimum wage in poland . 
  ~ 460 $ / month, 
  warsaw : 280z\u0142 for a 90-day pass x 4 = 1120z\u0142 ( $ 260 ) for a year . 
  krak\u00f3w : 94z\u0142 for a 30-day pass x 12 = 1128z\u0142 ( $ 262 ) for a year . 
  wroc\u0142aw : 240z\u0142 for a 90-day pass x 4 = 960z\u0142 ( $ 222 ) for a year . 
  it went from almost none to ukranians working most convenience store and low-paying jobs . 
  very noticeable change since the start of the conflict in eastern ukraine . 
  the westest !, 
  i always like seeing that at least we 're comparable to portugal . 
  actually , it ' pretty big in poland . 
  blew up more than anyone expected . 
  this is a goddam masterpiece page . 
  and then you realize , part of canada is about the same level as northern italy . 
  so which one is your house in this picture ?
