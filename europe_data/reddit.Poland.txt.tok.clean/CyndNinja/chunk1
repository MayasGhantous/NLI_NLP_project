our last president , his wife and 94 other people would also like to discourage anyone from buying russian aircrafts as well . 
  and flying to russia . 
  and getting into any interaction with any kind of russian birches . 
  why do n't they just abandon these terrains ? 
  this war is basically waste of money , time and people for two provinces , which declared independence . 
  get into eu , get richer than them , and they gon na want to come back themselves . 
  wait , what 's wrong with herrings and jelly ? 
  estonia and latvia are inflants for us anyway . 
  upper silesia ( including silesians and often former borderlanders living there as well ) and warsaw ( usually including whole masovia ) hate each other . 
  first of all , after ww2 fresh communist government took away silesian autonomy . 
  then as silasian culture was influences by germany they decided to try kill it by moving more non-silesian to dilute silesian culture ^ stealing ^ their ^ jobs ^ as ^ side ^ effect - diluting the culture of borderlanders to were just moved to western parts of konurbation . 
  of course government = warsaw , so it ' warsaw to blame . 
  then silesian hate warsaw for being too proud as `` capital dwellers '' , while if you count silesian metropolis as one entity its is bigger than warsaw metropolitan area ( of course warsawians hate this fact ) . 
  this also applies to all masiovians who count them as warsawians , cause they are `` close enough '' . 
  then silesians want silesian to be recognised as language , while warsaw still classifies it as a dialect . 
  both regions are relatively way more catholic than pomerania and lower silesia , and just a bit less than mountain regions . 
  warsaw catholics find silesian catholics fake as they link god with industry and progress , while silesian catholics find warsaw catholics way too radical - since group of people would n't even let the cross near president 's palace ( which was put there after smolensk catastrophe ) be brought back to the church , cause `` they wo n't let anyone take the cross away '' . 
  they agree only on the fact that eastern provinces ( aka poland b ) take their money ( though silesia blames warsaw for that anyway ) . 
  oh , and cracow ( former capital ) likes to rival with warsaw as well . 
  you do n't understand how propaganda works - it is not `` lying '' . 
  propaganda is providing you with part of information , which is meant to change your opinion on some topic due to it 's incompleteness . 
  it does not mean it has to be lie . 
  you see , when communists said that the n-year plan was completed in 140 % it may well be true - you either are n't provided with information how much those planned `` 100 % '' was to begin with or you are provided with some numbers which mean nothing to you due to lack of comparison . 
  planning less and overdoing it is the same as planning more and failing to fulfil if you do just as much work . 
  however , when you are reporting it , the saying that you did `` 100 of planned 10 '' sound much better than `` 100 of planned 1000 '' . 
  and if you want to put someone in bad light you just have to do the the opposite . 
  you do n't need to lie to manipulate others ' opinions . 
   there are n't widespread , racially motivated crimes against illegal immigrants ** who ** told you that crimes against illegal immigrants are ** widespread ** in russia ? 
  as you wrote yourself crime rate in russia is ** really ** high . 
  in russia being attacked in back alley is ** usual ** thing . 
  these are just cases . 
  and you just based you opinion on some video posted on reddit that shows these `` cases '' . 
  oh and `` i 'm pretty sure you 've never been to '' eastern europe `` if you are making these claims . '', 
   in fact the us has more tolerant views than the majority of europe , according to two swedish economists . 
  no one would even try to argue with that . 
  europe is racist and we know it . 
  i was n't implying that you treat illegal immigrants worse than americans , i was implying that they do n't necessary live in well-equipped , sanitary flats and have good jobs . 
  it was n't about being mexican , black , white , muslim or green alien , it was about being illegal immigrant with no possibilities . 
  video makes you think that these people live in such environment because they are black . 
  they live these way because they are n't even allowed to live there . 
   go take a shower at your boyfriends ' places !, 
  does that mean you dorms are n't coeducational ? 
  damn , that 's bourgeoisie . 
  where to start : they have place to sleep , kitchen , bathroom , they have netbooks , tablets , smart phones and internet . 
  they still live better lives than most of eastern european , yes , even inside eu , jobless people or poorer students . 
  and it 's not like they ca n't find a job and rent some flat , what should n't be a big expense in comparison to west eu locations . 
  racism ? 
  it 's not germany or france , where every fourth person is foreigner , former eastern block is n't a place where your usual emigrants go , it 's almost like a white monolith . 
  also if he was attacked by `` skinheads '' ( i doubt there are actual skinheads in place where there are so few blacks - they are most likely just usual thugs ) it means he was n't wary enough . 
  then there clinged to some nationalistic group . 
  it 's not like they would prepare actual attack on racist basis . 
  it 's not kkk . 
  some thugs needed a reason to beat someone so they did it in name of russian nationalisms , just like americans needed reason to attack iraq so they did it in name of democracy . 
  finally , they are illegal immigrants . 
  it 's not like any country is obliqued to help them . 
  and it 's not like usa is much better - you wo n't get away with attacking someone , but there is much higher probability of getting shot by random mad people . 
  and do you think us standards of living are much better for illegal immigrants from mexico ? 
  i 'd recommend reading [ `` marzi '' ] ( http://www.vertigocomics.com/graphic-novels/marzi ) graphical novel . 
  however it 'll be probably hard to find it anywhere . 
  who would care about words used , when the context is wrong on so many levels ? 
   at least europeans are no japaneses i guess . 
  that means in japan , after my hrt , when i try to wear furisodes houmongis or female yukatas in front of japanese , as an arch nemesis korean origin , japanese will silently treat me as freak comedian/monster ( ab0m1n4710n perhaps ) / weirdo/rebel , treasonous one who breaks the society 's stability and will make me stick to nichome and work there only as bar worker or comedian ... europeans will never act and think like that even if i wear most ornate european costumes in major cities i guess ? 
  it always amused me how koreans and japanese hate each other way more than how poles and russians do . 
  come to think of it i should 've started from szlachta dress , which were more or less uniform across the whole commonwealth . 
  ^ even ^ though ^ no ^ one ^ wears ^ them ^ ^ anymore , ^ ^ anywhere . 
  poland : as for national costumes each historical region has their own : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_costumes_of_poland http://www.polskiinternet.com/english/info/folk-costiums.html however , unfortunately for you male costumes are usually the more recognised ones ( aside from \u0141owicz - dem rainbows ) while female clothing is usually just more or less colourful dress with flower motifs . 
  edit : of course , given the amount of different costumes the ones commonly recognised are usually only \u0141owicz , highland , cracow , kashubian ( by jackets and hats ) , upper silasian ( by jackets and scarfs ) , poznan ( by shirts and hats ) and maybe lublin ( by hats ) . 
  also , costume is treated as a sign of your origin , so foreigner in national costume would look really weird . 
  moreover , maybe aside from some highlanders/g \u00f3rals ( which usually do it to promote region , aka earn money for ` photos with highlanders ' ) no one really wears national costumes on daily basis or any non-folk events . 
  overall the usual suit ( garnitur/garsonka ) is for work and casual clothes outside work . 
  dress for females is a thing for elegant parties and for them only . 
  this will be probably just as effective as bans for minors on alcohol , tobacco or porn . 
  read : `` they wo n't drink them at school and public places . 
  at least not in plain sight . '', 
  inb4 lithuanian teens drinking energy drinks from lemonade bottles and thermoses . 
  hey look at bright sides , at least they did it democratic way like a civilised country . 
  / s ( or rather irony ? 
  they do n't call them nazi due to godwin 's law . 
  they just went to school in the morning and worked in the afternoon or the other way around . 
  yeah , that 's the case for slovak , but on the other hand czech is way harder to understand in speech . 
  maybe it 's cause of their weird accent ? 
  * wroc\u0142aw will always be a silesian city * ps : i 'm not even silesian , lol . 
  [ too lazy to draw basques borders , but i like you too ] ( http://s14.postimg.org/za9ptbfzl/porandstronk.png ), 
  [ come on , last time was n't even a century ago . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ), 
  sounds more like ikigami . 
  [ it 's actually still pretty popular in europe ] ( http://chartsbin.com/view/1887 ) poland and serbia abolished it just 4 years ago , germany only supended it 3 years ago . 
  also funny thing how there are so many countries with military draft in americas even though no real danger of war exists there . 
  well , slavic mythologies usually personified all supernatural being ( at very best giving them several heads ) so only normal ` monster ' would be [ wawel dragon ( `` smok wawelski '' , read `` smock vavelsky '' ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wawel_dragon ) aside from him , we have : [ rusa\u0142kas / rusa\u0142ki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rusalka ) ( read rooh-sahw-kee ; rusa\u0142ka ( read rooh-sahw-ka ) in singular ) , which you probably know as rusalkas from russian mythology . 
  i do n't really get why they are translated as [ `` wi\u0142as '' / `` wi\u0142y '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supernatural_beings_in_slavic_folklore#vila ) ( read veewi ; `` wi\u0142a '' ( read veewa ) in singular ) which are completely different spirits originating from west and south slavic pagans . 
  the main difference is wi\u0142as being air spirits , while rusa\u0142kas are water ones . 
  the latter may be known to you probably as veelas as they appeared in harry potter . 
  [ the treasure/skarbnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karze%c5%82ek ) ( read scar-bneeck , though you probably got it right anyway ) which/who is my personal favourite , since it 's actually a pretty nice guy . 
  also i never heard the name `` karze\u0142ek '' , which wikipedia uses especially since i always imagined him as at least averagely tall . 
  [ strzygas/strzygi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strzyga ) ( read stshee-gee , strzyga ( stshee-ga ) in singular ) - the main problem with these is that the only characteristic thing about them is double set of teeth , so it 's a bit hard to imagine them : / i think we can just suppose they are something similar to banshees . 
  [ baba jaga aka baba yaga ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baba_yaga ) - she 's in pretty much in every eastern folklore , you should at least heard of her ? 
  [ topielec , topek , sometimes wodnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/topielec ) ( read toh-pye-lets , toh-pehk , vodnik respectively , all singular cause i 'm unsure myself how plurals would sound for any of these names , wiki says it 's `` topielce '' for the first one ) - evil spirit living in water , first two names translate to `` drown man '' the last one is basically grouping them together with [ other evil water spirits of similar traits ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vodyanoy ) . 
  [ czart , czort ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chort ) ( read chart/chort ) - basically devils in slavic folklore . 
   western pomerania i think you should look at the map posted above . 
  also most of these 90 % are people who do n't want to become atheist because they still want to hold easter and christmas as in polish tradition or to take christian marriage .
