  also they are usually passive catholics aka `` believing not practicing '' . 
  well , srsly what 's the point of apostasy , it would be just limiting yourself . 
  it 's something like buddhism and shinto in japan , they are usually practically atheists but still consider themselves theists for sake of traditional holidays . 
  as for 40 % statistics , as a church goer comparing usual to 1st day of christmas ( pasterka included ) or great saturday i 'd say they are pretty accurate . 
  at least in upper silesia . 
  [ from wikipedia , % of people claiming to `` believe in god '' . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/europe_belief_in_god.svg/800px-europe_belief_in_god.svg.png ), 
  i think in poland people outside warsaw would be actually even less respecting to politicians than warsaw people , who tend to be personalized with government themselves by everyone else . 
  for example , the hate for warsaw in silesia comes in a large extent from the fact how the government has treated them ( taking away silesia 's autonomy , trying to suppress the local culture ) . 
  also , in poland everyone hates politicians . 
  complaints on the government in one of most common things you can hear when talking with average pole . 
  to be more precise : there are daily studies and extramural studies in public univesities . 
  daily studies are free ( aside for living expenses of course ) , but it 's hard to get accepted for most popular fields ( such as law , medicine or computer technology ) . 
  you still have to pay if you repeat a year , though . 
  last year you could n't study 2 free courses at the same time , but from what i heard they changed it back or will change it back in nearest future . 
  extramural studies are not founded by country , and are taken usually by those who failed to get to daily ones or have job preventing them from studying in week . 
  private schools , aside from one mentioned already by reverse_sausage , are considered weak and learning in them is often considered as `` buying the diploma '' cause exams are often way easier than in in public ones . 
  also i think the exact same thing goes for at least slovakia ( judging from comments below ) and probably other eastern countries as well , so the map should include some more asterisks or something . 
  also some countries with similar systems are marked blue . 
  movement of east-west line in europe : 1945 - goes through the middle of germany . 
  1990 - goes along the eastern border of germany . 
  2004 - goes along the eastern border of poland . 
  2014 - goes through the middle of ukraine . 
  [ my comment from a little above . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2grg1j/population_density_in_europe/ckm60z5 ) it translates as `` white russia '' because `` belarus '' actually means `` white russia '' . 
  the question should be about why it is n't translated in english . 
  it 's `` white russia '' , which is actually one of very few names of slavic countries translated properly in a western . 
  belarus is literally something like `` whiterussia '' in belarussian , and so it is translated in slavic languages . 
  also some trivia : `` russia '' in most slavic languages ( russian included ) is pronounced with ` o ' instead of ` u ' to differentiate it from rus as a region . 
  `` ukraine '' means `` borderlands '' or more literally `` countryedge '' `` montenegro '' means `` black mountain '' in latin and is translated as `` black mountain '' or sometimes something like `` blackmountain '' in slavic languages . 
  poland 's full name in polish is `` rzeczpospolita polska '' which means `` commonwealth of poland '' ( or , more literally , `` polish commonwealth '' ) - it is translated as `` republic '' just to avoid confusion as it is no longer a federation . 
  also , `` polska '' which is usually the name of poland in most slavic languages is actually not a noun but an adjective ( `` polish '' ) used as noun ( yes , same goes for - ski and - cki names , they 're adjectives ) . 
  finally , `` pole '' means `` field '' .

  you just put another extra 0 there ... 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_europe so ... who 's next ? 
  while we had to learn every european country location and capital by heart back in middle school ... not to mention high school ... . _ . 
  ( of course , not that there are many people who did it and still remember , duh ), 
  in local languages . 
  nice one . 
  on side note montenegro is crna gora ( `` the black mountain '' ) in montenegrin . 
  and similarly in any other slavic language . 
  the rest of the world adapted latin version for some reason , probably because it was the language they used to talk with local rulers , while slavic people would understand montenegrin and just call it `` black montain '' . 
  also , continuing the mistake seeking : georgia is `` sakartvelo '' in georgian . 
  but no one in the west would probably know that . 
  sorry , georgians . 
  n. brat g. brata d. bratu a. brata i. bratem l. bracie v. bracie there is no `` bratowi '' form . 
  you forgot to add that you also need to speak fast like a burning frenchman . 
  `` jak u nas '' quite similar to polish, 
  well , poland also writes v as w. 
  both polish \u00f3 and english oo evolved from long o sound , though . 
  well , in western poland , a lot of people still consider silesia and pomerania `` conquered germany '' .

  nice try , ukip . 
   nobility which consisted of a very small portion of a population in whole big region 1 . 
  nobility in commonwealth was about 10 % of population , highest percentage in europe , comparable only to spain . 
  big cities had higher percentage of nobility than countryside . 
  cities are generally more educated , so they had naturally lower chances of speaking more `` rural '' belarusian over polish and russian . 
  of course , people would want to study the same language nobles did , which was polish . 
  no , i think he just did n't get the republic part . 
  it 's not that hard considering amount of poles claiming that vilnius is polish city , because polonised lithuanians live there . 
  it was called `` lithuania '' after lithuania conquered it . 
  before it was kievan rus ' or , in polish , ru\u015b kijowska . 
  ruthenia is english-only term for parts of rus ' not belonging to russia aka former kievan rus ' lands . 
  if you think a term should not be used when referring to history before it was created , just read it as ru\u015b in my post . 
  also i wonder how would you call pre-1507 america , as the term was n't used before that year . 
  actually it 's not the same . 
  yes , both baltic lithuania and slavic macedonia were near capital and are named after bigger states that were actually speaking other official language ( ruthenian or greek ) . 
  however , the conquest of macedonian lands started from greek speaking part , which conquered slavs ( and half of middle east ) , but the conquest of lithuanian lands started from the baltic part which conquered ruthenia . 
  so saying that baltic lithuania is n't true lithuania , because ruthenia hold most of power in grand duchy is the same as saying that greater poland is n't not true poland , as lesser poland and masovia were holding most of the power in the crown . 
  do n't worry , most of mainland poles are n't very fond of russia-loving borderlanders anyway . 
  [ random polish video i found on yt made in lithuania . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmbcw0mi_ci ) [ another one . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weofk4wtxuu ) everyone is understandable , but every person below 20 is indeed speaking with eastern slavic accent . 
  also , yay for pre-war \u0141 's . 
  [ this video on the other hand , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqtuexowftu ) is on the point that i 'm not sure if people on the street are speaking polish or some polish vocabulary version of belarusian . 
  the journalists also have a bit of accent ( and \u0141 's ) but generally sounds alright . 
  [ these kids and old guy , ( scene before the play , play itself is in some french-german ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ovp9gkqiii ) are hardly understandable at all . 
  i would n't say it is very far from school system in poland . 
  the main exceptions would be : - poles choose subjects , on basic or extended level , they want to take on exam based on what they want to study later , and they have to take only 3 exams : basic polish , basic maths and basic foreign language and pass on 30 % . 
  so for example when you want to study it , you can take extended maths , physics or it , and pass basic maths , polish and english at 30 % . 
  then the uni will check how you did on basic maths and extension of your choice . 
  if you want to study medicine , you would go with both ext. 
  biology and ext. 
  chemistry , which most medical unis require . 
  if you want to study something easy like sociology , you should generally be fine with passing just basic-level exams . 
  - most of the material and less important subjects are realized in 1st and 2nd year of high school , so in 3rd year teachers can focus more on national exams still , our system is considered one of the best . 
  also , afternoon supplementary classes are standard thing around the world . 
  here we call them `` korepetycje '' or `` korki '' fro short ( yes , that 's cork pun for no reason ) . 
  i 'll put this this way : recently someone threw a pig head into a newly build mosque in warsaw . 
  now when you read comments under the news on more right-wing oriented sites , they 'll , of course , tell that was right thing to do . 
  meanwhile on left-wing oriented sites , comments argue that it offends polish muslims and tatars , and they should 've thrown pork at migrants themselves instead . 
  you get the idea . 
  you ... forgot '' / s '' ? 
  we are central , but people often call us eastern due to us being post-communist . 
  and we hate that .
