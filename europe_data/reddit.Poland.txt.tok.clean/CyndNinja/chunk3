   it 's really hard ( read almost impossible ) to have multiple languages in google search too [ you can choose up to 8 . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/szki4ry ) of course , english sites will be found most often , as they are too common and they usually have both highest number of views and information . 
  do n't worry , we actually prefer being called `` asians '' than `` eastern europeans '' . 
  it would be better if it allowed multiple regions simultaneously . 
  i 'd want to have results in english , both uk and american , polish , german , japanese ... 
  i do n't want to be forced to pick just one .

  man , we have people wanting to delegalise homosexuality and in vitro , cross defenders before presidential palace , least liberal abortion laws in europe after ireland , and 90 % catholic population with 40 % of them ( excluding small children , elderly and disabled ) on masses every sunday . 
  oh and sex ed is still optional subject at school . 
  it 's almost as bad here as in america . 
  but then the sister would be like ... 12 years old . 
  ok , i 'll go all in with comparisons to other languages . 
  portuguese - like english version of french . 
  nasal vowels sound familiar to polish ones spanish - more aggressive ( if romance language can even sound aggressive ) version of portuguese catalan - despite supposedly being mix of spanish and french , for me it sounds extremely similar to italian french - very pleasant to listen , very poetic , accent is too characteristic to compare it to anything else italian - vowel system and basic accent are very similar to polish , extremely melodic and powerful romanian - russian version of italian moldavian - more russian version of romanian german - quite similar to polish ( probably because i live in silesia , where polish is more similar to german than anywhere else ) , however more powerful and opera-like , albeit less poetic dutch - i does n't really sound as similarly to german as one would expect , more pleasant and relaxing english - russian version of french ( sorry , i just had to write it ) icelandic - like english but neither russian nor french norwegian - extremely calm compared to other germanic languages danish - as / u/synsc wrote , drunk version of norwegian , they talk like no one cares what they 're saying anyway swedish - due to tone system it sounds a bit south slavic , like croatian among the germanic languages finnish - sounds like japanese , but more calmer and without soft consonants saami - more melodic version of finnish estonian - russian version of finnish hungarian - it does n't rally sound very similar to finnish or estonian , more like some land-locked pirates irish - like hungarian but less pirate-like , still i do n't understand a word slovenian - it sounds way too much like italian croatian - very similar to slovak , although i do n't understand a shit serbian - it actually does sound a bit different than croatian bosnian - it actually does n't sound any different from croatian montenegrin - it actually does n't sound any different from serbian bulgarian - least understandable among slavic languages from polish perspective macedonian - i wonder how many people i could annoy by writing anything here russian - it sound to me is the way i think english would sound to french people , it is more powerful and melodic , but less rhythmic or poetic ukrainian - russian version of polish belarusian - also russian version of polish , but more polish words and sounds rusyn - also russian version of polish , but with even more polish words eastern polish - also russian version of polish , but without russian words silesian - german version of polish podhalan - slovak version of polish kashubian - how is this even supposed to be similar to polish , i understand slovak and belarusian better than this czech - someone explain , how the hell they got this weird accent ? 
  poles can not understand what czechs say , even though they understand words slovak - like czech , but sounds more polish , even though it has a little bit less similar words lithuanian - russian version of latin latvian - like lithuanian but neither russian nor latin ( wait , i think i already used this line before ) greek - sounds ... greek ? 
  i 'm seriously unable to compare it to anything , however unlike french it does n't really seem characteristic in any particular way albanian - has a bit greek ring to to it but far from enough to mistake them , a bit more relaxed basque - generally similar to spanish , just the words make no sense, 
  oh , c'mon , at least it 's not `` wlodarski '' . 
  why would he need one anyway ? 
  but it 's all because austria stole ours first !, 
  tl ; dr : we took the colors of the crest and then spent too much time wondering what they should represent . 
  ukrainian has practically the same grammar , so it 's just learning words anyway . 
  i wonder if this the reason why bagpipes are called ` dudy ' in polish . 
  [ form you get to fill in order to log in , if your name has been reported as invalid twice . 
  no idea why they are mismatched but it seems to be general trend all over the poland , not only krak\u00f3w . 
  i 'd assume it 's kind of local style , maybe ? 
  as a citizen of silesia , i do n't care what they put on the map , but i also like how they omitted warsaw . 
   haydar alma , 42 , who owns a nearby polish shop not that i 'm surprised with things like the fact that most of sushi bars here are owned by ukrainians/russians/people with eastern slavic accent , but c'mon i thought england should have enough poles to own all the polish shops there . _ . 
  they already have no feet to shoot themselves at anyway . 
   northern poland * western, 
   ukrainians ( and belarusians but it 's harder for them ) i 'd say that belarusians are more liked than ukrainians as long as they do n't speak russian . 
  well , at least in the areas with former galician/volhynian families . 
  we are better : in informal polish `` no '' actually means `` yes '' . 
  ( it 's short for `` ano '' ) . 
  it 's pronounced with short ` o ' , though .

  & nbsp ; edit : formatting, 
  but pigs are more cute than goats : <, 
  serbians does n't have this problem though . 
  putting aside the fact that they usually use their own keyboard anyway , in serbian you do n't have more than two versions of the same letter , so you can just make it right alt + letter . 
  alt + c = \u0107 ) the problem arises when you have three letter based on the same latin one . 
  polish has this problem with \u017c an \u017a , but since \u017a is used really rarely , we just made it alt + x. 
  however \u0161 and \u015b are way more common , and they have also \u010d and \u0107 on top of that . 
  @ 3 well , not really . 
  polish rules on example of soft s : \u015b - when not followed by vowel sia , si\u0105 , sie , si\u0119 , sio , si\u00f3 , siu - ` i ' is mute , s is soft si - s is soft sja , sj\u0105 , sje , sj\u0119 , sji , sjo , ( sj\u00f3 , ) sju - s is not soft , j is pronounced sija , sij\u0105 , sije , sij\u0119 , sijo , ( sij\u00f3 , ) siju - this way both s is soft and i pronounced before vowel . 
  same for \u017a and \u0107 \u0144 is more complicated in last two cases as it is still followed by i ( eventually double i ) , but never mind it , as this rule is pointless anyway other soft sounds are considered allophones with their basic sounds in polish , but they 'd be probably used similarly to s , z , c, 
  north slavic languages , sans russian and spoken polish make difference between ch and h sound - former is unvoiced , latter is voiced . 
  there are some , also lack of letter does n't look as weird as presence of an unknown letter . 
  transliterating x as x rather than ch hurts my polish eyes . 
  what kind of keyboard would ukrainians use to write this ? 
  cause it seems to be extremely annoying system to write on english qwerty , as you have \u0161 and \u015b , a well as \u010d and \u0107 , so one of each pair would be bind to weird key . 
  is n't it better to standardise to either apostrophes or accents for soft signs rather than using both depending on letter ? 
   other people are not going to understand ukrainian in latin or cyrillic as a polish i disagree . 
  it does n't feel like polish at all , too many '' s and v 's, 
  well , germany started war if you take the standard , polish-english-french point of view . 
  from romanian point of view , it 's ussr who attacked first , just like for americans war started with pearl harbour attack . 
  i think i should precise my question then : how fucked you are if you fail this one ? 
  is this obligatory or optional ? 
  yea , but i 'm talking about the origin of `` white '' . 
  well , i 'd would probably sit on reddit reading this post and wondering what ideas for dealing with crisis people from other countries have . 
  then i 'd probably waste my time . 
  then is it possible that white ru\u015b ( aka belarus ) actually comes from `` baltic ( lithuanian ) ru\u015b '' ? 
   the as in the is more like a d and the one in three has something of an s in them . 
  from polish perspective first is between d and v , and the second is something between t and f. and probably every non-english is going to compare these to different sounds . 
  reverse trianon , then close hungary-bosnia border . 
  best plan ever .

  itt nordic people arguing with southerners whether light spank is corporal punishment or not . 
  i 'm not even reading the comments . 
  it is going to happen sooner or later . 
  the best guys are the ones who say that gypsies come from `` rumunia '' and that `` romania '' is completely different place . 
  ( to foreigners reading this : `` rumunia '' is polish word for `` romania '' ), 
   europe was already united against napoleon . 
  * most of europe, 
  [ after that small part of land in ~ ~ western ukraine ~ ~ former eastern poland our right-wing butthurts about ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lendians ) also according to some polish people after our legendary founder , lech . 
  the term `` lechitic language '' does come from his name , though . 
  i just saw someone claiming that western slavic languages and romanian ( !!! ), 
  originate from russian and appeared in the dusk of middle ages . 
  so did ukrainian and belarusian , even though , since they are basically modernised versions of ruthenian , it 's more like it 's russian what originated from them . 
  hungarians apparently appeared out of thin air in pre ww2 borders . 
  basques and welsh do n't exist . 
  nor do slovaks . 
  slovenian is the same as serbian/croatian even though its basically unintelligible for most of other slavic speakers let alone yugoslavs . 
  it does n't even sound slavic aside from grammar elements . 
  irish is spoken only in west of ireland , for some reason . 
  i think i can assume that the rest of the map is about just as bullshit . 
  some highschools ( and some middle + high school groups ) do n't require this . 
  especially those which have 2 or more separate buildings . 
  also , in many schools you often do n't have to change shoes in spring/summer when yard is open for breaks . 
  well , he 's not really dumb , nor does he seem like potential emigrant . 
  moreover , he 's eager to work . 
  i 'd say he 's already more valuable to state than , like , 70 % of polish population . 
  better do n't give silesians new ideas .
