   poland generally blew the last two decades of education .

  but chinese also uses exactly the same script for all dialects . 
  and since hanzi are pictograms dialects can use completely different words and still be written the same way as long as the grammar remains the same .

  [ you forgot poland ] ( http://www.shlomohsherman.com/toons/uforgot/forgot2.jpg ), 
   it was only in 1596 when king sigigmund iii vasa moved the capital to warsaw , because he did n't want to constantly travel all the way from krak\u00f3w for sejm meetings , as well as he claimed the swedish throne and wanted to be closer to sweden . 
  not really , sisigmunt moved his residence to warsaw , but de jure krak\u00f3w remained the capital until partitions , despite having no political significance any more . 
  also , while moving ` de facto capital ' near sweden and lithuania was his official motive , actually he did it because a part of wawel castle was burned due to his failed experiment with alchemy .

  polish elementary schools teach the german way and often outright disallow using snowman method . 
  you just accidentally noticed one of the main differences between the pronunciation of russian and polish . 
  poles would always merge that last soft-vowel-only syllable with the previous one , but russians would always say it as separate one . 
  thus georgia is `` gruziya '' in russian , but `` gruzja '' ( pronounce ` groozya ' ) in polish . 
  now , japanese took russian way of pronouncing and applied it to english version . 
  yes , it still makes no sense , i just wanted to point it out . 
   if i was a rich man who viciously murdered a child and then paid off the child 's parents ... should those parents be granted the authority to have me not be punished for my crime ? 
      if i stole a bicycle should the victim of the theft , the bicycle 's owner , be allowed to sentence me to death ? 
  neither of these examples involves victim dismissing the court . 
  of course victim has no power over severity of potential punishment , but they still should have power to pardon the culprit as long as all other victims agree . 
  this ca n't apply for case when any of the victims are dead , insane or underaged , of course . 
  laws meant to protect citizens should n't be applied when citizen rejects such protection .

  [ cke communicant on matura 2015 exams . 
  ] ( http://www.cke.edu.pl/images/_egzamin_maturalny_od_2015/informatory/2015/matematyka-19wrz.pdf ) for people not knowing polish : example questions with answers are on pages 41-64 ( basic exam ) and 65-110 ( extended exam ) . 
  looking at these questions there would be it 'd be really hard for a basic level question , and mildly hard but doable on extended level . 
  nevertheless , the question would n't be put on the exam , as the image may be considered misleading and the description is way not clear enough for matura standards . 
  on top of that derivatives ( afaik they 're going to be back next year though , but only on extended level ) are no longer required on the matura , rendering the b point hardly doable , but if they 're required in scotland this would n't be a point to make . 
  if you make them do non-constructive work , you have to feed 20 years and pay for their pointless work on top of it . 
   dig a hole , fill it back up etc ; the work should n't be constructive . 
  why ? 
  you would need money for shovels and terrain to use for that . 
  it would be waste of money of the state . 
  not to mention moldova is pretty much poor to begin with . 
  well , if it makes things any better people in poland use either `` stany zjednoczone '' ( `` united states '' ) or english abbreviation `` usa '' so the name does n't really suggest the location . 
  `` zapad '' is a bit archaic word for `` a collapse '' or `` a decline '' in polish . 
   also , pedestrians stop and wait at the red lights , even if there are no cars coming anywhere . 
  this is actually also common in poland , but for different reasons . 
  it was only confirmed legal in 1932 . 
  before that homosexuality was n't mentioned in law at all ( why would it ? ) . 
  there never were any laws banning it in free state ( although there were while the country was partitioned or occupied during ww2 , these however were imposed by outside powers ) . 
  inb4 silesians trying to lynch you . 
  while i do n't really mind becoming part of asia , you know that moving asia-europe border to oder would make italy the `` eastern europe '' ? 
   there is , as far as i 'm aware , no attempt to teach `` creationism '' in schools . 
  i ca n't recall right now if religion ( catholicism primarily ) classes are mandatory or not but i get the feeling they are n't even if they were 20 years ago . 
  they are optional , but most of people go for them , because it 's a good grade for free ( idk how it is like in america , but here you get prizes and scholarship when you 're above certain average of grades . ), 
  also , creationism is almost non-existent . 
  even on religion lessons evolution is usually taken as default , while creationism is only one-lesson topic ( just to let students know that this philosophy exists ) . 
  but seriously , on this lesson back in high school ( or was it middle school ? 
  i do n't remember ) my religion teacher asked just-in-case whether someone in the class ( of ~ 30 people ) believed in creationism . 
  no one did , herself included . 
  nah , malta and vatican are more religious . 
   also , having dress codes in school weirds me out . 
  wait , while i know of many private schools in poland that use dress codes , i 've always thought usa is a kind country that would rather discourage other countries to use dress codes . 
  are there really uniforms in us ?

  1 it 's generally not being received very well by richer people as making out with random guys/gals ( prostitutes excluded ) is generally seen as something poor people would do . 
  except for medics , medics do it with anyone and are relatively rich at the same time . 
  `` while not dating '' is not really a word as the border between couple and f * ck-friend is n't clear . 
  generally if you know the other person well no one will be frowning upon you if you have sex with them . 
  `` while drunk '' is not really a good word either , as making out with random person would be more frowned upon if you 're sober . 
  c'mon why would anyone not get drunk ? 
  ad 2 i was in the city 's top high school and i would say it 's maybe max . 
  so in less educated areas it 'll maybe go up to 7 ? 
  of course i 'm not counting exceptional nymphos/cassanovas . 
  quite a lot of people do n't have sex at all in middle and high school , and even if they do they do n't brag about it that much . 
  oh and a note : after prom we go home instead of camping , and if anyone would want to have sex they do it in private , you americans are weird in that respect . 
  ad 3 this question is pretty weird . 
  is n't it couple-dependant how they date ? 
  like some couples prefer to go out somewhere , some just sit at home and learn together / play games / watch movies . 
  or do you mean whether they prefer monogamy or open relationships ? 
  then here it would most likely be the former . 
  emperor ? 
  tsar ? 
  caliph ? 
  ( grand ) duke ? 
  grand prince ? 
  khan ? 
  pharaoh ? 
  kaiser ? 
  supreme leader ? 
  or maybe ... `` pope '' ? 
  in europe , king by definition is a person crowned by a christian leader . 
  it is commonly regarded as lower than emperor ( who may rule multiple kingdoms aside from his own ) and higher than grand duke , grand prince or duke ( who is n't officially crowned ; also a king can rule several duchies/principalities similarly to an emperor ) . 
  not only the pope is n't crowned by christian leader ( as he becomes christian leader himself after coronation ) but also gains ability to crown kings of other countries , while normal emperor/king can officially do it only within his own territories . 
  finally and probably most importantly , vatican is not referred to as neither monarchy nor empire nor duchy nor principality , but as papal state , which means the title of monarch there is `` pope '' .

  you can add `` in poland '' or `` in silesia , poland '' before each sentence in points 1-3 . / 1 .
