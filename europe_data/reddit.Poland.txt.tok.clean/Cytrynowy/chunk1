it 's a bloody good name though . 
  godwin 's law . 
  thank you , good night . 
  i can not find an english article to save my life , so [ here 's source in polish ] ( http://natemat.pl/176857,dyrektor-telewizji-republika-chce-kary-smierci-dla-tuska-ewa-stankiewicz-chcialabym-moc-realizowac-sie-zawodowo ) . 
  the headline reads `` head of republika tv calls for death sentence for tusk . 
  ewa stankiewicz : `` he deserves capital punishment '' curious fact is that she never actually used words `` death sentence '' but it was heavily implied with words `` the most extreme of penalties , brought back to polish legislation just for this exact case '' . 
   now they made them look like literal fascists pis does n't need any help with that . 
  publicly calling for death sentence for former prime minister is not what i 'd call a dialogue for peace . 
  unrelated note : if you use \\ before a command character , the backslash will nullify the command . 
  like this : \\ \\ \\* test * turns into \\* test * . 
  is your only argument `` i hope you 're trolling '' ? 
  because that speaks a lot about you as a person . 
  now that i have a comparison i have to admit that poland 's parliament looks very classy . 
  minimalist but thanks to dark wood and collerating greens makes it very pleasant to look at , unlike some of those overly fancy ones . 
  if only people inside were classy too . 
  [ same old shit . 
  russians annexed crimea , ukraine wants it back . 
  [ i 've no idea why would you say that . 
   after the crimea bullshit hah . 
  you say that as if the conflict in crimea ended . 
  good one . 
  they were closest to my ideological and political beliefs and there 's no way i 'm voting for cronies in sld or the idiots in psl . 
  there was no other real choice for me , so i just went with what i was most comfortable with . 
  guilty as charged . 
  i think it 's a national tradition at this point . 
  i 'm generally a leftist ideologically and voted for . n , but i have to agree with szyd\u0142o on this . 
  based on first hand experience ( my girlfriend works in a hostel and i used to hang out with her there sometimes ) people from middle-east ( and generally muslim countries ) were among the rudest and most violent people we encountered . 
  some of them even tried to touch her and grab her hands saying stuff like `` she 'd be a good wife in the harem '' , and when rejected / ordered to back off they threw a fit about how rude the people in poland are . 
  immigrant adaptation to western society is a joke . 
  poland can not into design . 
  i think it 's more about attitudes than anything else . 
  the joke `` how do you know if someone 's a vegan ? 
  they 'll tell you themselves '' is actually very true . 
  i know a lot of vegetarians and vegans ( some family members , too ) that can not resist reminding everyone that they 're not eating meat . 
   i was under the impression that poles had a very high opinion of the us . 
  it 's pretty paradoxal . 
  everyone 's `` wearing their blue jeans and listening to their pop music '' , america is regarded as the `` go to place if i 'm rich one day '' but the most extremist far-right voters believe that the only things we import from usa is political correctness and homosexuals , and obama should have never been elected . 
  do n't forget vegans . 
  their main rhetoric was that razem and . nowoczesna were pos toadies and psl + kkw are communists . 
  that left us with kukiz '15 ( a far-right party created by pawe\u0142 kukiz , a rock singer-songwriter ) , korwin ( our main parliament controversial right wing clown , janusz `` 1 % '' korwin-mikke ) , and pis . 
  basically , right wing was the only side that could provide them the change they wanted . 
  no in betweens . 
   i 'm willing to bet that many of their voters are happy about that . 
  hitting the nail on the head . 
  there 's a common saying among the far-right ( something along these lines , at least ) : `` when the pig driven away from the trough squals , it 's proof the medicine is working as intended '' . 
  pigs meaning leftists , centrists , vegans , germany , tusk , intelligentsia , homosexuals , jews , muslims , usa , basically everything that is n't associated with pis . 
  it 's not that they love pis , it 's that the previous government under po party was arrogant and full of themselves , and the people do not care about what changes , they just want change . 
  they have two armadas ? 
  no way we 're messing with those guys !, 
  some serious words : you sir , are a douchebag . 
  that 's a weird way of spelling poland . 
  the current ruling party is already cutting down the trees so sadly not gon na happen . 
  remind me to never go to school in ` murica . 
  or go see movies . 
  or work in a tall building . 
  should i go on ? 
  we require more vespene gas . 
   baltics the hell !??!,

  spain says ** no ** !, 
  it 's a polandball meme . 
  look it up .

  twitch chat strikes again lul, 
  knapik is a fucking legend . 
  makes traveling by public transit much more enjoyable , he vo 'd like 99 % of buses and trams in warsaws ztm . 
   mongolia  velociraptors i have several questions, 
  to be perfectly honest i have a problem holding a conversation in polish , too . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ understand ^ ^ ^ people, 
  irrelevant to the topic . 
  i have nothing against the building itself , however the ` worship ' of huge crowded malls is what grinds my gears . 
  buzzing hives of mindlessness and consumerism is what they are . 
  here comes the unrelated to the topic frenchman !, 
  watch out or we gon na teach you how to use the fork . 
  we just looove cats !, 
  that 's what this result is about , right ? 
  but when buying lay 's you 're paying 150 % the price for 50 % of air in the packet !, 
  never tried them , not big on crisps in general . 
  might have a look around regardless because i 'm intrigued . 
  he meant crisp brands , not vinegar . 
  salt and vinegar is one of the most popular crisp flavors over the channel from what i remember . 
  you dare challenge me ? 
   sometimes its cheaper to fly to turkey i wonder why :d, 
  really cool , thanks !,

  still , our numbers of wolves and bears are low and they 're considered endangered . 
  everything is accommodated to suit tourists to the point even tourists can feel tired of it . 
  can not compare the prices though , never been to western mountain resorts . 
  i 'm polish and been to zakopane many times . 
  this is how it looks like in real life . 
  i do n't need a camera . 
  [ poland can into space !,

  less * our grey wolf populace is around 500-600 in the whole country . 
  that 's very low . 
  edit : all brown bears are under protection as their numbers are also low, 
  you 've never been to zakopane then . 
  in the mountains .
