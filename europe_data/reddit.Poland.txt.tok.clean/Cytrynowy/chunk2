   [ if you have to explain the joke , there 's no joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddp1pf_mb8 ), 
   could it be that the translation simply means '' [ generic surname ] '' ? 
  exactly this . 
  nowak is created by combining the word `` nowy / nowa '' ( `` new '' ) with a '' - ak '' suffix which is fairly generic and can be seen in many other surnames ( eg . 
  `` maciejak '' , `` olejniczak '' and so on ) . 
  it also has nothing to do with blacksmithing . 
  both kowalski and nowak are surnames you can actually see a lot of ( got one of each on my street , even ) . 
  in polish , surname from the word `` smith '' ( kowal ) is kowalski . 
  on par with nowak in terms of popularity . 
  any fellow poles can confirm we do n't have those here ( training i mean ) ? 
  i live and work in warsaw and have n't heard one in a year or so ( besides the warsaw uprising memorial one ) . 
  ca n't escape the dank memes even here . 
  the show did no justice for poor old stannis . 
  in the books he actually cares about the people close to him , in his own , stern way . 
  he also is cynical about r'hllor and faith in general . 
  you see a waiter say to a customer to `` sit the fuck down '' you can bet he 'll be fired the same day . 
  stop talking nonsense . 
  my neighbor ignored every unwritten rule in our settlement . 
  roofs are interchangeably rust red and brown with matching garage doors and fences . 
  our segmentowiec ( four family twin house , for non-polish people ) has brown roof , garage , and fences but mr. nowak decided to install rust red roof , firetruck red garage door , and green fence . 
  looks fucking awful . 
  it 's kind of the same in poland . 
  even though we 're not taking refugees in , there are some people who might take you for an arab . 
  native speakers are needed for translation jobs , you 'd have easy time looking for one . 
  ... man , figuring out what is a joke and what 's not is really hard when all you got is text . 
  he 's joking . 
  seen [ watchmen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3lsjmwno40 ) , can confirm .

  sadly , have to agree .

  ~ ~ poland is ex-ussr too , you know . ~ ~ do n't mind me , just went full retard for a second, 
  it 's called czaj in prisons from what i 've been hearing . 
  it 's not sarcastic . 
  many of the far-right poles and the whole current government are homophobes calling for anything gay related to be banned . 
   y' all need the greater good in your lives xeno scum, 
  you keep telling yourself that . 
  they took our jerbs, 
  i have nothing to do with those people . 
  should i be ashamed just because i was born in the same country as them ? 
  do n't bother yourself with him , he 's one of the most known trolls on / r/polska . 
  do n't . 
  we 've got a fair share of idiots too , both in poland and abroad . 
  keep calm and carry on . 
  ... meanwhile , poland 's gov oppose migrants from the middle east saying `` they will rape our women '' . 
  i mean , maybe they 're right ? 
  we 've got our own rapists , i suppose they do n't want competition ? 
   the difference is that scientology is a ** scam ** and not a religion .

  these hydraulic press channels are getting out of control,

  hurts so much our current government is trying ( or already did , i 'm not following it ) to legislate penalties for saying `` polish death camps '' . 
  turkey is not part of the european continent . 
  yeah , they take us for finland .

   who got rid of all the guns in poland ? 
  they were never here in the first place . 
  an average civilian does not have a need to own a gun . 
  both are just shit . 
  `` pole '' is `` field '' in polish too . 
  that 's where the name of our nation comes from - the [ tribe of polanie ( polans ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polans_ ( western \\ ) ) , people of the fields . 
  am slav . 
  it does n't . 
  nuclear power plant breathing fresh air into a sexist pig contest , what a time to be alive, 
   why do polish jokes exist geez , i wonder why . 
  been to iceland 2 years ago for my birthday . 
  really liked the `` if you do n't like the weather in iceland , wait 5 minutes '' mugs in tourist shops . 
  do we actually live in the same country ? 
  the pis narrative remains the same for years : `` eu brought us nothing but homosexuals , muslims , and dangerous anti-polish ideologies '' . 
  i have no idea if we did it yet , reddit,
