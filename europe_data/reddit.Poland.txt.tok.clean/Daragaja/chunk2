   :( ** independent greater poland nao !, 
  we won in greater polish uprising and germany is respecting that ! ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  actually not , we 're pretty german with our potato love and richness , but shush , nobody has to know , rite ? 
  is also superior and less german , visit ** pozna\u0144 ** ! ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  do n't you know ? 
  everything that has been german once is german forever !, 
   local qualifiers is beyond stupid . 
  eurovision is about doing something bright , prominent and eccentric , but people/juries keep voting for the standard pop-songs that all sound like each other and are being forgotten the second song ends . 
  i do n't know how it happens in other countries , but this year ukraine 's entry will be extremely unremarkable . 
  it 's my main problem with eurovision . 
  last year there was so much remarkable songs and people , yet they got voted out or not voted at all at , while 10329438 women in dresses signing cheap pop songs got trough . 
  also , yes . 
  check out german and british songs , they 're just plain and boring . 
  kawa it is, 
  jesus sorry for writing my autobiography here ^ it 's ^ just ^ that ^ nobody ^ listens ^ to ^ me ^ irl poland has a bad period recently , a lot of people we 're fooled by pis , thinking they 've changed and will bring something new and better into the country . 
  but they did n't and if that was n't enough , all that alt-nazi , extremely catholic came out of their caves . 
  weird things are happening . 
  but i have hope something will change - after years of weird stagnation in polish politic there 's way more new parties , and i believe there is a high chance of change - change for good . 
  about the us , mind you that pis is pretty lost - v4 are n't doing exactly what they want them to do , so they turned to us , hoping new american government will support them but it has already failed , because us of a could n't care less about some poor eastern european nation . 
  and in the end , as the visit of merkel ( and later prime minister of ireland ) showed , they came back to europe like prodigal son . 
  about the refugees , well , immigrants , since they mosty are , it 's a very complicated topic . 
  and while i do agree we should stay humanitarian and help everyone who needs help , europe is extremely fragile being . 
  it 's the same old europe that have been through ethnic cleansing and crazy alt-right leaders with weird mania over superior races . 
  we 're not us , most european countries were n't created as a multicultural states . 
  and i do believe that ideology fails - because humans are hateful , territorial beings . 
  and while you and me may say - we 're going to enjoy our cultures in one country in a free way , others will say that my culture prevents them from living in their culture . 
  they will take me as an enemy , because i am different . 
  some people are above that , but most people are n't just , putting it honestly , smart enough . 
  because tolerance is a weapon of intelligence . 
  there 's also whole concept about globalization and sweet jesus like i have n't already wrote absolute bullshit . 
  but the thing is , i have not idea how to resolve this problem in reasonable way because it 's both : very hard subject and i 'm not intelligent enough to have an answer . 
  coming back to the ( actual ) topic , i doubt any of the leaders are lead by such ideas and it 's simply dislike for `` different '' by the people , polish , czech or hungarian . 
  i 'm essentially pretty neutral in that topic and either of the answers provided by left or right just do not feel `` right '' for me . 
  should greece and italy be left with the responsibility ? 
  but should v4 just give up and roll with the `` everyone gets a little '' plan ? 
  i believe not . 
  but yeah , the days of us being the `` always right savior of civilization '' are long behind us . 
  and russia at least does not pretend it is our ally . 
  ** tl ; dr ** i try to be smart on the internet and fail , also i 'm neutral on refugee topic because solutions provided by both left and right do not feel right to me and i 'm not intelligent enough to come up with my own solution . 
  i also kinda dislike the `` we give you money '' argument because it creates the illusion that european union is a being that pays and demands and if you do not agree to something eu comes up with , you 're ungrateful bastard . 
  let 's come up with something together , instead of dividing eu into `` ones who pay '' and `` ones payed to '' , because it creates tensions in both groups and destroys unity . 
  and unity is the u of eu . 
  well , memes aside , i think poland has a great chance of being very important , since it is one of the biggest countries in eu . 
  give us several years and weimar triangle may become a real deal in union . 
  which i think is good , since poland kinda represents post-communism block . 
  but italy is also a great player and another big country . 
  so maybe some kind of european square is all that we need . 
   poland has nothing to offer [ hello darkness , my old friend ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zlfcngvel4 ), 
   when you 're really low and it makes you sad but then you notice slovakia is one point lower and you 're glad since they 're always better than us on polls . 
  i 'm disappointed in me too :(, 
  it list germany in western europe only ? 
  did you even checked the source you `` provided '' me ? 
  arguing with you is pretty pointless , since you constantly change your `` points '' and always try to appear as a victim ( `` the only reason people are butthurt is because i said eastern europe exist '' ) . 
  the only reason for this `` argument '' we 're having is the fact that you 're openly saying eastern european are worse and putting oh-so-glorious-germany together in one group with poland is insulting . 
  cry my a river , because the concept of central europe is based on a common historical , social and cultural identity and if you have problem with this then maybe your country should n't invade poland and czech republic so many times . 
  at least we have something else than beer !, 
  i actually like being eastern european , it 's just people treating us like wild animals i hate . 
  i 'm not saying emigration of polish people is fine and dandy , it irritates me to , because out of million polish imigrants , maybe two hundred thousand will really integrate . 
  and it 's not about polish only - it 's normal . 
  they 're not emigrating because they like said country , they 're doing it for mony . 
  you ca n't force someone to integrate when he 's there for monz and monz only . 
  it denies everything you wrote . 
  the statistic do not use term `` central europe '' because it 's not always used . 
  it counts whole balkans , together with slovenia , in southern europe , while you called them eastern europe , only excluding greece . 
  you also completely removed baltic from northern europe . 
  idk what you 're trying to prove . 
  the source you provided divides europe geographically , not culturally nor economically and is completely useless when talking about anything besides geography . 
  central europe/western europe/eastern europe have they own definitions , you ca n't just include and exclude any country you like/dislike . 
  like greece , which is as eastern as romania or serbia and is orthodox . 
  but it 's not slavic , that 's why it has to be in a `` better '' part of europe . 
  again , if whole italy and southern france is `` southern europe '' then why croatia , montenegro or albania are n't ? 
  because you said so . 
  amazing . 
  and there 's me asking why some people hate germans . 
  so what is , eastern germany ? 
  i see , so let 's create separate subbredits for eastern and western europe , because apparently eastern europeans are subeuropeans . 
  also , poland is in central europe , buddy . 
  we do n't have to sneak into europe , we 're european , thank you very much . 
  spread the glory of the glorious western slavic empire . 
  also glad you like it , it took me 30 minutes to make, 
  * fid\u017ci *, 
  this subreddit is very welcoming but on the other hand i 've never felt a need to show that i am a girl , not on this account and neither on others i use here sometimes . 
  because in the end , we 're all european and different genders does not make our points less valid . 
  i was thinking more about average kowalski , sorry for generalizing . 
  not really . 
  turkish people do not go around with pakistanis , right ? 
  even though both are muslim , cultural differences are still major . 
  same thing would happen with tatars . 
  many things had been said , so i 'll just leave it here : i used to have a massive crush on mario mand\u017euki\u0107 . 
  like , do n't judge me or anything , but jesus is this man attractive . 
  i kinda passed away with the time , but i am still a massive fan of croatian football team !, 
   there are even some pieces with lyrics . 
  you know , you could 've made your own comment and post song you think should be an anthem . 
  like you know , op asked you to do , since it 's fun to read different opinions on the internet . 
  how about tetris theme . 
  have you ever tried to hum chopin . 
  also it 's just my opinion , you do not have to get so feed up about it . 
  i think rota is a better song not because it is nationalistic , it 's better because it is a better song . 
  jesus people on reddit . 
  we also have korwin , but is he more trumpish than great jaros\u0142aw ?
