   `` you do n't understand . 
  we are n't racist . 
  we do n't have black people ! '', 
  ( i have heard the second one multiple times from different nationalities and it makes zero sense , so do n't try to use it ) to your information this is accurate . 
  we were n't abusing black people like the rest did . 
  so we do n't have them right now , simple . 
  you ca n't be racist when it 's not an issue . 
  xenophobic , yes but only older people . 
  and that 's what every sane person would adapt . 
  they have every right to be xenophobic towards russia and germany . 
  i really recommend to visit krak\u00f3w and o\u015bwi\u0119cim ( auschwitz ) or google the look of 1945 warsaw . 
  you will get on the same conclusion . 
  people tend to forget this is recent history . 
   as far bad experiences , i do n't have the impression that people will try to scam me in germany . 
  my brother was tried to be scammed with intention in austria , so . . thats only impression . 
  edit : quoting fail, 
  actualy i was living in this city my first 19 years and i have observed less racism than i have had in my weekly visit in paris . 
  it 's really common target for erasmus , the whole city is mainly consisted of students . 
  my parents rented flat for students ukrainians , kazakhstans , turks etc. 
  so i am calling bullshit . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff2wp1btqte my own translation for those intrested : dear people , a tragic event has occured . 
  there has been choosen a politician , who has broken every rule that yet occured in european union . 
  mainly the neutrality rule . 
  he did ' t stick to this rule . 
  and you could clearly say abused this radically . 
  he intervene in domestic polish cases , with a lot of dedication . 
  in special events , when there was huge destabilization . 
  a rule has been broken , which says that high european position are acquired by people backed by their own domestic country . 
  and finally we have to deal with election of a person which straight up lie . 
  as far as yesterday he assured , he 's neutral . 
  its a thesis that has nothing along with a facts , it 's an obvious lie . 
  and finally europe , poland , all off us need to know that europe council chairman , is a man which participated in emigation politics . 
  in such a way , that if he wanted to enforce his ideas and views ( as i assume he belived in them sincerely ) into life . 
  we would have to pay enormous penalties , destroying penalites . 
  or we would have been forced to take emigrants . 
  and this is huge danger . 
  and that 's why i repeat , bad thing has happend . 
  but as well , we have good news . 
  we have a miss prime minister , that for sure courageously defended polish intrests , against all odds . 
  she could oppose everyone . 
  she shown up , poland has his own opinion , she shown up that donald tusk ca n't preform a duty with white-red flag . 
  that he wo n't be able to make his intervenes in polish domestic cases , and to conect other statements with poland . 
  because for now , he has broken what we conect with loyality to his own country . 
  and this is elementary , completly trivial principle , value to which everyone that wish to function in european politics should appeal to . 
  i do n't know any examples of european politcs that works in eu , that have in such a unequivocal way refused this loyality . 
  and that our prime minister , could oppose that . 
  it 's a really good sign . 
  that 's a good sign for poland . 
  because if we would have agreed uppon everything , we would have been in sitation . 
  ** idiom alert ** that everyone could have jump upon us ** idiom alert ** . 
  we are n't such case , and everyone knows that . 
  and this is a good news , this is really good news , and that 's what 's important . 
  this is the most important news of the day . 
  poland regain subjectivity , poland has finally after the po ( civic platform party ) , which has destroyed subjectivity - became a sovereign nation , that protects it 's own intrests . 
  ai n't media evil ? 
  objective media does not exist in any single country , you can get into ignorance bouble , so you cant see its biased . 
  actually the only one unbiased . 
  young people also vote even in my highschool that is known from being liberal there was 20 % who openly voted for them, 
  polish history teach something else :( we actually did that ~ 400 years ago . 
  that did n't go well . 
  you have more similar culture , that 's why it appeals less attractive for you . 
  actually to be honest , he was doing good in the interview . 
  kinda impresed with waszczykowski english skills ( acent is strong though ) . 
  he 's above tusk in this case . 
  it upsets , how this journalist tried to provoke him . 
  im starting to lose a patience . 
  when im spending 25 min of my life i expect a quality content , instead of 10 minute of a cringe . 
  tremendous !, 
  i always tend to say people have satelites and spaceships from socialism , and people are n't starving because of capitalism . 
  i really feel like pure capitalism and socialism are extreme ideologies and the most successful ones are the ones that mixture both . 
  like china or scandinavia . 
  there was n't any successfully country that was pure socialist and neither was a successful pure capitalism country . 
  any possibility for 4k version of this image ? 
  * the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza * technically speaking it 's a lie . 
  karersee , south tyrol , trentino-alto adige , italy , eu , europe , earth , orion arm , milky way , laniakea, 
  i knew something stinked , but i could n't find a source . . 
  against both , at once . 
  ukrainian influx , hidden taxes , lowering of curuption and some accounting tricks ( previous goverment did that too ) also pln is insanely strong right now , still not even close to 2008ish but pln/usd pln/chf is like 20 % stronger than it was half year ago . 
  edit : also eurozone is really strong right now , which we indirectly benefit from . 
  it still would n't have been positive if we didnt get a payment from nbp gains from previous year ( its standard though ) . 
  its expected that it will be positive for the next month , but it will shrink cause there is a lot of investments planed for next months . 
  hungary already have such system too, 
  a sentence informed , educated person would say . 
  their stance is neutral actually , dropping out two civil projects proved that . 
  stop atacking brits on reddit it 's getting boring and unfun . 
  if they ever considered to work for a minute . 
  maybe ... ukrainians proved that they would already , so the choice is simple . 
  your last argument is invalid . 
  we have 4f and reserved and w\u00f3lczanka with superior quality . 
  i really need to visit uk beside london . 
  ah good old french fries , 
  tbh it 's not such fault of any side . 
  situation was complicated because budget need to be ratified fast enought to continue . 
  although the opposition had some objectives , i ca n't tell if reasonable because pis stoped any discussion . 
  and then this mess has happened . 
  funny enought 2nd ( 3rd ) constitution was ratified by poles , because conservatives were on holidays .
