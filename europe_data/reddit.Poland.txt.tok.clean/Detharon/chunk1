well , perhaps romanians want to live this way . 
  it 's their country and their own choice . 
  imposing a point of view using force wo n't change that . 
  friendly advice : if you 're unhappy that people link this day with the communist ideology , then please consider not using a communist anthem to promote it . 
  as simple as that . 
  perhaps because having an abortion could lead to some side effects ? 
  just guessing . 
  ai is amazing in discovering new insights that humans consider unthinkable . 
  access to real world data is necessary in that kind of research . 
  patient-identifiable information ( name , surname , address , birth date , etc. ), 
  are completely irrelevant to the data mining process ; you ca n't possibly find a connection between , let 's say , being named patrick and having diabetes . 
  they do n't get such information because it probably would be illegal and they simply do n't need it for that purpose . 
   where did they come from ? 
  this is a very hard question , i do n't think there 's a consensus among historians about the slavic homeland , but definitely not finland  probably somewhere around modern day ukraine , russia , belarus or poland . 
  also , it 's not like eastern europe was uninhabited before that : on the contrary , there are archaeological evidences of many distinct cultures . 
  it is very unlikely that proto-slavic people originated in one place and started conquering their neighbors , but nevertheless we can trace some common roots , for example [ this old legend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lech,_czech,_and_rus ) , while obviously not being a historical fact , sheds some light on how our ancestors perceived their ethnicity . 
   they were pretty insignificant before the fall of west rome . 
  because they settled in europe after the fall of rome . 
  they could n't really `` own '' any of the polish tribes , since they had no common border . 
  modern germany was partially populated by [ sorbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbs ) and [ polabian slavs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polabian_slavs ) - they 're even marked on the map . 
  no it is not . 
  gross claims that poles `` actually killed more jews '' , and that he 's `` telling the truth '' , so he apparently considers this as a historical fact , yet he does n't back it up with any proof . 
  this is an extremely unscientific behavior . 
  the other historian merely admits it 's indeed possible if we do n't count the polish army . 
  gross never made such assumptions . 
  buying russian gas has never been the issue , after all gazprom is the cheapest supplier around . 
  though it 's not very wise to give them monopoly in the european union , considering that : 1 ) while being very reliable for their western european partners , gazprom is being used as a [ political tool ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s187936651100011x ) for the others . 
  2 ) once they completely bypass eastern europe , they can threaten to cut off our gas supplies , which would no longer interfere with supplying germany and other western european countries . 
  i think it needs to further explanation why we do n't want them to have that leverage over us . 
  3 ) once we 're completely reliant on them , they can simply raise the prices . 
  that 's how monopolies work . 
  that 's why we 're trying to diversify out gas suppliers , for example by importing liquefied gas from qatar . 
  an eu-wide joint negotiations and common gas price would be even better for our energy security . 
  actually , this was the eu goal not so long time ago , so it 's pretty strange that suddenly germans are doing the exact opposite . 
   we have very big differences in terms of gas prices . 
  the higher the share of russian gas in purchases and the bigger monopoly russia has in supplies , the higher the prices are  oettinger also said that europe should have pan-european grids for natural gas and electricity , including more power links between countries and should increase the diversification of its energy imports . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/eu-wants-same-price-for-russian-gas-for-all-its-members-oettinger/ ) . 
   also we can use this as leverage in the future , when germans will ask as to do something against us national interests . 
  wishful thinking . 
  germans completely ignore how much they harm other eu countries by supporting it . 
  quoting merkel : `` i made clear , along with others , that this is a commercial project ; there are private investors '' . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i think that all popes ( at least in the recent times ) were against the death penalty , so there 's nothing unusual about it . 
  after quick googling found this : http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1403 christians are encouraged to forgive their enemies , and one of the commandments explicitly says `` you shall not kill '' , so opposing the death penalty should be a logical consequence of that . 
  if not reddit i would n't even know that this cover caused any outrage . 
  this is how the freedom of press works , right ? 
  they can publish that no matter how much politically incorrect it is . 
  after all it 's no more shocking than [ this ] ( http://nadblog2.blog.pl/files/2013/10/du%c5%bcy-lis.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://static.wirtualnemedia.pl/media//press/16/700/2015-09-21.jpg ) . 
  but what do i know , according to the media i live in an * illiberal democracy * . 
  well , they once banned few opposition sites , because they encouraged to take part in the protests . 
  sounds completely unjustified for me : http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1372672, 
  eh , really ? 
  let 's see . 
   while i sit in own cosy home in safe neighbourhood i can write whatever i want on reddit . 
  \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440 used to block websites criticizing the government . 
  even reddit was targeted once over some silly stuff . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/reddit-banned-in-russia-because-of-one-thread-10453063.html no similarities here , polish internet is free from any form of censorship , we never restricted access to any site . 
   read any newspapper no matter of political views my or paper editors . 
  russia is well known for press censorship . 
  https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/russia again , no similarities here , polish government does nothing to suppress the freedom of speech , no matter how harsh the critique is . 
   i never felt forced what to think and how to think . 
  independent journalists , for example those creating the meduza.io , decided that it 's impossible to run their business in russia and so they moved to latvia . 
  and again , no similarities to poland , because you can find the whole spectrum of points of views in our press . 
  i can easily name several either pro or anti government . 
  all quoted sentences clearly do not describe the putin 's russia , so where 's the similarity ? 
  do you actually read the polish/russian press ? 
   ominous , too , is the way that opinion is dividing . 
  there are two confronting polands of roughly equal strength . 
  one , including the pis supporters , finds its base in eastern poland among small , pious farmers and working-class families who have lost jobs and income through the change from a state economy to an often ruthless neoliberalism . 
  the other poland , usually better educated and better off , is desperate to preserve what it sees as the historic achievement of 1989 : the first reasonably stable and prosperous liberal democracy in polish history . 
  i thought the guardian despises generalizations , but apparently they do that themselves if it suits their agenda . 
  the reality is n't black and white . 
  if only the highest educated ( at university level ) people took part in the elections , pis would have won as well , because they had the highest support in all social groups . 
  it 's true that as the education level increases , the margin gets smaller , but it 's not like mostly `` poor and pious farmers from eastern poland '' are voting for them . 
  data : http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,140716,title,glosowanie-w-wyborach-parlamentarnych-wedlug-wyksztalcenia-infografika,wid,17932248,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=11650e also , the economic liberal korwin party , that wholeheartedly supports the `` ruthless neoliberalism '' , is at the same time very unhappy with the modern poland , especially when it comes to our membership in the eu . 
  the polish post-communist left party , sld , is openly anti-immigration . 
  weird , is n't it ? 
  the politics in poland is way more complex than the guardian is making it sound . 
  edited . 
  i meant to say that , but after reading the comments i realized that it can be understood twofold . 
  out of curiosity , why would anyone complain about it ? 
  i ca n't find any downfall of knowing english , or any other language , in fact , i feel it 's the very opposite . 
  there exists a separate issue , often connected with the corporate environment , where people use english words even if there are good equivalents in their native language . 
  it 's not about how well they speak , but how many of them can hold a conversation . 
  that 's the methodology used in eurobarometer studies . 
  here 's the link , relevant results are on page 21 : http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/getsurveydetail/search/languages/surveyky/1049 but yeah , according to english proficiency index they 've the lowest proficiency in eu . 
  http://www.ef.co.uk/epi/ perhaps quite a lot of french people know english , or think they know it , because eurobarometer relies on self-assessment , but in fact they do n't speak it very well . 
  that makes sense , indeed . 
  if that 's what he meant , then i misunderstood him , thinking that he had in mind the entire group . 
  i know they 're not immigrants that came here during the recent influx . 
  i mentioned that because they use the same kind of fallacious rhetoric . 
  there are also eastern european legal immigrants all over the europe , well integrated and speaking the host 's language , also having families and stable jobs , yet nobody claims that they 're all engineers , because that 'd be a blatant lie . 
  i do n't understand why muslims portrait themselves as superior to average people . 
   `` our people are nervous , some of them have left . 
  there are not many of them , i do n't want exaggerate the situation . 
  some of them are thinking about leaving . 
  * they 're mostly doctors , engineers , and technically savvy people * '' , explained hasna . 
  oh come on , this is getting ridiculous . 
  this is exactly the same thing that was being said over and over again about the syrian refugees . 
  there 's no society that consists only of well-educated specialists . 
  you ca n't cheat the gaussian distribution , that 's how the nature works .
