... and there was much rejoicing in rural poland !, 
  since scotland may very well become the newest european union member at a time when david cameron is threatening to loosen/cut ties with brussels , i 'd argue that scottish independence is of concern to every eu citizen . 
  it 's a subjective judgement . 
  because of the `` i '' following the `` c '' it sounds softer to my ear . 
  that 's my story and i 'm sticking to it . 
  `` czci\u0107 '' ( tch-cheech ) which is the infinitive of `` to worship '' in polish . 
  it has all the different varieties of `` ch '' sounds , including the hard `` cz '' ( tch ) , the softer '' \u0107 '' ( ch ) and arguably the softer still `` ci '' ( ch ' ) which results from an `` i '' following the `` c '' . 
  thought of another mickiewicz-related joke : just as some background : adam mickiewicz wrote sir thaddeus ( pan tadeusz ) which is considered a masterpiece of 19th century polish literature . 
  two cops enter a book store . 
  after looking around the place , they approach the saleswoman behind the counter . 
  `` we 're looking for sir thaddeus '' one says . 
  the saleswoman turns toward the backroom and yells : `` hey thad , get over here , they finally came for you ! '', 
  ... and dubya before that and clinton before that ... american presidents have been promising poland visa-free travel since the fall of communism , never failing to remind poles what a great friend america is to them . 
  this story has become tiresome ... 
  meanwhile , visa-free travel for polish citizens to the us is still nowhere in sight . 
  thanks a heap for for all the empty praise , chuck !, 
  sorry albania , pickpocketing is n't an actual sport . 
  naaaaah , you 're just a temporarily confused part of * poland * . 
  another geographically-challenged american confusing lithuania with louisiana . 
  i empathize with the gesture . 
  for me , experiencing the brexit is like watching your favorite aunt and uncle get divorced after they 've been together for as long as you 've been alive . 
  this is a very sad time . 
  do you also celebrate ivan the terrible getting his ass handed to him in the livonian war , the butthurt from which resulted in a reign of terror across all of russia in the form of the oprichnina ? 
  how exactly is poland a threat to russia ? 
  are the poles secretly plotting to take over kaliningrad ? 
  so the time of troubles , ensuing polish occupation of moscow and installation of a polish puppet tsar just happened with russia 's full consent and cooperation ? 
  why bother ? 
  we have the european union . 
  `` continuing to allow eu migrants to settle in the uk without restrictions would allow the economy to attract talented people , mr johnson said . '', 
  i wonder how the chavs who beat up poles and romanians as a hobby will feel about this . 
  thought the same thing : the starosielce suburb of bia\u0142ystok ? 
  meanwhile , the eu urges the uk not to impose restrictions on the free movement of people within europe . 
  notice that they did n't ban the headscarf , because that would mean banning all the old ladies on their way to church . 
  it 's at least as much about the 1.2 million uk citizens who currently reside in continental eu countries and may have to return `` home '' if article 50 is invoked . 
  `` i 'm moving out !, 
  ... but first i want to set down some ground rules about my moving out . '', 
  in polish , `` dupnica '' translates to `` ass-town . '', 
  when we had geography as grade schoolers and learned of its existence , it became a joke-filled anecdote : `` you 're from dupnica !, 
  - no , * you 're * from dupnica . '', 
  `` yeah , well , you smell like you 're from dupnica ! '', 
  `` why do n't you stick your head up your dupnica ! '', 
  `` when i kick your dupa , you 'll run crying back to dupnica ! '', 
  and so on . 
  a few more colorful ones : szczecin - of stubbles t\u0142uszcz - fat ( as in lard ) \u0141apy - paws wronki - little crows pszcz\u00f3\u0142ki - little bees n\u0119dza - poverty sk\u00f3rcz - cramp czerwonka - dysentery stare juchy - old scoundrels and lastly : zimna w\u00f3dka - cold vodka ( no joke - just southeast of opole ! ), 
  by that standard , iranian presidents are also democratically elected . 
  kremlin : `` we 're not paranoid !, 
  not paranoid at all ! '', 
  next up : `` belarus to the eu : let 's talk membership '', 
  the adl also loves to blur the line between anti-semitism and anti-zionism ( or any criticism of the state of israel for that matter ) . 
  perhaps the us visa requirement for polish citizens will finally come up for discussion , but there i go hoping again . 
  nope , not me . 
  you must be thinking of another polish dude . 
  i 'm not particularly offended by polish things not being the centre of attention . 
  several polish sayings , just off the top of my head : ** nie m\u00f3j cyrk , nie moje ma\u0142py ** . 
  literally , `` not my circus , not my monkeys , '' uttered by anyone who chooses not to be involved in someone else 's drama . 
  it was recently made famous in the anglophone world thanks to episode s05e01 of orange is the new black . 
  literally , `` where dogs bark with their asses and drink water with their dicks , '' referring to any isolated , far off place that has been divorced from progress and civilization . 
  it 's also a nod to [ lucian 's `` true history '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/true_history ) , which describes an imaginary land of strange creatures beyond the strait of gibraltar . 
  variants of the same include ** gdzie diabe\u0142 m\u00f3wi dobranoc ** ( `` where the devil says goodnight '' ) and ** gdzie wrony zawracaj\u0105 ** ( `` where crows turn back . '' ), 
  literally , `` lingering like a fart on a pair of drawers , '' referring to anyone wandering around aimlessly and getting in the way . 
  post-brexit , in the age of pis , orban , putin and erdogan , high support for the eu is good news . 
  / r/engrish for the title . 
  it should read : `` the majority of slovaks support european union and nato membership . '', 
  that 's all lovely - for a fourth grade book report . 
  now can we have some serious interrogation about different definitions/dimensions of communism , other than `` they have a hammer , sickle or a yellow star somewhere on their national emblem . '', 
  that only works in part . 
  the islamic republic of iran is the epitome of a theocratic islamic state , with on-again off-again reactions against the west . 
  [ still , they teach evolution in schools ] ( http://www.nielsenlab.org/2016/02/teaching-evolution-in-the-middle-east/ ) . 
  old and outdated historiography . 
  the northern crusades are entirely omitted . 
  buyer 's remorse ? 
  robert schuman has been named [ `` servant of god '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:french_servants_of_god ) by the catholic church , which is the first step toward making him a saint . 
  apparently , he needs to be credited with a miracle to be promoted to blessed robert schuman . 
  by that reasoning , having child labor outlawed at the turn of the 20th century was a waste of time , because parents are going to send their toddlers into coal mines and iron smelters anyway . 
  as a point of reference : [ currently , 32 european countries have banned child corporal punishment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporal_punishment#/media/file:corporal_punishment_in_europe.svg ) . 
  i wish i could upvote this twice . 
  europeans invented the very idea of a [ longue-duree history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longue_dur%c3%a9e ) the kind that looks for antecedents beyond treaties or political agreements . 
  the quest for the origins of a united europe deserves the same kind of an approach . 
  we 're not americans , after all . 
  he 's right up there with grendel . 
  i completely disagree with the argument that the latin lyrics are `` banal and meaningless . '', 
  in the aftermath of brexit , when the very idea of europe is under threat , the exhortation to remain united in a common cause ( et unita maneat ) , to celebrate its broad diversity ( una in diversitate ) and be an example of peaceful cooperation to all the world ( pacem mundi augeat ) , are more significant than ever . 
  i beg to differ !, 
  latin was spoken in the classical era and was the spoken and written lingua franca for any literate person thereafter , well into the end of the early modern era . 
  ask erasmus , in many ways the father of the european idea , what language he favored and conversed in . 
  [ una in diversitate ] ( http://sylwiakorsak.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kku0ysq.jpg ), 
  all right , but apart from the sanitation , the medicine , education , wine , public order , irrigation , roads , a fresh water system , and public health , what have the romans ever done for us ? 
  metal tusk !, 
  kellogg was also an early supporter of the eugenics movement . 
  in 1911 he founded the so-called race betterment foundation that advocated for racial segregation , compulsory sterilization for `` undesirables '' and stringent immigration laws against those who could `` damage the gene pool . '', 
  the american circumcision craze had a religious underpinning . 
  it was popularized by john harvey kellogg ( of the corn flakes fame ) , a seventh day adventist and an anti-masturbation crusader , who believed the procedure would act as a preventative measure against `` unchastity . '', 
  [ ... and stashed them in swiss banks . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/14/world/swiss-acknowledge-profiting-from-nazi-gold.html ), 
  supreme power was n't within grasp back then . 
  if it meant getting elected , i 'm sure she 'd say she feels `` muslim . '', 
  damn , even i was surprised by that one !, 
  * americans have always had a special affinity for france . 
  * like the time they re-christened french fries `` freedom fries '' ? 
  i 'm wondering if any of my fellow euros are in the habit of naming their vehicles , or if that 's strictly an american thing .
