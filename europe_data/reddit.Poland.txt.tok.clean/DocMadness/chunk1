  i do n't know if any other nation is whining for reparations , propably it is n't only poland ( and not everyone cares here about it ) . 
  unfortunately martyrdom is strong here , and current goverment is adding more oil to the fire . 
  every year we have have some celebrations about failed warsaw uprising ( narodowy dzie\u0144 pami\u0119ci powstania warszawskiego ) , but not for example winning battle of warsaw ( or any other positive event .

  italy was a german ally during most of world war ii . 
  spain did n't participate in world war ii . 
  polish peoples republic under pressure from ussr refused to take any reperation from west germany after the war .

  alcohol : 18 years old . 
  shopkeepers are required to see id , if someone looks very young . 
  i bought alcohol being 15 years old , but i always looked older , and i 've never been asked for my id .

  similar to buying alcohol underage , i do n't smoke , so i do n't know .
