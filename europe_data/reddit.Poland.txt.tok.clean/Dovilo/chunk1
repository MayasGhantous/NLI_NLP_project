  but ussr was not ready for war in 1940 , moreover they were not ready in 1941 too , enormous casualties during first phases of barbarossa , while they had more soldiers , tanks and resources , prove it . 
  [ purging army ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_purge ) just before it starts to heat up is a bad idea . 
  without britain there would n't be northern african front and without it there would n't be italian one . 
  [ north african campaign ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_african_campaign ) was conducted only by britain and rest of commonwealth until 1942 . 
   the findings contrast dramatically with a survey conducted by a french polling institute in may 1945 , which found that 57 % of the french public believed that the ussr contributed the most in the second world war , compared to 20 % for the us and 12 % for the uk . 
  a poll conducted in 2009 also found that 63 % of russians believed that the ussr could have won the war on its own . 
  not 50s but just after the war , before the iron curtain . 
  it is in the article . 
  i think so too , especially since nazis [ thought about britain warmly before the war .

  wait , what ? 
  we are both making assumptions on theoretical situation that usa does n't support anyone during the war , since it never happened , we both have no ** actual ** facts . 
  but since you like facts , there are some for you . 
  usa sent : to ** ussr ** : ~ 2.000 locomotives ~ 11.000 railcars ~ 12.000 armored vehicles ( with 7000 tanks ) ~ 11.400 aircrafts ~ 430.000 trucks ~ 13.300 combat vehicles ~ 35.000 motorcycles ~ 2.700.000 tons of petroleum products ~ 4.500.000 tons of foodstuffs - almost all of their radio equipment and a lot more . 
  all of that stands for $ 11.3 bilion . 
  i ca n't find actual quantities of goods sent to uk but they stand for ** $ 31.4 bilion ** , almost three times more than to ussr !, 
  even if uk would survive by their own , i highly doubt ussr would , there were on the edge with germans under moscow . 
  and even if they would i highly doubt uk would made western front on their own . 
  well , without usa there would n't be one either way , not mentioning eastern front would probably lose . 
  i doubt that without [ lend-lease ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease ) both uk and ussr would survive the war . 
  actually i do . 
  well , ussr in some part of their history ( mostly during ww2 ) was more fasict than socialist . 
  during stalin 's regime national pride , working and fighting for country , totalitarian head of state , removing bothersome people ... everything checked .

  i do n't believe in freedom to destroy everything you see just because you are angry . 
  in my country it 's called vandalism and it 's a crime . 
  we can protest without massive destruction in people 's property . 
  while i see freedom to speak , freedom to express yourself , freedom to protest etc. 
  as a principles of democracy , breaking people 's stuff just because it 's on the street you march on is not one of them . 
  there is exposition we do n't like going on in our city .

  yes but imposing austerity during crisis took out a lot of money desperately needed by economies making things even worse . 
  for me austerity should be an economic doctrine during times of prosperity , not when shit hit the fan , it should give them surplus of money during fat years . 
  countries should use that cash reserves during bad times but even pre-2009 they had enormous debts dragging them down . 
  for me it is kind of upside down of like it should be . 
  germany not really . 
  but spain , portugal or greece that were hit mostly by crisis and imposed austerity - yes . 
  for us yes , they calculate year-over-year gdp growth by taking last quarterly growth and annualising it like / u/jakub70 said . 
  but in the eu it 's not that popular . 
  we just calculate year-over-year by taking gdp last year and today 's . 
  well , after 5 years they are [ still below pre-2009 level ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:esp&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ),

   immigrants are taking hungarians ' jobs  they should be forced to work lol, 
  well i think they want ukraine , ( old cliche `` russia without ukraine is a country , russia with ukraine is an empire '' ) but much more they do n't want ukraine to be part of the west . 
  after euromaidan they caught themselves with pants down and with urge to act quickly . 
  between eu 's ukraine and ukraine on fire they just chose the second one . 
  yes , 50 % of russia 's export ( mainly gas and nafta ) goes directly to the eu . 
  without that i doubt russia would survive for a long time even with their enormous cash reserves . 
  while it 's clear that russia is trying to restore lands lost after dissolution of the soviet union ( caucasus , ukraine , next would be baltic states ) , attacking part of eu and nato is a completely different thing . 
  not only because of its military but because of their dependence on west 's economy too . 
  20 % of gdp and 60 % of russia 's export depends on nato 's states . 
  we just ca n't accept everything putin does like west accepted early hitler 's moves ( austria , czechoslovakia ) . 
  he is not a crazy man , he will think twice if he meets with strong opposition . 
  ah , now i see that in original link there was price per gallon and in this link it 's per litre . 
  from which year is it ? 
  today 's eur/usd is 1.1 and i see here something near 2.0 . 
  yeah , i 'm not falling for that . 
  you even mistook balkans and baltics on purpose . 
  for a while i took it seriously :d, 
  i do n't know , i never met a stupid martian . 
  no but it take a bit of time , and money , to improve education , especially in eastern europe . 
  not really , eu has more population ( 510mln vs 322mln ) but yes , they are twice as big as eu .

  it 's from 2005 , 8 years before croatia joined eu . 
  this are statisctics for eu25 they represent almost all of the today 's union , including poland and sweden . 
  of course it falsifies outcome for every country by itself but so does checking data for entire usa instead of every state or even checking for the entire country instead of every province . 
  and yes , there are we , we the european union . 
  not as big mistake as taking [ prussian homage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_homage ) instead of destroying them . 
  two hundreds years later they were absorbing us . 
  well , there were part of british empire not that long ago , eastern europeans were never . 
  the only reason why ussr took this lands and gave them to poland was because they took polish lands and inherited them into ussr . 
  there was no thinking `` we should destroy prussia because it 's a cancer of germany '' , it was just a clay grab . 
  it 's from 2005 , statistics probably changed a lot since then . 
  but it shows that we should n't laugh when similar data is published for usa since we are not much better . 
  this article is wrong in so many places it 's hard to even read . 
  a major help for isis are muslim kids that lived in europe but became extremists after isis propaganda reached them . 
  they send them money or even join their ranks . 
  with proper education we could minimise losses . 
  because history of islam will not tell you why jihad is not about exploding things or history of christianity will not tell why we should n't make another crusade . 
  if kids will not learn about religions in schools they will learn in other places and that can end very badly . 
  oh yes , there is a lot of them so we should probably only focus on the biggest of them . 
  christian , muslim , hindu and buddhist contributes for about 80 % of world 's population . 
  you know if it 's in separate subject or not , it does n't really matter if hours spend on it would not change .
