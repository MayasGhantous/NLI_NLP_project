  technicalities . 
  does it really change anything ? 
  it 's teaching ** about ** religions not indoctrinating someone to actually believe in them . 
  yes , i know , i said it myself . 
  not really , education is an extremely good way to fight extremism . 
  and why should we when 89 % population on earth believe in something ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm atheist myself but schools should teach childrens about world around them and religion is important part of the world . 
  well , they should teach about ** every ** religion in form of religious studies in secular states . 
  if country is secular it should n't take sides . 
  is there really ? 
  different countries handled colonies differently , from very bad types ( i 'm looking at you belgium ! ), 
  to quite nice ones like french . 
  we can not just forget that some countries really believed in their destiny to help africans in their way to prosperity . 
  they built schools , roads , hospitals ... 
  it 's not a case where we can definitely say everything was bad . 
  so probably not to berlin but to polish border and back :d, 
  with ageing population costs of social care per capita such as public health care or pensions is rising . 
  and while costs are rising , great recession is not giving up and revenues are not growing adequately so goverments are trying somehow to look for savings methods . 
  main problem with intermarium was that pi\u0142sudski wanted poland to lead the entire union . 
  border conflicts and even wars with neighbors definitely did n't help either . 
  because he painted eastern poland perfectly . 
  yes , it 's time to invest in eastern poland . 
  oh yes , quite many actually , up to 800 thousands in 1920 . 
  they went all the way to warsaw . 
  but this was in 1920 , it 's more of extension of world war one than beginning of new one , especially since poland was fighting with soviets from 1918 up to the 1921 and only after that they could have peace . 
  well i think we are still megalomaniac but yes , most of the culture in these times was created by noblemens . 
  peasants during romanticism were n't educated , first efforts to changed that were in positivism . 
  maybe he was n't worse but definitely he was n't anyhow better . 
  and what rewriting do you mean ? 
  do you deny polish-soviet war in 1919-1921 ? 
  or do you deny that germans were at first welcomed as `` liberators '' in baltic states ( that of course changed rather quickly ) ? 
  or maybe you deny milions of life that soviet opression has taken ? 
  there was proposal of alliance with germany just before the war with very bad terms but i never heard of proposal of alliance from ussr . 
  even if there was one how could we get into alliance with country that attacked us 20 years earlier and everywhere red army went they were destroying , raping and killing ? 
  of course there were countries that had submitted to ussr ( lithuania , latvia , estonia ) and they were so happy with that they were throwing flowers on wehrmacht when they came to `` liberate '' them . 
  well , at least you do n't know about our grab of zaolzie from czechoslovakia after munich treatment or our plan to invade germany with france in 1933 . 
  can we still be friends ? 
  nazi collaborators ? 
  hosting nazi concentration camps ? 
  you speak as if poland had anything to say in that matter , almost as they volunteered to be conquered by germany and happily started to gas poles and other nations , jews included , in a gas chambers . 
  and look up on the history of jews in ussr , you will be suprised how much they did n't love them . 
  prometheism is an extention of the older polish romantic movement . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe patritioned poland in the eyes of polish romantic national poets was a `` christ of europe '' bringing freedom to the entire continent . 
  yes , we are megalomaniac . 
  refugees are also people who `` have well-founded grounds for fear of persecution because of their race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , and is unable to obtain sanctuary from their home country or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country . '', 
  via [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee ) . 
  of course it does n't mean he had this `` well-founded grounds for fear '' because he obviously did n't but a refugee can mean much more than simply running from war . 
  not really , dax or cac 40 have fallen for only 12 % it is way lower than 28 % on wig20 . 
   it seems you was n't searching good enough or just in wrong places . 
  here you have a more specific information and few details . 
  and yet you still have n't show me one . 
  i see tvp has also problems in that matter . 
   it 's english speaking subreddit and really nobody cares about the fights between the local polish parties , not to mention that the post is about stock exchange . 
  welp , true . 
  `` here '' what ? 
  show me ** one ** . 
  do you mean '' `` niewykonane '' ? 
  do you even know what does it mean ? 
  that means that goverment did n't change act or article that was sentenced by tk . 
  does it mean po just did n't listen to tk ? 
  ** no ** , these acts/articles no longer have any legal force , ** they are no longer valid ** . 
  that 's the problem , most of polish society has no idea how tk works . 
  i have searched and i did n't find a single instance when tk said something is unconstitutional but the act/article is still valid . 
  what do you mean by `` finally '' ? 
  it 's always time to invest in eastern polan : v, 
  so we should let pis do anything they want , including unconstitutionally choosing new judges ? 
   they are absolutely biased and it 's obvious they will be used to block most , if not all , major initiatives coming from the ruling party . 
  why is it obvious ? 
   so how this gov disregarded constitution ? 
  for now when szyd\u0142o said they will actually print tk 's sentence ? 
  nohow , but i did n't say anything about it . 
   but as for disregarding the sentences of constitutional court it 's unfortunately not a bullshit . 
  show me one . 
  how did previous goverment disregard constitution ? 
  and please , no more bullshit about po not implementing tk 's sentences , that 's not how tk works . 
  yes but election promises matter . 
  the chart is of course wrongly labeled but let 's say it differently . 
  [ wig20 have n't been so low since 2007-2009 market crash . 
  simply speaking of new taxes can bring stocks down . 
  and they say they will impose new ones so stocks are falling hard . 
  but it is caused by theirs election promises . 
  wig20 is mainly composed of stocks of banks ( falling hard because of new taxes ) , khgm ( they turned away from the idea of removing additional tax applied on this company ) and others hit by new taxes . 
  furthermore , replacement of ceos in companies with majority of stocks in government 's possession is also causing downward pressure . 
  sure , i do the same , i disable adblock on sites that i like and that are not using invasive forms of advertising . 
  by the way , did yt step up with their ads ? 
  i still have them blocked since moment they compelled me to watch 3 minutes long ad in the middle of 10 minutes movie . 
  - `` so , to make it look realistic , we gon na bomb prague . '', 
  - `` wait , what ? '', 
  - `` it 's all for the movie mann ! '', 
  what if this is the real nazi party but they are hiding behind film set ? 
  well , there is next book i need to read . 
  so , since lithuania is a country ... and poland is a country ... maybe some little union ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ mean ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ commonwealth, 
  what does it mean it will collapse another 12 % after collapsing completely ? 
  if something collapsed completely how it can collapse even more ? 
  those damn germans , dragging our glorious , polish economy down . 
  that is not an excuse . 
  i mean you still have both your kidneys right ? 
  i had to think about that name for a while to realize you mean [ ko\u015bciuszko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadeusz_ko%c5%9bciuszko ) . 
  homogay lobby of course .
