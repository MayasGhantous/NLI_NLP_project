yes , they were called [ ruthenians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_poland#polish.e2.80.93lithuanian_commonwealth_.281569.e2.80.931795.29 ) ** but ** ruthenian \u2260 russian . 
  of course , you are free to say that ruthenians were just [ polonized ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polonization ) russians but i disagree with such a statement . 
  they had an own , unique culture with influences from lithuanians , poles and russians . 
   do you collect all of the vote boxes and count them at one location ? 
   we count in each electoral school and so they are all done at the same time and usually takes a few hours . 
  same as in poland ... except the part `` usually takes a few hours '' , 
  i 'd say in polish it sounds neutral . 
  something like `` white-ish rus '' . 
  but `` white russia '' ? 
  it sounds like a proper name for racist/xenophobic organization of russian nationalists . 
  they were populated mainly by belarussians , ukrainians and ruthenians , not russians . 
  it sounds kind of racist . 
   of course it would be nice if they also paid the reparations . 
  have n't they ? 
  i thought the communism was the best thing they could give us !, 
  thanks for downvotes . 
  the truth hurts it seems , 
   they decide to chose this national day with a referendum in 1995 ( after communism ) predictable . 
  just like every elections win of alexander lukashenko , 
  it 's obvious that you , as citizens , are not going to take the blame for what [ your govt did in middle east ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_syrian_civil_war#united_states ) but i 'm pretty sure that your govt sooner or later will realize that they eventually have to help europe fix that shit . 
   this is not a secret poland had plans to take whole lithuania at that time . 
  i guess at that time it was more like `` eez bros , lithuania is almost polish anyway , let 's concentrate on colonizing ukraine now '' ( main reason of oun-upa coming into power ) . 
   while the pun is funny , poland conquered in 1920 territories of ex-russian empire in which poles were less than 5-10 % ( the rest were ukrainians , russians , belarussians , jews and others ) . 
  these were the territories of ex polish-lithuanian commonwealth !, 
   how many south americans have you taken in ? 
  because we take in a million a year this is completely irrelevant . 
  europe do n't operate in south american region . 
  the usa ** do ** operate in the middle east and the situation in this region is so bad mainly because of american support for islamic jihadi rebels . 
  guess it 's the part `` pressured by ngos not to report it '' . 
  i see . 
  so the only solution is to negotiate a new agreement . 
  i 'd discuss if it was generous or not as during the war , the west was supporting bosnian and croatian militias so it 's obvious to me that the serbs would lose miserably . 
  why do n't they ask the people of rs if they want to be a part of b&h ? 
  a zombie zombie zombie . 
  is it good or bad for such a small country ? 
  eli5 : what are the advantages of proclaiming independence from spain ? 
  afaik , catalonia already has autonomy in many aspects . 
  it is estimated that polish women abort about 150 000 pregnancies abroad yearly . 
  lithuania ? 
  where did you get that information from ? 
  it 's mostly germany , slovakia , austria and even the netherlands . 
  is turkey a poor country ? 
  that should n't surprise you to be honest . 
  a lot of them ( if not most ) usually live in areas where immigrants from poor countries are a majority because apartments/flats are way cheaper there . 
  so apparently poles experience their culture everyday . 
  romani people do n't identify themselves as europeans either ... 
  they use a division : them ( white people ) and we ( gypsies ) . 
  they clearly states their culture is different than european . 
  they live in europe but their culture is completely different than european culture . 
  but farage says that poles are a real problem in uk !, 
  no , they wo n't be deported .

  i disagree . 
  i ca n't judge the person that has n't even started yet . 
  eu as federation wo n't work . 
  that 's why it would be better to focus on smaller federations of countries with similar culture , economics etc. 
  eu is good as its original concept of union of sovereign states . 
  to be honest , orban can not count on poland . 
  our current govt do n't really like him and what is more , they usually do what merkel wants anyway . 
   but there is a reason why v4 stop being important to all of those countries the reason is that everyone thought that eu is enough , as we can see it is not the truth , v4 would be a good thing to cooperate in the eu itself . 
  for example , by taking the same stand on different issues we could easier push our ideas through eu commissions . 
  would n't say so . 
  tusk was kind of average but kopacz as pm is a complete mistake . 
  thanks but i think that we have enough of unions with ussr/russia :d, 
  v4 has a great potential , unfortunately it 's pretty much ignored by the member states . 
  average pole ? 
  may i have a source of this statistics ? 
  at least armenia is considered as a part of european culture group . 
  if we look at this in terms of geography then cyprus is not europe too . 
  armenia is a trans-continental country . 
  geographically , it could be said it is part of asia . 
  some say that armenia is actually the gateway inbetween the two continents , but some say russia is . 
  however , politically it is considered a european country since the history relates to europe more than asia . 
  also , it is near enough europe to have direct connotations and it mantains great relationships with european countries like russia , spain and germany . 
  it is not part of one continent when speaking in general but can alternate when talking about history , geography and politics . 
  thanks for that post !, 
  i 'd argue with 1 or 2 points but as a whole it clears up very much . 
  sorry for my attitude , i just thought you 're one of these people who criticize just for the sake of criticizing , with no rational arguments , i was wrong though . 
  greetings . 
  such people wo n't run for office . 
  i 'm just being realistic , 
  successful musician , an average pole with terrible ideas for the country . 
  do n't know foreign languages , ca n't even speak his mother language properly . 
  we already had a president that `` did normal work like normal citizens do '' before he was elected , lech wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  yet another one like him ? 
  hell no . 
  best cosplay ever , 
   but completely omitting anything other than `` allies did/said x , poor poor poland '' does n't even begin to scratch the surface of the polish perspective it surely does , they tell in the video about the most important events from the polish point of view . 
  not all of course but one can safely claim it 's in general a polish perspective . 
   that 's sole purpose is supposed to make poles angry at other european countries or sad that poland has been so mistreated . 
  actually we already are , this video does n't change much in this regard . 
  we won the war , yet we lost is miserably . 
  during that time we 've been sold twice . 
  first time uk & france bought some time , the other one usa & uk sold us to soviets . 
  this is pop-history . 
  as i wrote before , and got downvoted , it 's impossible to tell everything in a 13 min video . 
  they do n't deny any facts . 
  the way they present history is just a formula of their yt channel . 
  i also added in the title : `` a short overview of ww2 from polish perspective '' . 
  that 's clearly describing intentions of the video .
