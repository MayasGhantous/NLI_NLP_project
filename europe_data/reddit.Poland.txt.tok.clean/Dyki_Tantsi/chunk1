* our healthcare is shit * not enough churches you must construct additional churches, 
  finally !, 
  you can go to moldova ? 
  well tbh a relaxed sunday without people storming markets sounds cool to me, 
  so by idiots you mean germany and confused lower netherlands ? 
  i thought it was by china , not cccp ? 
  did you ever hear the tragedy of darth scot the wise ? 
  i thought not . 
  it 's not a story the brit would tell you . 
  it 's a eu legend . 
  but potato is cooked, 
  why lithuania , why ? ... 
  yes, 
  does ... that mean euro is shaky ? 
  [ of da relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z80inxp9j5g ), 
  not a ` pic of europe ' tho  also nice the thing setting, 
  now it 's stuck in my head , congratz, 
  but ... that makes no sense in your context, 
  needs more blue, 
  dat guy, 
  there is a honor code , also its a street art , not a museum gallery, 
  you nailed it, 
  [ here ] ( http://img14.deviantart.net/fc6e/i/2009/258/9/a/colours__squat_trooper_by_wrightauk.jpg ), 
  basically same thing . 
  also a worst possible thing to compare dres to, 
  that would make sense for millionaires , it would be interesting data, 
  i pronounce gif with a hard g, 
  you are right ( especially in places where churches are the only landmark buildings in the area ) but i 'm implying if not for churches ; castles , watchtowers and palaces could have replaced them . 
  castles and watchtowers , same thing, 
  969 , the number looks so stylish the only better year to build that would be 999, 
  well tbh nkorea just sits angry on its ass while russia sends troops here and there , so yeah, 
  amen to that , it co-created shit in the first place, 
  the dutch are reclaiming the land, 
  beautiful for aliens looking at us , shitty for the other way around, 
  but . . but . . glorious yurop . . is fake ? 
   the word used in old church slavonic language ( \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0467\u0434\u0430 ) sounds closest to the current polish language pronunciation , as polish is the only slavic language which retains the nasal vowels of the proto-slavic language . 
  nothing of this here : / ( unless in some remote part of poland i dunno of ), 
  yes , but `` the star-spangled banner '' pretty much categorizes itself, 
  but ... is it same girl ? 
  jews ' and muslims ' welcome party, 
  holy crap , i 've never heard of it . . and it looks delicious, 
  and what about a married city ? 
  freedom exclamation mark, 
  looks like a horizon is folding , inception style, 
  cyrillic is great . . until it 's handwritten, 
  `` ee '' - problem fixed ? 
  ( i butcher german not writing umlauts ), 
  tbh the problem with female vocals is that they make any language sound soft , but you are right i like the [ hey sokoly song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qguw3xxsk ) the most for comparison, 
  yeah , so similar , and the first wplyw is identical  ' \u043d\u043d\u044f ' suffixes make it sound so russian to me , and ' \u0430\u0442\u0438 ' so chill and folksy ukrainian sounds like a soft fluff pillow, 
  you better go counquer belarus, 
  on the other hand , i can not understand czech nor read it . 
  i noticed it works only one way ... is it because polish culture is more prevalent and simply czechs are more interested in it , or just my confirmation bias ? 
  or is it real for any other reason that polish is easier to handle for czechs than czech for poles ? 
   sorbian til , at first i thought you were trolling with that name lol, 
  to my polish ears , russian and ukrainian sound alike , but the latter is much much more understandable, 
  the passion of the brexitheart : the choice ? 
  * some say it 's freedom , some say it 's pride * * when everything goes to shite *, 
  you got me, 
  i would watch it and i thought i would become a doctor, 
  nice one, 
  ah yes , lublin is awesome , especially those narrow streets in the old town, 
  can confirm , still dying here, 
  pozna\u0144 is ok , looks like bydgoszcz without cool canal to me , and i was passing by gliwice just once so ca n't really tell . 
  also i was talking about the biggest cities , with katowice its cheating, 
  not sure if lmao, 
  what the nazi did you just nazi say about wroc\u0142aw , you little breslau ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the underground resistance , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on gestapo , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in gorilla warfare and i 'm the top sniper in the entire ak armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the nazi out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking code-words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the eastern europe and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , nazi . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i do n't have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what catholic retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your nazi tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , nazi . 
  i smoke smog unwillingly ( you can have that too ) , but anyway , [ this is great imo ] ( http://www.turystyka.bydgoszcz.pl/upload/image/bydgoszczzpowietrza181216.jpg ), 
  what a great role models , those filthy eurosceptics opposing peaceful integration into prosperous ~ ~ empire ~ ~ europa, 
  what source ? 
  wroc\u0142aw and bydgoszcz are the only big cities that appeal to me ( in poland ), 
  no suffering is comparable , but i see now , thanks for the answer man, 
  me too ... 
  i mean it is n't ` my-history-has-more-suffering-contest ' , but why ? 
  it is the loss of those colonies ? 
  russian fantasy books in a nutshell, 
  random generated flatland by the sea, 
  looks almost like a middle-earthian lake-town, 
  i 'm not sure what i was expecting but not some backyard ftfy here -  http://i.imgur.com/ihfttmp.jpg, 
  it 's clearly a brexitalibur vs german longsword, 
   waarom niet beide lol now i see why dutch is called a german dialect / s , yes, 
  copy paste from [ here  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/5ue4az/katana_vs_german_longsword/ddtc7jf/ ) `` a famous blacksmith is testing a katana vs a german longsword . 
  he made both weapons exactly in the same way like they were made in the past . 
  he even imported iron ore from japan for the katana to use the same material . 
  he knows that katanas were n't designed to cut other blades but he wanted to bust the myth because many hollywood movies are showing katanas that are destroying other blades . 
  also he wanted to show that the european swords were superior in quality at this time because they had access to better quality materials and europeans already made swords for several thousand years . '',
