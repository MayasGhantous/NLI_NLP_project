  everything you said is correct except handsome part, 
  so it 's a chinese hogsmeade , it just appears empty due to magic . 
  that 's fine , but why is the rum gone ? 
  and i always thought shittier land would be more fertile, 
  no , this is how you lose arguments because of overreacting if there are lies , there is nothing to defend , it only gets worse by sticking to the level, 
  `` my dear bro , have a nice nuclear plant here ! '', 
  `` you are too kind , here goes one as well ! '', 
  i sense tension, 
   istanbul  capital of europe heh , this belongs to another thread here , `` how to annoy europeans '', 
  nope , only french and americans, 
  for the record , it 's because bulgarians actually invented the script in the first place ? 
  i see , it makes sense now , thanks for the answer,

  calm down , he prolly is just joking if not ... [ galicia is ours anyway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galicia_ ( eastern_europe \\ ) ), 
  mass emigration started just after we joined eu , since then quality of life improved a lot , but it still sucks compared to western europe . 
  but imo it 's not bad , now we have mass imigration of ukrainians, 
  i reversed it upside down and keep it as mobile lockscreen , it 's glorious . 
  now this is something beautiful for / r/dataisbeautiful and the map ... awesome !,

  what a time to be alive in poland, 
  i agree , that movie was better, 
  well it is far fetched , but slovak is probably the most understandable slavic language to all slavs, 
  ah , slovak , the slavic esperanto, 
  it seems that we protest hard to have orthodox catholics, 
  * huff ... * no one * huff * expects spanish * puff * inquisition nice try, 
  oh look , surzhyk/russian consumes ukraine from east, 
  czechia : conversion in progress , chance of success ( 20 % ) send more missionaries edit : btw , that 's kinda ironic cuz czechs ( bohemians ) are why poland was baptised in the first place in 966, 
  lol , is this serious or just fake/an easter egg ? 
  * tears of joy * for poles , baltics and croatians, 
  wait ... 
  i already use russian , it 's happening . 
  but why i am not using cyrillic ? 
  so ... it was the only military ` success ' of austrian army, 
  ok , take care , 
  make `` tur '' ... again !,

  festung europa did n't work well last time, 
  looks like a good place to * start * a zombie apocalypse then find footage, 
  we need more words like this , i like it, 
  this castle is awesome , but its ruins and empty inside . 
  but there are so many passages one can lose direction the central rotunda looks like a small coliseum and the name of the castle is literally ` crossaxe ' , because of cross and axe symbols on the front gate, 
  i would be happy to live there too, 
  or a land-crawler aircraft carrier , since they have no sea access, 
  bugatties and lasers . 
  especially laserz, 
  technically they are neutral , so no allies .

  / r/trees / this is a joke on many levels now, 
  what reference , what is the proverb ? 
  dogs riding horses , a guy beating world fasting record , parkour on the roof , boys putting firecrackes on tram tracks ... not much has changed but i came on the winter street with tram cables photo [ here is the bot 's colorization ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n5ajowv.jpg ),

  they made me learn glorious cyrillic so that 's a plus, 
  it 's scary because it does n't, 
  tl ; dr what eu citizenship gives you : - consular protection as stated here - you can freely move , work and live within eu - you can vote and be voted in any local elections you live in - you can vote and be voted in european parliament elections - you can bitch to ombudsman and to parliament - a right to not be bitched and discriminated - a right to acces eu documents in your language,

  there are english subtitles , and there is also a second 2.0 movie, 
  i see your point to a degree , but with that thinking next thing we will see is russians blaming evil west for not stopping them . 
  `` it 's west 's fault for not stopping us from doing evil things ! '', 
  i would n't be surprised by that absurdity, 
  do n't forget that this is yurop not usa, 
  that 's an opinion , not a judgement . 
  that 's the typical generalization of a group of people - it does n't apply to everyone , but shows some pattern , just a common sense and social psychology . 
  nothing wrong or bad about that, 
  of course , nothing is that simple , it 's just another perspective . 
  also coping does n't exclude being ok with the jokes , actually that 's the point, 
  but it 's a form of coping , self-immunization to outside threats just like the jews make sick jokes about themselves all the time , because for centuries they have been under attack so they had to cope to deal with the shit, 
   remembrance even further , it 's about maturing , admiting to your wrongs and taking a lesson from it, 
  not defending anything or anyone here , but having their enormous empire fall apart just like that had to leave a scar on their pride ... add genocides to admit to and that is a pretty hard pill to swallow, 
  we do n't always mess around , but when we do we are a mess,

  honest question : is this dutch-finnish prosperity rivalry a real thing or just a reddit circlejerk ? 
  do n't forget about reinforcing foundations for the structure, 
  it 's fabulous, 
  you do n't want to understand yourselves , that 's the problem this mentality is a basic case of troubled bully who projects his own suffering on others, 
  such as leo tolstoy or peter tchaikovsky, 
  the first thing that shows when you type ` moldova ' in google images is ` moldova poor ',
