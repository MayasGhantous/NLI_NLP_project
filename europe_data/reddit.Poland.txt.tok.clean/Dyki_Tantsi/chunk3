  it 's because portugal and greece are in western europe , even if they are the weakest link , and for years western europe was better in everything than ee ... not that suprising , but it 's more of a principle, 
  nah , calm down man , they are right - we are `` below '' them , just look at the map , we are in the south, 
  this is the question, 
  about 70 % was destroyed/damaged in ww2, 
  and wroc\u0142aw is not even in the eastern part !, 
  too bad that 's the only beautiful street in the country, 
  so ... talk -  pompous drama -  talk -  kurwa do n't push it -  let 's do this checks out, 
  i have found [ some field of flowers ] ( http://meettheslavs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/poland.jpg ) and [ this is nice too ] ( https://pumpkinskull.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/2irsne8.jpg ), 
  nah , that 's just polandball , 
  we are forsaken, 
  because the picture there is a massive clickbait the ` site ' looks just like a [ regular rock ] ( https://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-palermo/2017/01/04/125809408-8a833c32-a82f-478c-a26f-8dd52df2e129.jpg ), 
  the last sentence looks like a contradiction, 
  yeah , come on other slavs , what are you doing ? 
  maybe , but these verses are full of fapping hints, 
  godspeed , but i am waiting for a base in poland, 
  and they shall name it * kebap *, 
  [ * still more majestic shalt thou rise * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhnfvjc99yy&amp;t=2m19s ) * more * * dreadful * , * from * * each * * other * * foreign stroke * * more * * dreadful * , * dreadful * * from * * each * * other * * foreign stroke *, 
  it 's `` if it * looks * stupid , but it works , it ai n't stupid '', 
  fyi * lodz * ( \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ) is pronounced ` woodge ', 
  vodka fuels unhappiness, 
  `` europe '' , quotation marks say it all, 
  a new wallpaper , thanks !, 
  but you automatically know 4 languages , is n't it brilliant ? 
   by 2020 , the swiss army will have ** two ** f/a -18 jets ready to take off haha, 
  well , our languages sound similar , but it 's an another culture . 
  less different when compared to syrians ofc , but still . 
  and poles are n't interested much in ukraine , it 's a cultural grey zone . 
  i have a mixed feelings about that joke, 
  genetics , staying fit , but i guess having a purpose is the most important of all, 
  then pig is puking souls, 
  if the whole book is like that , then it is inadequate for their age but if it 's a caricature then it 's pretty sad agenda/message to teach kids, 
  yeah but ... this is not halal, 
  the last one looks a bit like an accordion ... for ~ ~ keb ~ ~ virus removal i presume, 
  ukrainians are flooding poland since the conflict started , studying and working here and there . 
  and it is good to see them , nice change for our homogenous society, 
  [ a warzone not so far away ] ( http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/slideshows/_production/ss-150227-donetsk-airport/ss-150227-donetsk-airport-02.nbcnews-ux-1024-900.jpg ), 
  [ lol ] ( http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/combat-ready_air-force-working-hours-to-be-discussed/38002494 ), 
  in a short term it works and looks like a good idea , but in a long term it is n't . 
  and you ca n't be sure that it wo n't scar kids . 
  anyway i think it is more of a principle to not use violence of any kind to solve problems . 
  i had hard upbringing myself , and we like to pass the idea and to project it on others ( if we suffered they need too ) we may grew up a good people , but it was * despite * beatings , not because of them, 
  right in the feels , have a hug -  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/sboak ) < -, 
  we are , and recognized both ways . 
  with romania , it is one-sided unfortunately which is funny cuz neither romanians nor hungarians are slavs . 
  i guess slavs ca n't go along, 
  and they wo n't have to pay for it , because it will be just for fun, 
  what the lol , why so high ? 
  since 1st january 2016 mein kampf licence is free . 
  who gets these money ? 
  lol yeah , either misspelling or intended ( since there is german wuerm glacier on the map ) and iceland is ` island ' in german and icelandic, 
  yeah this is a view of britain from france  view of ` white cliffs of dover ' from cap gris-nez ( france ) across the english channel , strait of dover, 
  [ this might interest you then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doggerland ) one could walk from france or denmark to britain, 
  pronunciation and spelling is absolutely nuts , but other than that it is awesome there is a reason why ` spelling bees ' are a thing in english, 
  i think this is great , even if bit repetitive . 
  this is not madness , this is europe , it is cool every nation has its perspective on it, 
  vkontakte is all warez , music , porn and putin worship . 
  the only thing that is censored is opposition to putin, 
  it is similar with slovakia from polish pov . 
  according to our media there is nothing there wait ... on this map there is nothing about slovakia too . 
  lmao it is so good !, 
  polandball in its finest, 
  usage of this word always confuses me , thanks to plentiful american influence , now it just means `` old '' . 
  one has to point out a date or specify that something is `` from antiquity '' to actually mean it . 
  agreed , but man . . your username terrifies me, 
  i fainted when i found out, 
  my first thought about this thread . 
  looks like a 98k , because it * is * 98k but one can never have too much of it . 
  but . . but . . would n't this be partially true anyway ? 
  fed up with immigrants so voting to leave ? 
  technically ... you are right . 
  vegetarian cardboard , sounds yummy . 
  lovely lol, 
  ah , the irony ... 
  where do you have new hospitals/infrastructure built with eu money with no doctors inside ? 
  eu is too divided already . . please no lol, 
  germany pays the most to the eu , which gives the most money to poorer members . 
  it is a win-win situation , even if some nationalistic feelings are hurt and brain drain is present , it is infinite times better than the alternative of not being in the eu, 
  here , have a nice word then bud, 
  my first thought was immigrants and more career-before-baby moms, 
  holy liberal lgbt roman empire, 
  * sigh *, 
  [ someone said space ? 
  well , we wanted changes and pis delivers / s, 
  hofstede was right after all !, 
  catholicism in a nutshell, 
  i came here to say ` gwiazdor ' is bullshit , but til, 
  new marketing tip : your shop ran out of free space on shelves ? 
  you want to make sure your customers notice your product ? 
  worry no more , just put it on the floor !, 
  use that precious empty space you pay rent for !, 
  bonus brand awereness if the product is alive and moving !, 
  too much kitsch . 
  guys , obvious troll is obvious, 
  exactly , corrupted regimes need symbols like that . 
  just look at nazi germany and 1936 olympics, 
  imo homework after primary schools should be banned . 
  or give pupils some projects to do after school , not this boring stuff . 
  jailing is again spending money on them and useless . 
  if they lie , deport them . 
  you are right , but funny how you were all talking about ` this is not racism ! '',
