  and now it 's priceless , best plan ever, 
  * goosebumps * but op 's photo show like the city is burning in some protest again, 
  that `` kurwa '' was so adorable,

  good job guys, 
  i like your description , but i fail to see how we turned it around, 
  there are not many , but the largest is the symbol of our capital ... 
  we should have demolished palace of science and culture by now, 
  never played etw and it brings tear to my eye too,
