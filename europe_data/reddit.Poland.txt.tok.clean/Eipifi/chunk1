yep . 
  however , the true intention of the kremlin was to minimize foreign support for anti-putin demonstrations and protests that will surely occur during the funeral . 
  we could also organize paneuropean election for the president of the european commission/council . 
  that would be a very strong mandate . 
  this is just disgusting . 
  it makes me want to puke . 
  -- * do you believe in christ ? 
  * -- * yep . 
  * -- * ok , you 're in . 
  next !, 
  * -- * hello . 
  * -- * believe in christ ? 
  next !, 
  * edit : thanks for the downvotes . 
  christian , am i right ? 
  good work neighbours , we 're not far behind you . 
  not good enough . 
  we can do more . 
  it was a fair duel . 
  congratulations , neighbours . 
  good work vladimir . 
   i will probably be the first polish foreign minister in history to say this , but here it is : ** i fear german power less than i am beginning to fear its inactivity . 
  ** you have become europe 's indispensable nation . 
  good work , neighbours . 
  carry on . 
   this means : although poland ( and other neighbouring countries ) developed a whole lot , it 's still behind the west , cause it was pretty much impossible to achieve `` western '' level of living in such a short period . 
  exactly . 
  the last 25 years is a true success story , but we still a lot of work ahead of us . 
  hahahaha ... nope . 
   sorry , but i do n't trust a finance minister which calls the credit unions a `` ponzi scheme '' . 
  well you should , because szczurek is right on this one . 
  gl\u00f6ri\u00f6us . 
  good to hear - merkel means stability . 
  i 'd vote for her if i could . 
   the proudest moment in polish history one of the saddest . 
  these people died for nothing . 
  how about no . 
  yeeeeah . 
  but he is actually quite a decent guy . 
   and it was somehow a moment i realised this is europe i want to live in my thoughts exactly . 
  who would have thought that after just 70 years , we are so close to germany . 
  not just in terms of economy / business relations , but also culture . 
  i could n't be happier . 
  here you go : http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090917002247/starwars/images/a/ab/tusken_riders_on_kenobis_street.jpg, 
  wise words . 
  any shithole fanpage can get millions of likes nowadays . 
  this is completely irrelevant . 
   so would most of the polish youth support gay marriage ? 
  especially the youth . 
   i would have thought so based on any polish i 've met here . 
  that 's nice to hear , 
  hey , slow down guys . 
  these homophobic assholes constitute a ** negligible minority ** . 
  yeeeah , tell me how powerful and thriving silesia would be if it separated from poland . 
  go be malcontent somewhere else . 
  ps : wow , over 2/3 of your posts are below 0 rating - that 's quite an achievement . 
  keep on trollin ' . 
  we 're one eu , dammit . 
  wherever we go , we 're home . 
  my point exactly . 
  the sooner we join the eurozone , the better for all of us . 
  oh no , my friend - eurozone is the only way to keep up with the rest of the eu - shared currency is exactly what we need to keep our companies competitive in the common market . 
  besides , nowadays it 's also about security - look at ukraine . 
  military alliances are far stronger if members protect common interests , and not just common values . 
  same for us in poland . 
  sadly , our new president will probably block any attempts to join the eurozone . 
  glorious, 
   uuuuu ... the evil system . 
  go fearmongering to the nearest classroom , perhaps there it will work . 
  grab my upvote , we need more people like you . 
  balcerowicz is the main reason why i would support petru 's party . 
  he is exactly the person we need right now . 
  see any better solution ? 
  how about the nationalist pislamic caliphate ? 
  po is a lost case , i agree . 
  in my opinion , the solution is ryszard petru . 
  he will probably anounce a new party in a few weeks , provided that komorowski wins - if duda becomes president , he will veto each end every legislation that goes past sejm . 
  yay , nato was just friendzoned . 
  ok , just be careful . 
  finland , just to remind you , nato would welcome you as a member . 
  crap , not again ... 
  great idea , subbed . 
  what the fuck, 
  thank you . 
  that 's how you do it . 
  or even better : lose a war with usa , then rebuild everything with their help . 
  examples : * germany * japan * south korea ps : maybe this is kim jong 's plan ... 
  100 % would prefer integration with germans rather than ~ ~ soviet occupation ~ ~ `` brotherly russian help '' . 
  travel more . 
  there 's so much to see . 
  amen to that . 
  [ better version ] ( https://youtu.be/-kcopym9cbg?t=7m19s ), 
  they are weak . 
  * one putin to rule them all , one putin to find them , * * one putin to conquer them all and in neo-sovietism bind them * * in the land of russia , where shadows lie . 
  your post genuinely makes me feel safe . 
  i wish i could upvote you more than once , friend . 
  crap , not again, 
  austria looks glorious . 
  ca n't upvote enough ... 
  putin threatens the world with ww3 .
