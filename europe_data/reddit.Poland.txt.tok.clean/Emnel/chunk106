  same goes for many local branches in even highly sophisticated fields . 
  my brother works as an accountant for one of the biggest global banks and they usually have between 4 and 6 people doing 10 men ' jobs . 
  i really wish that claims of business planning to relocate or reduce employment were treated to * some * scrutiny . 
  not much , not even little . 
  just ** some ** . 
  not a single minimal wage increase in recent history led to an unemployment rise . 
  no big factory in central europe has been closed due to increased pay . 
  and why would it ? 
  slovakian workers will go from being paid ~ 25 % of what germans are for the same job , to ~ 30 % . 
  in two years no less . 
  and yet every single time anything that can be counted as good for working people happens a gaggle of half-conscious cassandras appears prophesying economic apocalypse just over the horizon . 
  while those are indeed real issues there are also upsides such as enough space for trees and grass along some of the roads as well as bike lanes and , above all , tram tracks 100 % separate from normal traffic lanes . 
  with recent renovations they 're even being adjusted as lanes for emergency vehicles in case of congestion . 
  if only we were as enthralled with this tradition as we are with various wars and battles . 
  have n't heard that , but there was a bombing in wroc\u0142aw by a right-wing domestic terrorist and apparently there has been a car bomb under a police car in warsaw . 
  people have been looking into what uk is made of more and more those last few weeks and alarmingly often the answer is `` poorly painted plywood '' .

  i think the point is that it looks sloppy , which it does . 
  they 'll try , but if things continue the way they have for the last few weeks it will only get worse . 
  police cuts issue put a real spotlight on how much of a `` plywood country '' uk has become after decades of dismantling regulations and services . 
  it may look impressive from a distance , but the moment you nudge it a little , or a stronger gust of wind hits the whole facade collapses revealing nothingness behind . 
  yesterdays fire seems to be the same thing all over again and more and more people will start to take notice . 
  few more episodes like that and the whole neoliberal world view may start crumbling along with the tories . 
  we 've accepted many times more than the current share from chechnya over last 20 years and it have n't changed shit . 
  you 'd need to accept an awful lot for it to make an actual difference in a country of 36 millions . 
  you 're referring to something from 20 years ago . 
  also , the jordan-israeli conflict is one thing , but their stance on isis is definitely a whole different story . 
  they 've been a target of attacks and they retaliated against the isis several times . 
  wow . 
  now i 'm even more confused why she is n't portrayed with her head up her own ass . 
  what would that be ? 
  the main legal or semi-legal way of doing this is influencing the government to do their bidding and telling the rest what you just wrote - that it ca n't be done . 
  no more no less . 
  you 'd be amazed what a state can achieve , if it put its mind to it . 
  have n't they missed their mark by one island the the left then ? 
  i must admit that i 've literally never heard of them before this election night . 
  unless you meant just people in the uk . 
  wow , i 'm not jealous of your social media bubble . 
  i do n't think i know a single serious trump supporter , perhaps some that would reluctantly pick him over clinton as a way of kicking the neoliberal establishment in the ass , but that 's it . 
   and the left just parrots other foreign media . 
  fuck off mate . 
  the way we and increasing amount of people see it , he 's just another nail in the coffin of the fantasy us allaince was . 
  until now republican presidencies , while being terrible overall had a mitigating factor of being a counterweight to the putin regime 's ambitions in the region . 
   the whole russia thingy , surprisingly , does n't really cause much distress here . 
  that 's because our right wing politicians and pundits are so demented that they value sticking it to the `` socialists '' and `` homosexuals '' in the us and eu more , than the actual safety of the country . 
  all of that went a bit under the radar so far , but this visit should be an amazing opportunity to shed a light on monumental stupidity of both the polish right and trump itself . 
  i 'm only worried that they 'll used that opportunity to sign some moronic deals and make us may 200 + % for some military hardware as well as reaffirm that they 'd rather get on their knees before trump than deal with our security issues by pushing for a real eu army . 
  i think he meant drowning himself in a drainage ditch . 
  honestly i hardly ever see reddit call czechia czech republic anymore . 
  and since where reddit goes rest of the world surely follows i can only imagine that becoming a norm by the end of the week ( + / - few years ) . 
  right , because rise negotiations with one 's boss is such an apt representation of what brexit talks are . 
  apples to apples really . 
  i 'm truly humbled by the depth of your analysis . 
  so saying `` we 'd rather reach a deal than have those negotiations fall apart . '', 
  is a `` conceding in negotiations '' now ? 
  you daft ? 
  what 's up with that bit of danish waters north of our western coast ? 
  while negotiating with corbyn surely would n't be a walk in the park either , he 'd at least focus on actual issues , rather than play political games with peoples ' lives . 
  but when you boil it down it amounts to more or less the same shit . 
  ops . 
  right , us is such a reliable ally . 
  for now we just buy their shit ( such as shitty helicopters ) and do their dirty work . 
  betting on us over eu was already moronic a decade ago , but now it 's just raving madness . 
  overreacting much ? 
  if we really have to look at it in terms of possible negative effects on our economy the only industries that would have a problem with that are kinds that routinely send employees abroad , such as transport industry . 
  besides that the reform would prevent corporate abuses such as employing workers in poland for polish wages to ship them to germany to work there without the protection of local law . 
  it would be a small , but a fairly important step towards balancing eu wages . 
  but of course our government ( as well as most of the opposition ) does n't have any idea for developing polish economy beyond keeping us as a bangladesh of europe . 
  do you really think that this is the time and the place for such [ unabashed , vicious attack on polish catholic church ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=ko%c5%9bci%c3%b3%c5%82+nowoczesny&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjdtvzy4qnuahvlypokhburcf0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=916 ) ? 
  this is an important color for islam . 
  if only our fuckwit government was so assertive when it came to sending troops to iraq or hosting cia black sites !, 
  all the while 2 right-wing psychos are being trialed for a bombing in a city bus and quadruple murder of `` enemies of the fatherland '' , but it 's not the government 's xenophobic propaganda , but few 1000s middle eastern refugees that are a real threat . 
  it 's like they 're trying to lose the election . 
  exactly !, 
  i see doze ... ah , heck it ... hundreds of them buying such things every day !, 
  usually holding an avocado toast in each hand . 
  only very small parts of lusatia are within czech and polish borders , so the population here is around 1000-5000 to around 60000 in germany . 
  here is the website of [ polish sorbian ngo ] ( http://prolusatia.pl/ ) if you feel like google-translating some things . 
  banter and memefare is strong in this one . 
  and this is [ what main hall looks like ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/20070206_uw_buw_hall_glowny_biblioteki.jpg/800px-20070206_uw_buw_hall_glowny_biblioteki.jpg ) . 
  i 'd imagine that similarly to the previously possible melenchon victory it may both signalize and precipitate political shift to the left after decades of neoliberalism . 
  perhaps on eu scale . 
  uk being out of eu may not have a such a direct economic impact , but its overall influence do to language supremacy is not insignificant . 
  really ? 
  pkk are `` literally stalin '' now ? 
  as if foreign politics were the only important issue . 
  if labour wins with their current program and starts implementing it that would mean that uk would go from having one of the most neoliberal governments in europe to one of most if not the most left wing one . 
  that alone could have a very significant effect on british , european and even world economy and politics .
