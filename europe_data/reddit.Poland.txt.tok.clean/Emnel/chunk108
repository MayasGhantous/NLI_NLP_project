  some of them see the change as a continuous motion that will just keep getting more and more unfair . 
  either from genuine fear , anger for being blamed for something they never were part of or indeed actual vile backwardness they get radicalized as a group despite only a minority previously identifying with that backward shit and lash out . 
  that in turn creates the similar reaction from the radical elements of the issue on the `` progressive '' side and things just escalate from there . 
  the vast majority of reactionaries do n't have the historical context of the issue and are shocked why in light of obvious balance in current injustice they get jumped on by the mainstream while their radical opponents get a free pass . 
  that radicalizes them even more and tons of people who never before cared for any of those things are suddenly adamant supporters of some borderline medieval worldview by little fault of their own . 
  most of them just were n't equipped with the knowledge to see the bigger picture and got caught between deplorable characters feeding them bullshit and mainstream who did n't bother to try to talk to them before spitting in their face and leaving them as food for demagogues . 
  sad thing is that if both sides just chilled the fuck out for a few years the pendulum would stop around its resting position and everyone would have both more free time and less hatred in their lives . 
  \\* in the lightest possible term in this utterly meaningless matter of video game/tv show portrayal ) . 
  they can be detained , but not tried . 
  has nothing to do with the inaction you see there . 
  probably just poorly trained , as it usually is in the us with their 1000 different police standards . 
  one time when some of that police brutality us is know for would be useful and they 're mostly running around like headless chickens . 
  and conchita wurst as yen . 
  obviously . 
  it would be amazing !, 
  how can you beat great actor and tasty right-wing tears ? 
  of course it is . 
  that is an outright treason !, 
  long tradition of voting for your neighbors have been desecrated !, 
  that 's what jp2 monument is for . 
  it works well till you play with south africans ... 
  no , not really . 
  i 'd be the first one to launch waszczykowski and his clown car of an administration into orbit , but this is ridiculous . 
  sure , you could nitpick here and there , but 90 % of the criticism of this letter is outright stupid . 
  also , this is meant for * the french * . 
  if you ever had any professional contacts with the french that involved communication in english , you 'd know that this is basically shakespearian compared to what is considered `` ok '' there . 
  yeah , i figured it does n't mean what it means in english . 
  i for one always refer to militant groups i politically associate with as `` militant '' in party communication . 
  i think you took a wrong turn . 
  to get to the_dimwits move back for about 100 years and then take a sharp turn to the right . 
  i wonder if recent support for macron by varoufakis has been a factor in convincing some of the left to not abstain . 
  i have to say that his claim that macron is n't just a next run-of-the-mill neoliberal stooge and that his left-wing claims may actually be genuine would probably convince me to cast a reluctant vote . 
  what a time to be alive !, 
  very impressive . 
  thanks a lot netherlands !, 
  well , i could try explaining how may 1st has very little to do with stalinist regimes , and is about fighting for worker 's rights . 
  i could argue that exploitation of workers and unchecked privileges of capital are an important and growing issue both in poland and worldwide , but you seem hellbent on rushing to outright silly conclusions with an ignorance worthy of the regime you claim to be so against . 
  i just came back from a labor day march , so get lost fam . 
  i think that french claiming the very same thing about parisians is n't helping the case . 
  well , if the outcome and conclusions from the vrbanja battle are anything to go by it was a tragedy that they were n't . 
  those people might have still been alive . 
  i always had a problem with that assumption . 
  it stipulates that bosnian serbs were willing to gamble an outright attack on un forces risking a counterattack or in case of inflicting serious casualties a western intervention . 
  throughout the whole conflict there has been some incidents of firing at un convoys but till srebrenica there has been only one instance of an actual skirmish involving both sides https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vrbanja_bridge serbs had no way of knowing what kind of support dutch can expect and had they been challenged they very well could have backed off . 
  the idea what all of the dutch forces would have been murdered if they where outmatched in confrontation and forced to surrender is outright absurd . 
  yes there would have been danger involved in starting an armed confrontation with the serbs , but that 's in their bloody job description . 
  if commander was so concerned about the safety of his man he could have simply order to surrender as soon as the situation would be getting out of hand . 
  i really do n't think that their guilt is unjustified or that accusations against the command of the unit are unfounded . 
  and while i do have compassion for their current situation and do n't want them to be prosecuted beyond what already has been done ( especially since most of the blame is on their superiors ) i do think that claiming that it 's simply ok and by the book for a military unit to give up civilians to the slaughter would be an act of madness . 
  because yes , there * was * quite a lot they could have done . 
   tampon stealing russians that should become a thing . 
  it already has been done in this thread . 
  whole index is only applicable if you 're a venture capitalist , save the part about rule of law ( and even there the corruption bit is kinda shit ) . 
  thing is that modern liberalism is a very bastardized version of smith 's thought . 
  in many ways goes outright against his views , especially when it comes to government-business relations . 
  smith advocated government regulation over businesses , pointed out that what 's good for them is usually bad for the state and society as a whole and thus their influence over governance and lawmaking should be avoided . 
  he also recognized that business is prone to oppression and fraud against the society . 
  postulated progressive taxation as well . 
  if you 're interested in the subject i 'd suggest to at least skim through the wealth of nations . 
  it is 80 % ramblings about contemporary things that are outright meaningless now , but there are interesting bits as well . 
  and the famous `` invisible hand '' appears only once and the way it is cited these days is quite warped . 
  edit : i went ahead and actually found one of such quotes in the summary part of the book 1 . 
  ( that `` order '' he refers to are entrepreneurs )  the proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to withgreat precaution , and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined , not only with the most scrupulous , but with the most suspicious attention . 
  it comes from an order of men whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public , who have generally an in - terest to deceive and even to oppress the public , and who accordingly have , upon many occasions , both deceived and oppressed it . 
  tax havens . 
  ideal nation according to this index is a country with not taxes , labor or business or safety regulations , but somehow a functional government . 
  it 's hardly an outright higher = better index tho . 
  it 's made of several scores with only some being unequivocally positive the higher they are : ** rule of law **  property rights :  degree of a country 's legal protection of private property rights , degree of enforcement of those laws , independence of and corruption within the judiciary , and likelihood of expropriation . 
  -  freedom from corruption :  the non-prevalence of political corruption within a country , according to the corruption perceptions index . 
  ** limited government **  fiscal freedom :  how free is a country from tax burden . 
  it comprises three quantitative measures : top marginal tax rate of both individual and corporate income , and total tax burden as a percentage of gdp . 
  -  government size/spending :  governments ' expenditures as a percentage of gdp , including consumption and transfers . 
  the higher the percentual spending , the lower the score . 
  ** regulatory efficiency **  business freedom :  a country 's freedom from the burden of regulations on starting , operating , and closing business , given factors such as time , cost and number of procedures , as well as the efficiency of government in the regulatory process . 
  -  labor freedom :  how free is a country from legal regulation on the labor market , including those relating to minimum wages , hiring and firing , hours of work and severance requirements . 
  -  monetary freedom :  how free from microeconomic intervention and price instability is a country , basing on an equation considering the weighted average inflation rate in the last three years and price controls . 
  ** open markets **  trade freedom :  freedom from sizeable numbers and burdens of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to imports and exports of a country . 
  -  investment freedom :  freedom from restrictions on the movement and use of investment capital , regardless of activity , within and across the country 's borders . 
  -  financial freedom :  a country 's independence from government control and interference in the financial sector , including banks . 
  it considers government ownership of financial firms , extent of financial and capital market development , government influence on the allocation of credit and openness to foreign competition . 
  -- if you 're a hardcore neoliberal then sure , everything is better the higher it is , but except `` rule of law '' bit that is pretty obvious the rest is just : less regulation = better . 
  i 'm pretty sure few would like to be # 1 in financial , labor , fiscal or business `` freedom '' . 
  edit : for example [ somalia ] ( http://www.heritage.org/index/country/somalia ) ranks well above what we 'd call a developed world in : fiscal freedom : 100/100 business freedom 92.3 / 100 labor freedom 91.8 / 100 they would actually rank much , much higher in the index even with little to no rule of law points , if ranking creators did n't arbitrarily gave them no score in other areas , in many of which they 'd score equally well , given the definitions . 
  and by `` labor freedom '' the index means `` freedom to exploit your labor force '', 
  thanks for the title , i 'll take a look . 
  i 'm not particularly well read in the subject , but my understanding was that they at least had very little central coordination when it came to designing of aircraft , tanks and so on . 
  they 'd for example commission a fighter and few companies would design their own machines even to the point of building usable prototypes fighting for the same contract . 
  that seems very wasteful and in a very stark contrast to very centralized soviet system . 
  same goes for actual manufacturing process - leaving it in hands of businesses rather than attempting to centrally optimize production chains . 
  that in turn may be linked to famous lack of frontline repair capability for aircrafts . 
  there are multiple reports of both soviet and western forces capturing airfields full of lightly or moderately damaged craft that was waiting to be sent back to germany for repairs that allied airforces were routinely doing in situ . 
  another thing that gets mentioned a lot is not conscripting women to work in the industry unlike all the other nations and instead using slave labor , that came with its own issues such as sabotage of already overdesigned and breakdown-prone machines . 
  all in all i 'd agree that you can call pre-war state of german economy a `` war economy '' , but the term is quite open-ended and it does seem to me that the level of commitment by germany in that regard ( both in terms of resources , workforce and planning/thought ) was nowhere near what allied nations had been doing . 
  especially in comparison to soviet union . 
  which would make the book correct , but only `` technically correct '' and / r/thewimsey point would more-or-less stand . 
  one day polan will into gay too :(, 
  9 years younger , according to wikipedia . 
  we actually tried that in poland . 
  resulted in unlivable wages , primitivization of economy that got hooked on cheap labor , massive brain drain , loss of pension/healthcare `` tax '' revenue that was included in standard labor contracts , underfunding of public services ( since due to related policies profits have been funneled tax free abroad ) and eventually in right-wing populist victory . 
  2/10 would n't recommend .
