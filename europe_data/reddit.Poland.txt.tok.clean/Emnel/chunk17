  most are either worthless oneliners or occasional legitimate thought by serial trolls that gets simply thrown under the bus based on their track record . 
  i assume that the guy above is just a troll . 
  still , i do n't know how not voicing an opinion in someones face makes it less valid . 
  without providing your adress too !, 
  you surely mean mork ( or possibly gork ) . 
  it 's obviously europe who worships chaos gods . 
  mostly slaanesh . 
  klose 's grandparents had german citizenship before wwii since they were members of polish minority in german silesia , so they got citizenship based on the same german legislation , but it had nothing to do with deal with gorbachev . 
  fun fact : he tried to play in polish national team 1st , but our brilliant football officials have n't considered him promising enough . 
   if that is not happening , it is not genocide . 
  if the exact opposite of that is happening , it is not genocide . 
  is your point `` its ok to kill few thousands since they are breeding like rats '' ? 
  or you are only arguing that israel created a perfect environment for palestinians to thrive and therefore their population has risen ? 
  you really do n't have to wait for 100.000 dead to call actions like that genocidal when governemnt officials make [ claims like this ] ( http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/israeli-lawmakers-call-genocide-palestinians-gets-thousands-facebook-likes ) . 
  ( pardon shitty site ), 
  apartheid is a much better word for it . 
  or at least was before they started murdering civilians by thousands with prominent politicians in israeli coalition government calling for killing all the palestinians . 
  i 'd say that this is as close as you can get to genocide without having mass executions on the streets . 
  not sure about situation in ukraine getting better compared to 2013 ... 
  if i were to describe this book and her philosophy i 'd say that it 's something you 'd get by forcing 5yo to read all works of nietzsche and then make him write 1000 pages about it . 
  it 's just awful . 
  and literally worst book i 've read in last decade . 
  before reading it i always assumed that there is some kind of deeper thought behind whole neo-liberal movement . 
  not the case . 
   you people do n't even know what 's in the deal and you already have your mind set on that it 's evil incarnate . 
  is n't that the proper way to go about it ? 
  ca n't see how assuming the worst till proven otherwise can be harmful in this case . 
  when even liberals are against a free trade agreement you know it 's time to run for the hills . 
  they do n't want to be kicked out of wto . 
  idk , i thought that kaczynski is the worst eu country can get , but when you compare him to orban , he seems quite moderate ... and kaczynski 's party lost next 9 elections after being in power , while orban seems unopposed . 
  unless you are in your late 80s i ca n't see how you personally can be responsible for that . 
  or maybe he is a concerned hungarian citizen who does n't like the road his country is taking ? 
  and that 's probably the only upside to the whole situation . 
  probably about the time i get a compensation for having you as a compatriot . 
  i 've already known it all , but today reading a piece in a paper about german pacification of the uprising it made me sick to my stomach . 
  almost 200.000 civilians murdered . 
  man , women and children , mostly being dragged out of homes , schools , hospitals and killed on the streets in mass executions . 
  district by district . 
  he is actually considered very uk friendly , just fed up with cameron 's shit . 
  this guy . 
  like a gift that keeps giving !, 
  huh . 
  i never knew that penis enlargement was the real thing , existing beyond an e-mail spam . 
  it sure sounds like a perfectly normal thing to do . 
  pm says that he will step down unless parliament supports his proposals . 
  parliament supports said proposals , pm stays . 
  why not go with ** `` armed invasion of finland by norway !, 
  is this the end of the world as we know it ? 
  both , with a taste of [ yalta conference ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yalta_conference ) ( no-nato bit ) . 
  it 's like 3 greatest hits in one !, 
  i sure hope you are right . 
  i can only imagine all the hell that would brake loose here in poland if something like that got even proposed by merkel . 
  it would make times of schr\u00f6der look like minor inconvenience and most likely make kaczynski win next elections on top of returning polish-german relations to the state if was ~ 40 years ago or so . 
  i really hope merkel is n't that clueless . 
  whole article seems yanked out of author 's ass , but if those proposals are true it would mean losing at least 30-40 years of development of polish - german relations . 
  it 's like some kind of `` how many nerves can we strike and how many polish strategic interests can we damage '' contest . 
  ridiculous . 
  there is shitloads of other fruit being produced too , just a lot of apples as well . 
  i 'd argue that compared to us or uk we are a beacon of civilisation in that department . 
  especially taking into account the speed government backpedalled on the challenged provisions . 
  also how many years old i was when i was 12 . 
   poles are never ones for privacy . 
  how come ? 
  what 's mlp ? 
  i know nothing about twitter . 
  funny enough people started campaign #eatapples ( pol . 
  #jedzjablka ) on facebook and twitter  [ here in front of russian embassy :d ] ( https://twitter.com/goralewskim/status/494420829082775553/photo/1 ), 
  as expected . 
  it is surely going much faster than anyone expected a decade ago or so . 
  very nice . 
  law was challenged by ombudsman office ( pol : rzecznik praw obywatelskich rpo , advocate for citizens ' rights ) after supreme audit office reported that scope of the right to monitor citizens was n't properly specified . 
  government was given 18 months to change unconstitutional provisions . 
  both government and prosecutor general have already agreed with rpo in 2013 . 
  pm claimed that law was written with only fighting `` serious crime '' in mind , and that legislative work to limit the scope of state services right are already underway .

  and male underwear models ? 
  what is even your point ? 
  `` seriously ? '', 
  was aimed at op . 
  my point was `` how is that newsworthy , yet alone europe-wise newsworthy ? '' . 
  guess i should have been more clear . 
  huh ? 
  seriously ? 
  on one hand [ melody is great ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:mazurek_dabrowskiego.ogg ) . 
  original and powerful , gets your blood pumping ( the way anthem , in my opinion , should be ) . 
  you can also pretty much yell it without butchering it and that helps with the whole uplifting phenomenon . 
  but [ lyrics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland_is_not_yet_lost ) are pretty much obsolete , since they refer to the political situation in 1797 . 
  it 's about polish legions in italy under napoleon . 
  translation :  poland has not yet died ,  so long as we still live . 
   what the alien power has seized from us ,  we shall retrieve with a sabre . 
  clearly there is no need to retrieve anything with a sabre anymore . 
  fun fact : melody was later used to create [ pan-slavic anthem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hey,_slavs ) that used to be an anthem of yugoslavia , slovakia as well as serbia and montenegro . 
  it will hardly affect anyone , so i doubt poles in uk care , beyond being pissed of on scapegoating itself . 
  it 's clearly a gesture towards more xenophobic voters . 
  harmless in itself , but the fact that it was considered politically beneficial to do that is a bit troubling . 
  that explains a lot . 
  i assume he 's just constantly being laughed at whenever he opens his mouth . 
  tragic story , really . 
  i only found numbers for publishers and agora was on top . 
  there were some war-like , but even then i have n't seen any arguing that we should all invade russia or something .
