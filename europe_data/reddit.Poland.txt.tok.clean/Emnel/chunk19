  i feel convinced now !, 
  have you read 2nd part of what i wrote ? 
  that 's the main point . 
  there are n't prosecuted germans in eastern prussia now . 
  dumbest because what i said in other comment to your 1st answer about 2 minutes before this one . 
  my opinion would be the same if you 'd advocate returning parts of today 's ukraine and belarus to poland or anything else that happened after ww2 . 
   please do n't take any comments of mine downplaying anything bad that has happened to poland i have n't . 
  i literally at first understood it as being about old prussians , but then in context realised that german citizens of region of prussia may fit better here . 
  so i simply asked what you had on your mind . 
  i had no politics in mind , just an honest question . 
  have n't realised that it may be understood as some kind of passive-aggressive statement . 
  one is an effect of a biggest war in history and part of much bigger border redrawing affecting dozens of countries on top of being done 70 years ago . 
  the other is a part of ethnic cleansing happening as we speak . 
  it is not even about giving up the land but about treating conquered inhabitants of it as 2nd class human beings and everything else that goes with it . 
  or rather is an effect of one . 
  dumbest analogy i 've seen whole week . 
  and it 's sunday . 
  you mean original ones or german ones ? 
  that 's not even weird . 
  polish name for female inhabitant of constantinopole is * konstantynopolita\u0144czykowianeczka * ^ ^, 
  i guess it may be considered offensive by some but i ca n't really see it that way . 
  and knowing soviet architecture todays konigsberg can only benefit from it . 
  ` fun ' fact : [ warsaw old town ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_old_town ) is 100 % rebuilt and based on pre-ww2 photographs after it being completely destroyed along with the rest of the city during warsaw uprising in 1944 . 
  looks pretty well , so it can be done . 
  and before that germans took the land and the city from prussians who took it from slavs , who took it from goths , who took it from ... you get the idea . 
  why would you ? 
  just like italian frittata . 
  [ w\u0119dliny ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eh1pkbuazgw/tpbo40tsb8i/aaaaaaaabwe/rn0tw-bhsws/s1600/pict0167.jpg ) made the old-fashioned way ( not the mass , cheap ones from supermarkets ) . 
  i can confirm he 's not a pole and therefore obeys rules of the thread !, 
  making so many grammatical mistakes in sentence this long is n't an easy feat :d, 
  lol are you sure it is n't dunkirk after a few days bombardment ? 
  we did back in xiv and xv century . 
  whole polish-hungarian brotherhood dates back to spring of nations and polish generals leading in the hungarian rebellion . 
  and that 's not cool , or something ? 
  or simply an observation ? 
  truth is we all love you guys very much , we just keep it private , since you 'd probably assume we are about to emigrate or something . 
  that 's my story and i 'm sticking to it . 
  what 's up with germans , netherlands , beaches and holes . 
  this is like 3rd time i hear this combination . 
  what is it reference to ? 
  some would argue that serbs like serbs a tad too much for their own ( and others ) good . 
  i pretty much like all the europe , but for the benefit of the thread let me try to make few honourable mentions : ** italy ** - i 'm historian specialising in ancient history and especially rome . 
  i lived there for few months pretty much sightseeing in every spare moment . 
  at some point i plan to move there for few more years . 
  i love the climate , food ( fruits are godlike !, 
  ) , relaxed attitude , architecture etc. 
  i chose to ignore religiousness , political choices and lack of interest in the world  ** germany ** - i respect the amount of work they put into fighting nationalistic tendencies . 
  great example for the rest of the continet ( and the world ) ** scandinavia ** - for not buying into pure capitalism fairytale and doing their thing . 
  ** czechy ** - for being less into grand ideas and more into living and letting live than average nation . 
  ** croatia ** - all the benefits of balkans but with more coastline and less genocidal tendencies . 
  ** turkey ** - for all the effort put into making peaceful , secular state on muslim and imperialist root . 
  please do n't fuck it up . 
  ** hungary ** - since i 'm kinda programmed to . 
  rise of the far-right saddens me deeply . 
  on iconographic or your dumb comment ? 
  yeah , i 'm sure only poles were downvoting it . 
  there is clearly nothing wrong with it and rampant nationalism is the only explanation why someone disagrees with it !, 
  seriously ... 
  it is especially bs when people try to pin down an ethnicity of pre-modern figures like copernicus or mickiewicz using modern criteria . 
  only thing people at the time identify themselves with were states . 
  not nations . 
  and since states were mostly multinational arguing that for example mickiewicz was only polish ( or only lithuanian ) is plain stupid and historically absurd . 
  as far as early xx century censuses go , we always have to assume some bias towards the primary nationality of the state ( even when methodology is solid ) simply due to nationalistic ideologies running high among the people , so also among ones who performed said census . 
  ergo there were probably at least a bit more people identifying themselves as lithuanians in ii rp than data shows . 
  we can safely assume that besides few border regions that were part of plebiscites back in 1918 it was close to 100 % . 
  here is one for ostprussen that i managed to find : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2buz5d/ethnic_map_of_eastern_prussia_1907/, 
   it may be an interesting subject of a historical debate hardly , since data is quite obvious . 
  bits of germany that are n't included on the map and are now in poland were close to 100 % german . 
  never heard anyone debating it . 
   will undoubtedly lead to accusation of revisionism from the polish side from few morons ? 
  maybe , surely not from 99.5 % of the poles . 
  you think that we tell ourselves that stettin was polish city or something ? 
  where are you from , again ? 
   this forum simply does not allow a thorough historical debate and there is nothing worse than using a one-sided and popular historical interpretation for distorting current political debate . 
  yeah , let 's just all assume that poles would smother that debate from the start making up crazy stories . 
  like the one about poles making up crazy stories . 
   besides , it still has n't been pointed out ( not even suggested in the op ) what the precise significance of this is supposed to be . 
  precise significance of it is being a possibly interesting piece of an old map . 
  before ww2 poland was always a multinational state with sizable jewish and german ( in cities , all immigrants ) , lithuanian , byelorussian and ukrainian ( in eastern parts ) populations . 
  those people were mostly every bit as loyal citizens as polish speaking ones . 
  for hundreds of years polish infantry was was largely made of german and scottish immigrants , for example . 
  people should really stop trying to use xx century ideologies when trying to understand pre-modern states . 
   reality that many poles fail to address , indeed maps including % of all nationalities in ii rp ( interbellum ) are in every history textbook starting with elementary school ones . 
  i do n't think this is any kindof tabu or pandora box . 
  i can post one like that later when i get home . 
  but even on this one is kinda obvious - one has to assume that for some regions ( like north-western border ones ) you simply subtract number on the map from 100 and you get % of german citizens . 
  for bits that were in germany at the time those % s quickly get very close to 100 when you get further from border . 
  i never heard anyone argue that for example stettin was n't fully german city at the time . 
  if you would try to think for a sec you 'd probably figure that in some areas you can simply figure that out by subtracting the number on the map from 100 . 
  but naaaah , better spew nonsense on the internet . 
  not really . 
  it was like that for few hundred years between brandenburg and prussia ( that despite being subject of poland was almost exclusively german-speaking region ) . 
  as far as us media go i limit myself to daily show , that new john oliver thing and some colbert . 
  works wonders for my sanity . 
  with extended magazines too . 
  in case more eggs come and fight back , obviously . 
  every country gets red army invasion it deserves . 
  hell , even australia made it to the front pages in that department . 
  anti-canadian bias is a real problem that , like canada itself , goes unnoticed . 
   bumfuckistan really ?
