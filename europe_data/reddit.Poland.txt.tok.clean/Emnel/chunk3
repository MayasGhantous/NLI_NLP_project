  it 's just easy for young people to gloss over those and only remember bits that make them feel nice . 
  they get used to this moral superiority to such extent , that it is hard for them to consider other possibility . 
  despite technically being thought about it all at some point in time . 
  more [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2k6q2d/dear_polish_football_fans_are_you_serious_we_want/clj0kc8 ) , since i 'm starting to repeat myself anyway . 
  you actually will learn about all the bad stuff we did in polish schools . 
  \u017beligowski 's incident , invasion of czechoslovakia , mistreatment of cossacks , akcja `` wis\u0142a '' , jedwabne etc. 
  it 's all there . 
  described and explained the same way good parts of our history are . 
  thing is that young mind does n't want to acknowledge that the same way it acknowledges the good parts . 
  things like that ca n't be glossed over or simply mentioned . 
  students need to be engaged in discussion about them , to think about them or they 'll simply forget focusing on things that make them feel nice and fuzzy inside . 
  especially when media are n't really helping with some only pointing at good parts while others , in an attempt to counterbalance , go too far the other way presenting those bad pages of history in un-nuanced and simplified way that alienates younger audience instead of easing them in and making them think . 
  also history schoolbook is 30 % author and 70 % some lower ministry of education bureaucrat , believe it or not . 
  i have heard one of the top ancient history professors in the country using words like `` pierdolona bezm\u00f3zga biurwa '' when describing his encounters with that institution on that matter . 
  that 's actually not true . 
  you must have missed dozens of lessons if you do n't remember that since there was a lot of analyzing of i rp collapse during my years in school . 
  wow - this is amazing !, 
  football fans are morons . 
  what can you do ? 
  we are 2nd right after mecca of all out-of-eu immigrants - uk . 
  interesting . 
  or borders of a land owned by some duke . 
  party was formed in 1895 , so that 's exactly how it 's called . 
  ( kinda ), 
  it 's actually quite interesting !, 
  euro is pronaunced [ like this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/pl-euro.ogg#pl ) . 
  it is also one of the very few non-declinable words in polish . 
  for example z\u0142oty is used like this ( using latin [ declination ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_grammar#adjectives ) names , to makes things easier to understand ) : singular/plural n. z\u0142oty / z\u0142ote g. z\u0142otego / z\u0142otych d. z\u0142otemu / z\u0142otym acc . 
  , while euro just has `` euro '' all around . 
  and people are saying that polish is hard or w/e . 
  ca n't you just pay with your card or withdraw a local currency from the cash machine ? 
  bank rates are usually quite reasonable , so that 's what i do when i 'm abroad . 
  thing is that we do n't want euro now because it is a mess . 
  we will likely come around once it 's all sorted . 
  yeah , thats one of the downsides , but on the other hand i 'd rather see euro zone getting it 's shit togather before we join . 
  you should probably stick to english since i doubt that lack of '' [ filtr ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?newwindow=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=fbd&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3aen-gb%3aofficial&amp;channel=sb&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=740&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=filtr&amp;oq=filtr&amp;gs_l=img.12...0.0.0.4901280.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..56.img..0.0.0.b0zwtjj-rae ) '' is as big of a polish issue as you make it to be  and i 'd argue that it 's more of an oversensitivity issue rather than our inability to `` understand english subtility '' . 
  i had bad feeling about this from the start ... press in poland is ripping him a new one right now , and rightfully so . 
  anyone who thinks that lw\u00f3w should be somehow returned to poland is an utter moron . 
  i ca n't imagine that not going horribly , horribly wrong for everyone involved . 
  but then again - revanchists are n't known for their intelligence . 
  how is it a double standard when both names are said in the same language ? 
  looking for insults where there are none , are we ? 
  or half a beer if you want a pricy one . 
  less if we are talking bar prices . 
  that kinda makes you guys look like a yugoslavia 's ballsack ... 
  we would have to be a very special kind of stupid to accept this kind of offer . 
  for too many reason for me to list at this late hour . 
  i ca n't seriously imagine any upside for poland in that . 
  nothing . 
  i sure hope it was some kind of verbal provocation , because if putin thinks that something like that can be taken seriously , he has even less ties with reality than i thought . 
   last thing i want is to cooperate with commies . 
  commies ? 
  time to leave the trenches man !, 
  what you see in russia is nationalism if anything . 
  last opinion poll on the matter , that i 've managed found puts people who think that was a coup at 26 % ( with 11 % being `` sure '' about it ) . 
  there is no evidence supporting that theory , tho . 
  that awkward moment when kaczy\u0144ski is right about something ... 
  in poland , as it turns out , those 3 % are mostly in old communal buildings having one toilet/floor on the staircase . 
  i remember not being able wrap my head around that 3 % 21 % and 34 % ? 
  that 's just crazy !, 
   recent * really ? 
  you just decided to like yourselves so much to make up for the rest of the world , have n't you ? 
  we care about orban a lot , in poland . 
  in similar manner as on this subreddit , actually . 
  it would actually be quite funny if they 'd turn out to be us spies . 
  russians are so cliche at this point . 
  as if `` we do n't give a single fuck about eachother '' ? 
  [ `` the parade '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defilada ) is a hell of a movie , but that 's about it when it comes to polish-nkorean relations . 
  that was my point , was n't it ? 
  that catholic church influence risen during communist ear due to it 's support for the opposition . 
  by `` recently '' i meant last 3-4 decades so . 
  heavy catholic influence in polish politics is quite a new thing , mostly of communist-regime doing . 
  catholic church managed to put themselves into the possition of an alternative to communist government and influenced few generations this way . 
  this situation is slowly getting back to normal tho , since cc is working tirelessly to alienate as much of the population as possible ( kinda like communists did ) since the regime change . 
  i 'm just pulling your leg . 
  i would n't know anyway , since i do n't think i 've met a single latvian in my life . 
  what 's that awful strawman for ? 
  on the other hand if they were really stupid enough to now know what they are getting into they would be handy in making other dumb people understand that before they make similar decision . 
  nice try my dear eastern european friend !, 
  i would n't hold your breath , since bridge in polish is `` most '' . 
  check the other comment to this one , where it is explained batter . 
  yeah , sorry about that . 
  i 'm on my phone so detailed explanations like this one are a bit too much . 
  here is an example for those still confused tho : when i started to study history on university of warsaw there was one list of candidates from highest to lowest score . 
  top 100 got offered free `` daily studies '' and next 100 paid `` evening studies '' . 
  since there are at 20-something public universities ( and more higher education schools with lower ranks ) that provide significant numbers of free spots for all their majors higher education is basically free , if you 're a reasonably competent individual . 
  id imagine it will be dealt with as diligently and swiftly as possible . 
  doubt anyone wants headlines about german guards abusing other ethnicities at ( refugee ) camps . 
  his point was that scotland had easier time instituting free higher education . 
  communism was what it was but education spendings and equal opportunity scholarships had high priority , so public universities are usually the best ones by a long shot in post-communist countries . 
  and it 's unlikely to change since they are getting paid for educating brightest students for free . 
  polish public universities ( so all the best ones ) are free for those who score high enough on their post-high school exams . 
  hell , you are getting paid for studying few dozens chosen majors as well as when your grades are good enough , when your family is poor , when you are from out of the city etc. 
  visit the nation of perfectionists ... ... who will never stop complaining . 
  2nd one is brilliantly dead on . 
  then i probably should n't nitpick that it was n't really a kingdom ... 
  malaria does n't really exist in europe on its own , so spraying is n't practiced , as far as i know . 
  for how long ? 
  id imagine she 'd get bored pretty quickly .
