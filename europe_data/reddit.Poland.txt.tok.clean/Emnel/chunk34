  edit : oh , right . 
  same-sex marriage issue is also slow on the uptake with only ~ 40 % being pro same-sex civil unions . 
  but when asked about specific rights that constitute said civil union ( visiting partner in hospital , inheritance rights and so on ) approval is over 70 % . 
  if that '93 is your date of birth you should probably rethink your live choices . 
  you can set up laws similar to ones germany has , to make company that closes factory and moves it elsewhere responsible for repaying community for the damage that action and / or cover environmental costs of it . 
  that suddenly makes moving production oversees much less tempting . 
  true . 
  forgot about that . 
  yes . 
  \u0141 is pronounced like english w w is pronaunced like english v easy as that , 
  hmm , i always assumed that it 's pharaoh islands :d, 
  that 's what you get for using this whole `` republic '' part like some made up state !, 
  jokes on you , in polish it 's estonia --  \u0141otwa --  litwa  but you are kinda right . 
  it 's more latin and is related to everyday use of latin language in times of polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  let me check ... ... ... ... all here , no need to worry . 
  perhaps , but on the other hand i 'm yet to find a paper with better commentary-less feature stories . 
  established in 1957 existed throughout the communism as quite independent source of modern journalism . 
  now a bit left from the centre but always reasonable , non-sensationalist and insightful . 
  only paper i 'm still buying every week . 
  ** gazeta wyborcza ** ( www.wyborcza.pl ) [ [ wikipedia ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazeta_wyborcza ) second most popular polish daily ( 1st being one of tabloids , sadly ) . 
  established in 1989 during contract semi-free elections that ended communism in poland . 
  used to be quite neo-liberal but in last decade become more socialist . 
  much more controversial than polityka ( to the point of being hated by more right-leaning people ) but provides a lot of quality journalism nonetheless . 
  go-to medium for important debate , open letter and so on . 
  ** rzeczpospolita ** ( www.rp.pl ) [ [ wikipedia ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rzeczpospolita_%28newspaper%29 ) - less popular than gazeta wyborcza but also much less controversial . 
  generally more conservative than it but stays out of political fight , especially as of late . 
  big economic and law-related section . 
  go-to newspaper for those topics . 
  so it was like `` ok guys , good job on all the stealing . 
  now be so nice and share with the class a bit unless you fancy khodorkovsky treatment . 
  poland/holland . 
  never seem to get them right . 
  so lavrov is n't doing so hot financially and decided to double as finland 's mfa spokesmen ? 
  only difference is that with all that gas russia has some money left . 
  well , weirdest thing about it is that minister is gone but central bank has n't done anything discussed in the recording as of yet ( 7 months after minister changed ) . 
  hard to tell for certain atm , but it sure looks ugly . 
  looks shady as hell too , since conversation , if authentic , had to be recorded over half a year ago ( probably close to a year ) so not releasing it earlier is suspicious . 
  on top of the fact tat recording must have been obtained illegally . 
  fun times ... 
  we have a funny guy over here !, 
  russia and ottoman empire were enemies at the time modern greece was slowly forming therefore russia was supporting greek independence . 
  greeks are yet to review their foreign policy . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 2 . 
  singaporean 3 . 
  south african looks like we are all africans here . 
  hungarian 2 . 
  polish 3 . 
  greek quite spot on . 
  nope , not at all . 
  when penis is erect urine flow is cut off , more or less . 
  and if that was n't a case you 'd probably piss all over your own face or something . 
  thankfully there is 2 page summary , 
  so who 's gon na tell us how misguided this report is ? 
  why ? 
  are they bad at it and it 's a state secret or something ? 
  practice of president being chosen by parliament is n't at all unusual or undemocratic . 
  hell , every pm i can think of is chosen that way and those are the ones holding real power . 
  there is a lot of that going on around eu with battlegroups , joint brigades , constant exercises and so on . 
  kind of making out under the table before finally rising a subject of eu army . 
  well , i sure as hell did n't elect cameron . 
  why would i want to listen to him telling rest of eu what to do ? 
  this whole `` uk is a very special snowflake '' thing is getting old . 
  it 's young lenin is n't it ? 
  yeah , too much if you ask me ... 
  it ca n't be that hard to figure out if all the germans are doing it , right ? 
  that 's more or less what i referred to saying that it pisses me off . 
  i do agree with you . 
  and all that starts with people in poland being paid less than half of the western wage for the very same work . 
  hardworking . 
  i 'm about as lazy as they come and this whole cult of working hard pisses me off . 
  and for germans : have no idea how to steal a car . 
  you must be trolling :d, 
  income from land their own is far greater than what monarchy costs itself . 
  if they were to stop being monarchs that income would go away since this land is their private property . 
  oh well - that 's usually the result of primitive scapegoating campaign , is n't it ? 
  any luck so far ? 
  yes . 
  people in need of political asylum should be granted one , no matter if they are from vietnam , chechnya or us . 
  also action like that from one of the more pro-us eu countries may be the bitchslap they need to get their shit together . 
  no idea . 
  that `` putin 's adviser '' thing is getting old . 
  true but this year 's growth so far is 20 % higher than governments predictions . 
  you guys are weird . 
  last week i exchanged few mails with a czech guy who was using perfectly good english and yet kept apologising me for it being terrible . 
  it must be that shyness . 
  i remember that few years back me and my friends and up parting all night with a group of czechs and slovaks . 
  their english skills magically appeared after 4th bottle . 
  but you guys speak much more polish than one would expect . 
  in summer destinations that is . 
  name of the band may be a bit misleading . 
  this is kiod of music ( videos ) they create : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfbbd1eim1e&amp;feature=kp , 
  i think it can be even other way around . 
  people are very obsessed about proper grammar or simply making mistakes and assume that their english in really , really bad . 
  same with czechs and slovaks as far as i noticed . 
  most of those people knows it few times better than some italians and spaniards i met who had no problem whatsoever speaking 3rd grade english on academic conferences . 
  since * the very , exact way * you do it is the only proper one and others are idiots , right ? 
  and whole national identity thing is just as plain and simple matter as your thought process ? 
   do n't - judge-them-all apologist crap `` oversimplifying complex matters is the tool of populists and morons . 
  do n't be one of them . '', 
  how is random turkish guy on one end of germany responsible for action of some assholes on the other ?
