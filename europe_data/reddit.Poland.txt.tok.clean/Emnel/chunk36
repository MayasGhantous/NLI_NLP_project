  vague = * a bit * misleading , 
  yeah , you are kinda falling apart , are n't you ? 
  and yes - some kind of eu army has to happen sooner rather than later and too much us involvement may slow this process down . 
  same with buying american hardware instead of making our own . 
  they are morons , that 's for sure . 
  marine le pen has no power to decide either way . 
  according to 2011 census there are about 20.000 russians and 80.000 belarusians living in poland . 
  that is 0,05 % and 0,2 % of the population . 
  i 'm afraid you mixed up your history friend  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_minorities_in_poland#demography, 
   i would think biggest reason is llra ( polish minority ) political party and it 's leader toma\u0161evski openly being pro-russian and supporting russia 's anexation of crimea i did n't know that !, 
  i was aware that polish minority in us is cringe-worthy but never thought that lithuanian one will be pro-russian . 
  what a tools . 
  that stance is totally against what polish government and about 90 % of the poles are thinking . 
  very weird . 
  in polish article about this poll it was assumed that this high % is an effect of lithuanian politicians playing anti-polish card to gain internal support . 
  to be honest there is very little to be found about lithuania in polish media , only news like that every few months with commentary along the lines of : `` oh , that again . 
  let 's ignore them some more , they got ta get over it at some point '' . 
  there is very little understanding where this anti-polish sentiment comes from . 
  so it 's 6 out of 6 asked ? 
  title is a bit misleading . 
  sanctions and firm stance are one thing but those warships ? 
  it 's not like they are going to make much of a difference military . 
  whole thing is purely diplomatic thing and our government should n't have pressed france to back from the deal . 
  what french are supposed to do with those warships they do n't need anyway ? 
  stick them up their asses ? 
  all i 'm worried about are right-leaning masses that may blow this thing ( among other ones ) out of proportions and steer us in the direction of us once again . 
  us megalomania can be handy and profitable , but has to be played right and i 'm only half sure that enough of our politicians got over their 80s pro-americanism . 
  i 'm definitely hope we are smarter than that at this point . 
  as in trade union . 
  edit . 
  oh , i guess in this situation it indeed means `` alliance '' . 
  it is n't used like that in modern polish anymore . 
  go to the embassy , pay in advance for a visa , answer question why do i want to go there and if i plan on stealing from uncle sam , only to possibly get the bloody thing and not lose my money for nothing ? 
  yeah , right - ca n't wait to do that !, 
  to be honest i ca n't imagine why would anyone want to emigrate from poland to us . 
  except things like having family there , moving for very specific job or standard things like that like that . 
  do n't care about visas either way , maybe except fact that i would probably consider us as a tourist destination then . 
  on the other hand this whole visa issue helped to cure large % of the population 's severe pro-american sentiment so keeping it as it is for a while would n't be all that bad either . 
  as far as this whole situation goes he was found guilty of breaking the law , but court decided that his actions were commendable ( fixing obvious judicial mistake ) and therefore there were no sanctions or it . 
  few weeks ago he received a prestigious award as `` an exemplary public servant '' . 
  damn , i literally never realized that etymology of wojew\u00f3dztwo . 
  i watched one more of his lectures on similar subject and i have to say that i 'm impressed . 
  i watched quite a lot of lectures like that on various subjects by many more or less wise but usually very respected people and this may be the first time when listening to the us scholar when i did n't have to cringe even a little bit about some misconception , simplification or a mistake regarding history that i 'm familiar with , especially as far as eastern europe or simply europe goes . 
  his logic is ironclad , he knows when to say that he is n't sure or does n't know or that he believes it ca n't be determined and at the same time he is n't afraid of saying things that are supported by evidence and sources . 
  simply a great scientist . 
  guess i might have missed since i do n't follow us media * that * much but i do n't think i 've seem him used as an expert on a matter . 
  is that me being unlucky ? 
  one in prague here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=youkogn7cru ( no worries , it 's in english , past introductions ) . 
  very interesting stuff . 
  biedro\u0144 is apparently considered one of the most competent and hard working mps , and i 've heard good things about grodzka as well . 
  you may not agree with them on one issue or another but calling them `` morons '' actually makes you look like one . 
  edit : apparently we have [ 2 black guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killion_munyama ) . 
  is that actually considered controversial anywhere ? 
  i did a quick google search and we have at least 4 mps on wheelchairs . 
  one with cerebral palsy , one with muscular dystrophy and two after accidents early in their lives . 
  not half bad , but if you want to be all western and liberal these days you have to have a trifecta - a [ black guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_godson ) , [ gay activist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_biedro%c5%84 ) and [ transgender woman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_grodzka ) , 
  can we * please * stop with editorializing titles with things like `` you really have to see this ! '' ? 
  it makes the front page look like a gossip section of a shitty online news site . 
  a little more recent and in-depth [ article via google translate ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&amp;depth=1&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.pl&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,17507625,rosja_nie_chce_wpuscic_borusewicza_na_pogrzeb_niemcowa_.html&amp;usg=alkjrhgg4h2ioztvvykls5qbgztnhisf2a#mt ) . 
  while `` the next 100 years '' is an interesting read and provides some really interesting thoughts it is ultimately flawed by the very fallacy it claims to resist - use of `` common sense '' and assuming that everything will go on pretty much the same way . 
  only difference between friedman 's view and the strawmen he disposes of at the beginning of the book ( like `` in 1910 people were sure of endless age of peace '' , `` in 1940 people assumed that 3rd reich will last forever '' or `` in 1960 people thought that soviet union will last for hundreds of years '' ) is that he simply uses the bigger timeframe . 
  he just takes last 200-300 years and tries to tell the very same story in a bit different circumstances . 
  while his narrative is more or less coherent ( at least to a point ) and may be even considered plausible it seems very superficial and historically incorrect , since it tries to project all the similarities in the previous 300 years while completely ignoring differences and major changes . 
  i 'd say that it is reasonable dystopian view of the future on the same level as some good science-fiction books but more , no less . 
  edit : also his idea of events in europe assumes massive russian resurgence including easy pickings in both belarus and ukraine followed by an attempted expansion to the baltics and poland that will result in practical dissolution of both eu and nato due to refusal of the rest of european countries to provide any assistance against russian threat . 
  that was supposed to lead to the close us-polish alliance that due to technology transfer and military assistance lead to polish rise as a continental power in a tight coalition with other central european countries from estonia to croatia and bulgaria . 
  then he assumes that russia would lose resulting cold war till 2030ish and implode leaving numerous fragmented states from kamchatka to kaliningrad that would be shortly expanded upon by poland and other members of central european coalition in the west , japan from the east and turkey from the south . 
  rest of europe would happily sit on their hands and/or be in a deep crisis for the better part of the century . 
  as you can see while there are some similarities ( namely russian move against ukraine ) they are the predictions of the kind i had myself ( along thousands other people , i 'm sure ) successfully made after georgian conflict . 
  and with better accuracy , since i assumed that ukraine wo n't be a walk in the park for russia . 
  when you look in detail at those assumptions of events that are supposed to kickstart it all they 've been almost all wrong on fundamental level so far . 
  yes . 
  ok , then good job to him on that front . 
  all good , but how is an article by some us journalist almost no one heard about in europe relevant here ? 
  also , can we please keep titles civil ? 
  while i do agree with it , it 's absurdly editorialized . 
   i understand that you got insulted but you should n't allow your emotions to make you tell things that simply are n't true . 
  so it was n't a contest to accuse one another in a silliest and most ignorant way you can think of ? 
  well , that 's interesting . 
  either way i 'd take being a `` disgusting fatty '' over having your childish attitude any day . 
  i 'm a quite big , fit guy and if i were to weight under 82kg at my 180cm i 'd have to have no fat whatsoever . 
  i weight 92 and have a bloody six pack ... 
  i 'd look utterly ridiculous if i 'd manage to somehow lose 10 kg fat without gaining any muscle . 
  i really doubt that it would even be safe for me health-wise . 
  those statistics are worthless . 
  % of obese people on the other hand ? 
  that may actually be useful , since you 'd probably have to be a bodybuilder to not be at least overweight at 30 bmi . 
  for what ? 
  the agreement on refugee crisis was reached by v4 countries during the meeting 2 weeks ago and all of the recommendations included in it become a part of eu agreement from 3 days ago that czech republic , slovakia and hungary promptly rejected in what can only be described as a hysterical fit . 
  there was literally no reason for our government to join them in breaching their own agreement . 
  the level of unprofessionalism exhibited by those 3 governments in last few days is borderline cringeworthy . 
  and ethiopia and eritrea . 
  both christian countries with % of fgm above 70 . 
  at the same time it is completely non-existent in pakistan , bangladesh , iran , india , indonesia , malaysia , jordan , lebanon and so on and so forth . 
  if one were to perform a very professional research , such as [ checking a fucking wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation#/media/file:fgm_prevalence_unicef_2015.svg ) , he or she would know that it is almost exclusively african problem that affects muslims and christians alike . 
  that 's probably because most of us gave up on this sub quite a while ago . 
  i used to post here almost daily , but ca n't really make myself do that anymore for last few months . 
  i do n't see most of the people who used to contribute just half a year ago or so . 
  for what is worth i think that what you see hear is a very vocal , but definitely a small minority . 
  many people are wary of immigrants on top of that , but hardly in a viscous way that presents itself here .
