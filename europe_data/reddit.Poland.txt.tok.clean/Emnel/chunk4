  yeah , one of our worst kings happened to rule [ at the time ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93muscovite_war_%281605%e2%80%9318%29 ) . 
  invasion itself was more of a [ mangnates ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnates_of_poland_and_lithuania ) and skilled [ hetmans ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hetmans_of_the_polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) doing too . 
  we held moskow for 8 years but due to to his fanatical catholicism ( among other things ) not managed to form a personal union like the one we had over lithuania . 
  it 's the royal banner of king sigsmund iii of polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  actual commonwealth flag has no bits in the middle , but folks who did wiki page have used this one for whatever reason , and so it is used as polish-lithuanian flag . 
  being a name of daughter of muhammad seems like a pretty good excuse to me . 
  a bit awkward if he 'd actually become a president later on . 
  great choice for anti-monarchists tho . 
  literally never heard of it . 
  and how would that look in this situation ? 
  spoken like a true pole !, 
  that 's something standard pole would say seeing us in 2nd place . 
  he either messed it up and wrote it the other way around ( `` canada is the most ukrainian country outside ukraine '' makes sense ) or tried to make it deep by giving it a spin . 
  awkward either way . 
  yeah , i know that it has nice storytelling element to it and can be enjoyable that way , but beyond that it is simply terribly made game when it comes to `` game '' part . 
  there is still a lot of casual racism and anti-antisemitism here in poland , is n't it ? 
  frankly , i haven ; t seen that beyond comment sections on the internet , but still - seems like our primary and secondary education is doing an awful job when it comes to making people open towards other cultures . 
  actually dwarf fortress is simply a bad game with most of it 's `` difficulty '' due to atrocious ui , luck-dependence and nonexistent balance . 
  you can learn how to play it in a day , but then you realize that only 10 % of all the things that are in game make sense gameplay wise , and you can do very well ignoring the rest . 
  if you , however , want to do stuff your own way you are in for 20 times more clicking to achieve the same thing . 
  so if you do n't know the proper way to go about things it will seem hard , but once you learn dos and do n'ts ( or rather those few `` dos '' ) you are set . 
  tl ; dr : dwarf fortress is very disappointing , do n't bother . 
  it 's 10 % scale of the game and 90 % people patting themselves on the back that they can play `` the hardest game '' . 
  london seems to be north of cambridge too . 
  maybe he counts poles too ? 
  not all of africa , not centuries and not nearly to that extent . 
  outside of few coastal regions and a little bit down the nile arabs were hardly present in africa before xix century and definitely were n't conquering it european style . 
  even territory of sudan - pretty much a backyard of most powerful and able arab state , was n't subjugated before british came along . 
  even famous inland slave trade was n't really a big thing till the half of xix century . 
  sultanate of zanzibar have been expanding it few decades later , but even that almost exclusively along the coast . 
   i 'm not discounting it , but there were indisputably some sustained and profound benefits to colonization in africa which are still enjoyed to this day . 
  sure , there were some benefits , but i never seen anyone credibly argue that they made up for the damage . 
  or were even close . 
  also placing all africa in one basket makes no sense whatsoever . 
  for example pre-colonial egypt was functioning country with industry , higher education system and so on . 
  hardly similar to pre-colonial zambia . 
   conversely , i really ca n't think of a single benefit that comes with allowing extremist , unskilled , and maladapted third worlders into europe ** by the hundreds of thousands . 
  ** then just look at the numbers of extremists on the map in this thread . 
  claiming that sizable % of muslim immigrants are extremists is just silly . 
  while xix/xx century us/european actions in middle east caused great deal of issues , i would n't say that they hold all the blame for this mess . 
  or even majority . 
  huge part of the problems were created by homegrown arab oppression after disintegration of osman empire . 
  either way , things are much more complicated than you make them to be . 
  while whole concept is obviously stupid , i would n't discard amount of damage caused by european expansion into africa . 
  still - if not europeans , it would have been arabs , few decades later , tops . 
  how is that even related to the topic ? 
  my gf spent a semester studying in germany and new stories about your ... interesting ( ? ), 
  internet content laws and customs were part of almost every conversation throughout that period . 
  shit 's crazy . 
  is it old ? 
  it was working just fine only few days ago . 
  i 'd say that we 've done ok . unemployment was rising ( from high to begin with ) , but slowly - from lowest under 10 % in 2008 to under 12 % now . 
  gdp growth slowed down , but unlike in rest of europe , never stopped and so on . 
  also our liberal government went quite far towards socialism since crisis started while choosing to rise spending in order to invigorate economy , rather than to cut it . 
  people are a bit disappointed by not catching up with our western neighbours as fast as we 'd like to ( especially when it comes to wages ) , but arguably it could have been much worse . 
  our dept is rising tho , so let 's just hope for that crisis to end sooner rather than later , 
  he 's british . 
  interesting , that we achieved biggest increase . 
  good stuff , since that 's one of the most important scores . 
   ca n't possibly imagine any ** probable ** scenario when it turns out `` very bad for europe '' . 
  how so ? 
  ca n't possibly imagine any probable scenario when it turns out `` very bad for europe '' . 
  frankly french/british alliance offer was more of a bluff , than anything else . 
  paris and london wagered that hitler wo n't dare to attack poland with those guarantees and that will give everyone time to build up their armies . 
  that turned out to not be the case , and especially britain was n't in a position to do much . 
  main problem is that they 've [ done almost nothing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war ) - much less than it was possible . 
  most of the blame should have gone towards [ french who were actually in position to even crush german western front ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saar_offensive ) since hitler put only few divisions there in a gambit aimed to quickly overwhelm poland 's army . 
  so , as they say `` it was worse than betrayal , it 's a mistake '' . 
  while french are much more to blame , britain is getting most of it . 
  probably partly due to this [ spit in the face ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_victory_celebrations_of_1946#political_controversy ) , after [ very meaningful polish contribution in battle of britain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptijncdanvw ) . 
  communism has done few things right , but equalizing educational ( and other ) chances through class and gender lines was clearly one of those things . 
  so how that `` less fraud '' puts ep compared to national parliaments within eu ? 
  give or take . 
  press likes to bash eu regulations ( mostly trade and safety ones ) as unnecessary ( or plain stupid ) fruits of self-centered eu bureaucracy . 
  what is your , as an insider , opinion of that bureaucracy ? 
  what 's your opinion of ceta and ttip ? 
  how do you like the idea of more `` federal eu '' ? 
  should it be pursued in near future , in a decade or two , or not at all ? 
  it is surely a political hot potato in many countries ( ehm spain ehm ) , but what should be , in your opinion , eu stance on separatism within eu ? 
  for me as a person who does n't have an agenda either way it seems like with common market , currency and schengen area there was never a better time to allow people to go ahead with their political ambitions . 
  should eu get more involved in conflicts on our borders ? 
  eu expansion into ukraine , moldova , caucasus and turkey ? 
  and that mouth hole fills all the remaining details . 
  i remember watching `` alexander '' with italian dubbing . 
  angelina jolie speaking italian is twice as hot . 
  everyone ? 
  sure ... 
  i would n't say that people are `` vehemently against '' . 
  not for it , but not to the point of uk either . 
  thing is that zloty proved to be very handy in times of crisis . 
  with monetary policy controlled from brussels , we would n't have done so good in last few years or so . 
  that 's about he only reservation i have to implementing euro , so i do n't mind waiting with it till economy stabilizes . 
  but save that i 'm for the change . 
  that 's a good question . 
  once could argue that accessing said books via internet from your sofa still counts like that . 
  at least in poland many libraries offer their digitalised resources online . 
  i 'm originally from be\u0142chat\u00f3w ( [ brown coal/lignite mine ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kopalnia_w%c4%99gla_brunatnego_be%c5%82chat%c3%b3w ) and [ power station producing up to 20 % of all energy in poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/be%c5%82chat%c3%b3w_power_station ) ) , so i was under the same impression as / u/savannajeff to be honest . 
  that is i knew that we produce a lot of black coal , but not that we use it to produce energy to such extent . 
  shale gas sure is a bit of a risky business , but having seen how situation was developing in the east we had to split our gas apples into many baskets . 
  unified eu gas market that could deal with russia as a one partner would be ideal , but there is little traction for that proposal in the rest of the eu .
