  shit kinda adds up . 
  this map is an exaggeration , but keep in mind this : wwii was clearly a traumatic event for countries like france , united kingdom or usa , right ? 
  something that still affects the collective memory to this day etc. 
  in france 1 out of every 72 people died during the war ( excluding colonies ) . 
  in united kingdom 1 out of every 106 people died during the war ( excluding colonies ) . 
  in usa 1 out of every 312 people dies during the war . 
  in poland 1 out of every 5 people died during the war . 
  and then we got left under the boot of uncle joe & co. for half a century , to eventually claw our way out of resulting poverty for following 2 decades . 
  so yes , whole wwii and what followed left quite a mark on the society as a whole that has not entirely disappeared to this day . 
  if you add the fact that according to many historians germany was almost defenceless in the west in september 1939 hoping for british & french inaction thus perhaps even making the war possible to nip in the bud , you can probably understand the disgust we feel towards phoney war and responsible for it , considering all that followed that mistake . 
  ( [ very detailed comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fjgyv/with_headquarters_in_poland_the_united_kingdom/cka0p6t ) on the subject that i have saved for exactly such occasion ! ), 
  that being said , `` godless traitors '' really is n't the 1st thing that comes to mind to most poles when asked about uk , 
  thing is that it 's very consistent with other actions of soviet union at the time . 
  partisans of home army and other officials of polish underground state [ have been arrested and killed by nkwd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_underground_state#1944.e2.80.931945:_decline_and_dissolution ) in previous months in eastern poland if they responded to calls reveal themselves to assist red army . 
  that includes [ a staged trial of polish underground state leaders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trial_of_the_sixteen ) . 
  all the actions of stalin at the time point at the goal of eliminating polish non-communist elites by any means necessary , including warsaw uprising . 
  even modern russian historians do n't argue that lack of help to the uprising was dictated by a desire to get rid of unwanted political elements . 
  and there also is a lack of evidence proving that red army was n't able to advance into warsaw at the time . 
  of for next months . 
  bank of vistula has been reached and held by late august and even 3000 strong infantry force without artillery or bomber support was enough to hold a beachhead for 4 days , while germans needed 2 months to retake huge parts of the city in fight against poorly equipped insurgents . 
  it 's a humorous version , is n't it ? 
  it 's exaggerated and should n't be mistaken for an actual public opinion . 
   w-day commemorates the warsaw uprising of 1944 , the proudest moment in polish history . 
  let 's not get carried away here ... 
   german defences were little , there were just some skirmishes     this is nonsense . 
  part of 1st polish army under general berling made a beachhead on the on the western side of warsaw on 15th of september and held it for 4 days , but was refused any support by red army ( no tanks , artillery or bombers ) and was pushed back with heavy losses . 
  general was shortly after relieved of his duties . 
  you should probably [ read this bit on wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lack_of_outside_support_during_the_warsaw_uprising#soviet_participation:_berling_landings_on_powi.c5.9ble ) , since you seem to have a very limited knowledge of military situation at the time . 
  it 's close enough most of the time .

  poor troll 2/10, 
  not really . 
  the potato thing is hardly a stereotype . 
  what are stereotypes about latvia ? 
  he apparently had other weapon on him and they were afraid that he 's going to attack next person he encounters . 
  they were aiming at the legs and that 's where he was eventually hit suffering a minor injury . 
  poland happens to have the lowest amount of violent crime among all oecd countries , but japan . 
  i never seen anyone attacked.with a knife , nor i know anyone how has been , or seen something like that . 
  some have more of them than others . 
  i know i would . 
   the 75 % income tax rate , for one . 
  that especially was n't ` proven to work ' , and is a terrible idea in general . 
  worked very well for decades in the us . 
  still works in scandinavian countries . 
  and what part of our ideas do you find `` unsound '' ? 
  for the last few weeks such political mavericks and economical quacks like marek belka are pretty much saying the very same things we do . 
  ideas like those are well tested all over europe and proved to work well . 
  we have an excellent group of economists working on the the program in great detail . 
  we 're still over 2 weeks away from presenting it to the voters , but almost all of the financial bits have been counted already . 
  at the moment we 're mostly fine tuning it and double and triple checking the math . 
  view that we are somehow making stuff up as we go and hope for the best is baseless . 
  by neoliberalism i meant measures and goals similar to those listed in washington consensus , the `` trickle down economics '' , the strict free market ideas etc. 
  are they against it ? 
  worldwide neo-liberalism is more and more treated like a fringe . 
  mecca of hardcore conservative economists who when faced with dylema of model not fitting the reality choose to ignore the latter . 
  neo-keynesian approach that is much closer to our views is hardly something that can be considered unorthodox . 
  edit : that being said we 're not claiming that neo-liberal economy does n't have any answers and that is worthless overall . 
  that 's a grand claim beyond our scope . 
  we do , however , believe that it is the last thing polish economy needs specifically at the moment . 
  we track most of the issues plaguing it at the moment to abuse of doctrinal implementation of this manner of economical thought and assert that continuation of this trend will have very negative consequences . 
  and that neo-keynesian shift is something for what is both time and the place . 
   why is it so difficult for poland to have a centrist , social progressive , liberal democratic party with a reasonable view on economics ? 
  and reasonable left-wing party is n't needed ? 
   the problem is that your math basically sux . 
  if someone wanted to tax me with 75 % of income tax , i would definitely leave the country or wash my cash through the cyprus . 
  problem is that law allows for that now . 
  believe it or not , but surprising amount of people shy away from committing crimes . 
  plugging the holes would easily prevent most of the capital flight . 
  also it 's obviously a progressive tax so you would only pay it from the income above yearly 500.000 . 
  it 's actually not an uncommon tax rate eu-wise . 
   the problem in poland is not the income tax - the problem is vat , which should be just one , not couple of vat tariffs , based on product category . 
  let 's make just one vat for everything and raise income tax threshold . 
  rising vat is basically taxing poor people and middle class . 
  plain and simple . 
  they spent disproportionately big amount of their income on low-vat items . 
  most of the society already has terrible and deteriorating purchasing power and putting even more tax burden on lower income people is a great way to suffocate an economy to death . 
  what we need is considerable rise of purchasing power ( by both lowering tax burden and rising wages ) of as many people as possible in order to boost a consumption and kickstart economy while trying to avoid `` middle income trap '' that we 're heading into . 
  in 2014 16.000 people payed pit out of income 1.000.000 pln and higher . 
  while our views may not seem `` reasonable ' to you we at least do the math and check the data . 
  if you add those who used 19 % cit loophole and ones who found a sudden love for cyprus it becomes quite a reasonable source of budget revenue . 
  and high income people are chronically undertaxed compared to the lower parts of the society due to the different profile of consumption they have . 
  i like the program ( most of it ) , quite a few very smart people i know joined it as well and the people i met after joining turned out to be a great bunch . 
  wonder if that had anything to do with the discrimination kurds faced and still face in turkey . 
  also , do you have any source for the extraordinary claim that ` pkk has killed more than isis ever did in terms of casualties ' ? 
  apparently 1st reports were that hunters were spanish . 
  that 's bad . 
  the party i 'm in has been using him as an example of issues in the country and now we 'll have to shut up about it as well as change one of our slogans . 
  and media will obviously glorify him to the point of nausea . 
  frankly i had no idea bulgaria is n't in already . 
  weird . 
  better start sucking up . 
  while angora is a weird bird they sure as hell are n't right-wing [ ( previous week 's issue ) ] ( https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/v/t1.0-9/11214120_10153379557365991_234594457053318689_n.jpg?oh=5e043a22064374b25ee9a240ee03628f&amp;oe=5655383c ) . 
  jkm is a clown , so he probably fitted perfectly . 
  it 's a left-wing satirical magazine ... 
  it 's a left wing satirical magazine ... 
  the amount of people in this thread thinking it 's for real is astonishing . 
  it 's a joke . 
  and the magazine is known for its really bad jokes . 
  they 're actually laughing at people 's stupid concerns . 
  unless they turned right-wing when i was n't watching .
