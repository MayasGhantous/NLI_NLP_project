  if those institutions wanted a safe investments they should have bought japanese or german bonds . 
  but they wanted something that brings more profit , have n't they ? 
  and higher profit means risk . 
  they assessed the risk poorly , but apparently only greeks are here to blame and those banks were bailed out without as much as a slap on the wrist . 
   the eu/imf have replaced greece 's original debt at 15 % that has to be repaid within 5 years , with debt at 3 % that has to be repaid in 20 years . 
  that is an effective reduction of the debt burden by more than 50 % . 
  that hardly matters since it 's still unmanageable . 
   on top of that , the few remaining private lenders accepted a 50 % haircut as well . 
  if you invest is something that is 5-10 times more profitable than your safe bet ( bonds of germany on japan ) then giving up 50 % is hardly something to write songs about . 
   now greece wants/needs another deal , because they fucked around so much , instead of doing the fucking necessary reforms . 
  they have been doing the reforms . 
  they are scraping the bottom of the barrel for years now . 
  and contrary to the popular belief greek top problem was n't social spending ( lower than germany 's as % of gdp ) but inability of a state to collect taxes . 
  while all the cuts sure seem to make many people feel fuzzy inside they are hardly a solution needed to fix greece . 
  especially since there really is n't much left to cut . 
   but what reason does the rest of the world have to be believe , that if greece gets another reduction , they will finally stop wasting money ? 
  nothing . 
  nobody believes greece will reform unless they are forced to . 
  oh yes - greeks are , after all , inherently vile , manipulative and crooked people . 
  kind that has to be thought how to behave by a firm hand . 
  i seem to recall similar tones appearing at large just over 100 years ago . 
  wonder how that turned out . 
  that 's just completely incorrect . 
  absolute bullshit . 
  they protested a bailout on a grounds that it could n't have possibly helped the situation since it was n't a liquidity problem but a crushing dept problem . 
  you do n't have to even be an economist to understand why lending more money to the entity that ca n't function due to their crushing dept ca n't possibly be a solution , unless the interest rate is almost nonexistent . 
  greece needed then what needs now , several excruciating years later . 
  a deal with creditors . 
  the so called `` bailout of greece '' served only one purpose - taking the impossible dept out of the hands of private banks and putting it on shoulders of eu taxpayers . 
  to make thin gs even more grotesque most of people seem to think that greek cuts and reforms can somehow make repayment of the dept possible as long as they will be serious enough . 
  they sure are important for the future of greek state and should not be swept aside , but those who are under the impression that it will make this whole dept ( 17 % annual interest rate long term 10y bonds for crying out loud ! ), 
  manageable are not only economically illiterate , but seem to have problem with elementary school level math . 
  your absolute ignorance in regards to the mechanisms of this crisis is borderline disgusting when coupled with preachy tone . 
  if you ca n't be bothered to educate yourself on a matter , or are simply unable to comprehend it , do us all a solid and keep quiet . 
  even bloody imf admitted that those were actual results of that `` bailout '' . 
  and somehow two fucking years later people still ca n't comprehend the situation and therefore prefer to carry on with things they can understand - like almost tribal scapegoating with greeks as a main dish . 
  it 's also good to remember that varoufakis and his colleagues were out on the streets protesting that bailout considering it the worst possible solution to greek dept problem . 
  and i do agree with him that greece should n't have been bailed out with public money and that a deal with creditors should have been struck then and there . 
  but eu politicians were more concerned by pretending that eu banks ( the creditors from previous sentence ) are all fine and dandy so their bailed out those by laundering money through greek state . 
  the amount of political and economical incompetence and shortsightedness by eu ( mostly german ) politicians that went into creating the shitstorm we are now in would be enough to create at least three separate economical crises . 
  if private creditors were forced to face the consequences of their stupid lending and make a deal cutting the dept by ~ 80 % back then few eu countries would have to nationalize a bank or two that would have been sold with a profit few months later and we would have forgotten about the whole affair years ago . 
  especially if a simple system of ironclad euro-bonds was created to allow countries like greece escape the crippling yearly interest around 15-20 % that keeps sinking their economy while making hedge funds fatter . 
  last time i checked few months back greek bonds had 17 % interest rate . 
  even polish ones have 1 % for fuck 's sake . 
  but nooooo , let 's run around blaming all the greeks for this shit . 
  that will surely lead to better fucking europe . 
  terrorism is by definition advancing one 's goals by making people afraid . 
  well , he 's * technically * right ... and last thing you want in politics is to be technically right . 
  ok , i 'll stop complaining about 27 ^ o right away . 
  obviously . 
  it was n't designed for weaklings !, 
  http://www.forvo.com/word/zbigniew_brzezi%c5%84ski/ ( 2nd one is a bit off ) sz = english sh ( shop ) cz = english ch ( check ) d\u017c = english j ( jam ) d\u017a = dzi = first sound [ < here  ] ( http://www.forvo.com/word/dzie%c5%84_dobry/ ) dz = first sound [ < here  ] ( http://www.forvo.com/word/dzwon/#pl ), 
  they used to sound differently few hundred years ago . 
  same thing about `` h '' and `` ch '' ( english h in `` hold '' ) as well as `` u '' and '' \u00f3 '' ( english oo in `` boot '' ) . 
  if you realize that polish w = english v and polish \u0141 / \u0142 = english w then you have almost all important differences covered . 
  i actually watch a lot of csis stuff ( https://www.youtube.com/user/csisdc/videos ) and while i may not agree with them on some issues and think that kissinger 's place is behind bars i have to say that this may be one of the best think-tanks , if not the best think-tank there is . 
  the range of guest speakers and in-house experts taking part in it is mindblowing . 
  my only problem with them is that they produce so much content that i could n't possibly watch it all . 
  i encourage you to watch a video or two on topics you 're familiar with and you 'd be surprised how close to the point those talks get , especially compared to the average ignorance of us politicians . 
  here is a good example of a very good bit about ukraine/russia : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpopnfztfvq and as far as brzezi\u0144ski goes ? 
  he may be a bit of a hawk , but unlike 99 % of us politicians he understands russia and russia-related issues very well . 
  polish is actually very easy pronunciation-wise , since our spelling is n't lagging ~ 500 years behind , as it is with english or french . 
  you just have to knew a handful of rules like a fact that all `` sz '' , `` cz '' , `` rz '' , `` dz '' , `` d\u017c '' , `` d\u017a '' are actually single sounds without `` z '' . 
  once you know that rz = \u017c = french j ( jacques ) and \u0144 = ni = english ni ( niece ) brzezi\u0144ski is actually quite simple . 
  oh he knows it alright . 
  it 's just a usual lazy way of pushing his own views for the benefit of polish internal debate . 
  views that i do support , which makes me even more annoyed by factual omissions , simplifications and ever-present generalizations . 
  this kind of left-wing journalism does way more harm than good for important issues in poland . 
  and is very common for over 25 years now . 
  if we 're talking about changes that happened in last few weeks those can hardly be viewed as `` changes '' per se . 
  situation was shit before that anyway so it 's most likely a gamble and speculation , as you say . 
  if there will be any finite decision made , this specific situation will almost certainly end . 
  that 's hardly a situation that can be expected to last for a better part of a fiscal year . 
  how ? 
  state income and spending rarely change that rapidly overnight . 
  much of eurozone seems to forget that greece is still an independent state that currently operates on a primary surplus ( they spend less than they earn if you are n't counting the cost of a dept ) so measure such as declaring all the dept null and void are n't out of the realms of possibility . 
  it would hurt greece pretty badly , but an answer to the question if it will be worse than effects of troika 's medicine is hard to determine . 
  and such decision would ripple through the eu economy causing damage well , well beyond the cost of greek dept , that is actually quite minuscule in eu scale . 
  things that are required of greece at the moment are simply beyond its power in both repayment and reform cases . 
  many eu governments are too focused on their internal narrations and the `` morality '' policies to realize that they are just battering greeks without leaving them a light at the end of a tunnel . 
  one that they helped to put them in few years back . 
  aim should n't be to find a `` just solution '' , but a working one . 
  and most of eurozone seems to have a little interest in the latter . 
  the other side broadly assigning blame to the whole ethnic group is about as useful for that debate . 
  nothing good will ever come of the debate if it 's limited to back and forth between deniers and crypto-racists . 
  rome . 
  i 've spent a month there one summer and adored every minute of it . 
  i hope to move there at some point in life . 
  am i missing something or are you actually advocating that starting wwii by germany was justified ? 
  you 're being sarcastic , are n't you ? 
  why would n't we ? 
  discriminating citizens based on their sexual orientation makes no fucking sense whatsoever and should make anyone with any sense of justice and/or half of a brain furious . 
  in 50 years it will be a trivia the same way an information what left-handed people were discriminated against is . 
  good . 
  we really need to give homosexual people ( and couples ) exactly same rights others are enjoying and get it over with . 
  whole process is utterly ridiculous . 
   abuse ? 
  i 've never laid my finger on them . 
  abuse is not just actual violence . 
  but that still seems quite common .
