  in my opinion we ca n't afford neoliberalism any longer . 
  artificially low wages , lack of safety nets and nonexistent job security for people under 40 are ravaging this country in a ways that we 'll continue to feel for decades . 
  economic model.based on cheap labor is unsustainable , and lack of capital among working people is smothering consumption , preventing creation of homegrown companies and plunging reproduction to unheard of levels . 
  without serious effort to significantly improve wages we will suffer very serious stagnation ( best case scenario ) or a demographic , social and political crisis of possibly massive proportions . 
  why are people getting so worked up over him recently , anyway ? 
  he 's not my political type , but he was n't a bad president either . 
  at least nothing like a trainwreck of kaczy\u0144ski . 
  and while i do n't really care about duda that much , i 'd rather not have him in a palace , on an off-chance that pis wins next year 's election . 
  big misconception in my opinion . 
  sld tried exactly that with og\u00f3rek and once her liberal ways were made public , her support tanked from ~ 12 % to ~ 2 % . 
  support for economic left is at about 30-40 % according to polls and studies . 
  not sure how much you are following the politics , but komorowski 's victory is almost certain . 
  and the fact that you have n't heard much of him is one of the main reasons he is going to win . 
  i bet you heard of his predecessor - kaczy\u0144ski . 
  president in poland has about as much power as president in germany , so after kaczy\u0144ski fiasco the top priority for voters is for him not to create problems . 
  komorowski more or less managed to do that in his 1st term . 
  decent enough . 
  i 'm going to vote for him due to a lack of half-decent leftist candidate . 
  well , maybe i 'll convince myself to vote for palikot , but that 's it . 
  well , one is babbling nonsense about jewish-freemason conspiracy , and other represents the connoisseurs of rabid nationalism . 
  what exactly is left for discussion here ? 
   you know , i 've been living in poland for a while now ; the man , your incumbent , is the one with cheerily orwellian ` accord and security ' slogan plastered all over his benevolently big brother-ish posters , right ? 
  slogan is worthy of condom add , and his campaign was pretty bad ( or so i hear ) , but he 's very much harmless . 
  exactly the reason people are voting for him . 
  and since he was polling close to 50 % from the get go most parties did n't even bother trying . 
  braun and kowalski , respectively . 
  have n't noticed anything like that either . 
  if i were to guess they do n't like american influence ( ttip for example ) , but do n't demonize it . 
  as in pro-putin delusions ? 
  not that i 've noticed . 
  the people involved that i know or know of , are as anti-putin as any reasonable person can be , as far as i know . 
  if it would turn out to be a semi-successful grass-root socialist party like syriza and podemos , but with polish view of russia , it could even be very beneficial eu-wise , by injecting this narrative into european socialist discourse . 
  yeah , i 'm not too keen on 75 % tax myself . 
  things like that tend to get unproportional attention and effort put into them , while are of secondary importance at best . 
  it just is n't worth it politically in my opinion , tho i understand where it 's coming from . 
  i assume it 's more about defending against a perception that the whole plan is about lowering taxes and reinforcing social net . 
  it would make it prone to dismissal on a grounds of social populism and wishful thinking , even tho they are looking for increased revenue in all the right places - changing tax law for international companies making business in poland and closing loopholes . 
  thankfully those more retarded ones ( like freemason guy and nationalist guy ) are waaaay below 1 % . 
  someone linked me [ this ] ( http://partiarazem.pl/program/ ) few days ago here on reddit . 
  it seems very interesting and competent . 
  as far as few pages of text go , that is . 
  i happen to know a few people involved in it ( via my fb friends ) and those are quite capable and smart individuals . 
  i 'm even thinking about getting involved . 
  and yes - i also wish sld a quickest possible demise . 
  have you guys heard of this hot , new invention called `` percentages '' ? 
  i hear it will revolutionize the way data is presented and spell the ending of silly narratives !, 
  that 's what it was designed for , but in some cases it ( like polish one ) it also smothers reasonable ( and reasonable-ish ) opposition parties . 
  problem is that she turned out to have more of a neo-liberal views and her candidacy is pretty much a pathetic trick and a slap in the face of left wing voters by left-wing-only-by-name sld . 
  almost all left leaning people i know do n't vote on her on principle and will most likely end up voting for komorowski , due to a lack of serious left wing candidate . 
  only semi-successful left wing party of recent years is slowly but surely falling apart creating new , even smaller ones atm . 
  candidates of those 2 smaller parties ( including one transgender mp ) did n't manage to get 100.000 signatures required to register their candidature in time . 
  so yes - our left is in constant disarray for ~ 15 years now , despite over 30 % of the voters having left wing beliefs ( according to polls and studies ) . 
  a bit more details for people unfamiliar with our political scene : candidates who can win : - [ bronis\u0142aw komorowski ] ( http://i2.pinger.pl/pgr137/d955569200251aa34c5bc251/bronis%c5%82aw_komorowski_rotcropped.jpg ) current president and a member of a ruling centrist-right party po . 
  only question is if he 'll win in 1st or 2nd round . 
  candidates who can get over 5 % votes : - [ andrzej duda ] ( http://andrzejduda.pl/templates/frontend/dev/images/png/aduda.png ) - candidate of main opposition party conservative pis . 
  he has a shot at getting to the 2nd round with komorowski . 
  - [ pawe\u0142 kukiz ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/f6/89/bb/z12290550q,pawel-kukiz.jpg ) - 80s and 90s rockman turned conservative-ish , libertarian-ish candidate running on a platform of implementing fptp voting system in parliamentary elections . 
  he managed to get quite a lot of youth votes and is polling as high as 9-15 % . 
  candidates who can get over 2 % votes : - [ janusz korwin-mikke ] ( http://cdn25.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/t/182698/janusz-korwin-mikke_19807720.jpg ) - hardcore libertarian maverick traditionally getting between 1 and 3 % of the votes , mostly from young voters who later grow out of it . 
  he 's polling around 3 % and popularity of kukiz is n't helping him . 
  - [ ma\u0142gorzata og\u00f3rek ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/34382/pap_magdalena_ogorek600.jpeg ) - an academic teacher without previous political experience ( or interests as it seems ) brought as a candidate by post-communist , `` left-wing '' sld . 
  she was polling close to 10 % but then she started talking and it turned out that she has rather neo-liberal views and little to no understanding of politics and governing . 
  she is polling around 3 % . 
  most of the left wing voters will most likely vote for komorowski instead . 
  - [ adam jarubas ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/20/b4/10/z17514784q,adam-jarubas.jpg ) - candidate of rural psl party , a coalition partner of po . 
  presidential elections are traditionally to no interest for them and he is most likely going to get around 2 % of the votes . 
  used to poll close to 10 % , not he 's somewhere between 1 % and 2 % , despite growing approval of his party anti-conservative massage . 
  the rest : - marian kowalski - represents nationalist fringe . 
  under 1 % - grzegorz braun - represents anti-semites and conspiracy theorists . 
  under 1 % - pawe\u0142 tanajno - not really sure what he 's about . 
  liberal left , i assume . 
  under 1 % - jacek wilk - another libertarian candidate , apparently . 
  under 1 %, 
  the what now ? 
  never heard a thing about that . 
  so it 's almost the same as ours . 
  every * wojew\u00f3dztwo * ( sort of as your * land * ) has different lists of representatives to vote for . 
  those lists that get past the treshold ( controversial 5 % as well ) get a number of sits that are assigned to people on the list based on amount of votes their got . 
  i 'd say that dropping the treshold to 2,5-3 % would make it a very solid system . 
  while most of us ca n't help themselves , but enjoy ukip 's demise , the fact that 12,6 % of votes turns into 0,15 % of representation is a democratic failure of massive proportions . 
  what brits think of their voting system ? 
  what others ? 
  hardly a big issue with 649 other mps to stop her from apparently ruining the country . 
  she may yet prove very competent , despite young age . 
  what he said is confirmed in the 2nd bloody sentence of the damn article you linked . 
  you are absolutely the worst kind of stupid . 
  one who is sure of the opposite . 
   i read the programme , and while most points of it are the exact opposite of what i support ( and i almost asked myself if this is for serious a few times ) not on all counts , i hope . 
   it would be nice to have such party as a constructive opposition instead of the current left . 
  good luck . 
  compared to the bloody sld they sure seem like a second coming of ~ ~ marx ~ ~ kuro\u0144 . 
  75 % is for those earning over 500.000 pln/year with 15 % for the poorest and with tax-free amount equal to 12 times `` social minimum '' - an amount of money required per person to function for a month . 
  at this point it 's ~ 850-1050 pln/family member depending on the size of said family . 
  hmm , that 's not bad . 
  not bad at all . 
  only few ideas i did n't like were limited office terms and referendums and some bits about public employment , but that 's more of a caution than disagreement . 
  thanks a lot - i 'll keep a close look . 
  hell , if they prove competent and realistic enough i may even get involved in something like that for the 1st time in my life . 
  more like 20-30 % , but yeah . 
  it 's ridiculous .
