  some of those things were created via aggressive selective cross-breeding over the last 150 years ( like various grain plants and farm animals ) and some via mutagenesis in the last century ( almost all of of the fruit and vegetables ) . 
  and mutagenesis basically means throwing a shit ton of radiation at seeds and seeing what happens . 
  modern gmo are light years ahead of most of our food in terms of security . 
  i have nothing against gmo , but * a lot * us business practices regarding that . 
  we should avoid those like a plague . 
   `` believing not practising catholic '' hell , we even have `` practicing not believing catholics '' !, 
  well , you can replace `` austrians '' with `` habsburgs '' , if that makes it less problematic , but as far as i can see , what he wrote is correct . 
  and i really doubt it was supposed to be an austrian bashing over something that happened 400 years ago . 
  especially since our moron of a king at the time sent help against czechs in the form of infamous [ lisowczycy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisowczycy ) . 
  whatever austrians did to czechs at the time pales in comparison to the exploits of those gentlemen . 
   unlike morocco who was n't even a thing when the muslims invaded them . 
  not sure i understand that part . 
  what do you mean ? 
  also , just in case someone thinks i 'm being serious - i 'm not suggesting that anyone has a claim on anything or should cede something to someone . 
  italians wo n't get a dime because their helicopters are unproven to the point that they are n't certified to fly over water yet . 
  and navy version is a pert of the deal . 
  also it 's very sensible that we bought french helicopters over american ones , since the latter are small and we have a decent number of that kind ( [ sok\u00f3\u0142 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pzl_w-3_sok%c3%b3%c5%82 ) ) while needing the large ones . 
  and french are bigger on top of being a very solid construction . 
   if we recognized territorial claims from 1415 , then i guess sizeable portions of france should be given to the english monarch . 
  just imagine how fun it would be !, 
  also you should give it back to portugal first , since they held it between 1415 and 1668 . 
  before 1415 ? 
  another ~ ~ holocaust ~ ~ armenian genocide denier ? 
  level of turkish historical education is fucking scary . 
  yeah , sure . 
  they have n't been left-wing for almost 2 decades now and look how they flourish !, 
  a semi-competent left wing party would easily get 20 + % of the votes . 
  the guy linked a the telegraph article and cited gaddafi . 
  that happens to be one of the better posts in this thread . 
  after a closer inspection he indeed turns out to be an utter retard , but the post is solid . 
   slovakia here we go again ... 
  we appreciate your corrections , but there is no need to be a dick about it . 
  i think you are n't up to date on the treatment applied to greece . 
  it is more along the lines of taking away someone 's home and income and then expect them to get better on their own . 
  huh ? 
  proper tactical simulation game is something that is still missing in today 's market . 
  i think that it 's only you and that other one who equate critique of rumblings of one american to an attack on all of them . 
  that being said , posts like that should n't be allowed - they are indeed worthless `` circlejerks '', 
  you mistake a stereotype and an educated guess . 
  we are talking about an english speaker with a fixation on skin color , that has no clue about european history and uses predominantly american site . 
  there is a slight chance that she is and australian or perhaps an extremely undereducated european/south american who happens to speak a good english . 
  it is , however , much , * much * less likely . 
  that 's the definition of an educated guess . 
  edit : oh , and look at [ that ] ( http://jenniferrpovey.tumblr.com/jrpovey ) !, 
  who would have guessed . 
  the use of term `` race ' towards humans always seemed weird to me . 
  in polish only people using a polish version of it ( `` rasa '' ) in such a way are the vilest of racists who never got over 1930s . 
  i assume germans do it similarly . 
  rest of the society uses it only in regards to animal breeds and so on . 
  for the determination you use `` race ' for we use a skin color . 
  and i do think we 're much more accurate in it than [ english-speaking world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_%28biology%29 ) . 
  she has a pretty us-unique fixation on skin color . 
  it 's very likely she 's american . 
   ( ... ) it is * a blog platform * that * among many other things * has ( ... ) i 'm well aware that reddit is way worse in some subs , but the question i was answering to was not about reddit , nor i claimed otherwise . 
  i 'm really not sure what you are arguing against . 
  oh yes . 
  turkish stance and others like it disgusts and enrages me to no end . 
  i really do believe that the way chosen by germans and after '89 the rest of central europe is the only one that promises lasting peace . 
  xx century showed how how easily ressentiments and misguided national pride can be used by totalitarian states to in the making to do most barbaric things . 
  making people to come to terms with their past is the only way democratic states of today can prevent the resurgence of totalitarianism . 
  and that is n't just a theory - it has been tested over last 25 years . 
  few people realize that central europe in '89 had all the makings of another , but much , much bigger balkan war . 
  polish-german border was n't ratified , belarus was making claims for about half of the lithuania , poland could have demanded vast chunks of ukraine , belarus and lithuania , hungary could have pretty much picked on any neighbor and so on . 
  there were no treaties in place and in a bit different politicians were in power in few of those capitals , we might have had a situation here in which balkans or even eastern ukraine of today would seem like a happy place . 
  [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-reconstruction-nations-ukraine-lithuania/dp/030010586x ) by timothy snyder does a really good job of presenting those first few years after the cold war , if anyone 's interested . 
  seriously ? 
  please tell me that by `` lithuanians '' you mean a singular tabloid newspaper or something like that . 
  are you trying to give an example of what i speak ? 
  those are mostly american kids , so they project issues in the us ( where white people are arguably still in a much better position ) onto the rest of the world without understanding either . 
  here is [ an example that stuck with me ] ( http://feministing.com/2013/10/03/wow-that-lorde-song-royals-is-racist/ ) . 
  i stumbled upon it by accident and that is still the only text that made me call `` how can you be so stupid ?! '', 
  at the screen ever few sentences . 
  as far as i understand it is a blog platform that among many other things has an over-representation of undereducated youngsters fighting for social justice around the world one angry and thoughtless post at the time . 
  good ol' self-righteousness , stupidity and ignorance . 
  i do n't think there is a more enraging mix . 
  if i understand correctly he tried to join ( an unspecified branch of ) an army earlier in 1942 but was n't drafted till 1944 when he was assigned to waffen ss division . 
  and frankly , i 'll take '44 ss member over * any * '39 wehrmacht one any day , as far as not being a genocide perpetrator goes . 
  great author and an important voice . 
  i wish people were n't as eager to condemn him for being drafted into ss as they are to absolve anyone who joined wehrmacht . 
  neither of those things treated as absolutes make sense in light of historical facts . 
  not sure if it is more disgusting or pathetic . 
  well , there is a reason that after kaczy\u0144ski was a prime minister he and his party lost 9 elections in a row since ( about to lose 10th ) . 
  it was nothing of note . 
  an issue for a week or so i never heard of since , for over a decade . 
  i still do n't see how it equates to decades of denial , lies and prosecution by turkish government . 
  but then again , even putin pales in comparison . 
  100 hand grenades does n't seem like a lot ? 
   poland just tries to justify it rather than pretend it did not happen . 
  we do ? 
  nothing in the article you linked says that . 
  we admitted that it happened and apologized for the pain and suffering it brought on innocent germans . 
  not to mention that the whole affair is wildly unpopular and was forced on poland . 
  those cleansed territories were resettled by poles expulsed from our eastern territories that got annexed by soviet union . 
  maybe it 's just late , but your comment does n't seem to make any sense . 
  so why are n't you acknowledging [ assyrian genocide ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_genocide ) ? 
  it 's not like they even have a state that can demand reparations . 
  like armenians or [ greeks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) for example . 
  also justifying not acknowledging millions of murdered civilians on a basis of `` they may demand some money ! '', 
  has to be one of the most disgusting political ideologies still existing in the world . 
  and that 's supposed to be the stance of most turks ?
