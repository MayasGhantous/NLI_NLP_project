   though they made some poor decisions . 
  true . 
  so the only tragedy here is that the above-mentioned plan was poorly executed . 
  have i failed to read something ? 
  it 's raining delusional morons today , is n't it ? 
  for call it an emanation of scientific method you 'd have to actually critically think and confront your own ideas . 
  what you perform can hardly be even called a caricature of it , since it is n't even funny . 
  i sure hope you are just an uneducated teenager . 
  in that case you will probably get over yourself in a few years . 
  the rest of the reasons you listed . 
  they were never expressed as reasons . 
  because even in the levels of 3rd reich propaganda they made no fucking sense . 
  hence :  the rest seems to be pulled right out of your arse . 
  are you even able to read english ? 
   wwii was reaction to the unfair outcome of wwi . 
  so basically germans are blameless here . 
  how quint . 
  there is more and more of ignorant fucks like yourself these days . 
  i sure hope that 's not some kind of new trend in germany . 
  i 'm not saying that the other guy was correct . 
  i 'm saying that you are simplifying at least as much . 
  and i 'm not sure what the fuck war in ukraine has to do with polish-czechoslovakian border conflicts and the question of german aims before wwii . 
  your posts have all of the characteristics of mental diarrhea caused my severe ignorance . 
  by declaring war on poland ? 
  `` restore the historical justice '' , perhaps among other things , but the rest seems to be pulled right out of your arse . 
   i am not arguing who was right and who was wrong . 
  i am just saying that the `` facts '' , as we are used to see them presented , are actually false . 
  no , you are just pointlessly nitpicking , taking advantage of a fact that a reddit post on such a subject ca n't possibly contain all the facts . 
  so what was their goal again ? 
  please remind me . 
  catchy one . 
  for me it would be a poem-turned-song [ `` do cz\u0142owieka prostego '' / `` to the simple man '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wchlvzbxjy ) it was originally written in 1929 by a famous interwar poet [ julian tuwim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julian_tuwim ) and turned into a song by a punk rock/ska band [ akurat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akurat ) . 
  as for lyrics , they are really hard to translate in all their glory ( and i mean glory - this is one of the masterpieces of polish poetry ) but here are the too decent-ish attempts : translation 1 ( more loose ) :  when plastered billboards scream with slogans  ` fight for your country , go to battle '  when media 's print assaults your senses ,  ` support our leaders ' shrieks and rattles ...  and fools who do n't know any better  believe the old , eternal lie  that we must march and shoot and kill  murder , and burn , and bomb , and grill ...  . 
   when press begins the battle-cry  that nation needs to unify  and for your country you must die ...  dear brainwashed friend , my neighbor dear  brother from this , or other nation  know that the cries of anger , fear ,  are nothing but manipulation  by fat-cats , kings who covet riches ,  and feed off your sweat and blood - the leeches !, 
   when call to arms engulfs the land  it means that somewhere oil was found ,  shooting ` blackgold ' from underground !, 
   it means they found a sneaky way  to make more money , grab more gold  but this is not what you are told !, 
   do n't spill your blood for bucks or oil  break , burn your rifle , shout : ` no deal ! ', 
   let the rich scoundrels , kings , and bankers  send their own children to get killed !, 
   may your loud voice be amplified  by roar of other common men  the battle-weary of all nations :  we wo n't be conned to war again !, 
  translation 2 ( more accurate one ) :  when every wall is hid by many  new posters freshly pasted up ,  when ` to the people ' , ` to the army ' ,  in black print stare appeals alarming ,  and any dolt , and any pup  will take for gospel each old lie  that one should go and shoot off guns  and murder , poison , rob , at once ;  start drumming into all our noggins  the ` fatherland ' ; the mob incite ,  bamboozle with bright-coloured slogans ,  egg on with ` our historic right ' ,  ` every inch ' , ` glory ' , ` sacred borders ' ,  with ` our forebears ' , ` pay the price ' ,  with ` heroes ' , ` flag ' and ` sacrifice ' ;  when bishop , pastor , rabbi come  to say a blessing on each gun ,  for god has told them , that his will  is that for country -- you should kill ;  when gutter tabloid screams and rages  in letters huge on its front pages ,  and herds of females lose their voice  throwing bouquets at ` our brave boys ' ,  -- o , my untutored simple friend ,  mate from this land , or other land !, 
   know that the bells for these alarums  kings strike , with girls with ample charms ,  know it 's all hogwash , lies perverted ,  and when these call out : ` shoulder arms ! '  that somewhere from the ground oil spurted ,  with dollars soiling the bright colours ;  that in their banks there 's something rotten ,  they smelled some moneybags , it looks ,  or cooked some scheme , the oily crooks ,  for higher import tax for cotton . 
   drum on the pavement with your gun !, 
   ours the blood , the oil is theirs !, 
   and through each capital and town  scream out , to guard your cash blood-won :  ` tell us another , noble sirs ! ' . 
  it 's really hard to keep up with all the dangers britain is in . 
  oh , do n't worry about it . 
  i do n't believe in deleting comments , but i 'm totally fine with whatever you prefer . 
  is it ? 
  / r/askhistorians fest is simply amazing !, 
  yeah , [ i 'm all about criticizing him with today 's standards ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/311it1/today_is_otto_von_bismarcks_200th_birthday_he_was/cpxy42v ) . 
  either way i * really * do n't think that the salary was a major motivator here . 
  can we please not devolve into ad hitlerum and ad leopoldum here ? 
  those threads on / e/europe become worse and worse by the day . 
  was bismark a ultra-nationalistic cunt ? 
  yes . 
  but he was also a product of his time and a man of great accomplishments . 
  the repression against poles was obviously vile and pathetic , but reasonably benign compared to contemporary russian exploints , not to even mention the sheer barbarism of hitlerism or belgian congo . 
  90 % of the poles in this thread need to get a fucking grip . 
  hopefully before an imprint of my palm will becomes an integral part of my face . 
  xix century called , they want your backwards ass back . 
  maybe i 'm not in the mood today , but i find such exchanges of one-liners a waste of space . 
  while we do have quite a few over-zealous whiners here and there , i 'm afraid we have a long road ahead of us , before we match the level of whine brits produce about eu . 
  that 's our ultimate goal for the next ~ 100 years . 
  on that note i 'd like to thank you all for being such a shining example in that department . 
  football world championship may be out of reach , but this one is firmly in your hands , 
  you are that particular kind of stupid , are n't you ? 
  one that considers himself incredibly smart and is prone to such ideas as this - * almost * correct , but ultimately , simply stupid ones . 
  and discarded hundreds upon hundreds of times before , since halfwits like that are more common than a cold . 
  but let me spell it out to you once again : there was a world war . 
  it was ultimately started by a singular action of a singular country . 
  and no . 
  it would n't have been any less damning if it somehow has n't devolved into the world war . 
  unless your next order of business is to condone actions of both wehrmacht and einsatzgruppen that started in early september 1939 . 
  here is the summary of the whole affair , for those interested : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_border_conflicts, 
  i 'm not an expert on that period , but my understanding is that the peace of '21 was signed in such a manner , not due of political and militaristic necessities , but because of ideological agenda of national democrats who wished to polonize ukrainians and belorussians rather than treat them as equals and allies . 
  to that end they were against the creation of ukrainian state and opted for inclusion of only a part of ukrainian population into what was supposed to be mainly nationally polish poland . 
  that was both unlikely to work ( 3 millions jewish polish citizens that hitler wanted dead ? ), 
  and if it did , i could have meant nazi domination over europe for decades to come . 
  however horrible wwii was i 'm not sure if such an alternative would have been any better . 
  and reasonable people have n't been blaming today 's germans for wwii for some time now . 
  are n't bringing it up either . 
  as long as uneducated are n't trying to rewrite history and reassign the blame and a stupid and ignorant way such as this . 
  i know it 's april 's fool and all that , but the correct way to go about historical debates online is to : 1 . 
  educate yourself about history . 
  discuss it . 
  i always found blaming germans for whole of wwi very unfair . 
  out of 3 countries that actually started the whole thing ( russia , austria-hungary and germany ) germans are clearly the least guilty . 
  as far as wwii goes ? 
  naaaah , do i think the blame is where it belongs . 
  for what it 's worth you are both morons . 
  yeah , that sounds about right . 
  i do n't know much about russian colonialism , but french one was indeed more of an expansion than exploitation . 
  it has written interesting stories , like the two actors of haitian revolution : [ jean-jacques dessalines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-jacques_dessalines ) and especially [ toussaint louverture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toussaint_louverture ) . 
  it will be a while before a british colonial subject gets this kind of recognition . 
  zionism in its more religious forms is quite fucked up . 
  there is few % of israelis who believe that all non-jews in their holy land should be killed . 
  they preach that publicly and have representatives in knesset . 
  it actually puzzles me how much shit are anti-israeli activists making up , when easily accessible facts about both israeli extremism , apartheit-like policies and numerous killings of civilians by military are well documented and pretty fucking damning . 
  but i guess that 's where this antisemitism you speak of comes in . 
  on the other hand i do understand them to some extent .
