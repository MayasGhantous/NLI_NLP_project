  especially palestinians . 
  for me it 's kinda personal since i 'm partly jewish myself and what israel devolved into makes me fucking sick to my stomach . 
  so criticizing israel and its jingoist policies makes one an antisemite now ? 
  yeah , that sounds like significantly inflated numbers . 
  not sure how either supporting or not supporting israeli policies has a bearing on a truthfulness of that . 
  while i do n't know about the site or their agenda , `` zionism '' is a real thing - a political movement . 
  not sure what those quotation marks are there for . 
  said a guy about the top post . 
  yeah , those are the 3 i had in mind . 
  it was n't all * that * bad . 
  such video is obviously a massive simplification and militaristic bits are , naturally , easier to display . 
   that 's cute , but nowhere near of polan level ( over 100 ) * really ? 
  * i can think of maybe 3 . 
  and i always thought i have a decent vocabulary . 
  while belgians deserve the blame , it 's important to remember that the rest were n't all that far behind . 
  british extermination of tasmanians ? 
  man-made indian famines ? 
  german shark island ? 
  french algeria ? 
  has anyone * ever * seen those terms used before ? 
  get back to us with your anti-mod whining when something of value is lost . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  wow . 
  i did n't think you could have been any dumber , but here we go !, 
  that 's actually quite impressive !, 
  do n't get me wrong , it was reasonable to the point and the the certain extent . 
  and now we are way beyond both the point and the extent . 
  almost none . 
  especially hispanics . 
  i hear there are some in spain , but the government and the eu are working hard to make them leave . 
  and thank god - they almost ruined spain . 
  most of the eastern europe got really , * really * , * really * high on neoliberalism in early 90s . 
  along the lines of `` communism was an utter shit , so let 's do * everything * exactly opposite way ! '', 
  depends on what part of `` the masses '' and what part of the ruling class you ask . 
  but yes - probably about 50-60 % of the population leans towards neoliberalism , albeit expectations of pay rising towards the western european standards is also very high , well beyond 30-35 % socialist-leaning population . 
  i do n't see a 1:1 correlation between a work-culture and a quality of welfare that the comment was implying . 
  if anything it is linked to the dominant economical and political beliefs of a ruling class and/or society as a whole . 
  for example in poland a `` people will take advantage of it ! '', 
  argument hardly ever transpires and main one against both welfare and higher pay is that it would smother economical growth and increase unemployment due to higher costs of labor . 
  and we have 4th lowest labor costs in the entire eu while having about as well educated and english proficient workforce as countries with labor costs 5 times higher . 
  yeah , thankfully that kind of statements will mark you a moron and unfit for working with children in eyes of the most of the society . 
  sadly , not in all of them . 
  what the actual fuck ... 
  i looked at the title , looked at the . uk address and was relieved it was n't in poland . 
  right ... 
  i really hope there will be prosecution for this kind of shit . 
  or they do n't have a generous welfare system since they follow a neoliberal dogma . 
  not a study itself , but [ a press release ] ( http://www.britsoc.co.uk/media/84290/generous%20welfare%20benefits%20make%20people%20more%20likely%20to%20want%20to%20work,%20not%20less,%20research%20suggests.pdf?1427799136444 ) by an [ institution ] ( http://www.britsoc.co.uk/media-centre/press-releases.aspx ) that published the study . 
  maybe the study itself is somewhere there as well , but i got ta go right now . 
  also it 's hard to be entrepreneurial and actually start a new business ( or become a productive member of a society in a different way , like arts ) when your salary barely covers your basic needs . 
  and especially if losing that income would significantly endanger you . 
  not to mention how it affects decisions such as one about having children . 
  while generous welfare system and semi-comfortable minimal wage are n't an ideal solution and can be to some extent abused , i do believe that benefits for both society and real economy greatly outweigh the costs and potential issues . 
  yeah , that 's probably correct . 
  i think i 'm just refusing to consider them a * real * media . 
  even with all the us culture we are all consuming it feels very foreign to me . 
  i 'd call it `` socially individualistic and mentally collectivist '' . 
  an exact opposite of what i consider optimal . 
  with some crazy labor laws and culture in regards to jobs . 
  also whole crime and law situation seems to border on police state and kafka . 
  and cities are just noisy and ugly . 
  that 's what i 'm talking about !, 
  bloody brits do n't even remember to mention us once these days , yet alone treat as such an important threat to society . 
  always chasing that hot new thing to blame , tossing old ones aside without as much as a minor tabloid harassment . 
  i 'm ... a bit confused ... 
  so we 've just been a one season wonder , huh ? 
  that 's just hurtful ... 
  i was reading it and thinking - `` damn , that 's kinda bad . 
  i wonder what country that is . '', 
  i really do n't think that 's accurate outside of maybe 10 % of the people . 
  not even media come up with this shit as far as i 've seen . 
  to expand on that : communists/solidarity neo-liberals/socialists entrepreneurs/intellectuals conservatives/liberals 20-yearolds/50-yearolds catholics/unbelievers moderate catholics/catotaliban employees/employers universities/market left/right populists/elitists liberal media / ~ ~ ultraconservative ~ ~ independent media kaczynski/tusk and so on and so forth . 
  just pick and choose yours . 
  i think that one got turned around tho , right ? 
   poles are given special blame that 's very considerate !, 
  well earned !, 
  four others got sentences between 2 and 3 years as well . 
  no suspention either . 
  those got boring 3 threads ago . 
  wow . 
  look at that egypt . 
  looking at those list i wanted to go with austria , but then again , not sure how i feel about semi-militaristic organization from there . 
  let 's go with luxemburg !, 
  yes , right . 
  as i said , it 's far from ideal , but it is quite old . 
  and i guess it depends how you look at it - in for example it 's hard to attribute all the answers to racism when results between lithuanians and black people vary only slightly . 
  i realize that racists are n't exactly among sharpest tools in a shed , but being racists towards * lithuanians * as a pole would be borderline insane . 
  here is another one http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2014/k_149_14.pdf from last year . 
  question is a bit different and refers to a number of minority types . 
  here is the main graph translated and mutilated by my paint skills : http://imgur.com/uoy7ieu  most people in eastern europe are likely to be outright racist because the region there is so ethnically homogeneous sure . 
  how about you start working on your racism instead of making up excuses and trying to pull us into your fucking gutter ? 
  you clearly are a keen observer and an adept analyst of geopolitics and we 'd love to hear more of your learned opinions on the subject of nato-russia relations . 
  just keep in mind that project of missile shield in poland has been scraped like 5 years ago . 
  you got ta use a brown one . 
   first of all , the `` study '' , has such a small sample size , it hardly reflects accurate data . 
  i thought that the fact that those are % s will be obvious to anyone ... 
  it 's a proper study on a 1123 sample performed by oldest polish public polling institute and the best polish university . 
   it 's completely obvious that you 're more likely to encounter racism in an eastern european country than a western european city . 
  that 's probably true .
