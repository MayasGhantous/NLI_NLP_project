  not necessarily because of significant difference between the number of racist , however , but i 'd imagine because western racists are suppressed by political correctness while ours are n't since they are mostly throwing their insults into the void due to minuscule black population . 
  i just found [ a study from 1998 ] ( http://www.bezuprzedzen.org/doc/12polacy_wobec_ludzi_innych_narodow_1998_obop.pdf ) ( 17 years ago ) on the subject . 
  some questions : * would you allow your children to play with children with other skin color ? 
  92 % rather yes , 6 % rather no * would you invite a person with different skin color to your home ? 
  89 % rather yes , 8 % rather no * would you agree for a person with different skin color to be your doctor ? 
  87 % rather yes , 9 % rather no * can a child of a polish woman and an englishman be called a pole ? 
  80 % rather yes , 16 % rather no * can a child of a polish woman and a lithuanian be called a pole ? 
  79 % rather yes , 17 % rather no * can a child of a polish woman and a black man be called a pole ? 
  72 % rather yes , 24 % rather not * your friend wants to marry a lithuanian - would you advice for or against it ? 
  25 % against , 68 % for * your friend wants to marry a black person - would you advice for or against it ? 
  36 % against , 57 % for * your friend wants to marry a chinese - would you advice for or against it ? 
  36 % against , 55 % for * your friend wants to marry a russian - would you advice for or against it ? 
  30 % against , 62 % for while the results are not ideal ( albeit outdated and from the times when half of the population have n't seen a black man in a flesh ) they hardly support your ridiculous idea that slavs are significantly more racist . 
  tho the part about being more likely to be a subject of racist discrimination may be correct . 
  not necessarily because of significant difference between the number of racist , however , but i 'd imagine because western racists are suppressed by political correctness and will stick to stormfront and / r/europeans , while ours are n't since they are mostly throwing their insults into the void due to minuscule black population . 
  but then again , you are clearly better informed about a society here . 
  edit : it 's in % ... 
  i thought that was kinda obvious . 
  it 's a study performed by oldest opinion polling institute and the best university in poland on a sample of 1123 people .

  i have literally never heard anyone make a statement that dating with a black guy is wrong nor have heard anyone speaking about such opinions . 
  but then again , you are clearly better informed about a society here .

   if anything , slavs are racist as fuck compared to western europeans , especially with blacks . 
  and that statistic is based on what , exactly ? 
  not counting your xenophobia , that is . 
  well , to be honest anyone digs new and uncommon things . 
  for example no one has a better sex life in polish dorms than ~ ~ far-eastern ~ ~ asian female exchange students . 
  why ? 
  have you ever seen an army poster , along the lines of `` join the army !, 
  but keep in mind , that you may and up dead on some god forsaken desert '' ? 
  army posters are n't known for their accuracy , are they ? 
  my * joke * really was n't supposed to be on a level of anthropology phd thesis . 
  frankly i had no idea it was going to be such a hit . 
  that 's a lot of people , even considering that bia\u0142ystok has 300k inhabitants and is in the far east of the country . 
  i do n't think i 'd bother to leave home in order to see a handful of apcs . 
  `` join the army !, 
  way better than ferguson . '', 
  totally true . 
  do n't be a dirty , little liar !, 
  always . 
  it was clearly legit . 
  polish-woman-in-her-60s hair color in the bottom right is unmistakable . 
  while i get the fascination with the us among people who were teens/young , opposition-minded adults in early 80s , i 'm always a bit confused and surprised when it 's is shared by some younger people . 
  then i guess that 's a really nice photo and it 's not like black people with movie-star looks are in abundance around here . 
  more than `` that 's gon na be a fun facebook photo '' ? 
  no , not anymore - they are independent since 2008 . 
  hmm , both those words might have been taken from polish or other slavic language tho . 
  well , in poland radical left is firmly anti-russia/ussr , while radical right is pro-putin . 
  our school system installs crippling perfectionism in students . 
  ca n't speak as good as a native speaker ? 
  better not speak at all !, 
  first time when i had to actually communicate in english i was was doing about as well as the.people you describe . 
  few hours and beers later i was suddenly able to have a very decent conversation on almost any subject . 
  if by `` everyone '' you mean `` maybe one moron somewhere '' then sure . 
  i 'm pretty sure that no one with quarter a brain is looking forward and hoping for a war . 
  that 's very reassuring ... thx man !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ asshole, 
  perhaps , but clearly not as sexy as [ this one ] ( http://www.equipped.pl/wp-content/uploads/762pr-msbs556-family.jpg ) . 
  well , we are apparently supposed to replace beryl with [ msbs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/msbs_radon ) soon-ish ^ ^ ^ tm so we could totally send some old beryls to our german friends , 
  ugh ... ipn should really focus on what they were created to do , instead of playing politics once again . 
  and learn how to spell-check , apparently . 
  was n't it like 10 years ago ? 
  and if i remember correctly it were n't all the newspapers , but the usual suspects - tabloids and conservative leaning ones supporting kaczy\u0144ski 's government . 
  most reasonable people found it ridiculous and kaczy\u0144skis ' foreign policy as a whole was the main reason of their incoming loss in the election . 
  as well as the fact that their party has n't won a single election since . 
  for 8 years now . 
  i 'd say that overwhelming part of a public has opinion of germany resembling the one you responded to . 
  that being said whole schroder thing and his cosiness with russia was n't helping . 
  i just want to point out that buying all those german tanks is not to that end . 
  not at all . 
  even in a slightest . 
  we are very peaceful people . 
  not at all known for holding a grudge . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ next ^ ^ ^ ^ shipment ^ ^ ^ ^ due ? 
  thx . 
  you must be the edgiest gimbus in town !, 
  damn , you 're right . 
  i even linked a fucking daily mail . 
  i really should n't read things before 1st coffee . 
  i do n't know if it was profitable or not , i 'd imagine that people from lw\u00f3w and wilno would disagree . 
  and i 'm inclined to agree with them even tho i like the political views of those who are now in the west over those who stayed in the east . 
  and i 'm not really sure if becoming so unnaturally homogeneous society is such a good thing . 
  we are really close to the title of most homogeneous society in recorded history while historically poland was a multicultural state with people of many cultures and nations considering it their fatherland . 
  but that 's beside the point .
