  piast poland was a fact ( tho it never really covered all the area you have in mind at the same time ) but extrapolating that early medieval fact into xx century to make some kind of claim is beyond insane . 
  i would have to write a few dozen pages to even start to describe how uncomperable both societies and states in those two timeframes are . 
  i 'm not saying that we should give those lands back or anything like it . 
  it is what it is , changing that border is every bit as insane of an idea as changing eastern one . 
  that being said making up lame medieval claims to them is just dumb . 
  only reason we have them is that stalin had a plan . 
  all those stories about poles supposedly ruling wroc\u0142aw at any point between 1400 and 1945 are just creations of stalinist propaganda . 
  that 's my whole point . 
  it 's simply historically incorrect . 
  and as a historian i do care about such things . 
  london was founded my romans . 
  that does n't make it an italian city . 
  also i do n't think that 's correct - beside few years under mieszko poland has n't really controlled western pomerania till xii century and that control was brief . 
  i doubt that pomeranians considered themselves poles . 
  and how would you describe wroc\u0142aw between years 1350 and 1841 ? 
  you know - that time it was a part of holy roman empire of the german nation ? 
  hmm ? 
  saying that szczecin is historically polish is about as correct claiming that moldavia or estonia are . 
  even worse since that happened even earlier . 
  even wroc\u0142aw - has n't been polish since at least ~ 1300 so it 's as irrelevant of a claim as it gets . 
  well , [ 1st voievodships were established in early 1300s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/administrative_division_of_the_polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) and we have n't stopped using the name since , if you do n't count a partition-related break , so i guess it must have transfered when moldavia were our vassal or something . 
  `` piast poland '' is just a communist propaganda construct anyway . 
  false one at that . 
  no person with even basic understanding on history should defend the notion of innate `` polishness '' of those lands . 
  not exactly true . 
  on both counts . 
  regarding 1st you have to realize pre-1945 poland was n't a nation state just like many others in europe were n't . 
  there were polish citizens of almost dozen different cultures ( germans , ukrainians , kashubs , tatars , jews , byelorussians etc. ), 
  for hundreds of years and they would not call it an occupation . 
  especially not before modern nationalisms emerged at the end of xix century . 
  and the 2nd part is also incorrect if we were to consider premises of nation-state . 
  lw\u00f3w , wilno and areas around them were predominantly polish . 
  there is a reason why far-right morons of today ca n't stop yapping about them . 
  those damn [ 1900 germans and their rabid anti-german propaganda !, 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/sprachen_deutsches_reich_1900.png ), 
  what effective ethnic cleansing would that be ? 
  have i missed something ? 
  we 've done some bad things , live any other country , do n't get me wrong , but i ca n't recall an ethnic cleansing there . 
  if you are talking about voting thing then no . 
  only parts that were german before 1772-1794 were repopulated . 
  but fact that those who were moved there from the east assumed mentality of their new neighbors is indeed very interesting . 
  i guess being uprooted to such extent also allows you to give up old habits and look at things from a fresh perspective . 
  and there is a fact of meeting both regular germans and their new western polish neighbors and realizing that world may not be all that hostile after all ? 
  or maybe if your family and traditional neighborly bonds are broken you have to depend on the state and mythical `` society '' to bigger extent and you realize that it is n't all that bad , and you can actually thrust people , rather than just your close family ?

  on the other hand those words have been around for hundreds of years , so it 's kinda neat that they vary so little even between western and southern slavs . 
  there are few ideas , but leading one says that while prussian state was aggressively anti-polish it was a country of law , unlike two other occupants that were bordering on barbarism and brutal ethnic cleansing at times . 
  that created less of an inheritable distrust in institutions and preserved old identification with polish ( but multicultural ) state , rather than polish nation that had to prevail under other occupants in times of rising nationalisms . 
  it 's kinda pointless question anyway , since we have a fully professional army and as far as auxiliary services go even volunteers from those blue regions would suffice . 
  there is literally no indication that possible next war would be wwi kind of meatgrinder requiring endless pool of manpower . 
  in old polish `` woj '' was a word for a warrior/knight , and to this day `` wodzi\u0107 '' means `` to lead '' . 
  actual word for voivodship is `` woje-w\u00f3dztwo '' and the head of it is `` woje-woda '' . 
  both words have been in use since middle ages . 
  so yes , it 's the same thing . 
  ( we pronounce our `` w '' like english `` v '' ), 
   there is some suspicion that antidepressants can make people go on a murderous rampage and autism ? 
  care to provide something that resembles a source ? 
  apparently he [ was going through a breakup ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3013743/germanwings-pilot-slipped-safety-net-devastating-consequences.html ) . 
  what a worthless piece of narcissistic shit !, 
  are those psych evals they are supposedly going through even real ? 
  i 've been told that there is not a single thing know to psychiatry that is easier to notice than narcissistic personality disorder of proportions required to do such a thing . 
  because it was n't the depression itself . 
  there has to be hundreds of depressed pilots in the air at any given time if statistics on the subject are to be believed and you do n't see them crushing into mountains . 
  as far as conservatism and religion goes , in reality it has very limited effect on things such as family and sexuality . 
  especially among younger generations . 
  i went more in-depth in the 2nd part of this post , if you 're interested : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30dxr6/recent_french_and_german_population_change/cprxlro, 
  back under communist rule situation was a bit better as far as housing goes and much better when it comes to work . 
  it was hard * not * to have a job . 
  but i do n't think that it 's the only reason . 
  people have been moving out of their family homes to get university education for two generations now . 
  you finish high school , you move to the bigger city to attend the university and either rent an apartment with few of your peers or live in the student housing . 
  you just visit your parents every few weeks or so . 
  then if you meet someone and have a longer relationship you just rent a place togather , live for a bit and few years down the line think about getting married or getting a child . 
  you rarely end up with a person from your own home town , and more often than not choose to settle away from your parents . 
  it was like that in my parent 's generation as well . 
  i actually lived with my grandma ( 2nd set of grandparents were 200km away ) , but that was considered unusual . 
  even people who had their parents ( their children 's grandparents ) in the same town lived separately ~ 90 % of the time . 
  to lesser extent in more rural areas , but even there it 's rather due to lack of means , rather than lack of desire . 
  when opportunity presents itself people just build their own house close to their parents ' . 
  and as far as religiousness goes ? 
  i do n't really know how and if it affects whole situation at all . 
  +95 % of poles are catholic , in theory , but considering oneself one and actually following the rules are two very different things . 
  you become a catholic kinda automatically , without ever having other option . 
  even in the generation of my parents most of the people do n't really care about faith , * especially * in regard to issues of family and sexuality . 
  people advocating against things like living togather/having children without marriage , or condoms/pills , or ivf are very scarce and referred to as `` catholic taliban '' . 
  and among younger generation ? 
  much more so . 
  most people just do n't care and will show up in church for weddings , funerals , christmas and sometimes even easter in order to not have to discuss it with grandparents , but that 's about it . 
  there is a religious minority , obviously . 
  ones that goes to church every sunday and whatnot , but among youngest generation that ca n't possibly be higher than 10 , * maybe * 15 % . 
  and i 'd imagine that effect of family/sexuality related teachings of catholic church are mostly limited to the most pious that group . 
  yes , it 's very concerning . 
  i 'd say it 's mostly related to how shitty job market is for young people . 
  those who are n't unemployed or severely underemployed are working on [ temporary contracts ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/c/c0/proportion_of_employees_with_a_contract_of_limited_duration%2c_age_group_15%e2%80%9364%2c_2013_%28%25_of_total_employees%29_yb15.png ) rather than full time . 
  you finish university at 25-26 and have real trouble finding a job that can pay for your needs , let alone allowing you to afford a child . 
  pay you can realistically expect to get around 30 , unless you are really doing great , emigrated or found a really superb opportunity is between 500 $ -700 $ . 
  renting z 2 room appartment that is more or less suitable for 2 people in a city will cost you +400 $ . 
  rest of the prices are pretty much the same as in the rest of europe , so if you are doing really well for 30yo , you have 1000 $ a month to cover all the expenses by you and your partner . 
  if your girlfriend does n't have a full-time job ( most people do n't ) getting pregnant means that soon enough you will have only 1 of those wages to cover your expenses . 
  and child 's .
