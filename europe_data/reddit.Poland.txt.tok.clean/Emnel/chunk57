  and so on and so forth . 
  that being said it is all my reconstruction and reasoning based on anecdotal evidence and data such as wages and employment statistics . 
  i 'm yet to find a comprehensive study on the subject . 
  no , not at all . 
  we have one of the highest % of women working in the world . 
  i do n't think i know or heard of a family where woman is n't working , beyond maternity leave , and even that has been equalized with introduction of paternity leave few years back . 
  that 's nothing . 
  i 'm 29 and off all my acquaintances as well as fb friends of similar age ( ~ 200 people total ) maybe 3 or 4 have any children . 
  having more than 2 is considered very weird even for previous generation , now is unheard of . 
  yes , but victory against usa in actual football did n't seem newsworthy , especially considering that this is the 1st football related submission i can recall . 
  depends who you consider `` progressive '' here . 
   ex-communist countries are known for lower sexual-harassment levels as well as better [ situation of women in a workplace overall ] ( http://cfile29.uf.tistory.com/image/264d453954f9964e08f441 ) including [ almost equal % of men and women in upper management ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b8kx3ce.png ) . 
  it has a lot to do with the fact that women entered workforce en masse after the wwii and stayed . 
  so while some are still getting over `` mad men '' style of things , around here there really are no working people who remember times when women did n't make ~ 50 % of the workforce . 
  there are strong local traditions too - poland as well as baltic states gave women universal right to vote , right after regaining independence in 1917 and 1918 , unlike some western nations . 
  edit : good 2015 report on that : [ achtung , pdf !, 
  ] ( http://www.grantthornton.global/globalassets/insights/ibr/ibr2015_wib_report_final.pdf ), 
   but i do n't know how to use the euro symbol it 's alt + ctrl + u ( on whatever key has $ symbol on the bottom ), 
  if 2.500 $ is consider a small fine in turkey , i can only envy you your earnings . 
  about that . 
  was n't one of the british arguments again eu army that rest of eu would n't want to intervene in case of invaded falklands ? 
  never really understood the idea behind it - why is rest of us supposed to be against an action there ? 
  yeah , i totally checked if baltic and balkan states are labeled correctly before realizing what 's actually wrong ... 
  only people who can legally be summoned , even in case of war , are those who had previous military training and said an army oath . 
  basically you need to have a * mobilization assignment * ( [ przydzia\u0142 mobilizacyjny ] ( http://www.sieradz.wku.wp.mil.pl/pl/1006.html ) ) . 
  this article is shit for not telling you that . 
  have you had basic military training ? 
  said an army oath ? 
  if no , then you * ca n't * be legally summoned even in times of war , yet alone for training . 
  basically you need to have a * mobilization assignment * ( [ przydzia\u0142 mobilizacyjny ] ( http://www.sieradz.wku.wp.mil.pl/pl/1006.html ) ) . 
  this part is simply incorrect :  the army may call up any male aged between 18 and 60 with a satisfactory medical history . 
  according to law only ones that had military training and are under oath as soldiers can be summoned . 
  since conscription that made said military training possible has been `` turned off '' for almost a decade now number of summonable reservists is pretty much limited to those who joined army on their own and left it since . 
  for example i 'm 29 , never had any military training , but have been medically evaluated 10 years ago and am considered a reservist . 
  i still ca n't be summoned according to the law . 
  i imagine that 's what causes the confusion in the media . 
  basically you need to have a * mobilization assignment * ( [ przydzia\u0142 mobilizacyjny ] ( http://www.sieradz.wku.wp.mil.pl/pl/1006.html ) ) . 
  but you * do * have control over immigration from outside eu . 
  you think those poor immigrants camp in calais because the weather is so nice ? 
  leaving eu wo n't impact neither eu-immigration nor outside immigration in any significant way . 
  not for the first 5-10 years at least , since i assume you are n't going round people up and drop them in france . 
   everyone who has come to the uk legally will be entitled to remain indefinitely , provided they live within the law of the uk . 
  after brexit , the uk should start a new points based immigration system , which is neutral as to country of origin . 
  how would that help with immigration from eu then ? 
  whoever wanted to move there , moved already . 
  those who have n't and still intend to , would probably do that before gates close . 
  idea that this is going to affect eu immigration in a significant way makes no sense whatsoever . 
  unless by `` entitled to remain indefinitely '' you mean , that they have to physically stay in uk and would lose the right to return if they left it . 
   yes . 
  this is what canada and south korea have negotiated . 
  i think the uk will also be able to negotiate it . 
  eventually ? 
  quite likely , but it would probably take years . 
  so what you guys basically want is a free access to eu market without having to participate in projects that would cost you anything and an ability to pick and choose what eu laws apply ? 
  or am i getting it wrong ? 
  and how would the resolution of that ~ ~ pes ... ~ ~ immigration problem look like ? 
  i assume it would n't be `` round 'em up and ship them to the continent '' , but what are the actual plans ? 
  it 's less of an irony and more of a pointless strawman . 
  and that 's what i 'm referring to . 
  our 80s crisis was the most brutal of all real-socialist economies . 
  by 1990 we were well behind ukraine , yet alone czechia . 
  both your statement and it 's assumed opposite are simplifications bordering on sheer idiocy . 
  if you do n't have anything substantial to add to the discussion then just do n't . 
  can title be more shamelessly editorialized ? 
  fair enough . 
  just remember that stalinism ended 28 years earlier . 
  i wondered how long would it take for someone to use it as a definitive proof that anything remotely socialist is an evil incarnate . 
  he means time before both our countries joined schengen area . 
  lines were crazy . 
  yeah !, 
  it must have cost like 1.000 $ !, 
  i understand every other mall investing in similar size decoration , but * albania * ? 
  how dare they spend such money on a nice thing ?!, 
  i 'm sure albanian government 's spending has some problems , but the damn eagle is hardly an issue worth mentioning . 
  all states need symbols , and it 's not like they are erecting 300m tall eagle or something . 
  yeah !, 
  why ca n't they just sit on the bare floor ?!, 
  it 's disgusting how much they spend on pointless luxury such as furniture . 
  hell - they even seem to have an electric light there !, 
  bastards !, 
  since when only muslims can be antisemitic ? 
  so it 's like today 's hungary on steroids ? 
  `` i guess we will benevolently join that pathetic union of yours and take your money , but do know how disgusted are we with your filthy gay-nazi ways ! '', 
  you really expect other to treat you seriously when you call people you disagree with `` faggots '' ? 
  it may impress 10-year olds , but that 's about it . 
   faggots started removing news so you are saying that ever-present gay ~ ~ nazi ~ ~ lobby is in on it ? 
  that 's even more scary !, 
   you want france to respect the deficit rules ? 
  start by making a true anti-tax avoidance policy at the european level . 
  and not a joke one headed by fucking juncker . 
      stop pretending cutting on benefits is the only way to level a budget , actually fighting parasite states like luxembourg in our midst would be much more effective and humane . 
  but of course someone like monti would rather see the humble factory worker pay the bill . 
  you are n't wrong ... 
   we signed the deal with nato 2 days ago where they can walk freely over the territory of serbia , use bases and that serbian law does n't apply to them . 
  really ? 
  that sounds a bit excessive and/or twisted by media . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
   it 's practically military occupation . 
  it would be if you assumed that if your government told nato forces to gtfo , we would have ignored that and stayed . 
  i kinda doubt that .
