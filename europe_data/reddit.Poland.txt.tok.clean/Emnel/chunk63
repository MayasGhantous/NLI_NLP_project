   poland tried a land grab in ww2 as well . 
  [ 1 ] it was a very bad decision even assuming that it only prevented germans from taking it . 
  it was n't a random land grab tho . 
  if you had read the whole article instead of focusing on spinning it , [ you 'd know that zaolzie was taken by czechoslovakia in a treacherous attack in 1919 and was followed by ethnic cleansing of poles there . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie#1918-19 ) both events were despicable , but let 's report them both , shall we ? 
    there was a western betrayal but it certainly was n't to poland . 
  yeah , right . 
  stick to \\ / r/european and \\ / r/ukip, 
  well , they 've been recently vigorously fighting against the tax fraud . 
  of pizza variety for now , but still !, 
  we have enough apples for all of you to get one , so let 's just stop there !, 
  for about 3 minutes . 
  then they have to actually use those taps . 
  [ wars have been started over less ... ] ( http://www.poster-en-kunstdrukken.nl/media/images/popup/paul-peter-rubens-urteil-des-paris-08728.jpg ), 
  statements made before any negotiations are n't worth much . 
  they can range anywhere from giving oneself room for concessions through artificial roadblocks to be sold for a big buck to attempt to bury the whole deal . 
  you ca n't really tell which is which unless you are very familiar with the subject . 
  i think that orban 's stance will be very interesting . 
  we 'll see if he is just turning tricks with putin for some quick cash or is actually going to side with him against his country 's and his allies ' interests . 
   and the poles are still using migs they bought in the warsaw pact days ( though they also have some upgraded f-16s ) . 
  actually we have 48 f-16 and 34 migs , so it 's not all * that * bad . 
  but , yeah - shit 's expensive . 
  never claimed otherwise . 
  tho i 'm much less concerned about land itself than about people who 've been driven from their homes . 
  i would n't say that no one talks about it , but as you said those border changes were accompanied with massive ethnic cleansing ( mostly deportations ) making them * fait accompli * . 
  they ca n't be reversed so there is little to no point in dwelling on it . 
  believe me - we would have given up stettin for lw\u00f3w or wilno in a heartbeat if it was that simple . 
  fun fact : in 1990 germany was refusing to sign a border treaty till poland waves rights to war reparations and other compensations . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sniper_alley ) serbian snipers killed 600 civilians there , including 225 children . 
  not into that whole `` reading an article '' thing , are we ? 
  you should look into it . 
  helps you to not look like a dumbass !, 
  it is n't a new problem . 
  polish minority in lithuania has been problematic since 1990 and the lithuanian declaration of independence . 
  they kept demanding authonomy or even revision of borders . 
  their unreasonable demands have been firmly ignored then ( poland unilaterally guaranteed polish-lithuanian border even before germany agreed on polish-german one and was the 2nd country after iceland to recognize lithuanian state ) and for the next 25 years . 
  i would n't expect a sudden change in our policy . 
  sounds reasonable . 
  and complaining along the lines of `` system is n't fair , and punishes the rich in society '' is simply moronic if everyone literally pays the same fraction of their income . 
  entitled assholes . 
  never go full retard . 
  according to eu right that 's caliphate at least 5 times over . 
  i 'm just glad few remember our inglorious contribution to the whole ugly affair . 
  there was a pretty serious one in central poland , close to my home town few years back . 
  it tore roofs of off few dozen homes in few villages , picked up and thrown cars and whatnot . 
  one-time occurrence so far , as far as i recall . 
  edit : found a video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of4fgk-qr8a, 
  all that socialism made your weather meek and content . 
   why we do n't annex portugal what kind of question is that ? 
  base tax is shit , natural resources poor , aggressive expansion would go through the roof and all those colonies make the whole affair a fucking chore . 
  coincidentally that 's exactly what a korean pretending to be estonian would say . 
  we 're like real world dwarves . 
  the right to disagree as to what european values are . 
  mostly . 
  the heart disease example was the one i was referring to in the last sentence . 
  while i 'm all for tracing historical migrations and whatnot , i 'm pretty sure we already have better ways of determining medical genetic risk factors than tracing their lineage , beyond basics such as black or white . 
  todays ' poland is the most likely ancestral homeland of all the slavs , so it would make sense , since we have n't mixed with local population after migrating , while the higher percent of other slavic nations contain slavinized locals . 
  also , our region was actually pretty damn stable compared to parts of balkans and russia , when looking at last ~ 2000 years as a whole . 
  disclaimer : while i am a historian i never really delved into this topic hard enough to be certain about what i just said . 
  i 've heard such theories from reputable sources , but they may have been either proven or disproved since then . 
  either way your argument makes no sense whatsoever . 
  sure . 
   for years ? 
   ) ) constitutional tribunal was established by communist government and dictator jaruzelski `` minutes '' before they were supposed to `` lose '' power . 
  it is communist relict you 're right . 
  it was established in 1982 , mere 4.204.800 minutes before jaruzelski lost power in 1990 . 
  also 9 out of 12 current judges including rzepli\u0144ski were voted in with pis help , so the stupidity of coming out now saying that those people they were voting for few years back are some kind of `` communist stooges '' is beyond moronic . 
  the real problem here is that the reality has a serious leftist bias . 
  constitution . 
  have you read it ? 
  https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/konstytucja_rzeczypospolitej_polskiej/rozdzia%c5%82_8 like it or not it is the law of the land . 
  has been for years . 
  so unless you feel like implementation good old [ people 's courts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people's_court_%28germany%29 ) is in order to `` save democracy '' get the fuck back in line . 
  i would refrain from calling it a dictatorship . 
  they are both trying to bend a low and breaking it by trying to impose their will via fait accompli , but they have not responded to all the pushback they are getting with attempted use of violence . 
  and there is quite a lot of pushback including , as we can see here , basically whole of the judicial branch contesting them . 
  and , to be honest , i very , very much doubt they are even capable of doing so . 
  it took them months to find a high ranking police officer interested in the chief of police job under their rule . 
  and military brass , while hardly left-leaning , is both rather centrist and finding pis dangerously incompetent ( according to several people i know who have military families ) . 
  and i think that pis realizes that the first attempt to violently silence opposition will probably be their last . 
  fun fact : current minister of defense antoni macierewicz actually attempted a coup in 1992 and even then , in far more volatile times , military promptly ignored him . 
  while that 's all true it does n't make the points they made invalid . 
  this film never claims that pis is directly behind it all . 
  they claim that their ( in ) actions contribute to the developing brown wave . 
  [ nor and so do i ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gf6zp/portuguese_student_victim_of_racist_attack_in/d2hcyp0 ) . 
  also , on top of what / u/lared930 said judicial system in poland has an anglosaxon spin to it where rulings by the supreme court are binding ( - ish ) precedents to the lower courts for future rulings in similar cases . 
  so this is basically a guideline for all the courts in the land to contest government 's actions on that matter . 
   it 's not . 
  the one-sided selection of people commenting on the events gives it right away . 
  like the commie winnicki ? 
   there is absolutely no comparison to the 90 's , when naziskins and nationalists were on their rise . 
  it 's different . 
  at the time it was mostly a thoughtless excuse for violence . 
  mostly against other subcultures too . 
  there was no acceptance for racist slurs in public discourse and actual hostility and violence against foreigners on the streets . 
   i have to ask ... how exactly does slavic neo-nazism work ? 
  just like any other , really . 
  you are insecure , not very bright , watch/listen to/read some absurdly biased shit that focuses your anger at the others . 
  done and done, 
  that 's a nice thought , but i do n't think anyone is brigading there .
