   in another words you are entitled and justified to pick the version [ ... ] and ignore the fact that there are no solid evidence to support your version . 
  no , i 'm only justify to pick a version that makes the most sense , just like in a trial . 
  the only difference is that the bar below which i have to say `` it 's impossible to tell '' is , for obvious reasons , lower than in an actual trial for a crime that happened contemporarily . 
  it 's not me talking here . 
  it 's over 100 years of scientific theory applied to academic history . 
  this is how almost everything you read about in your school history books got there . 
  there are very , very few `` historical facts '' that are supported by the amount and quality of evidence you demand here . 
   pick the version that serves your left-leaning it 's ipn 's version . 
  ipn 's !, 
  are you seriously saying that a bloody ipn is a part of some left-wing conspiracy ? 
  also please replace '' \u0141upaszka '' with `` bandera '' in our discussion and read it again . 
  does it still feel right ? 
   do you really think that current government is fascist , racist and etc ist things ? 
  that was never the topic of this discussion . 
  no i do n't think that current government is racist or fascist . 
  few people here and there are at least heavily xenophobic but for the whole government it is not the case . 
  they do , however , are at least enablers it all . 
  out of political cynicism and stupidity most likely , but they are slowly , but surely approaching the point where their actions are harder and harder to explain by sheer idiocy and blindness ( speaking about the burial of '' \u0141upaszka '' here - putting that creature in the same raw as pilecki is a fucking disgrace ) . 
  and do not try to convince me that po is at fault here too . 
  while pis is an enabler they are a fucking wet nurse of all of this . 
  it 's their moronic economic policies and ineptitude that are the top reason behind this brown wave . 
  but they were n't at least enabling the fruits of their labor . 
  tl ; dr. pis government not fascist . 
  fascism and racism on the rise , thanks to pis now and po before . 
  it 's history , not a trial . 
  there is no `` beyond reasonable doubt '' in a court sense . 
  if in history you have 2 conflicting stories and one of them is both way , way better sourced and makes more sense in the frame it is in , then that version is history till proven otherwise . 
  i may not like ipn for a lot of things ( being a left-leaning person and an actual historian ) but cases they made about both `` bury '' and '' \u0141upaszka '' are both very solid . 
  also , it 's a bloody ipn , it 's not really much wiggle room to the right of it , is there ? 
  edit : also - there are enough `` cursed soldiers '' that were n't ethnically motivated murderers , in case you did n't know . 
  and yet current government decides to go with this brown flow and support this fascist-like cult of a pair of traitors . 
  all the information is there - they either do n't care or actually endorse this . 
  it 's a fucking disgrace to put those 2 creatures arm in arm with people such as pilecki . 
  tells a lot about the quality of our `` patriotic youth '' too . 
  [ good english-language documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tafqx31m0tw ) by al jazeera about the recent rise of racism in poland . 
  sadly it 's painfully accurate . 
  do not look at yt comments . 
  is an admission by a government official responsible for monitoring such things enough ? 
  http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/artykul/1592364,rpo-w-ostatnim-czasie-nasilila-sie-w-polsce-nienawisc-wobec-cudzoziemcow have you tried '' [ beating foreigner ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=pobili+imigranta#q=pobity+cudzoziemiec&amp;tbs=qdr:m ) '' ? 
  this search is limited to the last month . 
  [ here you have a statement by prof. pankowski ] ( https://youtu.be/tafqx31m0tw?t=15m30s ) from `` never again '' ( ngo dealing with racism ) saying that they notice a significant increase . 
  on top of that you have instances of onr being invited to schools , holding parades , burning jewish effigies and so on while government enshrines war criminals such as `` bury '' and '' \u0141upaszka '' . 
  are you really saying that nothing has changes due to current government 's inaction ( and , as with supporting a cult of those two murderous traitors , actions ) ? 
  for example by [ burying war criminals responsible for ethnic cleansing with honors ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4g9lf4/poland_buries_remains_of_world_war_ii_resistance/ ) . 
  they literally enshrined the only two ( with `` bury '' ) out of hundreds of home army commanders that almost definitely are guilty of murdering civilian men , women and children . 
  based on their ethnicity too . 
  to go more fascist than that in this kind of thing they would have to start rehabilitating szmalcownicy . 
  those are n't `` buzzwords '' . 
  if you run around calling people with darker skin `` brudas '' , you 're a racist . 
  if you march in a goosestep in brown uniforms , dark ties and a band with a nationalistic symbol on your arm you 're [ a fascist ] ( http://m.natemat.pl/0064d16f58fd571ea2a9cb0a490ac67a,640,0,0,0.jpg ) . 
  and yes - both are on the rise around here as of late . 
  so according to you wo\u0142y\u0144 was n't a big deal either ? 
  sadly neither of those . 
  a traitor and a war criminal . 
  a traitor and a murderer of civilian men , women and children . 
  fact that he was executed by communist regime does n't change a fact that he very much deserved the noose . 
  he ignored a direct order from home army command to not act against lithuanians after a murder on polish civilians performed by them in a village of [ glinciszki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glinciszki_massacre ) and [ massacred a village of dubiangiai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dubingiai_massacre ) killing , according to most recent findings , between 67 and 87 civilians including women and children as young as 1 . 
  whole thing is well documented by notoriously right-wing and vitriolically anti-communist [ institute of national remembrance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/institute_of_national_remembrance ) ( atm they are trying to remove xix century polish socialists as street patrons in an `` decommunisation '' effort ) for example [ here ] ( http://pamiec.pl/pa/tylko-u-nas/15322,zbrodnia-dubinska-a-major-lupaszkoquot.html ) , in case someone has any doubts . 
  fact that such a creature gets a ceremonial burial is a fucking disgrace and a spit in the face of actual heroes of home army . 
  i 'm using / r/smartflix , but now they ended their free service so i 'm not sure i 'll be sticking to either . 
  i hardly watch it anyway . 
  38th wave of feminism is n't really a thing in europe the way it is in us . 
  in my very left-wing and very feminist circles there are literally no people who favor clinton over sanders due to his sex . 
  it 's a non-topic . 
  not that we know of . 
  it is likely that there were members of other nationalities involved , but in an insignificant amounts . 
  also i think that the perception difference when it comes to use of word `` german '' when describing those atrocities comes from linguistic differences . 
  in english it is quite common to keep repeating the same noun in following sentences or even in the same one . 
  in polish you ca n't do that without sounding like a 6yo , so even a short text about such topic words `` german '' , `` nazi '' , `` hitlerist '' ( pol . 
  hitlerowiec , a follower of hitler ( 's ideology ) ) are used as semi-synonymous . 
  [ warsaw ghetto uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_ghetto_uprising ) started 73 years ago today . 
  people of warsaw commemorate this tragic struggle by wearing paper [ jonquils ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narcissus_jonquilla ) ( daffodils ) , popular spring flowers that resemble [ star of david signs ] ( http://imgur.com/wu3hq6i ) jews were forced to wear under occupation . 
  event is coordinated by the [ museum of history of polish jews ] ( http://www.polin.pl/en ), 
  nice . 
  welcome !, 
  this . 
  the influx of romanian roma and disenfranchised romanians in early '90s was what made the connection . 
  we already had a big roma population in poland that was fairly well integrated and actually decently liked , so the newcomers were linked to their romanian roots . 
  to the point that by 1995 or so rumun ( male romanian ) started to also mean a beggar and rumunka ( female romanian ) - a cheap prostitute . 
  stop . 
  please . 
  all i have to say is that when one uses a word `` intelligent '' 3 times in a row in a discussion he or she should stop speaking , fade away from the debate and go do some serious thinking about themselves . 
  the video you refer to was actually pretty damn good , especially with that faintly ominous ending , while that had little to no artistic value . 
  i have no idea why anyone would want to pull the video in question . 
  is it ? 
  i actually like it a lot . 
  or kaczy\u0144ski has a secret crush on zandberg and wants razem in power by 2018 . 
  still , there have to be better ways of achieving that . 
  people willingly mistaking explanations for excuses really start to get on my nerves ... 
  it 's pillow-craft in polish , 
  well , obviously . 
  or by several such organizations . 
  how does that conflict with the 1st definition ? 
  but complaining about them does ? 
  and that is supposed to be a job for a random guy on fb or reddit ? 
  while right-wingers go out to beat up a random indian guy . 
  for freedom !, 
  it takes a brown to keep the brown in check !, 
  sure , but what is the desired response here , then ? 
  are n't they ?
