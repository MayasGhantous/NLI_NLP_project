  tho i 'm not sure if current turkish government even wants that . 
  they help him galvanize the population in a big way . 
  why ? 
  do you see a reasonable solution of is problem that does n't involve supporting kurds ? 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  i 'm honestly asking - i 'd love to hear any possible good solution . 
  turkey is the main reason noting has been done about isis during last 12 months or so . 
  it 's especially apparent in us policy . 
  they keep sayign that it 's very sad that people get brutally murdered in isis-controlled territory , but since seriously supporting only possible solution - kurds would put strain on turkey-us relations they are just pretending they 're doing something . 
  like that absurd program to train `` syrian rebels '' that yielded 4 ( four ! ), 
  fighters after tens of millions of dollars spent . 
  or bombings . 
  is is no serbia , they wo n't be bombed into submission and without serious military cooperation with the troops on the ground ( be it iraqi or kurdish ) such as officer-advisors on every level of command structure all the way to the front line there is no way to perform tactical bombings that will successfully support a land advance . 
  especially when it comes to iraqi army that in last few months was known to call us airstrikes on hospitals , is-opposed sunni militias or even kurds . 
  sad part is that eu will probably just keep playing along instead of taking step back and realizing that at this point only way of getting rid of isis is to force kurds , iraqi , turkey and even assad to come to agreement on how to split is territory in aftermath of coordinated , eu/us supported offensive . 
  but since turkey would rather see all of the syria burned than to agree to independent kurdistan on their borders ... that being said ppk is making it much easier for them . 
  well , depends on what you mean saying `` socialism '' . 
  it 's the same thing as with capitalism - if you take it to extreme it will become very damaging to the society and fail in spectacular fashion . 
  the main difference between east and west during the cold war was the fact that west was significantly less prone to ignoring reality for the benefit of ideology . 
  one could argue that capitalism in many parts of the world is currently in a state of ideology-induced blindness communism was in 60s and 70s . 
  could n't agree more . 
  it 's so nice to see that some people still do some thinking before posting around here . 
  makes comments like this look like jewels in heap easy oversimplifications this sub has become . 
  well , that guy really is a clown . 
  along with quite a few others in the new government . 
  still , i very much doubt any other group will match them with barbarity of their actions on lands they control . 
  something has to be done about them . 
  that being said usual airstrikes wo n't be enough , unless they are followed by troops on the ground . 
  and eu or nato invasion seems like a very bad idea . 
  only reasonable solution at this point is to support neighboring powers - kurds , iraq and even assad and turkey and split the land now controlled by daesh between them . 
  in a very close cooperation with eu providing `` advisors '' , funding and firepower . 
  that would , however , require pressuring turkey to recognize independent kurdistan - an issue that proved so troublesome for us and it 's allies , that they literally have n't lifted a finger to deal with daesh for over a year now because of it . 
  or we can , just like us , keep considering preservation of turkish delusions of grandeur much more important than w/e daesh is doing to people of syria and iraq . 
  cool . 
  as a historian specializing in ancient history , so someone who actually knows the 1st thing about the decline of roman empire i can not agree with you enough . 
  and i can assure anyone that roman empire was n't brought down but atrocious journalism either , so we 're probably safe on that front as well . 
  `` whip '' ... yeah , sure ... whatever is ones view on eu or anything else at leat have a fucking decency to not make such a abysmal tragedy about your own tiny , selfish goals . 
  for a few fucking hours at least . 
  ca n't do that , huh ? 
  to misquote a classic : `` poland missed a golden opportunity to keep its trap shut '', 
  government would be toppled withing days . 
  we really enjoy both tea and coffee . 
  people from different countries always looked at me funny when i was drinking hot tea with temperature close to 40 ^ o c. 
  most of muslims in france immigrated there from former french colonies few generations ago . 
  they are , however , heavily ghettoized . 
  it 's much more complicated . 
  muslims integrated much better in other european countries when they were n't pushed into getto-like suburbs and treated as 2nd class ( ok , more like 1,1 , but still ) citizens for decades . 
  it 's a long standing problem that just reemerged due to isis threat . 
  things like that tend to differ a lot on region to region basis . 
  / u/ajuc explained it perfectly . 
  he 's polish mccarthy . 
  and his obsession is outright counterproductive since when faced with criticism or accusations russians can point and his numerous retarded actions and sow doubt . 
  it 's literally `` boy who cried wolf '' , but on the international scale . 
  also i would n't trust this guy with a bb gun and he 's just been given serious control over polish armed forces . 
  fuckign travesty , especially since when rumors that he 's supposed to be a next mod surfaced few weeks back pis outright declared that he wo n't get that job . 
  not in a million years . 
  time sure flies , i guess . 
  it is much worse than i 've imagined ... ** ministry of justice ** : * zbigniew ziobro * . 
  he was moj in previous pis government and proved to be extremely overzealous and partisan organizing borderline political witch-hunts and anti-corruption hysteria that yielded no results beyond the substantial damage . 
  ** ministry of defense ** : * antoni macierewicz * arguably mentally unstable conspiracy theorist that is considered absurdly russo-phobic by polish standards . 
  ** ministry of environment ** : * jan szyszko * . 
  while moe in previous pis government he was pushing for building a highway through the primeval forest area of [ rospuda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rospuda ) , wants to fight eu-imposed hunting restrictions , thinks that `` scientists are divided on climate change '' and apparently believes in chemitrails . 
  ** ministry of science and higher education ** : * jaros\u0142aw gowin * . 
  wants to end publicly financed higher education . 
  ceo of one of the biggest banks as well as the head of the board of directors of the biggest polish business lobby organization : konfederacja lewiatan . 
  hardline neo-liberal , just like gowin . 
  ** secret services coordinator ** : * mariusz kami\u0144ski * ex-head of infamous anti-corruption bureau . 
  an agency created by previous pis government and a main tool of political witch-hunts organized by ziobro . 
  had hardly any success finding actual corruption and performed massive sting operations trying to corrupt low level po members . 
  he 's been sentenced to 3 years in prison for his actions as a head of that agency . 
  moi and mofa are n't much better . 
  keep in mind that in campaign pis was n't showing any of those faces and went with left-wing economic platform . 
  fun times , 
  not the one to defend kaczynski , but that was an agreement signed by the previous government . 
  oh , stop being so sensitive . 
  no wonder people always liked czechs better . 
  i 'm more surprised by \u015awietokrzystkie , of all things , being the most pro-eu . 
  absolutely terrible idea that creates an illusion that an attempt to deal with a problem is being made while in reality wasting resources and political capital that could have been used on something that can actually help . 
  it should be used in books as an example or government regulation done wrong . 
  resurrected comrade mao . 
  obviously . 
  every 3 months - if the term will be shorter they wo n't get all the money . 
  either way it covers basic party 's expenses and allows to expand pretty easily . 
  this nitpicking and being slaves to the facts is getting really annoying . 
  start acting like a proper major eu media , will you ? 
  they ruled not even 2 and ended in opposition for 8 years afterwards . 
  i guess the way i phrased it was n't clear . 
  actually that 's exactly marxist style socialism . 
  not to be confused with ( marxist - ) leninist type . 
  right . 
  kinda proves my point tho . 
  not exclusively , since they won in all age brackets , but youth vote was what kept them out of power in previous election . 
  this time they got * a lot * of it . 
  there are several reasons . 
  first of all so called left ( mostly post-communists ) ruled supreme in late 1990s and early 2000s but their governance was plagued by corruption scandals and sharp turn to neo-liberalism , going to war in iraq , cia prisons , lowering corporate taxes , dismantling safety nets , compromising with catholic church and so on . 
  in eyes of many left-wing voters they were and are only left-wing by name . 
  because of all that their support ( 41 % of the votes in elections ) took a nose dive and never went over 15 % again . 
  in next two parliaments socialist left alliance still existed , but traditional left wing agendas have been split between 2 other parties : progressive agenda was taken by economically liberal ruch palikota , later tw\u00f3j ruch , and socially economical one by conservative law and justice ( pis ) . 
  sld ( social democratic alliance ) reacted by doing nothing but posturing and occasional pr stunts trying to cater to all types of voters at once alienating them all equally . 
  whenever actuall leaders of the party ( old post-communists ) opened their mouth it was obvious that they have nothing in common with modern left .
