  sad thing about iraq and afghanistan failure that i was from start to finish against is the fact that it had amazing effects on state of polish army that are impossible to ignore . 
  tens of thousands of soldiers took part in actual war , hundreds of changes were implemented to equipment and so on . 
   how exactly can poland be better than germany regarding tanks and submarines ? 
  while i would n't go as far as claim that [ polish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_equipment_of_the_polish_land_forces#vehicles ) army is more powerful than [ german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_equipment_of_the_german_army#vehicles ) atm , actually amounts of tanks and their quality are quite similar and expected to tilt to polish favor in following years when more leopards will be acquired . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ then ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ strike !, 
   what 's their stance on religion and separation of church and state ? 
  no money from the state to the church , no religion classes in schools , full equality for lgbt individuals and couples , more lax abortion laws etc. 
  overall separation of church and state . 
  focus is on economic side of things tho . 
  there actually is a sizable amount of christian-left members that usually support those ideas , but are against excessive church-bashing , some of the more atheist members would like to perform from time to time . 
   since it is not talked about much in this sub , refugees ? 
  support for scaling up of the recent eu program that focuses on help in countries bordering syria , while accepting higher amounts of refugees that are already in europe in solidarity with eu border countries . 
  i attended a debate organized by razem on the topic two weeks ago and discussion on possible actions was quite broad from ways to help refugees , through ways stopping of the mediterranean disaster ( easier ways of getting refugee status in m-e countries , pressure on countries like turkey wil quid pro quo in form of serious eu funding for refugee camps ) to even discussion on limited eu military action in syria ( without the us ) as one of the ways of stabilizing it . 
   what is the background from the members ? 
  for example , in podemos a lot of people come from academia , and most of them from the social sciences . 
  there is a lot of academia , without a doubt , and most of them are indeed from social sciences ( from sociology through history to law ) , but there is also quite a lot of economists and tech professors as well as simple tech professionals . 
  in warsaw , for example , for some reason over 20 % of the party members are various it professionals . 
  hehehehe, 
  decent-ish voter preference test can be found here : http://www.latarnikwyborczy.pl/ my results : http://i.imgur.com/zcepfao.png, 
  yeah , i mean pi\u0142sudski and his pps was a blight in early 20s . 
  yeah ... thankfully those guys get like 0,2 % and are more of a comedic relief than anything , but i simply ca n't imagine anyone actually voting for them in a serious manner . 
  not at the moment , but i 'll ask around - translation was supposed to happen at some point . 
  the actual program as a whole has n't been presented to the public yet ( will be this weekend ) , but here are the basis of it that were decided on when party formed in may [ ( in polish tho ) ] ( http://partiarazem.pl/program/ ) . 
  it 's quite similar to what parties such a british labour or other eu social-democrats would present but with podemos-ish spin . 
  most of the subjects are quite poland-specific tho , so i do n't even know how possible to translate are they . 
  . edit : feel free to ask about specific subjects , i 'll try to answer to my abilities . 
  then vote razem - they are going against mainstream ideas , but at least have a brain and solutions , instead of `` the jews did it ! '', 
     on a left there 's united left but with too leftist programme for my liking , we are too poor country to afford having someone like that in a government . 
  if you take a look at recent history of scandinavia , you will see that they were much , much poorer than we are atm when they started to build their welfare states . 
  they being rich is basically a byproduct of fighting squalor . 
  and while i would n't believe sld and their puppets for a second i do think that razem has a good plan on how to enrich the country without turning us more and more into a glorified sweatshop . 
  their full program will be unveiled next week , so take a look . 
  and petru - i 've read the whole program , and it looks like they took a bunch of polls on what poles like to hear and think is important and just put as much of it together without any underlying plan for the country . 
  it 's grzegorz braun and his merry band of utter retards that would make korwin blush . 
  what you wrote here makes no sense , especially in context of the post you 're responding to . 
  can you reiterate ? 
  as a source of amusement , perhaps . 
  edit : to explain this bit : korwin followers are commonly referred to as `` kuce '' that translates to `` ponies '' . 
  mikolaj5748 claims here that `` ponies were always more useful than donkeys '' . 
  hard to tell . 
  polls place them between 1 % and 3 % , but so far only ~ 15 % of population even knows of their existence ( party has few months ) , so it depends if they manage to break through to mass media . 
  it should be doable , since only 7 parties managed to gather enough signatures to compete in the whole country , so it 's not like they can be ignored ad infinitum . 
  i really hope that you 're joking . 
  especially about the 1st part . 
  all of them , really . 
  although some are really , really bad anyway . 
  not nearly as delusional as those guys tho . 
  same here . 
  i know quite a few people who worked on their program ( i helped here and there myself ) and they are one of the smartest and most levelheaded people i know . 
  their program is very coherent , fact-based , rooted in reality and , above else , they actually intend to go through with it . 
  `` i do n't know what 's in ttip , but i 'm for it . '', 
  so it 's between actual morons and cynical pricks stupidifying the politics and population for their own gain ? 
  perfect . 
  the ultimate answer to `` how to end usa ( or at least its worldwide significance ) ? '', 
  question . 
  while i 'm sure everyone in this thread is an expert on fire stations , conditions within them and their suitability for such use , i 'd imagine , that bloody psl ( a member of a ruling coalition and a party ~ 90 % of firefighters belong to ) knows those things at least a tad better . 
  or perhaps not - this sub seems consider itself the top expert on everything these days , after all . 
  that 's one impressively stupid comparison . 
  once you study history you realize that almost all the wars were effect of polish conspiracies . 
  actually it was supposed to be a higherpower-atheist-mason-thingy temple , originally and a thanksgiving [ after adoption of the constitution of may 3rd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temple_of_divine_providence#first_polish_republic ) . 
  the interesting part is that [ sta\u0144czyk was an actual person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sta%c5%84czyk ) . 
  a jester-philosopher kind of figure - true creature of renaissance at its peak . 
  -- `` by any measure sta\u0144czyk 's fame and legend were already strong during his own time , the renaissance . 
  the popularity later reappeared in 19th century and remained well-known to present times . 
  [ 4 ] unlike jesters of other european courts , sta\u0144czyk has been always considered to have been much more than a mere entertainer . 
  [ 6 ] he is remembered as a man of great intelligence and a political philosopher gifted with formidable insight into poland 's current and future situation . 
  he used his job to criticize and warn his contemporaries by the use of satire . 
  his witty jokes often pertained to current political or court matters . 
  sta\u0144czyk 's remarks and jokes were preserved by numerous contemporary writers and historians , including \u0141ukasz g\u00f3rnicki , jan kochanowski , marcin kromer , and miko\u0142aj rej who praised him for fighting hypocrisy in the name of truth . 
  some sources even go as far as to call him a `` personal friend to marcin kromer , to the dislike of the bishops '' . 
  [ 7 ] the best known anecdote about sta\u0144czyk is that of a hunting incident . 
  in 1533 king sigismund the old had a huge bear brought for him from lithuania . 
  the bear was released in the forest of niepo\u0142omice near krak\u00f3w so that the king could hunt it . 
  during the hunt , the animal charged at the king , the queen and their courtiers which caused panic and mayhem . 
  queen bona fell from her horse which resulted in her miscarriage . 
  later , the king criticized sta\u0144czyk for having run away instead of attacking the bear . 
  the jester is said to have replied that `` it is a greater folly to let out a bear that was already in a cage . '', 
  this remark is often interpreted as an allusion to the king 's policy toward prussia which was defeated by poland but not fully incorporated into the crown . '', 
  well ... we have n't really stolen anything tho , have we ? 
  [ volhynia , podlasia and kiev voivodeships were incorporated into the crown on king 's orders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_lublin#sejm_of_1569 ) . 
  and he legally owned them ( being a feudal monarch in lithuania ) . 
  local nobility was all for it too . 
  sure it was a dick/badass move ( depending on how you look at it ) , but we 're kinda blameless here . 
  hell , even the king was lithuanian  for those interested : [ before . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/poland_and_lithuania_in_1526.png ) [ after . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/irp1569.jpg ), 
  nonsense . 
  he got ~ 8 % of the black vote compared to projected 5 % . 
  taking into account the % of black voters that 's ~ 0,3 % popular vote . 
  even less in most of the key states . 
  that has not made a difference . 
  what made the difference is the middle and higher class voting for trump with only poorest ( [ < $ 50k/year ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html ) ) americans being more for clinton . 
  i mean ... 
  he has n't done shit for 8 years to fix the whole police shootings situation , so it 's actually very fitting . 
  cnn reports that clinton phoned trump to concede . 
  it 's over indeed . 
  funnier way to go about it would be some rep. electors voting for clinton . 
  i 'm starting to think that this election was rigged by brits . 
  honestly the more i think about the sorry state of us politics the more all the roads lead to the 2 party system . 
  it was bad before but with all the catalysts of social media news bubbles , info-entertainment and economical strife you 're reached the rock bottom .
