  uncivilized people , i tell you !, 
  i do n't get you man . 
  they literally bloody said that they plan to do it . 
  poor pis !, 
  they 're saying things and people just go and criticize them over it !, 
  wolfs , not people that razem !, 
  quick google search reveals both a number of press reports on that as well as polish websites of slovak and german clinics . 
  and neither kaczy\u0144ski nor the pm endorsed it , right ? 
  and neither kaczy\u0144ski nor the pm endorsed it , right ? 
  well , razem supports the other bill , but since no party in parlament does it 's kinda pointless , is n't it ? 
  and since they are a political party with their own program ( such as laxer abortion laws ) and their goal is to get to power and implement them they kinda have to present their ideas to the voters , do n't they ? 
  that 's the point of being a political party . 
  and if pis pulls something like that while other opposition parties ca n't be bothered to say anything beyond `` we support the consensus '' it would be madness for razem not to tear pis a new one over it . 
  then if pis wants to play it they can be sure that we will do our best to match them . 
  especially , since a danger that socially-minded people will start considering razem over them is something that may actually get their attention . 
  in best case scenario they are just blowing the cathotaliban for some support while women are used as a bargaining tool . 
  we should totally be ok with that !, 
  yeah , yeah , yeah - it 's all just fun and games . 
  relax and believe that pis is a reasonable party that will do the right thing despite officially claiming otherwise . 
  whole this protesting thing is just plain mean !, 
  the project in question would ban abortions even in situations where the fetus has no chance of survival , the pregnancy is a result of a rape or the life of a women is in danger . 
  it also included jail time for pregnancy termination as well as `` endangering pregnancy '' for up to 2 years , for both pregnant women and a doctor . 
  it was proposed by super-conservative ngos such as pro-life . pl and [ ordo iuris ] ( http://www.en.ordoiuris.pl/ ) and many politicians of the ruling party as well as parts of conservative parliamentary opposition declared their support . 
  that includes both the pm - [ beata szyd\u0142o ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beata_szyd%c5%82o ) , the president [ andrzej duda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrzej_duda ) and the real power behind them - the leader of [ law and justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_and_justice ) , [ jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaros%c5%82aw_kaczy%c5%84ski ) . 
  depending on the question asked the support for the bill is between 14 % ( question : `` should the abortion law be stricter ? '' ), 
  and 11 % ( question : `` should the abortion be allowed it cases of rape and the life-threatening pregnancy '' ) . 
  the protest has started yesterday when left-wing [ razem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/razem ) party appealed to people to dress in black and post their photos on social media in order to gather momentum for the demonstration in front of the sejm today afternoon ( 5pm ) when the bill will be proceeded . 
  hashtag #czarnyprotest had a range of 7 million yesterday alone with thousands of people posting their pictures . 
  young and old , from cities and small towns , in many situations whole whole high school classes etc. 
  shortly after the second citizen-proposed bill that among other things proposed abortion on demand in first 12 weeks was thrown out outright ( 230 to 154 ) and is now dead . 
  third , less know project changing the law on how in vitro fertilization can be conducted ( adding unscientific changes that will make to both more costly and dangerous while much less effective ) was n't thrown out either ( 170 to 252 ) and will continue its legislative path . 
  done and done . 
  abortion clinics in slovakia and eastern germany have been employing polish speaking stuff for years . 
  i 'm not saying we should travel back in time and make sure that catholicism never existed , but i 'd argue that it had a decent run and it should probably quit while it 's still somewhat ahead .

  well , there have been quite a few demonstrations and marches over it in previous months . 
  next one will be today at 5pm in front of the sejm building . 
  so it 's more about using social media to amplify the message . 
  for poland i found and [ extensive report [ pdf ] ] ( https://www.nik.gov.pl/plik/id,10217,vp,12540.pdf ) by [ supreme audit office ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_audit_office_ ( poland ) for 2014 and 1st half of 2015 ( 18 months total ) and according to it there were : 185 instance of police gun use ( 123/year ) in 19 of those people got wounded ( 12/year ) in 2 people got killed . 
  ( 1.3 / year ) . 
  data includes all gun use on duty including warning shots , but also shots fired at animals . 
  be it dangerous ones or fatally wounded , for example in car accidents . 
  look at that !, 
  we reached the point when intelligently and scientifically * looking * publications categorize political movements as either authoritarian or not based on having `` an authoritarian view of the market '' . 
  remember kids - podemos is literally franco . 
  what a time to live in !, 
  i know , right ? 
  why the hell is n't the area around the wound properly shaved ? 
  and have they used yarn ? 
  i 'm good . 
  carry on . 
  11 % of the country supports this change . 
  still too much by 11 % , but ... 
  one was after that bombing of hdp youth camp last year and two earlier this year . 
  i 'm not sure about the origins of kurdish diaspora here . 
  probably some communist era exchanges couples with later emigration from turkey . 
  i was at a few such kurdish demonstrations with few hundred people ( not counting locals ) , so unless they were turks playing dress-up ... 
  good to hear !, 
  while we are n't always paragons of liberty here , kurds have marched through warsaw multiple times flying pyd and ppk banners and no one batted an eye . 
  despite many being outright hysterically against symbols such as reds stars and hammers with sickles , so i always kind of expected shitstorm on those grounds . 
  than erdogan ? 
  all of them , really . 
  i was n't aware that kurdish culture is split into factions , tho . 
  if he was in razem and ever showed such behavior he would have been kicked out faster than ziemkiewicz does research . 
  and he seems pretty damn unable to control himself . 
  source : i 've been in razem from the get go . 
  ugh , / r/nottheonion ... what a cunt . 
  how so ? 
  do n't know the guy and he seems like an utter moron , but i would n't believe dunkenpl on that communist angle either - for him everything left of hardcore libertarian is communist . 
  you realize that there are dozens if not hundreds of polish stamps with much less known fictional characters , right ? 
  there have been for decades . 
  source : my grandfather has been collecting stamps for over 50 years . 
  not exactly . 
  i actually support a tax reform that would introduce a heavy tax progression in poland that would increase my tax burden , while lowering it for people who earn less . 
  and i definitely support harsher measures against both tax dodgers and tax avoiders . 
  well , you 're paying , i 'm paying ... 
  what kinds of laws are we talking here ? 
  i 'm pretty sure most countries do have laws enabling counterespionage as well as laws ruling the financing of political parties and disclosure of it . 
  you may want to read the 2nd sentence of my comment in a context of the 1st one . 
  there was an implied '' , considering '' after the `` amazing job '' part . 
  and i 'd argue that you mistake a simple refusal to accept the corrupt and damaging status quo as a proper state of things for a nativity . 
  also , accusations of naivety are in as poor of a taste as accusations of stupidity , since due to the nature of them the accused has no power to refute them , in a logical sense . 
  it is a very lazy way to go about a discussion , and you may want to refrain from doing that . 
  you seem to imply that my disgust negatively affects my cognitive skills in that regard . 
  how so ? 
  that would require him to outright acknowledge his role in the tax avoidance business . 
  something that he 's been denying so far . 
  very eloquent way of committing a political suicide , tho !, 
  i mean , you 're not entirely wrong in ireland about it , but how about using that anger to push against those other tax haven practices , rather than to just push back . 
  since you are very much in the wrong there as well . 
  well , that 's literally her first such interview . 
  sure , she 's no oriana fellaci there , but i 'd say that she 's done an outright amazing job so going on and on about how amateurish she was seems mighty condescending to me .
