  speaking of wwi . 
  if you feel like you need to brush up on its history you have to check out [ the great war channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/thegreatwar ) on youtube . 
  you get few minute episode every week summarizing events exactly 100 years after they happened . 
  it really is very well done . 
  good thing for wrong reasons . 
  i 'll take it . 
   the first extensive jewish emigration from western europe to poland occurred at the time of the first crusade in 1098 . 
  under boles\u0142aw iii ( 1102 -- 1139 ) , the jews , encouraged by the tolerant regime of this ruler , settled throughout poland , including over the border in lithuanian territory as far as kiev . 
  [ 30 ] boles\u0142aw iii recognized the utility of jews in the development of the commercial interests of his country . 
  jews came to form the backbone of the polish economy . 
  mieszko iii employed jews in his mint as engravers and technical supervisors , and the coins minted during that period even bear hebraic markings . 
  [ 28 ] jews worked on commission for the mints of other contemporary polish princes , including casimir the just , boles\u0142aw i the tall and w\u0142adys\u0142aw iii spindleshanks . 
  [ 28 ] jews enjoyed undisturbed peace and prosperity in the many principalities into which the country was then divided ; they formed the middle class in a country where the general population consisted of landlords ( developing into szlachta , the unique polish nobility ) and peasants , and they were instrumental in promoting the commercial interests of the land . 
   another factor for the jews to emigrate to poland were the magdeburg rights , or magdeburg law , a charter given to the jews , among others , that specifically outlined the rights and privileges that jews had coming into poland . 
  for example , they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies . 
  this made it very attractive for jewish communities to pick up and move to poland . 
  -  in 1332 , king casimir iii the great ( 1303 -- 1370 ) amplified and expanded boles\u0142aw 's old charter with the wi\u015blicki statute . 
  under his reign , streams of jewish immigrants headed east to poland and jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in lvov ( 1356 ) , sandomierz ( 1367 ) , and kazimierz near krak\u00f3w ( 1386 ) . 
  [ 28 ] casimir , who according to a legend had a jewish lover named esterka from opoczno [ 35 ] was especially friendly to the jews , and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for polish jewry , and was nicknamed by his contemporaries `` king of the serfs and jews . '', 
  under penalty of death , he prohibited the kidnapping of jewish children for the purpose of enforced christian baptism . 
  he inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of jewish cemeteries . 
  nevertheless , while for the greater part of casimir 's reign the jews of poland enjoyed tranquility , toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the black death . 
  in 1348 , the first blood libel accusation against jews in poland was recorded , and in 1367 the first pogrom took place in pozna\u0144 ( posen ) . 
  [ 36 ] compared with the pitiless destruction of their co-religionists in western europe , however , the polish jews did not fare badly ; and the jewish masses of germany fled to the more hospitable cities in poland . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_poland poland and then commonwealth were very friendly towards jews for centuries compared to the rest of the europe and new waves of jewish immigration arrived every few decades whenever a wave of pogroms swept western europe .

  it 's a military cementary for the solder of [ 2nd polish corps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ii_corps_\\ ( poland \\ ) ) that was a part of [ polish armed forces in the west ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_armed_forces_in_the_west ) fought in [ wwii italian campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_campaign_\\ ( world_war_ii \\ ) ) and is fairly known for its actions during the [ battle of monte cassino ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_monte_cassino ) as well as [ employing a bear ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wojtek_\\ ( bear \\ ) ) . 
  the confusion is n't as absurd as it sounds tho . 
  poland had a well assimilated roma community for hundreds of years . 
  since xvii there was an institution of romani kings nominated by the state to safeguard roma rights and protected them from prosecution . 
  that in turn resulted in much better adjusted minority than romanian treatment of them that amounted to slavery , only 150 years ago . 
  during the interwar period there were around 30.000 roma living in poland with majority still nomadic and using wagons , but significant part was settled . 
  those who survived the war continued their lifestyle till 60s and 70s when the state started cracking down on nomadism and by 80s almost all were settled . 
  in those times roma-related themes become very common in pop culture with two of the most iconic songs of the era being about them and romanticizing them : [ [ song 1 ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdzclrzv1jk ) . 
  [ translation ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/dzis-prawdziwych-cyganow-juz-nie-ma-today-there-arent-real-gypsies-anymore.html ) , [ [ song 2 ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdvh6x_cxxu ) . 
  [ translation ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/jada-wozy-kolorowe-colorful-waggons-are-driving.html ) by the 90s roma were almost exclusively associated with those as well as their [ particular architectural tastes ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=cyga%c5%84skie+domy&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_h5u38jntahvjg5okhs9bci0q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=916 ) . 
  and then comes massive romanian crisis of early 90s and laxer border controls in post-soviet block era . 
  thousands of romanian roma arrive to poland setting up shanty towns and begging on the streets . 
  at the same time sides of the polish roads suddenly get full of romanian women - victims of human trafficking forced by circumstance or coerced into prostitution . 
  the phenomena was so widespread and new that within few years a word `` rumunka '' ( * femininum * for romanian ) become synonymous with side-of-the-road prostitute . 
  this phenomena all but disappeared by now as state hot its shit together and mostly dealt with big organized crime by the end of the 90s , but that was basically a baseline for romanian reputation in post-communist poland . 
  things have been slowly improving perception-wise , but it will take time . 
  well , i was asking the question myself , so i do n't know the answer . 
  also doubt that the way to fix the vaguely described `` undemocraticness '' of eu is to take away the power from smaller nations . 
  and surely not without rebuilding the whole system first . 
  and i mean , surely all the countries in the eu have the separation of church and state , at least in principle . 
  a bit weird topic to pick up . 
  as for my personal view on how to reform eu , since you asked , i 'm more or less in the [ diem25 ] ( https://diem25.org/manifesto-long/ ) camp . 
  oh , financial markets would n't like him ? 
  damn , i had no idea !, 
  no sane person would vote for someone disliked by our benevolent overlords . 
  this whole democracy thing is really getting out of hand if such people have a shot at power . 
  so he wants to change the eu to make it more left-wing ? 
  if so , then by all means . 
  `` terrorism '' is a tool , not at ideology or a political movement in itself . 
  pkk is a separatist organization fighting against suppression and discrimination of a minority by a fiercely nationalist state . 
  in the years of the conflict they 've radicalized beyond what we can find acceptable from our comfy sofas , , but they surely are n't a fucking death cult you try to compare them to . 
  and the `` terror '' such organizations are able to produce is nothing compared to what a nation state hellbent on suppressing dissidents can justify and do once it 's gripped by chauvinist fever . 
  and this specific conflict is a `` great '' example of it . 
  [ turkish military killed between 18000 and 20000 kurdish civilians in extrajudicial executions alone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdish%e2%80%93turkish_conflict_\\ ( 1978 % e2 % 80 % 93present \\ ) ) . 
  and that death toll is a decade old now . 
  that does n't even count collateral damage and turkish military routinely bombed towns and villages into ruble in order to deal with potential pkk threats there and teach locals a lesson . 
  these days they apparently are n't doing full scale bombings anymore , but leveling towns with helicopters and artillery bombardment is still commonplace . 
  so yes , i 'm being sympathetic to the people at the receiving end of turkish terror campaign . 
  built in 1811 ( or either 1795 and 1808 according to other sources ) tomb of eastern prussian von fahrenheid family . 
  owner of the estate baron friedrich von fahrenheid was an avid art collector and patron of the arts . 
  he graduated from the university of konigsberg , where he had an opportunity to attend the lectures by immanuel kant himself . 
  during his later travels across europe he visited paris and there got fascinated by then new and fashionable egyptology to the point that he commissioned pyramid-like tomb for himself and his family . 
  the shape was supposed to facilitate the mummification of the bodies . 
  tomb has been ransacked during both world wars and the kept wasting away till it was lately renovated by the local authorities . 
  mummified remains have been put back in order and are still inside , but the tomb is sealed at the moment .

  what a pile of bull . 
  ca n't you edgy libertarian shits just stick to wykop.pl ? 
  is that too much to ask ? 
  care to provide some reports on children being taken away from families due to simply being poor ? 
  my mother used to work in social services specifically controlling families that were assigned such supervision by family courts and i know for a fact that taking children away only takes place in cases of truly severe and continuous negligence or abuse . 
  also you ca n't possibly not know about 500 + discriminating against single parents since that was only the most criticized part of the most talked about piece of legislation of last 12 months . 
  just stop making shit up , will ya ? 
  yeah , he 's making this up as he goes . 
  there are actual tax and welfare benefits to being married , although probably not as big as in many western countries who inherited such systems from few decades prior . 
  singling out lone parents in legislation simply does n't go well in any demographics save truly fanatical catholics and edgy , libertarian shits . 
  also such statistics , by their nature refer only to the younger parts of the society . 
  ideas such as marrying one another due to accidental pregnancy has n't been looked favorably upon for quite a while now . 
  at least outside particularly conservative eastern towns and villages . 
  i simply got annoyed by the sheer volume of nationalistic rhetoric attempting to overly simplify the matter and painting actions of turkish state in flowers and rainbows . 
  i have the similar reaction to erdoganists and kemalists as to their polish versions . 
  and amount of terror an organization such as pkk or other separatist movements can produce is nothing compared to what a nation state hellbent on suppressing dissidents can justify and do once it 's gripped by chauvinist fever . 
  now i 'm confused what you 're referring to in this tangent . 
  i simply pointed that `` brits this '' , `` turks that '' , `` poles say '' , `` french do n't like '' is an extremally common way of phrasing things in english that does n't imply that all of those peoples do that . 
  ergo , a meaningless nitpick and attempt at avoiding referring to the arguments made by the poster but alleging that he is somehow a crazed turk hater . 
  spain is specifically one of the countries that independently list pkk as a criminal organization . 
  if that 's the case when having such guy is indeed problematic for hdp , but not particularly surprising . 
  mixing left-wing politics with movement based around a nationality and its rights can lead to strange bedfellows . 
  on the other hand referencing [ sheikh said rebellion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheikh_said_rebellion ) is hardly a surprise since while on paper it was a bid to restore an ottoman empire the strong kurdish backbone it ended relying on was mostly in it not for the caliphate part , but as an act of defiance against the nationalistic prosecution of the new regime .
