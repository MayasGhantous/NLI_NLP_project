  oh common , do n't take it too seriously . 
  ridiculing the english is waaay to easy these days and you need to spice things up a bit . 
  update : she later described 50km stretch of land between current scottish border and the hadrian 's wall as a `` rightful scottish clay '' and its return to the motherland as `` obviously obvious '' . 
  last year i 've been offered a job in sweden in my field and had i accepted it i would have moved there without knowing a word in swedish . 
  an expectation to learn the language beforehand is ridiculous . 
  oh yeah , we do have some of those ... my grandfather actually fought in international brigades , so this specific kind of stupid particularly annoys me . 
  considering that there were [ 608 cases of murder ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116483/hosb0212.pdf ) total in uk in 2010 i 'd say that you 're full of shit . 
  yeah . 
  and it shows too . 
  let 's just say that if i had a similar material material , but regarding ancient rome that i specialize in and made similar conclusions i 'd be told to chill the fuck out and stick to the fucking sources . 
  and the author of this book seems to be going waaay further . 
  honestly i blame stupidity of the media with articles such as `` jews demand xxx billions of dollars for property lost during the war '' ( there have n't been group reparations for such things and anyone who wants them , no matter the nationality , needs to take the case to court ) . 
  no , `` the jews '' do n't want anything . 
  jews ca n't even agree if state of israel should exist , yet alone on the `` preferred legal way of seeking compensation for the lost of ancestral property during wwii '' . 
  it 's some us foundation with several dozen members you dimwits . 
  and jewish history has indeed become extremely popular in last 20 years or so and the interest is only growing . 
  even 10 years ago when i was studying history jewish history was among most popular specializations . 
  one of the latest fruits of it is a recently opened [ museum of the history of polish jews ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polin_museum_of_the_history_of_polish_jews ) . 
  there are quite a few films on the subject of polish-jewish history or adjacent including a true masterpiece that is [ ida ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ida_\\ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  if you are at all interested in a subject ( or even if you are n't ) you should * really * watch it . 
  one of the best films i 've seen in years . 
  problem is that what gets attention is the stupid shit few halfwits on both sides spout ( having ventured into comments sections of poland-related articles at jewish websides i 've seen some shit ) . 
  it then energizes ignorant majority for a few seconds feeding resentment and pulling us apart as whole societies . 
  fun fact : the bit about jews in poland being traditionally more left leaning , supporting socialists and in the past communists is actually quite true . 
  from late xix to the start of wwii non-orthodox jews and poles of jewish descent usually gravitated towards the left with the rest of political spectrum being either religious ( judaist or catholic ) , agrarian or outright nationalistic ( both polish and jewish ) . 
  that lead to certain over-representation of jews in left wing parties during interbellum after war resulting in similar over-representation of experienced jewish activists rising to prominence within the communist party right after the war . 
  hell even today we have waaaay more jews or people with jewish roots in the socialist party i 'm a part of than their % in society would indicate . 
  as in several orders of magnitude more . 
  support of israel and its policies is , let 's just say `` limited '' in those circles , but that kinda comes with 100 years of history too . 
  i mean , it 's hard to tell , really . 
  i have n't had enough of such discussions to consider it a proper sample and `` do you engage in whataboutism on this topic ? '', 
  is n't exactly a type of question that can be polled . 
  and to be honest that whole article seems like all kinds of bullshit ( not written by a historian , and i have n't heard about it till now so there has n't been any nerve touching or even media coverage ; for starters ) basically fishing for outrage and reactions like that , so there is that . 
  all true , all whataboutism in this case . 
  not for 20 years at least . 
  i ca n't recall a single instance of such sentiment from non-right-wing media . 
  while that 's true it is indeed whataboutism . 
  horrific oppression by german occupation authorities may explain why some people refused to help and hide their jewish neighbors or random jews who escaped from the ghettos and showed up at their doorstep it in no way excuses those despicable creatures who informed about hiding jews or killed them themselves . 
  they are in no way better than a german soldier doing so . 
  probably even worse since germans were following often direct orders while those poles betrayed their country and its laws in a degree punishable by death . 
  there really is no excuse for it . 
  and pretending that such people did n't exist , that somehow poles are incapable of such evil is not only false and outright stupid , but also dangerous . 
  it sends the massage to our children that we 're , as a nation , somehow innately can do no evil breeding toxic , stupefying nationalist sentiments . 
  also the sole number of victims among jewish and non-jewish poles is a stupid way of comparing the atrocities suffered ( if you * really * need to for some bizarre reason ) . 
  both were horrific and beyond what rest of europe , maybe except soviet union endured , but one suffered by jews was several magnitudes worse . 
  out of 100 non-jewish poles around 15 did n't survive the war . 
  that number for jewish poles is close to 90 . 
  the author of the book . 
  sociologist that apparently graduated from my university and that i 've never heard of before . 
   ad 1 . no , in fact you can live 30 years in poland and hear no such story ( except for jedwabne , which is widely criticized as `` a fraud '' ) . 
  public opinion is protected from knowledge of poles killing jews to the point that most poles believe it almost never happened ( and if it happened it was ok because `` jews were communists after the war '' , i kid you not , that 's the logic ) . 
  i think you are exaggerating here . 
  the `` wide '' criticism was almost exclusively from the fringe of the right-wing and since the jedwabne debate everyone but the fringe of said fringe pretty much acknowledged that it happened . 
  i mean it 's not a very popular subject in the media , i do n't think , but 2 years ago when [ ida ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ida_\\ ( film \\ ) ) that deals with those issues was wildly popular there was hardly any pushback from the right either . 
  remember it very well - i was pleasantly surprised how much of a non-issue it was . 
  i mean , sure - recognizing past crimes and preventing the rose-colored glasses type of history from spreading are important things , but having delved into the subject as written about by gross i have strong suspicions that the book in question while going waaaaaay further than gross with it is is of dubious quality . 
  by a sociologist-playing-historian too . 
  and i think that falsifying history the other way , to make it look more grim , is almost as despicable . 
  not only from my professional standpoint as a historian , but also by giving deniers an easy target to point at when their own falsifications are being challenged . 
  and if the goal of it is to fight right-wing delusions it is outright counterproductive . 
  tho i think that the only goal of the author here is to put oneself in a spotlight . 
  i would n't say that there is a revisionist history going on in poland , at least not when it comes to that subject . 
  books about the subjects have been written 20 years ago or so , there has been a discussion and beyond the most retarded right-wing fringe there is an acceptance of a fact that there have been instances of poles murdering their neighbors of jewish descent . 
  hell , 2 years ago , we won a bloody oscar with [ a movie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ida_ ( film \\ ) ) about that very thing . 
  and while there is a disgusting historical right-wing push by the current government they are yet to touch that specific subject . 
  it 's quite unlikely they ever will since both kaczy\u0144ski ( ober-president ) and duda ( president ) , even being the waste of air they are , not only never expressed any antisemitic sentiments but were very vocal in condemning antisemitism . 
  [ duda 's wife , current first lady ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agata_kornhauser-duda ) is of jewish descent too . 
  the thing is that the book in question seems to be a less-than-stellar academic work , by a sociologist playing historian , as i explained in more detail in comments above . 
  it seems that de jure death penalty was specifically only for the family that aided the jews , not the whole village , but killings of whole villages by [ einsatzgruppen ] ( https://www.google.pl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewic5tuc3nrsahwjkcwkhq1zbpmqfggcmaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2feinsatzgruppen&amp;usg=afqjcnec55_vpwokig5bjtl135r8g1qyuw&amp;sig2=9qcserlpqy6lwpds4uhjag ) for the offense were a commonplace as well : sources : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rescue_of_jews_by_poles_during_the_holocaust#punishment_for_aiding_the_jews, 
  i ca n't find a bigger bit atm , but she does indeed say that and it does n't seem out of context . 
  that 's a pretty fucking stupid thing to say . 
  also because very significant percentage of polish jews were non-religious or at least non-orthodox . 
  i have n't read the book , so i ca n't honestly judge the quality of the work , but those kinda of statements make me question of the author 's goal was to get to the bottom of things , or simply get into the spotlight . 
  there has been similar books by jan gross in last 20 years and having read them ( even taken full semester of classes devoted to them ) i can say that they 're a solid work as far as sources go . 
  problem with them was that the conclusions drawn from the facts have often been very cavalier ; aimed at stirring the debate . 
  i 'd still say they were on the edge of bounds of reason , but still more or less within them and the debate was needed , so oh well . 
  and they still were nowhere near the conclusions reported in the article . 
  here it seems like the author may be aiming at one-upping mr. 
  gross rather than producing a sound scientific text . 
  edit : turns out she 's a sociologist and a psychologist , not an actual historian . 
  it would explain potential issues with the source criticism and overall historian 's craft . 
  were n't pvda left-in-name-only , anyways ? 
  classic case of ~ ~ stockholm ~ ~ belfast syndrome . 
  and ireland is the one kept in a basement dungeon . 
  but i was told that only way labour can win in the elections is to be basically tory , but slightly less posh . 
  area between hadrian 's wall and current scottish border is clearly a rightful scottish clay for almost 2000 years now . 
  got ta gib it back !, 
  it 's a warranty thing . 
  you build it , now it 's a pile of rabble so it stands to reason that you should pay for the shitty job you 've done . 
  kurdish one is very much a modern leftist party akin to podemos and similar new left movements . 
  could you post the source , or at least numbers for poland as well ? 
  sadly that graphic is [ severely outdated ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2016/turkey ) thus presenting level of freedom and overall quality of governance in turkey in very distorted way . 
  the difference between score showed here and the actual score is close to 50 % , so i 'd argue that the submission is ** misleading ** . 
  ** up to date report can be found here : ** https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2017/turkey, 
  even if we agree that there was equivalency of how awful campaigns were , only one of those was actively shitting on other europeans and eu as a whole . 
  not sure why some find it weird that leave campaign is very much looked down upon in the rest of eu . 
  and that 's even without getting into all the xenophobic abuse aimed at romanians and to lesser extent poles . 
  or completely coincidental rise in actual physical attacks against eu nationals . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v117ycxb6a0 ) is * so * much better . 
  watch with video .
