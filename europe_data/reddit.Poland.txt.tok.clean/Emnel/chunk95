  at least one useful anti-virus software from the region . 
  avast is bloody atrocious . 
  nah , that definitely would n't fly beyond most extremist of the extremes . 
  maybe few hundred people in total in the whole country . 
  more likely than not it would get your ass shipped back to states or at least grant you a lengthy discussion with authorities about your sense of humor and a place of few lists . 
  we may have a lot of catholics , but our attitude towards faith and religion is * much * more lukewarm than in tends to be in the us . 
  much closer to eu standards . 
  of course . 
  and here we are . 
  we shall see if eu involvement will end this farce . 
  thanks to , in no small way , also this issue % of poles saying that they have favorable opinion about americans fell by over 40 % . 
  over 60 % when asked about the usa as a country . 
  number of those who hold an unfavorable view quintupled and tripled respectively . 
  us government sure done its best to stop poland from being its trojan horse in eu . 
  nope . 
  `` krzy\u017cacy '' refers specifically to [ teutonic order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teutonic_order ) while albeit similar , but distinct `` krzy\u017cowcy '' is a word for crusaders . 
  yes . 
  even in the clusterfuck that us politics is an instance in which trump and republicans want to comply with eu demands , but democrats block them seems very unlikely . 
  q 6 : what is your stance on invading other countries in violation of un resolutions ? 
  q 7 : are you a proponent of torture ? 
  q 8 : do you think that non-us citizens ought to have human rights ? 
  ofc he can . 
  the main characteristic of any law is a fact that it can be changed if lawmakers wish it . 
  and in international relations between eu and us internal us regulations should be of little concern . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the anti-brexit sentiment is in no small part fueled by both the lies and vileness of leave campaign as well as the current treatment of eu nationals living in the uk . 
  i do n't see how being sympathetic to [ wronged scots ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) makes one hypocritical . 
  satire , mostly . 
  shit , turns out russians were right all along !, 
  accurate representation of eu as seen by kaczy\u0144ski and polish right-wing media after yesterday 's vote for eu president . 
  in case it 's not self-explanatory : * ** niemcy ** - germans * ** homo-niemcy ** - less than heteronormative germans * ** zimowi niemcy ** - winter germans * ** a jednak niemcy !, 
  ** - germans , afterall !, 
  ** - look , how many germans here !, 
  * ** krzy\u017cacy ** - teutons * ** tu te\u017c niemcy ** - germans here as well . 
  ** - papa also german ? 
  * ** nawet to niemcy ** - even here germans * ** niemcy ba\u0142ka\u0144scy ** - balkan germans, 
  [ thanks \u00d6bama !,

  does it leave an empty subreddit ? 
  andrzej , is that you ? 
  oh , i 100 % agree that some groups are * much * more prone to such attacks . 
  in fact i always bet on the identity of an attacker and am yet to be wrong . 
  i 'm going for gender , rather than ethnicity tho . 
   itt : people speculating about the motives and the ethnicity of the man were all wrong . 
  shocking !, 
  if only everyone was so mellow ... 
  they 're actually saying , and i shit you not , that today 's vote and the fact that polish government 's view was n't accepted is an example of how undemocratic ( sic ! ), 
  and dysfunctional eu has become . 
  they even compared it to the treatment of greece during its negotiations with troika . 
  that must be the 1st instance of pis and its media actually noticing the fact that greeks got shafted instead of claiming that they 're lazy and that it 's their own fault . 
  you thought that our government ca n't get any fucking dumber , did n't you ? 
  you figured they are as stupid as it gets and that the show is over , huh ? 
  ** poland : pushing boundaries of possibility **, 
  how dare you !, 
  they merely fight against one another , we manage on our very own !, 
  oh , the famous efficiency of pis diplomacy on full display . 
  29 months to go . 
  while i would n't vote for tusk or po unless my very life depended on it , your comment is utter bullshit , expressing views of only the most hardcore pis voters . 
  not really , but considering that portugal has n't been leveled , occupied of 6 years or had almost 20 % of its population killed in wwii , has n't had its borders redrawn or survivors forcibly relocated i 'd say that post-war communist government has done a quite a good job rebuilding the country , considering . 
  sure , had poland been ruled by pps and psl stemming from polish underground state and has n't had soviet union controlling it it would have been much better off on all counts , but let 's keep it real and give credit where credit is due . 
  and prl has actually done a very good job of both rebuilding a country and increasing the quality of living when we consider the starting point . 
  saying that it was a 3rd world country is defying logic . 
  and it 's not like polish communist government has n't had enough faults that we need to come up with fictional ones . 
  that 's a very late xix , early xx century state of historical analysis . 
  while bits and pieces of this mechanism still retained in today 's understanding of things it is considered a fairly small piece in a much more complicated labyrinth of causes and effects . 
  for example the development of more advanced economy started quite promptly in early xvii century with many very and moderately rich nobles investing in big manufactory operations , but it was halted and reverted by decades of devastating wars starting in the 2nd part of that century resulting in a loss of over a quarter of the population in the richest core provinces of the country and even more in the rest of the country . 
  country was left in shambles for the better part of xviii century while its neighbors consolidated and evolved . 
  nothing to worry about then . 
  an assumption that the current economic system will continue in the same of similar way for another 150 is very unlikely at best . 
  and studies show that quality of life does n't really improve along with wealth increase once you have a safe place to live and $ 20000 yearly income . 
  considering that 's a value for us it 's probably significantly lower for eu due to better state institutions . 
  say 15000 $ ( 1250 $ / month ) . 
  assuming some wise governance most if not all of ee could reach life quality comparable to the west in 2-3 decades , no problem with middle class of today almost there already . 
  everything beyond that it 's just pointlessly keeping score . 
  and huge parts of the score you see on the map is held by excessively rich anyway . 
  not really as far as middle ages . 
  if you were to put it simply you ought to just boil it down to not profiteering from colonization and few unlucky centuries of devastating wars and lack of continuous , independent statehood . 
  but yes , blaming communism for it all is beyond silly considering in how awful of a place to live an interbellum poland was even without an apocalyptic war to boot . 
  thing is it really was n't . 
  memory of never-ending finantial crisis of the 80s and resulting derelict-ness of infrastructure makes it look bad from today 's perspective but it was still decades ahead of third world . 
  what do you mean ? 
  as if democratic socialist policies of today had anything to do with what was going on in the old soviet bloc . 
  neither as all of them are but a myth . 
  all halva is a mixture of nasal mucus and dandruff . 
  while i could n't care less about visa restrictions to the us ( they do n't want me visiting and spending money there , it 's their problem and they can fuck right of ) internal us rules should be of little consequence in international relations . 
  it 's about time eu started fighting for its citizens ' rights be it on this issue or regarding internet market . 
  fascinating information . 
  tell us more !, 
  out of curiosity - which of those commie rags is the worst offender ? 
  - economist - wall street journal - financial times and what media would you suggest for someone who 'd like to avoid communist propaganda ? 
  not if the clouds are n't covering the whole sky . 
  quite a common occurrence , really . 
  try being us ... 
  while i enjoy balkan nationalist shouting matches as much as the next guy could you first elaborate on `` unofficially marking the beginning of the bosnian civil war '' bit ? 
  most sources seem to consider 6th of april as the starting date of bosnian ( civil ? ), 
  war . 
  considering that there has n't been actual fighting between 1st of march and late march are n't event 's such as [ sijekovac massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sijekovac_killings ) ( killings of serbs by bosnian and croat armies ) or [ bijeljina massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bijeljina_massacre ) ( killing of bosniaks by serb units ) more suitable for `` an unofficial beginning of the war '' if one really wants to have such thing for w/e reason ? 
  is there any more substance to it than a desire to piss on bosnian independence day ? 
  do n't know enough about corbyn and his latest actions to have good enough opinion , but i have a feeling that good advice given to the left by financial times is about as valuable as a similar piece in guardian about ukip . 
  yeah , that 's a pretty standard slavic grammar . 
  now you 're just being petty .
