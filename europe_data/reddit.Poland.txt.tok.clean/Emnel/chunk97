  you realize those are people who need to eat , drink and have roof over their heads , right ? 
  it 's pretty hard to achieve those levels of luxury on grant trash contracts and 2000 pln stipends . 
  they do n't have to be as high as they are in the west . 
  but they need to be at least living wages . 
  i 'll try , but i honestly have no idea how to translate the legal terms used to describe those things in polish . 
  so called `` trash contracts '' has become a plague throughout the last decade or so . 
  by law if a person performs his/her job in a designated place , in designated hours and under supervision they should be hired using a standard contract - paid leave , health insurance , sick leave pension fund , minimal wage , limited maximum working hours , regulated and paid overtime , notice time etc. 
  what has become a commonplace in many areas including science is use of contracts that were designed for temporary jobs ( agriculture workers during summer ) or one time deals ( like painting a building ) to circumvent those safety nets and make the employment both significantly cheaper and non-binding for an employer . 
  people get two contracts - one for a fixed amount per month , a small sum like 100 pln ( 25 $ ) that is a base for their health insurance and pension fund ( mandatory and paid by the employer ) and including some notice time and a 2nd one , linked to the first that actually stipulates their hourly wage . 
  thing is that the second contract does n't include any of the safeguards i mentioned few paragraphs earlier . 
  no paid or sick leave , no pension fund transfer , no overtime or minimal hours/week regulations and up until january 1st of this year not even a minimal hourly wage . 
  basically no legal standing , no job security , no contributions to pension fund for the future . 
  and if you happen to have an accident or get sick so you ca n't work for a few weeks ? 
  you 'll still get the access to healthcare ( that other taxpayers will have to pay for since your employer only paid it as if you worked for 25 $ / month ) , but good luck paying your rent or buying food . 
  even if you are healthy you can still find yourself without work at moment 's notice since those are basically zero-hour contracts , so if your employer figures that they can make due with one less person since tomorrow or that he/she simply does n't like you you 're basically out of the job on the spot . 
  i 've heard horror stories about terms offered young scientists . 
  they 'd shock a supermarket cashier . 
  so those who ca n't find reasonable employment are either moving to civilized countries ( if they can , base on their family/material situation ) or either get that cashier job while finishing their phd or give up on that altogether . 
   american destroyers weigh more and pack more into their hull than european ships , which are nearly half the tonnage . 
  for example , the us navy outweighs the next 10 largest navies combined . 
  americans sure do n't know when to stop . 
  based on what my scientist friends are telling me things are indeed getting better lately when it comes to funding , which should combat brain drain but for post grads the situation is spotty at best . 
  in many fields grant receivers still try to save money on employment costs and by using bad hiring practices are pushing young scientists abroad . 
  and especially german institutes are hiring them by the dozen . 
  well , that 's one side of this coin . 
  another is german banks investing in toxic and therefore extremely profitable greek debt papers cashing their profits and nationalizing the losses while pointing finger at those bad , bad greeks . 
  it 's written in euro english , so the proper one . 
  i mean , technically they are also replaced in proper polish , but when it comes to very * recent * loan words they are sometimes used in their original form . 
  we rarely polonize people 's names , however - that 's almost exclusively limited to ones that existed in language for decades . 
  that 's the point . 
   polonismusms ftfy, 
  you speak truth my very russian and absolutely real comrade and/or friend . 
  let us go and drink a customary russian amount of delicious russian vodka toasting the downfall of european union while discussing the superiority of russian vodka over that awful polish one . 
  real russians like you and me know those things very well . 
  let me finish this absolutely russian conversation with traditional russian salute written in real russian language : zdrastvujtie tavarish sabaka kalin kakalin kakalin kamaya cyka bliat . 
  putin 4ever . 
  death to everyone but russians and especially to all the innocent babies . 
  particularly those european ones . 
  i was n't being literal , but :   6700 rapes per year in sweden ... https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/news-from-bra/archive/news/2011-01-18-how-common-is-rape-in-sweden-compared-to-other-european-countries.html  ( ... ) , in sweden a lot of effort is made to register all cases that can be suspected to be rape . 
  as this is done at a very early stage of the process , cases are included that later turn out to be some other sex crime , or even no crime at all . 
  in addition to this , all individual acts are registered -- not just the latest occasion or the main crime . 
  no , there were n't  6700 rapes in sweden . 
  seen that [ uber ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5v1hjc/former_engineer_says_uber_is_a_nightmare_of_sexism/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) thread today ? 
  under swedish law uber offices alone would surpass sweden as a whole . 
  is n't that related to the older balkan immigration from the 90s that is known to have monopolized swedish organized crime `` market '' ? 
  there are some differences , but very few of them and to a fairly small degree are actually definded by the size . 
  for example paying 100 $ for internet in bumfuckville , arizona makes some sense , but in one of the big cities ? 
  no , not really . 
  the real reason is that absurdly corrupt connection between business and politics that us has resulting in government regulations protecting corporations rather than consumers . 
  i mean , i pay 17 $ / month for 250mbit connection , and while costs for us providers may be 50 or even 100 % higher it sure as hell does n't explain the actual price disparity . 
   liberals love looking at sweden 's welfare state while ignoring the free market reforms that allow them to afford all of it . 
  it was *** literally *** the other way around . 
  read up on the history of nordic model and you 'll see that the welfare state has been introduced when those countries were dirt poor and their current wealth is a product of decades of fighting poverty . 
  liberalization of market and labor laws is something that was introduced throughout last 20 years or so . 
  you realize those numbers are per capita , right ? 
  and if you 'd compare us and eu as a whole things would be about the same so quit that `` oh but we are soooooo big , that 's totally different '' bs . 
  are we talking about the us ? 
  i 'd say that they have way more than just a single crippling problem that keeps getting worse . 
  reported unemployment is much higher in all of eu due to both different definitions as well as actual unemployment benefits . 
  in us it is done by a survey asking 2 questions : `` are you employed ? '', 
  and `` are you currently looking for a job ? '' . 
  you are listed as `` unemployed '' only if you are both without a job and looking for it . 
  if you are n't looking you are n't considered in the statistics at all . 
  also in most of the eu there are actual benefits you can get as an unemployed person so it makes sense to register as one , and due to other safety nets ( like access to healthcare ) you are not forced to get a job asap or outright die . 
  when it comes to prices at least in poland you are definitely paying less for hot water/heat from the city than you would heating your water/house with gas . 
  ( actual hot tap water comes with no additional charge ) . 
  especially for bigger apartments its up to few times cheaper . 
  it 's also much more reliable and there is no cost of maintenance and replacement for your heater . 
  that hot water is sort off a byproduct of energy production in fossil fuel power stations or smaller dedicated power-heating stations . 
  ( that happen not to have even an english wiki page , so here is the [ german ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/heizkraftwerk ) , [ russian ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a2%d0%b5%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%8d%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be%d1%86%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c ) and [ polish ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/elektrociep%c5%82ownia ) one for google translate use . ), 
  some places still do n't have the hot water connected and use ( almost exclusively [ tankless ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tankless_water_heating ) ) water heaters for both hot water and heating , but that becomes quite rare . 
  i 've been apartment hunting for the last year and those few places that still used water heaters had them scheduled for replacement within few years . 
   she was not deliberately taking performance enhancing drugs , but she used a cream to treat some lip-sores that contained steroids on the doping list . 
  norwegian ski teams are notorious for pulling shit like being `` asthmatic '' and other disingenuous performance enhancement methods , so i 'm pretty sure that 's pretty damn close to business as usual . 
  that 's a drink , not a snack you silly . 
  50x1-hum classification is for parts that could reveal the identity of a human source . 
  right , because we 're somehow obliged to waste our time debating with people spreading [ this drivel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba8gsrnjhfw ) of strawman arguments , pseudoscience and xix century racism . 
  they can fuck right back to whatever cave they crawled out of and cry about being oppressed all they want . 
  that shit would n't fly even in poland . 
  even today . 
  and by far . 
  [ why wait ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/5p3tjn/til_that_czechia_used_to_be_called_czech_republic/ ), 
  never heard about this cource of the meaning of `` bohemian '' before . 
  i do n't think it 's known wide enough to breed stereotypes . 
  99 % of people will just associate it with `` artsy '' . 
  source ? 
  7 years away if things go well . 
  3 in very optimistic scenario . 
  studying history has little to do with learning about facts and a lot with learning how to think , interpret the sources , trying to understand the circumstances and understanding limits of one 's knowledge . 
  you seem to spectacularly fail at all counts . 
  care to share what illustrious institution are you attending ? 
  and what year are you on ? 
  i sure hope its the 1st one . 
  like not being serfs , not being shot on the streets , not being starved to death or not working in factory conditions that make one a 30yo cripple ? 
  does n't really matter tho . 
  the point op makes stands - in poland people used to learn russian in school , but they never really got to use it and very few actually can despite russian being closer linguistically to polish . 
  at the same time you use english every day and your knowledge of it keep rising while that of other foreign languages usually diminishes . 
  and since russian is such a big market i know ukrainians who barely spoke polish or english being hired for their ability to speak russian . 
  in place my brother works ( local branch of a big international bank ) they 've hired a lithuanian girl he knows for her russian , but they could n't even test it beforehand since at the time not a single person working there knew it .
