  out of 3000 people . 
  been there , done that . 
  i heard so many smokescreen theories recently that you can make full circles out of them . 
  a covers b , b covers c , c -  d , d -  a etc. 
  so i may be indeed a bit overzealous in spotting those as a result . 
  that religious thinking again . 
  everything has to be a smokescreen for something . 
  idea that `` there must be a bigger plan , a force controlling everything '' seems so much easier to swallow for so many people than a simple fact that the world is a fucking shitshow where well over 95 % of things happen more or less randomly or simply independently from one another . 
  for those who are smart enough to not buy into this blatant imperialist propaganda by the us claiming that san escobar `` does n't exist '' here are some sources to learn about this small but proud nation : official [ facebook account ] ( https://www.fb.com/sanescobarcountry/ ) of san escobar official [ tweeter account ] ( https://twitter.com/rpdsanescobar ) of san escobar official [ twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/mfasanescobar ) of ministry of foreign affairs of san escobar . 
  official [ twitter account of san escobar 's mission to the un ] ( https://twitter.com/sanescobarun ) official [ twitter account of partido popular socialista ] ( https://twitter.com/pps_sanescobar ) - a ruling party in san escobar facebook page of leading local newspaper - [ san escobar times ] ( https://www.fb.com/sanescobartimes ) and , sadly , a facebook page of viscous communist guerilla that plagues this peaceful and prosperous nation - [ el frente comunista de san escobar ] ( https://www.fb.com/frentecomunista/ ), 
  waszczykowski is n't even halfway to being smart enough for that . 
  also , it you check the accounts followed by san escobar 's twitter it 's easy to figure out who is doing the trolling . 
  while i understand the argument and where it comes from as well as to some extend people who are making it i do think it is very poorly thought out one . 
  let 's start with the use of `` stealing electorate '' phrase . 
  i do n't really think that you can * steal * voters in a democracy unless you are grossly disingenuous pretending that you 're someone you are not . 
  i do n't that is even remotely true in our case and am yet to hear someone genuinely claim it . 
  all we did was find ourselves without a party to vote for for so long that we finally created our own ( well over 90 % of our members have literally no experience in politics and the rest took part is some small left wing movements ) , came up with a program and presented it to people asking them to vote for us and they voted . 
  there is no `` electorate '' to `` win `` or `` steal '' , there are just people making their sovereign decisions . 
  and what alternative actions by us would you deem acceptable ? 
  not ever starting a party ? 
  not running in those elections ? 
  why no one ever gives sld similar grief for running in the elections ? 
  or for not dissolving itself ? 
  or , i do n't know , for not being a left-wing party for well over a decade ? 
  how about people stop actually beating foreigners ? 
  i know that 's a novel idea , but perhaps calling the police if you 're being actively harassed would work ? 
  i heard some people practice that over attacking others physically . 
  considering that you are determined enough to pull things such as our member not liking being called `` damsel '' i absolutely not believe that you `` barely held yourself '' there for 30 minutes and yet failed to take a photo to back up your razem = stalinists claim . 
  how stupid do you think people are ? 
  did you really think that this story is passable ? 
  it is known that a politician and a political party can only ever work on one issue at the time . 
  this is one of the things we 've been talking about internally , but i do n't think it has made its way to our actual economical program just yet . 
  thing is that with how reform-happy our current government is it is really hard to tell how the country and its tax law will look by the next election , so we are n't really focusing on making a comprehensive economical reform agenda asap and therefore nothing has been internally decided yet . 
   well i 've seen how immediate that reaction was . 
  stood there for like half an hour and they waved these flags happily . 
  oh , and you clearly forgot your phone or figured that is n't something you 'd like to document . 
  along with every other person that passed there for half an hour . 
  sure , sounds legit . 
   been on one of their marches , they walk shoulder to shoulder with people carrying ussr flags . 
  that 's obviously an utter bullshit . 
  the few times people like that show up they 've been immediately told to pull that shit down or leave . 
   they also believe in generational debts , which is very reminiscent of the nsdap . 
  recently on their official facebook profile they posted a picture saying that `` the descendants of peasants have never been paid back for their ancestors ' work '' that 's actually us making a point about the government giving money and land to the descendants of aristocracy . 
  i 'm glad that you agree that such things should n't happen . 
  would n't go as far as to call it reminiscent of nsdap , but i guess you 're more on the left wing than i am . 
   to end in a funnier way , here 's how they reacted when a guy referred to one of their members as `` wa\u0107panna '' which roughly translates to `` lady '' more like a `` damsel '' . 
  `` lady '' refers to a married woman , `` panna '' means `` miss '' - not really used anymore term for an unmarried and/or young woman and `` wa\u0107panna '' is an even more archaic version of it that was used by nobility . 
  `` damsel '' is definitely the closest english word to it . 
  i 'd love to see an english female politician referred to as `` damsel '' by her political opponent and everyone finding it normal . 
  exactly !, 
  high taxation is , after all , the reason why all the companies from such highly taxed places as france , germany , uk , denmark , sweden , norway all moved to romania the moment it joined the eu . 
  it was even more devastating than when poland joined and all of german firms just packed up , crossed the oder river and set up their shops in poland the moment it joined the eu . 
  i do n't understand how people can fail to grasp such obvious and empirically proven economical concept !, 
  what idiots !, 
  but in all seriousness i ca n't think of any other field than economics where you can keep spouting such baseless , empirically debunked brainspawns for years and decades and still be listened to and considered a fucking expert . 
  according to such commie rags as [ harvard business review ] ( https://hbr.org/2016/02/stop-paying-executives-for-performance ) , [ oxford journal ] ( http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/2/451.short ) , [ bloomberg businessweek ] ( https://imgur.com/t7jpwnq ) and dozens other studies over last few years highly paid executives have no impact on company performance . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's enough to handle it as well assuming you also have 4th grade reading skills to boot and are able to read the rules governing such perks . 
  you probably add the % of the value to your tax base . 
  it really is n't a fucking rocket science and i 'm at a loss why it is socially acceptable for an adult to claim they ca n't do simple math . 
  probably a bastard spawn of that whole `` economics is too hard to comprehend , better leave it to the experts '' bs people have been fed for last 30 years . 
  yeah i agree and i kinda meant it to be my point by for some reason i went with `` steadily '' rather than `` slowly '' in my post . 
  good catch . 
  in my other post i actually go into extreme detail on how lack of recognition and media interest/coverage are major challenges . 
  i 'm yet to encounter a tax that requires more than an elementary school level mathematics to comprehend . 
  most of what people claim to find impossible to grasp is just progressive taxation . 
  here is how it works : let 's say there are 6 tax brackets : * 0 % for up to 100 $ per year * 20 % for up to 300 $ per year * 30 % for up to 500 $ per year * 40 % for up to 800 $ per year * 50 % for up to 1200 $ per year * 94 % for everything over 1200 $ per year let 's say you earn 1234 $ / year . 
  income tax threshold ( 0 % tax rate ) is at 100 $ -  you pay 0 $ from your 1st 100 $ leaving you with 1134 $ to be taxed further . 
  20 % tax is up to 300 $ --  you pay 20 % out of the 200 $ in this tax bracket ( 300 $ -100 $ ) which amounts to ** 40 $ ** and leave you with 934 $ to be taxed further . 
  30 % tax is up to 500 $ --  you pay 30 % out of the 200 $ in this tax bracket ( 500 $ -300 $ ) which amounts to ** 60 $ ** and leave you with 734 $ to be taxed further . 
  40 % tax is up to 800 $ --  you pay 40 % out of the 300 $ in this tax bracket ( 800 $ -500 $ ) which amounts to ** 120 $ ** and leave you with 434 $ to be taxed further . 
  50 % tax is up to 1200 $ --  you pay 50 % out of the 400 $ in this tax bracket ( 1200 $ -800 $ ) , which amounts to ** 200 $ ** and leave you with 34 $ to be taxed further . 
  94 % tax is applied to anything above 1200 $ --  you pay 94 % out of 34 $ that you have left untaxed amounting to ** 31,96 $ ** your total tax amounts to ** 451,96 $ ** ( 0 +40 +60 +120 +200 +31,96 ) out of your 1234 $ . 
  that also means that your real tax rate was 36,63 % . 
  if you earned : * 200 $ your real tax rate would be 10,00 % * 300 $ your real tax rate would be 13,33 % * 400 $ your real tax rate would be 16,00 % * 500 $ your real tax rate would be 20,00 % * 600 $ your real tax rate would be 23,33 % * 700 $ your real tax rate would be 25,71 % * 800 $ your real tax rate would be 27,50 % * 1000 $ your real tax rate would be 32,00 % * 1200 $ your real tax rate would be 35,00 % * 1500 $ your real tax rate would be 46,80 % that 's the gist of it . 
  in some cases you have other government dues that are either subtracted from your tax base ( 1234 $ in our example ) or tax owed ( 451,96 $ ) . 
  for example in poland the amount payed for your retirement fund ( among other things ) is subtracted from your tax base while the amount payed for your health insurance is subtracted from your taxed owed . 
  in that case both are really just disguised taxes that should have been merged into a basic one , but that 's whole another story . 
  either way you just need to know how to add , subtract , multiplicate and have basic knowledge about fractions to learn anything you need to learn about your taxes . 
  i just checked and that 's knowledge expected of a 4th grader , so a 9yo . 
  i 'm pretty sure that over 99 % of adults are fully able to comprehend it . 
  the purpose of those high , `` punitive '' tax brackets is not a fiscal one ( directly getting tax revenue ) . 
  but a regulatory one . 
  they exist to compel companies to spend less of their pay budget on their executives ( since their pay is heavily taxed ) and more on the low and mid level employees ( that are much less taxed ) . 
  that in turn helps the real economy by driving the demand and in turn tax revenue rather than bloating the financial markets , real estate prices etc. 
  ( since lower payed employees actually spend most of their money , unlike absurdly rich execs ) . 
  not sure if you need 100 % tax for that ( you could stick to 70-90 % as it was in the us in up to the 80s ) , but the whole idea of regulatory tax rate is in my opinion a very solid one and outright needed in today 's economy . 
  it 's like bloody reprivatization all over again . 
  we on the left have been reporting on it for fucking years pointing at cases , citing studies and the rest of the country suddenly learns bout it when wyborcza forced by circumstance graciously decides to bump it from page 15 to 1 and everyone goes `` oh noes !, 
  how could that happen !, 
  why no one seen it coming ? '', 
  followed by `` it 's clearly bullshit , it 's just wyborcza pushing leftist agenda and `` promoting '' leftist organizations !, 
  as always ! '', 
  well , we do have over 3500 members already so as in every organization of this size there are `` wings '' and a certain spectrum of opinions and views . 
  i know one more very combative feminist , but she is both doing everyday work with abused women and has a terrible habit of not ignoring actual online misogynist scum which makes her a bit on edge when it comes to people 's opinions and intentions in feminism-related discussions . 
  i 'd be lying if i said she does n't annoy me at times , but i both very barely bump into her and kinda assume that f i were in her shoes i 'd be bordering on internet-induced ptsd . 
  i sure as hell appreciate the work she 's doing . 
  interesting fact when we 're talking about the feminism and such . 
  we have strict 50/50 gender quotas for most party organs and in the last year 's elections to party 's executive board and council it was [ man replacing women with more votes to match the quota ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/1,75398,20079358,w-razem-parytet-broni-mezczyzn.html ) . 
  one of the people who lost their seats this way was our most prominent feminist author who was a member of previous executive board . 
  obviously not a word complain was uttered and it was hailed as quite a success considering how rare women are elsewhere in polish politics , contrary to what your run of a mill internet troll would make you expect .
