if the biggest and richest economic body in the world is unable to stop a bunch of unarmed migrants what would happen if other country decides to attack us ? 
  i mean , are you nuts ? 
  honestly , i 'm speechless now . 
  no offense , but are you like 12 years old ? 
  how ? 
  i 'd say it 's better than most of the competitors in poland . 
  they 're already finishing them off in many ways , after all , even brits paid for it : http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/lidl-1bn-public-development-funding-supermarket-world-bank-eastern-europe so in short it 's not about supermarkets at all , but about german supremacy in general . 
  this makes me cringe for three reasons : - first of all , even if poles would be `` the thieves and robbers '' of germany then i have absolutely no idea what we 'd have to steal to make us even , after all germans stole everything from us not so long time ago , - most poles i know are stupid and by stupid i mean they work harder than germans for less , same goes for the uk and other countries , i 'd say most of them are the perfect immigrants economy-wise , - looks like there are more german thieves in poland than polish in germany , german & polish police releases stats for brandenburg and west pomeranian voivodeship annually and looks like in 2013 germans commited 5591 crimes , while poles 1231 in brandenburg alone , but it 's 13 % of the crimes commited there , 62 % were commited by germans and around 15 % by russians . 
  i know maybe it looks like poles are the thieves because every time someone steals a car they run quickly to poland ( and then usually to russia / ukraine , generally as far as possible from the eu ) , but this is not the case . 
  i totally get your point , it 's not much better in poland , the point is , your approach is harmful to your own country and i 've seen this happening in my own country . 
  let me just try to translate old polish `` joke '' ( in fact it 's not funny at all and what 's even worse it 's still relevant after 15 years or so ) :  i wake up in the morning , turn my japanese radio on , then i put on my american pants , vietnamese t-shirt and chinese shoes . 
  after that i take german beer from my dutch fridge . 
   i sit in front of my korean computer , i pay for shopping in british online shop through my american bank . 
   after getting spanish fruits , belgian cheese and greek wine i go back home , sit on my italian couch and i look for a job in a polish newspaper . 
   still nothing , i 'm wondering why the heck there are no jobs in poland ?!, 
  note : there 's almost no polish press anymore , over 90 % of our media belong to germany now ( i 'm looking at you axel springer , verlagsgruppe passau and the rest ) . 
  i 'm not saying i have anything against germans per se ( even though my family members were killed in contraction camps ) but i do think we , polish , really lack some common sense and are most likely corrupted by corporations from bigger , much wealthier countries ( example : http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-german-corporate-giants-suspected-in-greek-corruption-cases-2015-8 - you can also google `` siemens auschwitz '' if you want to get a bigger picture ) . 
  tl ; dr please romania , do n't do what we have done if you still have some economy running . 
  we 've sold everything we could ( even tried to sell national forrests recently , yup ) and i can confirm - roads are n't helping us much now . 
  also , we also make 300 euros a month in many places , do n't believe the propaganda . 
  let just germans finish off tesco and we 'll see if they will be willing to pay that much after that , 
  this way romania will always remain poor and that 's why you 're getting so much cash in the first place ( every eu country contributes and gives it to you so you can buy german or british or french shit ) . 
  take a look at my other post . 
  sad to say , but this is total bullshit , i do n't have much time right now to prove it but i will show you a few examples . 
  as a pole , after over a decade in the eu , i can confirm investing in infrastructure is a lie , it 's hard pill to swallow for some , but the wealth countries have good infrastructure not countries ale wealth because they have good infrastructure . 
  countries like ireland got really rich because they were investing european funds in people and made some very good decisions ( tax cuts and stuff ) while recently developing countries like poland or romania invest almost all the money in the infrastructure , because : a ) we have absolutely no fucking idea what else we can do with the money , b ) the richest countries ( eg . 
  germany ) profit from it as they produce and sell a lot of materials and stuff we have to use in order to build the infrastructure . 
  over 7 million poles earn less than 166 eur/month , 75 % of us earn less than 715 eur/month and what we do about that ? 
  we paint buildings ( it 's almost like a national sport nowadays , notice the three on the left are already done , the one on the right was transformed - by the way i have no idea who chooses the patterns but sometimes the buildings look worse after than before ) : http://imgur.com/a/obuzm we 're also very good with sidewalk renovation ( and sometimes we even put some flowers here and there ) : http://imgur.com/a/wawjj ( the unemployment in this area is close to 35 % and people earn 350 eur/month on average , but shut up and be happy , enjoy your pavement ) . 
  but come on poland , sidewalks ? 
  you can do better . 
  let 's start with airports !, 
  107m eur : the most important , modlin airport right next to our capital city , warsaw , got closed right on the spot for six months : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw\u2013modlin_mazovia_airport#runway_closure right now only ryanair uses this airpot and they 're planning to move to chopin airport based in warsaw anyway , so they might most likely cut many flights from modlin . 
  50m eur : szymany airport - i will just give you google map link and you can figure it yourself ( yes this is in the middle of fucking nowhere ) : https://www.google.pl/maps/place/szymany/@53.4553719,20.8241225,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x471df03e64abf2e9:0xd53b9b09d02c22b0 20m eur : radom airport - my favorite , in the recent years we managed to build 4 major airports around radom , so when they built their own ( because why not ! ), 
  not a single airlines wanted to fly from there , for over a year the customs were walking around the security checks just to `` get the grip of it '' ( after all after year without passengers you might forget how to do your job , right ? 
  ) , amusing especially for the kids that were often present in the airport as school tours from the whole area used to visit the airport just for fun . 
  here you can see a school tour and customs doing fake security checks for them : http://www.echodnia.eu/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?newtbl=1&amp;site=ed&amp;date=20140524&amp;category=galeria12&amp;artno=524009999&amp;ref=ph&amp;item=2&amp;maxw=670&amp;maxh=600&amp;border=0 luckily just recently air baltic decided to fly to and from radom airport , the first flight carried 7 passengers on board ... 
  highways : for everyone who thinks `` the infrastructure makes countries rich '' i have bad news . 
  even if that happens to be true - polish highways are not free to use , furthermore they 're most likely the most expensive roads to use in the whole eu if not the world !, 
  here 's a proof : http://www.newsweek.pl/g/i.aspx/720/0/newsweek/635566769353303556.jpg so basically , if you want to go from middle of the country ( \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ) to the german border ( 340 km ) you have to pay ~ 19 eur . 
  that 's more than many poles make a day . 
  and you have to pay every time you use the road , you ca n't get `` subscription '' of any sort . 
  so yeah ... and my personal favorite from ( poor ) city my parents came from - we 're building tram lines for over 105m eur . 
  people do n't really use public communication in that particular city ( most of them have cars , note they 're mosty 15-20 year old cars ) and the city itself is quite small . 
  the public transport in city inhabited by 200k citiznes moves less than 100m ( possibly around 50m ) passengers yearly and it 's decreasing every year , while in warsaw it 's over 1 billion people yearly . 
  so what you can do in a city where people do n't use public communication ? 
  invest in public transportation , for sure !, 
  http://tramwajowo.blog.pl/files/2013/10/trasy-tramwajowe-olsztyn.jpg sorry romania , you got it all wrong and you will see it in just 10 years if not earlier . 
  tl ; dr infrastructure will not help you , after all poor people living in renovated houses , walking on renovated pavements will remain poor . 
  you have to invest in other stuff first , like people ( education ) , specialists , companies , law improvements . 
  paving bricks suck , ask roller skaters . 
  there 's no irony at all , poles are in the uk legally , try to get to any civilized , non-brainwashed by the commies , country illegally and share the experience . 
  plot twist : you will get shot in many cases . 
  that 's how the racists of north america do it : http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/10/31/ef742d75-4782-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/620x350/2f8f3e6dfa195679f763c020eb7019b9/usmexborder_183004973.jpg, 
  there 's plenty of expats in poland , in warsaw especially and they 're doing just fine , especially british and north american folks love the place , lately we 're getting really popular among young italians . 
  we also have second generation of polish-vietnamese ( 20-40k people ) and they 're living happy lives and are generally respected and well-off in many cases . 
  i 'd say poland is a great place to be if you can afford earning less than in western europe , you 're willing to work and you 're here legally . 
  i can even couchsurf you myself . 
  if you 're an illegal immigrant , that 's a whole different story . 
  what country / city do you live in if i might ask ? 
  i 'm polish and in warsaw it 's not that hard to earn 650 euros , while you could get a whole flat for 450 euro a month , and we 're fucked economically anyway compared to western nations .

  here are 10 interpretations who started ( or was most responsible for ) the ww i outbreak , 9 of 10 times it includes germany , 2 times exclusively , not sure why downvoting : http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26048324, 
  the last thing we should care about now is being tasteful . 
  sorry , but you 're missing the point . 
  it 's really hard to get driver 's license in poland , actually the fail rate of around 70 % makes it literally impossible to get the license here for many people . 
  there are around 3k really tricky questions you have to know the answers for , then over 30 hours of driving after a few weeks of theoretical lessons . 
  it 's actually easier to get to drive a car in almost every country in the world . 
  the problem is our driving culture here sucks , not the driving skills . 
  same goes for italy , have you seen roads in towns in southern italy ? 
  or ever tried to park a car in genua ? 
  i 'd say 1 in 100 german drivers would be able to park their car in genua . 
  in fact , in poland we dislike german drivers for their lack od skills , especially on worse roads with speed limits of 70-90 km . 
  who drives 50 km/h there ? 
  of course germans only . 
  around 4x slower than russians ( damn , these folks are crazy ) . 
  i 've been visiting my relatives in leicester , uk and looks like it 's not all that bad . 
  in leicester you could find a decent place to live for 100-120k gbp , the minimum wage is 5.3 gbp/hr , if you work in any factory you should make around 1k gbp monthly , so for a couple it makes 2k . 
  i 've seen couples working overtime and saving around 1k monthly , after 5 years have muuuney for half of the house . 
  i 've never ever seen people in poland working basic jobs and even thinking about buying a house , while in the uk it is possible or at least was 2 years ago , it seems . 
  for comparison a decent-sized flat in poland would be around 200k pln in towns where you could make 1,4 k pln in a factory tops , usually less . 
  for warsaw it would more lore like 400-450k pln for a decent-sized flat and around 1,8-2k salary . 
  so the flats are 2-4x more expensive here than in the uk , relatively . 
  and unfortunately , shitton of people still buys them ( thanks banks ) so it wo n't change for better anytime soon . 
  i 'm not thinking of buying my own place in near future , with these prices it makes no sense at all , though 100-150k for a semi-detached house in the uk still looks like a bargain to me . 
  of course london is the whole different story . 
  wow , how it 's even possible ? 
  i mean , you 've got your own house you paid for and then government requires you to do `` this or that '' and if you do n't obey they just take the house away from you ? 
  can you give me some examples/links ? 
  where shit like this happens ? 
  sounds crazy ... 
  not really , check out wikipedia , this is actually quite interesting if you consider how the crash site looked like . 
  `` ziad jarrah and saeed al-ghamdi 's passports were recovered from the flight 93 crash site . '', 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_airlines_flight_93, 
  and how two terrorists passports from united airlines flight 93 were found ? 
  how about other 9/11 passports ? 
  not an expert but these people obviously wanted to be known , recognized and maybe even praised by their folks , i find it funny most of western guys ca n't wrap their heads about the simple fact - `` if you 're going to kill yourself in the name of the idea you fight for you want to be remembered and recognized '' .
