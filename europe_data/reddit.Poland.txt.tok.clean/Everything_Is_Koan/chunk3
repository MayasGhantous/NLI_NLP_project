  you 're really succeding in looking stupid so i 'll walk you through : you said australia is not a good country to learn something from because of their past and you do n't trust them . 
  you also said that you do n't trust your own countrymen . 
  so i sarcastically pointed that you must hate other countries for shit they did in past . 
  suddenly you asked if italy is bringing slavery back , totalluy out of nowhere . 
  like it has anything to do with current discussion so i assumed that you compare italy to australia . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  australia is not trying to `` bring slavery back '' , there was n't even any official slavery in asutralia you uneducated twat !, 
  you got lost in an example , i can understand it , so i 'll reiterate my point without sarcasm : it is very , very stupid thing to judge a whole nation based on part of their history . 
  and he 's doing in in a very poor way , with shitty arguments not based in reality . 
  your familiar with the matter of people being raped and not reporting it anywhere so much that you know how many of those cases happens ? 
  that does n't sound right . 
  oh , right , it could be like this . 
  yeah , in this case it 's pure vigilantism . 
   as op suggested edit : in case there 's still a misunderstanding : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59u774/the_poles_looking_to_leave_the_uk_after_brexit/d9bea0m/, 
  tbh the lines between those two are pretty blured . 
  do you want a person saving another person live take time to asses if his defense is not too violent ? 
  those are life and death situatuions, 
  poland is not eually poor as bulgaria . 
  do you or do you not comprehanmd that fact ? 
  what is your basis to calling me dumb , aside from the fact that i disagreed with you ? 
  is it possible that you 're not only smug but also a total asshole ? 
  no it does not and i ca n't fathom how coluld you think like that . 
  poland ** is not ** almost as poor as bulgaria as op suggested , however you twist the words . 
  if you have a proof that it is please provide it , otherwise my argument stands . 
   jesus christ that does not change a simple fact : poland and bulgaria are not `` almost equally poor '' countries like op said . 
  this is all i care about in this thread and this was only intention of my first comment here . 
  where do you see me comparing belarus to bulgaria ? 
   poland 's gdp is 474 billion . 
  jesus christ that does not change a simple fact : poland and bulgaria are not `` almost equally poor '' countries like op said . 
  so you 're going to post a vague statement that is not based on anything and just feel that your work here is done ? 
  why are you lying in the first place if you do n't even care if anyone believes you ? 
  in what way ? 
  different species live there ? 
  does it look different ? 
  will the moose feel awkward in `` human part '' of the forest or it wo n't make a difference to him ? 
  if those parts are the same as protected parts in ecological functionality i do n't see why we ca n't also protect it . 
  you 're right but that 's barely different , only 40 bilion more compared to poland 's 1.003 trillion . 
  nope , they green lighted the part that is not a reservation , not `` human planted '' . 
  only 1/3 of polish part of bialowieza is protected . 
  would you accept cutting out 2/3rd of it because `` it 's not primordial '' ? 
  it 's not , but it 's still more `` wild '' than any other forest in the eu . 
  i 'm done . 
  that 's not how forests work . 
  this is such an oversimplification that only a person with barely any biology knowledge can belief this . 
  this type of beetle lived there for thousands of years and bialowieza is still intact . 
  some parts of the forest die , another grows , dead trees decompose , giving life to organisms that need dead trees and the cycle goes on . 
  one time its that part of a forest with dead trees and in 200 years it will be another . 
  this process went on and on and everything fine so please , explain me one more time why we need to intervene and cut out shitton of trees . 
  what 's wrong with you , how can anyone who can read and speak english believe what our govt `` specialists '' say without double cecking ? 
  trying to be smug without contributin ... well , i blame you . 
  you still have to sorry for lithuania you deutscher order son of a bitch !!, 
  `` australia did something wrong , they do n't have anything we coould learn hurrr durrr '' , holy fuck , you 're dense . 
  you must hate italians for all those poor gladiators . 
  and do n't forget about egyptians and how those bastards treated poor jews . 
  oh , and you 're a german , we had a war with you in 1410 so fuck you , you 're evil . 
  you 're fucked up , i 'm happy that you will never have any power . 
  facts ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  your previous post :  these example are not as numerous as you make it sound and you know it because ? 
  i 'm sure you 're not pulling this out of your ass right ? 
  you have some solid numbers , right ? / s if that 's your `` fact '' then i 'll take his emotions over your `` facts '' any day . 
  and wrong jab !, 
  i ca n't remember a single instance of him using current year as an argument . 
  as a joke ? 
  yes , numerous times . 
  find me one example of john oliver using this as an argument , not as a joke like '' [ ... ] also known as giant shitshow 2016 '' . 
  # [ a fucking hashtag , kurwa ma\u0107 ] giantmeteor2016 edit : why ca n't i put hashtag and see hashtag ? 
  edit2 : no matter formatting , it 's still all bold an no # anywhere , fuck edit3 : fuck it , you catch my drift . 
  a shitfuckton of human decisions are completely emotion free and instead are based in math etc. 
   jesus christ it 's like you people who ? 
  but you clearly defined them as losers , as people who lost the game . 
  and i do n't think anyone views brexit this way . 
  save your sibling from being raped in a sensible , calm fashion as to avoid harming rapist too much . / s jesus christ ... 
  i do n't . 
  i see this post , where a guy condems their brother for saving him : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59omhm/hamburg_gang_rape_teenagers_suspended_sentences/d9ak69b/ and i have to wonder if the west is really sick if this is the attitude anyone in there can have . 
  wait , you do n't approve someone beating would-be-rapist to save almost-raped person ? 
  would you stand by idly and just nwait for the police and count on them arriving fast enough so the victim is not killed ? 
  this is sick . 
  barely . 
  because revision takes time and during that time criminal can pose a danger to society . 
  why ? 
  what 's wrong with `` if they 're free until the end of an appeal they may pose a danger and rape again '' logic ? 
  you get arrogant and try to diminish what he said but you do n't offer anything in return , no explanation , nothing . 
  this is assholish move . 
  no one will think you 're right just because you say so . 
   the court of appeal will fix that . 
  jesus christ , your world is some kind of utopia :d, 
  eastern europe is not only russia . 
  since when populism is `` balls '' ? 
  :d you seriously believe that their motivation is to `` stick it up '' ? 
  this is pure populism and playing to their voters base . 
  notice how much they declare and how much they actually do later . 
  this is their game : promise something that appeals to catholic fanatics , wait until turmoil stirs and everyone is pissed off and then `` gracefully '' striking down controversial bill . 
  catholic voters feel like they 've been listened to but `` fucking leftists '' destroyed everything and non-catholics feel like govt actually listens to . 
  oh our govt is indeed ill advised , do n't you worry . 
  recently they green lighted deforestation in a last virgin european forest - bialowieza forest . 
  they said that they have an expert opinion and that expert stated that it 's ok and wo n't hurt enviroment . 
  their expert ? 
  chainsaw engeneering specialist ( no fucking joke ) you do n't know even half of the shitshow we have here , your media just ca n't keep up with this monty python so i assure you : it 's waaaay worse than they describe . 
  keep creating your own mythology :d,
