  i know there are assholes everywhere but i spent shitload of time hitchhiking in europe and honestly , only places where i was met with such language based hostility was france and lithuania . 
  i also met nice people in france of course but the balance between assholes ( it was n't just one situation it was a week full of discrimination , with police refusing to help and other shits ) and them was not like i seen anywhere in the west . 
  crossing the border with belgium was like heaven and hell . 
  you 're imagining things . 
  i 'm trying to help and advise you and you think you 're under attack . 
  but it 's also my bad , sometimes i use caps instead of ** bold ** , cause i 'm a lazy fuck :d, 
  for future reference : adding keywords like `` job '' , `` agency '' will really help when looking for job agencies . 
  economic factor is more important in my opinion and it always was . 
  minimum wage in ukraine is almost 10 % of polish ( 430 euro vs 48 euro ) . 
  i think that for most people perspective of earning 10 times more money for the same job in a country with ** very ** simmiliar language and culture is largely appealing . 
   but , in response , ms may pointed out she had called on saudi arabia to investigate the allegations about yemen when she met with the kingdom 's deputy crown prince at the recent g20 summit in china . 
  nothing to see here people , she told saudi prince to investigate saudi war crimes so it 's all fine / s it 's so easy to hate a politician so fast after taking office ... 
  they did a very good job at defending wtc , right ? 
  oh wait , hijackers were saudi . 
  no , they contacted some job agency and month later they had a job and a place to live in poland . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  no one here mentions syria . 
  https://www.ottoworkforce.com/en/ http://www.arcus.pl/en/company literally first google results . 
  did you even tried ? 
  u/altnume21 , my friend came here half a year ago and now he is making 2000 pln working in a kitchen . 
  compare % of arable land in texas and in poland . 
  no , he meant a wise chinese man for fucks sake . 
  there is overabundance of food and water in poland , do n't you worry . 
  food will be a problem if we let population number fall down as there will not be a lot of people to work the damn fields . 
  one french lady could n't figure what i mean ( we spoke in english , her was bad to mediocre ) when i say `` scorpion '' . 
  turn out she could n't understand be because of the `` n '' in the end . 
  if i have said `` scorpio '' there woudl n't be a problem . 
  what the fuck ? 
  except there is and i was met with far worse reaction to my botched french or me speaking english . 
  i was told to `` go back to your fucking pologne , you do n't speak french you do n't come to france '' by a gas station worker . 
  i had met people who got verbaly aggresive for speaking english . 
  and some more . 
  french people are the worst when it comes to being nationalist prick about their language . 
  my 2 ukrainian friends who live in poland moved here from charkiv and lviv , not very war-torn regions :p, 
  yup . 
  even letter g is strange in dutch . 
  how to pronounce dutch g : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yri2-bz7wpc p.s. 
  and now when you know it - realise how you pronounce van gogh properly and die laughing . 
  but without usual hard `` g '' and instead with a sound you make when you clear your throat . 
  maybe not all religious dietary restrictions are rationale ? 
  so what it 's doing in here , without even a warning ? 
  this is just decieving . 
  it 's hard not to . 
  i think this is one of those times when people with tin-foil hats are right . 
  this shit does n't hold up . 
  i was never protesting on a street and yes , i was angry as fuck back then . 
  and yes they were . 
  and now it 's worse . 
  so stop with this retarded argument `` buh , buh , but they did it too ! '' . 
  so fucking what ?!, 
  if some fucker breakes into my house and steals my tv i wo n't be happy if another one breakes right after him to steal my pc . 
  1000 years and we still have potatoes like you . 
  yes , i 'm a disgrace because i 'm capable of respecting other nations and not thinking with general , stereotypical statement . 
  sorry but `` us citizens are very dumb '' makes you by default unworthy of any respect in conversation and i 'm happy to be regarded a disgrace by a shit like you . 
  a real disgrace , not i real disgrace if you want to play grammar nazi . 
  and `` polish '' , not `` polish '' . 
  you have to add / s. 
  you seriously have to . 
  because what you 've said is one of the main arguments of pis supporters when they defend what they 're doing . 
  it 's retarted , i know but you can see/hear it everyday ... 
  so seriously , almost no one from poland is going to get that this is sarcasm , hence your downvotes :p, 
  do you even news ? 
  are you living in a cave ? 
  dismantling a body that is meant to keep government in check is not changing the democracy ? 
  jesus christ , how can someone claiming to be educated spewing this bullshit . 
  of course , we have manipulated media , our justice minister was appointed attorney general ( which was a bad idea even years ago ) , massive installation of pis people on every stage of government but yeah , nothing changed . 
  are you fucking blind ? 
  so i can now beat someone to get my boss in trouble ? 
  none , this is just a favourite argument of a current ruling party supporters . 
  `` but the guys before were also doing bad shit , so why do you criticize pis ? '', 
  someone broke into my house so it 's ok if suddenly another guy appears and rape my wife . 
  this is so retarted my eyes hurt . 
  how can someone have such primitive views on politics is beyond me . 
  no he did not . 
  do n't come to english subs if you ca n't read in this language . 
  maybe you do n't know what it is , mauybe your uneducated , ignorant friend do n't . 
  but please , do n't try to lie and say that we 're all equally retarded and ignorant . 
  i 'm pole and i do care . 
  do n't listen to this idiot with a comment history of a tracksuit wearing imbecile . 
  oh , and it 's constitutional tribunal , not tribunal court ( wtf ? ), 
  you goddamn moron !, 
  your fixated and maniacal about bashing us . 
  therefore your credibility is borderline non-existant . 
  and to add to that you 're retarded enough to generalize all us citizens . 
  you 're so much smarter then us citizen , right ? 
  where 's your fucking rocket to the moon ? 
  where 's your silicon valley ? 
  where 's your shitload of scientists creating a shitload of inventions ? 
  `` oh look , it 's that guy again , saying the same stuff again '' . 
  go back to your fucking potato farm you little turd . 
  i 'm not saying anything about the state of our universities , i 'm dismissing the state of your education . 
  to be `` educated '' and to say that you do n't care about the state of democracy in youre country is an oxymoron to me . 
  so why do you lie in favor of pis ? 
  why do you call journalists that tried to uphold journalist standards po supporter ? 
  so what who 's whom wife ? 
  did wp lied ? 
  nope , tvp totally lied about what obama said , and yesterday in wiadomo\u015bci they 've said that obama did n't said what wp said that he said . 
  and this is a lie , anyone who knows english can hear what he said . 
  dear redditors , please , ignore pistroll . 
  they will try to tell you that this is just some leftist propaganda , that this is just swines sqeeling after they 've lost their food .
