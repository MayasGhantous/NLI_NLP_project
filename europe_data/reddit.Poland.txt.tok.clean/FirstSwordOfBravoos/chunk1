you guys have money , just take these bloody olympics , i do n't want them in poland . 
  it was a serious answer though . 
  and cyrilic still does n't have every sound that is used in polish so we would still need some special marks . 
  no no , russia is enemy as well . 
  you know , we have enemies everywhere , west , east , north , south . 
  oh , and jews . 
  never forget about jews . 
  no , smole\u0144sk is not the the biggest debate anymore . 
  i 'd say ukraine is the most important right now . 
  also debate about pedophilia among the priests and disgusting comments from bishops about molesting kids it pretty big . 
  1st most of the countries that join eu after 2005 benefited greatly from eu funds , but poland is the biggest and the highest populated country of `` new '' eu so obviously we are getting a lot of money . 
  i 'm sure ukraine would get its share in time . 
  2nd published : march 15 , 1991 we were in similar if not worse situation then greece , so some of our debt was written-off , because west would n't get these money anyway . 
  i do n't know what it has to do with ukraine . 
  we pay our debts since then . 
  you ca n't forbit any march to go literally anywhere , or ban demonstration . 
  we have very liberal laws in that matter here in poland , because you know , freedom etc. 
  not even poles . 
  they were never in europe . 
  same as cyprus for that matter . 
  sweden is bigger country than poland ( 449,964 km2 to 312,679 km2 ) , but in poland three times more populated ( 38,5 m to 9,5 m ) and population density is six times higher ( 120/km2 to 20/km2 ) . 
  i honestly can not name one person without access to the internet . 
  ** poland ** * flooding danger in southern poland * cardinal said that gods law should stay above human law , and parliament 's job is not to question morality that comes from god ( obviously ) * last round of polish football league and some tennis, 
  there is a tournament in paris . 
  some call it french open , others roland garros , world 's biggest tournament on clay , one of four grand slams many frenchmen are playing , some really well . 
  too bad we do n't any party like that in poland .

  so many smiths in almost every country . 
  every east european country in eu is more or less `` westernized '' , whatever that means . 
  so , protest vote wins election . 
  pretty much sums up what greeks thinks about their political class . 
  * snow and low temperature - we do n't like -10 . 
  also no hot water and power supply in some places due to snow * ridiculous amount of speed cameras . 
  our current pm said few years ago , that only guy without driving licence can set so many speed cameras , but now we have more of them than ever . 
  people think that 's the way to reduce budget debt , not safety . 
  * smolensk crash episode 134532 * january uprising - polish love to argue about history ( or i should say polish politicians ) . 
  and we love to celebrate lost wars and uprisings . 
  * armstong and doping in sport, 
   the guy did create independent poland after 123 years of opression exactly this . 
  unfortunately , we ignore everything else . 
  that 's excacly how pis sees eu . 
  take as much money as possible because we are `` victims '' of communism and west `` abandoned '' us in ww2 so they have to pay for their `` sins '' . 
  total population of those countries ( except poland ) is 43.5 millions , just above 38.3 millions of poland . 
   he is a satirist , is n't he ? 
  i wish , but he 's serious . 
  i honestly do n't understand his popularity among younger poles . 
  he wins almost all ` elections ' in high schools , usually by a large margin . 
  he is extremely liberal economically and and as conservative as you can be ( anti gay , women should n't have rights to vote etc. ) . 
  most of his voters wo n't vote for him once they 'll have some ` real-life ' experience . 
  he 's quite funny if you listen to him and he 's only in eu parliament because of low turnout in elections . 
  pis got only 26 % from under 30 voters , but if you add up results of pis , kukiz and korwin ( those two are even more right wing and anti-eu ) you will get astonishing 62 % of votes . 
  so young poles are even right wing than older ones . 
   national rebirth of poland  division england that 's unbelievable . 
  i didnt know these people really exist . 
  it 's like in this polish meme , ` poland for poles , england for english and poles . 
  and image how sexy we would be !, 
  holy fuck dude . 
  no wonder people says polish are butthurt . 
   found the bavarian !!!, 
  that 's a brave thing so say to a guy named ` u/frankonia ', 
  i 'm not opposing any of it , i 'm just saying that when independence of out courts is in jeopardy , our public tv is reaching north korea level of propaganda , our government and president just ignore constitution , debt is rising and rising , and we are losing every ally we had , same-sex marriage is not a crucial issue right now . 
  and mind you , lgbtq rights have n't changed in any way since we have this government ( thankfully ) . 
   a party that opposes same-sex marriage , are highly critical of lgbtq and narrowly failed to ban abortion under all circumstances there are a lot of more important problems with pis than this ... 
  not a chance , as long as their polls are looking as they are now ( ~ 35 % ) . 
  most of pis ' leaders are either hardcore ideologist and they believe in all the crap they say or opportunists and they will do and say whatever they have to to keep their voters happy . 
  the core of pis , the ideologists wo n't leave party no matter what , but if kaczy\u0144ski leaves politics ( that can only happen if he 's seriously ill or he 'll just die ) pis would split into many groups . 
  actually few years ago some quite a few mps left the party , they created 3 or 4 different parties but none of them could get even 5 % in elections so i they will think twice before they would leave pis again . 
  and going back to the polls , they have n't really changed since election , their voters seems to be happy with what we have now , but next elections are in 2.5 years so a lot can still happen . 
  well said , you are 100 % right . 
  i would add that polish goverment media are already twisting facts and saying tusk was a german candidate . 
  they are citing merkel supporting him as a prove ignoring fact that every single country except ours voted for tusk . 
   i hope to go there sometime else again !, 
  you should visit strasbourg instead . 
  i 've seen both parliaments but i was more impressed with strasbourg . 
  jesus ... do they give them away for free ? 
  edit : actually i know where it is , so i guess they are just hungry pwr students . 
  one can only hope . 
  but for so many people being pole equals being a catholic . 
   they have underrated food like what exactly ? 
  it 's a weird thing to hear from a french . 
  i meant or not for , idk what f is doing here . 
  it 's great seeing poland ahead of most european countries . 
  i remember how rampant corruption was in the '90s . 
  as a common citizen you just ca n't bribe anyone any more which is the opposite from my parents ' generation when you had to bribe doctors to get a good treatment for police to avoid tickets . 
  good job czechy , we are barely ahead while our population is bigger more then 3 times . 
  most of these people are pro eu money though . 
   the only things i understood from this was jesus , god and thursday . 
  add a day off and that 's all you need to know about it . 
  exactly the same . 
  if a shop is opened you can buy anything you want no matter what day is it . 
  i ca n't think of any major institution that is not located in warsaw . 
  it 's jan kowalski in polish , means pretty much the same as john smith . 
  sometimes i see jan nowak as it 's also very popular last name . 
  actually drinking is forbidden on streets , parks and public squares so they could drink legally . 
  it 's a bit controversial where it is allowed to drink or not , few days ago our court defined what exactly is a street as a guy did n't agree with ticket for drinking on dike ( i think ? ),
