i 've translated the article into english , for non-polish speakers :  ** gen. wojciech jaruzelski has died . 
  he was 90 . 
  ** after a long and difficult struggle with cancer , wojciech jaruzelski has died , confirmed former president of the polish press agency , aleksander kwa\u015bniewski . 
  not long ago , jaruzelski experienced a stroke . 
  he was a first secretary of the central committee of the polish united workers ' party , prime minister of the polish people 's republic , chairman of the polish council of state , and president of poland . 
  he was 90 years of age . 
  gen. jaruzelski died on sunday at 15:24 in the military hospital by szaser\u00f3w street in warsaw , where he stayed for a few months with breaks . 
  the chief of the presidential press office joanna trzaska-wieczorek stated : `` before committing to any action regarding the funeral of general wojciech jaruzelski , it is important to recognize the will of the family . '', 
  ** the general was very ill . 
  he practically did not leave his home for 2 years . 
  ** for two years , the life of jaruzelski alternated between home and hospital . 
  `` i feel very ill , so i almost never leave home . 
  i am too weak to go somewhere or actively spend my time , '' reported a magazine in mid-may . 
  in the discussion , he admitted that he was not counting on a recovery any longer . 
  in 2009 , jaruzelski underwent an operation to remove a tumor from his face . 
  afterwards , he went to the hospital several times due to lung inflammation and heart weakness . 
  doctors stated that these were associated with the tumor . 
  last year , doctors from the military medical institute in warsaw diagnosed a growing cancer . 
  it turned out that it was lymphoma ; chemotherapy was begun , which jaruzelski struggled to undergo . 
  during a longer stay in the hospital , jaruzelski was visited by former president lech wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  [ on the internet , he posted an image with the label , `` mr. general , \\ [ i wish you \\ ] health . 
  '' ] ( http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114873,10349572,walesa_odwiedzil_jaruzelskiego_w_szpitalu___panie.html )  ** siberia and the general 's dark glasses ** wojciech jaruzelski was born in 1923 in kur\u00f3w . 
  before the war , he was a student of a high school run by the marian order in the bielany district of warsaw . 
  from 10 years of age , jaruzelski lived in boarding school . 
  `` every morning , a priest strides into the 20-person hall , clapping ; ` get up , get up . ', 
  everyone kneels by their beds and say a prayer , '' [ cited the gazeta wyborcza . 
  in 1940 , when the country was annexed by the soviet union , he was sent to siberia , where he worked in the taiga by a clearing . 
  difficult conditions caused snow blindness , which affected his vision in the long-term . 
  during his deportation in siberia , he lost his father . 
   ** military career ** jaruzelski wanted to join gen. anders ' army . 
  eventually , he was drafted to the 2nd infantry division of henryk d\u0105browski . 
  he took part in battles by the vistula , on magnuszewski 's beachhead , for warsaw , for the pomeranian embankment , and also by the baltic , oder , and elbe . 
  according to the institute of national remembrance , from the end of the war until 1954 , he cooperated with the military information under the pseudonym `` wolski . '', 
  jaruzelski denies this . 
  in 1962 , he was appointed as vice-minister of national defense . 
  from 1965 , he fulfilled the function of chief of the polish general staff . 
  in 1968 , he was appointed as lt. general and minster of national defense , which he headed until 1983 . 
  his subordinate units took part in the suppression of the prague spring by warsaw pact forces in operation danube . 
  wojciech jaruzelski also oversaw the suppression of workers during the events of december 1970 by the coast . 
  he was accused of co-responsibility for these bloody events . 
  jaruzelski claimed that the order of shooting at the workers fell upon the highest administration of the polish united workers ' party , to which he then did not belong to as a substitute member of the politburo , and that he does not carry responsibility for what occurred . 
  as the commander of the armed forces of the polish people 's republic , on 16 july 1975 , he expressed agreement to shooting down a polish civil an-2 aircraft , whose pilot , dionizy biela\u0144ski , wanted to escape to austria . 
   ** martial law ** from august 1980 , with the national defense committee and the general staff of the polish army , he began work upon instituting martial law in poland . 
  on 12 november 1980 , two days after the official registration of the trade union `` solidarno\u015b\u0107 , '' he revealed at a meeting of kok that he had prepared a set of necessary legislation regarding martial law . 
  on 5 december , at the summit of warsaw pact countries in moscow , gen. wojciech jaruzelski introduced the idea to independently liquidate solidarno\u015b\u0107 and opposition whenever they show initial signs of exhausting society . 
  on 13 december 1981 , he declared martial law in poland and headed the military council of national salvation . 
  according to estimated by the institute of national remembrance , from december 1981 to july 1983 , during the communist-imposed martial law , as a result of shootings and beatings during strikes and demonstrations , at least 56 persons died . 
  in february 1992 , the sejm voted with a large majority to adopt a resolution that recognized the decision to implement martial law as contrary to the constitution of the polish people 's republic . 
  a special commission was appointed to hear the then-members of the council of state , but the parliament was concluded after a year , and the power of the democratic left alliance and polish people 's party resigned from the investigation . 
   ** after the round table ** in the mid-80s , jaruzelski resigned from the office of prime minister and became the head of the council of state . 
  in 1989 , he agreed to the proceedings of the round table , which resulted in the political transformation of the people 's republic of poland . 
  in 1989 , he was chosen as president , which he remained until 1990 , when lech wa\u0142\u0119sa won . 
  in january 1991 , the general finished his career of military service . 
  from 1993 , in the anniversary of the announcement of martial law , demonstrations of opponents and supporters of the institution of martial law occurred before wojciech jaruzelski 's house in the mokot\u00f3w district of warsaw . 
  wojciech jaruzelski received many awards -- among others , the silver cross of the virtuti militari , order of the builders of people 's poland , knight 's cross and officer 's cross of the order of polonia restituta , as well as twice cross of valor . 
  in march 2006 , jaruzelski was awarded a siberian exiles cross by president lech kaczy\u0144ski . 
  commenting on this , he stated that he is joyous that president kaczy\u0144ski has risen above and beyond historical divisions . 
  the office of the president immediately stated that jaruzelski was awarded due to a mistake , because `` the president only accepted provisions , but not lists of people '' and did not recognize that wojciech jaruzelski was present on the list . 
  after this statement , jaruzelski returned his award to the presidential palace . 
  interesting .

  apologies for the misunderstanding . 
  i hope your contempt is also a misunderstanding . 
  perhaps an unbiased , impartial argument would be best ? 
  purely out of curiosity , why do n't you want norway to join the eu ?

  [ precautions .

  [ kazimierz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casimir ) can mean `` someone who destroys opponent 's prestige/glory during battle '' ( kazi\u0107 + mir ) . 
  i 'm curious , what does that mean ? 
  [ here you go !, 
  well , it 's brunet . 
  it 's just used so rarely that most people do n't know it .

  it makes sense to me that the poles who moved to the [ recovered territories ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recovered_territories ) , who were less likely to feel a connection to their homes , today feel less of a connection to poland as a home . 
  well , it 's not like americans can pride themselves for being americans . 
  when a country gets zero points in eurovision . 
  it 's rare because every participating country awards 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 points ; getting nul points requires a country to not receive any points from any country . 
  executivemonkey is a novelty account ; my understanding is he parodies the negative stereotype of americans here .

   what do you like about this sub ? 
  what makes you stick around ? 
  i enjoy the novel questions that i might not have ever considered before , and i enjoy learning things that i would n't otherwise have learned about europe . 
  i do see flaws , as outlined below , but they 're definitely outweighed by the benefits !, 
   what could use an improvement ? 
  there are too many questions about tourism and usa . 
  i imagine most people here are uninterested in generic tourism questions , and while the name `` askeurope '' does n't imply that questions need be limited to the topic of europe , i believe most people here are most interested in european matters . 
  thank you very much !,

  edit : whoops , [ no need ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/5ypbmd/jesus_theres_another_one_of_these_bots_running/ ) for me to complain ; it 's already being made fun of !,
