  pis is highballing it . 
  a new , more tame , law will come soon , which was probably their original aim . 
  they want you to celebrate and think that it 's a victory , but it 's a bamboozle . 
  mark my words , i do n't trust them . 
  i was angry about all the buzz , because everyone was blaming pis for that law , yet they were not the ones who created it , and many of their members voted against it . 
  also , everyone was terribly disinformed about the contents of the law , noone actually read it . 
  i expected that , i was 99 % sure the pis wo n't do it in the end . 
  and mind you i 'm saying pis , because i do n't think the president is fully independent from the party . 
  pis is probably just testing waters . 
  well , then they could say that the state department says it . 
  edit ; fucking hell it 's hot in poland here i 'm going to drink 90 cold beers . 
  i 'd love for them to lose majority . 
  there is an option where they lose majority and are forced to go into a coalition with kukiz ( centre-right ) . 
  the upside of that is that kukiz is at least consistent with their support of pis . 
  sometimes they support them , sometimes not , they 're ambivalent to say it simply . 
  that 's better than opposition 's attitude , which is attack pis no matter what , kaczynski could fucking end world hunger and the opposition would protest . 
  edit : oh , and as far as the ` majority-ness ' of polish goverments goes , last time was during communism ... 
  so not very common . 
  well , i disagree , nowoczesna is simply funny , they keep making mistakes and their people say some mind bogglingly stupid shit on air . 
  po 's reputation is stained to the point of no return , not much else is to say about that . 
  i know , i checked her . 
  and do you think that the title should say ` us ' warns ? 
  what constitutes us ? 
  so some lady said that and it 's ` us ' ? 
  man , i fucking hate those shitty article titles , ` russia says turkey is bad ' , and it 's just some random journalist , but it 's russia now . 
  journalism yay . 
  this article fucking blows dicks . 
  despite snarky and condescending responses to you , you are basically right . 
  and that 's a good thing , a catholic country is a good country . 
  yes , but more because the opposition is very incompetent and simply , bad . 
  expect more pis shenanigans for many years . 
  that sounds reasonable , i can agree . 
  democratic party doubled down on the sjw shit during the last election and that was one of the reasons trump won . 
  endless pandering to lgbt , mexicans and blacks is n't helping because those groups generally do n't vote and they 're , well , minorities . 
  in the end , aiming the company at the average white american , the biggest demographic group , proved more useful . 
  europeans against extreme immigration into the eu are a majority now , and aiming your company at them should be obvious . 
  conservatives are cashing down on the immigration problem while libeals blindly double down and keep repeating the same buzzwords . 
  i 'd gladly vote for a reasonable centre party in poland , if there was a competent one ... 
  right now , the opposition in sejm is pathetic , fortunately for pis . 
   kukiz ( potential pis ally ) kukiz said that he can go for temporary coalition aimed to push a certain law , but they will not vote for something that they will disagree with . 
  your comment seems pretty ignorant . 
   there are only two 2 ways for a dictatorship poland is not a dictatorship . 
   or they keep on their route to fascism pis has nothing to do with fascism . 
   go back under the russian influence pis ** hates ** russia . 
  what 's your point ? 
  pis hates russia , they 're more alligned with america . 
  but you did n't say exactly what eu needs to do . 
  how exactly are they supposed to stop ` enabling ' right wing parties ? 
  what do you suggest they do ? 
   the populist right is suddenly much more positive about the polish people i see that happening in many european countries right now . 
  nah , people make different choices . 
  i know a bunch of dudes who drop out because they just want to start working . 
  that 's why men are dominant in some areas , and women in others , it 's no big deal . 
  because the president already said he 's not signing this law until it 's properly researched and fixed , and the protest happened anyway . 
  come on , most nations have some badass historical warriors like vikings or roman soldiers , why poland ca n't have some fun too ? 
  the soviet grave containing russian soldiers which fought against nazis in my hometown has soviet/communist symbols such as red star and hammer and sickle . 
  we should at least be allowed to remove those symbols , which mean oppression for most polish people . 
  i am not necessarily advocating for destroying graves , but the communist symbols are an insult . 
  whatever , just put a damn russian flag or coat of arms , but not that which offends many poles . 
  to me marxism is stupid , to you that is stupid , and that 's fine . 
  i 'd say marxism , but cool , keep putting words in my mouth . 
  what facts ? 
  that was an opinion . 
  edit : also , do you even know what ' a snowflake ' means ? 
  i see same stupid shit coming from liberals now , calling everyone they do n't like ` triggered ' and a ` snowflake ' . 
  turning that back at everyone because some trolls called you that really shows your merit . 
  yeah , that 's too definitely , but remember how people got outraged when kopacz said that we will be comply to the refugee quotas . 
  then pis came in and said `` nope , fuck that , vote for us and we 'll go against it '' , and bam . 
  i respectfully disagree , but i see your point . 
  so are you suggesting that we should let millions of migrants first , and then we can have worries about it ? 
  the original image is basically from a commie party . 
  big city socialists who have no idea that whole poland is not like warsaw . 
  so ... you are suggesting that we should let million of immigrants first , and then we can get angry about it ? 
  what is prevention ? 
   there is no censorship in western europe this is hilarious coming from a german . 
  right wing parties are collecting voters in millions due to shit immigration policies the left has to offer . 
  that 's basically it , pis started to talk against mass immigration and suddenly they skyrocketed . 
  that 's what people want , a halt on immigration . 
  there 's few reasons . 
  he was the face of civic platform , which is blamed for many things today and tied to some scandals . 
  but most of all , people hate him because he 's merkel 's lapdog and a ` sellout ' . 
  i do n't think there 's any question here . 
  most people i know fucking ** hate ** tusk . 
  are you calling for a foreign intervention ? 
  what the fuck dude . 
  hey man , i 'm just saying what 's true , they get a lot of support . 
  and the court system does need a change , is this a good one ? 
  not necessarily , but some change is needed . 
  it 's overblown tbh , people are acting on this subreddit like it 's the end of the world , but it is n't . 
  ` oh no i feel like we enlightened poles are a dying breed in this catholiphate , everyone in my country is dumb except me ' seriously , i 'm reading these comments and cringing at some comments from polish people . 
  yup , you pretty much summed it up . 
  haha , i 'll remember your comment when they get a majority again in next elections . 
  you guys keep repeating the same stupid shit with ` old religious people ' . 
  all demographics voted for pis in last elections , in fact , young people are even more radically right winged than old people . 
  yes . 
  to be fair , there is a storm of leftist circlejerk going around here , and it 's impossible to send an alternative message without being bombarded , but i talked with some people . 
  some people want those changes to the court system , because the judges are corrupt as hell and act like they 're a different caste . 
  a lot of judges are also politically engaged , while they should n't . 
  i hope that clears some things , because discussion here is impossible . 
  then leave .
