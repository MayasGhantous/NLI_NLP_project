  welp , you could probably say the same about polish ones with addition that we have a dose of blondes . 
  one who comes to my mind , too bad she died 2 years ago :( . 
  most people are pro eu as long as it keeps their retarded laws away from us ( no , snail is not a fish my dear french ! ) . 
  in most cases , foreign capital allows us earn more , but the problem with them is they drain our economy and human supplies , not benefiting to its growth and development . 
  we are `` china '' of eu ( cost wise ) anyway , so it 's nothing new . 
   if you like `` darker '' type of girl - brown eyes nikol stankulova - weather reporter for some reason , i expected something like gypsy type of beauty when you wrote `` darker type of girl '' . 
  she 's damn pretty !, 
  the very first word which comes to my mind seeing her is : hazel nut . 
  in polish `` dudy '' means : [ bagpipes ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/dudy ), 
  it 's not ? 
  i would say it 's not very common name , but still very polish . 
  as far as i remember , we even had a [ queen named like that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kinga_of_poland ) . 
  bullshit , we love eu money . 
  why would you hate the eu money ? 
  do n't forget about coca cola and santa claus for about 1,5 month . 
  funny thing , in my very catholic country it 's considered more pagan than christian . 
   no , i do n't know . 
  why ? 
  it would be read somewhat close to `` nadzikutasz '' in polish . 
  maybe with hungarian pronunciation , but with polish one it sounds like like nagi ( nagy sounds very similar ) kutas = naked dick . 
  do i have to say more :p ? 
   haha , yeah , i know this one !, 
  i meant ciapka . 
  unless you wanted to say it like a small baby , it 's czapka not ciapka . 
  ciapka is more a pattern , especially on animal 's fur . 
  http://sjp.pwn.pl/sjp/ciapka;2448977.html please , do n't kill for correction  _ < . 
  i just remember a road sign with a famous name of some village from hungary : [ nagykutas ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/nagykutas ) . 
  i hope you 're aware how funny it sounds from polish perspective . 
   ciapka i hope it 's not a typo if you know what i mean :p .  while it means shit in polish or a pile of something e.g. 
  too poor to buy original games and getting hardware to play games like witcher 3 is a bitch , so i play mostly hearthstone if anything . 
   and for this reason it is going to be crucial to europe in the next 10-20 years . 
  given there will be some valuable workforce here for those 20 years . 
  unlike people in china , we have free movement within eu and people often emigrate to better places like the uk or germany . 
  english , german ( sounds hard and badass imo ) , czech ( fun factor ) and i have hard time with picking the last two . 
  maybe dutch as it 's kinda similar to german and ... russian ? 
  ukrainian , russian is not so funny from our perspective :( . 
   polish , czech and slovak all sound like child talk to me . 
  it works both ways , trust me :p . 
   3 , polish : i like the way it sounds , and learning it allows me to understand some other slavic languages ( not completely though ) . 
  moreover , learning this language is difficult ( for me ) , learning it is a great challenge -- i like challenges when it comes to learning languages . 
  you best bets are ukrainian , czech and slovak with polish , but imo we are a melting pot sort of . 
  you are probably already aware how many words we have from german , right ? 
  katowice is definitely a good place to start . 
  especially , when you know german at a decent level . 
  \u015al\u0105\u015bk has generally good business ties with our western neighbours . 
  krak\u00f3w on the other hand is more `` multi-culti '' or at least touristy , so outsiders have ease to blend it . 
   i begin my sentences with `` przepraszam pana/pani \u0105 , nie m\u00f3wi\u0119 dobrze po polsku , ale ... '' and then they get that i 'm not polish and therefore most of the people try to speak with me in a `` dumbed down '' simple way . 
  i think you do n't need to say that . 
  it 's quite easy to find it out after 1-2 sentences spoken . 
  as long as we understand you , it can be `` kali je\u015b\u0107 , kali zje\u015b\u0107 ''  . 
   also , my fianc\u00e9e 's brother told me he was looking for work for 6 months it varies greatly on one 's eduction . 
   i 'm trying to blend in and not looking for fellow hungarians or foreigners in my area . 
  i had learned that the best way of learning a language and especially the culture and customs is through the natives . 
  according to wiki , there are around 2000 of you in poland , so chances of finding a fellow magyar is slim here . 
  i literally know 1 half-hungarian , half-german , so i guess you 're safe :p . speaking of cz , sz , rz ... obligatory scene from one our older movies : [ grzegorz brz\u0119czyszczykiewicz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onij9kvd7di ) . 
  and yeas , it 's possible to be named like that :d . 
   i agreed with my fianc\u00e9e on after finishing my studies i would move in with her . 
  i 'm currently looking for work , mostly targeting the international corporations and companies , and translating offices . 
  the feedback is well ... poor , but there are opportunities , got an interview coming up this week and hopefully another one next week . 
  unfortunately , it 's not like my chances would be any better back home . 
  yeah , you have the best shot in those . 
  just checked some offers with hungarian as a skill and some do n't even any particular degree . 
  after all , the language is quite rare skill . 
  i have no idea where do you live atm , but in my city , krak\u00f3w there are quite a lot of companies seeking native speakers for their customer service . 
  poor feedback ... how to put it ... everybody been there , you just need to keep trying . 
  you seem to be very ~ ~ masochistic ~ ~ enthusiastic when it comes to learning polish , so for my money it bodes well for your future work  . 
   even if i do n't understand exactly what someone 's talking about , in 80-90 % of all cases i can guess what they mean by context and ask back to confirm i understood them correctly . 
  that 's impressive as it is . 
  i 've yet to meet a foreigner who speaks fluent polish without an accent and he has n't got polish parents . 
  heck , even a foreigner speaking fluent polish is a rare breed . 
  which is why i asked you : w h y in my first post . 
  the older people do n't speak english , you know 25 years ago russian was more in * fashion * . 
  luckily , it 's no more . 
  i could experience something similar when i was on my vacations near balaton lake . 
  i 've tried to ask for a price of watermelon local vendor and she was just talking to us in german : kuafen sie , kaufen :p . 
  as i expected , it 's very rare to see a german learning polish on their own . 
  both have money , it 's kinda natural , i think ? 
  i have hard time to pick one amongst : new german car / s , a bottle of vodka and a rifle . 
   or nearly everybody uhm ... at least i 'm in elite for once . 
  in polish it means : a loser . 
  just saying . 
  i guess , it 's slightly easier if you come from hungarian level of difficulty  . 
  out of curiosity what do you do ( work ) without at least b2 level of polish ? 
  translator or some client related job in corporation where your languages are huge assets ? 
  [ grandfather from wehrmacht ] ( https://thepatrimony.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/manipulativepairingofphotos_tuskandansdmember.jpg ) bringing this up , lost him presidential election . 
  at least he 's now eu `` president '' . 
   polish so you have one or both polish parents ? 
   basic : polish but why : x ? 
  native : polish kinda fluent : english ( c1 level ) struggling with : german . 
  i got stuck at a2 with it . 
  still no germany with their anthem :p . 
  good for you . 
  so what 's your problem then ? 
  do you think cars are n't stolen here from polish ? 
  they are , but yours are simply newer/more expensive . 
  i wonder how would it look like if we had comparable purchasing power . 
  i wonder what your grandparents were doing between 1939-1945 hmmmm ... 
  obama , is that you ? 
  i would say drugs , gays , bikes , windmills and tulips . 
  i think mostly about death-related ones .
