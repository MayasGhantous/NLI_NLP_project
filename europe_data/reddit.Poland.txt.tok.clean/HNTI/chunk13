  ( politics , sports , whatever ) one country tried to pull off something like that . 
  it ended up with ussr ( ~ ~ slavs & friends ~ ~ russia & slaves ), 
  croatian cura ( girlfriend ) = c\u00f3ra ( daughter ) polish , \u00f3 & u is the same shit in polish , we just like to complicate our lives djevojka sounds less incestuous :p . 
  cz potraviny ( ~ convenience shop ) = something after digesting , gives me an image of vomit pl , cz zach\u00f3d ( wc ) = zach\u00f3d ( west ) pl , so id\u0119 na zach\u00f3d sounds kinda interesting ... 
  russia and why ? 
  it 's complicated and one word : putin . 
  russia , is that you ? 
  i would expect some other country , rather from ussr block that japan . 
  at least i do n't think it 's a mutual feeling , like it 's between germany and japan . 
   i think the amount downvotes are is `` normal '' for ~ ~ some parts of ~ ~ reddit ftfy, 
  you clearly lack an option : believing , but not practising ( attending church ) . 
  from german ones : rampage . 
  it 's not great , but good imo.o was surprised yhat such brutal movie was allewed to be produced n germany . 
  i wonder how the others in v4 feel about it . 
  i 'll give you answer after 2020 when flow of eu cash will cease . 
  atm i feel like the 2nd category of eu citizen . 
  i 'm reminded about this every time , i want to buy something in usd or euro : / . 
  polish first , eu second . 
  you reminded me this comic : [ yay , deutschland ] ( http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aew37mp_700b_v1.jpg ), 
   honestly it does n't have to be cheaper if you can earn a lot more money if you pay less to your ~ ~ slaves ~ ~ workers e.g. 
  2000 pln instead of 2000 euro , you save like 75 % . 
  i was mostly referring to the case of amazon moving their centres from germany to poland , guess why  ? 
  well , looking too long in one 's eyes , in my book , can mean 2 things : a ) confrontation b ) some `` weird '' context , is he gay or something ? 
  i do n't mind keeping eye contact with beautiful girls through ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  20 mbps down and 1 mbps up for 20 euro , combined with phone and tv ( 80 channels ) . orange cables suck in my block of flats . 
  i find it quite fascinating that my country which hitler wanted to destroy is way closer to his vision of pure race ( 96 % people here are white , polish and often catholics ) than germany right now . 
  i can bet he 's turning in his grave , `` seeing '' modern germany . 
   democracy deutsche bahn/lufthansa striking again ? 
   humanism , freedom so more multi-culti refugees ? 
   equality love parade ? 
  on side note , i always wanted what german history books say about time 39-45 , i mean your version of history as often these less favourable parts `` vanish '' from books , but in this case , i guess it 's quite hard to do so . 
  well , he just wanted more life space for you ... / s, 
  i speak polish and english ... as for wishes , german sounds evil/badass and it 's difficult to learn . 
  some day i would finish my triad with japanese ( my inner nerd howls ) , but not before mastering german what may take a few reincarnations . 
  plz , no - i 've seen some scala and it 's already scary to think what lays ahead of me in that book i read . 
  work in it , but not for this salary ... 
  even polish plumber : < ? 
   become ~ ~ more economically interessting ~ ~ cheaper ftfy, 
  at least he has a fancy haircut . 
  our salaries compared to the west . 
  literally , potatoland . 
   in the balkans most of the cities are relatively dirty . 
  this is based on ? 
  so , do you imply that these armies of layers , doctors and engineers from middle east stick their dicks in females without authorisation ? 
  you have the colonial past and shiton of multi-culti - we do n't  . 
  so the same goes for black skin ? 
  no wonder pc is considered retarded here . 
  so calling a native british white is racist as well ? 
  you and your political correctness  _  . 
  ok , my bad . 
  i just remember that hungary has huge regret after losing 2/3 territory , but i 'm not sure who you blame it for . 
  well , not that it 's a bad thing . 
  tiny/baby things are cute / ~ ~ kawaii ~ ~ / very likeable ( as in your picture ) :d, 
  fair enough , but i beg to differ . 
  well , but in that independent state you 're missing like 2/3 of your original area ? 
  you did n't mention anything polish ** shifty eyes **, 
  mostly russians , germans and ... jews ? 
  [ 90s years ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_diwugbna ), 
  despite of my pessimism , i 'm a quiet fan of their attitude to life : yes we can !, 
  and fighting against all odds . 
  i wish i were like that . 
  higher it salaries and lower taxes ( i know it 's a trade-off for less public services or healthcare ) ? 
  i 'm torn apart between japan and the usa : /, 
  sips * boston * tea, 
  we love you in eu , but i get an impression it 's unrequited feeling :( . 
  so you still love them after the split ? 
  give up that idea ( and anything else ), 
  polish english terrible german - a1-a2 level , this shit is spine breaking : <, 
   poland - i 've got the feeling that the negative stereotypes have somewhat shifted towards other nationalities , which indicates that poland is becoming more and more liked . 
  from what i 've heard , poland is doing very well economically , which is nice of them . 
  all the poles i 've ever met were really nice and upright people , so i think highly of poland . 
  i 'm just unsure what to think of the strong role of catholicism and pis . 
  from my perspective all negativity comes from our `` difficult '' history . 
  i would say we do so-so economically , it 's slowly getting better and better , but i look forward to the moment of truth around 2020 when eu founds will be ceased . 
  then we going to know how prosperous we are . 
  with our low level innovation/industry , i do n't bode it too well . 
  take catholicism with a pinch of salt , at least in bigger cities and pis is lesser evil . 
   i 've met few russians and i ca n't say anything bad about them . 
  from our side , you language sounds like baby talk , sort of  . 
  it 's true and what 's more funny another word s\u0142owianie ( slavs ) comes from a root word : s\u0142owo ( a word ) , so logic behind this is slavs = those who can speak . 
  politically maybe , but geographically - not really . 
  or you work for polish ~ ~ company ~ ~ corporation known of depending on student workforce . 
  mostly german ones as i miserably try to learn it ( one day , one day !! ), 
  : - rammstein - cro - sido and stuff like this :p [ ballerman hits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwepx-cpos4 ) ( found that one due to her other `` clips '' ) . 
  i often pick just single songs heard in radio as it 's not my style to follow any artist . 
   you forgot ~ ~ sausages ~ ~ wurst . 
  ftfy, 
  i think , i prefer bannerman hits over this  _  . 
   french is always beautiful . 
      french flair     adds up humble brag . 
  my 2 ( euro ) cents : [ anthem of europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) of course yours is way more popular , but this one is quite recognised - at least in eu , i think . 
   but it might end up a bit half-assed it 's not just a thing in your country . 
  here you also need to supervise them to not botch your house :p . 
   right-wing and homogeneous like ireland was 15-20 years ago or more . 
  not that it 's a bad thing if you see what happens in `` developed '' west ( multi-culti ) . 
   for germans , we are fascinated by it . 
  we want to ~ ~ explore ~ ~ conquer it all !, 
  ftfy, 
   have no intention to stay in hungary or poland etc exactly this . 
  they want to go to the same countries where we go to look for better life and work : the gb , germany , france , netherlands and the northern eu .
