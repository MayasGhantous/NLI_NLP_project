  we have one common [ `` enemy '' ] ( http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/world-without-russia-world-without-problems.jpg ) . 
  it would be easier to get new anime/manga :  . 
  there are 2 levels : official : maintaining `` normal '' relationship , the same with germany , but now they are tamed by the usa sort of ( little army , no nukes and your bases ) , thus germany is now more predictable unofficial : tourists with cash are ok ( like it 's something new , huh ? ), 
  and with a few shots of vodka we can even find some common language i would say there 's no general hostility towards them as it is , but ( almost ) everybody knows that the problem is on higher political level of their crushed ambitions of empire and an average ivanov does n't do any harm to us . 
  we need more of them here , cuz [ put.in ] ( http://i1.kwejk.pl/k/obrazki/2014/03/4079fcd092b2ea35dd23092ec7812275_original.jpg ) . 
  apart from that , we were , we are and most likely will be on the usa 's side as in world of 2 supoerpowers you can be with russia or the usa . 
  the choice is rather simple . 
  it 's a national holiday till this day . 
  966 - baptism of poland 1410 - battle of grunwald 1791 - constitution of may 3 , 1791 1918 - regaining independence after 123 years, 
  and why should n't we ? 
  i do n't think about any country having a reason to not like you except russia ( the north pole and oil ) , but it 's nothing new . 
  your culture seems to be overshadowed by the usa . 
  personally , i hate that you need french in addition to english to communicate in some cities . 
  it 's not strange - usa , the first world superpower - uses it and it 's good to be on good terms with them or make some business . 
  they invented quite some amount of technology like the internet which is often documented in ... yes , english ( surprise , huh ? ) . 
  besides , we have the gb and its former colonies . 
  i think it has to do more with so-called soft power than anything else . 
  in medieval we used latin as catholic church was very inflective , later french ( still it 's quite used in diplomacy ) and now english . 
  life is easier in such scrambled place as europe with one ( more or less ) common language . 
  also without english you have very limited path of career = less money . 
  you know there 's such a thing as variety in eu . 
  you stood against russians , so you 're european for us  . 
  also this : [ water ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandia_%28vodka%29 ), 
  `` great britain does not have friends , only interest '' . 
  it 's not that we can force them to stay , it 's up to them after all . 
  also with fuckton of immigrants in eu , every country tries to secure their goals what in most cases means : go be immigrant elsewhere . 
  they are oddballs , but they are our european oddballs . 
   what ? 
  sorry , we were playing video games . 
  found a party for me !, 
  sld : old commies & lgbt, 
  - 8:00 -9:00 - taking my `` corpse from bed '' , hard to name it as waking up , breakfast , cleaning etc. 
  - + / -9:00 - commuting which takes exactly 1 hour , train - 10-18 - work aka hypnotizing my 2 monitors for 8 hours with not-paid , enforced on us , break for a dinner ( 30 min . ), 
  - 19 - 21 , monday or wednesday - i attend german classes , i fail at it really hard , the 3rd attempt to learn it , still no success to get higher than a2 ;( , in wednesdays and thursdays i go to our swimming pool , one of very few perks in our company - free swimming pool with bazillion of workers swarming it - 21:30 - home , bath , supper , internet ( e-mails , some reddit etc. 
  ) , sleep and repeat the routine 5 times a week i fricking hate waking up before 10 a.m. ... that 's middle of the night , so as not so hard to guess , i 'm pissed most of the time from monday till friday . 
  bonus points for being pedantic with minutes . 
  i could n't follow such schedule and even with flexible working hours i struggle with sufficient amount of sleep ( 8 hours is not enough for me  _ < , also it job ) . 
  at least you 're paid well contrary to me -_- . 
  as the rest of peeps here : never heard of it . 
  at least it has no scat :p . 
  a good reason to pick career as a judge . 
  got ta love that foreplay . 
  well , there 's definitely a thing with german porn ( no dialogues , just ja , ja and oh main gott thrown every now and then ) , but scat : f ? 
  op plz ... anyway pis  po , so far . 
  it 's cheaper and usually better quality than ordered food . 
  let it stay that way , at least officially . 
  [ religion in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe#/media/file:europe_belief_in_god.svg ) at least something we are good at ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  at least they do n't plan to blow us up . 
  i 'll blindly take rydzyk + mohers in instead of `` multi-culti '' enrichment . 
  at least it 's known , our `` enemy '' . 
  if she really plans to get german citizenship , she should start learning german asap . 
  and this :  the spouse of a german citizen may be naturalised after 3 years of continual residency in germany . 
  the marriage must have persisted for at least 2 years . 
  given you are eligible to get german citizenship ( one parent is german ) and can sponsor hers . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nationality_law#naturalisation_as_a_german_citizen, 
  what about this part :  dual citizenship allowed under following circumstances : 1 . 
  if the other citizenship is the one of another eu country or of switzerland . 
  if a child born to german parents acquires another citizenship  at birth ( e.g. , based on place of birth [ birth in a jus-soli country such as canada or the united states of america ] , or descent  from one parent [ one german parent and one foreign parent ] ) . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nationality_law my only fear is the uk plans to leave eu if something goes wrong with referendum , so ... things might get complicated . 
  i do n't think you can see many creatures like that in the wild . 
  if so , it works the other way round ... a pole speaking german . 
  i would say we had problems mostly with russians and germans . 
  well , i 'm not an expert in us candies except these globally known . 
  well , i approached to it more like something new and exciting ... after all it 's not a well known brand here . 
  and learn about democracy and freedom / s, 
  as murrayhenson said when it comes to krak\u00f3w : + english will do when it comes to everyday life in the city + it 's still relatively cheap for foreigners + rich social & night life ( with places like [ zakopane ] ( http://zakopane.fr.pl/img/bg.jpg ) or [ wieliczka ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/62/64/41/wieliczka.jpg ) nearby ) + should be easy to meet new friends at uni + safe ( when you take into consideration western eu an crisis ) - outside the city , you can encounter problems with just english ( especially with elder people ) , do n't count on german , let alone french other notes : small + for being american , but do n't boast to much with your german half . 
  some people like to recall ww2 and so on , without any reason ( do n't ask me why - it simply can just cause problems ) . 
  source : citizen born and still living in the city, 
  russia in conflict with ukraine and our western neighbour aka germany which also caused us some problems in the past ... they behave kinda abnormally recently , let alone refugees quota distribution . 
  and unstable germany does n't bode well for the whole europe . 
  in poland , there are quite popular jokes about pole , russian and german ( polak , rusek & niemiec ) , our 2 fav . 
  nations , guess why :p . example : the devil caught a pole , russian and german and told them to bring a best vehicle their nation produced and then he . 
  first comes a pole with fiat and the devil says : now your destroy it with a wrench . 
  as fiat was n't very durable it was quick . 
  then it was german 's turn , he came with mercedes . 
  the devil gave him the same task . 
  it took him significantly more time as it was solid german construction . 
  after destroying the car they wait for the russian . 
  they wait , they wait ... times passes by , but there 's no sign of him . 
  suddenly pole and german notice a small point on the horizon and burst with laugher . 
  the devil asks them : why do you laugh so loud ? 
  they replay him : the russian comes in a tank . 
  honourable mention to jokes about jews . 
  and the eastern europe thinks the western one is spoiled and rotten by money ... 
  about poland , all true except the first one . 
  now eu gives money ^ ^ . 
  still lost to poland in eu 2016 eliminations 2:0 . 
  champions pfff :p . 
  to be honest , i heard more about his father than about him - tea party . 
  as for the kaisch , there 's not much info about him here in media.he seems to be a good surgeon , but i 'm notcsure if it 's a good material for a polititian . 
  all i see in the net is trump , cruz and till recently rubio in the race for delegates . 
  as for me : democratic party = socialists , promising wonders such as obamacare republicans = conservative nationalists , a bit retarded at times read trump , but from my point of view still better than democrats ( no visas for poles my ass , thanks obama ), 
  pearl harbor ... as much as i sympathise with japan , it was cold calculation from american side . 
  nuke these cities or sacrifice thousands of beings on their side . 
  the choice was simple . 
  as my hungarian poster said , restaurants are considered rather expensive places ( for occasions like salary increase celebration or one 's birthday ) and drinking only tap water looks kinda cheap or at least does n't generate them income as sold bottle of water . 
  after all , they want you to leave there a good amount of your money , right ? 
  it 's not that they will deny your request if you put some normal order , but it 's more unusual than usual request if you asked me . 
  ` you can replace every specialist with a finite number of students ' ( in most cases with just one one ) and yeah , your guess is correct, 
  i guess i mostly recognise americans if they are : a ) loud , it 's especially infuriating in buses or trains , normally i do n't care much b ) omnipresent aura of '' ~ ~ ass ~ ~ yes we can '' embodied by the amount of : ok , yeah , sure i hear from them but other than that , it 's hard to tell them apart .
