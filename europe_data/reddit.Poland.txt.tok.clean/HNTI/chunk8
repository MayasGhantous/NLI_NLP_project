  pronounciation is a moderate issue imo . 
  [ warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) not the brightest card of our history . 
  not weird ... just without dialogues . 
  just straight to the point . 
  said `` colourful '' france ... 
  nobody wants extremists , but it 's a mixed bag and if 1-2 muslims would have a worse day and decide to `` unite '' with the god , there 's not much you can do about it . 
  so far multi-culti blows , at times litetally . 
  i would support such ban . 
  i 'm curious how it will go in the usa . 
  maybe sense of unity ? 
  recently , we are quite economical with that in eu . 
  never heard it .

  i had english course at uni , but it was rather walk in the park ( only polish teacher ) , compared to private classes i had . 
  most people , including me , attendef courses outside schools/unis if they really wanted to learn english . 
  two schools i could recommend : http://www.lincoln.edu.pl/ http://www.lingualand.pl/ you can check as well the british council site in cracow . 
  their courses are more elitist/expensive/more consistent https://www.britishcouncil.pl/angielski/szkoly-angielskiego/krakow uni in cracow , but no idea if they hiring atm : http://www.ifa.filg.uj.edu.pl/en_gb/ as i said i just had one american teacher ( not at uni ) , but in europe you are the rare breed as we have the uk closer . 
  out of curiosity , what makes the difference in teaching at uni and in private courses ? 
  i think we prefer to stay alive . 
  reviving nation every time is quite resource-hungry . 
  not that i deny that given that it 's used as a vulgar way of expressing anger or excitement as `` o kurwa ! '', 
  with some variations . 
  and playing games is quite full of emotions ( mostly negative ) . 
  kurwa - a whore/prostitute , but also can be used to express anger or excitement , some use it instead comas or full stops / s pizda/cipa - a pussy , so genitals chuj/kutas - a dick pierdoli\u0107 - to fuck , deriving words are zapierdol\u0107 ( to steal ) , upierdoli\u0107 , dopierdoli\u0107 , przypierdoli\u0107 , opierdoli\u0107 , odpierdoli\u0107 , wpierdoli\u0107 etc. , they are considered rather vulgar wali\u0107 - ~ to bang jeba\u0107 - ~ to fuck skurwysyn - son of a bitch ( literally ) most of them revolve around genitals . 
  good for christian nation , right ;d ? 
  most of my natives teaching me were english , but i had one american one ... and i recall him for overusing words like cool and ok , even if that was awkward af . 
  as far as i 'm aware the fast you 're american is n't a problem as long as your students stick to ame what might be somewhat challenging given how long it takes to learn be it british english or any other dialect . 
  i mean students usually have more than 1 teacher during their progress . 
  mixing dialects is a huge no-no on exams . 
  personally , i find it interesting to have a non-british english native speaker as a teacher as it challenges your comprehending skills . 
  nope . 
  we just get rid of the last left-wing party from our parliament . 
  i see nothing wrong with removing from public eye people who sold national property for peanuts , let alone stealing it . 
  i 'm not very happy with our right-wing ruling party , but it 's lesser of two evils . 
  also , more modern left-wing parties have no ground here with pro-homo/drugs slogans . 
  they tried and failed miserably . 
  well as far as i remember , pegasus ( known elsewhere as famicom/nes ) was a thing . 
  and consoles are still expensive .

  as far as i 'm aware kurwa word is quite universally used across all slavic languages ... 
   in poland , abortion is banned except in the following three circumstances . 
    * when the woman 's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy ,  * when the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act , or  * when the fetus is seriously malformed   unlike in other countries where abortion is banned , women in poland are not subject to a penalty for illegal termination of pregnancy . 
  consent of a physician is required for circumstances ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) above , while abortions in view of circumstance ( 2 ) above must be certified by prosecutor . 
  parental consent is always required if the woman seeking abortion is a minor . 
   in addition , persuading a woman to carry out illegal termination of her pregnancy is a criminal act . 
  the following governments wanted to improve it , but so far it 's the best consensus we got and people are rather ok with it , given how much influence catholic church has here . 
  imo abortion should n't be easily available as a plan b if you forget to use a condom or even the morning after pill . 
  if you are irresponsible then maybe sex is n't for you . 
  still better than \u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u043b\u044f\u0442 players :p .

   or spanish , or in any language it is pol\u00f2nia or similar not in hungarian :p . 
   i can somewhat understand your language . 
  and both sides have quite a lot of fun understanding each other :d .  it 's interesting that after 89 you moved towards religion as far as i 'm aware it was always a thing before 89 due to ussr occupation and church was the biggest ally during that hard times . 
  only recently , things slowly change as catholic church is n't as needed and there were quite a few scandals undermining this authority . 
   crazy language when it is written . 
  ** looks at posters flair ** it works both ways ... trust me , but i have to admit , german pronunciation is easier , however grammar uhhhh ... 
   but i heard the quality is much better in poland , so maybe you are just exporting crap and leave the good stuff for yourselves . 
  lol no , they transport it to the countries which pay better in euros . 
  but seriously , not processed stuff like fruits or veggies are mostly good quality . 
   my polish friends tell me the poles like to keep the good stuff for their internal market and export junk . 
  well done , poles !, 
  well there 's some logic in it , given our experiences with germany and the same brand products usually being better quality than produced here ( palm oil instead of butter in cookies or stronger/more efficient washing powders ) . 
  vodka , polar bears at streets and fbi secret prisons . 
  for now my country is very pro-eu , bar taking immigrants . 
  i 'll have an opinon after 2020 . 
   14:40 p.m. 
  i think hours do n't work in that way in english , sir  . 
  using english makes looking for help easier as keywords or terms give more hits in google . 
  other than that , i do n't mind good polish versions . 
  go ask him then if you 're sooooo curious ... 
  he may even give you an answer . 
  one thing which caught my attention is that polish wiki pages quite often take a notice who had jewish ancestors and who not .

  have like 3 months time of watching anime with english subtitles and series like south park or it crowd to get use to ` fancy accent ' . 
  most of my books/manuals are in english anyway . 
  being able to afford life standard similar to the one on the west . 
  what currently makes me feel very non-european . 
  poland wo n't be in monetary union long , very long ... trust me , nobody is interested in it atm here . 
  not with this purchasing power . 
  thanks !, 
  not that we have any better word for that . 
  my fav . 
  example of localisation of english term was interface -  mi\u0119dzymordzie ( literally !, 
  sounds stupid and these days it 's used as a joke in it . 
  they are available here under name precel , but not very common/popular , i think . 
  at very least not as in dach countries . 
  i need more such videos in my life . 
  manual , not that i have a choice . 
  english . 
  why ? 
  1 ) old habits , die hard . 
  2 ) it never hurts to learn/practise it a bit more . 
  after all it 's more useful than polish business-wise . 
  3 ) in most cases , english versions are solid quality compared to polish ones .
