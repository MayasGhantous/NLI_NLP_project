  szlafrok - comes from german schlafrock and means pyjamas/nightgown . 
  as far as i 'm aware this word in german is considered archaic whereas in polish is still in use . 
  drukarka - meaning in polish ' a printer ' and comes from german drucken - compress , put pressure and it refers to very first method of printing books . 
  ratusz - means a town hall and comes from german das rathaus . 
  bohater - a hero in polish , it has hungarian ( b\u00e1tor ) or iranian ( bahadur ) origin according to polish wiki . 
  talk to the hand . 
   ok , now you are mixing up your two different racist stereotypes . 
  if people come to live off welfare , they wo n't go amok and kill lots of people . 
  if people are sneaking in to carry out an attack , they wo n't really care so much about the welfare system , they will go to the place they hate the most . 
  you do n't need welfare money when you can get those 72 virgins . 
  obviously isis hates germany for accepting refugees . 
  it goes against their ideology . 
  they have no real reason i can think of why they would hate poland though . 
  isis does ? 
  that 's some news to me . 
  and how do you know it ? 
  all i see is a terrorist attack in one of ` open-minded ' countries every now and then . 
  if you , as a rich country with more people , ca n't handle who gets on your teritory then do n't expect lesser nations to support your idea of blindly taking immigrants as you try to enforce on v4 via eu . 
   not sure if you 're trying to threaten me ... by you i meant as a nation , not you as a person . 
  i was n't clear enough . 
  hmmm interesting that you know what i read or watch ... really ? 
  if you seek shelter from war , then you are willing to give up on everything you had and not cherry-picking places like they do right now going mostly to the countries with the best social : germany , sweden . 
  france or the uk . 
  we do have muslim minority : tatars , but they integrated somehow into our society over time . 
  say whatever you want , but it 's you who gon na pay with blood for your tolerance . 
   native-sounding accent it always makes me wonder how you can guess it accurately , given you have many dialects : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_dialects_of_the_english_language is it more about coherency in the way they talk or what ? 
   hungarian is hard to learn and hard to teach , but not impossible . 
   so do polish :p . 
  less mutli-culti and more responsible politics . 
  why told you need to absorb all those waves ? 
  hint : germany gets these attacks whereas we do n't or we have better intelligence what i doubt . 
  i have just one wish apart from eu still existing : cutting uncontrolled flow of immigrants . 
  looking at you germany . 
  on top of my head the most : russia ( at least partly it 's europe ) or france the least : finland maybe ? 
  i do n't hear much about them making fuss within eu , so no news is a good news . 
  it 's huge , but it has a population more or less of my country ... 
   is there anything else bad about canada ? 
  some of them speak french ... * points at you flair *, 
  i think we `` never admit defeat '' : - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_air_forces_in_france_and_great_britain - be it an example from our history 123 years of being wiped out from the map of europe or something more plain like this : https://eastpennfoot.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/sochi-olympics-justyna-kowalczyk-broken-foot/ ( she 's very popular here in poland ) i think , it 's a trait you must have if you 're in a `` wonderful '' geopolitical location between germany and russia . 
  no idea if there 's a single word for this in english through . 
  just wait till eu monies will stop flowing ... polish migrants vol . 
  2 - coming soon , only in the best eu countries !, 
   alongside that , probably eastern european countries like poland which have completely transformed since the fall of communism . 
  funny as we still feel like a shit when you check amazon or ebay and you can literally buy very little for salary in pln . 
  sure everything looks nicer and fancier ( public infrastructure ) , but unless your life aspiration end on cheap food & internet/mobile services everything else is rather on expensive side . 
  all that comes to my mind on this topic are stereotypes of outsourced programmers , speaking special only known to them english . 
  english , a bit of german ( this will be my life time goal , i guess , failed 3 times already to go above a2 : / , currently i dropped learning it as i do n't feel like learning anything right now ) , java & c++ . 
  gwent shadow tactics : blades of the shogun ( basically commandos in medieval japan ) shadow warrior 2 sniper : ghost warrior superhot dying light dead island hatred earth 2140/50/60 series and something very ancient polanie :d ( called polish warcraft ), 
  definitely japan . 
   poland declared war on somebody only once in the entire 20th century . 
  it was on japan , as a result of the japanese attack on pearl harbor and the following british declaration of war . 
  prime minister hideki t\u014dj\u014d 's answer was following : `` we do n't accept the polish declaration of war . 
  the poles , fighting for their freedom , declared war under the british pressure '' .

  well , yeah ... but still i think that most of western europe see us otherwise -_- . 
   orehnja\u010da / makovnja\u010da looks like our makowiec ( recipe in english ) : http://magdascauldron.com/2014/01/poppy-seed-roll-makowiec.html, 
  well , how to put it ... if you manage to learn polish to a decent level , i 'll tip a hat to you . 
  as for advices : - do n't get discouraged , but if kids are able to manage to learn it then so you are !, 
  - we have kinda fucked up orography ( who needs \u017c / rz , u / \u00f3 ? 
  ) , but it 's just a matter of repeating exercises and there are a few rules helping with it - complex grammar is a trade off for lack of articles and you have very flexible word order unlike in german e.g. 
  it makes you more likely to be understood , even if something goes wrong with grammar . 
   compound words funny thing , but i find it more a folklore thing than annoyance . 
  i just wonder how do you manage to write a a number of money on check if it 's a huge number ? 
  as someone who failed 3 times learning german , i find the articles as my nemesis of mastering german language . 
  i guess , english spoiled me on that matter . 
  ireland was also popular among corporations due to this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement, 
   i 'm sad that i have n't been to eastern europe yet !, 
  do n't you already have enough of eastern europe on isles ;p ? 
  ( points at my own flair ), 
  most favorite : hungary the lest favorite : greece ( too loud , annoying night life ) apart from these two , i was in croatia and bulgaria . 
  in polish , `` no '' might mean `` yes '' . 
  last time i checked , german works in similar fashion es ist and es ist nicht . 
  in polish we have something similar when it comes to origin of the word , but it generally refers to a thing we do n't know name of : wihajster ( comes from wie hei\u00dft er ? 
  - what 's his name ) ? 
  i kinda do n't understand prices for goods in us shops . 
  why tags have just a price without sales tax ? 
  does it change so often or what ? 
  in eu , it 's perfectly clear how much money you need to get a product you want , but in the usa ? 
  especially , if sales tax varies from state to state . 
  we were/are and probably will be screwed by our geopolitical location between germany and russia . 
   `` polish chicks are hot meit '' this is getting old ... and take the fuck all of them from here . 
  not that i ever wanted to have one or something . 
  uhm , that explains it , i guess . 
  thanks . 
  may i ask : how the heck you know he amount of money you need to take to a shop to buy x item if a price on item excludes tax ? 
  calculate it manually every damn time ? 
  i think , i 'm missing something here . 
  it 's not popular here . 
  you need to exchange it to some real currency like usd to have some use out of bitcoins . 
  yeah , seen it too many times ... and given my porn hobby , it does n't phase me . 
  i 've been in bulgaria once and did n't notice much difference in appearance . 
  i guess , an average bulgarian guy is still more handsome than an average polish guy . 
  one of many sources : http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/poorest-list/8-ugliest-nationalities-in-the-beautifulpeople-world/, 
  yeah , but we have them less than let 's say dutch or germans . 
   also , even the eu president is polish . 
  just wait when ends being president and will come back to poland , hue hue hue . 
   for example , you 're not eastern europe : you 're central . 
  tell it to western europeans , i know it well , but most of people probably think central europe : germany - rich and poland in comparison ... is quite poor ( 4 times lower purchasing power ) . 
  slightly exotic for me , but indeed very beautiful . 
   but the bulgarian girls themselves are very different , some are whiter , some are darker .
