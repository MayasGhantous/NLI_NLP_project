which country will act ftfy, 
  na wilno !, 
  you know , baiting is much more effective when you have a normal nick . 
  like nacjonalista69 or something . 
  not like `` hatemefaggots '' . 
  this translates into something like this : `` the symbolism of grave candles we light is a bit different . 
  custom of starting a fire on graves originates from pagan tradition - * dziady * , that is the summoning of dead and meeting their bodily needs . 
  during * dziady * , people used to put food , that the dead were supposed to eat , on the graves . 
  fire lit then was on the other hand supposed to scare off wights and vampires ( there is no translation for their `` earlier version '' in our culture , even wikipedia uses `` vampire '' . 
  * upi\u00f3r * is more of a general word for scary undead folks or something like this , while * wampir * is a vampire nowadays ) , and show our dead the way home and afterwards - to the netherworld . 
  it was also believed that souls warmed themselves by the fire lit for them . '', 
  jeez , translating culture stuff is hard , so sorry if i messed something up . 
  the author of article also used some constructions that have no equivalents in english ( or i 'm just too stupid to know them ) . 
  if you want to know more , google up things like * zaduszki * or * dziady * . 
  why is the `` gender equality '' seat always taken by female ? 
  that 's just sexist . 
  no , they are not . 
  this just just an adopted version of reaaally old slavic tradition , afaik . 
  so they took our candles that were supposed to keep souls warm and used them to replace your eggs . 
  but do n't go for just few days , it 's not enough !, 
  at least a week is needed to consider your trip complete . 
  try to do the same to * palace of culture and science * or anything else and let 's see . 
  `` these missiles ? 
  anybody could order them online . '', 
  there is difference between attacking others based on stereotypes and joking based on stereotypes . 
  some just do n't see it ( and either consider everything to be jokes , or assume everything 's offensive ) . 
  stereotypes of canadians and asians are ignored , because they are mainly positive . 
  i feel like this is what causes this double standard . 
  ^ ^ also ^ ^ us ^ ^ is ^ ^ full ^ ^ of ^ ^ absurdities . 
  still no such thing here ( thanks god ) . 
  i 've heard the door bell only once today < 3, 
   hungarian parliament building ^ this, 
  well , if jews migrated , maybe we would have several thousands deaths less ... 
  * i thought we 'd be last . 
  ^ right ^ before ^ romania ^ and ^ bulgaria . 
  shhh , i gave you 0.25 . :(, 
  we almost had madagascar , so it should be 0.25 . 
  between 1639-1693 tobago belonged to duchy of courland and semigallia , which was a vassal state of pl-l commonwealth , so we should add 0.25 ( and another 0.25 to lithuania ) . 
  we already have 0.5 colony . 
  plox halp and maybe we 'll become a colonial empire . 
  :d and then we stronk !, 
  i do n't like this design at all , but thanks for sharing . 
  i think i 'll visit it in spring , as soon as it gets at least a bit sunny and warm . 
  this is how i imagine people who post stuff like this . 
  i have n't heard of that . 
  i need to talk to my grandparents !, 
  where can i read more about this ? 
  i have n't seen any of them . 
  there is clearly something wrong with me ... or society . 
   poland - # 249m give less , take more . 
  that 's what we like . 
   and it 's spelled lw\u00f3w it 's spelled lviv as well . 
  i think we may need `` ama , i 'm belorussian '' thread . 
  guys , how can you accept stuff like this ? 
  ~ ~ [ sorry , i had to ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uogjv9l.png ) ~ ~ edit : i actually could n't , so i striked it . 
  please do n't tell reddit police it was me who shared it . 
  and please do n't use it ^ i ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ live . 
  hint : $ $ $, 
  so we are back to calling each other nazis and murderers ... 
  that map with beating is worrying , but these were all * kibole * and far-right . 
  they beat all the people if they disagree . 
  he worded it poorly , but traditional family is coded in our minds as deep as bugs on riot 's servers . 
  during different kinds of occupations ( and we know like almost all of them ) , the two only things that were untouchable by `` regimes '' were family and religion - very personal things . 
  the church thing altered our nationality - it took some of our identity , almost-oppressed non-catholic poles , but long story short it kept us fighting . 
  while there were no possibilities to associate in or form any movements , unions or whatevers , family on the other hand persisted . 
  there was always somebody to aid you . 
  there was always somebody you could talk to , even about thing unspeakable in public . 
  that being said , i support gay people . 
  i have nothing against them ^ unless ^ they ^ act ^ like ^ feminists . 
  i support them in their fight for easier love . 
  i am okay with civil unions for them . 
  i am okay even with almost-marriages for them ( we just need to name it the way that wo n't confuse ) . 
  but that 's all . 
  only on croatian-hungarian board , sorry . 
  even our language is against , as it suggests there is one woman in a '' * ma\u0142\u017ce\u0144stwo * '' . 
  maybe not partition , but * liberate * . 
  starting with kaliningrad oblast as * it had always been * either polish ( polish-lithuanian ) or german . 
  i 'm curious what would happen if western countries actually started to use putin 's quotes against him . 
  which is like 60-110 % of our population . 
  this is why they got rid of him in sweden . 
  i want to see this happen . 
  so bad . 
  unless it turns out not-so-good . 
  they are so stealthy that no pole has seen them . 
  every kowalski , smith and miller will read whole agreement . 
  definitely . 
  but will there still be uk ? 
  or . . just k ? 
  yay , my grandchildren will live in a rich country !, 
  seriously , what do stereotypical poles drink these days ? 
  we make up for this suprising loss by drinking lots of vodka . 
  me neither !, 
  luckily my father did n't know this , too . 
  i 'd be jakub : s, 
  west slavs really like jakub . 
  while i understand harry and lily are popular in uk , why is jakub so popular here ? 
  poles are too lazy to do something twice !, 
  it 's good they did a commercial !, 
  nobody would use it otherwise !, 
  yay for canada !,
