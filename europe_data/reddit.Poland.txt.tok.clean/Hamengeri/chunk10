  so it 's happening ... 
   would you say the justice system in poland is good ? 
  no , it punishes instead of helping . 
  just like all other i 've heard of ... 
  well , big part of our `` fresh '' diaspora ( first generation ) is ... pitiful . 
  they are the ones who ca n't speak foreign languages at all . 
  ones , who fit `` eastern european style '' meme . 
  ones , who run away from their past filled with failures . 
  i hate them , to be honest . 
  they make me feel ashamed sometimes . 
  other part are people of success , who simply decide to move for some reason . 
  most of them are young marriages - they could be happy anywhere . 
  they plan their future . 
  it 's sad to see them go , but the image of `` average pole '' benefits from their migration . 
  there are also second - third - etc - generation emigrants . 
  it 's often hard to disguise them , which is nice . 
  it means that they fit in society they moved to . 
  yes , i have relatives from each category ... 
  our tv series are quite good but they are too long in most cases . 
  too many advertisments . 
  we only produce movies with history in background and romantic comedies with lots of * sucharki * ( sucharek is a colloquial way of saying `` joke that is at least as pitiable as funny '' ) . 
  the only exception i remember was [ sala samob\u00f3jc\u00f3w ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_room ) . 
  our `` x factors and company '' are comparable to these in us - the only difference is that audience is not as emotional ( thank you god ) and participants do n't think in imperialistic ways ( every other participant in american x factor `` came here to win '' , `` to show america and whole world a true talent '' ) . 
  we have some good channels , we have some interviews with stars from us etc , but sometimes there 's simply nothing to watch . 
  landscapes : every part of poland has something worth seeing , if i said '' * g\u00f3ry sto\u0142owe * is the most beautiful place on earth '' , i would get punched in the face by a random fan of * mazury * . 
  women : just check survey results . 
  politics : i have nothing to say . 
  no comments . 
  this kind of democracy just has no chance of success in this country . 
  history : personally , i love it . 
  it 's like from a fantasy book . 
  here 's a quote from other reddit post : '' * what , you fuck me over and partition me ? 
  give me a couple of centuries , i stand the fuck up again . 
  you do it again ? 
  i stand up again . 
  oh , you terrorize me and snuff out most of my useful people ? 
  fuck you , i make new ones . 
  well , you oppress me for several decades ? 
  fuck you , i take my freedom . 
  oh , so i am an economic shithole ? 
  fuck you , now i 'm becoming rich !, 
  * '' but the most important thing to know : in colloquial polish `` no '' ( n\u0105 , nom , noms ) means yes !, 
  one magic word - filter ( filtr ) . 
  get rid of pis and their `` army '' , and poof !, 
  it becomes possible . 
  i 'm not a sport fan , but i think we also have one gold . 
  how often do they update it ? 
  i prefer * cicik * ( plural : * ciciki * ) , which means almost the same . 
  we say oj , too . 
  but i 'm not sure if we pronounce it the same way . 
  there are also variations like * ojoj , ojej , oj\u0107 , ojejku , ojojku , ojojoj , etc. 
  * the funniest thing is that there are in some dictionaries :d, 
  but it 's * krk * . 
  afaik , `` r '' functions as `` half-vowel '' in croatian , but i think we need their confirmation . 
  so when somebody sneezes and other person says `` bless you '' or something , he can basically sneeze again to say thanks ? 
  there 's also a sentence * m\u0119\u017cny b\u0105d\u017a , chro\u0144 pu\u0142k tw\u00f3j i sze\u015b\u0107 flag * ( ~ be brave , defend your regiment and six flags ) . 
  it contains all letters of polish alphabet , each only once . 
  potato monster , got ta remember this one :d, 
  `` d\u017a '' is terribly hard to learn . 
  my uncle is from germany and he could n't find this sound for a very long time . 
  iirc , some people wanted to send [ margaret ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/margaretofficialyt?feature=watch ) to eurovision . 
  polish . 
  i 've heard only one of them speaking polish ( the rest did n't know a single word apart from * kur #a * ) and that was a terrible experience . 
  does anybody watch it here ? 
  we never know who to pick , so we usually pick the wrong person . 
  because of this , we never win -  we do n't watch it -  nobody 's interested -  no idea who to pick -  wrong pick -  we never win ... 
  add `` szc sczccz\u015b\u0107\u017c kur #wa \u017a\u00f3\u0142szc z\u017cs ku * va zcz '' and i can agree . 
  but kr\u00f3lewiec has `` kr\u00f3l '' ( king ) part in it . 
  the only king in area i can think of was polish . 
  * please do n't compare it to all the leningrads etc *, 
  now that sounds russian !, 
  * me understands however english computer is no while tasty while english human *, 
  in polish we use terms such as `` prusy kr\u00f3lewskie '' ( royal prussia , part of poland ) and `` prusy ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119ce '' ( ducal prussia , vassal of poland ) . 
  i 'm sure you have similar terms . 
  kr\u00f3lewiec / kaliningrad/k \u00f6nigsberg was n't a part of poland , but a part of prussia actually was . 
  amber is getting more and more expansive , 
  they 'll become independent eventually . 
  the `` risk '' of rising western influence is just too high . 
  they could be rich if they became independent - due to baltic sea , lots of amber , a bit of oil , and quite strategic location . 
  it 's going to be really loud about it tomorrow . 
  unless they ban it or something ( conspiracy theory xd ) . 
  something like this has happened in weather forecast , but i do n't remeber when it was etc. 
  it is weird indeed . 
  i 'm not a history professor , but russia is the last country in region that `` deserved '' it , imo . 
  almost all people i know have generally very positive views of both lithuania and ukraine . 
  i am aware of  quoting , but it looked weird in brackets , 
  could you please stop trying to start a fight ? 
  ( `` but this is what you usualy get when you annex another country 's territory , and wo n't do much ethnic cleansing there '' ) it 's really hard to draw a simple border on a map , especially when you are basically dividing countries that worked as one country . 
  vasa , worst king in our history : s he had an opportunity to rule three european countries , but he was n't able to rule just one ... 
  what if i 'm ambidextrous ? 
  you mean it is not a painting ? 
  defenestration is such a pretty word . 
  i think it could work here , but i live in bytom ( far from warsaw ... ) . 
  people really show support and talk about ukraine a lot . 
  older people often compare this `` event '' to their fight with communism , so not only young people would turn up !, 
  many politicians use twitter and facebook here ( and even answer some questions ) , so i would n't be that suprised ... 
  depends on what kind of trust you mean . 
  that 's not the same . 
  and it was n't like `` we do n't give a fuck '' . 
  it was more like `` how to give a fuck without being fucked '' .
