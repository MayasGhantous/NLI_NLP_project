  many people would be forced to move . 
  there are `` western '' ukrainians in `` eastern '' ukraine . 
  just majority is `` eastern '' . 
   more vodka !, 
  okay , now we can speak . 
  if you are suggesting something , they ca n't be that close ... not in russia . 
  but seriously , that was just ... dunno ... bad ? 
  i do believe in some of their words . 
  that 's enough . 
  i 'm not able to vote yet , but i already have some strong opinions and smell some crap sometimes , if one can say something like this in english  i did n't say he is not a cool guy , i do n't know him personally ( but that would be a great experience i guess ) . 
  all i can say is that i have strong negative feelings towords politician putin , not to guy putin , 
  we can trust him , mods checked him twice , 
  one of you must create a similar thread , seriously . 
  i 'd love to hear a complete history from a ukrainian perspective . 
  maybe because i feel sorry for all the crap roman dmowski ( and some other ) said ( it makes me feel like a stereotypical russian sometimes ) , and maybe because i 'm just curious . 
  while i believe in most of your words and even agree with you mostly , i do n't believe in a single putin 's word . 
  he feels totalitarian to me , really . 
  and i 'm sure i 'm not the only one who feels so . 
  i always try to separate two things : what russians say and what their government says . 
  thank you for sharing and enlightening us all , but as long as putin `` owns '' political scene in your country , i simply ca n't look at it without being suspicious . 
  tourists , tourists everywhere . 
  `` wow this city must be beautiful '' . 
  also , city governments and all `` important people '' want to look as good as they can , so they improve roads , renew old buildings etc. 
   ukraine , the politic something happened to your comment , it looks uncompleted . 
   some people have family in ukraine and if ukraine changes to `` little russia '' , it can affect these people negatively . 
   we have ukrainians who come here to work and study the number of ukrainian immigrants is rising . 
  i think that 's quite good  they may solve our demographis problems ... 
  i 'm under 20 and i use it to chat with several friends . 
  my friend 's whole family uses it ( including her german relatives ) . 
  no stereotypes here in poland ; at least i know none . 
  * [ szlak orlich gniazd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trail_of_the_eagles%27_nests ) * is worth seeing imo . 
  these castles were built to protect poland in case of being invaded by holy roman empire afaik . 
  russia would start . 
  that 's all i can imagine . 
  it used to be . 
  now * piotr * ( peter ) * mateusz * ( matthiew ) and * jan * ( john ) are on top of popular names ' list , afaik . 
  and who 's not-stronk now ? 
  we can all say thanks to our worst king in history : [ zygmunt iii waza ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zygmunt_iii_waza ) . 
  i think that swedes also do n't like this guy . 
  there is no such thing as `` loved by everyone '' . 
  that 's a miracle that democracy `` works '' here . 
  but i guess our carols are generally liked throughout the country . 
  they fail to get international success , because every nation has their own set of carols . 
  i 'll give two cookies to every german that posts an example of cool abandoned tradition . 
  i passed this to god , but he is quite unhappy with religion in your country . 
  he said he would rather help our economy a bit this time . 
  though i see your point , it has some abuse cases . 
  social darwinism used to be considered `` progressive '' . 
  the culture , society and world do n't always go uphill , sometimes they trip over and lay for a while or longer . 
  this could happen , but fights would have to be virtual . 
  sorry , i did n't know which country to pick first , so i opened a map , closed my eyes and pointed the map randonly . 
  btw , what should i pick next ? 
  a series `` what do people learn about ... 
  * country * ? '', 
  would be cool , to be honest . 
  all poles say something different . 
  interesting ... 
  i remember that we had a whole lesson about him ... well he is somehow mentioned in `` core curriculum '' ' ( podstawa programowa ) ' , so all children must know something about him ... at least that he existed . 
  as falcoo0n said , it depends on teacher . 
  and now everybody will think i 'm british ... 
  i could keep my mouth shut  . <, 
  poles love to complain ... 
  allowing us to answer uk , uk or uk was a huge mistake . 
  we will all complain about it now ... 
  i always speed up with every word ... 
  i just ca n't resist doing it . 
  this is the only reason i prefer [ `` nad betlejem w ciemn\u0105 noc '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuyeh7vbgca ) . 
  it sounds as if it was kind of `` new '' ; but it 's really easy , simple and beautiful . 
  also , i 'm not sure if it 's polish . 
  ( i could n't find version with subtitles , sorry ) . 
  oh , we also used to celebrate christmas time by walking from house to house in order to sing carols and wish hosts luck , health and wealth . 
  it was something really similar to your celebration of halloween ( including candies :3 ) . 
  i used past forms because it seems that nobody cultivates it ( at least in cities ) . 
  we celebrate christmas eve more than christmas itself . 
  the only thing that is the same across whole country ( afaik ) is that we have at least ** 12 dishes ** as soon as the first star becomes visible or later . 
  it 's important to leave one set of plates empty for ** unexpected guest ** ( some say that for dead members of family ) . 
  generally , you ca n't walk away from table when you finish : you must wait for the rest ( unless you are a hostess ) . 
  the rest varies . 
  some people share * op\u0142atek * before they eat , some after ( etc. . . ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_in_poland ) wikipedia article is suprisingly good !, 
  that 's interesting :3 got ta google her up . 
  thank you  i was afk , so i could n't reply . 
  i see more and more families getting gifts from both * dzieci\u0105tko * and * \u015awi\u0119ty miko\u0142aj * , by the way . 
  although i realise that it 's all about $ $ $ , i like it . 
  partitions of poland : alcohol edition . 
  same in poland . 
  though some people believe in `` gwiazdor '' or something like this . 
  some families also celebrate [ * trzech kr\u00f3li * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epiphany_%28holiday%29 ) and buy smaller gifts . 
  i celebrate all of them : 6.12 ( smaller gifts from \u015aw . 
  miko\u0142aj ) , 24.12 ( a bit bigger gifts from dzieci\u0105tko ) and 06.01 ( smaller gifts `` from trzej kr\u00f3lowie '' , but even children know that people buy them ) . 
  the problem is : different beings bring gifts in different families . 
  it 's also quite wrong about poland . 
  many people `` believe '' in * dzieci\u0105tko * ( baby jesus/christ kid or whatever ) brings gifts . 
  also , i thought people in italy believe in * jesu bambino * . 
  we need `` how different nations call european countries '' post . 
  a simple link to gallery with 30 maps ... , 
  `` lenkija '' always amuses me . 
  it 's more similar to `` lechistan '' ( which is used in * east-somewhere-land * ) than to poola , polen , poland , polska or whatever . 
  i do n't know what i expected . 
  thank you .
