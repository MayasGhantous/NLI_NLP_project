  whoa , whoa !, 
  second language - ok . 
  but first ? 
  is n't it too much ? 
  so wait ... 
  there are countries where people do n't learn english as their second language ? 
  i started using english when i was three years old . 
  songs , games , movies , sit-coms , internet . 
  i had no choice . 
  approved . 
  we all speak it anyways ... 
  how about gibraltar ? 
  uk and spain argue about it afaik . 
  ( i wanted `` 2 '' , but it autocorrects to 1  . < ), 
  greeks wo n't like this idea , i suppose . 
   str\u010d prst skrz krk that 's cruel . 
  also , i thought `` krk '' = `` river '' . 
  well , i like this idea . 
  it may cost a lot , though . 
  we often use `` fuck '' as well . 
  everybody 's talking about `` kurwa '' and `` pierdoli\u0107 '' . 
  nobody wrote that `` no '' ( nom , n\u0105 , noms ) is a colloquial way of saying `` yes '' . 
  \u00d3 and u or rz and \u017c became one a long time ago , sadly . 
  you can also hear `` h '' by the east border ( thanks to ukraine ) and by the south border ( thanks to slovakia and `` czechia '' ) . 
  ( `` it 's fucked up ! '' ), 
  speaking of job , you can also add that you usually waste `` przepierdalasz '' your salary . 
  most of us say `` ch '' and `` h '' the same way nowadays :(, 
  in polish book ( ksi\u0119ga ) has almost been pushed out of dictionaries by its diminutive case - `` ksi\u0105\u017cka '' . 
  canada is a bit like us without some absurdities we all laugh at  it also has an `` x factor '' i can not describe . 
  i always imagine living in canada as idyll . 
  place with no worries . 
  that 's really amusing :d, 
  pronouncination , nasal vowels . 
  also , language `` developed/evolved '' different under different occupations , so we have quite many synonyms . 
  i know it 's hard to believe , but i would n't . 
  atm i 'm happy here and if i ever decide to move , i 'll most likely stay within borders . 
  most people in poland name it ksawery ( polsish version of xaver ) . 
  afaik , in france people also call it xaver . 
  k\u00f6nigsberg / kr\u00f3lewiec / kaliningrad should be german ( in federation or not )  polish/lithuanian  russian . 
  just my opinion though . 
  agreed . 
   edit : is it just generally a rebellion movie and i 'm simply pasting the most current thing onto it ? 
  i think so . 
  there are so many asians , that if you do n't do your best to be the best , you simply ... idk . 
  they just have much more competition . 
  `` non-violent '' is a key word here . 
  regarding second paragraph , many countries used to be really powerful , including poland ( as a part of the commonwealth ) and sweden . 
  i do n't think that taking some territorries back ( from other nations , some `` new '' nations ) would be okay . 
  lawl , propaganda ate their brains . 
  i know some russians who are really unhappy with russia 's current form and they ran away ... 
  maybe they had no choice or they did n't choose . 
  i doubt if anyone would sign this kind of deal ... o.o, 
  does n't sound bad - i 'd move to eastern part of country . 
  there were better times , though . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  ukraine is ukraine , not poland . 
  it 's like saying united states should be annexed back to united kingdom  . < they developed their own nation ... and we all shall tolerate and accept that . 
  what 's more , we should support them on their way to freedom . 
  it 's suprising . 
  the point of education here is not to teach , but to pass dumb ( imo ) exams . 
  additionally , the system assumes that age = intelligence , which is not usually true ... 
  i feel like it 's bigger every day ... 
  it would solve some problems , would n't it ? 
   orange ukraine would most likely lose the sea , though . 
  poland . 
  i prefer after , because i say it this way ( three * currency * , not * currency * three ) . 
  luckily people use `` z\u0142 '' after prices ( if they use it at all ) . 
  98 % in 2:38 , but i guess it 's unfair - i had to learn it for a contest when i was 12 :p, 
  i love surveys . 
  glad to help . 
  burkina faso yes 0 % - no 100 % sorry , no way !, 
   russia would probably have to be broken up into smaller chunks . 
  some of russian federal subjects would be very pleased , i suppose . 
  well , i like russians , but their country is horrible and it ca n't join eu in its current shape/state/whatever . 
  human rights and democracy -  eu . 
  this is the correct order :p, 
  they would like french to be international language again . 
  try to speak english somewhere in france . 
  and hard to apologize after all the bullshit russian ministry of foreign affairs said about relations between poland and russia ... 
  their `` democracy '' is kinda funny . 
  great way to celebrate national independence day . 
  shame on you all ... that 's even worse that all that `` running paranoia '' . 
  that 's so sweet . 
  thanks , 
  still better than french , imo . 
  `` let 's use all the letters in this word ; let 's read only three ! '', 
  not sure if sarcasm or heavily affected by propaganda . 
  and thanks , that was kind . 
  even we have some flaws , though :p, 
  that 's no very likely to happen , as german would need to beat spanish first , 
  beautiful indeed . 
  i feel photoshop in some photos , but it 's still beatiful . 
  thank you for sharing , 
  i do n't know why , but i liked it . 
  yea , i wanted to point it out , but then i realized that it 's kinda far indeed . 
  definitely worth visiting , though . 
  i 'm not impartial/obiective , so it 's really hard to say . 
  places i enjoyed the most in poland : - salt mine in wieliczka , - old town in zamo\u015b\u0107 , - cracow/krak \u00f3w an toru\u0144 in general . 
  in our region , but not in poland : - prague , - bratislava , - lviv/lw \u00f3w , - vilnius . 
  also , one more suggestion : try to visit national park or two in each country .
