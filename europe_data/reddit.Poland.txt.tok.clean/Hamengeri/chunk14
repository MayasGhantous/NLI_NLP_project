  with a bit of political skill , he could make this kind of union last . 
  but he was too catholic - tried to make protestant swedes catholic ( and they did what they should have ... ) and declined taking russian throne in exchange for becoming orthodox ( part of russian mobility wanted to get rights polish and lithuanian nobles had , so they supported him ) . 
  that 's of course a very short and biased version with no details ( posting from mobile !, 
   all hail sigismund . 
  how about no, 
  that 's exactly why they do such things . 
  to cause fear . 
  ~ ~ it 's really hard to not call russia a terrorist organization these days ... ~ ~, 
  their lack of knowledge and poor language allows them to somehow contain all this in one brain ... 
  til !, 
  thanks . 
  when did we take lviv , hrodna and brest ? 
  do n't let nationalists see this , they may get attatched , lol . 
   germany and france show no signs that they are willing to leave their own languages to install english as the norm language . 
  have you ever been to germany ? 
  have you ever met a german ? 
  i wish we had more opinions over here , just to stay healthy . 
  ^ the ^ government ^ did n't ^ ask ^ any ^ of ^ us , ^ tho ... 
  and the one that offered us to take huge chunk of ukraine , yes . 
  the only thing that has more names is probably rain ... 
  it does n't seem to be very depressive . 
  this is not a kind of person anyone would like . 
  we ca n't be sure what exactly happened , though . 
   google fails at translating it same here . 
  i 'm so desperate i 'm going to try bing . 
  still a human . 
  ( unless you really mean retirement , then yay ! ), 
  and we do n't know the backstory . 
  we know almost nothing about russian ( and belarussian and so on ) political `` backstage '' . 
  call me or my mother whatever you want , but i actually think he might have been a victim of geopolitics . 
  who do you want to replace him with , btw ? 
  zhyrinovski ( or however people write this ) ? 
  other mad imperialist ? 
  he had to balance between world 's opinion , business of oligarchs and his own ( and to some degree , opinion of russians ) . 
  being a president of a broken country is no piece of cake , even if you 're kind of a villain yourself . 
  i think it 's better to wait and see what happens ~ ~ and get ready to flee just in case ~ ~ . 
   the most aryan country  i do n't even, 
   op you should start with your pics plot twist : it 's a stalker and you 're doomed now . 
  they basically are , but sometimes they are `` synchronic '' ( actually said at once ) and sometimes they are `` asynchronic '' ( they are more like some kind of diphthong ) * in general * . 
  their inconsistent nature causes some problems and , mostly because of popular linguistic errors and `` slapdash speaking '' , they evolve - of course differently in different parts of country . 
  aforementioned evolution in most cases means denasalization or asynchronization , sadly . 
  please mind that i 'm not a specialist . 
  i might be wrong or misuse some terms , but i did my best . 
  i 'm not into phonetics enough to answer this , but i know that the difference between them lies mostly in how you * produce * their sound , not their sound itself . 
  it almost is . 
  the difference is very very slight , though . 
  like regional differences between ** \u0105 ** s and ** \u0119 ** s. 
  yeah i 'm tired of these jobstealers and their junkers . 
  yeah , fuck french . 
  most of its users would surrender too soon anyways . 
  on a serious note , english would be perfect not only because everybody uses it already ( yes , even france ... even some parts of uk ) , but also because eu 's biggest ally - which is obviously us - uses it , too . 
  well i guess so , too . 
  but we ** still ** have no proof . 
  and we will never ever have one most likely ... 
  this is the first installment of the series `` what do people learn about ... '' . 
  most of threads will ask you for your knowledge regarding country , but some may have to do with historical events . 
  do not say what you know , i want to know what children learn ( or used to learn ) about certain country or event in school . 
  this week 's installment 's main topic is austria . 
  what do people learn about austria ? 
  it can be anything from something like [ obiady czwartkowe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thursday_dinners ) ( which i definitely want back in some form ) to christmas eve customs . 
  this is the 2nd installment of the series `` what do people learn about ... '' . 
  i guess some people missed first , so here 's a reminder : most of threads will ask you for your `` shool-knowledge '' regarding country , but some may have to do with historical events . 
  do not say what you know , i want to know what children learn ( or used to learn ) about certain country or event in school . 
  as requested , this week 's installment 's main topic is switzerland . 
  so , what do people learn about switzerland ? 
  this is the third installment of my series . 
  i decided to change its name ( people -  children ) , because many people misunderstood me . 
  do not say what you know , i want to know what children learn ( or used to learn ) about ancient greece in school . 
  sorry for delay , i was busy : s so , what do children learn about ancient greece ? 
  it 's the fourth installment of my series . 
  as usual , please do not say what you simply know - i want to know what you learned in school . 
  should i post some kind of index ? 
  this `` week 's '' installment 's main topic is my southern neighbour , czech republic . 
  what have you learned about this country ? 
  it 's the 5th installment of my series . 
  as usual , please do not say what you simply know - i want to know what you learned in school . 
  index coming soon \u2122 . 
  this installment 's main topic is sweden . 
  what have you learned about this country ? 
  please make sure other users know how to pronuonce it ( example : * koszulka * is read co ( like in * cooperation * ) - sh-oo-l ( like in * ball * ) - ka ( like `` ca '' in * camera * ) , what it means , and what is your native language ( if you have no flair ) . 
  so i decided to check if [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m6cqnkh.png ) is legit , and somehow i found [ this # 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_next_100_years ) . 
  some of these visions are reasonable for me , some are not . 
  do you agree with his visions ? 
  do you have your own visions ? 
  creative means nonsense here , okay ? 
  :d let 's forget about ukraine and stuff for a while and relax a bit  my personal favourite is * pojecha\u0107 do rygi * ( literally * to drive to riga * ) , which means ... to throw up . 
  i was quite hungry , so i decided to cook two eggs . 
  but then i thought `` jeez simple eggs , how boring '' and decided to do something crazy . 
  namely , i sliced these eggs and put them in beaten eggs and then in breadcrumbs . 
  then i fried them in sesame oil , sprinkled vegeta on them , and added some ketchup onto two pieces and mayonnaise onto other two . 
  i 'm sure i 'm not the first person ( edit : i actually found some examples of fried eggs in breadcrumbs in the internet ) who tried something like this and that they have their own name and certain ( european , i believe ) origin . 
  happy easter ( or long weekend ) and thanks in advance !, 
   edit : something happened to `` named '' links , i had to remove them . 
  let 's forget about russia for a while and stare at most beautiful european places . 
  i highly encourage you to post your very own , personal photos  if it 's possible , please let the community know where precisely your photo has been taken - it may be a great advertisement for travellers and tourists , 
  all countries have had their attempts to `` build nowadays in the past '' , to build utopia or step slightly towards it . 
  we , for example , had [ warsaw confederation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_confederation ) . 
  how about your country ? 
  i do n't want to miss a thing !, 
  pizza excluded !,
