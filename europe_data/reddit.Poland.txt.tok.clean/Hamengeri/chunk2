  here are their thoughts regarding this : [ \u25ba ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2c4wka/what_are_your_thoughts_regarding_european_union/ ) . 
  and rr . 
   the west should increase the number of russian refugees they accept so they can get liberated . 
  imagine dota2 without russians . 
   early hours of friday morning . 
  for people on mobiles . 
  i will take that minute of your lives back one day . 
  i think we may get back to this if they actually vote in favour of independence . 
  if scotland really secedes , a lot of immigrants may end up in trouble . 
  scotts will need all-new treaties and so on ... 
  they will need to decide whether they want to join nato and eu in referendums and apply if the result is positive . 
  this will also take a lot of time , i believe . 
  some countries may veto scotland in eu just because reasons and ** `` eew separatism , this may be contagious '' ** , but imo it would n't be classy if uk did it . 
  i 've heard they want [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_fiscal_autonomy_for_scotland ) more than `` independence '' as we understand it , though . 
  also , notice how cool the above reddit doodle is !, 
  comments are ok . 
  if voting is something `` we '' do n't want them to do here , we should disable this . 
  if we can . 
  i 'm really stupid when it comes to things like this . 
  i guess i can trust you . 
  independence - no other way . 
  eu entry - no way at all . 
  right ? 
  this picture is simply perfect . 
  both sides ( west and east ) will say that it 's not exactly like this , but this is what uninvolved countries see . 
  this is what historians of future generations are going to see . 
  and * making space * for more immigrants . 
  because they did n't wake up early enough and did n't join `` western block '' in any way ( eu/nato ) . 
  as sad as it is , russia just had ( has ) no real obstacle on the way . 
  i think that ** good ** apple-exporters actually benefit form the embargo . 
  the social pressure to buy apples , eat apples and dominate instagram with apples was so high that they could sell more apples here than they could export to russia . 
  you can greet your , as we say it , babcia . 
  as she has no teeth , she will also most likely enjoy mlekovita 's products . 
  it was putin 's first embargo , iirc . 
  stay strong !, 
   it 's gypsies . 
  i feel ... unemployed right now . 
  either i have bad sources , or we only talk about ukraine and scottish independence :( we also mention that guy from estonia and volleyball . 
  long story short , voiced consonants become their voiceless counterparts at the end of sentences/words , so ** b ** becomes ** p ** and so on . 
  ** if you are interested ** , consonants often become their counterparts by interacting with sounds around them . 
  this is called either * ubezd\u017awi\u0119cznienie * or * ud\u017awi\u0119cznienie * ( translated to ~ unvoicing and ~ envoicing ) . 
  it 's really hard to explain in foreign language without some kind of degree or at least knowledge how all this stuff is called , but you can trust me that it 's natural to all human beings , not just native speakers . 
  this way it 's just easier and ** possible ** to pronounce everything . 
  oh , and just to make it easier , some of them * padaj\u0105 * , but some simply * s\u0105 * or have standalone verbs , like * m\u017cy * or * d\u017cd\u017cy * . 
   and d\u017cd\u017ca and i thought that a long time ago , deszcz was simply de\u017cd\u017c , but it changed due to way we toy with * wyg\u0142os absolutny * ( however it is in english ) . 
  i can confirm that we have too many words for different kinds of rain , though . 
  i 'm not going to make this easier : * \u017byd * = jewish in terms of nationality , * \u017cyd * = jewish in terms of religion . 
  spanish is one of most taught foreign languages in poland . 
  ^ hey ^ geeks ^ please ^ link ^ data ^ to ^ proove ^ me ^ right . 
  for poles who understand czech puns , and for czechs who understand polish at least quite well . 
  music is not what matters here . 
  this is a masterpiece in terms of pun usage . 
  [ \u25ba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_kmmyqiseg ), 
  actually , the biggest problem was n't french or english reaction , but the way the bear behaved . 
  and what foreign languages do they all speak ? 
  why are flats located on 6th floor and above 50 % cheaper in katowice ? 
  you can see sosnowiec from them . 
  / tss / what is the best thing in sosnowiec you can come across ? 
   never return to their home town yea attacks with machete are hard to parry , especially when the victim has more experience with fighting against opponent with knife or baseball bat . 
  everybody makes fun of radom ( especially warsaw afaik ) and sosnowiec ( especially silesia ) . 
  elder people laugh at w\u0105chock . 
  silesia makes fun of warsaw . 
  locally our subject of jokes is radzionk\u00f3w ( bytom ) . 
  i 'm not sure , but i can ask this question next time i participate in something like this . 
  which is most likely soon \u2122 . 
   please mind that this may vary throughout the world and poland does n't tend to reflect worldwide trends , though . 
  it will be nice to see all sides of conflict really want the same . 
  it 's just putin and some barbarians who can benefit from this bloodshed . 
  if your life story is interesting enough , you can look for foreign schools interested in `` lessons with native speaker '' . 
  these are popular ( for example ) here . 
  you just need to ... speak english . 
  and be talkative . 
   they took a piece of ukraine let 's not forget : they did the same in georgia 's case . 
  we call it * \u017cyletka * as well . 
  upper silesia - never heard of it as well . 
  i can add * ksero * ( xerox ) - copier to the list . 
  we also call it `` kopiarka '' ( something-that-copies ) and `` kserokopiarka '' , though . 
  edit : we also sometimes call * pieluszki * pampers . 
  * pieluszka * is - of course - a diaper . 
  edit2 : hi sneakers are someties called * konwersy * ( converse ) . 
  i 'm sure i 'll find some more !, 
  do you really want a letter for each kind of exception ? 
  based * only * on our examples of exceptions , we already need five letters or variations with a dot or something , while single apostrophe could be just fine in all cases . 
  unless people will confuse it with apostrophe we sometimes use with cases of foreign names ending with * y * and so on ... 
  the list goes on and on . 
  i understand that most of exceptions are loanwords , but we really need a way to `` separate '' letters , so we know when not to read them together , as one sound . 
  damn , even a simple ' would bd good , we do n't use it anywhere else . 
  `` and today , children , we will learn to draw oas flag ! '', 
  depends on the sausage , but generally polish and german are the best . 
  italian are also good . 
  oh right , i forgot how quickly it happened !, 
  i 'm wondering why they did n't apply right after elections . 
  or did they ? 
  you basically ca n't see any other race outside of biggest aglomerations like warsaw , katowice and tr\u00f3jmiasto . 
  and even if you are lucky enough to spot one , they are not even permanent residents most likely . 
  it almost does n't exist . 
  pretty much because there are almost only honkies here . 
  `` why die for danzig ? '', 
  ukraine needs some tweaking , but i see them in in about five years . 
  turkey has changed its mind , it seems , i see no way to accept it in current form .
