  georgia could join soon . 
  iceland and norway whenever they want . 
  balkans are still messy and ca n't get over history ( macedonia , kosovo ) . 
  dwarf-states like monaco , andorra and san marino could also join , i see no problems . 
  the first disadvantage that comes to mind is * less money for poland * ( in case of poorer countries ) , and i do n't really see other . 
  united states earned a lot of money like this in the past , so i would be suprised if china decided to miss that opportunity . 
   form your own military partnership to combat any future russian actions . 
  i thought v4 had military structure , got ta google it up precisely . 
   even with coal yes , yes . 
  poland can of making europe stronk and independent . 
  language !, 
  i doubt there is a person who ca n't say a word in english . 
  that explains everything . 
  short guys always aspired to be big emperors . 
  have you ever wondered where the name `` pomerania '' had come from ? 
  * meanwhile in ferguson * sorry , but i 'd rather have two intolerant neighbours than absurdal political correctness . 
  the huge difference is caused by people who were like `` oh stahp , people !, 
  russia has changed !, 
  '' , but now they do n't feel like this anymore . 
  also , i doubt he even cares . 
  russia loves him ( as far as we know ) . 
  a wonderland for gamers and fantasy lovers , you basically pay with `` gold coins '' . 
  it 's not the only problem . 
  poland ca n't join the eurozone unless it changes constitution . 
  '' ... but as we are possibly about to change something , can we change * this , this * , maybe * this , this * and * this * ? '', 
  macedonia is a rough topic . 
  as a pole , i understand that common history may cause problems - we 've had some arguments with lithuanians and other nationalities , but i think majorities of our populations are over it now . 
  most of suwalszczyzna lies within lithuania , yet suwa\u0142ki is a city in poland . 
  lubuskie is a voivodeship in poland , yet lubusz itself is in germany . 
  just examples . 
  this is reasonable . 
  tey can earn a lot of money now . 
  we can accept only european part !, 
  [ i recently asked canadians a few questions ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2c4wka/what_are_your_thoughts_regarding_european_union/ ), 
  maybe it 's a slavic thing !, 
  home-made is the best , no matter if it 's a cookie or a bread , 
  i 'm pretty sure we 'd be called neocolonialists . 
  and 75 % of european society would be against , as islam is strong in these counties . 
  if only people used it this way . 
  what would people discuss if not opinions ? 
  lepsze jest wrogiem dobrego - better is the enemy of good . 
  now that says a lot about culture . 
  * i hate when it 's that rainy and cold ... * * o gustach si\u0119 nie dyskutuje * * hahah , that joke was brilliant !, 
  * * shut up , o gustach si\u0119 nie dyskutuje * * dude , yo saw dat chick ? 
  ^ ^ this, 
  it shuld be `` opinions ( opinion like taste ) are not to be discussed '' or something like that . 
  it * could * be understood as what google translate gave you , though . 
  polish is quite complicated :d afaik , that 's what that latin sentence says , so i used it instead of translating it into english . 
  most likely it 's the original one . 
  not ours but i hate it . 
  nobody uses the original , but i guess i 'd still hate it , because it is dumb . 
  `` nie zaczynaj zdania od * wi\u0119c * '' - `` do not start a sentence with * so * '' . 
  it is not even a rule . 
  it is there for stupid teachers and grannies who think it is a rule . 
  does sigismunt iii vasa count ? 
  i guess majority of swedes hates him as well ... 
  you 're right , but i thought we were talking about vanilla . 
  [ jasna g\u00f3ra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasna_g\u00f3ra_monastery ) : grants +5 culture per turn and +4 defense . 
  provides a free temple with no upkeep in city where it 's built . 
  people are just looking for a proper source of information . 
  belarus is a big mystery for majority of people . 
  sorry if you felt this other way :(, 
  i may sound like conspiracy theory supporter , but when people get rich and influential , they want more power . 
  so they may become a threat to belarussian dictatorship . 
  i think you could do an ama thread . 
  it would be popular . 
  poland : i think we could build something new . 
  i have n't heard of new `` ideal cities '' for a long time . 
  this way , the city can be filled with universal european culture and have subdivisions that refer to certain regions . 
  it could also be placed somewhere in the middle , to make things easier . 
  free  polish  european i wish everything was that simple in my life . 
  it 's more like `` what if these 28 nations wanted to combine into one country '' than `` hey europe , i 'm your dictator and this is your future . 
  kneel ! '' . 
  how could you even compare it to `` you are not even a true nation . 
  gim me your land , stupid russians diagnosed with lack of polonophobia and manipulated by evil western civilization '' . 
   every teenager over here has one of these almost every teenager has * at least * one ask here ... 
   ukraine tommorow i never knew he was such a good seer . 
  but i think he wo n't be right about poland . 
   oil you are sure you want to be independent and not join us instead ? 
   in today 's increasingly globalized world borders are disappearing ~ putin 2014 . 
  only hogwarts express . 
  many poles still believe in the commonwealth and that no matter what happens our great allies will come and tie our shoes . 
  wan na exchange ? 
  oh please , this guy again ? 
  we have year to `` level up '' v4 !, 
   if we were a small country you may get much smaller very soon . 
   it would clearly require a treaty change of course it would , as far as i know , no member country joined just because it wanted to form a powerful supernational country . 
  we have the same or even worse problem : efektowny - efektywny - efekciarski . 
  which country are they going to pay taxes ? 
  internet is not a good place to admit positive feelings towards palace of culture and science . 
  many people ignore the visuals and just care * who * , * why * and * how * built it . 
   poland best land . 
  every country wants a bit of it , do n't you feel so ? 
  many poles also struggle with their very own language , so you have nothing to be ashamed of , 
  but every lidl is different !, 
  we would need an album for every country !, 
  who accepts the challenge ? 
  w\u00f3dka . 
  and everyone understands . 
  of course there is , but one is not that sassy , you know ?
