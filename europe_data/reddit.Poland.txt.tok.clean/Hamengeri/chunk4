  and one has opposition and internal enemies . 
  and ca n't * simply * lie . 
  waiting for russian propaganda videos that will utilize this and the armed forces day iself . 
  i do n't know how legit it is , but if someone writes this at headline , it 's not * only * about money . 
  stands for :  do you want to go to work in northern sweden and earn ** some money ** ? 
  do you have free time in late july - mid september period , car and a bunch of good friends ? 
  go groundcover fruit picking to norsjovallen . 
  we guarantee ** unforgetable adventure ** and ** beautiful views ** . 
  if it was * only * about money , they would work in fast food restaurants . 
  they have more consumers/customers during summer . 
  i 'm of course not saying there are no people who do this * only * for money . 
  i just want to point that it 's more and more commonly adventure , not a real job . 
  of course it 's for money , but it 's not as crucial as it used to be . 
  i 'm talking abut * current * generation , i do n't know how it used to be in the past . 
  but yes , they can still earn more than at home in some cases . 
  when was it ? 
  it 's more of an `` adventure '' than a summer job for majority of poles . 
  usually people who go fruitpicking do n't * need * to , they just * want * to . 
  it 's a new experience in foreign country , something youth highly value . 
  ~ ~ when we need work , we just fly to uk ~ ~, 
   poland was very interested in local border traffic with kalinigrad . 
  this was a mutual initiative of the two sides , both russia and poland , which have done everything possible to make the lives of our citizens easier . 
  and the results have surpassed all expectations -- the border is no longer a barrier to travel . 
  afaik , they mostly visit shops ... 
  i 've heard they buy a lot in poland , especially after these embargo-hype started . 
  also , i support this . 
  i doubt there are jihad-style russians who would be a threat to our safety and i do n't think that russian society is to be punished for what just a few of them does . 
  russia is cool of full dudes !, 
  * meanwhile in sweden * poland ? 
  you mean these people from south who pollute our sea ? 
  i 'd replace elbl\u0105g canal with [ \u0141azienki park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0141azienki_park ) if it 's ok to submit whole park . 
  [ koz\u0142\u00f3wka palace ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/kozlowka_palac_lubelskie_foto14.jpg ) is quite nice and there is one `` wonder '' very important when it comes to culture ( especially in the past ) - [ jasna g\u00f3ra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasna_g\u00f3ra_monastery ) . 
  i also like [ sejm \u015al\u0105ski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_parliament ) and - do not burn me alive - [ this middle finger to all poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_parliament ) . 
  it is hard to pick 7 of them . 
  i 'm waiting for a colorful map displaying `` the most wanted lands of europe '' . 
  each color for a number of countries that have ever owned certain land before . 
  and the history of poland shows it perfectly . 
  did n't see it , we think alike :p, 
  he seems to be the only man ever to get period . 
  you say bbc and reddit are bad ? 
  man , this sucks . 
  * quickly checks if poland has enough seats * . 
  are they going to build something bigger ? 
  assure it that all immigrants will leave it . 
  sounds good ? 
  that 's what they want , but it would ruin them . 
  completely . 
  they - almost * we * - share currency . 
  it was planned . 
   we ca n't set things straight for some reason because of nationalists in both countries . 
  you are high on my ` most ' list anyways , 
   obviously the russian only speaks russian . 
  i always want to report them , but there is no proper category . 
  it would be like 76 % if all churches had website . 
  come to germany before it comes to you !, 
  no it does n't , lawl . 
  how do i know that other countires do n't know something i know ? 
  how do i know what they know ? 
  this is mostly true . 
  sometimes it 's much easier to get something back from germany than any other country ... 
  we have really similar with silesian and a warsawian . 
  stereotypes are the best source of jokes , 
  i also remember that one : pole , romanian and hungarian are in a car . 
  who 's driving ? 
  what 's the slogan above the german ministry for tourism ? 
  come to germany , your grandparets ' furniture and paintings are already here . 
  it flows both ways . 
  the most modern bank in the us wanted to test if money it puts in their best safe is protected enough . 
  to check it , they invited the best and most popular thieves from germany , france , and two random poles . 
  the team who succeeds to open the safe in two minutes can keep all the money the rob . 
  to make it easier , americans shut the lights for the same time . 
  germans are the first to try . 
  the lights are turned off and on again after two minutes , but the safe remains closed . 
  a bit damaged , but closed . 
  french team is next . 
  the lights go out , they swear a lot , but also do n't make it . 
  time for poles to try . 
  lights go out , two minutes pass . 
  americans try to turn lights on , but nothing happens . 
  again . 
  still nothing . 
  after next ten seconds , they hear a whisper : - kur #a , stefan , we have lots of money , leave this fuc ## ng light bulb alone !, 
  i thought you were going to write : `` an apple a day keeps the ~ ~ doctor ~ ~ putin away '' . 
   painted red oh , the irony . 
   cheese filled pierogi you mean * ruskie * ( white cheese with potatoes and a bit of onion and salt ) or * na s\u0142odko * ( white cheese with sugar , sometimes also yolk and * \u015bmietana * ) ? 
  i was just sharing what google recognizes . 
  i did n't know some regions of poland claim them as their own as `` hau\u0142ski '' and so on . 
  til . 
  anything you can eat with ketchup is good . 
  i thought former commy countries knew all the uses of potatoes . 
   hlusky if someone wants to google it up , try `` halu\u0161ki '' . 
  i do n't know if it 's a typo or regional name , but it works better this way , 
  or he 's only had american pizza , 
   i was pretty wtf when i got garlic sauce to my pizza in poland i was pretty wtf when people in italy got suprised when i asked if they serve pizza with it , lol . 
  i thought it was normal throughout europe . 
   bad news this . 
   tv shows were ever no good either most of them sucks , but i find ranczo really funny , especially later seasons . 
  it 's just so chilly . 
  talent shows like x factor are mostly worse than their foreign versions , but they are slowly getting watchable . 
  kuba wojew\u00f3dzki show is sometimes really good - depends on guests .
