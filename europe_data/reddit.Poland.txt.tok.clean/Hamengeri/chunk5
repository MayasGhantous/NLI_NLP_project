  ca n't say anything about radio , though . 
  my complicated music taste does n't allow me to just tune in and listen to all this popular ( sorry ) shit ,, 
   i can tell for neither radio , tv if you want to change this , you can listen to rmf online [ here ] ( http://www.rmfon.pl/play,5 ) . 
  tvn also has a big online [ player ] ( http://player.pl ) , just in case you did n't know . 
  i think that it would be cool if someone posted '' ... from other european country '' in a few days . 
  then , someday , we could post a recipe of most upvoted one . 
  politics is a great topic , but it can be tiring . 
  ros\u00f3\u0142 !, 
  pizza with ketchup !, 
  `` pieprz metystynowy '' sounds too dangerous to legalize it . 
  i see what you did there . 
  i guess it 's a shadow of the past . 
  like we have * tuzin * s and other funny names . 
   skopiowa\u0142e\u015b x plik ( i ) ( \u00f3w ) '' using the above rules , and for female users it should be `` skopiowa\u0142a\u015b ... '' ) . 
  this is why they sometimes use `` skopiowano '' - a non-personal form . 
   belarus is an interesting country because it 's relatively independent from both russia and europe . 
  from europe not really by choice though . 
  it 's our very own ( trr trr trr ) european corea . 
  things that happened 71 years ago around and in wo\u0142y\u0144 are louder here , i feel . 
  i had exactly the same choice . 
  remember not to mind the job . 
  do what you like . 
  if you 're good enough , there will always be a job for you . 
  `` strza\u0142ka '' whas always been a form of greeting for me . 
  like '' \u015bledzik '' and so on . 
  just to make it harder : we also have this in polish . 
  no , i do not support korwin . 
  although he is really wise and so on , what he says is basically `` 97 % people die in hospitals , so people should avoid them '' . 
  okay , i need to give you some details . 
  for example , let 's divide science and education into four levels : elementary ( the only obligatory ) , basic , middle and higher . 
  you have one vote for passing some form of exam for every education level . 
  and then , right before voting , you also are tested if you know how the voting works and so on . 
  what did `` lol '' mean in that case ? 
   remove the two-headed bird from our flag i forgot about details like that !, 
  i 'd change our flag , too . 
  it is just as ugly as simple . 
  beach and palm please , make this red ** noble ** ... 
  i 'd scrap and rebuild education system and voting system immediately , so that they are srtictly bound to each other . 
  higher education ( especially social sciences ) = more votes . 
  most popular form of democracy sucks . 
  stinky , always drunk * mietek * and skinhead recurrence * \u0141ysy * have equal votes with * prof kowalski * and highly educated owner of prosperous bakery chain , * mrs bogacka * . 
  that 's the first thing . 
  there 's just too much to change to write it all ... 
  wow , i did n't know we have users from india . 
  welcome , 
  i guess it 's belgium . 
  what 's that ? 
  this is just as painful as deluge !, 
  it is just not fair to judge us this way !, 
  but it could be true ... 
  if you had one !, 
  you can never know how bad would your country look on such map . 
  i am suprised - and you could be suprised :d just what the hell ? 
  we must go back to the future !, 
  so did i :d hahahahah , this is why you all should invest in eastern poland , or as we say - poland b. 
  \u266b \u266a \u266a bus red and inside of it - people like all of you everybody looks at it , as if they 've seen their city for the first time / \u266a \u266b * time is not standing still ( in polish we say so , dunno if there 's something similar in english ) , but a bus can stand in a museum . 
  milionyou , we listen to people . 
  well , it 's something you have to think about twice . 
  treat it like a poem . 
  i do n't know . 
  but i 'm definitely not okay ... 
  mind the 1337 speak  brudas - somebody dirty , quite offensive . 
  here 's what that guy says : * do n't have mercy for disabled bus that drives your child . 
  check bus by registration plate 's number at www.bezpiecznyautobus.gov.pl ( `` safebus '' ) . 
  safe bus - free service of ministry of interior . 
  it was n't about the amount of men , it was just about counter-reformation and political disability of sigismund iii vasa , which both led to many , many wars , which could have been easily avoided . 
   it 's a shame we have so many t\u0336h\u0336i\u0336n\u0336g\u0336s\u0336 neocommies to take care of before we can . 
   i do n't think the russians like being commanded by others they like to be commanded by single person . 
  sun never sets !, 
  yes . 
  but we ca n't agree how much we want to tie ourselves and each other closer . 
  i like the way you think . 
  so how do you want to pick the most capital capital of europe ? 
  there is no way to pick one , without creating a horde of angry people . 
  capital could move just like presidency . 
  like all former colonies ? 
  :d we 'd be the only power then xd, 
  / r/polishtapes ? 
  but other voters ... 
  poland is not considered eastern . 
  suddenly map becomes good . 
   i have n't been following the story too closely neither have i , but let 's just wait how it ends . 
  currently 80 % of news regarding is just a speculation and stuff , i guess . 
  what 's more : ignoring somebody in a real need is illegal . 
  you can end up in prison for up to three years , just because you passed by instead of helping . 
   less people are moaning about the polish railways . 
  in other words , population of poland is shrinking . 
  they 'd most likely be just longer . 
  we do n't like new words here . 
  if anything is `` new '' , we just give it a name consisting of adjective ( or participle ) and a noun ( usually ) , and we never `` cut '' it . 
  ( we also love loanwords , but it does n't matter now ) . 
  not being included in your list is an honor , i guess . 
  yes , i did n't write `` russians '' purposefully , because i mean `` the bad red people '' , not the good , innocent folks . 
  every third ikea 's furniture is made in poland , according to their ads . 
  so we would still have ikea , just with less stuff . 
  conclusion : muslims die at very young age ? 
  fun fact : there are two in warsaw . 
   they just really like statues i do like statues . 
  i want moar :3, 
  wow , you remember :d could it be we started a meme here ?
