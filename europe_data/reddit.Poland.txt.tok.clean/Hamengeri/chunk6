   i feel sad and worried because of what i feel it would say about european unity and the future of the eu . 
  in the past , we had almost-multicultural and multicultular countries consisting of a bunch or pair of nations . 
  we needed some kind of unity , it used to give us power . 
  but now , we have european union . 
  we are united . 
  all . 
  we can now have our very very own national countries . 
  and we are still united . 
  so what 's the point of commonwealths like uk ? 
  hp survived in polish butthurt catholic societies , so i guess he 's safe . 
  so is newer prediction 20 % higher ? 
  i think now it 's time to stop putting hellota money in villages , and focus on keeping cities and towns ok instead ... and 80 % of so-called `` wastern '' poland is just as urbanized as wisconsin ( accoring to us jokes ) . 
   he can agree i thought that he said `` but not me , i 'm too old '' or something . 
   this is not how every pole thinks yeah , only about 3 % . 
  the rest votes for him just because he brings something new to the table , is not afraid to tell whatever he thinks and simply because it 's trendy . 
   no marriages for homosexuals do they have some other kind of partnership or something ? 
  well , gay sex is disgusting for me , but if somebody likes it , why would i forbid him ? 
  people have problems accepting differences . 
  not sharing beliefs and opinions is not bad ( it 's good in most cases ) , bitching about differences is . 
  that 's the point of tolerance , imo . 
  have you ever browsed wp.pl 's comment section ? 
  it 's even worse . 
  the russian propaganda army would be proud of these comments . 
  hi lithuania , sorry for these idiots ... 
  i would be neutral , but one of these polish separatist movements in your country is full of commies , while second is full of hatred ... also , i live in silesia and i definitely do n't support ra\u015a , 
  they grew enough to block every single turkey 's attempt . 
  and have a look at `` modern '' turkey . 
  even ukraine is more democratic and so on . 
  poles polonize it and say either \u0141ukaszenka or \u0141ukaszenko . 
  now that 's how to start a war between grammar nazis . 
  lawl , give this man a cookie . 
  i 'm sure they 'd rather use [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/flag_of_belarus_%281991-1995%29.svg/1000px-flag_of_belarus_%281991-1995%29.svg.png ) . 
  not the `` soviet '' one . 
  suprise ? 
  i noticed a wave of pro-putin and anti-western comments at wp.pl . 
  this site has never been any good , tbh , but when these comments started to show up , wp became my favourite comedy . 
   i do n't think anyone 's against scotland having the referendum . 
  companies that sell tons of clothes and stuff with union jack ? 
  currently , it is quite disappointing and smells a little bit like t\u0336e\u0336e\u0336n\u0336 \u0336s\u0336p\u0336i\u0336r\u0336i\u0336t\u0336 populism , but in the long run , we 'll most likely thank us for giving us a reason to strenghten our european ties . 
  wait , what ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_languages ), 
   id say they are probably the least insane people outside of europe . 
  and most likely apologizes for disturbing !, 
   equalize the living standards within , then talk about further expansion . 
  deep inside i think that 's how it 's supposed to be . 
  we even had dunkin donuts at some point , but  they 're not very popular so guess what happened . 
  i 'm not sceptical by any meaning , and i still think we could have less seats . 
  the problem is , the banner was planned in advance . 
  are you nuts ? 
  they fake usd so good that they are better than real usd . 
   but what we do not learn is the history of other countries within the eu . 
  we do , of course , not as `` precisely '' , but we are taught about foreign `` bigger events '' . 
  for curious with good translating tools : http://www.mrat.pl/pdf/nowe_podstawa/podstawa_historia.pdf this is what all children aged ** 16 ** must know ( they still have three or four school-years to go through ) . 
  it is as basic as possible , textbooks are actually quite richer . 
  teenagers should also remember wwii and so on , because they learn about it one `` stage '' before . 
  at first it was quite hard , but then i could read it efforlessly . 
  however , it 's not more similar than - for example - czech , imo . 
  this is opole 's fault !, 
  they 've always wanted to have their very own access to sea ... 
  every `` lost city '' will look like this or similar , i think . 
  yea , just like our southern neighbours . 
  very similar , yet different . 
  well i saw something being done by wadowice two years ago ... 
  but even if it was what i thought it was , one * thing * is not enough . 
  if anyone 's interested , southern poland is also flooding , but the situation is not that bad ( yet ) . 
   what makes you think there 's not even a word about what i think . 
  i just pointed out that there are less boobs and asked if this * song * could have gathered more votes . 
  it 's definitely not my kind of music , so i do not express personal opinion about quality and stuff . 
  i do n't want to start wars like `` rap is crap '' and so on . 
  thank you for your opinion . 
  that 's what i expected . 
  we have the same abnormality here . 
  well we freak people out with insects : beetle [ \u25ba ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/pl-chrz%c4%85szcz.ogg ) and bee [ \u25ba ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/pl-pszczo%c5%82a.ogg ) . 
  they get even scarier if they live in suwalszczyzna [ \u25ba ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/pl-suwalszczyzna.ogg ) . 
  both hungarian and czech are much better in scaring this way , to be honest . 
  the problem is , he was both . 
  it 's just like with some jews . 
  i do n't get why lithuanians have no problem accepting it , while poles are so selfish that they want mickiewicz for our own ... 
  i feel like europeans like americans , they just want to be # 1 again , so it may rarely seem that we do n't like you . 
  + we have huge diaspora , 
  i 've never been so happy to learn new word . 
  i hate plenks !, 
  * wsip , one of most popular textbook publishers , wants to sue ministry of education for copying textbooks [ \u25ba ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wydawcy-oskarzaja-men-o-plagiat-zapowiadaja-spotkanie-w-sadzie-men-odpiera-zarzuty,427446,s.html ), 
  i 'd risk with `` 89 % '' `` vote '' for i\u0336n\u0336d\u0336e\u0336p\u0336e\u0336n\u0336d\u0336e\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336n\u0336e\u0336t\u0336s\u0336k\u0336 . 
  maybe because of belarussian minority in belarus ? 
  i mean , these that are more bela than russian . 
  well iirc , lithuania told her to shave , 
  she may be putin 's proof how bad the west is . 
  i 'm not suprised . 
  for me 70 % of conchita 's success is just the controversial and provocative look . 
  but well , what 's the difference ? 
  are we really going to post here every partcipant with `` vote me '' caption ? 
  according to this wiki article , it is high-context and i agree . 
  the easiest way to check if this article is true ? 
  just recall some jokes . 
  i 'm not opposing it , i 'm just contemplating . 
  thanks for enlightening me , 
  when the time is right , we may become a federation . 
  but as long as there 's no need and not enough support , let 's not force it . 
  if it is to happen , it will happen eventually .
