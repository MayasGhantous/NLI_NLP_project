  it would n't be hard to suggest people start learning other language . 
  people who use english as first language , also learn other languages . 
  for some it is french , for some it is spanish or german . 
  look at it as if you were an alien . 
  it gets quite absurd , because everyone could just learn * nobody 's language * . 
  but would n't federalizing europe force common foreign policy ? 
   these things will happen over time anyway there 's no need for them to happen , at least not for language . 
  i speak two languages fluently ( well , almost ) and to be honest i 've never really * studied * english . 
  by the way - english . 
  is n't it quite unfair that it 's english ? 
  i 'm not against , but why not french or a conlang like esperanto ? 
   common foreign policy it 's sometimes hard for a single nation to have common foreign policy . 
  imagine how hard it would be for 28 or more nations to agree on just one opinion . 
  european federation would hardly ever say anything , because there would always be enough people disagreeing . 
  the mentality of nations also differs throughout europe . 
   common security if you mean military , this would require common foreign policy . 
   fiscal/monetary union actually i 'm not against monetary union , but as currency is sometimes a part of national identity and has deep ties in history , i 'd rather see something like in uk happening . 
  scotland has its own pounds , but they are always equal to gbp . 
  it is possible , but i do n't want federal europe . 
  why would i ? 
  i want ** unity through diversity ** , not ** unity through unity ** . 
  i want international union , not supernational union , if you know what i mean . 
  europe is all about different , but related cultures . 
  federation could destroy it . 
  60 % of protesters are 50 + . 
  world wars taught us many things , do n't forget about this . 
  we lost our hegemonic position - it reminded us that we are not the only cultural circle here . 
  that all these colonies can live their own lives ; there are also other cultural circles with their own culture , with their own history , with their own power . 
  in their estimation , they are the center of world . 
  we can not waste deaths of milions . 
  and always remember this and other lessons . 
  \u266b we are world of contrasts , \u266a \u266a we know no peace , \u266b our magic item in pocket has acces to all wisdom , \u266b \u266a but we use it to watch funny cats , and more preferably - to argue \u266a we do n't all understand this , \u266b \u266a but that 's nothing new : western culture thinks it is `` the world '' , \u266b i am a bad phoet . 
  #panic , huh ? 
  all i can say is wow :d, 
  that area is problematic . 
  it 's like a drunk piece of balkans that has travelled and has no idea what it 's doing . 
  to be honest , any is good . 
  if it 's too small for pc , it will be just fine on laptop ( smaller in my case ) or mobile !, 
  smuggling is already a thing along our russian border and i 'm sure it 's same in lithuania 's case . 
  our `` border services '' are used to it . 
   law on political parties which requires that each party should have regional branches at least in half of the russian federation constituencies definitely not aimed at separatist movements xd, 
  sooner or later they would starve without secessing from rf . 
  putin is just spamming embargos on meat , diary products and all kind of `` goods '' from poland and lithuania - he is the one proposing extermination . 
  i highly doubt they are self-sufficient . 
  the master of evil :d but well , let 's save this for ... full-swing times of new cold war . 
  it 's actually a big deal :o just wondering if events like this could be some kind of way to independent kaliningrad . 
   stones for the rampart i can recommend it , too . 
  after ( and only after ) reading the book , i can also recommend a movie based on it - kamienie na szaniec ( 2014 ) . 
  it may be impossible to watch it , though . 
  i 've never seen english subtitles for polish movie . 
  the only exceptions are tv series aired on tvp polonia ... 
  we have something similar , this is why we have sound berms - `` screens '' ( as we call them ) by almost every freaking road ( not to mention our uncountable highways ) . 
  sometimes even in the middle of the forest ( after a long time of contemplating i came to conclusion that maybe they have been placed to decrease amount of weird noises that used to bother animals ) . 
  and an average pole . 
  we have three days off here : 01.05 - labor day/st . 
  joseph 's ( catholic ) 02.05 - flag day ( though it 's not free for majority ) / day of polish diaspora 03.05 - may 3rd constitution day / st virgin mary the queen of poland ( catholic ) . 
  saint mary was coronated by john ii casimir 01.04.1656 in lviv . 
  * ruch narodowy * and korwin mikke 's support are growing , though . 
  so sadly we may give other answer in a few years ... 
  jesus , and i thought our far right was annoying . 
  iceland - they would pay more than they would receive , macedonia - greece will deny it , turkey - `` democratic '' reasons , kosovo - spain will deny it ( because of catalonia ) , ukraine - do n't even need to say a word . 
  the list of `` official '' candidates differs from `` real '' candidates . 
   hitler started by annexing neighbouring countries he started with a book  but i see what you mean and agree . 
   even though other longer words can be composed by assembling adjectives . 
  i thought they were looking for longest words . 
  no , but policemen who do n't know this , do this with people , who also do n't know this . 
  yes , this is retarded . 
  only lower silesia flair , afaik . 
  i guess he supports * ruch autonomii \u015al\u0105ska * or just is attached to upper silesia . 
  i hope nobody will ever post warsawian version of this . 
  it would be too funny and embarassing at once for me . 
  well `` poles '' is n't an individual country either :d, 
  hispter poland stronk . 
  one of firsters . 
  ** personal opinion starting ** well , prussia was protestant . 
  russia was orthodox . 
  so poles had to find something they could have in common , but occupants could n't . 
  so , screw the possible federations , screw the jews , lithuanians , ruthenians and `` ukrainians '' - we are catholic now , everybody !, 
  you 're not catholic - you are supporting the occupants !, 
  and then , during soviet times , we had pope , who wanted to awake our patriotism - but by the way , he pulled us to churches . 
  going to church was one of the most popular ways of showing soviets that they have no real power or influence . 
  first part is sad , i would really fancy living in multicultural intermarium or something like this . 
  but then again , some nations would n't , because some of our rightist politicians wanted to polonize them . 
  however ( ... ) , then again ( ... ) ... 
  but who knows how it would end up , if it were n't for st ( since today ) john paul ii ? 
  everything has bright and not-so-bright sides . 
  `` atheist '' was supposed to have a very positive meaning here , but yes , there are some people like this . 
  if far-right politician ever wins any kind of elections , i 'll definitely run away to czech cieszyn or prague :p, 
  not very patriotic , atheist , funny , quite suspicious . 
  i 'd rather call it beautiful . 
  it 's just not even a bit similar to any language i know . 
   `` biedronka '' ( polish largest grocery chain ) biedronka is actually portuguese , afaik . 
  most people suprisingly hate it , it 's just a matter of time and it will have no real concurrence . 
  that will piss people off . 
   poor quality food you really want a war :d and what do you have except * smazen\u00fd s\u00fdr * ( sorry if misspelled ) ? 
  i remember we shared * ludwik w\u0119gierski / andegawe\u0144ski * in 14th century . 
  literally all of them !, 
  well if i were to solve these problems , i 'd just let poles use their letters and street names ( the way nobody will thank populists for it ) - not because * that poor christ of nations , the martyr-contry is oppressed again * , but simply to make the populists shut up and in consequence , lose support  they may be very dangerous with more support , because - as you stated - their only purpose is to damage our relations , which were ( and i hope still are ) getting back better after some painful both-side experiences . 
  oh god , poles . 
  well , poles believe that poles complain a lot .
