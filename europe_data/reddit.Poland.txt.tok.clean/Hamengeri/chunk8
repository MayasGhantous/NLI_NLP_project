  they ca n't do anything together and are really egoistic . 
  they , as a nation , are crystal clear , just for no reason at all , the bad nations do n't like them . 
  they love conspiracy theories and shamelessly drink too much . 
  they are poor and weak country ( as for european and na standards ) , but would like to be viewed as important , rich and powerful , just because we ( whoops , they ) used to be few times in history . 
  80 % of population has mixed or negative feelings about and towards generalized poles . 
  cough : turkey :d imo , ukraine is only a bit more european than turkey . 
  ^ comparison ^ that ^ can ^ start ^ a ^ war , ^ sorry, 
  when is it and who 's participating ? 
  poles do n't really care about it anymore . 
  is that a challenge ? 
  wow thanks , i 'm sure that about 0.000001 $ of what you spent will go dirctly to me !, 
  i 'm sure somebody ( most likely from america ) bought them and they are no longer polish :p it happens all the time here . 
   it should be served in a card box with frites and a soft drink of your choice mcdonald 's breakfast menu 2015 . 
  god , please . 
  that 's almost the same !, 
  got ta try `` green eggs '' , they should taste a little bit like polish version of of french roulades ( rolady/zrazy ) . 
  this portion was supposed to be salty ( it had flour , though ) , but sweet version should be just like you suggested . 
  maybe next time , 
  is there something you ca n't give a finishing touch with ketchup ? 
  it does n't have a special name , simply * pomidory z czosnkiem i bazyli\u0105 * ( tomatos with garlic and basil ) . 
  one of `` big '' companies that sell such mix is * kamis * , you 're lucky : according to wikipedia , they do sell in russia , ukraine , romania , czech republic and slovakia . 
  sounds good , but tastes even better . 
  with knowledge of its origin , i could try more similar miracles . 
   add some coarse-ground wallnuts to the coating mix i actually prepared second portion that had persian/english/california ( or as we call it * w\u0142oski * - italian ) walnut and it was a great idea , got ta try it with ground walnuts . 
  edit : false friend ... 
  in polish `` ground walnut '' stands for peanut , damn you , synonyms . 
  it should also be good with mashed corn flakes . 
   replace vegeta with ( . . ) tri-color pepper i 'd rather replace it with a mix of dried tomato , basil and garlic ( a quite popular mix here in poland ) . 
  it was just a quick decision to use vegeta . 
  the taste of tomato would allow me not to add ketchup and focus on mayonnaise ( or some kind of mayonnaise-based sauce ) . 
  regarding name , * jajko w skorupce * sounds good . 
  it stands for egg in ( egg ) shell . 
  nice !, 
  i wish my city had ideas like this . 
  maybe when they do something with our colors and coat of arms : s, 
  this is the saddest history of human being ever told . 
  get some chocolate !, 
  how about pro-warcraft countries ? 
  and then they 'll invade us from the east . 
  and when there 's nothing to invade , they will invade themselves . 
  o.o i guess you do n't support minimalism . 
  and i thought it symbolized the equality of the king ( white ) , the nobles ( blue ) and the ... the rest ( red ) . 
  til , 
  thank you  ^ ( it 's very despicable , though ), 
  made my day :d, 
  what servers do you play on ? 
  i barely ever see russians [ not sure if  or :( ], 
   free crimea works better in strategy games ( especially on maps that reflect earth ) . 
  why has nobody mentioned * pierogi * ? 
  i thought they were famous . 
  if you like german sausages , try polish * kabanosy * !, 
  so you are responsible for lack of winter here , you thief !, 
  you took yours and stole ours !, 
  120 % of them . 
  well , a bit . 
  i thought ... actions like this were a closed chapter . 
  imo the funniest weekly news from poland ever . 
  ^ prisoner , ^ hole , ^ palm ^ contest ... 
  i 'm glad they did n't try to provoke us . 
  some poles would clearly respond with violence ... 
  it may be much more thoughtful than it seems . 
  and he tried to kill john paul ii , twice . 
  new conspiracy : kaczy\u0144ski blew his brother up to win elections . 
  transatlantic union , crossatlantic union , united western nations or something like this . 
  i would welcome them , but why would they enter ? 
   african countries they would accuse us of neocolonialism . 
  22 people tried to save their lives . 
  like * za\u017cenowanie * in polsih , if that helps . 
  looks like yes , in most cases , thanks . 
  no , that 's * kraw\u0119\u017cnik * . 
  well , the known examples are * kombinowa\u0107 i za\u0142atwi\u0107 * , but there are many more , like * tumba * - pistil that separates pavement from the street ( i do n't know exact translation , neither does google ) , * miedzuch * - small , tight street in the city ( it 's almost never used nowadays ) . 
  word taken - * prze\u017cytek * is something , that used to be useful , but now it 's useless or has much better alternatives , like an mp3 player . 
  it 's much better than * niedobitek * , but it ca n't be used in the hunger games , for example . 
  -  `` there are no winners , only survivors '', 
  * niezr\u0119cznie * is almost perfect . 
  okay , but it still makes no sense in case of plane crash . 
  :( so so would i ; /, 
  this is just so pesimistic . 
  niedobitek ahahha xd it 's like `` he was supposed to die , but he did n't , sadly '' . 
  they use `` have to '' the same way , though it 's not the same . 
  survivor - either i 'm stupid , or we do n't have this word . 
  though - you can translate it . 
  there is no word with the same meaning that can be placed at the end of sentence , though . 
  sorry , i translated it , but i clicked the wrong `` reply '' button . 
  it 's there ^, 
  most important american bases in europe nato countries countries russia recognizes as its sphere of influence new border dividing europe, 
   russia is embargoing import of meat from poland and lithuania good luck , kaliningrad . 
  i 'm talking about poland , not whole eu . 
  we are not * poor * , but we are far from being * rich * . 
   they dont fit in the architectural style of old european cities this is why some cities have two ( or more ) ... `` centres '' . 
  one modern , and one `` historical-cultural '' . 
   low risk of natural disasters we have almost no risk of natural disasters here , but there 's something more needed . 
  hint : ** $ $ $ **, 
  waiting for \u015awiebodzin 's answer . 
   the two languages are so similar that polish television often interviews ukrainians without translation . 
  [ seriously ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/pl-bujda_na_resorach.ogg ) what kind of tv do i watch then ? 
  more like cowards , stiffs and poor moaners . 
  come and help us !, 
   it 's making great strides in european integration `` for our freedom and yours '' ,
