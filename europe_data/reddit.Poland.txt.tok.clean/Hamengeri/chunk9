  this is one of the most powerfull anthems ever . 
  it makes me feel commy for almost for minutes . 
  well , we call it `` traditionally '' * prima aprilis * . 
  we celebrate it with all kind of jokes - little ones and enormous hoaxes . 
  i 'm already terrified ... 
  there are like 1000 jokes like this , each is just perfect . 
   4th line meanwhile in warsaw ... 
  well , i 'm looking forward to results . 
  where could they meet ? 
  do they trust each other enough to meet in russia/western contry ? 
  spain did n't recognize kosovo , because ... * cough * catalonia * cough * . 
  am i right ? 
  :d there are many more ... 
  even in english . 
  and i think it 's just a provocation - he tried to wake far-right nationalists in our contry , the ones who want to take lw\u00f3w / lviv and so on . 
  i 'm wondering how much i may pay for a postcard to us ( i guess it 's us ) , but who cares ? 
  that 's so sweet that i ca n't simply ignore it . 
  edit : i 'm totally in . 
  now that 's a cool collection :3 ty for sharing . 
  maybe you 're right ... 
  but some drawbacks are huge :p  i mean even that huge christ statue recently built you mean aragorn ? 
  it 's quite nice , but they put it in really stupid place . 
  i love statues and stuff , but christ statue is the last i would like to see - there are sculpts of jesus and saints in almost every church : v, 
  not always . 
  but it really sucks to have a king like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund_iii_vasa ) . 
  he had a chance to rule in russia , commonwealth and sweden , but he was a catolic fanatic , so nope . 
  lol , our worst king in history . 
  he is the one who started to change the `` heretic asylum '' to `` butthurt catholic land '' . 
  he is the one who stopped good neighbour relations with turkey . 
  at least afaik . 
  yea , first `` shared area of european union '' . 
  that would be quite interesting , but let 's not start a war , please :p * nie dzielmy sk\u00f3ry na nied\u017awiedziu *, 
  but i feel bad for people who live there . 
  that 's quite pesimistic , but sadly it looks like putin does n't really care . 
  kaliningrad has borders with only one other country - poland , the country that shouts for eu sanctions on russia louder than any other : v i do n't think they are 100 % self-sufficient ... 
  this means that when putin and eu close both borders , citzens of kaliningrad oblast will starve and may migrate . 
  they do not realize how bad it is for kaliningrad , or i 'm overreacting ? 
  oh right , china . 
  we also say `` chi\u0144szczyzna '' ( which can also be something we ca n't understand and makes no sense ) . 
  something can also be * chi\u0144skie * ( chinese ) * lewe * ( left ) or * lewackie * ( leftist ) . 
  * g\u00f3wno prawda * * bzdura * * banialuki * * bujda * ( also in phraseme : [ bujda na resorach ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/pl-bujda_na_resorach.ogg ) = `` crap on leaf springs '' ), 
  you know what 's cute ? 
   maybe there 's loads of you online this . 
  if 60 % of players on this server are from poland , i would risk and say that consequently 60 % of noobs there are polish . 
  just a guess and random numbers though . 
  well , there are many myths and stereotypes , some of them are true , some are not . 
  but the most offending fake ( in most cases ) stereotype ( `` myth '' ) is that we are all flamers in online games . 
  that we are all noobs and so on . 
  jeez , i just ca n't stand it . 
  i can get over maaany many more myths , and even make fun of them , but this one is unbearable . 
   poles believe they have a special message , even a special gift , to convey to those around the world who struggle for liberty and civil rights , and especially to ukraine . 
  poles love romanticism , that 's all . 
  how about [ dick in wroc\u0142aw ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/breslauskytower.jpg ) ? 
  let 's say whole eu basically stops trading with them . 
  we actually can replace them with other eu countries , right ? 
  they can replace us * completely * only with china , right ? 
  they would `` lose '' trade-off like this . 
  there are so many `` better '' places they could include ... 
  but well , +1 , still good . 
  on a serious note , i do n't think it 's comparable . 
  it 's comparable to unsolvable problem of , as we call it , lw\u00f3w . 
  governments most likely have their translations of this . 
  but translating something like this is like letting the foreign propaganda flow through country . 
   poland should be granted a `` special status '' in the eurasian sphere . 
  wow , such a distinction . 
   kaliningrad oblast could be given back to germany . 
  as i said , `` some '' are not reasonable xd, 
  okay , why would we ? 
  according to tradition , they must be removed by 02.02 ( or 02.02 for ` muricans ) . 
  namely `` da\u0142 nam przyk\u0142ad bonaparte jak zwyci\u0119\u017ca\u0107 mamy '' , which translates to `` bonaparte has given us the example of how we should prevail '' ( edit : i replaced my translation with wikipedia translation - the difference is not big , but still ) . 
  no ... my whole life is a lie . 
  i have never noticed . 
  poland can democracy !, 
  i hope we wo n't need these , though . 
  ehm , is n't our flag reversed ? 
  this building is beautiful : v, 
  i was waiting for this for a long time . 
  russians may invade you or us if we say something like this once more . 
  poland stronk - in top 25 :d, 
  well , they simply need him to make it look as if crimea needed help . 
  this way if they actually invade , a small part of the world ( if we can call 1/3 of russia and her `` satelite countries '' small ) will believe that russia wanted to help . 
  that russia was fighting for rights of russian minority in ukraine or something . 
  poles , lithuanians and swedes can confirm . 
   we need a change of ruling party asap . 
  we need a change of two leading parties asap . 
  there are less decent politicians in pis and po combined than there are matches we are going to win during euro 2016 . 
  and i 'm optimistic . 
  who is going to replace him on all these pediments ? 
  what if they are just making place for putin monuments ? 
  i was suprised , to be honest . 
  not just soviets , wars in general . 
  human greed of power and wealth . 
  i did n't even use word `` force '' ... 
  i 'm just pointing out that it was really hard to split europe between so many nations . 
  that 's the same . 
  i see no point in this comment . 
  but silesia was much less polish than these territories . 
  remember that it is really hard to draw a border . 
  many ukrainians lived within today poland 's borders and the other way around . 
  same with lithuania and belarus .
