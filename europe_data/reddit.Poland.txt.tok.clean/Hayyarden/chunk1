nowy s\u0105cz king w\u0142adys\u0142aw jagie\u0142\u0142o and grand duke vytautas planned here their campaign against teutonic order in 1409 . 
  also it 's like biggest city near the border with slovakia , so a lot of them come for shopping in our malls , 
  iirc teutonic knights attacked and conquered gda\u0144sk in 1308 . 
  before it was just polish castle . 
  but you know , where berlin lays today one thousand years ago was veletian city . 
  do we claim this clay as ours ? 
  based irish always sitting in pubs , so they ca n't be bothered in home . 
  i 'd say polish history classes are very well balanced except for teaching about first half of 18th century , when our commonwealth started to visibly rot and decay . 
  i do n't think any of my classmates would be able to recognize what was seven years ' or silesian wars . 
  like we come to great northern war , then long long nothing and bam !, 
  - french revolution . 
  my god , it 's still a lot more than in poland http://www.goniecwolnosci.pl/assets/images/k.jpg ( also for 100k inhabitants ), 
  i used to consider germany ( at least west ) to be very nice and , what 's most important , safe country . 
  then , during a certain trip , i got lost in frankfurt and wandered to some neighbourhood ( although i 'd swear it was like the center of the city ) full of scary looking turks and drug addicts laying on pavements . 
  jeezus , i was so scared . 
  machete city ( cracow for non-poles ) feels so much safer . 
  on the other hand tho , i enjoyed hell of a time during my stay in heidelberg . 
  so yeah , now i do n't know what to think about germany . 
  chinese people are not `` largely buddhists '' . 
  only 10-15 % of population iirc . 
  what a kremlin 's propaganda bullshit . 
  i do n't know why , but listening to this version always reminds me of gummi bears opening ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hcjqbkowuo, 
  if someday eu becomes empire instead of federation , there is only one appropriate language to be used at an imperial court - german , 
  ehh , i think everything 's quite alright here . 
  this type of writing does not have its official ortography , so perception of what should be written where might vary . 
  umm , care to give an example of `` using it randomly '' ? 
  ` t ' is like in ` touch ' , 's ' is like english ' ` servant ' or ` certain ' , ` z ' is softer , like in ` using ' or ` zoom ' . 
  and there is ` sz ' and ` cz ' - equivalents of english ' ` sh ' and ` ch ' . 
  actually our ` w ' is always the same as in ` wunderbar ' ( english ' ` v ' ) , i just used it here as the replacement of ` f ' to sow greater confusion  rest of my text is correct ( how poles pronounce letters - wise ) though . 
  and about \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ... 
  it 's just simple ` wut\u0361\u0255 !, 
  aj ofn rajt lajk dys \u0142yt maj frends end \u0142i ol\u0142ejs anderstend icz ader . 
  yt ken bi k\u0142ajt najs eksesajs tu refink jor persepszyn ow ha\u0142 ju spel fings end ha\u0142 dej akszuali szud bi prana\u0142nsd . 
  why not ? 
  or maybe inside !, 
  descendants of romanovs , duh, 
  in the place where borders of austria , germany and czech republic meet . 
  there are some hills , a lake , forest ( which is actually dying , so there would be no harm in clearing it ) - overall pretty nice place i think . 
  about name i 'm not sure , probably would name it after some great scientist , like copernicopolis or sth . 
  the city itself would be full of museums and palaces filled with art . 
  +1 for die welle and gbl seen in german class . 
  except syrians might steal our bikes at best , not jobs . 
  dude , that bait 's waaay too big , i doubt you 'll catch anyone with it : c, 
   richer parts maybe silesia , the other provinces are kinda poor , tend to have high unemployment , crime rate , low scores at matura exams . 
  well about that . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=11&amp;v=uaahzcer1ji, 
  how come no one mentioned gustav mahler yet ? 
  his compositions are truly epic . 
  6 in a minor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ogpi-mxx8 ), 
  what 's wrong with nato flag ? 
  seriously , i do n't get it :(, 
  well , that 's actually not confirmed yet . 
  shame op did n't mention speculative tone of that article . 
  they just refer to some inside sources , nothing 's official . 
  also the truth is that each of those helis is quite a bad choice - the only one sure and tested construction , s-70 , is a bit too small , according to many experts . 
  on the other hand , caracal and 149 have many frequent technical problems . 
  so yeah , calm down for a moment , wait for army 's statements . 
  well , you can always switch to mandarin and/or japanese . 
  that way you 'd still be ahead of all eu countries in terms of efficency , though . 
  i wonder what would you say , if leaked video would have contained scenes of elderly woman being beaten by those little savages . 
  which was the reason for their arrest . 
  because they 're fucking idiots . 
  i 'm friends with a few engineers of forestry from cracow 's agricultural university and they all agree , that this logging operation is necessary for bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest to ensure it 's survival . 
  vytautas barkauskas is awesome too , i first listened to him during lithuanian days in cracow 's philharmony . 
  103 , super good piece of music !, 
  when i was a kid , i was being told that it 's a gift from my guardian angel . 
  even better than the dragon . 
  i think i finally can stop worryng about the witcher . 
  do n't worry man , koders are funny too . 
  they defend democracy with their fond memories of our communist generals !, 
  [ double dose of fun !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dzezs6p0k0 ), 
   also , apparently its more like 10k people . 
  oh how tables have turned !, 
  listen , i have faith in new government and i really like duda , but such reducing of protesters ' numbers reminds me about similar practices by po-oriented media back when pis was in the opposition . 
  do n't do that , man . 
  but yeah , that whole struggle , although interesting , is nothing to worry about . 
  i mean it could certainly be more polite etc , but it 's nothing new here - those are things that previous ruling party did too - it 's just that media were quiet about it . 
  are you sure that production is plummeting ? 
  i 've heard that we 're actually mining too much coal that no one wants to buy - and that 's why so many of our mines arent profitable . 
  instantly got this [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk1r9kdvfds ) playing in my brain . 
  is it somehow connected ? 
  that would be just another optional exam , just like dance and history of art exams ... 
  i 'd say that today an average pole feels a weird mix of jealousy , admiration , friendliness and pity for our western neighbours . 
  i 'd explain jealousy with a popular sentence , that can be heard sometimes - `` germans actually did n't lost the war , just look at them now '' . 
  and the same way of thinking , just with different attitude , makes us admire you . 
  friendliness would come from the feeling that now `` we 're all good '' - you apologized over and over again , so much that it became embarassing . 
  also russia 's attitude in this area helps you being perceived as a genuinely good guys . 
  i mean nowadays , of course . 
  and pity - that 's because of influx of the immigrants , who are disdained by the poles above anything else . 
  personally , germans make up for one of the largest portions of my foreign friends , and i must say that hanging out with them is always a blast . 
  at least as long as i do n't throw jokes about holocaust . 
  that 's awesome . 
  let 's hope it 's going to evolve into something bigger , serious competition with a base similar to f1 's , with teams of constructors , pilots and pretty girls with umbrellas . 
   `` my legs did n't hurt , '' he told bfmtv . 
  `` my arms hurt but that 's because of rheumatism . '', 
  an absolute madman . 
  i 'm almost sure korean elections will be held [ a lot sooner ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-impeachment.html ) . 
  modern reinterpretation of old polish tale about [ wawel dragon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wawel_dragon ) has been finally released . 
  directed by our famous tomasz bagi\u0144ski , i think r/europe 's going to like it . 
  [ legends of poland .
