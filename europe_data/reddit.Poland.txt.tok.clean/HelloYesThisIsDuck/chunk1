what would private cars do with saunas ? 
  that was the first thing i thought of !, 
  huh , i always thought the swedes were crazy about hockey . 
  oh well , thanks !, 
  latvia is one of only 3 countries in the world , along with canada and finland , where ice hockey is the most popular type of sport . 
  wait , what 's the most popular sport in / r/sweden and / r/russia ? 
  ^ ok ^ in ^ russia ^ it ^ might ^ be ^ drinking ^ but ^ can ^ it ^ not ^ be ^ hockey ^ in ^ sweden ? 
  pole here . 
  i do not like the way certain people phrase it ( i.e. 
  polish concentration camps ) , but it is dumb to deny that it was , in fact , in poland . 
  then again , only an idiot would confuse * concentration camps built in poland * with * polish-run concentration camps * , so the whole thing is blown out of proportion , imo . 
  we are a bit backwards . 
  to be fair , [ this is his idea of `` art '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xrflian.jpg ) . 
  pretty sure that qualifies as hate speech in many countries . 
  no , but the snp won all their seats in scotland , afaik , and they only have 9 % of the seats . 
  proportionally to the population , it might be a lot , but it 's not so bad . 
  they should if the other party is the ukip haha . 
  seriously , the system in canada is similar , and it does suck when you have a shitty party like the conservatives in majority with 36 % of the vote , but what can you do ? 
  the snp had an overwhelming majority in scotland . 
  the ukip might have gotten 12.5 % of the vote , but that still means 7/8 of the population does not want them in power . 
  it 's easy to make it sound so ridiculous , but considering the population of scotland accounts for ~ 8.3 % of the uk , 5 % of the vote for the snp is a pretty decisive victory for them , is n't it ? 
  i noticed the same thing in tunisia ... 
  most salesmen at the souks try to be friendly , and develop some sense of connection with the tourists . 
  with tunisia and morocco being french colonies/protectorates , many emigrants from those countries migrate to france rather than england . 
  that is not to say that they are all lying , maybe they * are * all being honest ; i 'd just take it with a grain of salt . 
  it 's insane how quickly people forgot about turkey being a model democracy in the middle-east , and how you guys were on track to join the eu before erdogan . 
  we can prove we hate russia !, 
  ( note that i have nothing against * russians * , just hate their government ), 
  lithuania + +, 
  people here , kurwa , like to say , kurwa , it is kurwa the hardest of languages kurwa , and kurwa they are proud of it kurwa !, 
  just the ttip . 
  that report was clearly dictated by the eu . 
  you mean make them more retarded ? 
  pronounced '' ~ ~ va fanculo ~ ~ vaffanculo fascisti '' ( sorry if i butchered this , i do n't actually speak italian ),

  first and foremost , i think rioja , cava , and other amazing wines !, 
  a nuclear-armed petrostate with a mentally unstable despotic leader . 
  umsonst :p edit : taken from google translate . 
  antibiotics , and i imagine opiates , and tons of other drugs require a prescription . 
  i 'm not a pharmacist , so i do n't know the exact details , and i have no need for viagra , so i do n't know how it works , exactly , but yeah ... go to a pharmacy and you can get it over the counter . 
  i only know about it , because there was a bunch of articles mentioning it when they were working on making the morning after pill prescription only . 
  we 're doing it backwards from pretty much the rest of europe , and feminist groups started mocking the government saying that you can see what problems our politicians have , and why the little blue pill is readily available . 
  yeah , it 's the pro lifers/anti choice government 's idea of how to treat women . 
  poland has problems with a shrinking population , since so many people go work in richer , western countries , and they think forcing women to get pregnant is the solution ... ( i guess abstinence is an option , but let 's be honest ; that just does n't work ) . 
  buy viagra without a prescription . 
  now they want ( or did ? ), 
  to prohibit selling the * day after * pill without a prescription . 
   had to fact check this and ~ ~ yep , apparently it 's legal . ~ ~ now you 're on a list . 
  brewing ! = distilling . 
  it is my understanding you can make wine/beer at home in poland , but distillation is illegal . 
   some older people are using their debit cards just to withdraw money from atms . 
  great , now i feel old .

   they decided they can do it themselves ( think it 's a couple ) , little by little , whenever they can afford it and whenever inspiration strikes sounds like my neighbour . 
  been doing renovations for at least the last 4 years . 
  when i renovated my flat , i hired a crew , and sure , there was a lot of noise and dust and shit , but that only lasted a couple of months . 
  fuck that guy . 
  old commie apartment building . 
  i can hear my upstairs neighbours when they do renovations , or when they drop shit on the floor . 
  they used to make a ** lot ** of noise , late into the night - i could hear loud music late into the night . 
  their daughter moved out , and it 's been quiet-ish since . 
  i can hear one next-door neighbour 's pipes rattle when she uses hot water , for some reason . 
  neighbour on the other side was recently listening to loud techno , but that was the only time i ever heard music/noise from their place , so i really do n't mind . 
  i am probably the loudest neighbour on my floor ( music , netflix , and xbox ) , though i do n't go out of my way to make a huge racket ... 
  i do hear people in the hallway , usually . 
  i need a new door . 
  when i renovated my flat , i also insulate the floor better . 
  warmer , and i hopefully bother the neighbour downstairs less . 
  i have hardcore french-speaking friends in quebec , and even then , most of them use pcs in english . 
  french for an os is just weird . 
  there once was a polish pope who said communism 's a joke so the people told the commies `` nope '' and they give their manhoods a stroke while they dream of his face it 's a bloody disgrace thanks john paul 2 you big fat dope . 
  i ca n't poet , but yeah ... basically , polish pope set us back 400 years or so . 
  stupidly religious . 
  i think organized religion is pretty much organized crime . 
  too many of them abuse children , they do n't pay taxes , they get involved in politics , even though they should n't . 
   my favourite post haha , god damn , that is glorious . 
  i now * really * want to visit ireland . 
  you 're also bound to get hit by a pis minister going 100-150 kph . 
  one thing i find really interesting is how each country adapts the music to their local styles . 
  for instance , cumbia from colombia , chile or mexico will often sound pretty different . 
  you 're right . 
  had another listen and it switches around halfway through the song . 
  do n't tell my punk friends , but i love that song . 
  spanish edit : never mind ... ca n't listen to this version ( banned wherever i route my traffic ) , but yeah , it appears to switch to portuguese around half-way through the song . 
  [ kortatu - zu atrapatu arte ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlkwvvcyta0 ) in basque , [ popperklopper - gewalt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evez54flqow ) in german , but if you want some real wtf , estonia 's [ winny puhh - `` meiecundimees \u00fcks korsakov l\u00e4ks eile l\u00e4tti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dllo85zsuk ) . 
  biggest problem is that i do n't speak any klingon , so people immediately know i am faking it . 
  from a quick google search , should be easily found in any supermarket , though i 've never looked for it myself . 
  * les bines * , french-canadian for * beans * , is a very quebeccer thing . 
  i would think it 's something the netherlands picked up from canada rather than the other way around , unless you were already eating that in the early 1800s . 
  maple syrup is basically one of the staples of quebec 's cuisine . 
  what country are you from ? 
  canada has them too . 
  i can get some at tesco in poland , even in a small town . 
  it 's kind of pricey though . 
  do n't think it 's very popular here , though . 
  france , being closer to quebec ( in terms of culture ) might consume more , i do n't know . 
  what kind of syrup ? 
  if it 's maple , it sounds more like something canadians would have imported to nl rather than the other way around . 
  sounds like polish [ * nalewka * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nalewka ) .
