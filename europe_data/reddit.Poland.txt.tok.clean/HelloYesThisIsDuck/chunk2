  except we use 95 % spirit to make it . 
  end results for cherry is typically around 45 % abv ( for homemade stuff ) . 
  if you make it with honey instead of cherries , aka miod\u00f3wka , you can make it a lot stronger ... 70 % is pretty good , 
  mexico city . 
  lived there for 5 years , and it was the coolest place i ever lived !, 
  though i am thinking tallinn for now will be a more realistic destination . 
  i already intend on moving there , for business . 
  i 'm ok with warsaw having tons of skyscrapers . 
  it 's not a pretty city ( suffered too much during ww2 and at other times ) . 
  definitely a nice change from the communist architecture . 
  i sleep in until near dark , then sit in front of the pc all night . 
  kind of easier than during the summer . 
  in the summer , i tend to go out more though . 
  now i 'm hibernating . 
  in terms of becoming authoritarian , yes . 
  in terms of being right-wing , i feel so , but i ca n't be quite sure . 
  in terms of being a european country , eh ... drifting further and further away from the eu . 
  seems like they are deliberately trying to become more of a regional power in the middle east than an integral part of europe . 
   take hungary for example or poland . 
  first they rendered the constitutional tribunal ineffective , now they are trying to change election laws , etc. 
  definitely becoming more and more authoritarian , and cementing their hold on power . 
   the fact , that you are concerned about people with different opinion than yours getting power * democratically * , means to me you are not willing to understand , let alone simply aknowledge , why they think what they think . 
  i 'm also very liberal , and despise our current government , but i have to say ... our pisheads only had 37 % of the vote , and only have a parliamentary majority because of an anomaly - 7.5 % of the vote went to the * united left * coalition and 3.6 % to * partia razem * ( both left-wing , though some will disagree ) and 4.8 % to * korwin * ( right-wing ) , which was below the threshold to enter parliament . 
  thanks to that , their seats were divided amongst the parties that did pass the threshold , and pis has more than half the seats in parliament . 
  now , i 'm not denying that they were democratically elected and that they fairly won free elections ... 
  but that should not give them the right to dismantle democracy in poland , disrregard our consititution , etc. 
  i wo n't bother responding to each and every of op 's points , but i agree with them that the trend is worrying . 
  in terms of standardization , and support , absolutely . 
  i think the eu should work together , * and * with other countries , to support autonomous vehicles . 
  that said , i also do not wish to ban human drivers . 
  driving is fun . 
  perfectly serious . 
  it has its flaws , but it 's the best thing that ever happened to europe . 
  we have more rights , more wealth and higher standards of living , the schengen area makes travelling a breeze , as do the curbs ( and future elimination ) on roaming charges , we have more cultural exchanges , and therefore easier communication , and a long period of stability - even though certain groups like the russian government and other extremist organizations that try hard to destabilize it . 
  too many . 
  german , italian , portuguese , catalan are all in progress , though i have n't worked on any of them in the last month or so . 
  estonian , when i move to estonia . 
  all the ones related to polish ... russian , ukrainian , slovakian , and maybe czech . 
  as long as they are n't too hard . 
  japanese , because it 's an amazing culture , but it might never happen . 
  i 'm just thankful hungarians speak english so well . 
  nope , not that i know of . 
  no text entry . 
  it just says `` europe . '', 
  i can edit *** my *** flair . 
  i ca n't edit yours . 
  in this post , it does n't matter , but if the post title says i.e. 
  `` what do you dislike about your country ? '', 
  and you answer `` the food '' ... 
  i already imagine you are from europe . 
  but i have no idea which country 's food you dislike . 
  which is why i use the eu flag in / r/europe ( i do love the eu ) and the polish one here - it just makes answers about my country clearer . 
  i sort of wish it were n't here , because then you have people answering questions and you do n't know what country they are from , and what country the answer refers to . 
  not me , but a friend of a friend once asked my belgian friend `` parles-tu belgicien ? '', 
  ( do you speak belgician ? 
  - and no , it is not a real word ) . 
  funny , i 've thought that about a spanish singer at first , when i lived in mexico . 
  that weird spanish 's ' pronunciation . 
  not only that , we are sort of not on the best of terms with russia . 
  i suggest erasing the southern countries instead . 
  the baltic is freaking cold . 
   poland : i 've found them ( based solely on internet chats ) to be very xenophobic and racist and hardcore in the bad sense of the word . 
  i thought russians were bad but poland is like ` russians on coke ' . 
  no argument from me : /, 
  i do n't watch tv either , but i think [ * \u015awiat wed\u0142ug kiepskich * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awiat_wed%c5%82ug_kiepskich ) would be close . 
   the show follows the life of a dysfunctional polish family from wroc\u0142aw , who live in an old apartment in wroc\u0142aw on 3/4 \u0106wiartki street ( in polish \u0106wiartka means 1/4 but it often refers to 1/4 of a litre bottle of vodka ) . 
  most episodes are centered on ferdynand kiepski , who tries to make various schemes to improve his financial or life situation , all of which ultimately fail . 
  the series parodies the dynamics of polish families in a style similar to that of the us series married ... with children , released in poland as \u015awiat wed\u0142ug bundych ( the world according to the bundys ) ; in many ways it inverts the dynamics of the bundys . 
  in many ways it is also inspired by the simpsons . 
  * it is the second longest comedy tv series in the world after the simpsons ( 561 episodes ) . 
  * huh , til . 
  blasphemy laws ( laws against offending other people 's religious feelings - kodeks karny article 196 ) , and the laws against tarnishing poland 's name ( kk article 133 ) , insulting foreign heads of state ( kk article 136 , \u00a7 3 ) , or the president ( kk art . 
  in the us , if you were to say the president is a child molester , you could get sued for libel . 
  if you say he 's an asshole , your opinion is protected by the constitution . 
  if you burn a flag , it 's protected by the constitution . 
  in poland , you post [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rzoo5_m9lm ) on facebook as a joke , and the police come and seize your computer . 
  ( granted , the kid was n't charged , but still ) . 
  and who knows , maybe no one will arrest you for calling erdogan a dictator , but they theoretically could . 
  also , christians can tell you you 'll burn in hell for eternity , but do n't you dare make fun of them for saying it . 
  kind of hypocritical . 
  i disagree with the selective right not to be offended . 
  ps : i realize this is n't only a polish phenomenon , but i do find those laws archaic . 
  for sure , but the impunity and ease with which our ruling party is destroying the constitutional tribunal is worrying . 
  edit : and thinking about what they may do once they are done dismantling it is even scarier . 
  nothing , as i mostly grew up outside europe . 
  the bigger shock for me is how limited freedom of speech is in poland , and the fragility of our democracy . 
  it 'll probably be mine , because i am moving to estonia . 
  `` donne mo\u00e9 ton cash mon osti dc\u00f4lisse '' would be more likely . 
  i 've been a few times in eastern and western canada , and mexico . 
  they are a fairly common sight in north america . 
  i 'm relatively short for poland . 
  do n't really care ... 
  it 's just an occasional inconvenience when i go to shows . 
  i know a couple of brothers who are both more than 2 metres tall ... 
  i really look up to them . 
   how do you refer to teachers/professors ? 
  as `` soon to be unemployed . '', 
  thanks , pis government / needless education reform . 
  seafood , pizza , and seafood pizza . 
  i 'd add great beers to germany and czechia , you can drink anywhere in germany , and you can smoke weed in czechia .
