  those are nice traits too . 
  illegal in poland as well , outside of populated areas ( marked with [ this sign ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/znak_d-43.svg/413px-znak_d-43.svg.png ) ) . 
  i think it 's a 100 z\u0142oty fine ( ~ $ 22 ) . 
  i shot a bb gun once . 
  i have touched real guns , in a house , though i have n't shot it , as it was n't exactly owned legally ( that was in another country , outside europe ) . 
  i probably should n't have left my fingerprints on it :p, 
  many polish people buy used cars in germany ( especially ) , netherlands , etc. 
  sometimes they are imported and sold , some people make the trip . 
  aside from that , there are many shops selling german cleaning products , and sweets . 
  i do n't really know of anybody travelling for non-car purchases , but i live pretty far from any border . 
  some people buy russian / ukrainian cigarettes , as they are much cheaper , but those are usually smuggled in without paying taxes . 
  i really do n't know our history well , but i like the recreation of the [ battle of grunwald ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald ) ... 
  they have a medieval fair , with [ knight fights ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiahek9f3yy ) ( they are pretty hardcore ) , followed by hundreds of people ( and a number of horses ) recreating the battle . 
  classical polish ginger bread . 
  i prefer the chocolate coated kind . 
  if you 're outside the eu , you might have to visit a polish store , if that is an option , as i am not sure they ship internationally . 
  if you * do * visit a polish store , i suggest getting makowiec , too . 
  poppy-seed cake < 3, 
  we have [ ptasie mleczko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ptasie_mleczko ) in poland . 
  it looks similar , but it 's milk , not curds . 
  i 'll have to try * kohuke * one day . 
  same , pizza and kebab . 
  when nationalists eat kebab , people sometimes make it into memes [ like this ] ( http://img.sadistic.pl/pics/614d8f346514.jpg ) . 
  ( t-shirt says `` death to our fatherland 's enemies '' and the caption says `` when you need to visit a turk to regain your strength from a kebab , to keep fighting the fatherland 's enemies . '' ), 
   latvians do like hockey , no clue if they are good . 
  [ they 're 12th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iihf_world_ranking#men.27s_rankings ) according to the iihf rankings . 
   you 're right , we have limitations of drug ( ab - ) use that some countries do n't have . 
  to be fair , treating it as a criminal problem and not a health problem ** is ** backwards and retarded . 
   but how easy it is to get high/drunk ? 
  it 's still easy to get high . 
  except they can throw you in jail for 3 years for doing it , here . 
  not judging , because as far as drug laws go , we are the most retarded country in the eu ( i often think of poland as the catholic saudi arabia ) , but i agree with / u/prasiatko . 
  while most people do view our ruling party as right-wing ( myself included ) due to their association to the catho-taliban church , and their nationalism , they also implement some socialist elements , such as child benefits , and they want to have universal health care for all poles before 2018 , not currently , which only covers workers ( and their families , i believe ) and retirees . 
  you could call them national-socialists , but they are not 100 % right-wing . 
   the real black friday in the uk is the friday before christmas where people go out and get drunk . 
  blackout friday , or as we call it in poland , every day . 
  - what 's the attitude to cremation in your country ? 
  i 've never talked about it with anyone , except for my dad , so i would n't know . 
  many people are very traditional , and by law , you have to bury the ashes in a cemetery . 
  there are crematoriums in many cities , so i imagine they * do * have customers , but probably in the minority . 
  - what are graveyards like ? 
  very well maintained . 
  - are any foods or drinks specifically associated with funerals ? 
  none come to mind . 
  vodka ( well , not * at * the funeral , obviously ) . 
  have n't been to many . 
  last one there was the funeral , lunch at one of those rooms you can rent , with catering ( typical , meaty food ) , then we went to drink at a family member 's house , with leftovers being served , and sandwiches . 
  - how often do you visit graves of relatives ? 
  personally , couple of times a month in the summer . 
  some people go weekly , some even more often than that . 
  as i mentioned , they are very well maintained , so most people go clean up leaves , rip out weeds ( or salt the earth ) , was the tombstones , etc. 
  on november 1st ( wszystkich \u015awi\u0119tych - all saints ' day ) , everyone brings flowers , candles , etc. 
  [ they are extremely picturesque then . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  i know religion was a bit more taboo in my dad 's time ( baby boomers ) , due to the communists trying to get rid of it . 
  then i was under the impression that after/under the polish pope , everyone turned back saying `` oh , he saved us from communism and religion is great . '', 
  ( but then , i was raised in canada , so i do n't have a typical polish perspective . ), 
  never even did my first communion . 
  one day i will go and become an apostate . 
  it [ sounds simple ] ( http://apostazja.info/index.php/procedura-b/procedura-wystapienia ) , though i am sure the priests will be reluctant lol, 
   being religious ( except for old people , they can be religios ) or hard atheist is frown upon are you in a bigger city ? 
  in a smaller one , i 'd say being atheist is frowned upon , being religious is very normal even for young adults . 
  i have family in their 20s who go to church weekly , and many people who are very religiously active . 
  at least one of them , because of health problems . 
  they live in a smaller city , though . 
  in bigger cities i am sure it 's different . 
  [ most chewing gum and candy are american owned . 
  all the big soft drinks . 
  many brands of chips ( crisps ) . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/i6acq4d.jpg ) see also [ this list of american conglomerates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_conglomerates#united_states ) . 
  as for the original question , i do n't really buy many american conglomerate to begin with , and i am not yet certain whether i will boycott them or not . 
  with the amount i am buying , it wo n't make much of a difference . 
   the people who say this are the same who say meat causes cancer to be fair , most scientists believe [ red meat and processed meats increase risks of cancer ] ( https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/21639/cancer-information/cancer-risk-and-prevention/healthy-weight-diet-and-exercise/meat-and-cancer/ ) . 
  our vodka is pretty good !, 
  the choice to have an abortion or not should be up to the parents , not to some old dudes . 
  anyone who opposes abortions should n't have abortions . 
  anyone who feels they need one should have access to them . 
  healthcare should cover it , imo . 
  most people in poland are happy with the compromise , with it being only legal in cases of rape , or risk to the baby 's or the mother 's life . 
  i 'd like to see more liberalization , but it will take years . 
  atheism , tolerance , weed , bureaucracy , health care , etc. 
  seeing the retarded energy policy in some countries in central/eastern europe , i fell it 's not my place to comment : /, 
  i get enough interaction with polish people irl for my liking . 
  offline , most of them are not too bad . 
  behind the pseudo-anonymity of the internet , however , everyone 's a goddamn troll . 
  i read local news in polish , and occasionally read the polish wikipedia for polish history , or read recipes in polish . 
  i try to avoid the polish sections of facebook ( except for clubs/venues/festivals / etc. ), 
  because the people often make it intolerable . 
  i do subscribe to / r/polska , and occasionally post links , or comments , but it 's not my most active sub . 
  many of the redditors are nice , and have a more modern mentality . 
  careful , or we have at least two villages/towns called * baby * you can end up in . 
  so reading it as szkoda in polish is ok then ... good to know , 
  freezer-cold . 
  optionally with apple juice . 
  poland was never part of the ussr , but under their influence , so yes , still plenty of old communist blocks . 
  mine is pretty solid , at least . 
  most people renovate them . 
  in the winter , you do n't hear all * that * much . 
  the eu is helping pay for thermal isolation , so they are n't as cold as they used to be . 
  not luxurious , but it 's not a bad way to live , on the cheap .
