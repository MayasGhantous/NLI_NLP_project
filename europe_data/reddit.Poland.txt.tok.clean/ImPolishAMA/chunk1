you would n't believe how little the vast majority of poles care about vilnius and lviv . 
  trust me , almost nobody here wants these cities back . 
  only the nationalist minority does . 
  and i 'm absolutely sure you can find germans who 'd love to see breslau , posen and stettin back in their country . 
  this is a similar kind of sentiment and similarly serious . 
  and polish football fans tend to be very interested in history , unlike most young poles . 
  [ apparently we have many different opinions as my map is n't very similar to the ones posted by other poles ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f6a0s5w.png ), 
  i 'm just curious : why mixed feelings about poland ? 
  is it the car thiefs ? 
  cheap labor ? 
  well , [ my s\u0142owianie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ) was very popular recently , as well as [ ona ta\u0144czy dla mnie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvxg3zl_whu ) . 
  both have english language versions but do n't bother listening . 
  i had to check ( i do n't listen to polish contemporary pop since it 's absolutely horrible ) : [ anna wyszkoni - biegnij przed siebie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gmiulsk6pw ) ( it sounds very similar to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_rq6dizqzy ) for me ), 
  just what the russians would want to bomb in case of a world war iii, 
  no , they definitely are not useful for tourism unless you want to spend a bit more money . 
  of course that 's what i meant . 
  it 's a nazi camp on polish soil . 
  it 's one of the more popular destinations for tourists coming to poland ( some even come here only to go to auschwitz and then leave the country ) and it 's only here because we had a large jewish population and were a country that the nazis attacked . 
  but krak\u00f3w ( cracow ) is more of a tourist destination . 
  you 're right , some still do . 
  but it should n't be * the * stereotype of poles . 
  yup . 
  it 's not even polish !, 
  to many people there is only western europe ( the good europe ) and eastern europe ( bad , poor , not as * european * as rich western countries ), 
  poland is not a nation of thieves , as many people in germany or scandinavia still believe . 
  we are normal europeans who had to live in a very hostile environment for decades . 
  first we got invaded by two countries and then had a horrible political system instated here by the soviets . 
  during the 45 years of communism in poland many habits that formed during the war were strenghtened . 
  you were forced to do everything you could to get food on your table . 
  on the other hand , there was not much of value in the country ( apart from the people , of course ) . 
  this is why many poles went to western and northern countries and stole cars or worked for peanuts . 
   an entire ideology , buildt on solidarity , fraternity and full equality the ideology may have been designed with a basis of these but the actual result of it simply must have been crooked in every possible way . 
  and it was . 
  it 's probably [ what kozakiewicz showed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn0in1fzqoi ) to the russian crowd actively discouraging him during the 1980 summer olympics in moscow . 
  for a nation under the communist rule installed here by the soviets this must have felt awesome . 
  i 'm glad you liked europe . 
  come by soon , 
  she learned the truth . 
  she died recently , i think last year . 
  it reminds me of this debate from [ ali g indahouse ] ( https://youtu.be/j9isvp18rq0?t=21m ), 
   title says he went to the countryside ? 
  no , it says * the president is sailing to the country * . 
  the word * country * is used in the sense of * his native country * . 
  the polish term for * the country * / * the countryside * is * wie\u015b * . 
  the plane crash happened on april 10 , when their mother was in a bad condition . 
  she had been very ill for a long time . 
  the page from the newspaper is from the beginning of may suggesting a rather long period of hiding the news from her . 
  these views , each one from a different country , are remarkably similar to what we have here in poland . 
  europe is a lot more homogenous than i thought . 
  this is the danish presenter . 
  stunning nature ? 
  check . 
  a nice car ? 
  check . 
  a wooden house ? 
  check . 
  yup , scandinavia . 
  on a nice day : 15 minute walk , 20 minute bus ride or 5 minute walk , 10 minute bus ride depending on which of the two places ( branches of my company ) i work in i have to go to on that day . 
  on a bad day the first type of commute looks like this : 5 minute walk , 10 minute bus ride then another 20 minute bus ride [ the bus looks like this ] ( http://galeria.solaris-club.com/data/media/19/p1020554.jpg ) and the streets it rides on are really unimpressive , sadly . 
  no reason to post a link to google maps . 
  it 's always pronounced as `` h '' in polish . 
  so , who did it ? 
  that 's not very funny . 
  in fact , it 's not funny at all . 
  you do n't seem to be getting his irony . 
  unless it 's some sort of an irony pyramid and you hide yours too well . 
  taste it !, 
  taste it , i say !, 
  well that 's the way it is all over the world . 
  it 's not unique to any specific country . 
   `` this guy is rich but his mom/dad is living in the streets !! '', 
  these were common in poland a few years ago but i guess our celebrities learned the hard way that you should keep your family in good financial state because otherwise your image can hurt . 
  in our rather conservative society it is also frowned upon if an older man gets a divorce and marries a younger woman . 
  by frowned upon i mean guys say `` nice ... '' while women say `` ugh '' but still buy these tabloids/read the news . 
  we also have internet celebrity news sites . 
  the most popular is [ pudelek.pl ] ( http://www.pudelek.pl/ ) that came under fire a few months ago when they reported about the death of a polish celebrity anna przybylska . 
  she was n't dead then but her battle with cancer was reported by the media . 
  she died a few weeks later . 
  i 've heard of it but have never heard it . 
  thanks for your recommendation !, 
   a 15 year old girl who ran away from a child welfare center was raped by two cops . 
  oh come on !, 
  exactly . 
  [ my face upon seeing this title ] ( http://data.whicdn.com/images/10583381/original.jpg ) some people really do n't seem to get how much the russian have hurt poland over the centuries . 
  okay , what the fuck did i just read . 
  the taste of freedom, 
  i absolutely love the sound of swedish . 
  i do n't speak the language but i listen to sveriges radio online because it sounds nice and helps me relax on weekends . 
  i also listen to it during my long walks . 
  i 'm being serious . 
  other than that , i also like the sound of german ( i do n't find it rough like a lot of people ) . 
  my favorite apart from swedish is portuguese though . 
  it sounds like spanish with french pronunciation . 
  a sweet language ( as the spanish call it ) indeed . 
  the only language that annoys me is dutch , with this horrible `` khkhkhkh '' sound . 
  i remember there was a shooting in an american elementary school or a pre-school and these people with microphones who work on tv ( because this is a [ journalist ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/george_orwell_press_photo.jpg ) ) were asking children about the shooting the same day it happened . 
   in 2010 a plane crashed leaving one survivor : a 9-year-old dutch boy . 
  de telegraaf called him up soon after the crash for an interview and published the interview with the boy 's full name classy . 
  this room could literally be anywhere in europe , or at least the eu . 
  do n't you think ?
