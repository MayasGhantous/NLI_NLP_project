   the kremlin does n't seem to realize it though . 
  oh , you can be sure they do . 
  what the fuck . 
  i 'm scared :(, 
  cartoons are probably the only consistently good thing that the communist bloc produced . 
  they were designed to be shown in many countries so they have almost no dialogue , they are designed also for very young kids ( no violence at all ) . 
  the lack of dialogues also makes them easy to follow for a very young child . 
  i 'm as anti-communist as one can be but i admit - cartoons in the communist times were really good . 
  this is my favorite rendition of this song . 
  better than the original . 
  this is just beautiful . 
  yup , i guess we 're not that bad . 
   a school teacher in bavaria was fined more than 12,000 eur for giving students electric shocks and making racist remarks . 
  the shocks were so powerful that one student had blisters on his hands and needed to be treated in a hospital . 
  most of the fine is for the allegation of incitement of the people - he called a blue-eyed blonde student an `` aryan '' and told a student with czech origin that he belonged to `` an inferior race '' . 
  what . 
  the . 
  wow . 
  that 's kind of late , is n't it ? 
   new unique emergency number is it not going to be 112 ? 
   around 20 kids - aged 5 ( ! ), 
  to 13 - trashed a kindergarden . 
  something tells me ( i do n't know why ! ), 
  that it was n't a 5-year-old 's idea . 
  also , what is a 5-year-old doing outside at 7pm ? 
  it 's really scary how impressionable young children are and how much they want to imitate what they see older kids and adults do . 
  ** poland : ** - [ we have a new president !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrzej_duda ) - loans taken in chf in recent years will be changed to pln loans based on the exchange rate on the day of signing the contract . 
  - lech pozna\u0144 failed to qualify for the champions league , making it 20 years since we last had a team in this competition . 
  - heat waves , luckily no large amount of deaths reported . 
  [ too soon ] ( http://digart.img.digart.pl/data/img/vol3/48/40/miniaturki400/3310363.jpg ), 
  let us light candles for the victims : [ * ], 
  i do n't drink , really . 
  i honestly do n't know what to think . 
  i like the wooden path on the border between germany and poland . 
  it looks so ... well , peaceful . 
  and it actually looks nice , it is n't just some boards put together so you have something to walk on . 
  kind of minimalist and unobtrusive in that setting . 
  it is never going to happen . 
  the players would have to want this and for them it 's like christmas , except it happens every 4 years . 
  wow , this is literally exactly what i wanted to write . 
  you think i do n't know that ? 
  i 'd be glad if warsaw replaced paris in this relationship, 
  i think it 's only an approximate map . 
  remember about the planned [ * ygrek * line . 
  that 's how it is for all european countries , i think . 
  as a teacher , articles . 
  we do n't have them in polish . 
  also , the phrase `` there is/are '' seems to be confusing to all of my students . 
  if there is germany , there should also be poland . 
  and if there is france there should also be austria and switzerland . 
  also , no benelux . 
  is it a woman 's scarf above the right front wheel of the [ car ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bnbwicv.jpg ) ? 
  so horrible . 
  you know , someone will have to buy these cars first . 
  not everyone can afford them . 
  shots fired ( hopefully only in the metaphorical sense ), 
  yes but it has a long history . 
  no , it is not . 
  do you speak polish ? 
   `` murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 '' - being-like-a-black-guy absolutely not . 
  submisiveness would be the word , i guess . 
  submisiveness related to low self-esteem . 
  the word * murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 * comes from the word * murzyn * which is an old term for a black person ( not an equivalent of the n word ) . 
  in official documents it is `` kr\u00f3lestwo niderland\u00f3w '' but nobody uses this term and many not even know it exists . 
  `` holandia '' is the regular term for the country . 
   allegro.pl is usually quite cheap too , you know of course but not for books in english . 
  really ? 
  that 's great !, 
  thanks !, 
  well , that 's the problem . 
  you do n't have to pay any customs fees when buying in an eu-based online store . 
  probably the most well known chess player in the world . 
   kasparov he 's untouchable . 
  putin or anyone from his clique would not dare kill him , i think . 
  but maybe i 'm overestimating their humanity . 
  i 'm worried by the word * heritage * here . 
  remember communism was installed here by the soviets . 
  what about it ? 
  we have a full range of sizes here , i guess . 
  afaik the official name of the country , used in formal contexts ( official correspondence etc ) is kr\u00f3lestwo niderland\u00f3w - the kingdom of the netherlands . 
   if you believe god exists it means you 're religious . 
  no it does n't . 
   98 % of polish people are religious that is not true at all , i assure you . 
  besides , we 'd have to define what * being religious * even is . 
  but even then , the percentage would not be this large . 
  [ we do n't really drink much compared to other european countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita ) and we are not all that religious . 
  do n't worry . 
  yes . 
  yes it does . 
  in fact , all of the songs from their recent album were put on [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl0noys6u_lfst9gz3i3pbrqgkoxds-hkq ) and they all have at least 600 000 views each , with most having at least a million views . 
  it is not making headlines ( we have a presidential election on sunday ) but i 've read about it . 
  you have an interesting account history . 
   placek po w\u0119giersku - hungarian pancacke ( called also ` placek po cyga\u0144sku ' - gypsy pancake ) - potato pancake with gulash . 
  i 've also seen the name * jad\u0142o drwala * ( lumberjack 's food ) used for this . 
  til albania is a nato member . 
  maybe i 'm old-fashioned but i do n't see why i would want to pay a premium price for 4g internet . 
  and when it comes to smartphone usage i do n't see why would i need more than 3gb per month . 
  at home i have a 12 megabit internet access and do n't really use it . 
  i could easily do with a 2 mbit one .
