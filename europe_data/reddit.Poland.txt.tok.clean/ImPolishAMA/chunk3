  i also have access to lte but i just do n't need it . 
  i feel old . 
  i 'm not really into beer but i like the mild taste of heineken or guiness . 
  on the other hand , i really did n't like carlsberg when i tried it . 
  this link only proves my point . 
  only potatoes are 6 times as expensive as the same stuff in poland . 
  i know what you mean . 
  funnily enough , i neither drink nor smoke . 
  how much does renting an apartment cost ? 
  nothing fancy or in an affluent area , just any single-room flat in a medium-sized city . 
  it absolutely blows my mind that on avergae you can earn six times as much money in norway as in poland . 
  yet another foreign report on this issue . 
  i 've seen maybe two articles or reports about this in the polish media . 
  this * really * is not a big deal over here . 
  move on , nothing to see here . 
  i wonder what would happen if basic income was introduced and if prices really would shoot through the roof or would it all just even out quickly . 
  how can you love russia in our times while not being russian yourself ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  the czech republic in the german group ? 
  i guess they 'd like that but it 's incorrect in every sense . 
  [ she is beautiful though . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/anna_chapman_mug_shot.jpg ) it 's always easier for beautiful people to become celebrities , especially if they are in the spotlight . 
   the baltics is in nato . 
  yup , that 's what keeps things in check , i think . 
  but if it turned out that russia attacked the baltics and the rest of nato did nothing ... then it would be scary . 
  really , really scary . 
  it would be the end of the world as we know it . 
  i 'm starting to like the idea of the eu army . 
  i have to admit ours is the most distinctive here . 
  i do n't like it at all but i guess it 's going to stay there forever . 
  and that shard building in london is just hideous . 
  i like turning torso in sweden the most . 
  now , this ... 
  this is the future leader . 
  i would be honored to die under his command . 
  this is a map of prejudice so i 'll let most of the map slide but i really do n't see why would anyone call the swiss weird here . 
  i mentally associate them with very tolerant ( if you know what i mean ) banks or watches . 
  [ popek - dirty diana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6z-gsqljjk ) - except for the title and a quote from `` i fink u freeky '' , the song is in polish . 
  and how did that go ? 
  because it could tell you what you should focus on instead of annoying/offending christians . 
  can you imagine a gay envoy to an arabic country ? 
  i wish they were this ballsy when dealing with some other religions . 
  i can only accept it when i 'm * absolutely * sure that if poland gets invaded by russia every single german , frenchman and englishman will ** know ** that ** their ** country got invaded . 
  which is probably never . 
  i guess that eu or some other union eventually will become one federalized country but it will not happen in this century . 
  i 'm being serious about this prediction . 
  finland is the least interesting , i guess . 
  and the baltics . 
  [ so how do you say `` twelve months '' in estonian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sgqsgo6.gif ) ? 
  you first present french , british and german armies as relevant to poland 's safety . 
  they are not . 
  maybe if you consider them a part of nato . 
  then yes . 
  but let 's face it , when you think about nato , the german army is not the first one to come to your mind . 
  and i just do n't believe in french or british soldiers dying for poland 's safety . 
  and then you start talking about polish history having presented three countries : france , great britain and germany . 
  now , tell me : do * you * know poland 's history ? 
  especially the recent one , with wwii obviously being the most important event ? 
   french + british + german ... 
  they count for nothing ? 
   especially considering poland 's history, 
  sweden , norway , germany , denmark . 
  in this order . 
   18 $ / month public broadcasting fees :o, 
  according to wikipedia white represents purity and red represents fire , blood and , in the spiritual sense , valor . 
   we promise them a better economy , protection from russia and the european dream ( which , like any `` dream '' is pretty much a lie , the west is far , far from perfect ) and they threaten them with utter destruction , who would want the very people who bully you as an ally ? 
  i could never get that . 
  how can you * want * to be allied with russia ? 
  what do you actually get from that apart from short-term deals on gas ? 
  i 'm polish ( duh ! ), 
  and literally every single time i 've heard about these militias or training etc. 
  was from a foreign source . 
  i do n't think it would be a reason for an all-out war for ** the eu as an entity ** . 
  the fact that it would be a nato country would be a lot more important . 
  if you look at the map of central europe you 'll see that we are bordered by a number of countries , including a small portion of russia . 
  i 'd much , much rather prefer having americans here than russians . 
  and i specifically talk about these two nations because , let 's face it , germany and france would n't rush to help us in case of an invasion . 
  they 'd express their disapproval or something like that . 
  whatever that would make them look like they care . 
  sadly the southern countries are too weak military-wise to form a bloc that could fight russia . 
  so it 's americans . 
  and it 's not that bad , to be honest . 
  if i had to ask for military help , americans would be an obvious choice every single time . 
   also to polan , how are the mraps ? 
  :d i 'm not really sure what you refer to . 
  do you mean our brand-new cutting-edge super-duper-futuristic-looking [ pl-01 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl-01 ) ? 
   poland is a very religious country , especially people living in the countryside ( the decorated crosses near the road ! ) . 
  well , yes . 
  generally speaking , that 's true . 
  however i think it 's safe to say that the younger the pole , the more probable it is that he/she is not religious at all . 
  what you saw beside roads is called [ przydro\u017cny krzy\u017c ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/krzy%c5%bc_przydro%c5%bcny ) ( try pronouncing that ! ), 
  or [ kapliczka ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapliczka ) . 
  we have literally thousands of them here . 
  a serious question : is it true that most scandinavians need to be drunk to get comfortable talking and hanging out with strangers ? 
  germany ? 
  this joke just goes on and on and on and on, 
  ( pronunciation : smatch-neh-goh ! ), 
  less and less everyday but i will always like our current government less than i like the eu . 
  were n't . 
  it 's those two large elements that jut out of the building , right ?
