  without them the building would be nice but forgettable to many . 
  with them it can be an eyesore to some people . 
  not to me , to be honest although i do admit these two elements could be much shorter . 
  well , it 's not a finished building so it does n't count . 
  swedish !, 
  and portuguese maybe . 
  but swedish . 
  mmmm . 
  poland : pros : i honestly think it 's a safe country . 
  maybe i have a non-punchable face or just mix with the background . 
  i do n't know . 
  but i never feel threatened by anyone . 
  be-a-utiful women . 
  nice nature . 
  people will not consider you a nazi/racist for voicing your negative opinion about immigration or whatever . 
  unless , of course , you are an actual neo-nazi or an ardent racist/antisemite . 
  then people will keep an eye on you . 
  robert lewandowski seems to be getting better and better . 
  cons : not much money compared to countries to the west while having the same prices as them . 
  general rudeness of people in the street , automatic assumption that other people are out to get you/hurt you/rob you in some way . 
  communist-era buildings are ugly . 
  many new buildings are ugly too . 
  the cities are often a mess because of out-of-control advertising that is * everywhere * . 
  not sure if joking, 
  i like it but poland has never been predominantly protestant in any of its parts . 
  also , apparently we are rich now ? 
  cool !, 
  i 'm surprised our number is so high . 
  i 'm being serious . 
  why would they need it ? 
  is there anything bad about going to a school full of immigrants ? 
  i thought denmark is a really progressive country ? 
  why do they have such a racist tool to segregate people ? 
  / s ( or no / s , i 'm confused about this idea ), 
  come to think of it , the worst pubs i 've ever seen here in poland were all flat roof pubs . 
  is this how we can easily spot them all over europe ? 
  certain part of europe . 
  if you do , you should make yourself heard . 
  here in poland there is a vast amount of information about people from western and northern europe who support the influx of immigrants and immigration but those who oppose it are usually mentioned along with neo-nazis and the like . 
  we have both types here in poland but vans seem to be used more often to transport bodies e.g. 
  from accident/hospitals , while hearses are used for funerals, 
  we are above austria , finland , portugal and luxembourg . 
  wow . 
  political views aside , akos was the lead singer in a synthpop band * very , *** very ** clearly inspired by depeche mode . 
  if you 're a fan of dm , give them a listen : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qecjll7jtfy ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrmhszuhjyq ), 
  i do n't see why you 're downvoted . 
  in our times mentioning the bible does n't help you at all when discussing social issues in the media . 
  this is insane . 
  you know , i 've always thought that russians know * perfectly * well what is happening in the world 's economy . 
  they do n't reject it , they just do n't disclose it to the public . 
  instead , they choose to go for their long-term image among the society ( which is extremely isolated from the rest of the world if you think outside st petersburg and moscow ) and politics , pretending to handle the situation they know is getting out of hand . 
  this is short-sighted but lets their leaders remain in power . 
  tl ; dr : it is naive to think that people who came to power in the largest country in the world are stupid . 
  this is amazing . 
  i hoped we would be . 
  lewandowski plays against and with the best german players every week . 
  this is bound to influence his playing style and it can come in handy during the euro . 
  wow , this actually looks quite nice . 
  personally i would open it and make some coffee so we could taste them . 
  i would also assume the rest of it is for me to keep and eat on my own . 
  i 've never thought i would feel sorry for anyone living in france . 
  yet 8000 $ is really low . 
  same in poland . 
  at first i sighed since 16983 $ a year is out of reach for most poles but come to think of it 1415 $ a month must be a really low salary in norway . 
  ah , yes . 
  ireland . 
  you do love to write , do n't you . 
  huh . 
  flow . 
  brb moving to estonia, 
  are they heavy ? 
  i 've never thought of them as uncomfortable because of skin irritation but rather because of their weight . 
  and this is a plausible explanation too . 
  still , the opposition she faces could work as an excuse for her to back down which she still does n't choose to do . 
  my guess is she knows something we do n't and feels horribly guilty . 
  maybe german intelligence did something in syria/middle east that made the situation worse or resulted in deaths of many people ? 
  maybe she feels the west owes the east something ? 
  or she feels she needs to assert her dominance in the german government ? 
  all in all , it 's definitely a personal matter for her at this point . 
  country : poland favourite neighbour : germany least favourite neighbour : russia, 
  this just can not lead to anything good . 
  for the record , any kind of terrorism is ** extremely ** uncommon in poland . 
  hence the false-flag theories since there is an antiterrorism law being designed and discussed right now . 
  in poland it 's more about the value of the land rather than the building which is on it . 
  so very often run-down houses from the 70s can cost well in excess of a million z\u0142otys because they are in a nice place .

  it 's one of the poorest polish cities but the buildings are clean and grass is nice . 
  so i guess it 's the richest part of the poorest polish city .

  that 's a cool map !, 
  has it ever not been a risky endeavor anywhere in the world ? 
  sernik , kie\u0142basa and ( if the picnic was in a country that allowed drinking in public ) some beer, 
  more like poland can into other countries, 
  well , it 's not like a country goes bankrupt over organizing eurovision . 
  even moldova would n't have a problem with it , i think . 
  i started learning english in a more systematic way at the age of 10 . 
  before that i watched english-language cartoons on cartoon network ( we did n't have a polish version of the channel in the 90s ) and i distincly remember watching sesame street and learning how to count to 12 ( not 10 ) because the numbers were put in a song i liked . 
  after i turned 10 i was learning english in a number of ways in addition to that systematic , school education that i mentioned earlier , at first by playing games , then listening to music and finally adding watching films with subtitles to listening to even more english-language songs . 
  the cure , depeche mode , the smiths were my favorites in junior high and they all put heavy emphasis on the lyrics ( especially the smiths ) so i wanted to understand them . 
  for instance , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvdkjjjilse ) song taught me that you can use the phrase `` should n't have + past participle '' to show regret .
