and there 's d'hondt method that favours big parties overall . 
  well , according to constitution it is the ct that decides what is constitutional and their decision is ** final ** , but the government thinks the ct broke the law , therefore their decision is invalid . 
  so right now we have two systems in our increasingly pillarised country : on one hand we have the government and its institutions who refuse to acknowledge ct rulings and therefore function according to the laws they passed . 
  on the other , we have the judiciary and two cities ( tbh idk why they did this , but these are cities controlled by opposition , so the key might be there ) who decided they will follow ct rulings and therefore ignore the laws that were found to be unconstitutional . 
  this will look this way until december , when current head of tribunal leaves it , therefore making his seat vacant . 
  the president appoints a head of this court , which will mean that he 'll pick the partisan that will let those other three judges rule and make current rulings invalid . 
  but again - the president has to choose a head out of proposals given by current judges , therefore either making him choose a person elected by previous government , or more likely , leave the seat vacant , therefore making the tribunal even more dysfunctional . 
  you mean who can make a complaint to the constitutional tribunal ? 
  many institutions , including those in executive ( pm , president ) , legislative ( speakers , 50 mps , 30 senators ) , constitutional offices ( civil rights ombudsman ) , judiciary ( chairperson of supreme court ) , local governments , labour and business unions , churches and citizens ( as limited by a separate law ) . 
  article 191 . 
  do n't forget that the ct law pis passed also included provisions which would have forced the tribunal to rule the cases in the order as they arrived , which coupled with waiting periods means that the government can very easily filibuster the court by sending mundane cases that will have to be ruled on in the order under which they arrived , therefore making the decision-making process way longer . 
  if the law is passed without vacatio legis , it is assumed to be constitutional , so there is no stay and it goes into effect and with this new law it would have taken years before it could have been found to be in breach of the constitution . 
  if only there was an institution that could review this law if it were to be passed ... 
  eastern czechia , i think . 
   no , the situation you described is actually the embodiment of freedom of speech - you can broadcast a movie raw , with 10-minute long commercial breaks each hour , or perhaps with a commentary praising its values , or criticizing its shortcomings . 
  the broadcaster is free to chose the way his programming is presented - and you are free to watch something else instead if you do n't like his offer . 
  making visually misleading captions and running commentary before the movie even begins hurts freedom of speech , as it takes away control over the movie from the author . 
  it 's as if in front of your post created a caption saying `` disregard their opinion '' and make it a sticky . 
  you may argue it does n't hurt your freedom of speech ( after all , you said what you wanted to say ) , but my action has changed the way people will read your comment , which may lead some to actually disregard it without even reading it and others to read it more critically than they would have . 
   public broadctasters in our country were always very biased in one way or another , depending on which party took hold of them at the moment . 
  and depending on who you ask , they could try to be more neutral , or they could try to be even more biased , but neither has any connection with the issue of freedom of speech as there are dozens of other media outlets to chose from , each with their own biases . 
  public broadcaster 's neutrality is an issue of freedom of speech . 
  when public media are biased towards one side , the responsibility to provide news would lie on private media , whose only objective is to make a profit . 
  without neutral public media you may not have freedom of speech , as public media will support the government , while private media will support whoever will let them make even bigger profit , therefore meaning only one or two options have a right to be openly promoted , while others are dismissed as either against some ideology or do n't help the interests of the company . 
  and one more reason that allows abortion : if the pregnancy is caused by a criminal act ( eg . 
  rape ) . 
  editorial interference into a movie by putting a segment where people have it explained how to watch it and adding a hardly-distinguishable title cards is limiting freedom of speech , as it is meant to change the perception of what the author has said . 
  especially if it 's done by a still public broadcaster , who especially should take neutrality seriously . 
  they took tomasz lis hostage !, 
  not that i would complain ... ( for the readers : tomasz lis is a head editor at as-owned newsweek polska and has a show on onet , and his opinions are sometimes too vitriolic [ even for the liberals ] ( http://kulturaliberalna.pl/2016/02/23/tomasz-sawczuk-recenzja-a-nie-mowilem-tomasz-lis/ ) ( pl ) ), 
  if he could into space , maybe poland can too !, 
  no , he just has a polish surname . 
  in the same spirit we treat that smart penguin from penguins of madagascar . 
  no , he was concerned with more [ down-to-earth matters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_two_who_stole_the_moon ) . 
  no , that was kaczynski . 
  no , not our supreme leader . 
  seems more of a push poll rather than any meaningful step - just like `` national consultation '' . 
  at least there is a fight to amend . 
  over here we already have it in constitution since 1997 , or its conception . 
  but to be fair this document is barely a guideline these days , so it does n't really matter . 
   uhhhhh , that does not sound very good , the workforce thing sounds like slavery and removing amenities seems shitty in general , why would you deny a ( presumably ) nonviolent person ability to get laid with their so or watch tv ? 
  theres literally nothing else to do there ( in the prison that is ) to quote them :  stay in prison should not be pleasant . 
   and in general that all of the jobs should be done for real wages with modern equipment ... 
  but you know , they 're in prison . 
  and according to an anonymous source within the ministry :  stay in prison should not be pleasant . 
  so i would n't count on them giving prisoners any meaningful wages , if any . 
  it seems that our justice ministry is keen on forceful solutions . 
  an inmate convicted of rape rapes a woman on a pass ? 
  toughen the sentences for raping . 
  people use phrase `` polish death camps '' ? 
  make it a crime . 
  none of them addresses the underlying issue , but who cares ? 
  they 're tough on crime !, 
  ministry believes it will be more of second , but given that these prisoners will be forced to work in addition to being incarcerated , it will possibly end up with the first one . 
  http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-wiezniowie-do-pracy-bez-cel-milosci-i-widzen-intymnych,nid,1934466 in short : justice ministry plans to put over 50 % of all jailed into a workforce that could be used by local governments to build roads , sidewalks , help with renovations and taking care of elderly , sick and disabled . 
  there are also plans to remove amenities used by inmates for entertainment , such as so-called `` love cells '' and intimate meetings , as well as tvs and dvds . 
  the proposals should be ready early this year . 
  i do n't have enough expertise to judge who is right , so i 'm talking about `` disagreement on history '' , therefore avoiding making such judgement . 
  what is ridiculous in that ? 
  removing an order because of disagreement on history sends a bad message to researchers ( agree with us or lose honors ) , while also not being a good look when it comes to historical policy and overall image ( we 're not open for any discussions on anything , because we 're always right ) . 
  disagreement is one thing , handling is another . 
  and this government screwed up handling big time - they gave him platform , while proving the narrative of them threatening freedom of speech . 
  i would have said they should have issued a statement saying they believe he 's wrong and pointing out why , but given how badly this government communicates i would n't be so sure it would make matters any better . 
   for instance , it mentions calls from ` intellectuals ' not to remove the order . 
  however , it fails to mention that the removal of the order has been called for for years by actual intellectuals , from virtually all political sides . 
  so intellectuals that disagree with you are not intellectuals ? 
  that 's low , even for polish standards . 
  you already know it , you merkel-loving , zdf-watching , tageszeitung-reading , parade-going gay vegetarian cyclist who ca n't even defend the women you own !, 
  / absolutesarcasm, 
   but germans criticizing polish politicia ... , polish governmen ... poland , all the poles who live , lived before us or will ever live ? 
  that 's just sick !, 
  and they killed the jews 70 years ago so they ca n't tell us what to do now , even if these two facts are in no way interconnected !, 
  it seems everybody hates latvia . 
  poor latvia . 
  except for ones caused by miners . 
  and nationalists . 
  still , we pledged to accept 9,000 refugees , already screened and we have a right to refuse them for any reason . 
  nine thousand , not four million . 
   eg uk yes , sharia is definitely law of the land there , along with birmingham being a no-go zone and david al-cameron beheading nicola sturgeon for not wearing a burka . 
  poland is 92 % catholic . 
  for muslims to have a majority , you 'd have to make the country about 50 % larger , or about 19 million people have to move in and think in the same way . 
  these are moie litery !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ double ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joke : ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ moje ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( mine ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pl ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ mooie ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( pretty ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nl ) . 
  15 euros for 6 mbit/s , although admittedly i 'm not covered by telephone lines ( damn you , orange !, 
  ) , so i have to use a local radio isp . 
  tl ; dr : `` but they were bad too ! '', 
   because it sure as hell does not resemble the hungarian casus . 
  [ it does n't ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/36171/media_rynek_wlasnosc_infografika_700.jpeg ) , however given the fact the govt has pledged to create a law that will limit a market share one company may have it 's not too far-fetched to expect that this law will hit the biggest media , including those that are liberal ( such as tvn , gazeta wyborcza or newsweek ) . 
  as this would probably trigger a sale of their assets , this might mean they will be either weakened or sold to conservatives . 
   their religion gives them a great excuse to keep on acting like animals and it lets them preserve the balance of power within muslim communities ( centered on male muslims ) . 
  you are vastly overestimating the role of religion imo . 
  they are young , they are male - these groups tend to converge and tend to cause trouble , regardless of whether they do it in the name of allah or great poland or a fraternity . 
  they might claim they do it because of religion , but to be frank no one would say `` i raped her because i was drunk , i wanted to have sex and some other drunk guys started groping women , so i said ` why not ? ' '' . 
   dude , what do you propose ? 
  what 's so confrontational about what i said ? 
  semantics . 
  the way you phrased it showed that you divide people in two : those who follow the law and those who are muslim . 
  if you have to deal with problems , you have to at least attempt to show the solutions you propose are for everyone . 
  you want to uphold the rule of law . 
  end .
