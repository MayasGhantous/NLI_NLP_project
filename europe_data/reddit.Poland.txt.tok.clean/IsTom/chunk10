  it 's the new uncontrolled african/middle eastern migration period we 're against . 
  offical negotiations start after they lose voting power . 
  they 're just making sure to be viewed with contempt . 
  we 've had zero muslim terrorist attacks , france had more than that . 
  general opinion is to play it safe . 
  if richer countries ca n't as of yet figure out how to make muslims not blow shit up and burn cars we ca n't as well . 
  all in all it 's about importing uneducated people from culture that has values incompatible with our own . 
  you either respect women or you do n't . 
  i bet she was going to build a dirty bomb to get at all the british xenophobes . 
  actually , we hate coal with passion . 
  we hate it so much that we want to see all of it burn . 
  it goes back to partitions at least , not world war . 
  we 've hard a pretty bloody history ( on both giving and receiving end ) and it breeds a lot of mistrust . 
  because his main point to distinguish people was n't their economic policy . 
  it was either to curb local dissent or get rid of other races . 
  that 's because of how demographics are . 
  if there 's more retired people per a working person more people will be needed to pay for their food , rent and medicine . 
  whatever redistribution magic you do on paper , someone physically has to do work . 
  you ca n't have your car repaired without a person doing the job . 
  yet i have n't seen many people referring to water as `` plastic ice '' . 
  the problem is not trying to grow population , but preventing it from shrinking . 
  when you get one working person supporting two retired people it 's going to be disaster no matter the money , you physically need to do work . 
  only so much can be imported . 
  next thing you 'll tell me it 's szczecin , wroc\u0142aw , gda\u0144sk and \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432 . 
  i 'd think that someone would step back and think hard about what they 're eating when you are calling it `` plastic cheese '' . 
  it changes declension of words around it and this is just general guideline . 
  like elves being in animal category , but wolves sometimes being in human category . 
  there 's a distinction between male humans , male animals and male inanimate objects . 
  yeah . 
  just look at the japs . 
  they 've been doing it for some years now . 
  polish has five grammatical genders . 
  it 's a step closer towards the goal of becoming united with usa again . 
  when will this new age of german terrorism end ? 
   trucks 70 km/h what ? 
  i 've never seen a truck that was n't going 90 . 
  woje ~ voie is warrior ( s ) , w\u00f3dz ~ vod is someone who leads and - two is `` domain of '' . 
  well , it 's better than its translation `` warlordship '' . 
  where do you live ? 
  i 'm a few km from wroc\u0142aw and i 've got 50 mb/s for 50 z\u0142 / month . 
  it 's a stationary aircraft carrier . 
   i guess due to very homogeneous population i do n't think it 's the case . 
  poland has a very homogenous population currently , but our culture is very far from being collectivist . 
  it 's been like that for a long time ( although population was n't very homogenous back then ) . 
   let them be obese if they want that 's a drain on society . 
  increased healthcare costs alone make this a bad idea . 
  not really . 
  just overly territorial people . 
  it 's funny how it 's exactly the opposide of what everyone around has told me for my whole life `` a bad decision is better than no decision '' . 
  y' all need some [ neutrality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usschoqttyq ) . 
   `` it smells of life . '' ~ ~ fountain ~ ~ brie of youth .

  i 'd like one context please . 
  to go . 
  that 's true , but it 's just how demoracy is . 
  it has its faults , but personally i do n't know a better system of governance . 
  educating people is probably the only way to change the fact that popular opinions are often bad for the country . 
  that 's the way life is , but somehow people keep popping up and saying `` thanks x '' , even if it 's just reading the mood of populace . 
  reddit teaches you about writing in style like no teacher in school could . 
  internet points are more important than grades . 
  whether there is a need for it or not is not something that comes in the picture when it comes to causes and effects . 
  i want everyone living peacefully just like the next guy , but europe is stirring and no amount of good will on our part can change that . 
  either we do something now or it escalates . 
  i very much doubt this will die on its own . 
  her stance was what aligned with popular opinion at the time . 
  if popular opinion changes merkel 's stance will change too . 
  and it was crusaders , not christians who killed people in middle ages . 
  nah , it 's just his hippie son . 
  bribes are cheap . 
  to be honest muslims have been whipping up fear against muslims quite efficiently for the past few days . 
  in the end , calling european countries people bad guys , because somebody fucked up informing populace about reasons for it and they ended up not supporting it is not really honest . 
  this was the reason used by blair and only reason used as war justification on the tv back then . 
  any more reasons did not reach me and i suspect i 'm not alone in this . 
  for public opinion it was the decision of putting a stick into an ant hill or not for dubious reasons . 
  balts , it 's time to get your own nukes . 
  russians did n't have balistic rocket nukes back then . 
  mad does n't work for finland alone as they 've got no nukes . 
  do you want everyone and their mother to start amassing nukes again ? 
  what ? 
  iraq invasion was shoddy at best . 
  everyone was going there based on non-existing or fabricated reports of wmds which were not there after all . 
  it 's a harsh option with political consequences ( it would also make at least polish and hungarian goverments angry probably ) , but it is an option nonetheless . 
  it 's the matter of how much will `` nay , we 're not brexxiting yet '' situation escalates . 
   we wolud be  we should  fund our that 's only consequence of the wording of your previous post . 
  if everyone else decides uk is acting in an undemocratic way ( not honoring the referendum ) its eu membership may get suspended . 
  it 's not outright kicking-out , but effectively works the same . 
  mostly polish in poland do n't really give a fuck about them . 
  if they want to be polish so much they can come and work here . 
  this means nothing if they 've just figuratively purged everyone who is n't a private . 
  it 's easy to divide and conquer , and cut off supply of a disorganized army . 
  especially if russia hypothetically managed somehow to overcome their own organizational trouble and mounted a blitzkrieg . 
  the trick is that ethanol freezes at -114 degrees celcius . 
  all you need to do is become high-proof . 
  somebody has n't heard of hobbits .
