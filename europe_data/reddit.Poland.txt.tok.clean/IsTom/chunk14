  not particularly claustrophobic . 
  it 's more of a fear of being stuck in an unventilated area underground if anything happens . 
  we do n't really have tunnels here so i 'm absolutely not used to them . 
  i 've only passed through them a few times in ( i think ) austria and croatia . 
  it looks awesome , sounds awesome and almost certainly will be built to be safe , but still i 'd probably shit my pants before using it . 
  normal tunnels are nerve-wracking enough . 
  vegetables are cheaper than meat . 
  if economy of scale kicks in there will be people trying to sell you non-meat products pretending to be meat . 
  have you tried turning her off and on again ? 
  they 're not `` `` vegetarian '' sausages '' , they 're `` vegetarian `` sausages '' '' . 
  with kitten meat preferably . 
  oil is used for more than fuel . 
  plastics and asphalt are made from it . 
  these days it 's only about 20 % that is n't used for some form of fuel ( motor , heating , aircraft ) , but if it gets cheaper that percentage will grow . 
  and yet people who claim that belgium exists walk freely . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  it was supposed to happen right after referendum . 
  trees are renewable . 
  for now . 
  if we give them carrots they 'll warm up to us . 
  you ca n't expect people to be on your side until they are on your side . 
  it 's a process . 
  i meant as in having a big budget deficit that will be financed by borrowing internationally or printing obligations . 
   our government is taking money from some set of people and after digest it if only . 
  currently they 're just borrowing money . 
   it is the use of one 's money , which the us supreme court ruled was a personal expression . 
  which is retarded . 
  do n't base moral arguments on legal results . 
  law comes from morals and not the other way around . 
  thank you \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0448 , you will be freed from \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c promptly . 
  no problem . 
   fun  moba get out you casul . 
  is all politburo fault . 
  what you say , we are politburo ? 
  it was opposition politburo !, 
  to unite everyone we should realize that `` gyros '' means basically the same `` d\u00f6ner '' in this case and consume * gyros kebab * . 
  they like wa\u0142\u0119sa more than kaczy\u0144ski and they 're in conflict now . 
  i 've seen people from solidarno\u015b\u0107 talking about protests . 
  aaand they 're going to get protests by solidarity against them soon . 
  i do n't get why people spin like it was about press . 
  it was about press , a bit and it was the source of later commotion , but first and foremost the problem was pis hiding away and voting in a scandalous manner without any oversight or sticking to procedures . 
  echo chambers . 
  nowadays you can get all your information from sources that are tailored to all your biases and makes you feel good about yourself . 
  also and can talk only with people that agree with you . 
  you ca n't win . 
  you mention brexit -- you mentioned brexit ; you do n't mention brexit -- somebody else will . 
  thankfully here we know why they do n't give good speeches here . 
  half our politicians have got speech impediments and almost all of them fill the pauses with `` uhhhh '' and shit . 
  maybe we could sell a `` stop polish muslim camps '' campaign . 
  brave last words . 
  we should inform general prosecutor of this !, 
  so ziobro can decide if he wants to jail himself or not . 
  the only ones left will the kind that does n't have a problem with macierewicz being their superior . 
  unemployment is very region-dependent . 
  one one side you 've got pozna\u0144 with 2.2 % and on the other there 's radom with 17,4 % . 
  if you look at powiaty without cities it can go as high as 28,7 % . 
  it 'll make life for the next person easier . 
  prisoner 's dilemma etc. 
  it 's pretty illegal to ask that . 
  suing yourself is probably a bit much , but filing a complaint to pip is n't that hard . 
  they 're not really losing voters as they 're mostly for this `` polan stronk '' rethoric and everyone who is n't them is their enemy . 
  will work for beer . 
  last time i checked mona lisa was 2d . 
  yeah , he even has a mitre . 
  he 's much closer to sain nicolas than our `` saint nicholas '' . 
  and it 's very relevant to us . 
  no matter if you think of them as european or not it 's a big neighbour that has an impact on what happens in core europe . 
   majority of poles does n't like anyone and that 's how it is . 
  however i would suspect that intensity of disdain for pis by e.g. 
  . nowoczesna voters is far greater than for po . 
  that 's plurality , not majority . 
  majority of our population does n't like the currently ruling government either . 
   poland does not want to become more european that 's some newspeak . 
  `` european '' is by virtue of being derived from `` europe '' refering to things that happen west of ural . 
  pesky westerners are usurping words again . 
  take any specific god g. 2 . 
  pick a living person p at random with uniform probablility . 
  ask p if g is real . 
  for any god g answer will be `` no '' with probablity  68 % , as no religious group has global share over 31.5 % . 
  i 'd say technically it 's a proof `` any god is widely known not to be the true god '' . 
  prolly not what everyone is looking for though . 
   4 pp since election that 's `` about the same '' for me , it 's only a little more than 10 % ( not pp ) change . 
  asking for proofs ? 
  are you a putinbot ? 
  hell , i thought they just stole the new issues from waiting rooms . 
  no wonder i could n't find them . 
   so far that lesson is going slowly , but we still have 3 years to elections . 
  it 's not , really . 
  pis has about the same share of votes in the polls as they did when they were elected . 
  it 's absolutely hilarious how pis and their supporters were all proudly talking about `` taking pigs away from the trough '' when they won the election . 
  `` good change '' is their slogan . 
  scientists deal with confidence intervals , not absolutes . 
  it 's not going to be proven invariably safe ( because you can choke on it ) , but there 's a base level of effort put into it before it goes live to find if it 's dangerous or not . 
  as much as i 'm against gmo histeria , gmo is different from `` uncontrolled gmo '' . 
  tight control is the only thing keeping it from being dangerous by accident . 
  at least in poland it 's a toll that 's same for everyone , not just foreigners . 
  do you realize it 's actually a group of people , not a blob of colour on the map ? 
  like these people that live today were n't alive back then ? 
  that and people forgot what it was was like 10 years ago when we had previous pis government . 
  catholic tradiction is to not eat meat at all during christmas eve .
