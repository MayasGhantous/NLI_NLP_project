   but you 're not experiencing the same amount of refugees that the southern balkans are so right now it 's quite manageable on your end . 
  we got around 8.000 refugee requests from eastern ukraine and 726.000 economic migrants from ukraine as a whole ( as measured by short and long-term employment visas granted last year ) [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://kijow.msz.gov.pl/pl/c/mobile/aktualnosci/konferencja_prasowa ) . 
  the difference is that those people follow the procedures required from them to have granted status , not try to tear down the gate with battering ram [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/12177750/migrant-crowd-uses-battering-ram-to-break-open-macedonia-fences.html ) , which is why west does n't hear about it in media . 
   if you are considering the border with ukraine , poland , hungary and slovakia also border ukraine and they have n't had trouble on their side . 
  some politicians from kukiz '15 were calling to build a ~ ~ wall ~ ~ fence on polish-ukrainian border , after an iraqi family was caught trying to cross it , but ministry of interior denounced the idea as `` waste of time and money '' , opting for surveillance with watchtowers and drones instead . 
  you are either very young or had shitty childhood . 
  in poland , playing `` war '' , `` spies '' , or `` police and thieves '' , with kids with least `` courtyard creed '' being forced to play unpopular faction , was popular pastime up until early 90s . 
   nope . 
  you forgot to add breaking the law and acting against these governmental institutions which can not be controlled by the ruling party . 
  well ... technically , they are n't breaking the law by not publishing the court 's verdict , as the law states that the verdict becomes binding upon publishing , but does n't give timeframes for doing so ... ( here we could go into debate on `` spirit of the law '' and `` letter of the law '' , but generally i do n't disagree with you )  actually , pis is a party which is closest to communists in their mentality i know , and this fucking sucks . 
  personally , i did n't vote at all in previous elections , as no viable candidate matched my preferences . 
  i 'm just not happy with various institutions meddling in poland 's internal affairs . 
  we need to sort it out ourselves . 
   their disregard for the constitution does . 
  you do realize that by this definition first three post-communist governments were `` illegitimate '' ? ... 
  our constitution got amended in 1997 , and before that ( barring `` small constitution '' changes in 1992 ) previous one , from prl , was technically still in power - with stuff like `` power belongs to working class '' ( art. 1 ) , `` country 's monopoly on foreign trade '' ( art . 
  7 ) or `` right to work '' ( art . 
  58 ) ... you get the idea ... 
  i wonder why we had no `` constitution defense committee '' back then ... 
   but they are a bunch of amateurs with no idea how to rule now that they actually have power . 
  i think we can agree on this one . 
  i 'm not happy with many laws they recently passed myself ( for example windmill laws and delaying of renewable energy bill again , as it concerns me personally , or 500 + program , as i believe it will only be used by human trash , which should n't have children in first place ) , but that does n't make their government `` illegitimate '' , as you implied in previous comments - all latest polls show their ratings as high as no previous government since ' 89 . 
   i am not familiar enough with the situation in czechoslovakia in 1968 to comment , and i feel it 's irrelevant to the facts at hand - namely , that we have a government with bolshevik tendencies that ignores rule of law . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_spring is pretty decent summary and would be good starting point . 
  long story short , newly-elected government sought to pass reforms that were n't well-received by ussr . 
  after fail of initial negotiations , where soviets tried to put them `` back on track towards communism '' , coalition of warsaw pact countries invaded on 21st august with 500.000 troops , quenching the pro-democratic attempts . 
  do you see parallels yet ? 
   this government is illegitimate , due to them disrespecting the polish constitution , and it does not reflect the views of the polish nation as a whole . 
  oh , right ... democracy is only correct when * our * people get voted in ... 
   many of us support international intervention would you support international intervention in czechoslovakia 1968 ? 
  those people were breaking constitution too ... 
   they might just start proceedings against hungary at the same time , then say that gives them no right to vote on poland may i remind you that it 's exactly the same thing as what eu has beef with poland over with ? ... 
  or are you one of those guys that believe that `` there are no bad tactics . 
  only bad targets '' ? ... 
   the government has started to introduce series of incentives to travel agencies and airline compaines to keep the loss at minimum . 
  tui [ offers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/azqodcd.png ) 7 days all-inclusive at 4-star hotel in alanya for 766pln ( 168 eur ) . 
  how is that even profitable ? 
  turkey was n't hit as hard as egypt and tunisia ( which were top destinations from poland , and few idiots ruined two countries - last time i checked reservations from poland dropped by 70 + % ) , but people are still afraid of terrorist attacks ( especially after series of istanbul bombings recently . 
  [ mfa warning covers entire country ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dk8pntb.jpg ) ) , and go to spain , portugal and greece instead . 
  i think bulgaria reservations increased as well . 
  til `` breast ironing '' is a thing . 
  wtf is wrong with those people ... 
   once it 's gone it 's gone for good . 
  oh , do n't worry . 
  we have have companies that handle that . 
  they buy up leftover infrastructure for pennies on dollar , dismantle it , move to different places where it 's viable , and re-assemble entire production lines there . 
  over past few years , pol-inowex moved entire 300mw coal powerplant from austria to turkey , pulp mill from norway to vietnam ... you get the idea . 
  they have been doing it since 1991 . 
  of course , just like every other discrimination based on something intangible , like religion , one can find thousands of possible loopholes ( during hostage crisis in mecca few decades ago , french special forces , who were asked to help , `` converted '' to islam just before deploying , in order to comply with sharia law ) - it 's just like terrorist attacks occurring in europe - determined assailants will find one way or another ... 
  this . 
  ukraine is very similar to how poland was 25 years ago . 
  i 'm sure there are enough people tired of current status quo and having to bribe their way to accomplish even simplest administrative tasks . 
  having eu support in fighting corruption means the ruling class ca n't simply dismiss accusations and keep stealing the nations wealth - ordinary people can drive out those that refuse on wheelbarrows without having to worry about `` unknown assailants '' beating them up to preserve status quo . 
  saudi arabia visa application has `` faith : '' field . 
  if you 're not from muslim country , they might ask you to provide a letter from local imam . 
  mecca is forbidden city for non-muslims . 
  there are checkpoints on city outskirts - if you get caught , treatment depends on intention . 
  for people without malicious intent , you will only get deported and lifetime ban for entering saudi arabia . 
  if the judge deems that your planned activities were to `` defame islam '' , you 're facing death penalty . 
  people earning 250 $ / mo are never going to visit usa in first place - plane ticket alone costs three monthly salaries for them . 
  what the red tape is blocking are the high earners/middle class , who can afford vacations overseas and have stable and profitable job at home , which guarantees that they wo n't drop it all , in order to do illegal work for pennies in usa . 
  no , all i 'm saying is that `` geographical '' criteria is moot . 
  i agree that there are other , ideological , factors that prevent turkey from joining , as it is now . 
   turkey is not european geographically neither is french guiana , which is located thousands of kilometers away from europe , yet enjoys pretty much all benefits of eu membership , including euro currency . 
  oh , right . 
  i need to go to bed already . 
  was n't thinking clearly . 
  and how is hungarian 25 % any different from dutch 30 % ? 
  end result is the same - large part of population needs to turn up and vote , in order for referendum to be binding ( since it shows the `` will of nation '' ) . 
  you can even convert requirements between both systems with simple math - `` hungarian 25 % '' requires 50 % turnout , while `` dutch 30 % '' means at least 15 % of population has to vote for either side . 
  because without thresholds you end up with [ polish beer-lovers ' party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers%27_party ) having 16 seats in parliament ... 
  same with referendums - all kind of silly stuff that could affect entire country could get passed , if only few hundred people got together and voted `` yes '' , while rest of population simply do n't care/don ' t know about issue being voted . 
  no , they do n't assume that `` male is a liar '' - instead it 's `` husband is father '' - that 's the default state . 
  notice that if you knock woman up while you 're not married , it 's her who has to go to court and pay for paternity tests . 
  because that 's how law works - you make a statement before the court so it 's your job to prove it . 
  if the tests show that you are not a father , you can recover all child support payments you 've made to date , along with interest , and the cost of testing itself ( at least that 's the case in poland . 
  i do n't think uk is very different ) . 
   the father is even made to pay out of pocket for a dna test when he tells child maintenance it 's not his child , the man is always assumed to be the liar . 
  [ tactical voting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tactical_voting ) has been part of democratic process for ages - blame the game , not the player , or so they say ... 
  i recall some dutch user saying in one of previous threads about this referendum , that many in the yes camp are `` strategically abstaining '' and does n't go to urns , so that 30 % turn out wo n't be reached . 
   bcp millenium bank , which is present in poland they do n't use `` bcp '' part over here . 
  it 's only `` millennium bank '' ( https://www.bankmillennium.pl ) - i had no idea they are portuguese . 
  while the article is better than others that presented the issue in western media , and has minor errors ( for example the `` spontaneous '' storming out of church linked video in second paragraph of article was actually a planned feminist group stunt , with both local and foreign media present on mass to `` document '' it ) , it completely misses the bigger picture . 
  there 's this term in polish - `` temat zast\u0119pczy '' ( `` replacement topic '' ? ), 
  - basically a range of topics that can be `` pulled out of hat '' on demand , and used to divert media attention from important topics - they are often `` flashy '' , controversial , some ( like abortion , which ultimately is a moral/conscience issue , with no `` right '' or `` wrong '' single answer ) ca n't simply be `` solved '' - those are often used in poland by all ruling parties to divert public attention from various laws that get passed , which if they had more coverage ( with media focusing on them , instead of filling the air time with this `` fluff '' ) would cause public unrest - i 've seen them used time and time again covering stuff that by all accounts should get people out on the streets with pitchforks and torches - imagine your country passing a bill that nationalizes half of your pension savings ... now , i do n't think that abortion bill has any chance to pass - as noted in article , it 's `` citizens ' initiative '' that needs to get 100k votes first , then it 's put under discussion of parliament , and ultimate voting wo n't be bound by `` party discipline '' ( this is a mechanism that can be used to force representatives to vote one way or another , according to party doctrine , with punishments like fines for those who break it ) in law and justice party ( leader already announced that - this is a matter of each representative conscience and pis wo n't be forcing people to vote one way or another ) , but one might want to know that a bill was passed recently that restrains people 's ability to buy and sell land ... 
  well ... they take non-syrians and 6 billion euro , so ... 
  that one article is n't even that bad . 
  i remember one family went to media saying `` they would rather die from bombs in syria than starve in poland '' after they blew ~ $ 1500 monthly stipend in two weeks ( mind you , 4500 pln they were given is a lot of money in poland , especially since they had living expenses covered by foundation ) . 
  last time i read about them , 2/3 of all families that were flown over `` disappeared '' already . 
  leader of foundation ( miriam shaded , she 's half-syrian herself ) that brought them here became big anti-immigration activist after she experienced first-hand the gratitude of those people . 
  [ see the green flags in background ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_radical_camp_\\ ( 1993 \\ ) ), 
   their distinctive feature is anti-patriotism and devotion to the western culture . 
  today we see many ardent patriots of the united states of america , the european union and its countries in russia . 
  the term `` national traitors '' is not appropriate to this group -- these russians are commited to their distant objects of veneration , they are a real `` fifth column '' , which waits for fundamental forces to launch an attack . 
  it is important to note that representatives of the russian `` fifth column '' are part of a global ideology , which can be described as `` consumer fascism '' . 
  [ some things never change ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyae9pjrp9a ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stilyagi, 
  it 's due to nok losing value versus eur , as a result of falling oil prices . 
  rest of continent is n't tied as much to oil industry and prices of food actually have fallen ( -0.8 % deflation in poland , for example ) . 
   is n't it illegal to discriminate based on race ?
