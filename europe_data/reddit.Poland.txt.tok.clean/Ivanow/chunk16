  ca n't speak much about race , since it 's kind of non-issue over here , but eu gender equality declaration states , roughly paraphrasing , `` all sexes are equal under law , but it does n't exclude favorable treatment of one of them . '', 
  ( i ca n't believe they did n't use `` but some are more equal than others '' ) . 
  edit : [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/gender_balance_decision_making/report_gender-balance_2012_en.pdf ) . 
  exact phrasing is * `` with a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women in working life , the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any member state from maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for women ( as underrepresented sex ) to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers . ' '' * - article 141 ( 4 ) from treaty of amsterdam . 
   '' and we are offering a new solution to manage and refit the soviet-era aircraft carrier admiral gorshkov [ renamed as ins vikramaditya ] , which is 50 percent cheaper than the russian offer . '', 
  russian prices for maintenance and spare parts for military equipment are fucking bullshit , but i 'd be really weary of such deep discounts , when offered by ukraine - only a few days ago , investigation in croatia started , after mig-21 overhaul deal they contracted to ukraine ( since their offer was much cheaper than russia 's ) ended up using second-hand parts ( some serial # are registered to yemen air force ) and falsified documentations . 
  what a load of bullshit . 
  exactly the same talking points were presented in poland 's association agreement talks , and we turned out alright . 
  as long as similar steps ( phare-like programme , strict adherence to copenhagen guidelines , stretching out of entire process - it took 14 years for poland ) will be followed in ukraine , i see no reason they would n't succeed either . 
   have you ever seen one of these in the wild?is it common ? 
  they were almost extinct . 
  they bred them really intensively out of like last six specimens that were stashed away in various zoo 's . 
  nowadays , there are like 1000 of them in total , half of which live in the wild . 
  there were initial problems with respiratory illnesses and parasite weaknesses , due to very shallow gene pool , but it seems to work now , with outlook positive and more and more specimens getting re-introduced in various european countries . 
  no idea . 
  i just recall reading something like that in news post when we signed a deal in ethiopia or nigeria . 
  there 's bound to be some differences , as i just checked prices on our local ebay-equivalent and some of those western ones have sticker prices up to $ 250k - if i were to drop that kind of cash on vehicle , it better has at least leather interiors . 
  that 's just propaganda . 
  everyone knows that romania 's name has nothing to do with rome , but rather come from romani/gypsy people . 
  sorry , we were first  first ursus tractor was built in 1921 , while beer brand was created in 1927 . 
  both are named after latin for `` bear '' . 
  press release is very vague , but from the way they worded it , it looks like they wanted small `` mission accomplished '' party , with un acknowledging their efforts that led to liberation of important world heritage site , and the council went `` we do n't think that 's needed '' . 
  basically , imagine football club being salty after sports newspaper do n't print result of match they have won . 
  those soviet brands have kind of renaissance - they are popular among certain kind of crowd ( apart from those that simply ca n't afford something `` better '' ) - one does n't have to dismantle half of car to change a lightbulb and when car has issue while on the road , most of the time , a hammer and bit of metal wire is enough to get it moving again . 
  poland has been exporting millions of euro worth of agriculture tractors to africa recently ( `` ursus '' brand ) - while they do n't have bells and whistles like for example dutch or french ones , they make it up with price and reliability . 
  they do , for each country 's tld respectively - my friend was running several `` escort '' sites in gulf states and they all got closed . 
  . com / . net / . org in theory are independent , but in practice fall under usa jurisdiction - for example megaupload 's first domain got taken , i know few people who are dropshipping `` replicas '' from china and they have their domains confiscated occasionally too . 
  polish one is working without issues , but they use subdomain of their main . com site . 
  their articles get 2-5 comments on average , with many made by `` generic '' facebook accounts without profile photo ... we can safely assume that not even a dog with lame leg is reading this `` quality journalism '' over here . 
   i 'm not a rabid patriot or a nationalist of any means , i just object to the way the flag has been appropriated by thug groups like the edl to act like it is a standard for racism and white power that some edl members preach . 
  you know why that works ? 
  because those groups were only ones who were flying it . 
  being proud of one 's heritage was displayed by media as something to be ashamed of . 
  we had similar `` problem '' over here , with various fascist groups organizing march on independence day . 
  few years ago , left-leaning media really overdid their narrative however , with nasty smear campaign . 
  as a result , kind of `` let 's take back that day '' movement started . 
  nazis got kicked out , families with kids got invited instead . 
  each year situation improved ( sure , there were/are still some masked hooligans , but nowadays they simply drown in majority of `` normal '' people ) - last year `` damages to city '' bill was like 10k eur , which is pretty impressive , considering close to 150k people participated . 
  stop complaining about `` nasty '' people using your flag to push agenda you do n't agree with , and take it back . 
   it would be utter political suicide for anyone to do it without public approval which is an extremely long way off . 
  [ euro support in poland is constantly falling ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p1wuizz.jpg ) and it does n't look like the trend will reverse anytime soon , as more and more people get entrenched in `` strong no '' camp . 
  at this point , acceptance of euro is n't even a point of contention during political campaigns , with even most euroenthusiastic parties mumbling `` we will accept it when we 're ready '' in tiny voice . 
  welcome to eu infrastructure , cohesion and structural funds . 
  pretty much entire central-eastern europe is one huge construction site nowadays . 
  my voivodeship ( kinda state-like administrative unit . 
  we have 16 of those ) has 10749 completed projects with partial eu funding . 
  that number is 203071 in total for entire country . 
  you do realize that world oldest oil well is in poland ? 
  built in 1852 in siary village , near gorlice town . 
  same with oil refinery built in 1854 in ( mentioned above ) gorlice town . 
  gun laws got changed recently as well , making it quite easy for population to obtain gun permit ( `` shall issue '' instead of `` may issue '' type ) . 
  ** poland will rise again **, 
  economics-wise they were very similar ( with main difference being that the only product available on shelves in shops in poland was vinegar , while in romania it was canned beans . ), 
  main difference was how we went about system change - in romania 's case you shot the previous leader following violent revolution . 
  in poland transition was relatively peaceful , after `` round table '' talks . 
  [ have you taken those into account , or only `` brown '' people count ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society ), 
   what was the worst of this is that dutch f16 's were not allowed to give airsupport , despite being on the scene . 
  the french general in command of the nato airfleet ( including the dutch f16 's ) made a deal to not give airsupport to srebrenica because the serbs had french hostages . 
   after this the dutch changed military doctrine , within every nato operation the dutch sub - officer reserves the right to at any time withdraw dutch troops and material from nato command . 
  [ `` sir !, 
  order from ifor : you are not allowed to depart . 
  you are to stay in camp . 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0im5m5qvj44 ), 
  in poland it 's kind of popularity contest . 
  pretty girls complained that they got drenched so many times and have no more dry clothes to wear next day in similar manner to how i can complain that it 's hard to buy condoms big enough for my massive dong . 
   for a child , to get a hold of a bucket , and free source of water and lots of friends ... thats not boring at all :d all is fun and games until [ local fire department decides to participate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f5l4s3c.jpg ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure americans are allowed to participate in any of their ancestor 's traditions up to 1/64th bloodline . 
  anything more than that would be cultural appropriation . 
  i would love to read those asylum applications - i ca n't think of a single group that was persecuted back then . 
  even employees of secret police and other communists were n't hanged , like it was the case in other former warsaw pact countries - change of leadership was relatively non-violent . 
  economy was in pretty terrible state , i give you that , and many people had to work two shifts to make ends meet , but i 'm sure you 'd agree that simply being poor is n't enough to warrant asylum . 
  actually , there were quite a few - initial fights saw large population movement to romania and hungary . 
  in later stages of ww2 , when russia and germany were no longer best buddies , many refugees went as far away as [ india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digvijaysinhji_ranjitsinhji ) , [ iran/persia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv2mkvl5ray ) or [ uganda ] ( http://kresy-siberia.org/galleries/refugees/polish-refugees-in-africa/ ) . 
  the difference was that those were ** real ** refugees - children , women and elderly - with healthy men stayed behind to engage in guerrilla warfare or organized abroad into fighting corps ( see [ anders ' army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders%27_army ) whom took part in allied war effort and contributed to victory over nazis many times . 
  needless to say , all refugees returned to poland as soon as the fights were over ; somehow i do n't see the same happening with current economic migrants the west is hosting now . 
   i 'll remember to tell the next polish guy i see to get out . 
  please , do . 
  you have no idea how hard it is to find decent construction worker over here nowadays . 
  best ones have `` waiting lists '' that go well into months . 
   that does n't at all explain why ukraine and russia are so red in the map . 
  `` insurrection '' / `` separatism '' , or however you want to call it , in eastern ukraine is n't classified as `` war '' for various reasons by international bodies , so every shooting out there is treated as terrorist attack . 
  in russia 's case it 's mostly by separatist movements , like in chechnya or mafia mob bombing the shit out of each other , while fighting for `` turf '' . 
   poland received in 2015 10,300 asylum applications . 
  it then approved refugee status to 9.9 % of these . 
  so that 's about 1,020 people . 
  most of those refugees were actually from eastern ukraine ( donetsk etc. ) . 
  the ones from mena were only a few hundred ( including 50 families of syrian christians flown over directly by private fundation ) - most of those already left to germany . 
   we had over 300 % yearly inflation rate and no , that 's not a typo . 
  we had 600 % in 1990 . 
  polan # 1 again . 
  polish-hungarian border existed starting from times boles\u0142aw 1st the brave was a ruler in poland ( circa 1000ad ) up until hungary joined habsburg empire in 16th century . 
  in current form of both countries ' statehood , it started again in 1939 , when during munich agreement , czechoslovakia got effectively partitioned among it 's neighbors , with carpathian ruthenia going to hungary . 
  polish-hungarian border was a thing when ww2 already started , with famous p\u00e1l teleki quote , refusing to let germans use hungarian railoads to open up eastern front in poland for nazi invasion , as a matter of `` national prestige '' . 
  after ww2 , those lands went back to czechoslovakia and ukraine respectively , and we no longer have shared border . 
  a minor setback . 
  we used to have shared border for 100s of years . 
  only after ww2 , when poland moved westwards , to make space for ukraine , czechoslovakia squeezed in between us . 
  hanging , when done by professional , is painless - rope snaps spinal cord and victim dies instantly . 
  amateurs on the other hand ...
