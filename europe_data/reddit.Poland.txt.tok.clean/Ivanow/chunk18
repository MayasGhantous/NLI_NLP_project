   i also have the impression that the corruption is much higher that would be the first criteria i 'd use , if i were to draw the line between `` eastern europe '' and `` central europe '' . 
  sure , many countries aspiring to be `` we * central europe * now '' might have a problem with it , but at least they acknowledge it and try to do something about it , while in russia , ukraine and belarus , it 's still seen as `` normal '' thing to do . 
  first time it stuck me that i 'm no longer carrying 50pln bill inside my vehicle registration book to `` smoothen out '' possible traffic control , was a moment i realized i live in normal country . 
  rich people do n't hold money in banks in first place . 
  there are other instruments , like mutual funds , stock portfolios , real estate etc. 
  which all offer greater roi , while by virtue of being rich , they are able to diversify enough to effectively eliminate market risks . 
  only `` pocket money '' for current living expenses is stored in banks . 
   99 % of the time it 's deployed for urgent organ transfer why do n't you use helicopters for those ? 
  from what i remember , that church got a lot of visitors and donations right after that mess started , so it did n't end as bad . 
  it 's not even about court . 
  current law allows persecutors to withdraw cases where `` small amount for personal use '' is involved - those do n't even reach court . 
  sadly , it 's very easy way for police & persecutors to `` pad their stats '' so they rarely make use of it . 
  i feel cheated . 
  with name like that , one has certain expectations ... 
  i could totally see `` invest in southern italy '' campaign . 
  differences between north and south are bigger there than between west and east in poland . 
   we have a nice moat most of usa-mexico border stretches over rio grande . 
  does n't help much . 
   or bulgaria-romania-ukraine and so forth . 
  i do n't think getting to ukraine would get them anywhere . 
  as a destination country , ukraine 's wages are lower than most mena countries nowadays , and getting to germany requires passing poland , where every police patrol on your way will be stopping you for `` traveling while brown '' ( heck , we had some tourists from spain questioned after `` anonymous tip '' that they might be illegal immigrants ) , poland-ukraine border is very closely watched ( there was this discovery series with former-seal dude trying to slip past various police forces worldwide . 
  our border guard caught him in 2 hours ) , and very first steps into poland you 'd make are into podkarpackie voivodeship , one of poorest , most conservative and xenophobic region of poland - i 'm sure some tracksuit-wearing guys would be making `` welcoming committees '' . 
  http://dom.gratka.pl is the most popular one in poland , i believe . 
   they 'll get broke , frustrated and either go back to the east or back home . 
  or more likely - turn to crime , illegal work or extremism . 
  it 's easy , as long as keep your pimp hand strong . 
   i have seen plenty . 
  firms just prefer importing foreigners because they can treat them like rubbish and drive wages down . 
  bbc did documentary on this . 
  they put 12 `` permanently unemployed '' brits to tasks eastern europeans were doing . 
  results , as predicted . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8533172.stm ), 
   i just think it would be interesting to see how many people are coming here , only because they want to live in western europe . 
  judging from data we have so far - pretty much everyone . 
  poland flown 160 people directly from syria , with housing and upkeep paid by private fundation . 
  many local communities organized simple work from men to supplement their income , kids got spots in schools and so on . 
  basically everything you need to settle and live modest , but peaceful life . 
  out of initial 160 people , around 40 remained so far and more keep `` disapearing '' to germany every few other days . 
  you get the idea ... heck , portugal , which for all intents and purposes could be considered `` eastern european '' country , just located in the west , actually wants refugees to come . 
  they do n't have gloomy weather like finland , xenophobic views like hungary , no recent terrorist attacks like france . 
  the only thing they are missing is generous welfare system - out of 4750 prepared spots only 12 people came . 
  poland already has some experience regarding this . 
  when we joined schengen , we no longer could offer visa-less movement to cis countries . 
  as a result , [ pole 's card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karta_polaka ) and [ local border traffic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/local_border_traffic ) was estabilished - both required eu to okay our implementation . 
  this concerns people entering schengen zone , so similar agreements could be worked out for brits wanting to move to mainland europe . 
  shorter tourist trips will be covered by visa-free agreements , but for employment or longer stays , special agreements will have to be reached . 
  regarding movement other way around ( mainland workers moving to uk ) , one can take a look at how various eu members are handled regarding visas to usa - most do n't require visa to enter usa , but some , especially from eastern europe , do . 
  eu do n't seem to have any problem with different treatment like that , so uk post-brexit will probably be able to implement similar measures to pick countries they want immigration from , but it might cost some political capital , as newly-banned countries will definetely complain to brussels . 
  unlikely , unless rules regarding re-distribution significantly change . 
  despite eurosceptics drumming up `` poland will be net contributor anytime now '' for few past years already , eastern voivodeships are so underdeveloped that it will take at least a decade or two for country as a whole to be net payer . 
  2008 ... old news . 
  they use drones to smuggle cigarettes nowadays . 
   otherwise the we will not be able to support even more underdeveloped countries and the whole structure will become unsustainable . 
  hopefully , by that time , ee will be able to contribute as well , `` pay it forward '' style . 
  starting this year , mazowieckie , first out of 16 polish voivodeships , got some funds axed , due to no longer meeting crieria of `` underdeveloped '' region , and second one ( dolno\u015bl\u0105skie ) should join them on next budget - 2020-2024 . 
  well , jadwiga 's official title was `` king '' ( * rex poloniae * ) not `` queen '' ( * regina poloniae * ) , so if we were to marry our leaders now , it would be king & king too . 
  so progressive !, 
  most stuff that applies to rest of countries in europe , works in poland too . 
  as a foreigner , police wo n't be speaking to you , unless they have some business . 
  being nice and cooperative goes long way . 
  what 's important to note is that you should n't try to bribe them to get out of speeding ticket or similar . 
  it might be common in ukraine , belarus or other countries in the east , but over here it will land you in really deep shit . 
  police enjoys great employment security , plenty of benefits , like earlier retirement and nowadays no-one will risk it for 10eur extra cash . 
  smole\u0144sk air crash in 2010 that killed 96 high-rank officials , including president has many conspiracy theories surrounding it and relatively large percentage of `` believers '' ( including our current defense minister ... ) . 
  alleged instruments used by russian fsb to assasinate polish president include : artifical fog , thermobaric bomb , trotile planted onboard , plated birch ... you get the idea . 
  `` pancerna brzoza '' ( plated birch ) - some of `` experts '' , who never saw car totalled by roadside tree , implied that since wood is softer than metal the plane was made of , it 's impossible to have plane wings cut off by collision with it . 
  `` w 2:12 ( various timestamp ) s\u0142ycha\u0107 strza\u0142y '' ( `` you can hear shots at 2:12 '' ) - another `` classic '' from movies with yellow subtitles . 
  one of such movies showing crash site and arrival of emergency services , implied in description that the alleged shots heard in background was fsb agents finishing of wounded survivors . 
   they sometimes refuse to pay taxes , traffic fines and even make their own passports . 
  so , basically a local version of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freemen_on_the_land, 
   if best practice designs become mandatory , the study estimates an eu-wide saving of between 4.8 and 8.3 twh/year by 2020 . 
  and i estimate that it will end exactly like lightbulb or high-power vacuum cleaner bans - we will get whole bunch of new `` home heaters '' , `` industrial light source . 
  not for home use . 
  '' , `` workshop cleaner '' and so on ... 
  i 'd say , the general attitude is that we are n't fond of * some * foreigners . 
  i have yet to hear about someone having problem with our vietnamese or ukrainians . 
  pros : `` western '' quality of life at `` eastern '' prices . 
  cons : `` eastern '' wages , if you 're not working remotely . 
  why is even belarus shooting greece ? 
  you wrote nasty article about batka again ? 
  in poland tourism to arab countries tanked very hard . 
  egypt was the most popular destination , followed by tunis , morocco and turkey . 
  i just checked front pages of all most popular travel agencies and all above pretty much disappeared from there . 
  rainbow tours has greece and spain . 
  tui has minorca and greece itaka pushes bulgaria , greece ( korfu and rodos ) and kenia neckermann has spain pretty much taking up entire front page ( tenerife , costa de sol ) travelplanet has malta , cyprus , canary islands . 
   unfortunately this mentality is not only a characteristic of the farmers here . 
  i swear , everytime there 's some big protest over here , it 's either a farmers or miners . 
  no other group acts so entitled . 
   they just need to start collecting money from all schengen countries and start giving it to those along the external border so they can actually police the schengen border . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are already mechanisms like that . 
  our border police gets some really high-tech toys past few years - last one , in june 2015 , was a set of thermal cameras on top of 50m high towers , stretching across whole kaliningrad border . 
  trying to occupy any sizeable portion of poland would be a meatgrinder for russian forces that would make afghan war look like boy scouts ' camp in comparison . 
  they have absolutely no allies/minority here - literally everyone would be out to get them . 
  we have literally 100s of thousands of qualified chemists and engineers - potential ied makers . 
  terrain is greatly suited for guerrilla warfare , with large % of land being covered with forests , as well as large urban areas where local population can give shelter to fighters ( as shown by `` underground army '' of ww2 ) . 
  and this all is before we even take regular army into equation . 
  no-one with an ounce of historic education denies russian contribution to defeating nazis . 
  / u/culmensis was referring to how russia sees itself as successor of ussr , when it comes to positive accomplishments , but for less-than-noble stuff like deportations or mass-killings , the narrative changes to `` it was n't us . 
  it was ussr '', 
  poland opened warsaw pact archives shortly after joining nato .
