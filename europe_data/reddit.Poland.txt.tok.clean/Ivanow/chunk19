  `` comrades ' '' war plan was basically a blitz towards rhine river , then try to de-escalate the conflict before americans get involved . 
  daily mail is on automoderator 's list and gets your comments de-listed . 
  slow day in newsroom , eh ? . . 
  this stuff happens so often that they often do n't even bother mentioning it , unless there 's some airtime to fill and no one `` famous for being famous '' did something stupid to fill the airtime with . 
   the quality of raw meat should be the same despite of producer or the place of origin - is not it ? 
  i wish this were the case . 
  regulations regarding what is and is n't allowed when raising livestock for consumption vary from country to country - this is actually huge point of contention when negotiating trade deals between usa and eu . 
  ( google `` chlorine chicken ttip '' ) . 
  for example some hormones are banned in poland , as per eu regulations , but pigs grown in russia can be freely fed them and so on . 
  as for raising environment affecting taste - why do you think we have numbers printed on eggs showing whether the hen was locked in cage or wandering freerly ? 
  prices are n't that good ever since ruble tanked , but quality is still top-notch . 
  i recall meat producents in kaliningrad complaining about `` weekend shoppers '' going to poland instead of buying their wares ( this stuff has been going on for years already , before even big politics and embargos entered the picture ) , and the responses in comments section for article was that if they want russian people to buy from them instead , they should put more actual meat into their sausages . 
  of course . 
  but there 's a difference between an unwritten policy of some small store and actual laws - it 's the same in usa - bakeries refuse to make wedding cakes for gay couples or when black person enters a store in white neighborhood , he will be watched like a hawk by employees , but to put this kind of stuff into writing or pass laws legitimizing it would be a career suicide . 
  first person who would want to pass `` roma only '' laws would get crucified by brussels - you ca n't make laws that target/restrict only a single minority in europe in 2016 . 
  title is wrong . 
  it was russian customs officers that caught those smugglers . 
  polish ones do n't care that they are smuggling meat out ( there 's `` unofficial '' limit of 5kg/person enforced on russian side ) - it 's even noted in article : * `` nawet gdy polscy celnicy zauwa\u017c\u0105 , \u017ce rosjanie maj\u0105 w samochodach ukryte mi\u0119so , to towaru nie zabieraj\u0105 . 
  - it 's on our heads , to prevent bringing in objects that are dangerous to our citizens , stuff going on to other side is a matter of our friends from other side of border '' ) . 
  it 's just like every other issue - if you have everyday contact with something , you 're less prone to have warped perception of it . 
  for most western and northern countries , romania is that land far away where vampires live . 
  when in 90s borders loosened a bit , media used pc codeword `` romanian '' do describe crimes committed by gypsies ( which was technically correct , as they were often romanian citizens ) . 
  add to this the similarity of `` roma/romani '' and `` romanian '' and you have recipe for disaster - to this day , first stereotype older people in poland have of romania country is gypsies . 
  luckily , it 's quickly improving , as more poles travel and work abroad , where they meet and interact with actual romanians . 
  gypsies are usually citizens of on of eu member countries . 
  due to `` freedom of movement '' laws , they can go to any other member if they so desire . 
  getting west is not an issue at all either - i can ride a bus to berlin for like 9 eur ( and this is even without criminal gangs organizing transport for `` professional beggars '' who pay back the cost as a share of their `` earnings '' afterwards ... ) as for sending them back ... 
  they ca n't `` force '' them to move ( `` freedom of movement '' , remember ? 
  ) , but they can `` incentivise '' such action . 
  france famously paid 300eur for ever roma adult and 100eur for child who agreed to leave ( [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11020429 ) ), 
  thanks . 
  this is hilarious . 
  sssh ... that will be next amendments proposal . 
  i just googled it ... http://www.thelocal.it/20150923/82-million-amendments-stall-renzis-reform wow ... just wow ... * maj\u0105 rozmach , skurwysyny . 
  * how did it end ? 
  story is from late september last year . 
  amendments got blocked ? 
  did they really print all proposals , as required by law ? . . 
   europeans of all nations , unite !, 
  [ not sure if ignorant of history or deliberate lip service ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/workers_of_the_world,_unite ! ), 
   macedonia will be next to close its borders . 
  ^ this . 
  also , no-one gave a fuck about italy 's and greece 's pleads for help regarding migrants two years ago . 
  only when they started flooding germany , it became `` eu-wide problem '' . 
   currently poland is stalling for time . 
  well , media on both sides probably have their biases . 
  over here , the delays in reaching agreements are blamed on russia [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-brak-porozumienia-ws-przejazdu-polskich-ciezarowek-przez-ros,nid,2136645 ) . 
   this is n't `` russia spitefully banned polish trucks . '', 
  this is `` russia and poland ca n't agree on truck quotas . '', 
  maybe i worded it a bit incorrectly - the statement that both countries ca n't reach agreement regarding transit laws is correct . 
  initially the mess started with russia passing new laws regarding international transit , which toughened many aspects , including raising fees for incomplete documentation ( up to 200k rub ) and impounding trucks for the time of investigations . 
  another issue was how various forms of transit quotas will be counted ( there are 3 categories . 
  poland 's issue was that they do n't take into account how multi-countries corporation transport is handled . 
  if for example polish branch wanted to transport something to supply materials to german factory , under new rules it 's counted towards polish quota , not german one ) . 
  to my knowledge , those issues have been worked out between poland and russia during negotiations , and the only remaining one is actual number of truck quotas . 
   half of russian potatoes are rotten and must be thrown away . 
  that 's evil propaganda !, 
  politburo issued a statement that entire russian potatoes are edible . 
  on more serious note , i would find it hard to believe that actual rotten potatoes get sold for human consumption anywhere . 
  maybe there 's a difference in species , like thicker skin that needs to be peeled off or something ... 
  so ... did merkel approach those countries to take their share ? 
  ( saudis offered to build 200 mosques in germany [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/saudi-arabia-offers-germany-200-mosques-one-for-every-100-refugees-who-arrived-last-weekend-10495082.html ) for their part in helping to `` solve '' the crisis . ), 
  there are no refugees in poland that need re-distribution in first place , so i do n't see any reason why we should be the ones looking for dumping ground for them . 
  it 's germany who 's pushing for `` european solidarity '' when it comes to relocation - deport them to fellow muslim countries instead . 
   oman and the united arab emirates are probably as far away from syria as germany . 
  you got to be joking ... 
  otherwise i 'm really worried about state of education in germany ... damascus , syria -  berlin , germany = 3700km , need to pass 6 countries damascus , syria -  dubai , uae = 2800km , need to pass 2 countries  also , let 's not take saudi arabia or qatar as role models okay ? 
  why not ? 
  those are their neighbors . 
  why does europeans have to carry every burden of the world ? 
   all the bordering countries are full , not willing to take any more refugees , and have problems supporting the refugees already in their country . 
  so ... how many `` refugees '' has saudi arabia , qatar , united arab emirates , oman have taken in ? . . 
  those are rich countries who definitely could afford it , not to mention they are much closer to warzone than germany or sweden . 
   what a mess !, 
  it was them who started it . 
  they passed new laws heavily discriminating polish transport companies and expected polish government to suck it up . 
  when we did n't agree to new quotas , they banned all trucks from poland . 
  we only followed suit . 
  even little lithuania stood up , and while they did n't ban them outright , they passed several new tarrifs that add cost to russian transport companies . 
  ultimately , they need their goods to reach west more than we need ours to reach east , so our negotiation standing is stronger . 
   time to set up cargo truck rental in belarus ... you would n't be first ... after food embargo enacted last year , belarus , a landlocked country , became a major exporter of such goods as shrimps and salmon to russia . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/after-food-ban-russia-markets-shrimp-from-belarus/ ), 
  oh , we do have them . 
  they are simply very tiny , compared to increased cost of living , especially considering much longer lifespans . 
  average pension in poland is 1900 pln - around 430 eur , which is less than half of average wage ( 4066 pln = 925 eur ) . 
  no , but [ ukraine had darth vader running . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/30/yes-darth-vader-ran-for-office-in-ukraine-unfortunately-its-no-joke/ ), 
  this makes russia effectively cut off , as similar ban ( also in tit-for-tat fashion ) has been implemented in poland - polish trucks are banned in russia since 1st february . 
  there are kilometers-long queues of russian trucks waiting for ferry in lithuania [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://tass.ru/en/economy/856672 ) . 
   communism is not about flash but about stability , you were guaranteed to settle down , have a house and a job in order to have kids . 
  that 's about the most accurate description . 
  many older people in poland miss this kind of stability , where state took care of everything , and all you had to be is small cogwheel in a machine . 
  when 90s came , my country turned basically into libertanian paradise overnight - few hundred laws and regulations got replaced with two paragraphs of text ( `` wilczek laws '' ) that basically stated `` anyone can open a company on equal footing . 
  when conducting business everything not explicitly prohibited by law is allowed '' . 
  2 million companies were created in two years . 
  it was n't unusual for ambitious people to run two or three companies at once . 
  huge fortunes were made as a result , but many , especially older , people were/are feeling lost , as everything they worked for and were familiar with , became obsolete . 
  if someone wants to emigrate , they will - eu membership or not . 
  there might be more paperwork involved , but it 's not like in 80s , where berlin wall kept people in at all costs and governments refused to issue passports to all but most trustworthy citizens . 
  well ... with recent death of one of supreme court judges in usa , they will have great opportunity to show us how it should be handled ... for those unaware : antonin scalia has been found dead yesterday .
