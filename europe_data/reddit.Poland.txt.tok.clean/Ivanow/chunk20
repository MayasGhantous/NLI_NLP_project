  he was one of 9 judges , leaning `` conservative '' . 
  important rulings until now were often split 5-4 , with four judges on each side and one that makes or breaks a case . 
  obama already announced that he * `` plans to fulfill his constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time '' * and the new judge will probably be leaning `` liberal '' as a result . 
  okay , but does n't `` multispeed '' imply that end result is going to be the same for every country eventually , even if some , like uk , are n't happy with it ? 
   `` we remain resolved to continue the process of creating an ever closer union among the people of europe . '', 
  is there some data/polls about whether people ** want ** `` ever closer union '' ? 
  it 's been some time since poland 's accession talks , but i do n't recall we were signing up to become state of new `` united states of europe '' ... 
  some are . 
  mostly older ones . 
  people under 30 find it hilarious . 
  but ... 
  it 's wroc\u0142aw that is capital of culture in 2016 . 
  wait for next year :(, 
  [ howto learn polish pronunciation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzhj9ygszw ), 
  yup , it 's photoshop . 
  one of users of wykop.pl ( basically polish reddit equivalent ) made it . 
  at the time of me writing this comment , that image has 2upvotes and 13 downvotes . 
  comment was made in response to submission of article where right-wing tabloid-like publication is outraged how dare the germans insult and belittle poland . 
  ( http://www.wykop.pl/link/3005881/w-niemczech-trwa-karnawal-karnawal-ponizania-i-nienawisci-do-polski/ ) - pretty much every comment at the time of this writing is great bantz with people posting funniest installations ( both current and old ones ) and mocking tabloid for not being able to take joke . 
  it was cool until late 60s , when they tried to entice them to join eastern bloc . 
  after that , when it became clear that israel will align west ( also , it was after arab-israel war , where most arab countries were soviet algined ) , the `` party line '' changed , and we got nazi-style `` jews behind everything '' stuff . 
  in march 1968 we had pretty high tensions between university students and pzpr ( initial cause was censorship of `` anti-russian '' theatrical play , but it later spilled out to anti-censorship , pro-freedom of gathering , anti-racism protests that engulfed pretty much entire country ) . 
  propaganda machine started under `` students to learning , artists to writing , zionists to zion '' motto . 
  protest leaders got declared `` zionist fifth column whose goal is subverting people republic '' , 8000 party members with jewish roots got removed from party , same with policemen and local government members who got sacked . 
  after the purges , on xii pzpr party plenum , zionist infestation has been declared cleansed ( between 15 and 20 thousands jews left the country - they had to abscind their polish citizenship to get permission to leave - they got special `` one way out '' document instead of passport ) and jewish-polish relations became almost non-existent until 1989 , when new democratic government sought to restore relationships . 
   it is possible that you might be mistaken . 
  of course , i might . 
  like i said - i 'm not an expert . 
  i just recall similar argument being posted in response to `` blacks commit more crimes '' stormfront copypasta . 
  look , i 'm not a sociologist , so i ca n't speak about content of research listed in first few paragraphs regarding effects of stereotyping ( kids internalizing stereotypes and having low self-esteem and so on ... ) , but stuff listed in paragraphs 3-5 is pure bullshit ... now , in order :  team displayed a banner using a disparaging reference to the trail of tears for which the principal of the school apologized to native americans , stated that the cheerleader squad responsible would be disciplined , and that all students would be given a lesson on the actual history of the trail of tears . 
  you see , one should n't treat soccer hooligans excesses too seriously . 
  when lithuanians were whistling when polish anthem was played on \u017dalgiris-lech match , they did n't went to uefa crying that his feefees were hurt . 
  instead , for next match fans displayed * `` lithuanian peasant , bow before polish overlord '' * banner . 
  press was outraged , mfas were apologizing each other , but actual fans did n't care - cheering for own team and insulting enemy 's is part of game , and if you managed to piss them off , it means you 're doing it right . 
   majority of non-indigenous people believe that aboriginal women are dirty , promiscuous , overtly sexualized , which makes these women vulnerable to violent assaults now , from what i know , the only thing that 's responsible for rape is rapist , and the way woman dresses or how it 's portrayed in media should n't have anything to do with it , nor is in any way taken into account when sentencing offenders . 
   over represented among the missing and murdered women i 'm pretty sure that it 's more of a case about living in below-average income areas ( which may or may not be connected with paragraphs 1 and 2 ) and issues it brings . 
  correlation does n't equal causation . 
  * first they came for your jobs , now for your women . 
   for example , this kind of depiction of a native american perpetuates the stereotype that they were some uncivilized savages , running around all the time with feathers in their heads and doing strange rituals . 
  are n't you reading too much into this ? ... 
  i 'm obviously not an expert on native american culture , but to my understanding , they did wear feathers for ceremonial purposes ( just like slavs wore wolf or bear skins ... ) and they had strange rituals ( at least from europeans ' point of view . 
  also , i 'm sure a lot of stuff europeans did was strange to natives when they met as well ) . 
  now , i remember shitstorm that was over here when pc police got their hands on `` bambo , the black child '' poem that 's read to kids in kindergarten here . 
  we got usual crying of `` racism !, 
  '' , talking heads in studios analyzed it , some linguistic professors defended it , and so on ... 
  entire mess got pretty nicely summed up with this comment , someone made under one of articles about issue :  for me , this work was and is a cheerful story about a naughty boy from a distant , exotic country , that , although so distant -- both the country and the boy -- is also similar to me . 
  he has a joy of life which is expressed , amongst other ways , in the climbing of the trees ( i climbed them too ) , and has a slight note of defiance , independence , liberty . 
  which was and is close to me ! '', 
  personally , i wish adults stopped projecting their issues/insecurities on kids ' stuff .

  press release by lukoil : http://www.lukoil.com/press.asp?div_id=1&amp;id=4324&amp;year=2016 press release by amic : http://www.amicenergy.com/press_release.html lithuanian and latvian stations will retain `` lukoil '' branding for at least 5 years . 
  in poland they will be rebranded to `` amic energy '' immediately . 
  in poland ( and probably latvia and lithuania as well , given vagit alekperov 's statement ) lukoil stations have been widely boycotted in aftermath of crimea and eastern ukraine fighting . 
   how difficult is it to understand that it is much easier for criminals to transport 1 million euro in 500 notes than in 100 notes ? 
  1 milion euro weighs around 2,2 kilos in 500eur notes and around 5,3 kilos if using 200eur ones . 
  yes , it 's more , but still relatively easy to transport - you can stash that amount in shoebox . 
  they would have to cut all notes above 50eur before it becomes even relatively inconvinient to carry those kind of money around . 
  biggest usd bill in circulation is 100 $ - almost 7 times lower face value than the eur banknote they want to get rid of . 
  despite that , everytime they raid some drug cartel in mexico , they find [ literally whole rooms of them ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/yegon_millions.jpg ) . 
  as for laundering itself , you could pack an entire truck with euro bills and drive it across europe and it would still be a drop in global scale of things - three years ago hsbc paid $ 1.9 billion fine in usa for assisting to launder $ 670 billion ( sic ! ), 
  of mexican cartels money . 
  personally , i liked soviet solution to lebanese terrorists taking hostages more ... 
  in 1986 ( then just-founded ) hezbollah kidnapped four ussr diplomats in beirut . 
   unlike the approach the united states used to resolve the twa crisis , however , the soviets did not bother negotiating with hezbollah through nabih berri , lebanon 's justice minister and leader of the shiite amal militia . 
   instead , the kgb kidnapped a man they knew to be a close relative of a prominent hezbollah leader . 
  they then castrated him and sent the severed organs to the hezbollah official , before dispatching the unfortunate kinsman with a bullet in the brain . 
   in addition to presenting him with this grisly proof of their seriousness , the kgb operatives also advised the hezbollah leader that they knew the identities of other close relatives of his , and that he could expect more such packages if the three soviet diplomats were not freed immediately . 
  no other russian diplomats have been kidnapped in lebanon since then . 
  unless games workshop started doing 1:1 or 1:3 scale figures , unlikely . 
  that painting is 4x10 metres large , would make a hell of a box . 
  well ... last time germans tried to teach lithuanians about him , it [ did n't end well ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/matejko_battle_of_grunwald.jpg ) ... 
   i bet they will try to force other eu countries to do the same . 
  you do realize that we already have similar laws in poland for over 10 years already ? ... 
  art . 
  22 1 . of commerce code ( dz . 
  1807 ) and art. 25 1 . of foreign exchange law ( dz . 
  1178 ) puts a ceiling for cash transactions at 15k eur equivalent of pln , as per nbp exchange rate . 
   so in other words , do n't be a white collar criminal and you 're fine . 
  not sure if trolling or st. petersburg employee ... yukos case has been widely publicized both by council of europe [ [ 1 ] ( http://humanrightshouse.org/articles/6331.html ) ] and transparency international [ [ 2 ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/100805382 ) ] reports as a political case and russia lost numerous lawsuits in front of echr and arbitration courts . 
   if it 's a near certainty you must have a lot of examples to show us , why do n't you share a few ? 
  i do n't think there 's much difference in whether it 's `` eu army '' or `` german army '' who comes to `` liberate '' us , just like it did n't matter whether it was ussr or warsaw pact army who came to aid with `` immediate assistance '' upon ( alleged ) request from czechoslovakian party ... as soon as we give control of our army , we cede a say in what ultimately happens within our borders to rather unspecified official whose country interests might not align with ours . 
  for a small taste of how `` common military '' might look like , just take a look at clusterfuck the schengen zone turned into in face of recent immigrant waves - there are talks about kicking greece out , hungary gets shit on and called literal nazis for daring to defend their borders themselves , germany literally ignores previously made agreements ( dublin2 treaty ) and invites everyone to disregard them , uk goes `` lol , not my problem '' and so on ... 
   i 'd rather see a unified european army over my dead body . 
  with current state of affairs , when germany does n't like the fact that we do n't want to take any refugees or are worried about `` state of democracy in poland after elections '' , we can tell them to go fuck themselves . 
  i do n't want to see `` brotherly help '' like chechoslovakia '68, 
  not this shit again ... 
   there is no way the average beggar in sweden makes more than one or a couple of euros a day . 
  you would be surprised ... poland is much poorer than sweden , and [ daily haul in warsaw is 200-500 pln ( 45-110 eur ) . 
  according to police and social services data only 10 % of people begging on streets over here are ones who really need it ] ( http://natemat.pl/85645,zawod-zebrak ) . 
  heck , we had one [ youtuber wrap up manequin in beggars ' clothes and he got 62,4 pln in 3 hours ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iptmna0fhtk ) ... 
   birds of prey are pretty quick ( much quicker than drones i 'd say ) eagle ( * haliaeetus leucocephalus * ) - 160km/h hawk ( * buteo jamaicensis * ) - 190km/h drone ( * gopro \u00ae solo * ) - 89km/h, 
  police dogs who lose teeth during service get [ titanium implants ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ealqi0f.jpg ) - i 'm sure we can figure something out for birds as well . 
  also , current drone models are much safer than they appear - most designs include some kind of protective cover over rotating blades , and even if those were n't present , electric engines have relatively low power - enough to cut skin , but not enough to chop off limb ( i think some singer broke a finger on a tour in mexico last summer , when trying to catch a drone flying over stage - human fingers are much more fragile than claws of eagle who spent past few thousand years evolving to attack targets while diving at 160km/h ... ), 
  here 's poland 's ministry of foreign affairs 2013 press release about that movie : http://www.msz.gov.pl/pl/aktualnosci/wiadomosci/indyjska_premiera_filmu_o_dobrym_maharadzy__ktory_ratowal_polskie_dzieci over here that group is often called `` dzieci maharad\u017cy '' ( `` children of maharaja '' ) . 
  one of most prestigious schools in warsaw have jam saheb digvijay sinhji as a patron . 
  as a kind of `` pay it back '' , it funds stipends for gifted refugee children who settle ( d ) in poland . 
  did n't we get some valley from you like two years ago ? 
  or was it different area ? ...
