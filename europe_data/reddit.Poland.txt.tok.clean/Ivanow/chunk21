  we gave you 1205ha in 1958 and you were supposed to give us same ammount in different area - in order to straighten up the borders a bit . 
  we only got 838ha . 
  we still have n't got the rest . 
  perfidious pepiks : s, 
  personally , i do n't even care that much about current migrant situation - those people will never want to settle in poland and will ride to germany on first available bus ( as evidenced with only 35 who are still present here out of 180 people from syria whom poland flown directly and granted asylum ) . 
  i find especially early treatment of issue abhorrent , with eu ignoring italy 's and greece 's pleads for help until it became inconvenient for germany [ ft article from 2013 ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/37e92a3a-2cf0-11e3-a0ac-00144feab7de.html ) . 
  if someone asked me such question 3 years ago , i 'd wholeheartedly support it , but after seeing how union handled/handles recent issues ( treatment of greece , inaction regarding situation in ukraine , `` refugee '' crisis , uk referendum talks , debate about `` endangered democracy '' in poland ... just to name the few . 
  ) , i want absolutely nothing to do with union in such shape , and if there ever was a referendum in poland , i 'll vote for leaving union in such form , in favor of maintaining only schengen and free trade agreements . 
  instead , i would like my country to focus on developing relationships with our other neighbors ( baltics , ukraine , czech republic & slovakia , hungary and romania ) as well as china and india . 
   but doubt that would happen with netflix or other internet services . 
  it 's definitely doable , and allows even greater precision , since netflix has your address on file - no need to warn half of state when there 's gas leak in some building , but if it happens two blocks away from me , i 'd like to know . 
  even services that do n't require registration have some limited capabilities to do something similar , thanks to geo-targeting ( for now , it 's most widely used for `` meet hot singles near cityname '' ads ... ) . 
  from purely legal standpoint , it carried no weight , i.e. 
  you would n't get additional sentence for `` breaking '' it ( still ... refusing to sign one could get you fired from job or expelled from university ) - only actual crimes counted . 
  however , it was great psychological tool - both in cases where `` ordinary '' people made a `` slip up '' - for example were seen in `` undesirable '' ( underground opposition members ) company often or similar little things - basically it served as `` remember , big brother is watching '' kind of reminder to steer people away to save them future problems . 
  even more important was to get actual opposition activists to sign one - it was great first step , kinda like in that [ `` boiling frog '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boiling_frog ) story - first time you meet them , they only want you to sign this relatively innocent piece of paper , next time , they might chat with you a bit for few hours , asking how are you doing , noting down your story , then ask you to sign it ( `` why you would n't want to sign it ? 
  you already signed that one , first time we talked . 
  it 's nothing dangerous out here . 
  it 's just transcript of our little chat that i need to show to my superiors , to prove that i 'm working . 
  do n't make my life difficult , man . '', 
  next time , they might slip a few questions about someone they were really interested in ... 
  it 's just like interrogation - the hardest step is to get mark to start talking . 
  it 's almost non-existent in poland . 
  we had 110 cases in 2014 , mostly within gypsy population and people who picked it up while traveling abroad . 
  vaccinations for it are mandatory since 1975 . 
  * i , signed below , declare and commit to renounce all acts harmful to polish people republic , and especially to respect the existing legal order . 
   `` you twitter a lot , do n't you ? '', 
  the police said , when they were sitting in his office . 
  `` we have received orders to ask you to watch your tone . 
  your tweets could be perceived as inciting . 
  what the fuck ?!, 
  we used to have `` talks '' similar to those , when [ `` unhappy people '' from sb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s\u0142u\u017cba_bezpiecze\u0144stwa ) came over to discuss your recent behavior/remarks . 
  i wonder where will they will start asking to sign [ `` declarations '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cmolzcn.jpg ) ... 
  it 's just like rice in asia - benefits from economy of scale . 
  it 's a staple of diet over here - most dinner dishes use them in one form or another , grows very well in our climate and specialized machines make digging them out of ground a non-issue . 
  skyscrapers do n't count . 
  he 's from denmark , not norway . 
  you know , white instead of blue cross ... 
   plenty of places are just fine even with broad legal firearms access , because their cultures are fine . 
  pretty much this . 
  20 years or so ago , one could easily get their hands on ak-47 by asking `` right '' people at local `` stadion market '' ( `` 10th anniversary stadium '' one in warsaw was the biggest , but pretty much every major city had one where `` semi-legal '' ( pirate cds , `` adidos '' shoes ) or outright illegal ( weapons , drugs ) goods could be bought ) , but despite that , we never had any mass shootings . 
  even criminals ( pretty much every time police raids some gang , they find guns , semi-auto rifles or grenades ) have respect for weapons over here and do n't use them , unless absolutely necessary ( sending tracksuit wearing thugs with baseball bats to extort racket is just as effective - no need to get guns involved ) - we simply do n't have junkies who pull the gun on people on streets to get their fix . 
   one of those two things i wonder which one ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   if so , can i defend myself legally with this in poland ? 
  haha . 
  no need to pull out arquebus - plenty of `` wild west '' / american western [ guns ] ( https://www.militaria.pl/pedersoli/rewolwer_colt_1861_navy_36_7,5_standard_black_\\ ( bcru_1861navy36 \\ ) _ kr_p16109 . xml?cat = 318 ) qualify . 
  on more serious note , it 's relatively easy to obtain sport and shooting license - laws got changed from `` may issue '' to `` shall issue '' type recently , so all you have to do is to sign up to one of numerous shooting clubs ( getting into hunting club is more time consuming ) and after passing psych evaluation and gun handling test , you 're free to buy a gun/rifle . 
  self-defense laws in poland require you to use `` appropriate '' measures , meaning you ca n't shoot someone even during home invasion case , but if they put your life in danger , by for example pulling a knife , they are a fair game . 
  still , self defense is regulated by article 25 of penal code here and notes few exceptions where even using overwhelming force and killing attacker wo n't get you punished . 
  \u00a7 3 for example explicitly mentions `` fear or outrage '' . 
  as long as you lawyer up and do n't have previous convictions , you will be fine . 
   one soccer match between some of the more famous clubs probably would account for more crime than an entire year of luxembourg . 
  those statistics are measured per capita - while soccer hooligans are duking it out 100vs100 on sunday afternoon , 30 million other people are eating a dinner . 
  also , relatively large % of population lives in villages , where `` everyone knows everyone '' - people do n't chain up their bikes in front of shops . 
  ninja-advertising . 
  like that one dude who got fined for pulling up t-shirt and exposing boxers with booking site logo at euro cup . 
  pretty much every major sports association has rules banning political stuff like that . 
  i recall a case of fifa [ banning red poppy symbol on shirts ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/8872051/fifa-confirn-ban-on-england-players-shirts-for-the-friendly-match-against-spain.html ) in similar fashion . 
   `` fifa 's regulations regarding players ' equipment are that they should not carry any political , religious or commercial messages , '' the statement said . 
   the us apparently is only 94 % english speakers aswell . 
  many shops in southern states have signs and customer support in spanish in addition to english . 
  current government is very ... polarizing . 
  both pro- and against - protests occur . 
  as for refugees - it is true that only a small percentage of ukrainians we 're getting are `` genuine '' refugees - folks from donetsk areas , with kids covering in fear when they hear ambulance sirens , expecting artillery shelling and wetting their beds overnight , but we got some of them too . 
  as for syrian `` refugees '' , we got 160ish of them last year - they were flown directly from damascus with chartered jet and supported ( housing , food , pocket money , schooling for kids , work for adults in some instances ) by private foundation here - over half of them `` escaped '' to germany already , some left overnight , without even leaving `` thank you '' note . 
   which russia would see as an act of aggression oh , really ? 
  russia routinely has training drills that involve nuking our capital ( `` zapad '' manouvers ) , but having ** defensive ** forces ** stationing within ** our borders is somehow * aggression * now ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines  betteridge 's law of headlines is an adage that states : `` any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word * no * . '', 
  current leaders got elected in fair , democratic elections and have the mandate to rule . 
  west needs to respect poles wishes , even if new government policies do n't align with their interests . 
  oh , if it 's about `` migrants '' , not `` refugees '' then i see no problem . 
  poland accepted way more than any `` quota '' eu might think of already . 
  depending on source , between 400k and 900k ukrainians immigrated to poland in past two years . 
  we already got experience in this - 20 years ago we got 70ish thousands of refugees from chechenya . 
  by sheer localization - we 're right next to germany and sweden is short ferry trip away , human trash gets weeded out and we got left with 8 thousands people who really care about safety and not social benefits . 
  nowadays almost all of them are upstanding members of society - they started companies , pay taxes , speak our language , represent our country as sportsmen and identify as `` poles '' . 
  people over here do n't give a shit about being branded `` racist '' - if you start trouble , you get kicked out - `` my house , my rules '' style . 
  everyone else is welcome . 
  i have no idea where it came from , but in polish language there 's a kind of `` triumvirate '' of jews , masons and cyclists that are supposedly behind everything . 
  that phrase is often used to mock conspiracy theorists . 
  however , the guy from that article seems to be actually deadly serious - full phrase he used was * `` as if world should develop in only one direction , according to marxist idea . 
  new melting pot of cultures and races , world made of cyclists and vegetarians , who only use renewable energy sources and fight every instance of religion '' * - basically , he tries to paint a vivid picture of `` liberal , fedora-wearing hipster '' , and wants nothing to do with it . 
  we accepted 84k refugees from chechenia , around 9k settled permanently ( rest moved to `` greener pastures '' in western europe ) . 
  they were n't liked initially - most of anti-immigration sentiments we hear nowadays were also said back then ( minus isis and terrorism ) , but both sides wanted the relationship to work out - immigrants made `` cook outs '' with caucasus cuisine , presented their history , songs and culture , poland required mandatory training in our cultural norms and language lessons , provided bare minimum in terms of social support , in order to force people to find jobs and so on ... nowadays , most of people who arrived 20 years ago see themselves as `` poles '' first , while adding `` of chechen origin '' . 
  majority are running own businesses . 
  most famous one is mamied saidowicz chalidow - mma champion from hometown . 
  i knew it !, 
  does n't seem so . 
  they acknowledge turkey 's efforts in article - * `` we are also seeing efforts by turkey to reduce the number of illegal migration departure from turkey , '' he said . 
  `` but we can not confirm a sustainable , permanent , and visible reduction because of these activities and based on individual steps in december . 
  '' * storms simply give immediate results , since people simply do n't put boats to sea as there are 2-3 meters high waves now , while it 's too early to asses effectiveness of turkey 's actions . 
  best korea has elections with one coalition participating , 99,97 % turnout and 100 % votes cast for ruling party . 
  would n't call them `` democracy '' tho ... 
  why the pessimism ? 
  apart from greece ( i do n't know enough about situation in bulgaria to make a statement ) , there are many other former warsaw pact countries like poland , czech republic or baltics , who benefited greatly . 
  modern satelite providers have even `` broadband '' in their offer ( up to 10mbit/s ) , but the ping absolutely sucks ( for obvious reasons ) and data caps are very restrictive ( some providers have unlimited transfer in `` off-peak '' / nighttime hours ) . 
  basically it 's the same movements that happen after every elections , just this time `` wrong '' ( in western media opinion ) people are getting the boot , and they started propaganda machine . 
  remember `` constitutional court crisis '' they covered few days ago ? 
  they did n't mention that original end of term for judges was supposed to end in december , but po ( previous ruling party ) knew that they are going to lose elections , so they shortened their term and elected five new judges prematurely . 
  since those were the `` good '' people , no `` defend the constitution '' protests were organized and no-one was complaining to brussels back then .
