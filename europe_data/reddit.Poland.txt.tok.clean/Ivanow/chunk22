  pis won elections fair and square and has popular mandate to rule . 
  west needs to respect poles ' choice that new government policies might not align with theirs . 
  if they prove to be incompetent they will lose next elections ( or earlier - if people will be unhappy with direction poland is heading , they will carry them out on wheelbarrows themselves , without outsiders ' `` help '' ) . 
   just wish their infrastructure projects were n't so wasteful i was under impression that infrastructure projects were doing fine . 
  plenty of high quality roads got built . 
  `` social capital '' and `` innovation '' are fields where biggest frauds are going on , with stuff like `` 125k eur wordpress-based `` cat lovers '' portal '' or `` mozilla firefox competency certificate '' training going on . 
  well , on western front , we have more tanks than germany this time , on east , we got ourselves a cozy buffer of smaller countries - it 's kind of impossible to launch any backstabbing attack from kaliningrad oblast alone . 
  we should be safe for now . 
  poland here . 
  also , my mom is a nurse , so i have kind of `` above average '' knowledge of how the system works . 
   how much do prescriptions cost ? 
  most common prescribed medicines are on `` partial refund ( co-payment ? ), 
  list . 
  this is published every month by ministry of health 's [ website ] ( http://www.mz.gov.pl/leki/refundacja/lista-lekow-refundowanych-obwieszczenia-ministra-zdrowia ) - to get rough idea about prices , [ here ] ( http://www.bip.mz.gov.pl/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/37944/zalacznik-do-obwieszczenia.pdf ) is latest one from 23th december 2015 ( huge pdf warning ) - first column on list is `` active substance '' , second one is brand name , last column is the amount you actually pay at pharmacy with prescription ( it 's in pln - divide it by 4 if you want to see rough usd price ) . 
  private doctors who are n't part of national health services can write prescriptions too , but those are n't refunded ( 100 % co-payment ) - patient pays price from column 10 in such case . 
  now a bit about pharmacies - prices for all drugs on that list are fixed and pharmacies ca n't change them . 
  they also need to inform the patient about possible `` generic '' variants of said drug . 
  pharmacies ca n't advertise themselves as `` cheapest '' or similar , as this would be kind of misleading . 
  most are pushing otc drugs , skincare and similar nowadays as a result , since those are mostly unregulated and have much higher profit margins for them . 
  advertising of prescription drugs is banned on tv and other mass media as well ( i swear , `` diet supplements '' ads are a real plague nowadays ... ) . 
   do doctors treat you well ? 
  well , most of them are friends of my mother or mine . 
  general population might have different experiences . 
   is universal healthcare worth the higher taxes you pay ? 
  it 's not paid in taxes , but rather as separate compulsory monthly fee that everyone who 's employed pays ( unemployed , students and children have it paid by state ) . 
  monthly fee in 2015 was 279,41 pln ( $ 69 ) . 
  definetely worth it in my opinion , especially after i read some horror stories on reddit about people going bankrupt from medical bills or having to pay 500 $ for ambulance ride that took them to out of network hospital . 
   if you have had experience with universal healthcare and the current united states healthcare system , how would you compare them ? 
  tbh , warsaw , poland 's capital is pretty `` meh . '', 
  visitor-wise . 
  personally , i 'd point krak\u00f3w ( cracow ) and tr\u00f3jmiasto ( three-cities metropolis - gda\u0144sk + gdynia + sopot ) as my top recommendations . 
  yay , easter snow bunnies again . 
  perks of living in oceanic climate . 
  -10 c outside right now here . 
  apparently it will drop to -25 c in south-eastern voivodeships this night . 
  police and social workers pleaded on tv to watch out for lonely and homeless people . 
  depending how far away from border you 're living , it might be worth to make a short trip and buy pre-paid card just for international calls ( you can top it up over the internet afterwards ) . 
  when play first started offering unlimited eu-wide calls for 49pln ( ~ 11,5 eur ) , many entrepreneurs bought sim cards in bulk and started re-selling on german ebay . 
  play closed the offer down , due to abuse soon afterwards , but new offer is still a decent deal ( i think it 's like 1000 minutes and 0,19 pln ( 0.04 eur ) afterwards . 
  competition between mobile providers in poland is really cutthroat . 
  depends on country , i guess . 
  all four major mobile providers in poland ( [ orange ] ( http://www.orange.pl/kid,4000377334,id,4002768574,article.html ) , [ t-mobile ] ( http://www.t-mobile.pl/pl/dlaciebie/obsluga-klienta/uslugi/roaming ) , [ plus ] ( http://www.plus.pl/uslugi/roaming-w-abonamencie#tabs-3 ) , [ play ] ( http://www.play.pl/uslugi/nielimitowany-roaming-ue/ ) ) include `` europe-wide '' minutes in their standard plans ( usually 20eur/mo or higher ) or as tiny fee ( ~ 1,2 eur ) for pre-paids and lowest plans . 
  ( to give credit where it 's due , they were given t-shirts during euro 2012 . 
  she was also given a scarf on miss world 2006 promo poster ( i recall people petitioning to give her * fischbein * bras instead ... ) . 
  god forbid adults from west see a bronze nipple . ), 
  that 's very common characteristic for autoritharian regimes ( or aspiring ones ) - they always have a boogeyman ( nobility , bourgeoisie , jews , communists , kulaks , america ) that all failures can be blamed on , while every success comes from `` dear leader '' or his guidance . 
  translation : `` so ... zagrzeb is buried under snow '' . 
  does n't work in english ... 
  first link says `` due to circumstances unknown to us '' , second one explicitly mentions `` recommendation of ministry of education '' ( of russia ) . 
  that 's the funniest thing of all this mess ... every government until now was replacing people in media and state-controlled companies after winning elections ( [ see this handy list for tvp ( public television ) and how it overlaps with elections ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/telewizja_polska#w.c5.82adze_tvp ) . 
  suddenly it has became a problem ? 
   why is it relevant he has written in other polish newspapers ? 
  does that somehow make his opinion less valid ? 
  people are getting pretty pissed off with former government-leaning press writing articles like that , then citing themselves in `` germany/europe/uk / other country outraged about latest pis decision ... '' articles , pretending they were written by unaffiliated third party . 
  everyone is equally poor !, 
   yep , bees are important . 
  poland has those bees laws too . 
  apparently professors use them to fail law students who annoyed them . 
  i saw some facebook fanpages for those articles in penal code . 
  took me some time wondering why norway is second worldwide , behind serbia in search popularity for `` tesla '' , [ then it hit me ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_tesla ) ... 
   when a country is desperate for a product , and that market is n't just as desperate - they 'll almost certainly push prices higher , they 'd be stupid not to . 
  belarus is already a huge apple and salmon ( sic ! ), 
  exporter to russia . 
  i predict that figs will follow soon ... 
  i just checked laf wikipedia page and it looks that they have two l-39c albatros fighter jets , which gives some of polish aviation museums air superiority over lithuania , without even bringing russia 's forces into picture . 
  it 's not 1939 , where you hunker down on some hill and shoot off any foreign head that appears on horizon ... 
  well , [ memento mori ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memento_mori ) was a big thing in medieval europe . 
  nope , central poland . 
  france gets shielded from eastern winds by baltic sea , carpaten , alps , and german highlands , while we 're sitting in middle of eurasian tectonic plate - land is as flat as pan , up until ural mountains . 
  as a result , air corridor gets created that brings us cold air from over siberia . 
  two years ago we had -30 degrees even in seaside towns ( [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://en.tutiempo.net/climate/02-2012/ws-121360.html ) ), 
  oh , sweet summer child ... 
  opening windows in such temperatures causes clouds to form instantly in your room ( [ video for demonstration ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucztnoq4mcs ) ) but the air itself is n't that unpleasant , since moisture is usually very low - as long as you have warm clothes you will be fine ( just watch out for mouth - lipstick or something similar is very useful ) . 
  it 's the same as in case of +30 - if moisture is low , it 's nice and actually comfortable , but if water % in air is high , you feel like inside of sauna . 
  it can get way lower than -30 . 
  poland 's record is -41 c ( siedlce , 1940 ) and we 're way south from arctic circle . 
  it 's just like prohibition era in usa . 
  if people feel the laws are unjust or downright stupid , they start ignoring them altogether . 
  i do n't think i 've seen any other country where cb radios are so common among non-truck drivers as in poland . 
  people give each other heads-up about patrols and cameras all the time . 
  while i do n't condone dangerous driving , after another region where four-lane , newly-built highway going straight towards horizon and you see speed limit of 70 km in place like that , one simply stops caring . 
  over here it looks awful especially when spring melts all remaining snow , and and all shit that accumulated over winter appears from underneath . 
  dog poop , dog poop everywhere ... 
   for instance , speed cameras in the uk cost far more to implement than they raised in revenue . 
  the goal was to deter speeding , not to raise money . 
  sadly , it 's not the case in poland . 
  many small towns that have highways passing thru/near them had large percentage of their budget come from speed cameras . 
  they used to refer to them affectionately as `` money-printing machines '' . 
  there were many underhanded techniques going on , like placing mobile speed cameras under camouflage nets , adjusting local traffic signs so that for example there 's a retarded speed limit for 200 metres then it returns to normal , with speed camera inbetween signs , and so on ... as a result , there has been huge backlash against those practices , with many town having their city guard ( often responsible for those schemes ) closed down in referendums , country-wide laws adjusted ( speed cameras have to be painted in bright colors and no longer concealed ) and so on ... 
   does anyone has an explanation as to why pollution spikes in a warm winter ? 
  lack of wind . 
  when temperature stays relatively constant , there 's no pressure difference needed to create wind , so the air stays in one place , accumulating pollution . 
  [ cracow vice-major ( second from left ) denies that air pollution norms have been breached ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8ggglci.jpg ), 
   so poles like pigs ? 
   it 's a bit untranslatable . 
  `` red pig '' in this context is a socialist party member - think pigs from orwell 's `` animal farm '' . 
  that inn has waitresses dressed up in communist youth uniforms from 50s , dishes are named after politicians from previous era and so on ... 
  there 's certain irony in jewish person accusing other minority of drinking blood and calling for their expulsion ... 
   apparently , all things go in cycles ... hipsters nowadays are scavenging their grandmother 's attics to get `` old school '' [ net-bags ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nutms1q.jpg ) . 
  it 's becoming very trendy fashion accessory .
