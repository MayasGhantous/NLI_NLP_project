  it 's first time i 'm hearing about little star and little angel at all . 
  same with baby jesus supposedly giving out presents , but i live in north-eastern poland . 
  just like the map shows , minor characters ( those other than santa claus ) are very regional and do n't overlap with each other . 
  outside of their regions , i think only grandfather frost is remotely recognizable as present-giver , but he 's basically summed up as `` that russian santa claus '' in population 's perception . 
   hell , if they can into eurovision ... 
  i would n't use that one as an argument . 
  we had australia participating this year ... 
  i read interview with ukrainian who immigrated to poland . 
  apparently , he hoped that situation will improve ( he was business owner - running two stores ad coffee shop . 
  ) , but after euromaidan , the same policeman came for `` protection '' bribe as usually , and he even laughed that the amount due will increase from now on , as he got promoted . 
  dude sold his business and moved to poland . 
  he wants to open mobile carts selling hot coffee in winter and cooled soda drinks in summer at bus stations . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hct1clqci3i https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdfebndeqpi those two pretty much sum up the issue for me . 
   `` some of the caricatures ( ... ) reflect a humor that was common in american society , especially when it came to racial and ethnic groups . 
  ** these prejudices were wrong then and are certainly wrong today . 
  ( ... ) removing [ her ] from these collections , would be the same as pretending she never existed ** . 
  the same is for other images and jokes that we would n't normally include in mainstream cartoons today . 
  [ they ] reveal the prejudices of their time , and are presented here to accurately reflect the history that can not and should not be ignored . 
  yes , the wording might suck , but it 's a part of our ( dark ) history , the same way nazi auschwitz camp museum should n't be dismantled , in order to to not hurt someone 's feelings . 
  history , no matter how shitty , should n't be changed , in order to fit current narrative . 
  i do n't want to live in world where ~ ~ we are at war with eurasia ~ ~ we have always been at war with eastasia . 
  that rainbow monument in warsaw already got dismantled . 
  it was burned down around 4 times in total , after 3rd one they sprayed it with some flame-resistant substance ( did n't help ) and after 4th , it got cctv surveillance and permanent city guard patrol . 
  as for flags in this protest , it 's not like lgbt activists get routinely beaten down in poland . 
  more conservative people might not like them , but it usually ends with shouting matches , violence is rarely involved . 
  of course it is , but we 're still `` east '' from `` western '' countries , like for example uk , where easyjet is from . 
  not if you 're living in usa ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you , westerners have your easyjet for 10eur flights , while we , in the east , have our wizzair , that fits same role . 
  yea , `` karta polaka '' ( `` pole 's card '' ) is ridiculously easy to obtain and you get a bunch of perks with it , like residence permit and even tuition-free university . 
  sigh ... they will just move to usa if canada tries to do anything . 
  we had similar problem over here , with `` redwatch '' site ran by neo-nazis ( ? ), 
  that lists photos , addresses and employment locations of various left-leaning activists . 
  when our ministry of interior requested it to be taken down , host based in usa basically replied `` first amendment , motherfuckers . '', 
  i 'd like to see georgia in eu , if only to see your letters on labels , documents and stuff . 
  that alphabet looks awesome . 
   put on the tin foil hat that 's the saddest thing . 
  our newly-elected minister of enviorment actually made an interpelation about chemtrails two years ago . 
  i wish this was a joke ... ( response to said interpelation : http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm7.nsf/interpelacjatresc.xsp?key=53ac31db ), 
   if needed , `` eliminated '' ( dismissal , deprivation of functions , etc. ), 
  well , i , for one , welcome those new humanitarian methods . 
  we used to put them in furnaces and pour molten steel over then . 
  i read response in press release from nato hq in belgium and it apparently is legal and `` internal matter of poland '' . 
  that being said , even sb ( socialist secret service ) was n't raiding homes during nights , 6.00-22 .00 were only allowed hours , barring very special circumstances , so this action is a bit ... 
  [ gib back old borders !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/polish-lithuanian_commonwealth_at_its_maximum_extent.svg ), 
  there are two ways to go around this : illegal one - get a newspaper , open up classfields section , find `` przywracanie miesi\u0105czki '' ( `` restoring period '' ) listing with number next to it . 
  legal one - most of neighboring countries have much less restrictive laws and it 's only a short ride . 
  depending on where you live , czech republic , sweden and germany are most popular . 
  wrong and wrong . 
   because noone from ukraine will go poland or spain to immigrate or steal last two years poland issued over 1,5 milion long-term/employment/student visas to ukraine nationals . 
  they get employed in many low-paid jobs , filling the void left after poles who emigrated west themselves . 
   also poland does not pay anything in the eu poland contributed to 2014 eu budget 3526 million eur , roughly similar amount to that one of sweden or belgium and more than austria or denmark . 
   dhl charges 200 euros for a 4kg package to uk . 
  i know romania is bit further south , but in poland , going rate is around 1gbp/kg for smaller packages and around 20-25gpb for ~ 30kg ones ( just checked dpd site and they have promo - # 13.95 for 31,5 kg ) . 
  for 200eur , you could fly yourself to london with parcel and back . 
  been there , done that . 
  did n't help . 
  poland banned non-otc drugs ads long time ago . 
  the only thing it changed is we got 100s of `` diet supplements '' ads instead , which supposedly help with wide range of issues , starting from sweating , thru cold feet , and ending with urinary incontinence ... 
  that 's pretty much correct . 
  not familiar with industrial applications either , but in banking , most of atms worldwide are running on windows xp . 
  connecting any 3rd party usb drive to computer on internal network is grounds for disciplinary sacking . 
   one of my favorite words in my language is `` culebr\u00f3n '' it literally means `` big snake '' but it 's actually a cheeky slang for soap opera . 
  well ... still beats the `` tasiemiec '' ( lit . 
  `` tapeworm '' ) we use over here ... 
   yeah , but patrol police is the only service that is unbribable . 
  everybody else accepts bribes just like before . 
  small steps , man . 
  i saw how it changed in poland . 
  when i was younger , it was the same over here . 
  as more and more people from old generation , who grew up under communism , retire and get replaced by younger ones who actually want the change , it will gradually get better . 
   2 years since the revolution , yet there 's not a single corruptioneer got arrested . 
  it 's not the most important thing even ( albeit nice if it were to happen ) . 
  most important is public perception - as long as it 's seen as `` normal '' to `` grease the wheels '' and slip envelope to doctor , in order to move up in waiting list , you will have problem . 
  once it becomes socially unacceptable , and people start hushing their illict earnings , instead of bragging about them fireside , that 's when battle is won . 
   do you know how many used the `` right to be forgotten '' ? 
  218 thousands request - data from march 2015 . http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/14/google-accidentally-reveals-right-to-be-forgotten-requests, 
   hirst v united kingdom for those unfamiliar - this is the issue whether convicted inmates should be allowed to vote . 
  echr 's stance was that they should . 
  on unrelated note , it 's always interesting point for our own , polish , tabloids to list whom convicts are voting for . 
  euro football championships in poland turned out great on all fronts ( great short and long-term tourism boost , as well as in terms of `` image '' - people came expecting run-down gray commie blocks and saw vibrant european cities with friendly people ) , but we nope 'd out of hosting winter olympics ( cracow + zakopane were bidding , but we withdrawn after a referendum , where majority of population voted `` no '' ) . 
  that `` l '' in circle is a logo of [ legia warszawa ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/legia_warszawa_ ( pi\u0142ka_no\u017cna \\ ) ) , local football team . 
  author of that image was probably going for `` beaten up soccer hooligan '' angle . 
  how does one spell `` flughafenfeuerwehrsimulator '' ?? 
  this stuff sounds like that [ `` safe word '' from eurotrip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxcpbsdipnc ), 
  [ polish parish took in refugees from syria but they ran away to germany . 
  `` we gave them a home and a job . 
  do n't be cruel . 
  this is staple street food in eastern europe . 
  media had a field day here over picture of anti-immigration protesters queuing up in front of kebab booth right after march . 
  good for turkey then . 
  after russia banned our apples , we recorded record-high exports last year . 
   that was a mistake that 's probably the saddest thing in all this . 
  i see how much in my country changed in 25 years and how little ukraine improved . 
  when we both started out , with freshly regained independence , we were very similar in terms of population breakdown , industry outlooks and natural resources . 
  heck , ukraine 's gdp per capita ppp was even slightly higher than ours ... as much as i like to hang dogs on our politicans , at least they had a vision and consequently realized it . 
  so would i. 
  the problem is - appeasement politics do n't always work , and sometimes one has to put foot down . 
  i 'm convinced there would be no `` green men '' in ukraine , if west behaved more sternly after georgian war . 
   under a classical form of dictatorship people usually do n't vote , because they ca n't , north korea has elections too ...
