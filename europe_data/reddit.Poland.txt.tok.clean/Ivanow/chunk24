  i would n't call putin a `` dictator '' in old sense of that word , but he 's definetely one in more `` modern '' sense . 
  he is effectively ruling , with other constitutional bodies ( army , judges , parliament and so on ... ) being puppets in his hands . 
  he could 've dissolved duma tomorrow and proclaim himself tzar , and i do n't think much would change . 
  he has popular support and he is what 's keeping country together - without him , it 'd be various factions and private armies of oligarchs fighting each other . 
  personally , i do n't mind russian troops at border . 
  on cloudless day , i see kaliningrad ~ ~ oblyat ~ ~ oblast , which is basically glorified military base , border from home . 
  they just have to stay on their side of border . 
  they are no longer fake . 
  i think netherlands `` stole '' the designs and built those bridges .

  bit lost in translation . 
  what szyd\u0142o said was `` przyj\u0119li\u015bmy zasad\u0119 ( ... ) , \u017ce wypowied\u017a po posiedzeniu polskiego rz\u0105du b\u0119dziemy realizowa\u0107 na najpi\u0119kniejszych , moim zdaniem , bia\u0142o-czerwonych flagach '' which more correctly translates to `` we adopted a policy ( ... ) , that speech after polish government gathering will be realized on most beautiful , in my own opinion , white-red flags '' . 
  sounds very similar , but the tone is much milder/less confrontational than tabloids make it to be . 
  some places are closer than 12miles . 
  we have similar situation with `` exclusive economic area '' on baltic sea , where it overlaps with denmark and sweden , but those got sorted out by diplomats , not generals with hard-on for powerful navy/airforce . 
  from what i 've read before , both turkey and greece have their own version of `` airspace '' over disputed areas and count flybys over those areas as violations . 
  it 's nice that they caught him already . 
  i was curious how that one will end . 
  anyone got hurt ? 
  also , it 's police guys who should be punished for leaving firearm unattended ( just like some armies do - [ lost id card ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vf642q9.jpg ) , [ lost firearm ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9oaud5d.jpg ) ) , no need to drag minister of interior into this . 
  let 's call it ... ** commonwealth ** . 
  wo n't fit on the screen . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp-growth-annual -4,1 % - bar would have to be 7 times longer than finland 's . 
  blame the gypsies ( or rather - media in 90s who called them `` romanians '' ) . 
  it 's still the first thing that comes to people 's minds when asked about it . 
  luckily , it 's improving , as more people travel abroad . 
  he 's actually quite correct ( should use `` ussr '' instead of `` russia '' , but well ... ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet\u2013afghan_war is basically what turned that country into shithole in first place . 
  tbh , it 's not only war refugees , but also economic migrants from ukraine , that we have no problems with . 
  actual refugees are relatively rare , but in total we got more immigrants from ukraine past two years than almost entire little eesti population ( 1,2 mil long-term visas issued , no idea about illegal ones ) , and almost no-one blinked an eye . 
  they are very educated and fill the void that poles who emigrated west left . 
  occasional shitheads get kicked out immediately . 
  so ... why do n't russia and usa take afghani refugees ? 
  what does german taxpayer have to do with this ? 
  we have nothing to do with current dictatorship in eritrea . 
  it 's eritreans shitting on other eritreans out there . 
  it was their war with ethiopia that wrecked their current infrastructure . 
  i do n't dispute need for increased presence in mediterranean and adriatic , but i can vouch for quality of border service we have in poland . 
  in addition to that , every person with darker skin stands out like a sore thumb here , and it 'd be impossible to travel across entire country without getting caught . 
  i 'm sure those funds would be better used down south . 
  drawing a straight line from eritrea , there are nine other countries between it and germany , even more from afghanistan . 
  why should european taxpayer have to support every miserable human being in the world ? 
  well , he says `` east '' , not `` south '' , where the reason dictates such curtain against islamic extremism should be . 
  poland did n't vote against either . 
  we 're talking about overall sentiment of population in this thread . 
  gulf states do n't want them either . 
   if the said group of four central european countries ca n't compromise like the rest 24 eu states i 'm pretty sure there are less than 24 willing to admit more immigrants . 
  out of top of my head , baltics , finland , romania and uk are also against , which results in 20-8 split , and i 'm sure some other `` western '' countries are debatable , especially after attack in france , which would put germany + sweden bloc in minority . 
  what then ? 
  i 'd say it 's more about distinction that is made over here between `` refugees '' and `` immigrants '' - media do n't use them interchangeably , and we have no problems accepting real refugees , especially given our country history ( [ polish refugees in persia , 1943 - oh , how the times have changed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpjvdqvx_dc ) ) , we simply do n't want economic migrants . 
  you 'd get completely different results , depending on how you phrase the question .

  airport security in egypt is a joke . 
  i bribed customs guy at scanner with freakin 0.10 $ ballpoint pen , to let me get 2l juice container onboard without checking . 
  if it contained anything remotely explosive , instead of juice , it 'd be enough to tear a hole big enough to cause rapid decompression . 
   even then the most successful of the immigrant groups still have an employment rate of ~ 65 % , vs. 83 % for swedes . 
  does this statistic include immigrants from eu countries ? 
  in netherlands only 2 % of polish immigrants receive any welfare ( versus 3,1 % for native population and 40-70 % for african , middle east immigrants ) . 
  i could n't find similar data for sweden , but i 'd be surprised if it were so different . 
  you have n't seen the exploding beer can and boiling sausages conferences ? 
  that movie is the proof . 
  wake up , sheepie !, 
   wants google to pay for using our network . 
  that 's basically an essence of `` net neutrality '' issue that 's been going on in usa . 
  providers want to `` double dip '' and charge both end customers and website owners for the same resource . 
  not in poland . 
  we do n't have russian minority that needs protection ( 5k out of 38,5 million declared themselves as `` russian '' , 5 k as `` polish-russian '' and 1 more thousand as `` russian + different ethnicity ( ukrainian , belorussian etc. ), 
  - data from 2011 census . 
  to be honest , our russian minority wants to have nothing to do with russia at all . 
  most of them are either descendants of nobility that ran away from bolsheviks , people who got tired of systemic corruption and oligarchy , and last , but not least - mafia members doing shady business . 
  am i missing something here ? 
  sharm el-sheikh and hurghanda are huge tourist destinations for eastern europeans on a budget . 
  there are literally entire streets with shop signs in cyrlic in hurghanda . 
  income from tourism is 2nd biggest source of revenue for egypt ( with first being suez channel transit fees ) , and if this attack results in anything similar to what happened in tunis , with airlines and tour operators canceling that destination , egypt 's economy gon na take a huge hit . 
  snow loses all it 's charm once you 're past the age of 15 . 
  then it becomes a huge pain in ass . 
  i was complaining about snow starting falling , while my friend from warmer country said how he wished they had snow too - he 'd do snowball fights , build an igloo and so on ... 
  in reality , he 'd probably have fun for first few days , while he 'd spend remaining months of winter cursing , as he has to get up 20 minutes earlier , in order to dig out the car on the parking lot from snow that accumulated overnight ... 
  300eur + housing . 
  last time ukraine signed disarmament treaty , it did n't end well ... 
  refugee stipend in poland is roughly 300eur/month . 
  i 'm pretty sure most will happily resign from it , and opt for working under table/stealing/begging in germany instead , as evidenced by actions of refugees who already arrived here , and left overnight , without even saying `` thank you '' . 
   poles have as much a right to be in the uk as syrians do to be in poland . 
  this is actually untrue . 
  both poland and uk are members of eu , which gives us certain rights , one of them being `` freedom of movement '' , which lets us live in any member county we chose , the same way a texan can pack his stuff and move to new york , if he so desires . 
  to get from syria to poland , one has to pass a dozen `` safe '' ( as per un definition ) countries , which makes them automatically ineligible for refugee status in poland . 
  how do you see poland forcing refugees to stay over here , instead of running back to germany , even illegally ( begging in germany pays better than mcjob in poland , and that 's about the only job unqualified migrant will be able to take ) . 
  we flown over 160 people from syria few months ago . 
  as of now , over half of them already `` escaped '' west . 
  we 're supposed to put newly-allocated migrants from quota into prisons ? 
  but there 's no fun in that . 
  you ca n't have proper revolution without guillotines ... 
   the protest now tho is becoming more about bigger things , change of political class . 
  well , solidarity movement and gda\u0144sk shipyard strikes started in response to meat prices rising announcement , and we ended up accidentally a system . 
  apparently that 's how things work in eastern europe ... 
  ... heads will fall ? 
  i 'd say they are a part of polish culture in first place . 
  ukraine used to be a part of polish-lithuanian commonwealth for hundreds of years . 
  one of most famous literature works here describes love triangle between polish nobleman , ukrainian princess and cossack during khmelnytsky uprising . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/with_fire_and_sword ) generally , it 's very similar situation to what happened when poles emigrated west , to uk or ireland . 
  you notice `` foreign '' language spoken more often in public places , but it 's hard to say someone is immigrant on first glance .
