  they work hard , doing low-paid jobs that poles do n't want to do , learn the language and send their kids to polish schools . 
  crime rates are no different than native population . 
  die-hard nationalists scream `` they took our jobs !, 
  '' , as pretty much everywhere , but general population has no problems with them . 
   i can not imagine him closing the door in front of ukrainians or armenians , for example . 
  poland got 1.100.000 ( yes , over one million ) immigrants from ukraine in past 18 months and absolutely no-one is complaining . 
  i call bullshit on that one . 
  could n't find a thing about it in any polish media , neither on szyd\u0142o 's or pis 's pages . 
  it also makes no sense whatsoever - pis is almost fanatically anti-russian , and supports both ukraine and georgia in their conflicts . 
  getting any money out of ukraine nowadays would be kinda like sending collection agency after homeless man . 
  to be fair , most of those are tabloids , and they are known for `` shocking '' and `` clickbait ` y '' huge front page titles . 
  guardian , times and independent are much more toned-down . 
  rebels ( notice the wording , it does n't say `` russia '' anywhere ) did try to cut the links ( ( in ) famous tweet removal ) , and pro-verbal `` fingers '' were initially pointed at putin , as the one supplying rebels with weaponry capable of shooting planes 10km high . 
  https://petitions.whitehouse.gov getting 100.000 signatures requires white house to issue official response . 
  i 'm not familiar with usa system ( only heard about `` we , the people '' white house website , which works in similar , but less formalized , way ) , but the goal of those initiatives is to propose new laws and get government to discuss them . 
  for example , in poland there are 3 ways law proposal can come under discussion ( local law , not eu-wide one . 
  other european countries have similar systems in place ) : 1 ) party currently in parliament , or `` loose '' 15 representatives can propose bill ( this is most common way new laws get created ) 2 ) president , as a kind of `` people 's representative '' who got enough support to get elected in first place can propose one 3 ) citizens can start and initiative and if they get 500.000 signatures within certain time period ( 3 months ? 
  cba 'd to check ) , parliament should put it for discussion ( this one is a bit controversial , and mis-treatment of two recent initiatives is one of factors that led to former ruling party dismissal in latest elections ) note that none of above automatically means that the law get passed - it simply puts it under discussion . 
   what happened in uk in between 1980 and 1996 ? 
  mad cow disease ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy ), 
  in poland you 're also banned for life if you traveled to uk while mad cow epidemic was going on . 
  full study : http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054360 now that one thinks about it , it makes sense that the flow was from india to europe , not the other way around , since back when that haplogroup developed , [ half of my current country area was still under glacier ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zlodowacenie_p\u00f3\u0142nocnopolskie#/media/file:lgm-mangerud-2003.jpg ) ... 
   sure , but by that logic northern indians should be repatriated to their place of historical origin which is ukraine . 
  it 's actually the other way around . 
  there are some genetic studies that place origin of proto-slavs in northern india ( as traced by r1a haplogroup ) . 
  ( almost ) no-one in eastern europe has a problem with accepting genuine refugees . 
  we just do n't want economic migrants , since we have enough of our own poor people that needs to be taken care of . 
  he was probably referring to `` land quality '' , not land area . 
  ukraine 's arable land is chernozem , the most fertile kind on earth . 
  back when ukraine was a province of poland , we made a killing , by exporting crops grown there to netherlands . 
  it was strong in 90s in pretty much every country east of former iron curtain . 
  experienced policemen and agents got fired in a kind of anti-communist purges ( for example in poland , 3595 out of 14038 got sacked ) and replaced with green , inexperienced cadets freshly out of school ... now , if your only job skill is interrogation , you might have problems finding employment , so it was natural that those people turned to crime eventually . 
  few years later they started fighting each other over spheres of infulence , and now-experienced young policemen rolled them over and put in nice jumpsuits ( at least those who were still alive after brutal gang wars ) . 
  at least that was the case in poland and baltic states . 
  ukraine was n't so lucky . 
  switzerland has been phased out from tax-evasion corporate structures for few years already . 
  ras al-khaimah seems like the go-to country for europeans who want to hide their wealth nowadays . 
  well , poland is kind of poster child of post-soviet transformation . 
  [ in 1989 average ukrainian was richer than average pole , nowadays we 're passing 5 times higher income mark . 
  i think it 's mostly to do with uah < -  usd exchange ratio . 
  hryvna was worst performing currency of 2014 , and with losing over 50 % of value , many people who were slightly above the line , which uses usd values , coupled with inflation , suddenly found themselves below the line . 
  interesting fact : minimum wage for textile sweatshop worker in cambodia is 128 $ now [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/cambodia-sets-minimum-wage-below-union-demands-1415789944 ) . 
  average wage in ukraine is 3500 uah ( 152 $ ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://index.minfin.com.ua/index/average/ ) . 
  seriously , what the fuck ? 
  ... which is kinda amusing , as my voivodeship ( warminsko-mazurskie ) is huge recipient of both structural ( driving around my hometown is clusterfuck now , since like 1/3 of roads are closed/throttled due to ongoing construction works ) and cap ( our region is traditionally focused on agriculture and tourism ) funds , yet it seems to have bleaker colour than neighboring ones . 
   russia ranked as low as 120th in the world in 2011 . 
  well ... once you hit rock bottom , the only way leads up . 
   the big jump in ratings raised russia from 62nd place worldwide to 51st place ... which means russia got squeezed between montenegro and thailand above and moldova and colombia below . 
  such elite club . 
   and russia 's public debt is < 30 % so they can borrow cheap if they want to . 
  russia also defaulted twice since the fall of soviet union . 
  current 10y bonds are 10.06 % . 
  for comparison , usa 's 2.06 % , germany 's 0.50 % , and greece 's 7.62 % . 
  the only countries that have to borrow more expensively than russia atm are : kenya ( 15.58 ) , nigeria ( 13.55 ) , and venezuela ( 10.51 ) . 
   according to polls , most of them plain hate us . 
  poland dislikes russia as a country with passion , but this sentiment does n't extend to russians themselves . 
  many people are actually worried about current state of affairs . 
   communism heritage ( its was illegal etc ) this is actually untrue . 
  poland is the only country in europe where there never were any `` sodomy '' laws in 1000 years of history . 
  for comparison , gay sex was illegal in sweden until 1944 . 
  communist official stance was kinda `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' . 
  i recall two cases where left-wing parties were given a chance in post-communist poland , and they squandered it spectacularly in both cases . 
  sld won elections in 2001 with 42 % of votes . 
  after 4 years of governing , with plenty of corruption scandals , they dropped to 11 % . 
  party itself is spiritual successor of pzpr - communist party that was ruling in poland until 1989 . 
  most of older sld members have roots in that period and kinda represent `` champagne socialism '' - high-ranking sld members were often jokingly called `` local barons '' . 
  there was an effort to put the old generation in `` back seat '' and present `` fresh face '' / `` modern left '' to voters like three times already , but it failed every time , and matters always return to equilibrium in the end . 
  second interesting case study would be rpp/tr - very liberal party who got 10 % of votes in 2011 elections with programme of cannabis legalization , lgbt rights , separation of church and state and so on ... 
  they did n't change a thing , and their antics , like press conferences with guns and dildos defined new low in state of polish politics . 
  in latest 2015 presidential elections , their candidate got 1,5 % votes . 
  given such track record , it 's no wonder people are distrustful . 
  your elections got mentioned in polish newspapers ' live threads . 
  apparently there was some trouble in mariupol . 
  40minutes before voting start the cards were still at printer http://i.imgur.com/fppy8zp.jpg, 
  16,47 % voters turnout at 12.00 . 
  higher than previous elections . 
  https://twitter.com/radiozet_news/status/658227172344229888 - drunk election commission member in ko\u0142obrzeg got immediately replaced . 
  voting have n't been interrupted . 
  fire in one of voting places in biskupin . 
  voting there was paused for 1,5 hours , no-one got hurt . 
  pkw ( body responsible for voting process ) announced on press conference that this incident wo n't affect closing time , and electoral silence wo n't be extended . 
  ( in previous presidential election initial result announcement got pushed by an hour , from 8pm to 9pm , as a result of elderly person dying from heart attack while casting a vote , which disrupted voting ), 
  google doodle ( image on search engine 's front page ) in poland , encouraging to vote in elections : http://i.imgur.com/oj3heis.jpg . 
  facebook has a box with reminder as well : http://i.imgur.com/zr6wqhc.jpg ( caption reads `` today is election day . 
  went to vote ? 
  share it . '', 
   will ( if they follow laws ) what laws exactly , are you referring to here ? 
  to my knowledge , the only laws regarding refugees we agreed to , is dublin 2 treaty , which is actually closely followed by all ee countries ( even if hungary gets flak for actually implementing it ) . 
  if you want to pass some new laws , then you need to follow outlined procedures , including getting qualified majority of votes for proposed changes . 
  there are no refugees in hungary . 
  every country it borders is `` safe '' one . 
  this article makes it out like not adopting euro is some of pis 's talking points . 
  literally no-one wants to adopt euro anytime soon - while the reasons for refusal vary , and include some like loss of fiscal sovereignty , making our industry less competitive , price hike due to unfavourable exchange ratio employed during the transition and so on . 
  current approval of accepting euro at all is 70 % against , 25 % for , 5 % undecided . 
  even supporters do n't want it sooner than 2020 . 
  even po 's stance on accepting euro is `` when it suits us '' . 
  they arrived here either as cultural exchange/industrial training of `` brotherly nations '' ( soviet bloc ) in 70s-80s , or in early 90s , when they made small fortunes selling china-made goods ( clothes , electronics etc. ), 
  on bazaars in early transformation period . 
  nope , every citizen of eu country has the right to move/live in any other member state , by virtue of his citizenship ( the so-called `` freedom of movement '' ) . 
  schengen treaty simply goes one step further by eliminating border checkpoints completely on inner borders .
