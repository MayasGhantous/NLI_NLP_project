  for example uk does n't belong to schengen , but few hundred thousands poles moved there - you simply need to present your id at the border . 
  that is somehow correct . 
  in past 1,5 year we issued roughly 1,1 milion long term ( 1-5 years ) visas to ukrainians , and barring few occasional cases of shitheads waving upa flags , we have absolutely no problems with them . 
  it 's not racial thing either , as we have decent population of vietnamese immigrants , who integrate quickly ( second-generation usually see themselves as `` poles '' first , sometimes adding `` of vietnamese origin '' ) and work hard - outside of very extreme right , people have no problem with them . 
  high failure rate is very common across the globe among startups . 
  it 's simply due to nature of market - even if most fail , the ones that struck gold will make share holders rich for life , take a look at facebook , skype ... angel investors in silicon valley expect 1 in 16 of startups they invest in to turn a profit . 
  notice the graphs at the bottom of article . 
  it specifically mentions `` worker '' and as you can see - we have no problem with those . 
  the reason eastern europeans oppose so strongly to recent immigration from south is because we do n't see them as `` refugees '' but rather `` welfare shoppers '' , and their antics , like unwilling to get registered in `` poorer '' countries , or even get out of buses in small towns of sweden or germany , as shown in our press , definitely do n't help that image . 
  yup . 
  my bad . 
  i wrote that comment at 5am . 
  rather than usual left-right axis , it 's better to picture parties ' political stance as graph with two axises - one for economic stance ( capitalism vs ~ ~ liberalism ~ ~ socialism ) while other plots `` morality '' ( birth control , drug legalization , religion ) . 
  over here party can be both right-wing in `` morality '' sense ( `` traditional christian values '' etc. ), 
  and left-wing in economic sense ( support of welfare state , high taxes etc. ), 
  at the same time , without contradiction . 
   although someone should check that malaysia airlines is n't missing anything . . dude ... 
  why we did n't have sticky belarus election megathread over here ? 
  protip : it 's not rich who pays the highest taxes . 
  i have a friend who makes 11k $ / mo , which would theoretically put him in highest income bracket in poland ( 32 % ) . 
  he 's paying 8,5 % , completely legal . 
  if your income is high enough , you can afford good accountant and tax advisor . 
  poland is twice as generous , with 183 days threshold ( ^ ( invest plz ) ) . 
  on more serious note , it 's usa who 's the odd one , with taxing all their citizens , no matter the residency . 
  most countries in the world require you to be actually present on it 's soil for some part of year before you have to pay taxes . 
   yeah . 
  it felt like all of this was a test of sorts . 
  tribes make you walk on burning coals , civilized nations set you on a quest to collect artifacts papers and endure sleep deprivation . 
  like a rite of passage .

  elections in poland in 19 days ... 
  this is gon na be glorious ... 
  but ... actual sugar is hard to come by , thanks to some lobbying . 
  i was under impression you guys use high fructose corn syrup for everything . 
   keep buying russian , and kgb will one early morning knock on your door . 
  last year someone in ukraine made pretty good video/ad about it . 
  http://swiat.newsweek.pl/ladujac-koszyk-ladujesz-rosyjskie-karabiny-wideo-newsweek-pl,film,285396.html it says `` think what you 're buying . 
  do n't sponsor war '' . 
  we 're not telling them to die . 
  they should simply adapt - if milk production has shitty profit margins , maybe they should move to beef production , or plant corn ... 
  when 2008 crisis hit , many people lost their jobs , but they did n't go to warsaw to burn some tires and scream `` i do n't want anything to change . 
  gib me money '' - they either accepted different job , below their qualifications , or started small business themselves . 
  only professions that always stir trouble when something goes against their wishes are farmers and miners . 
  every other industry has to adapt when market changes . 
  why should farmers get special treatment ? 
   in this specific case it seems that the doing away of quotas and the russian embargo have had a direct impact on the suicide rate . 
  polish farmers got hit the hardest by embargo , but rather than sitting on ass and whining ( which tbh , we had a fair share of last year ) , and petitioning brussels to help , they went ahead and found new markets for their produce , [ like india ] ( http://msp.gov.pl/en/polish-economy/economic-news/6333,poland-set-to-promote-food-exports-this-year-also-in-india.html ), 
  it 's not really that hard , since most of them sound very similar in polish and english , sometimes just spelled a bit differently , due to language sounds differences . 
  on a quick glance on european map from sidebar , the only countries that have name completely different in polish than in english are germany ( `` niemcy '' ) and italy ( `` w\u0142ochy '' ( `` hairy ones '' ? ), 
  poland is pretty `` bland '' when it comes to food . 
  only `` controversial '' food i could think of , are [ `` kaszanka '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaszanka ) ( sausage with blood and buckwheat ) , [ `` flaczki '' soup ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/flaki_%28potrawa%29 ) ( made out of beef intestines cut in stripes ) and [ `` czernina '' soup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czernina ) from duck blood . 
  some people in the west find pickles odd , but those kind of entered mainstream by now . 
  [ you forgot one ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r129lmt.jpg ), 
  i stand corrected then . 
  my bad . 
  here 's the fun part ... amazon has distribution centres in poland ( they had a row with workers ' unions in germany who threatened a strike in pre-christmass season ) . 
  one is already operating ( 95000 m ^ 2 of space ) , second one is being built and third one is planned . 
  now , if only someone could explain to me why shipping from poland to germany is free , while i have to pay 29eur for poland to poland shipment ? 
  for 29eur i can ride a bus to berlin and back ... 
  wrong . 
  i would n't shed a tear if it affected oligarchs and politicians only , but i have no beef with ordinary russian citizens . 
  i do n't imagine many eastern europeans would wish misery to common folks , especially if they experienced it themselves , and know how much it sucks . 
  it 's not about money ... poking fun about someone being poor would be really shitty move . 
  also , poland was n't exactly rich in 90s too ... what i 'm having issue with is entire clusterfuck of events and carefree approach that almost led to 70-something nuclear reactors almost melting down at once . 
  can you imagine what a disaster would that be ? 
  well , it 's not ideal solution , but since the pay they are receiving it 's shit in first place ( they get probably like 100-200eur / month each ) and if it reduces piracy rates in region , it might turn out to be net-gain for eu due to savings by european shipping companies on escort , ransoms , military presence costs etc. 
  not to mention goodwill and `` soft power '' . 
  [ friendly reminder that in 1995 some of those submarines almost had reactor meltdown after local power plant cut off energy supply to base the subs were docked at , due to unpaid utility bills . 
  ] ( https://www.wiseinternational.org/nuclear-monitor/441/naval-base-escapes-disaster ), 
  microsoft got slapped by huge fines couple of years ago and forced to change some practices ( eu is the reason you 're presented by `` which browser you want to use ? '', 
  prompt on fresh windows installations ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure they are going to do something about `` telemetry '' and few other shitty practices from windows 10 , but it takes some time to get case going . 
   i 'll stop giving you money ? 
  western governments are n't giving that money out of goodwill - we opened up our markets in exchange , and your companies are profiting off it greatly . 
  if you break off terms of agreement then do n't be surprised if french carmakers find themselves on receiving end of some new `` tax '' ( renault alone sold 60.000 new cars in poland last year . 
  ) , followed by similar tax for french supermarket chains ( e.leclerc - 40 stores - more than rest of countries outside of france combined . 
  carrefour - 84 +277 stores . 
  second place after spain ) , it that wo n't be enough , maybe french telecom ? 
  orange poland had 1bln pln profit on cellphones alone , large portion of which got transfered to france due to `` license fees '' ( total french contribution to eu budget that year was 17bln eur ) . 
  money paid by eu to poland via structural and other funds are a tiny fraction of what eu-based companies are earning on polish market . 
   and its highly probable that some countries may not agee . 
  hungary . 
  in 1939 , they told hitler to fuck off and that they 'd rather blow up their rails themselves than allow them to be used for troop transport so that reich could open up second front against poland . 
  somehow , i do n't think eu will have more luck convincing them to betray poland and vote against them . 
  and that 's exactly what we 're talking about ... * you have to acknowledge that estonia oppressing it 's russian minority does n't really encourage western europe to spill their own blood for them * we have a saying , roughly translatable to `` when one wants to beat a dog , a stick can always be found '' - what guarantees we have that after ceding national army , in favor of eu one , it wo n't get mired by western politicians sending `` deep concerns '' instead of bullets , if baltics get attacked ? 
   perhaps there is , but they are not as good at branding there are aplenty - especially wind turbines market is pretty much monopolized by european companies , with danish vestas and german enercon at the top , they are just not household names , for obvious reasons . 
  it 's complicated . 
  basically , under communist system , you have one ruling party , but they can have vastly different policies in different time periods . 
  if you compare policies that ussr politburo had under stalin ( 1934 -- 1953 ) to ones during perestroika/glasnost ( 1985-1991 ) , it 's basically day and night , despite both being technically one government . 
  same with china - compare policies from cultural revolution or great leap forward , to ones china has today , and most would agree that current party is only `` communist '' in name - best way to uphold chairman mao 's legacy is to own as many banknotes with his face printed as possible . 
   and the philae blunder was caused by failure of landing thrusters built by a dutch company . 
  was n't philae issues caused by anchor not firing ? 
  i recall people joking that that 's what you get when you get landlocked country ( austria ) design one . 
   how similar are the languages and how easy is it for ukrainians to learn ? 
  very similar - closer than between ukrainian and russian . 
  as long as person speaks reasonably slowly , you can understand most of sentences . 
   i know there 's been cooperation for a long time , but given the immigration to poland and the state of affairs in ukraine , is there any sort of cultural exchange the other way ? 
  tourism ? 
  trade ? 
  academic and culture ?
