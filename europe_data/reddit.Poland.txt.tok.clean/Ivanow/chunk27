  it 's kinda one-sided for now tbh . 
  in trade , poland exports a lot of goods to ukraine , but it 's difficult other way around , as their companies lack needed certificates and other criteria to enter eu markets . 
  for now , out of ukrainian goods , i 'm only seeing that `` flavored dried bread '' kind of chips/snacks - they are four times more expensive over here than the same ones i saw in kyiv - it was 8-9 uah , while they cost around 4-5 pln ( 35-40 uah ) in our stores , but they seem to sell quite well - often most popular flavors are sold out . 
  for tourism , a lot of ukrainians visit poland , and now wizzair is opening new line warsaw-kyiv , so it should increase even more . 
  poles seem to prefer bulgaria for ultra-low costs vacations , shying away from ukraine due to fear of corrupt customs officers/police shakedowns and perceived `` danger '' of war outbreak . 
  my own family called me mad , when i told them i 'm flying to odessa for three weeks . 
  their pr could really use improvement . 
  as for academic and culture , no idea . 
   poles are n't welcoming to non slavs no-one , absolutely no-one , has any problems with our growing vietnamese-polish minority . 
   maybe romanian politicians were too wimpy and listened ? 
  romanian government agreed to create it as one of requirement to increase eu funds flow , thinking they will quickly be able to subjugate the anti-corruption agency , by filling it with `` their '' people , and turning it into some puppet body . 
  once the hounds were out , and people started getting jailed , they tried to limit it 's power , but by then , agency already had huge support from both eu itself , and more importantly - romanian public , and became untouchable . 
  they pretty much tied the knot that will be used to hang them . 
  both , at least in poland . 
  basically , in polish people republic , celebrations were still observed ( including day-off ) , but communist party did n't like `` saints '' in name , due to anti-religion stance , so they used `` dead '' instead . 
  it 's used pretty much interchangeably nowadays . 
  i 'm not sure how it works in that situation , but ca n't you get billed if you do retarded shit ( like drunk driving ) and get injured in the process ? 
  amateur boxing matches require extra insurance , while in theory , it should be covered by public health service , if that was the case ... 
   to prevent more injuries or even deaths the owner of the castle had to hire a security firm . 
  we have plenty of buildings like those . 
  just put up warning signs up , and if people want to explore and get injured in the process , it 's their problem . 
   will be able to stay on due to many years of employment and can eventually get citizenship . 
  the question is , will they want to stay ? . . 
  even putting anti-immigration rhetoric aside , when even after obtaining citizenship , they would be second-class citizens in eyes of large portion of population - as wages in poland rise and pound is nosediving , economic pull factor is disappearing as well . 
   how many of those ukrainian refugees come from a war zone i assume , similar percentage to those of `` refugees '' in western europe , many of which are coming from such war-torn countries as morocco or pakistan ... 
  i 'm not sure if that 's the kind of union i want to be a part of . 
  not that long ago , we were members of different `` union '' , which sent out tanks with `` brotherly help '' when it 's members wanted to leave it ... 
  membership should be based on mutual benefits each member receives from cooperation , not threat of force . 
  if agreement did n't work out for them , it should be learning experience for other members on how they could improve it in future . 
   is there heavy industry ? 
  make a guess . 
   not sure if ukraine 's pay is good enough to allow for the same thing to happen there . 
  after recent hryvna exchange rate plunge , ukraine has similar wages to cambodia . 
  i 've seen ads on bus stops in odessa for skilled construction workers ( carpenters etc. ), 
  that offer 8000 uah/month fulltime - that 's 280 eur , and jobs that require no qualification ( store clerk and mall security were the one listed on same poster ) pay half of that . 
  mexicans are honorary europeans . 
  hover over our map in top-right corner for proof . 
  great idea . 
  any volounteers ? 
  i tried looking for some info about it , but there 's so much `` noise '' with news articles and changes over the years , that i was unable to return with anything concrete . 
  as it stands now , agreement was signed that allows polish non-official vessels ( ie no coast guard , police etc. ), 
  to cross it ( with drawbacks that it does n't include any foreign vessel that would wish to bring cargo to polish port , and with russia reserving right to withdraw permission at any time ) - for some time , ships/yachts had to stop at kaliningrad port and undergo customs check and pay port fees , even if they were only passing , which poland called `` outrageous '' , but it mostly surfaces in old news articles from circa 2005 , so it might 've been repealed by now . 
  i swear , that was best spent 70k eur in history of advertising . 
  i hate how this sub handles those crisises - many valuable contributors from greece/russia and now uk , get chased away , resulting in circlejerky comments how greece/russia/uk is lazy/evil/doomed , with users ' from those countries arguments/different perspective getting drown out with downvotes into obvilion . 
  anyone remembers `` freedom apples '' two years ago ? 
  polish exports to russia were massive , especially in food sector - export to russia decreased by 31,4 % ( sic ! ), 
  in 2015 well , the funny thing is - 2015 was another record-high year for polish exports ( 7,7 % raise y/y ) - despite losing one of largest markets , they simply found new ones - uae apple imports from poland rose from 3k tonnes in 2014 to 20k tonnes in 2015 ... you get the idea .

  it 's a tabloid , roughly equivalent to german `` bild '' . 
  compared to stories about aliens abducting cows or exploding tea kettles , tyson playing polish hero is pretty high on plausibility scale . 
   one ca n't abdicate in favour of her grandson , second in line to the throne , when the heir apparent , her son , is still alive . 
  granted , we did n't have hereditary king in over 500 years , but is n't the whole point of being king/queen not being told you `` ca n't '' do something ? 
  that 's exactly the point he 's making . 
  you have country of ~ 60mln people that has gdp equal to hypothetical 2bln population superstate . 
   i would n't bet on eastern europe too much though . 
  poland , and other eastern european countries were proposing it for long time , but it used to be stonewalled by western countries . 
  i recall there were even projects of `` v4 army '' and other pan-regional initiatives , in absence of `` full '' eu army . 
  generally , slavs are n't pacifists , and most of population would n't have problem sending own troops to , for example , mali , as long as public opinion could be presented with reasonable `` just '' cause ( un mandate - see kosovo peacekeeping , `` credible '' wmd intel - see iraq war etc. ), 
  or to ensure polish/european interests are protected . 
   the way poland slapped airbus is symptomatic . 
  our current ruling party is ... special . 
   this is not how consumer facing lidl 's employers in poland look like . 
   we may not be in eu but we may still have freedom of movement so it would affect us . 
  montenegro has total population of like 500k ... we have districts in warsaw with almost as many people . 
  i doubt montenegro joining free movement zone would affect uk much ... 
  in poland , retail chains recently started running tv ads about how great it 's working for them ( here 's [ lidl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i6cfhdnzoo ) one ) in addition to usual product ads . 
  biedronka ( largest retailer - 2700 stores , 55000 employees ) gave raises to every employee twice this year ( 12,5 % in february , 150 pln in september ) , followed by similar move by lidl ( 12 % in march ) . 
  more and more companies have trouble finding both qualified and unqualified employees , with most having to offer raises to avoid employees getting poached by competition . 
   it 's moscow times ... did you expect an actually proper title ? 
  they are quoting interfax , which is largest corporate data market and financial intelligence company in russia . 
   read the article ... russian problem is that they 've produced too much wheat . 
  no , their problem is that the wheat they produced is of terrible quality ( 18 % of harvest is suitable to be turned into flour for breadbaking ) . 
  they are considering mixing in fifth grade ( cattle feed ) quality wheat with third grade ( bread flour ) one to make up for it . 
  [ meanwhile in russia ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/news/huge-deficit-in-wheat-supply-threatens-quality-of-russian-bread-55506 ), 
   it seems a step too far it 's not that bad yet . 
  personally , i 'm waiting until foreign workers will be asked to wear armbands . 
  you get that effect on cobblestone / cut stone pathways when there 's sudden drop of temperature combined with strong sunlight - stones exposed to sunlight give out heat , melting snow away , while area between them is colder , letting snow pile up . 
   always was a bit jealous of you germans and other central europeans with your opportunity to easily reach neighbouring countries by car/train . 
  flights are dirt cheap from sweden to poland - ryanair from stockholm to cracow is like 33 eur . 
  photo was taken by user hulajduszatolipa on polish social media site wykop.pl here 's original source : http://www.wykop.pl/wpis/19957375/wczoraj-o-godzinie-19-fusemul-rzucil-haslo-czy-kto/ he also posted a few more pictures there . 
  there is like dozen teslas registered in poland already , mostly owned by young it guys , with no idea what to spend money on . 
  if we had decent infrastructure to support electric cars , potential market is quite large - last year there were 31,5 k sales of new cars from `` premium/luxury brands '' ( mostly bmw , audi and mercedes , but also bentley and ferrari ) ( [ source ] ( https://www.msp.gov.pl/en/polish-economy/economic-news/6169,luxury-cars-gaining-popularity-in-poland.html ) ) most popular model ( volvo xc60 ) , which has sticker price of 229,9 k pln for basic version , sold 2.8 k units , and it costs almost as much as tesla , not even counting nissan leafs which can be bought for like half of that price . 
  thanks , much more exhaustive list , most items are reasonably banned . 
  i mean ... thumbscrews ? 
  who the hell needs that ? ... 
  yes , i read that . 
  like i said , it 's very vague - for example `` firearm '' definitely fulfills criteria of `` instrument of death '' , hence my question . 
  also , spiked batons are popular sight on medieval fairs over here - will those get banned as well , or will similar exemption that allows one to manufacture medieval canon , without going afoul of gun trafficking laws , apply ? 
  since document lacks any attachments with list of items , my questions are : 1 . 
  will it affect bdsm gear ? 
  most common method of capital punishment nowadays is shooting - does it mean arms and ammo sales bans ? 
   rise of fascism if only it was that easy . 
  there is no fascism in many other eastern european countries , but there 's quite popular saying `` it used to be better under communism '' among elderly population out there . 
  here , have different data : http://i.imgur.com/6euoctt.png this is a poll conducted in france , with question `` who contributed the most to defeating nazi germany in ww2 ? 
  '' , made in 1945 , 1994 , and 2004 . 
  as time goes by , facts and opinions get distorted , following day-to-day sympathies . 
  many foreigners are laughing how our government tries to fight phrase `` polish death camps '' , and the intent behind that phrase might be clear for us now , but will it still be as clear-cut 200 years from now ? ... 
   good job that there are tens of millions of people from their early 40s onwards to guide them then . 
  what about 50 years from now ? 
  look at how russian youth idolizes ussr , despite ( or more adequately - due to ) never experiencing it .
