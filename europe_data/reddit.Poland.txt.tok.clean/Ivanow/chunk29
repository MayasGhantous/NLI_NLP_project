   cheaper accomodation in poland , it 's cheaper to fly to mediterranean than to vacation at baltic resorts . 
  peak season room rates in popular resort towns start at 150-200 pln for housing alone - you can easily score all-inclusive vacation offer in greece or spain in same price . 
  military technology and advanced oil drilling ( arctic offshore platforms and deep wells ) is something every ordinary russian apparently needs to go by ... 
  please , enlighten me on how ban on sale of products `` destined for oil exploration and production in waters deeper than 150 meters or in the offshore area north of the arctic circle '' , visa denials and asset freezes of 149 persons from inner putin circle , tourism and import ban for crimea , kicking russia out of g8 and prohibition of long-term loans to five state-owned russian banks hurts ordinary russian citizen ... 
  most of stuff that actually hurts russians ( food embargo , which lead to rising prices and deteriorating quality ( there was movie clip of flammable white cheese making rounds on ru net recently ) are actually self-inflicted by russia . 
  our morning newspapers kinda sucked , as there was n't enough time to prepare and print news - most had speculation whether war is inevitable , based on 31st august developments , including england 's answer to hitler 's demands : [ `` threat to polish independence '' - polish newspaper ] ( http://i.imgur.com/70pk7ej.png ) [ `` will hitler 's stubbornness get broken ? '', 
  - poznan daily ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iz1m9an.png ) [ `` england says `` no '' to hitler demands '' - kujawy daily ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lt2y9ia.png ) [ `` london 's strong refusal to hitler demands '' - bialostok daily ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cqkwh73.png ) [ `` full mobilization in england '' - little daily ] ( http://i.imgur.com/msa9ni9.jpg ) [ `` nation of philosopher or trogolodytes ? '', 
  - kresy daily ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f3nagn9.jpg ) [ `` strong position of peace front '' - poznan courier ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4kv2mf6.png ) [ `` danzig blocks polish communication and port usage '' - proclamator ( ? 
  - no idea how to translate newspaper name ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yfmilli.png ) [ `` incredible lie of hitler 's diplomacy '' - western poland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mwuungv.jpg ) [ `` can madmen setting world on fire be stopped ? '', 
  - good morning ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zjxbftt.png ) [ `` polish delegates invited by danzig senate arrested by gestapo '' - polish voice ] ( http://i.imgur.com/crqfexb.png ) ( there were over 40 daily newspapers in poland , not gon na post every one , but you get the idea ... ) evening issues were much more concrete , with most featuring our president 's proclamation , following the attack : [ `` bandit-like german aggression . 
  atmosphere in kiev feels kinda like 90s in poland for me . 
  it 's hard to point at one thing and go `` look '' , but there 's definitely that feeling that something is brewing out there - young people are very involved in politics - i stayed in hotel located in `` governmental '' district , right next to parliament , and there was some kind of happening , demonstration or event pretty much every day . 
  ukrainian symbols and colors ( blue & yellow ) are everywhere - flags on buildings , posters , sold in shops - they really want to stress out their difference from russia . 
  i saw plenty of eu flags as well - i do n't know how genuine is that ( but i heard girl scream `` this is europe now . 
  watch for pedestrians . '', 
  after getting almost ran over by expensive car that ran red light ) , but the shift from east to west is definitely noticeable . 
  what i did n't like was how heavy guarded everything was - there were those mobile barriers in front of many government buildings , that supposed to prevent trucks ramming in - something you 'd expect in usa diplomatic post in kabul , not middle of country 's capital . 
  walking past those armed guards definitely made me feel uneasy ... 
  i just hope this whole shift westward wo n't end up like czechoslovakia ' 68 . 
   one thing i 'd wish though is that the source was more reliable ... ca n't seem to find reliable sources to back it up unfortunately . 
  about the most trustworthy one is tvp.info - national television 's news channel , but it only says `` gazeta polska reports cellphone range issues in towns on russian border , due to high-power equipment used by russian military ( they do n't say `` jamming '' explicitly , as in `` done on purpose '' ) . 
  we do - as stated above , the kid undergone multiple chemos already and it did n't cure him . 
  now , the kid can either have his eye removed or undergo experimental treatment in usa , which is n't covered by state healthcare . 
  - because we only read about the cases when media is involved - plenty of charity going on without getting reported . 
   if they have $ 4 billion why not just donate it ? 
  they are . 
  kulczyk foundation participates in many charitable endeavors . 
  quick scan of various news articles indicate that they are mostly involved in natural disaster relief - earthquake in nepal , tsunami in philippines etc. 
  you need to understand that there 's a bit different approach to charity over here , compared to west - in usa billionaires give human-sized cheques in front of cameras , using it for pr . 
  over here , giving is much more genuine , but also secretive - in 2008 , solorz-\u017bak ( another wealthy businessmen ) gave $ 100mm to cardio clinic in monachium for some research - absolutely no-one knew about it , until few months later doctors from clinic spilled the beans by accident . 
  as for why they `` take '' something in return ( which is not really the case - most likely the medal will return to sportsman , just like previous auction ) - it 's two-fold - serves as kind of `` vetting '' process - if word got around that they give money away to everyone that asks for it , they 'd get buried under letters within a week . 
  second one is `` newsworthiness '' - media does n't write articles about someone donating $ 200k to some charity , as it happens daily , and it 's not worth reporting , but as soon as olympic medal gets involved , it 's suddenly viral piece , even if the medal in question does n't actually change owner . 
  undisclosed amount - wealthy people in poland are notoriously anal about their privacy - maybe some details surface later , but they donated 184150 pln on gofundme site ( it was n't set as `` flexible funding '' so it closed after reaching 100 % ) - not sure if that transfer is for medal or in addition to it . 
   i would think it 's not worth more if you did n't earn it ... why are people paying millions of dollars for renaissance paintings , if they did n't paint them themselves ? 
  that kid has been battling cancer for 20 months already , had numerous chemotherapies , funded by our health service , but they did n't help . 
  that 's why desperate parents want to send him to new york - they ran out of options back home . 
  alright , some more details : - medal was `` bought '' by kulczyk family - wealthiest businessmen in poland ( net worth of around $ 4bil , died last year ) - similar `` sale '' happened after london olympics - kulczyk `` bought '' bronze medal of zofia klepacka ( windsurfing ) for ~ 25k eur to fund treatment of 5yo girl with cystic fibrosis - sportswoman 's neighbor . 
  he gave the medal back to her afterwards . 
  - 3yo boy from that article 's cancer is retinoblastoma - rare small-cell eye cancer - he 's been battling it for 20 months , had 6 chemotherapy cycles . 
  - in addition to medal sale , almost 500k pln has been raised by polish internauts on regional gofundme site ( siepomaga.pl ), 
   it 's just worth 600 odd . 
  no , it is n't . 
  those medals are worth much more than the cost of their resources - the same way bmw car costs more than price of steel times car mass . 
  population density in central districts is over 7000 people / sq.km - for comparison , other large polish cities ( cracow , gdansk ) hover around 2000 . 
  morning commute is nightmare - in 2015 some streets had average driving speed during morning and afternoon rush of 5-6km / h ( http://korkometr.targeo.pl/warszawa.html ), 
  warsaw is kinda like london or paris - expensive , overcrowded and with superiority complex . 
  great place to make money , but not somewhere you 'd actually want to live in , if given alternative . 
  warsaw actually scores pretty low in `` quality of life '' rankings ( not sure if they even make to top10 ) , compared to other large and mid-sized cities . 
  it 's actually pretty big deal for little lithuania . 
  they got hit very hard by russian embargo ( and even before that , dairy farmers were n't doing that good due to massive overproduction in eu ) and need to find new markers . 
  i 'm only surprised it took them that long - our farmers scrambled for new markers pretty much immediately after embargo hit . 
  nah , first fracking drills were made in 2013 . 
  also , my region is mainly tourism/nature oriented - plenty of lakes and nature 2000 zones - getting a mining permit would be very hard over here - there are huge confirmed iron , titanium and rare earth metals deposits 100 of kilometers to east , but no-one is touching them , since it would wreck the enviorment - august\u00f3w primeval forest is sitting on top of them - you ca n't even mine peat from there , let alone drill kilometers down to get vanadium or titanium ... 
  pretty much all mining activity is concentrated in southernmost regions of country ( silesia region ) . 
  i live in north-eastern poland - palest color on that map . 
  around decade ago ( 2004 ? 
  ) , we had very minor earthquake - shattered flower vases was about the extent of damages . 
  people ended running out to streets in panic , and local newspaper made special issue about it . 
  apparently `` something '' has been going on under kaliningrad that caused earthquake ( 4,5 richter over there ) - plenty of conspiracy theories , but nothing concrete . 
  everytime i see towns in other regions leveled by earthquakes , i find myself grateful for living in such `` boring '' location . 
  yes , one has to pay gift tax ( since you 're creating separate legal entity and `` giving '' assets to it ) - at least if your new trust is us based - there are plenty of legal offshore options ( see : panama papers ) that let you skip it . 
  i 'm sure good accountant/lawyer combo knows some loopholes allowing to bypass it even on us trusts . 
  also , this gift tax is paid only once - afterwards , wealth can be passes between generations tax-free . 
   at least this is my understanding . 
  wrong . 
  irrevocable trust is n't considered taxable estate under us tax code . 
   it seems germany is trying to implement something similar at last . 
  i have yet to see any country successfully pull it off . 
  people will just move assets over to trusts/holding companies . 
  while they do n't sell actual weapons , they offer replicas to any adult . 
  i do n't imagine tsa will be happy after seeing passengers disembarking planes with ak-47 in hand . 
   claiming it would narrow the growing class gap we had some people over here preaching that everyone being equally poor during polish people republic was actually a good thing , as there were no class divides . 
  not sure if that 's example uk should follow tho ... 
  from what i heard , mortgages in us work differently than the ones we have in europe - i do n't know exact details , but for example you ca n't just walk into bank branch and drop off your keys , annulling contract immediately , but foreiting all payments made to date , or the mortgaged house belonging to bank until it 's been paid off ( in europe , house belongs to buyer from day 1 , with mortgages and stuff being listed in separate fields in public ledger - bank ca n't simply foreclose loan and kick people out to street - deliquent loans have to be submitted to court , with bailiff later organizing auction , proceeds from which are being transfered to bank ) . 
  basically , us banks have much more control over property , which allows them to limit potential risks and allows lower profit margins . 
  invasion on polish territory is extremely unlikely - russia has no `` minority '' to protect here , we do n't have any unique resources that they could n't find somewhere on their own territory and from strategic point of view , kaliningrad exclave already provides warm-water port for baltic fleet to station in . 
  any attempt to occupy a portion of polish territory would be met with extreme resistance from both military and civilians . 
  over past decade , patriotism became really `` trendy '' thing to do here - [ streetwear clothes featuring various patriotic emblems ] ( https://www.fightershop.com.pl ) , [ murals on buildings ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=patriotyczny+mural&amp;biw=1666&amp;bih=915&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u ) popping up everywhere . 
  hell , even hip-hop artists who used to write songs like [ `` jp representing '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o07vwkmu8k ) ( jp is acronym for `` fuck the police '' ) nowadays have songs like [ `` uprising '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbwubkywjec ) or [ `` accursed soldiers '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salpkh7ak9u ) ... yea , you get the idea ... on top of all that , our society ( or at least parts of it ) got relatively rich recently , which combined with liberalization of old , communism-era gun laws , made hobbies like shooting much more accessible - you get all kinds of managers and it professionals get together on weekends and play airsoft in forest or shoot guns at ranges . 
  eventually , our ministry of defense got winds of those groups organizing , and want to get them under control , weed out potential undesirables , like neo-nazis etc , and even use them if needed - for example during natural disasters ... 
  overall , it 's just a way to channel youth 's energy into something actually productive ... 
   i say poles should ban all the trains ... well ... we did have `` controversy '' similar to the one here , by usual perpetually offended , whining about `` one way tickets '' being sold by regional railways ... 
  rather than being offended on other 's behalf , writing petty articles from comfort of office with a/c , i invite this `` journalist '' to stand two hours near that entrance during one of numerous heat waves we have every summer . 
  last year we had 38,3 c in shade - those misters were put there for a reason - people were fainting and getting heatstrokes . 
   kind of as appealing as having a 3d printed pizza or burger , it could work but there is no point ... . . 
  i have to disagree . 
  if we were able to create machines that 3d print quality dishes of their users choosing , that would be a game changer , effectively turning entire food industry upside down - eliminates food waste , reduces transportation and processing costs , improves food quality in remote places ( iss , research stations , submarines ) , reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than all our efforts to this day combined , billions of hours saved yearly by households worldwide , and probably 100s reasons more ... 
   if anyone actually knows about this subject more , meaning the link between these countries and the process of radicalization , please share you might want to read up about tatar minority in poland and lithuania - they 've been living here for like 600 years and we never had any problems with them , until few years ago ( it started in 90s , when we got first arab students , but real shit hit the fan in 2010 ) saudis tried to take over - it ended up in literal fistfight between `` old '' and `` new '' imam , since they wanted to import all usual , middle-eastern bullshit , like women wearing burqas , preaching how thieves should have their hands cut off and adulterers get stoned ... you get the idea . 
  germany has huge solar industry , but it 's mostly due to large subsidies they used to get , rather than actual sunlight availability . 
  entire area has between 950-1150 kwh/m2 , with southern lands having the most and decreasing as you go up north . 
  spain for comparison is in 1700-1900 range ( same north/south split applies ) - the same solar panels produce almost the double of electricity when placed in spain , compared to germany . 
  with current technology available and without subsidies , panels in most of germany 's area would n't even cover their production costs ( compared to price of non-renewable energy , like coal ) , but technology is very quickly improving and prices are nosediving , so it looks promising for future . 
  `` city guard '' is the correct term , but anglosphere does n't have similar split of duties . 
  basically , for historical reasons ( magdeburg rights , dating from like 11th century - cities could be granted special status that withdraws their citizens from common land laws and establish their own rights and responsibilities , with every visitor within city walls being subject to them as well ) law enforcement in most cities is divided between police ( which handles felonies and crimes ) and city guard ( which handles various misdemeanors , like jaywalking , parking tickets , public alcohol drinking ... you get the idea ) . 
  for kind of obvious reasons , that `` lesser '' police force is universally despised , and being disbanded in more and more cities , following public referenda . 
   they support the literal opposite of what leftism stands for it 's called [ horseshoe theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) - far-left has more in common with far-right than with mainstream left . 
  some intersectional feminist group in usa recently advocated for separate `` safe spaces '' for people of color in public transport ... 
  i 'm sure they could work out some solution with local klan chapter - the only point of contention i see is whether those designated seats should be located at front or back of buses . 
  just toss them together into a single cell without unchaining . 
  few days later , after having to squeeze into toilet stall together and having to spoonfeed each other , they will get much more cooperative .
