   anyway , i 'm not sure i 'm actually helping things by talking about it , so i 'm going to stop now . 
  but thank you for the conversation , it was enlightening to hear a polish perspective . 
  same here . 
  no offense taken . 
  it was interesting for me to learn that abroad chmielnicki is seen as a pole - for us he 's representative of budding of separate , distinct ukrainian nationality . 
   chmielnicki was polish when it happened , and it 's still remembered as a polish massacre . 
  it 's kind of unfair then , as the whole reason of uprising was that cossacks did n't consider themselves `` poles '' and felt discriminated against by polish nobility ( there were other reasons as well , including personal ( chmielnicki 's land was taken over by wealthy magnate , and when he went complaining , he got ignored , which was initial spark to kill polish garrison of zaporozhan sitch ) , later joined by religious ( orthodoxy vs catholicism ) , class ( peasant uprising against szlachta and jews who worked for them ) reasons , turning into huge clusterfuck , as it usual occurs in such occasions ) : * wherever they found the szlachta , royal officials or jews , they [ cossacks ] killed them all , sparing neither women nor children . 
  they pillaged the estates of the jews and nobles , burned churches and killed their priests , leaving nothing whole . 
  it was a rare individual in those days who had not soaked his hands in blood *  but now that i think about it , there might be survivor bias at work here as well . 
  that 's actually pretty likely explanation . 
  i 'm not saying that everything was all rosy - jews lived in kind of parallel society and accumulated plenty of animosity over the years , since they often worked as moneylenders and landlords . 
  but just like in states there 's huge difference in `` racism '' scale between man who does n't want to employ black person and klansmen stringing up them on trees , saying that poles are responsible , or even supported holocaust is huge insult and lie . 
   the chmielnitzky massacres were the worst in jewish history before wwii chmielnitzky was an ukrainian cossack leader during [ uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising#jews ) and they were n't discriminating when it came to killing both poles and polish jews . 
  it was n't actual polish ( commonwealth ) army that did the killings , but the opposite , separatist side . 
   many poles cooperated with the nazis during the war . 
  the percentage of population that helped nazis was way lower than in other german-occupied areas ( [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii#poland ) ) , and giving jews away was automatic death sentence by underground army . 
  largest percentage of `` righteous '' of yad vashem are poles . 
  ( [ 2 ] ( http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/statistics.asp ) ), 
  it 's not a `` pharmacy '' , but a `` st. stephan publishing house '' ( http://sklep.stanislawbm.pl/pl/p/consolatyna.-zestaw-antydepresyjny-po-utracie-dziecka/1607 ) - they sell various religious books , and catholic paraphernalia ( church decorations , banners etc. ) . 
  since they use `` drug '' in product description and have drug-like packaging , someone reported them to pharmacy governing body ( gif - basically polish fda ) , and they are suing them for misleading advertisement and sale of `` drug '' which has no proven medical benefit ( `` drug '' is kind of protected word over here - only substances that passed tests can be labeled as such ) . 
  we did n't :( poland really wanted it , but our politicians ended up rejecting the offer after `` advice '' from our `` ally '' . 
  we do n't know how jesus looked like either - current image we have was popularized by italian classical painters , and is distinctly european-looking , for someone who was born in middle east . 
   curious how similar that is to finnish . 
  well , it 's not like animals have different sounds , varied by country ... 
  most of the time , it 's simply transliteration of the sound using nation 's alphabet - whether dog goes `` au '' , `` ha\u0142 '' or `` hau '' can be debatable , depending on country , but it 's still the same sound . 
  of course it will be similar . 
  we have separate sounds for every bird - house sparrow goes '' \u0107wir \u0107wir '' , stork goes `` kle kle '' , raven has `` kra kra '' , pidgeons sound has it 's own name - `` gruchanie '' - no idea how to transliterate it into english . 
  that 's what you get when you have vlad the impaler as national hero ... 
  did n't some ngo set up their own `` ttip reading room '' in a tent in front of ep building , once the documents got leaked ? 
  i recall reading some news that they got quickly removed from premises by police ... 
  not really . 
  go to any `` eco '' , `` organic '' , `` fair trade '' grocery store and check how much a bunch of carrots costs - hipsters and health-oriented folks pay top dollar for this kind of stuff . 
  i remember reading an article about `` fake amish '' farmers peddling their wares on local markets in usa ... 
   i do n't want and have to pay for anyways as it 's included in the price . 
  if it makes you feel any better , those tiny cams cost well under a dollar at wholesale china retailers . 
  it does n't affect the price much . 
   like , how far does tor 's security go ? 
  beyond the provider ? 
  it 's a project funded by us military - the gist of it was to give citizens living under oppressive regimes tools ( bypass censorship and organize ) to topple dictators themselves and/or to interact with foreigners/democracy before democracy comes to them - think of it as 21st century project similar to cold war radio free europe . 
  that being said , it 's explicitly designed to protect from eavesdropping from state-level actors - your provider knowing about your kinks might be embarrassing , but for some whistle-blower/opposition it 's literally difference between life and death/work camp . 
  abortion in usa is legal on federal level , thanks to roe v. wade supreme court ruling . 
  however , some conservative states enact additional laws , creating extra `` hoops '' that you have to jump thru - for example mandatory waiting periods - you need to wait 24 + hours before initial decision and actual performing of procedure to `` make sure you 're decided '' , mandatory usg examination , which includes showing images of fetus you 're about to kill and/or ktg with beating hearth on loudspeakers , mandatory counseling which includes presenting `` alternatives '' like adoption , ( for mothers younger than 21 ) notification of one 's parents or even requiring their consent in first place . 
  there are also other laws , targeting abortion providers , making it very difficult to operate abortion clinic , like strict personel requirements ( requiring surgeon and anesthesiologist present , even for simple `` pill '' abortions ) , certifications , even fire safety rules , which means clinics are expensive to open and you often have to drive 100s of miles to nearest one . 
   so it 's the same old romanian-roma confusion . 
  that 's sad . 
  yea . 
  at least it 's gradually improving - the same cbos poll has been going since 1993 - romanians started at 65 % dislike in first one , dead last place . 
  drivers are selling tickets in poland , in case you forgot / did n't have time to buy it in kiosk , and while it 's being gradually phased out , in favor of ticket machines at stops and inside buses , i 've never heard about a single case of bus driver being robbed here . 
   expect 3 years minimun , but you can quote me in that it will be exteneded at least another 2 years if the uk is willing to negotiate it 's other way around - 2 years minimum , with possible `` transitional '' agreement of up to 3 years . 
  iceland also grows bananas in greenhouses ... just because someone does something , it does n't mean it 's feasible on large scale . 
  of course - i 'm pretty sure our local production would be enough for non-energy usage . 
  i was just answering to user asking what we need the gas for in first place . 
  without gas you 'd starve - it 's essential component of modern fertilizers . 
  current agriculture production would be unsustainable without them . 
  there are also other users , and we will keep using it long after we switch to 100 % renewable energy production . 
   one of the things i know about ukraine is the great borscht debate . 
  is it ukrainian ? 
  is it russian ? 
  is it a universal slavic invention ? 
  at least in poland , there 's borscht and ukrainian borscht - while the former is seen as universal slavic , ukrainian variant is different due to addition of cut cabbage and beans . 
  for latest , cutting-edge treatments , experimental drugs etc. 
  you 're better off staying in usa . 
  for any routine , well-estabilished procedures , europe will be orders of magnitude cheaper , even if you opt for private route ( waiting lists for state-funded healthcare are an issue in poland , but if you 're willing to put money on table , everything can be arranged almost immediately ) . 
  any large hospital in central and western europe has identical standard to the ones you can find in usa . 
  but ... did you have your minister of environment made a [ official inquiry regarding chemtrails ] ( http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm7.nsf/interpelacjatresc.xsp?key=53ac31db ) yet ? 
  get on our level . 
   one has to also consider what is an `` acceptable '' amount of fatalities . 
  eu has plan to eliminate fatalities completely by 2050 [ ( source ) ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_5.6.5.html ) . 
  yes , i laughed at idea when it got announced too . 
  given advances in engineering ( check out videos comparing crash tests results of european and chinese cars ) and driverless cars on the horizon , it might actually be doable . 
   hope there will be a mega-thread and live coverage . 
  after sanctions on russia got announced , there was popular site making rounds on runet - zenrus.ru showing realtime price of usd/rub eur/rub and ural oil commodity prices , complete with soothing music and artsy background , so that people can watch their wealth dissapear in real-time . 
  i hope someone cooks up something similar for usd/gbp . 
  that 's where party affiliation comes into play . 
  seats are divided by number of votes on party . 
  then first x persons from that party list get the seat . 
  however , you can `` override '' that numbering , if one of candidates from list gets more votes than people above him in queue . 
  only ~ 60 % . 
  jealous much that our immigrants are actually working , instead of sitting on welfare and causing trouble ? 
  also , it 's not only `` shit jobs '' where ukrainians find employment - quite a few found work in it ( we have chronic shortage of those , as our growth outpaced supply of graduates ) and as skilled tradesmen . 
  tens of thousands are studying at our universities , with roughly third ( ~ 36 % ) declaring that they 'd like to stay in poland permanently . 
   do not want to give anything to southern europe [ poland signs 250m eur guarantee for greek debts ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/premier-polska-udzieli-grecji-gwarancji-na-250-mln-eur-2360098.html ) ( mind you , we 're not as rich as western countries , and opposition pretty much called for pm head on pike for that - they said it 's sunk money and we should fund nurses wages instead . 
  yet , we went ahead with it anyway , since it was the right thing to do ) . 
  put them in jails ? 
   an economic union does n't mean that money will be paid to eastern european countries . 
  so we just cut all funding for that and everyone deals with refugees on their own , including germany that just blocks them from entering at it 's borders . 
  eastern europe would lose all funding and be on it 's own regarding refugees , a useful deal for germany tbh . 
  sounds like a good idea ? 
  oooor we just deal with it together and with solidarity and some countries in the east behave less like spoiled little children . 
  how much do you think french supermarket operating in poland transfer back home in `` licensing/brand fees '' ? 
  how many photovoltaic panels or wind turbines would german companies sell here if we removed anti-dumping tariffs from chinese-made ones ? 
  in january only , we bought 42 thousands new cars , mostly german-made - i 'm sure trump would love if we put up tarrifs on them and invited american carmakers instead . 
  those few bilions you 're sending to us are a tiny fraction of what your industries are earning on our market - this is two-way relationship that we 're both profiting from , so stop pretending that you bought us for those pennies - there are larger players that will more than happily step up if you try to blackmail us to fix the mess you started yourselves . 
  do n't you know that only brown people count ? 
  or ... you know ... learned about it in school ? 
  i do n't know about denmark , but in poland it 's part of [ middle school history curriculum ] ( http://gkonskowola.net.pl/dokumenty/historia.pdf ) . 
  and what prevents them from throwing out their papers again and getting new identity ? 
  should western made goods be sold in east at local prices , below costs too , or does that `` equality '' only should go one way ? 
  since taking fingerprints is racist , all they have to do is come up with new name and place of birth . 
  as you can see from graph , it 's also very `` shaky '' - there 's huge number of windmills on coast , and since you ca n't simply shut down coal plants with a flick of switch ( it takes 24-48 hours to put flames out or back on in our plants , germans are probably similar ) , everytime there 's stronger wind , it also de-stabilizes electricity grid in western poland as well ( since our grids are connected , while bavarians keep blocking new links in their region because of `` muh landscape '' ) .
