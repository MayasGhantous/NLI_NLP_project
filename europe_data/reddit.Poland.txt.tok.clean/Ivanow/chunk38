  last year it got so bad that that it caused blackouts in some regions - on 15th september 2016 we had [ surge of 6237mw , which could cause cascading failure in entire central europe ( germany , austria , poland , czech republic , slovakia and hungary ) ] ( http://wysokienapiecie.pl/sieci/1252-sytuacja-na-granicy-polski-i-niemiec-grozi-europejskim-blackoutem ) . 
  we need improved energy storage technology and we need it now . 
   there are clear visa refusal rate thresholds defined , and those countries do n't meet them . 
  you know how black people in usa are stopped more often for `` random checks '' , which results in more convictions ( assuming percentage of people having for example drugs on them being the same between white and black population ) , which , in turn , results in even more `` random checks '' , and so on ... 
  it 's quite similar situation - you can be denied entry simply because border agent does n't like the way you smile ( there are no clear criteria after meeting which , you are guaranteed entry - it all depends on official 's mood ) , which in turn increases your country 's refusal rate , which places your fellow citizens under even more scrutiny , which increases refusal rate ... 
  it was n't eu that ran a campaign of kicking all foreigners out as one of main points of referendum . 
  most people on the continent have absolutely no problems with letting brit pensioners stay where they are . 
  there are some details that need to be ironed out , like healthcare coverage , but it 's easily solvable once proper negotiations begin . 
  it might be different in other countries , but in poland one blogger did a test yesterday ( http://wulkanista.pl/kto-zaplaci-nizsza-skladke-oc/ ) , and it appears that time left on your insurance ( personal liability insurance in mandatory here ) does affect quote you 're getting from companies - even when all other parameters were the same , policy starting on same day being quoted 54 % ( sic ! ), 
  more than baseline number , policy from next day being 36 % extra , with each day more to spare lowering it by few percentage points with lowest quote for 14 and more days left on current policy . 
  the fact that those issues are so far away is exactly the reason the talks should begin now . 
  you do n't go look around for your car insurance on last day before previous one ends , unless you want to get fucked over . 
  having plenty of time and being able to conduct negotiation without pressure is the best way to ensure both sides complete talks satisfied with outcome , without one having undue power over another . 
  it 's not only politicians - private citizens have it very easy too - we have special , government-ran websites ( like www.funduszeeuropejskie.gov.pl - i recall even seeing ads for it on national tv some time ago ) with search-able database of eu projects that offer funding , making it very easy to check out if your project qualifies , what are it 's requirements , whom to contact regarding it , sample of documents and how to fill forms and so on ... 
  there are also a plenty of private companies ( long live the capitalism ! ), 
  who offer consultancies and can do this stuff `` a to z '' for you at relatively little cost . 
  portugal - the westernmost eastern european country . 
   i was under impression they were a force behind decommunization of poland , and that this act is generally considered . 
  am i wrong about these things ? 
  it 's basically a conspiracy theory , popular in some circles . 
  the gist of it , is that communist government and secret services knew that fall of regime is coming , so rather than end up hanging from lamp posts in warsaw , or other similar ends ( see : ceau\u015fescu trial and execution in romania ) , they decided to pass the leadership in `` controlled fashion '' - planting agents in budding `` solidarity '' worker 's rights movement and direct changes so that they retain power ( from the shadows ) or at least money , estabilish `` independent media '' financed and ran by former secret police agents , sell newly-privatized infrastructure and companies to `` their '' people and so on ... 
  great . 
  now try to translate it into english  6000 pln comment is more relatable , so i used that one as an example . 
  of course . 
  i 'm not talking about absolute numbers , but rather `` perception '' - a few relatively big ones hit them one after another during election year , which shaped narrative . 
  pretty much the same mechanisms that got us brexit and trump . 
  previous ruling party ( po ) got mired in scandals and became detached from their voter base ( leaked recordings of private conversations showing contempt for working class - for example former minister of infrastructure saying `` only idiots work for less than 6000 pln/month '' ) . 
  meanwhile , pis promised to `` make poland great again '' by taxing multinational corporations , patriotism and respect for veterans and huge social programs , hid all `` crazies '' in closet for duration of campaign ( everytime press found macierewicz and managed to get him on record saying something , pis ratings fell 2-3 % ) , promised tough stance on migrants/refugees and had very good campaign strategy ( they managed to convince a lot of young voters , who traditionally voted po - the same voters who joked in previous elections `` hide your grandmas ' id card on election day so she wo n't be able to vote pis '' ) , while rest of opposition completely lacked any strategy and got destroyed by infighting and lack of vision ... 
   so much so that the proposal omitted podkowa le\u015bna which is smack in the middle of the suggested new boundary ( displayed in green ) , coincidentally the only district that did n't vote for pis in the last elections . 
  at least we got some pretty good memes out of that one ... 
  personally , i liked the one parodying asterix & obelix opening sentences ( * `` all of it ? 
  there 's one little village holding out ... '' * ) the most ... 
  you have no idea . 
  what pis is doing is child 's play compared to some voting districts in us ... may i present you , [ illinois 's 4th congressional district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:illinois_district_4_2004.png ) ( yes , all this green area is a single district ), 
  thatsthejoke.jpg most of the times , someone saying `` i hate drama '' is a major source of drama herself . 
  avocados do n't grow in europe , you ignorant . 
  we import them all from central america and indonesia . 
  what about taxes ? 
  ca n't you guys simply go full al capone on their asses ? 
  even if they can no longer be charged on corruption and theft , they could easily be slapped with tax evasion , money laundering and so on ... 
  in poland you can get up to 10 years for violent gang leadership - exactly the same 10 years is also maximum sentence for money laundering . 
  also , 75 % tax bracket for `` udocumented income '' . 
  the same spots they were during previous exchanges . 
  mexico between ireland and spain , canada on north sea , between iceland and norway , and australia separating ukraine and russia ( bit controversial , since / r/russia was really buthurt over stealing their clay last time - maybe we can try squishing it between greece and italy ? ), 
  that 's one of most retarded arguments i see being parroted . 
  those `` imported foreigners '' need to eat something , live somewhere , buy furniture , electronics , cars and 100s of other stuff , creating jobs in that process . 
  in august 2014 we had unemployment of 11 % , two years later , after `` importing '' almost 1 million ukrainians , our unemployment in august 2016 was at 6 % . 
  any migrant working honest job is a benefit to economy . 
   40 % unemployment holy shit . 
  those regions are relatively sparsely populated . 
  also , many people living near the border were `` officially '' unemployed ( to get health insurance and social service benefits ) , while in practice they were simply smuggling cigaretes/gasoline over the border . 
   unemployment is still bad . 
  no , it is n't . 
  ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:unemployment_rates,_seasonally_adjusted,_november_2016_ ( % 25 ) _ f2.png ) 6 % is one of better rates in europe . 
  uk for comparison has unemployment rate of 4.8 % . 
  do n't worry , wages rise will follow . 
  we were in exactly the same situation ( https://i.redd.it/eiqontbviu8y.jpg ) - decade later , companies are fighting each other for employees and average wage doubled . 
  [ switzerland air force works only during office hours ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2014/feb/19/swiss-air-force-ethiopian-airlines-hijacking-office-hours ) ( 8am - 5pm , with 1,5 hour lunch break at noon ) , and i 'm not joking here . 
  hopefuly , they plan to change to 24/7 coverage starting in 2020 . 
  silesia would be problematic . 
  i do n't want to partake in another fyrom/macedonia dispute . 
  yup , they passed it as official translation some time ago . 
  there have been some threads about it on / r/europe recently , including picture of updated google maps showing new translation . 
  200 pln is n't popular simply because most of monetary supply is made with 100pln notes ( [ chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/afismph.png ) ) , which serve similar purpose ( store of relatively large value ) - if we reduced number of 100pln notes in circulation , shifting some towards 200pln , you 'd see them much more often . 
  on mine it 's on page 6 . 
   our airforce only uses airplanes with propellers , so you know we 're a force to be reckoned with . 
   tbh , there 's nothing wrong with using propeller transport planes for bulky stuff - jets have lower range and efficency ( both fuel/km and fuel/kg ) - even usa uses mostly propeller crafts , like airbus a400m atlas and alenia c-27j spartan . 
   if a war breaks out most of ee is expected to be occupied and slowly taken back . 
  well ... at least it 's some improvement . 
  during cold war we were expected to be turned into nuclear wasteland to halt soviet tank divisions ' advance . 
   i found a british article somewhere discussing just that . 
  he something like , ` we ca n't get most of our parts somewhere else because they 're only made in germany and they can only be made in germany ' it highlights a whole new angle . 
   the european economy has become so integrated that just looking at import and export figures is totally useless . 
  i saw it happen once already . 
  in ussr every republic had their `` specializations '' - belarus made fridges , ukraine made planes and rockets ... you get the idea . 
  now , the networks were so intertwined , that ukraine 's jets required communication systems produced in latvia , which latvia made using russian designs out of resources mined in kazakhstan ... and so on . 
  once those links got shattered in 90s , it lead to massive clusterfuck with huge factories being unable to both source their materials and find buyers for ready-made products . 
  it took over a decade to sort everything out , with many industries collapsing in meantime , often bought out for pennies on the dollar by western companies . 
  of course . 
  i 'm just showing that eu can be flexible - the question is how important will uk see this matter , compared to thousand others , and whether they will want to devote portion of their two-year period to negotiate it , or will they focus only on london issues ( passporting rights etc. ), 
  and leave northern ireland to dry . 
  it 's definitely doable - we had similar issue after joining ue , which cut existing links to russia and belarus and made much more difficult for them to get visas . 
  eu agreed to special exemption for citizens of bordering regions on both sides , called `` small border traffic '' . 
  portuguese ( jeronimo martins ) own largest supermarket chain in poland ( biedronka , around 3000 stores ) and they are 7th largest taxpayer here - they paid almost 1 billion pln ( ~ 250m eur ) last year . 
  few years ago , one polish company ( lpp - clothing brands reserved , cropp , house and few others ) moved their tax residence to cyprus and uae - customers raised hell and widespread boycotts started . 
  they backed down soon after . 
   which polish vodka do you like ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017bubr\u00f3wka is great if you like flavored ones , or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soplica_ ( vodka ) ( noble variant ) if you 're looking for `` clear '' one . 
  every car was a luxury during the communist era . 
  waiting list for [ fiat 126p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_126 ) was 3-5 years long . 
   but you ca n't deduce who is their most fed soldier , or how they feed their soldiers off of 1 picture . 
  [ can we deduce it from lowering requirements across the board then ?

  poland : starting with 4th grade , you pick first foreign language - usually it 's english , but some people pick german , russian , or ( very rarely ) french , spanish or even more `` exotic '' ones ( i think i read about some class that had mandarin ) . 
  in high school you pick your second language . 
  being able to communicate depends mostly on age - pretty much everyone under 30 years old knows at least basic english , while older population learned russian . 
  or , alternatively , we can switch to electric cars with power generated from renewable sources , which seems like current intended solution . 
  yup . 
  one important fragment was completed literally days before visitors arrived - we had to get some huge-ass machine from czech republic that laid entire lane at once , after original chinese contractor fucked up big time , and there were memos when entering it to make sure you have enough gas for next xx km , since no gas stations along the road are built yet . 
  yes .
