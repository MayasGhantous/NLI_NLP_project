  we 've been using renewables for relatively long time , and only in recent years , countries like china or india are catching up . 
  many countries have guaranteed tarrifs for green power plant owners and there are eu funds that you can apply to partially subsidize the costs - effectively turning such operation into free money for it 's owner . 
  generally , in most countries , wind was the most popular source - we get way less sunshine than india , as we 're further north - only places with significant photowoltaic share are spain ( they have the most sun out of entire europe ) and germany - this is changing rapidly , as panels become much cheaper . 
  there are wind turbines all over the coast in north . 
   to the people of ireland , i love iceland , could you tell me ireland and iceland are two different countries . 
  there 's not much going on in iceland it-wise , so i assume you 're asking about ireland . 
  it depends . 
  for skyscrapers , there 's really not much wiggle-room , and overall trend is to have them `` modern '' / `` futuristic '' look , sometimes with some kind of twist . 
  low-rise architecture is much more interesting - we have laws protecting old buildings , so you ca n't simply tear them down to build generic steel & glass tower # 5253 , and all renovation works require input from historians and renovated buildings should look as close to original as possible ( this is also the reason you can sometimes buy old estates and castles for $ 1 - renovating them up to the specification costs millions ) . 
  also , building permits often have stipulations regarding type of building you can build - i own a plot of land on countryside , and if i were to build new house there , it 'd have to have specific design ( design likened or inspired by traditional architecture of region , roof angle of 30-45 degrees , roof tiles color out of pre-aproved list and so on ... ), 
  all tests are graded 0-100 points ( they are graded by teachers from different city and anonymized , to prevent bias ) . 
  now , let 's use an example - if you were to apply for `` chemistry '' masters course at university of gdansk , the formula is as follow ( every university announces it 's own beforehand , so you know which subjects to pick on exam , depending on where/what you want to study ) : `` chemistry '' exam score * 0,45 or `` chemistry ( extended ) '' exam score * 0,675 `` math '' exam score * 0,2 or `` math ( extended ) '' exam score * 0,3 `` foreign language '' exam score * 0.15 or `` foreign language ( extended ) '' exam score * 0,225 `` chosen subject ( one of : biology , physics or geography ) '' exam score * 0,2 or `` chosen subject ( one of : biology , physics or geography ) - extended '' exam score * 0,3 now sum all four and you have your total score for that recruitment . 
   how do you avoid the poisonous ones ? 
  education . 
  most important rule is to discard any shroom that you have even tiniest doubt about , do n't pick very young ones , since they are harder to spot the difference . 
  there are also atlas books with pictures and annotations , helping beginners to recognize species , and some places offer free service that you can bring the mushrooms you picked to them to verify that all are safe to eat . 
   do people ever fuck up and die/need hospitalisation ? 
  yes , we get over 100 cases every year , but the number is dropping ( it was over 500 two decades ago ) . 
  luckily , odds are kind of in our favor - we have over three thousand shroom species , 200 of which are poisonous and only a few are deadly . 
  most common mix-up is [ amanita phalloides ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amanita_phalloides ) ( death cap ... ) with [ russula aeruginea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russula_aeruginea ) . 
  poland : classes finishing high school have month-long country-wide exam period in may . 
  every day is dedicated to one subject - you need to take exam from polish , math , one foreign language and one extra subject ( geography , physics , second language ... ) . 
  those are minimum requirements - you need to pass all of them . 
  in addition to that , you can take additional tests from more subjects , as well as have `` extended '' level , with more difficult questions . 
  every university course has certain requirements - for example , if you want to apply to it , you need to take math ( extended ) , physics or geography and english , while law degree might ask for polish , history and civic society . 
  every university has different criteria , they can also award additional points for extra school activities/volounteering/sport achievments and so on . 
  at the end of recruitment period they sort list of all candidates that applied to them by number of points they got and admit top results . 
  no , not the hallucinogenic kind . 
  we use many species of forest mushrooms in our dishes , walking around picking them is also very relaxing outdoor activity and popular pastime . 
   do peoples own many guns in europe and do you like hunting much ? 
  which animals are commonly hunted ? 
  it 's relatively niche sport , popular in some circles ( mostly high-income lawyers , politicians etc. 
  guns and ammo are bloody expensive here ) . 
  in poland it 's foxes , boars and deers . 
   does family have any say in wedding contract ? 
  does girls look at the riches , status and clan of boy before agreeing wedding ? 
  or they do n't care ? 
  does many girls work in high paying jobs ? 
  we no longer have a concept of `` weeding contract '' as in some kind of business transaction ( dowry etc. ) . 
  most marriages are made out of love , and while parents sometimes might be unhappy that their precious daughter/son 's spouse is uneducated , born in countryside and so on , it 's ultimately newlywed 's decision that matters . 
  we also do n't have `` clans '' - families are much smaller , with fewer children . 
  as for family role , it 's a bit of split - in southern and eastern europe , family ties are much more important , with children living in parents for relatively long time , until they `` estabilish themselves '' comfortably , buy own house , get good job , while in north and western europe , those ties are much looser - kids often move out as soon as they turn 18 . 
  it 's basically series of three polls , asking french `` who contributed the most to defeating nazis ? '', 
  conducted in 1945 , 1994 , 2004 . 
  you can see how perception of the same events changed over the years . 
  this is a big issue for russia , who believes that western propaganda downplays their sacrifice ( and as much as i hate ussr , looking at graphs like that , one ca n't disagree ), 
   which country you 're from and how do you feel about the refugee crisis ? 
  poland . 
  short answer : embarrassing clusterfuck . 
  long answer : there are so many things wrong with current situation that i do n't even know where to begin . 
  processing asylum requests of opportunistic economic migrants who made their way to europe , rather than truly vulnerable families , stuck in camps in jordan or syria is biggest issue , and kind of root of the problem . 
  any arrivals should be ferried back to those camps ( which should receive increased funding ) , with processing cost of that ferry being billed to country the boat originally departed from . 
  any countries refusing to cooperate , by providing documentation or refusing to accept denied asylum seekers should have all eu foreign aid funds withdrawn ( that money could go towards funding our border service and fund refugee camps in syria/jordan/turkey ) and/or be subject of economic embargo . 
  asylum requests should be consulted with our intelligence services to weed out potential isis sleeper cells and war criminals , contain fingerprints ( no , trying to prevent one person from having fourteen different identities and protect citizens and other refugees is not racist ) , and ideally include as much documentation as possible ( `` refugees '' from morocco trowing out their passports and claiming to be syrian is outrageous ) - however , i understand that with all bombs and shit flying out over there , keeping hold of documentation might be difficult , so some kind of `` vouch '' system , where local , already granted refugee status , communities , could take some paperless person they might know or coming from the same area as them , in exchange to being `` responsible '' for them , might be desirable ( i 'm not lawyer however , and this idea might be both illegal and corruption-inducing ) . 
  asylum request should be processed on eu level , with accepted ones being assigned to one of member states ; refugee accepted and assigned to poland , portugal or bulgaria who moves to germany or sweden should have their status immediately withdrawn and flown back within 24 hours to country of their citizenship and have all their possible asylum requests automatically denied . 
  countries in eastern europe should increase their refugee capacity , relocating some of those residing in west and south currently - we have plenty of old former - [ kolhoz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kolkhoz ) buildings and flats on countryside that are rotting away , which could be renovated cheaply and house tens thousands of people ( it wo n't be as rich as flat in hamburg , paid by german taxpayer , but it 's definitely safe , which genuine refugees will appreciate ) . 
  also , did you know that india used to host refugees from poland during ww2 ? 
  digvijaysinhji ranjitsinhji has a square in warsaw ( our capital city ) and monument named after him ( we use `` good maharaja '' title however , since his name is literally unpronounceable for us ) , is named-patron of prestigious school and we dedicated fund for refugee schooling in his name . 
   which country has the best food in your opinion and which has the worst ? 
  i understand this is subjective . 
  so , please do n't start a fire . 
  i 'd say that it 's combination of different european countries cousines that makes it so great . 
  personally , i love italian pastas , slavic potato dishes and soups and mediterranean salads . 
   name a movie i should watch from your country and name a book from your country that i should read . 
  it might vary , depending on your tastes . 
  [ teddy bear ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teddy_bear_\\ ( 1980_film \\ ) ) showing some absurdity of communist poland ( some humor might be lost to non-european viewer however ) , [ pigs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigs_\\ ( 1992_film \\ ) ) an action-movie with political twist , or [ with fire and sword ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/with_fire_and_sword_\\ ( film \\ ) ) a historical love drama set during commonwealth ( polish-lithuanian , not the british one ) times and ukrainian cossacks uprising . 
  what 's so strange ? 
  [ he used to be such tourist ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lveejq2.jpg ) , now he 's the one meeting tourists . 
  circle of life . 
  we had -25 as well . 
  moisture in air is rising , since new front is coming from ocean side , and current -15 feels worse than weekend -25 . 
   a hairdressing school 230 meters down the road was the proximate cause for mellow yellow blazing out ; a new rule states that they must be at least 250 meters apart . 
  our shop owners have similar issue with proximity to school laws when getting alcohol selling license . 
  they end up making mini-labirynths in front of store , similar to those in queues before baggage dropoff/security checkpoints at airport , to extend `` walking distance '' . 
  it brings whole new set of problems - just like in spain ( and in poland decade ago ) , you have employers offering shitty terms , saying `` do n't like it ? 
  i have 30 prospective hires for your place '' , cities with such low unemployment have employees with that attitude - `` i want a raise , or i 'm leaving on monday '' , companies have problems expanding due to lack of workers , poaching talent from competition is huge issue , and some sectors ( like it ) got so competitive that we have companies giving out literally crates of beer for free to students leaving their cv at desk on festivals . 
   usually very `` patriotic '' that 's relatively new addition . 
  it was all about `` fuck the police '' just a few years ago . 
  that 's really cute . 
  looks like they misunderstood / u/flick1981 comment - they wrote that he mixed up russia and belarus , while he simply said that he would like russia to have similar visa-free regime as belarus just introduced . 
  happy to see that situation is improving . 
   that 's funny but some of them are located just in malls that 's one of recent `` trends '' over here - government is opening up places in popular spots , like shopping malls etc , in order to be `` closer to people '' . 
  you can [ get driver 's license , declare property taxes , change place of residence etc. 
  ( link is to one of such points in my hometown ), 
   do you think we can solve just one problem at a time ? 
  i wish that was n't the case . 
  sadly , previous experiences with various parties we had since 89 left me a bit jaded . 
  frankly , if you manage to pull off 20 % of stuff from that list , i 'd consider it a success , despite not agreeing with your programme in some points . 
   also , if millions going to the church ( by direct donations from budget or tax exempts ) and very strong influence over created laws are non-issues to you , you 're clearly a close minded person . 
  do you have any idea how much money our state spends on paper , printing and staples ? 
  but i have yet to see any party make a major point about it , and seek savings there , by moving as much documentation as possible to paper-less form . 
  yet , where it comes to wealth transfers to church , which are arguably tiny for country as large as ours , every party ( both left and right-wing ) seems it as absolutely mandatory to take position , some even making it a major selling point ( i 'd like to remind you that this entire comment chain came from someone asking how exactly your program differs from pis , and you consider it a big issue ) . 
  i 'm not happy with influence church has over our laws , but i do n't consider it a priority - i care the most about economy , and all other issues can take a back seat - once we have no kid going hungry to school , people are free to start and run business easily , and employees can work liveable wage , without having to worry whether they will still have job next week , then we can come back to discussion about church influence on our politics . 
   relationship with church is a big one for many . 
  also , in grand scheme of things , extremely unimportant - it 's palikot all over again , arguing whether there should be crucifix hanged above parliament doors , while people work on `` junk contracts '' and mothers have problem finding kindergarten spot for their kids . 
  what percentage of state budget is currently being transfered to church under current , catholic-fundamentalist , pis 's rule ? 
   but applying for a polish visa can be a tricky business sometimes . 
  do n't blame us . 
  we issue 500k visas to belarus every year ( [ source ] ( http://kresy24.pl/bialorusini-dostaja-najwiecej-wiz-schengen/ ) ) with 99,2 % approval rate , and we wanted to increase capacity , by opening new local consulates , but belarusian goverment does n't give us permission to do so ( [ source ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/75/921/artykul/859313,ambasador-wiz-byloby-wiecej-ale-bialorus-nie-pozwala-zwiekszyc-liczby-konsulow ) ) . 
  also , in 2010 we signed and ratified '' [ small border traffic ] ( https://www.msz.gov.pl/pl/informacje_konsularne/maly_ruch_graniczny/ ) '' agreement , similar to one we have with kaliningrad , where citizens of bordering town could pass border both ways with no visa requirements - to this day belarusian side did n't ratify it , citing `` technical difficulties '' ( [ source ] ( http://www.dziennikwschodni.pl/biala-podlaska/umowa-o-malym-ruchu-granicznym-z-bialorusia-jest-od-dawna-wciaz-nie-zostal-uruchomiony,n,1000178001.html ) ) .
