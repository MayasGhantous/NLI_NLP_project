  since whole article is in english , it 's only fitting that they used english translation of org name , adding msf in parentheses to make francophone purists happy . 
  it 's very important that you should n't treat this assault as politically-motivated . 
  nowa huta is very nasty district - closest thing you can get to `` ghetto '' in poland , housing low-income families , with abudance of `` dresy '' ( `` chavs '' / `` gopniks '' ) looking for any excuse to fight - waving foreign flag is just as good excuse as `` staring '' or not having a cigarette . 
  it 's getting more peaceful in recent years , due to gentrification , but it 's still the place where most muggings occur in krakow . 
  `` huta '' in polish means `` ironworks '' , so full district name is `` new ironworks '' , created from scratch by communists to serve as housing base for ( newly-built ) steel mill `` lenin '' in 50s . 
  to be honest , lithuania and ukraine are n't the only countries upset by some of proposed graphics ... 
  there was quite a lot of butthurt in poland itself over some other proposals for passport graphics , like `` barrow of barrows '' ( 111 metres high monument of sorts , containing soil from thousands of places connected to places poles fought for independence , were victim of genocide and so on ... ) - people were n't happy about symbol of `` perpetual victimhood '' being one of proposals , preferring to opt for something happy or triumphal instead ... 
  yes , we 're still net contributor as a whole , but that gap is closing quite fast ( net -9.5 bn eur in 2015 compared to -13.7 bn in 2014 or -12.2 bn in 2013 ) . 
   i do n't think individual provinces can be reliably split out like that , but maybe its something about how poland specifically allocates it . 
  structural funds are allocated on region , not country-level . 
  poland has 16 voivodeships . 
  as of now , 2 out of 16 are ineligible for them ( mazowieckie and lower silesia ) , due to no longer being below criteria ( less than 75 % of eu average gdp per capita , and two more ( greater poland and silesia ) are getting close , especially with uk leaving , bringing average down . 
  russia wo n't work for purposes pis needs it to . 
  poles mostly see it as kind of failed state with ambitions to playing big game but not enough resources to follow through . 
  they have strong military , but people are confident that nato , and especially usa , would protect us , so if you get news articles about russia placing nuclear-capable iskanders in kaliningrad or jets intercepted over baltic , people only go `` yawn ... '' . 
  energy dependency is much more serious , but it 's pretty abstract subject that average voter has trouble comprehending . 
   the skateboarding priest is magnificent too . 
  tbh , calling it `` newspaper '' is really stretching it - it 's a tabloid like german `` bild '' , uk `` daily mail '' or polish `` fakt '' ... 
  really gives a perspective on how much of a shitshow our current government is , is n't it ? 
  overall , poles are one of most pro-eu citizens . 
  we have some criticisms regarding certain eu processes but overall , the image is very positive . 
  pis really toned down their rhetoric during elections ( for example , macierewicz , our conspiracy-theorist-in-chief , also - current defence minister , was nowhere to be seen , to the point of press joking that he got stashed somewhere in the closet ) , which allowed them to grab many votes from centre , from compromised po , and ultimately won them election . 
  crazy stuff only started later on ... 
   in the realm of international politics , this , to me , indicates , that pis is actually really wanting to have that confrontation with us . 
  i still do n't understand why ... wait , i do n't understand , why they 're doing it this way . 
  pis came out really battered from recent confrontations and spent a lot of political capital on abortion laws , enviorment protection ( primeval forest situation gets reposted on here pretty much every day , but there are other bills , with local reach ) , nepotism ( misiewicz is pretty much a symbol/meme in polish internet ) , media takeover ( public tv ratings are nosediving ) , and most recent power grab of judiciary that got ultimately vetoed by their own president , followed by smaller coalition members declaring aganist it - tides are turning , party is splintering , and pis needs external enemy to unite aganist - showdown with eu would be a perfect opportunity . 
  of course . 
  this is message to pis `` die hard '' electorate , the kind of people who think russia and germany spend 100 % of time plotting downfall of glorious poland , never been outside of country , refuse to shop in `` non-polish '' shops and so on ... everyone else , as / u/mysterious _ manny pointed above , just cringes . 
  dragging up nazis everytime like that is mostly seen as polish-german version of [ `` and you are lynching negroes '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ), 
   so , why the hell did that polish tv station feel compelled to accuse us germans today of voting for hitler ? 
  how does that make any sense at all ? 
  i just saw the video and i 'm still baffled . 
  we did n't vote for hitler , ffs . 
  is n't this obvious ? 
  election process is explicitly underscored in reference to `` rule of law '' proceedings - it 's argument to the lines of `` you guys elected hitler , so stop lecturing us on how our rule of law should look like '' . 
  nice try , greek ministry of tourism . 
  i 'm surprised they have n't been implemented in greece instead of other austerity measures - those tiny stickers are huge source of income - we use electronic ones for trucks in poland and it brings [ over 100 milion/month ] ( https://www.viatoll.pl/upload/images/2.png ) to road maintenance fund . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vignette_ ( road_tax ), 
  similar reports were posted by [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14038419 ) :  so , out with the likes of sleeping beauty and cinderella , and in with , for example , a book about two giraffes who find an abandoned baby crocodile and adopt it . 
  of course . 
  nothing wrong with that - and given recent trends in divorce rates , gay rights and adoption , it might be useful resource for young kids who might find themselves a bit lost in their family situation . 
  what i have problem with is the kindergarten in question has only books with couples like that , giving false impression that it 's `` normal '' ( and i do n't mean that in any negative sense ) , while in reality , it 's a tiny percentage of all adult relationships . 
  you completely missed a point of my comment . 
  i 'm talking about behaviour outside of warfare . 
  here 's current `` honour code '' of polish armed forces - http://skierniewice.wku.wp.mil.pl/pl/4458.html ( google translate does okay job translating it to english ) . 
  combat situations are referenced in only one paragraph , and it 's mostly referring to upholding international laws of conflict and respecting civilian population and pows . 
  please , tell me with straight face that someone exhibiting `` patriotism , bravery , honesty , responsibility , justice , truthfulness and professional solidarity '' is a bad thing . 
   what they do in america , having children pledge allegiance to the flag in schools , is wrong . 
  russia doing it to children by using the military is even worse . 
  yea , and in sweden you have stuff like [ this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gender-neutral-pre-school-accused-of-mind-control-2305983.html )  from a bookcase she pulls out a story about two male giraffes who are sad to be childless until they come across an abandoned crocodile egg . 
  nearly all the children 's books deal with homosexual couples , single parents or adopted children . 
  hoplites , legionairies , knights , samurai , uhlans , commissioned officers ... for centuries , military was not only about strength but also certain ideals and behaviours , like patriotism , duty , honour , responsibility - there 's absolutely nothing wrong in teaching such values to children - what 's your opinion on swedish scouterna ? 
  there 's ( unofficial ) limit of 2,5 kg meat per person , when entering russian side and ( official ) limit of 20 packs of cigaretes and 0.5 l of spirits on polish side of bezledy and grzechotki border passages . 
  there 's whole class of population whose daily job is crossing the border daily , back and forth , moving those goods legally under those limits - we call them `` ants '' . 
  on polish side , cheaper cigarettes and alcohol get sold off right after crossing the border , to specialized tiny shops , from where they get re-distributed via shady channels ( i live in warminsko-mazurskie voivodeship and over half of cigarete packs smoked by lower-income class have cyrillic letters ) . 
  how it goes on russian side , i do n't know . 
  those large-scale busts happen occasionally , usually when local meat producers in kaliningrad make enough stink , so that government is forced to make example of someone . 
  second part sucks , and i 'd consider it much more important than first one , but it 's not something that would warrant using `` atomic option '' by eu . 
   the commission 's key legal concern identified in the law on the organisation of ordinary courts relates to the discrimination on the basis of gender due to the introduction of a different retirement age for female judges ( 60 years ) and male judges ( 65 years ) . 
  this is contrary to article 157 [ of the ] treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ) and directive 2006/54 on gender equality in employment . 
  if that 's their key concern , it 's not bad . 
  retirement age for women and men is different in poland for every profession , not only judges . 
  also , it 's only an option - there 's nothing forcing you - you can keep working even past that date . 
  not even close by a long shot . 
  it 's sixth political opinion mag , which are relatively niche here - for comparison , we have five different gardening magazines ( `` gardener '' , `` i have garden '' , `` recipe for garden '' , `` my beautiful garden '' and `` my little garden '' ) which get more sales than this rag ( only `` magnolia '' and `` gardener 's world '' sold less units than `` gazeta polska '' ) . 
  odessa is great if you 're into night life , restaurants or shopping , but beaches really disappointed me . 
  portugal - the westernmost eastern european country . 
  i wrote a bit about it last night ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6pbyll/power_struggle_begins_in_poland_after_president/ ) . 
  today 's government-leaning media are a shitshow ( [ three president 's mistakes .

   in slovakia if president vetoes a bill , parliament can still overrule his veto by vote of more than half of all mps . 
  we have similar system in poland , but threshold is higher ( 60 % ) - pis ca n't get that many ( we have 460 seats in total . 
  they need 277 to overrule the veto . 
  pis holds 234 , quasi-oposition kukiz '15 has 32 , but they ca n't rely on every vote from them . 
  everyone else is rabidly aganist those bills . 
  also , as i reported earlier , 9-person faction from within pis coalition itself announced support for veto ) - with everyone mobilized and present , they have no chance to pass it ( that 's why i reported on rumours about snap assembly ) . 
  that 's precisely a point of protest - those new bills would put judges under control of current ruling party , eliminating independence - if it were to pass , after every election , new ruling party would `` purge '' old judges and replace them with `` their '' people . 
  also , since the judges in question decide whether elections were even valid in first place , if they were controlled by any party , they could simply remake elections if they ever lose it . 
   is the president allowed to introduce laws all laws proposal ultimately end up under vote of parliament . 
  president can submit his proposal ( alternative paths are `` circle '' of 10 or more members of parliament or `` citizens ' proposal '' with 100k valid signatures ) . 
   is the presidency the only political organ that judges laws by their constitutional validity ? 
  no , we have supreme court , but it 's seen as mostly compromised , after recent pis reforms ( see http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl-ad ( 2016 ) 026-e for more details )  poland is a bicameral democracy as far as i know , what does the senate - or equivalent of that - think of all this ? 
  yes , we have two houses in parliament - sejm and senat . 
  pis has majority in both . 
  senate passed the bill proposed by lower house without any amendment . 
   how many times can the president block a law , if a token change was made to the two blocked propositions , would he still be able to stop them ? 
  president has effectively `` strong veto '' power ( but not defined directly , but as a result of no time limit of signing of bill - by waiting until 4 year term of current parliament ends , it drops all proposed legislation in progress ) . 
  this is ** another ** gasoline tax - we have quite a few of them already . 
  in theory , that 0.25 was supposed to finance building and maintenance of tiny , local roads ( which are often awful and full of potholes - driving on them makes you seriously consider buying 4x4 off-road truck ) , but ( as usual ) only half of raised money will go to local governments , with rest staying with central authority , to use as they see fit ... 
   please check if they managed to sneak some other interesting legislation through while the general public was preoccupied with judicial reform . 
  that sort of thing happened here on a couple of occasions . 
  i 'm quite sure that this bill was the `` interesting '' one , under the cover of 0,25 pln gasoline tax - pis expected the later to take burnt of public attention and air time . 
  of course , we can go deeper and assume there 's third layer of ( even ) more nefarious bill passed , but this kind of 3d chess somehow does n't fit my pis image ... 
  during warsaw uprising , hungarian brigades stationing in warsaw got disarmed and put under house arrest in barracks by germans themselves , in fear of them joining fights on poles side ... 
  it 's not that easy . 
  all serious sanctions require unanimous vote - hungary will block them against poland and vice versa . 
  look - we 're talking about two completely different `` churches '' here . 
  i do n't deny charitable contributions of catholic church , but this one does none ( outside of some controversial political campaigns ) . 
  you know how there are some `` pastors '' in usa that own private jets ?
