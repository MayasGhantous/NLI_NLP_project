  that 's roughly the same vein ... 
  remember that story in bible about jesus chasing out traders from temple ? 
  * `` take these things away ; do not make my father 's house a house of trade '' *, 
   taking money , entirely voluntarily unlike taxes , from donations in the developed world like europe or north america , and then using them to feed , house or provide healthcare to people in congo or india is , in my view , precisely what the church should be doing . 
  if only that were the case , i would n't say a bad word about it . 
  sadly , the church in question is using that money to build more golden statues , more extravagant altar decorations and huge `` look how pious we are '' garden grounds - end result is 150m tall monument to human vanity , not christian virtues . 
  `` profitable '' should n't be first word that comes to mind when you describe church . 
  [ mcchurch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mcchurch ), 
   is this really what you want ths sub to be ? 
  for me , it looks like a backlash in response to ( now deleted ) '' * of europe '' sticky . 
  it should settle down in next few days . 
  that place is pretty much a symbol of everything that is wrong with catholicism in poland - built in middle of nowhere , at huge expense , mostly financed by poor babushkas donating half of their pensions every month , a multi-hectare spanning religious `` theme park '' with visitors being bussed from all over the country , paying overpriced tour packages . 
   if you are so upset , why not just import the products from other countries and sell them . 
  funnily enough , that 's what some entrepreneurs in poland have been doing . 
  there are some [ `` detergents from germany '' ] ( http://www.chgaj.pl/shop/81/ ) stores in most major towns - it 's pretty niche business , mostly operating out of low-rent tiny boxes in cheap malls , but they have some dedicated clientele - most people , however , do n't bother . 
  it 's a centre of large conspiracy - albania is a cover-up for large nato military base , and country does n't exist . 
  want proof ? 
  do you know any albanian ? 
  do you know someone who know any albanian ? 
  ever heard about any albanian ? 
  do you know any albanian book ? 
  can you recall a single word in albanian language ? 
  can you think of what currency albania is using ? 
  ever saw albanian car license plate ? 
  seen any photos reportedly taken in albania ? 
  what do you know of albanian cuisine ? 
  albanian music ? 
  can you recall albanian international calling country code ? 
  do you know any albanian company ? 
  albanian movie ? 
  can you recall any historical event occurring or connected with albania ? 
  15 . who is albania 's president ? 
  is it really republic ? 
  so ... when was the last time you heard about albanian elections ? 
  monarchy then ? 
  do they even have king ? 
  ever seen `` made in albania '' sticker on any product ? 
  what character encoding albanian computers are using ? 
  try booking a trip to albania with any travel company ... 23 . 
  try buying `` albanian phrasebook '' . 
  show me any university that has `` albanian philology '' course . 
  are they even speaking albanian ? 
  ask anyone around about what they know about albania . 
  give me name of at least one albanian football team player . 
  ask anyone about what they know about albania . 
  can you recall at least one football player born in albania ? 
  do you know any albanian music band ? 
  or at least a single albanian singer ? 
  at least one albanian compositor then ? 
  give me names of three albanian cities . 
  do n't use atlas - they are in on conspiracy . 
  alright ... name at least two rivers in albania . 
  sigh ... maybe one albanian monument ? 
  wake up , sheepie !, 
   we ca n't give gas we do n't have . 
  we 're busy reducing our own reliance on it for the same reason . 
  he 's referring to nord stream 2 project . 
   force poland and hungary to remove themself as well , there you have it 12 billions annually less to spend . 
  works for us . 
  we can just slap 1-2 % tax on all western companies operating in poland and it will more than make up for it ... or maybe ... work on some pan-european solution instead and fill up the gap in sensible way , that would benefit everyone - fighting vat fraud or tax evasion schemes seem like great places to start ... 
  no , that 's underground tunnel , just like cartels in mexico are using . 
  our border guards busted couple of legit alcohol pipelines built between russia/belarus and poland/baltics - record length is 2km ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2975934/smugglers-built-vodka-pipeline.html ) . 
  ever since our border guards got new high-tech toys , like ir sensors , it became very hard to do any construction works like those on border . 
  last i heard , [ smuggling boxes of cigarettes over the border with uav drones ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/swiat/dron-przemyt-papierosow-w-kaliningradzie-newsweek-pl,artykuly,286528,1.html ) is the new big thing ... 
   yay , subdued wage growth !, 
  do you want another greek crisis ? 
  because that 's how you would get another greek crisis ... 
  it 'd be insanely easy to ramp up wages ( frankly , i 'm surprised our populist government is not doing it ) - we have own currency and low debt to gdp ratio - but it 'd be akin to building castle on sand , as wages would n't reflect productivity - we already experienced similar artificial `` growth '' couple of decades ago ( 1970 - 1980 - so-called '' [ gierek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_gierek ) era '' . 
  we finally paid off loans taken up back then in 2012 ) and i 'm sure you remember what happened in 80s-90s ... current `` slow and steady '' approach to raising wages and standard of living works much better long-time , as it provides solid foundations to economic growth and makes industry more resilient to global market turbulences ( for example our gdp did n't shrink even in 2008 ) . 
   polish-lithuanian commonwealth had it at one point . 
  it did n't end well ... more and more privileges were granted to nobility , in exchange for their votes , with every passing election . 
  ultimately , every single noble had veto power over entire legislation ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberum_veto ) , which completely paralysed any attempt of reforms , leading to weak economy , incoherent foreign policy , and eventually - empire 's downfall and disappearing from maps for 123 years . 
  in some eu countries the percentage went down . 
  have some rights were actually taken away from lgbt population , or are we witnessing `` feature creep '' ? 
   we are perhaps the only country in the world where an elected parliamentarian asked the government if it secretly ` sprays ' people with a chemical , following the popular `` chemtrails '' conspiracy theory . 
  sadly , no . 
  ( http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm7.nsf/interpelacjatresc.xsp?key=53ac31db ) - our current minister of environment made official interpellation ( inquiry ) regarding it a few years back . 
  tl ; dr : a patent for store-operated `` free '' wi-fi hotspot with content filtering redirecting away from competitor 's websites . 
  why retarded stuff like that was even granted a patent in first place is discussion for another occasion , but even if they were to implement it , you can you know ... not use the provided free wifi and rely on your cellphone data instead . 
  yes , it 's legal to block/monitor your traffic on such hostpot , provided you grant them that right by clicking `` i agree '' or similar to terms of use presented on wifi 's captive portal . 
   i could n't tell you why that is however czech republic country name is poland is just `` czechy '' . 
  no idea what grenfell tower was using , but over here it 's 7-15 cm thick plates of styrofoam . 
  as per eu recommendations , all thermal isolation that 's being used for insulation of buildings over 25m high has to be non-flammable/self-extinguishing ( they are mixing in hbcd or polyfr during production ) . 
   mm , i think if you slapped on some fresh paint they would n't be so bad . 
  a lot of similar buildings from soviet era in poland got thermal insulation + bright painting treatment . 
  they look pretty okay . 
  almost entire australian population lives on coast - middle is almost uninhabited desert . 
  australia ran out of scale for temperatures on weather map few years ago - they used up all shades of red when it reached 54 in central regions , so they just re-purposed shades of pink for temperatures 50 + http://i.imgur.com/ufuad2h.jpg, 
   flights are n't cheap !, 
  they are , from over here . 
  roundtrip warsaw - egypt is less than 300 eur right now . 
  it used to be even cheaper , but wizzair stopped flying to hurghanda after [ metrojet flight 9268 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metrojet_flight_9268 ) in oct 2015 . 
   i 'm pretty sure there 's a eu regulation , but it gives some leeway to the national governments to implement it . 
  there 's probably some joke about uk opt-out here , but given the situation ... 
  bomb itself will take shorter , yes . 
  but we 're talking about entire system , including delivery - flying single b-29 might 've worked for hiroshima , but it would n't get anywhere near ( presumably ) moscow - you need to fit warhead on modern ballistic missile , design fuse and failsafe systems and myriad other issues - compare it to current tests that north korea is performing . 
  pretty much , yes . 
  if germany wanted , they could have their own nuclear weapons within 2 to 3 years . 
  same for japan . 
  canada , australia or netherlands could build them in 3-5 years .
