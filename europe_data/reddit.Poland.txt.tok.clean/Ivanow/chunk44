  virtually every industrialized nation today could obtain them within a decade if they were willing to commit to it - the fact that only a handful of nations have them almost a century after underlying technology was invented is insane success of international diplomacy . 
  without nato guarantees , and nuclear sharing , way more countries would maintain at least a token arsenal . 
  i 'm getting a cold sweat thinking about macierewicz with access to red button ... 
  yes , there are some stupid laws regarding drinking in public spaces , just like in many other countries ( ever wondered why homeless in usa-made movies wrap their alcohol in brown paperbags ? ), 
  , but they are being successfully challenged in courts and rolled back . 
  ( [ recent supreme court rulling , excluding `` waterside '' pathways from definition of `` road '' as it pertains to `` public drinking '' laws ] ( http://wawalove.pl/sad-najwyzszy-mozna-pic-nad-wisla-a25378 ) . 
  also , that bill was passed in 2001 , when it was left-wing `` united left alliance '' not some prohibitionist theocrats , who were in government ) 2 . 
  how many such incidents happen every year ? 
  i can recall only a couple such incidents . 
  even lgbtq ngo report ( https://kph.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/hnm-raport-pl-www.pdf ) puts it at less than 1 % of homosexuals experiencing physical violence . 
  also , it 's not some state-sponsored anti-gay campaign - out of that 1 % , only 0.5 % ( so 0.00005 % of total occurences ) were perpetrated by police or other state official . 
  while i do n't deny that society attitude toward homosexuals could use some improvement , it 's nowhere near the level of persecution in russia or some islamic countries . 
  church itself ca n't censor shit . 
  no one ever got arrested or jailed from art . 
  196 kk ( `` religious feelings '' article you mentioned ) in last 3 decades - first case was 20 hours of community service , second case was 5000pln ( ~ 1200 eur ) fine , third one got dismissed - that 's the only three published cases in media when some artist was persecuted from that article that i can recall .

  paste from one of my previous comments about this topic : `` processing asylum requests of opportunistic economic migrants who made their way to europe , rather than truly vulnerable families , stuck in camps in jordan or syria is biggest issue , and kind of root of the problem . 
  any arrivals should be ferried back to those camps ( which should receive increased funding ) , with processing cost of that ferry being billed to country the boat originally departed from . 
  any countries refusing to cooperate , by providing documentation or refusing to accept denied asylum seekers should have all eu foreign aid funds withdrawn ( that money could go towards funding our border service and fund refugee camps in syria/jordan/turkey ) and/or be subject of economic embargo . 
  asylum requests should be consulted with our intelligence services to weed out potential isis sleeper cells and war criminals , contain fingerprints ( no , trying to prevent one person from having fourteen different identities and protect citizens and other refugees is not racist ) , and ideally include as much documentation as possible ( `` refugees '' from morocco trowing out their passports and claiming to be syrian is outrageous ) - however , i understand that with all bombs and shit flying out over there , keeping hold of documentation might be difficult , so some kind of `` vouch '' system , where local , already granted refugee status , communities , could take some paperless person they might know or coming from the same area as them , in exchange to being `` responsible '' for them , might be desirable ( i 'm not lawyer however , and this idea might be both illegal and corruption-inducing ) . 
  asylum request should be processed on eu level , with accepted ones being assigned to one of member states ; refugee accepted and assigned to poland , portugal or bulgaria who moves to germany or sweden should have their status immediately withdrawn and flown back within 24 hours to country of their citizenship and have all their possible asylum requests automatically denied . 
  countries in eastern europe should increase their refugee capacity , relocating some of those residing in west and south currently - we have plenty of old former-kolhoz buildings and flats on countryside that are rotting away , which could be renovated cheaply and house tens thousands of people ( it wo n't be as rich as flat in hamburg , paid by german taxpayer , but it 's definitely safe , which genuine refugees will appreciate ) . '', 
  you know who else is famous ? 
  just treat mikke the same way . 
  the only time i saw some greek ep members was on short clip when shulz was kicking two golden dawn mps out of parliament for some racist remarks , but i know their actions do n't reflect greek society as a whole . 
  that 's pretty much how pis won elections in poland ( there were other factors at play too , but migration was one of most debated ) . 
  the more commission pushes the issue , the more opposition will mount ( in poland even parties that used to support migrant quotas ( like po ) are now [ rejecting it ] ( https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/grzegorz-schetyna-jestesmy-przeciwni-przyjmowaniu-nielegalnych-imigrantow-6121093562111617a ) ) and another governments like in poland and hungary will start popping up . 
  is this really the hill eu wants to die on ? ... 
   poland is known for janusz korwin-mikke . 
  yes , the guy who was mp only once , during our first post-communist election , when there was no vote threshold and he still got less votes than joke '' [ polish beer lovers ' party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers%27_party ) '' ( which got 16 seats , compared to mikke 's party 3 ) . 
  he was n't in polish parliament since then and the only reason he got into brussels is that collectively , no-one gives a shit about european election here ( 20 % voter turnout ) , giving boost to tiny parties with motivated fanbase . 
   i sincerely hope poles are n't that dumb to fall for this i wrote about this three weeks ago - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/690c1t/polands_president_calls_for_constitutional/dh2ns0d/  recent polls show that poles are happy with our current constitution and referendum is most likely to fail ( cbos poll from march 2017 : 30 % yes , 49 % no ) . 
   the risk you accept is a core concept of lending out money .

  '' \u021aepe\u0219 '' literally means `` impaler '' in romanian , 
   did vlad tepes do anything to earn that nickname ? 
  well ... [ dude was eating breakfast while watching captive ottomans getting impaled in front of his table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yq3l6zf.jpg ) ... 
   but are there still conflicts and animosity between eu members ? 
  when i went to greece they hated germans and when i went to germany they did n't like the french . 
  europe has relatively large population squeezed on tiny landmass , with multiple cultures and long history , pretty much everyone was in conflict with each other at some point in time . 
  now , in modern times those animosities took a back seat , replaced by working together , but sometimes surface in form of sarcastic comments about `` paying denbts '' or sheep-shagging , depending on current events ( for example greece 's hate on germans was due to their debt crisis and harsh fiscal policy implemented by german-led institutions , but if you see later news , a lot of tourists from all over europe are vacationing in greece now , hoping to help their economy ) - imagine living in flat next to noisy neighbour - you can argue with him all the time , but if earthquake stuck , you 'd be first to rush to help him ... 
  i learned about it from article about remote `` polish '' lands ( jaksa and [ polonezk\u00f6y ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polonezk%c3%b6y ) are the only two i remember now ) couple of years ago , that got linked on wykop.pl - polish reddit-equivalent ) when writing my comment , i copied chinese name and dates from http://www.tvn24.pl/magazyn-tvn24/polska-miala-kiedys-granice-z-chinami-jaksa-sukces-ktory-przerosl-marzenia,92,1803 . 
  english sources are relatively sparse , since it was rather tiny , regional conflict - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaxa_ ( state ) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikifor_chernigovsky list only polish sources in bibliography . 
  somehow on topic : poland had tiny kingdom within china 's border - jaksa ( \u96c5\u514b\u8428 ) . 
  long story short : polish nobleman , nicefor czernichowski , had his sister abducted and raped by russian voivode in 1660 . 
  he led a rebellion and killed him in revenge . 
  afterwards , forced to flee , his group settled in burned-down stronghold near amur river . 
  as his local fame grew , they eventually got recognition of emperor in peking , with some court correspondence even written in polish . 
  knowing that he will be unable to fend off both china and russia , in 1669 he started paying tribute to moscow - one year later , china sent punitive expedition , which got defeated . 
  in 1674 moscow tzar gave pardon to czernichowski and named him vice-voivode of that region . 
  he died due to wounds during expedition to manchuria in 1675 . 
  china sent large expedition force - in 1683 main stronghold got destroyed after 10 days siege . 
  til . 
  thanks . 
  poles card does n't give them right to work in czechia - if they are working there , they must have obtained working permit from your own government , using standard channels . 
  our government is playing long game . 
  it 's no secret that we have negative population outlook - bringing as many ambitious , young workers can only benefit our economy . 
  even that 500 + is less than average taxes paid back by minimum wage worker ( if you count all payments , like social security , vat on groceries , local tax , income tax ... ) and it increases chances that ukrainian immigrant might want to stay in poland . 
   p.s. 
  anyways i read ( in the economist i think ) poland is already helping by giving lots of polish passports ... we 're not giving out passports like candies . 
  however , there 's a thing , called `` pole 's card '' ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karta_polaka ) which is relatively easy to obtain , given regional history , and is kind of `` halfway '' citizenship - you get a lot of perks ( including residence/working permit , free education and healthcare ) , but they apply only in poland , without burdening our western neighbors . 
  it 's a huge mess if you are n't from exempt countries . 
  application form is 4 pages long , and you need to provide various documentation , including trip plans , plane and hotel bookings , bank account statements etc. 
  you also need to pass interview with immigration official and pay 60-90 eur processing fee ( it 's reduced to 35 eur for some countries , including ukraine ) . 
  you do realize it 's only for tourism purposes ? 
  we have a lot of agreements like those with countries all over the world - you might as well start complaining that peru will join eu soon ( they have similar agreement as ukraine ) . 
  yes , it sounds wrong , but that 's legal documents for you ... 
  some countries started passing laws that require using simpler/easier to understand version , in addition to long-winded legal one ( in poland it 's loan contracts that started the trend , since they required pretty much a law degree to be understood before ) . 
  because those faraway lands have different statuses and i do n't want any frenchman correcting me that it 's `` special autonomous region '' , `` associated territory '' , `` overseas department '' or something like that instead of `` french overseas territory '' - basically i used the quotes to denote that i mean `` not mainland france '' instead of `` french oversea territory '' which probably has some specific legal definition . 
  i had to look up this place after seeing this picture , judging from upvotes other people had no idea where it is either , but the extent of my curiosity did n't cover administrative nuances , so i used quotes just in case - as / u/venessian pointed above , it is in fact `` french overseas territory '' in full legal meaning , but well ... 
  mayotte is a tiny island between madagascar and mozambique - one of numerous french `` overseas territories '' - 8000km away from paris . 
  not really . 
  it 's built on huge plot of land in the middle of nowhere - nearby village has less than 1000 residents - i do n't think there 's big demand for library this size in that region . 
  it 's already happening , without any official eu endorsement - http://news.gtp.gr/2017/01/05/greece-tourism-body-expects-record-arrivals-2017-spending-key/ `` topping the list are the german and uk markets which appear to have made double the bookings compared to last year , followed closely by france and denmark . '' . 
  brace yourselves , white walkers are coming . 
  english news sources have n't picked on it yet , it seems .

  personally , i 'm getting flashbacks from recent edrogan 's power grab in turkey . 
  our rulling party does n't have 2/3 majority needed to ammend constitution outright , but following binding referendum , new one can be written from scratch ( that 's how we got our current one from 1997 , after 53 % of population voted for it in referendum ) . 
  recent polls show that poles are happy with our current constitution and referendum is most likely to fail ( cbos poll from march 2017 : 30 % yes , 49 % no ) . 
  if this trend continues , you can expect eastern european countries to set up similar protectionist measures in other direction - creating artificial administrative barriers , protecting local companies from competition from west - similar to how china , korea or japan operates ... at which point , we might as well dissolve single market as it will be completely unworkable . 
  just courier it to yourself . 
  dhl should n't cost more than 100 eur for insured economy package and there are even cheaper options available , if you shop around . 
  i would n't call it clever , more like a early sign of failed state - it 's outright bribing on systemic level , donating them car to make them look the other way while you extort businesses `` protection money '' is no different than handling them envelopes of cash outright . 
  even if it 's not gangs but legit businesses doing it , it endangers one of pillars of democracy - equality under law - wealthy businessman gives one to local police - can he expect some kind of preferable treatment ? 
  say , two requests are made at the same time - one from ordinary folk , other from wealthy businessmen , known for supporting local police force - where do you think dispatch will send the only patrol car they have first ? 
  or some kind of kickbacks/preference when placing offer for public procurement contracts ? 
  you can see how `` campaign contributions '' work in shaping usa laws/policies . 
  eastern parts of ukraine have plenty of `` volunteers '' like that , driving around and collecting `` donations '' to support their troops . 
  please , do n't turn into second ukraine . 
   zywiec and tyskie sadly , both are rather poor representatives , taste-wise - mass produced , mass-marketed , only slightly better than `` tesco value '' ones you can get for 0,25 eur/can ... 
  i 'm not saying you should drink only craft beer from companies you never heard of , like some hipster , but `` per\u0142a '' and `` kasztelan '' are both mass-produced and taste way better ( at least for me ) than the two you mentioned . 
   believe it or not many of them are still mobile due to private donations and free service/repairs from local garages . 
  in poland we had private donations to police in 90s too . 
  it was often gangs who donated them , in a kind of reverse-racket . 
   if you pay no one within the country , you suddenly end up with a surplus . 
  that might be the case for company or home budget , but not on state level . 
  remember , most countries make money from circulation of cash/economy activity of their citizens - `` hoarding '' cash is much worse approach than letting it stay in ecosystem and shaving a couple percent everytime it changes hands - you pay out salary to state employee , he pays rent with it ( you collect sales tax/vat ) , his landlord uses this money to buy groceries ( you collect vat ) , grocery store owner uses proceeds to renovate his store ( vat on construction materials ) , construction company pays out salary to their workers ( and income taxes ) , who need to pay rent for their homes ( and the circle starts over ) ... 
  it 's like killing hen that lays out eggs . 
  you end up with nice short term gain , but you 're much worse off long-term .
