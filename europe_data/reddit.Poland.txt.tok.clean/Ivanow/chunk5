  i always mix those two - they sound very similar in polish ... ) - they just killed them for `` sport '' and bragging rights in a sick kind of `` contest '' , where whoever kills the most is the biggest macho . 
  our ecologist groups made a protest in front of their embassy , but i do n't know how it ended ... 
  * insanity is repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results . 
  as / u/venacz mentioned , they are subsidized by local governments - this is one of remnants of socialism , that actually worked ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bar_mleczny ) . 
  great idea . 
  right now , many people use their regional province flag , and those often are n't widely known outside of their home country , especially the more obscure ones ( like , i know bavaria is in germany , but wtf is vojvodina ... ) , and it 's often useful to know where the poster is from ... 
  that 's a shitload of cash over here . 
  i do n't think there 's a house in my city that would cost that much . 
  ( for comparison , my current apartment is 120sqm , 4bedrooms and costed around 380.000 pln ) . 
   the day of holy mary , a nation wide holiday , and conisdered by the local orthodox church one of the three most imporant holidays , along with christmas and easter . 
  do n't orthodox have calendar shifted by like two weeks ? 
  i know they celebrate christmas on beginning of january over here ... is day of holy mary the same in both calendars , or does greek orthodox use the same calendar as catholic ones . 
   like most of europe does of course . 
  poor norway :(, 
   and we should n't increase our exposure to russian energy either ca n't we just make a pipeline straight to middle east and show russia a finger ? 
  even if we do n't completely abandon russian gas , having other sources of it puts pressure to reduce price on them and they wo n't be able to use it as a political weapon . 
  it caused plenty of short-term troubles for our exporters , since `` easy '' route got blocked off and they had to scatter for new markets . 
  nowadays apples get sent as far away as singapore and japan , meat goes to china ( chengdu-lodz train no longer has to drive back empty ) and so on . 
  overall , i think having export partners that do n't use trade as a weapon and throw a tantrum everytime something goes against their mind is net positive . 
   anyway , we got the money . 
  and this is great marketing for our flowers . 
  people are smuggling our flowers , awesome . 
  can confirm , got apples banned . 
  sales rose 20 % year-to-year .

  last megathread was posted a week ago . 
  they have n't added any recent news either . 
  i do n't know the laws behind it , but plenty of people come over from uk to get dental implants done ( nhs does n't cover them ? ), 
  in poland . 
  gdansk/gdynia/sopot has many clinics ( both dental and plastic surgery ) that advertise towards scandinavians as well . 
   our qualified dentists provide comprehensive dental treatment in gdansk , poland ( direct flights ) according to highest european standards performed in our modern dental clinic ( iso-certified ) for 50-70 % less than at your local dentist . 
  we also handle all necessary arrangements , if requested : accommodation in a nearby hotel or apartments and airport -  hotel -  clinic transfer for first-time patients . 
  * 1683 , never forget !, 
  it goes much earlier than that . 
  ukraine was part of polish-luthuanian commonwealth centuries before russian imperialism was really a thing and we 've been using `` na ukrainie '' ever since then ( note that we do n't have any border disputes and fully accept their independence . 
  it simply sounds `` odd '' to say `` w ukrainie '' ) interesting fact : current region of donbass , where `` separatists '' are fighting was conquered from golden horde after battle of blue waters ( year 1362 ) . 
  since eastern ukraine had very `` interesting '' neighbours ( you know , mongols , ottomans , tatars , cossacks ... ) it changed ownership regularly - starting from 16th century , it 's called `` wild fields '' ( in the same context as `` wild west '' in america was ) in official polish documents . 
  malta and iceland maybe ? 
  yup . 
  got it now . 
   solar-power  norway that 's a bold plan , let 's see if it pays off ... wind and hydro-electricity should work great tho . 
  that 's pretty much how it works nowadays . 
  there are various `` transition periods '' for freedom of movement ( for example when poland joined , we could move to uk immediately , but germany wanted to wait few years - negotiated on country by country basis ) , some poorer eu countries are n't part of schengen , many did n't adopt euro , cohesion fund money for development is sent to countries that have gdp below 90 % of eu average and so on ... 
  that 's some / r/nottheonion title . 
  our first president after fall of prl , lech wa\u0142\u0119sa , promised `` a new japan '' ... ^ ( i notice a beginning of a trend here ) . 
  best korea already [ has one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_star_os ) . 
  the keyword - `` investment '' . 
  just look at poland , we quadrupled our gdp ppp in 25 years . 
  companies that got in the beginning and invested ~ ~ in eastern poland ~ ~ recorded four-five digits roi . 
  most of the times , farmers insure their crops against cases these ( well , locust is a bit unexpected , but having crops ravaged by hail or flooded is relatively common occurrence in poland and farmers get all loses and portion of expected profits covered by insurance companies . 
  i 'm pretty sure similar policies are available in russia . ), 
  [ ah , brings back memories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_against_the_potato_beetle )  a polish newsreel from 1950 , `` walka z stonk\u0105 '' ( `` the struggle against the beetle '' ) , claimed that `` the progressive opinion of the world has rightfully condemned the crimes of the american pilots who dropped tremendous amounts of the potato beetle on the fields of the german democratic republic ... from where the beetle invaded polish territory '' . 
  the news report went on to describe the campaign launched by the polish ministry of agriculture to eradicate the pest through the use of ddt ( azotox in its soviet bloc version ) , vigilance on poland 's baltic coast , engagement of the polish air force , and the general mobilization of society , particularly the youth . 
  the newsreel concluded that `` the american pest will be unsuccessful both in poland and germany . 
  the warmongers ' provocation will crash and burn . 
  everyone to war against the beetle !, 
  in 80s , our telecom melted two trucks of 10 kopek coins ( 1/10 of ussr ruble ) when people figured out those could be used in payphones . 
  how is that situation different from someone committing suicide after having his house foreclosed after refinancing mortgage in order to pay just one more `` unforseen obstacle before money is released '' ? 
  many people raised similar ethical concerns as you , on forum while the gig was up , eventually it 's only their own greed that embarked them on that dangerous journey . 
  baiters used exactly the same methods the scammers usually pull on their victims . 
  the fact that the phantom money was originally intended to go to humanitarian camps for refugees , and the scammers have no objection in taking those does n't help their cause imo . 
  [ the chad-darfur safari ] ( http://www.419eater.com/html/roadtochaddarfur/background.html ) [ harry potter ] ( http://www.419eater.com/html/joyce_ozioma.htm ) [ bust statue ] ( http://www.419eater.com/html/bigman.htm ), 
   you 're wasting your time responding to them unless you want to get conned . 
  some people get a kick out of baiting the scammers to perform various silly tasks . 
  pictures with silly text does n't even raise an eybrow anymore , but some stuff is pretty impressive , like the dude who got woodcarved bust statue , or that one scammer who handwritten entire first harry potter book . 
  arugably the most famous one is the story of baiters sending a scammer on a few weeks trip to first chad and then darfur , sudan , in order to receive the money . 
  if that were the case , would n't that require isis representative to press charges ? 
  i wonder if we can get him to testify in court ... 
  laws vary from country to country , but usually receiving any funding from terrorist organization gets you jailed , even if said funding came from scamming said organization . 
   europe does n't have a problem buying energy from russia as definitely not european , or european enough ukrainian people are killed . 
  it 's more a problem of infrastructure , not willingness - we recently started few projects to diversify the sources , like tanker ships ports , but we simply do n't have many pipes down south to get oil/gas directly from middle east . 
  russian-owned * lukoil * gas stations are widely boycotted in entire eastern europe ever since ukraine mess started , and they [ had to pull out from those markets ] ( http://www.rt.com/business/178012-lukoil-sells-gas-stations-europe/ ), 
  we had similar advertisement ban laws for some time . 
  went as well as expected from a country that spent half of previous century skidding commie censorship ... 
  instead of w\u00f3dka ( vodka ) we had advertisements of [ `` wtk soplica '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srkszhdw294 ) ( techincally `` wtk '' stands for `` wypoczynkowa turystyka konna '' ( `` recreational horseback riding '' ) , wutka phonetically being the same as w\u00f3dka and the resort name the same as leading spirit brand is totally concidential . 
  same with [ '' \u0142\u00f3dka bols '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spbssfy_xw0 ) ( sailing boat this time , '' \u0142\u00f3dka '' and `` w\u00f3dka '' sound kinda similar ) . 
  we also had `` alcohol-free beer brand '' loophole , which made all beer companies advertise their non-alcoholic versions that happened to look the same as normal ones , and there was urban legend going on that someone 's friend 's father actually seen the non-alcoholic variant in some small local shop in tiny town while on business delegation ... 
  above law was openly mocked even during the advertisements themselves , with one actor going on with praise how popular and liked [ * wink * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scs44dkg1b0 ) alcohol-free beer has become recently . 
  they changed the laws soon after that series aired ... nowadays the only limitation i think is that they have to air after 23:00 and not obviously target them toward children . 
  let 's make a sticky megathread for them !, 
  [ \u017bubr beer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/zubr ) are about the only ones worth mentioning . 
  '' \u017bubr '' means `` bison '' in english and they use various polish idioms - ca n't really translate it well , but for example latest one is `` kolej na \u017cubra '' with bison blocking raiload track . 
  `` kolej '' means `` raiload '' but `` kolej na ... '' means `` time for ... '' . 
  different one is '' \u017bubr podchodzi do grila '' - literally it means `` bison comes near the bbq '' , but also `` bison goes well with bbq '' , and so on ... 
  shush . 
  only * certain kinds * of immigrants are not allowed to be discussed . 
   global warming is n't that extreme tho dunno man , there are historical records of baltic sea freezing completely and people travelling from poland to sweden on sledges ... also , i did n't meant literally crashing with iceberg , titanic-style . 
  there are many other perils of taking wooden sailship to very cold seas , like for example ice forming on outer layer of ship , ropes and sails - this needs to be chopped off , or else the added weight might sink it . 
   i think accurate maps were considered valuable militarily , so only english mapmakers were allowed to survey the land and the maps were n't disclosed to anybody . 
  that is correct . 
  [ rutters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rutter_%28nautical%29 ) ( basically a precursor of modern maps , which were used for deep sea navigation before we learned how to fix [ longitude ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longitude_rewards ) ) had very strict laws governing possession of them by non-nationals - kinda similar to the ones governing access to `` top secret '' information nowadays . 
  for example , spain required by law , that every foreign navigator found in possession of spanish rutters , to have ship burned down and entire crew killed . 
  back when those maps were drawn , sailing far up north was really dangerous ( you know , icebergs and stuff ... ) . 
  even during age of sails , many lives were lost when trying to find mythical `` northern route '' connecting india , philippines etc. 
  by going north across the asia , instead of under africa ( no suez canal back then ) . 
  they could 've drawn `` here be dragons '' there , but what 's the point ... mediteran was much more important for sailors and trade since pretty much beginning of european civilizations ( phoenicians ... ) and it 's a given that maps , especially ones comming from ottoman empire includes it whole ( if it makes you happier , ones from polish-lithuanian commonwealth have much more detailed parts of baltic sea , southern sweden and western parts of nowadays ' russia ( majority of our oversea trade was sending wheat from ports of gdansk/danzig to netherlands ),
