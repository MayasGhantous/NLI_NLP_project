  it is a problem and it needs a solution . 
  personally , i 'd prefer more practical approach and send out soldiers that raze the smuggler 's boats on african coast before any refugees board them in first place ( if libya or any other country complains , we should tell them to stfu and if they were policing their own areas , we would n't have to do it ourselves . ), 
   if italy deported them back to lybia the echr would order us to pay each migrant 15k euros in damages again . 
  is it that hard to understand ? 
  shrink echr budget by 15k everytime they do that and begin housing the refugees in/around their buildings . 
  see how quickly the attitude changes . 
  back in 90s , we did n't care much about political correctness over in my country and when some ngo started crying that we should take more chechen refugees , someone sent them a questionarie how many they want to have allocated at their headquaters . 
  problem died down quickly . 
   so is italy , which can issue schengen visa to all migrants and let them go to the rest of eu . 
  do you really think any of those migrants will decide to head over to czech republic or slovakia over germany or sweden once italy grants him document that allows him to settle in any eu country he choses to ? 
  i do n't know exact number for refugee stipend in slovakia , but in poland it 's 790 pln ( = 188 eur ) , and i do n't think it 's much higher over there ... 
   man c'mon do n't be pathetic . 
  even if you would offer them an absurd amount of money they wouldnt accept . 
  did n't australia work out something similar with cambodia , who agreed to take on some `` unwanted '' folks , in exchange for ~ ~ fat bribe ~ ~ $ 41m development aid ? 
  bank deposits under 100k eur are guaranteed not by our government , but by special inter-bank fund ( [ `` bankowy fundusz gwarancyjny '' ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/bankowy_fundusz_gwarancyjny ) ) where portion of every regulated bank 's earnings was deposited in past 20 years or so . 
  at this point there 's i think only a single bank that this fund 's stored cash would be unable to cover in 100 % - pko bp . 
  additionaly , our financical regulatory body issued `` recommendations '' that aim to reduce bank 's exposures to possible `` toxic '' assets - for example you can no longer take out mortgage for 100 % of property value - you need to have 15 % buy-in . 
  ( this started at 10 % and is increasing gradually until it reaches 20 or 30 % ) . 
  ukraine was richer than poland when both countries gained independence in 1990 . http://i.imgur.com/as5vuqm.jpg, 
  actually , we have clauses against having more than 60 % gdp debt in constitution ( art 216.5 - * it shall be neither permissible to contract loans nor provide guarantees and financial sureties which would engender a national public debt exceeding three-fifths of the value of the annual gross domestic product . 
  more than 55 % is `` warning threshold '' defined in our legislature and has certain `` austerity '' safeguards , like tying retirement payouts increases to inflation , requirement for government to introduce proposals to reducing the debt , decrease of budget for certain bodies , like president 's house and so on ... 
  plenty of eu funds went into piping modernization . 
  i do n't have exact data , but to my knowledge sanepid ( our government body responsible for health-related stuff . 
  they make controls in restaurations , oversee vaccinations , check quality of water in public pools and so on ... ) is regularly checking quality of water both at pump and at end-users taps . 
  to elaborate on point made by / u/ajuc : yes , the tap water in most of poland is of very good quality - most cities pump it up from 200-400m ( triternary and quaternary periods ) - the one from my town is actually better than [ most bottled waters sold ] ( http://olsztyn.wm.pl/210958,olsztynska-woda-z-kranu-lepsza-niz-mineralna.html ) ( [ l\u00f3d\u017a muncipality actually got sued for unfair competition ] ( http://metrocafe.pl/metrocafe/1,145523,17255864,producenci_wody_butelkowanej_groza_sadami_za_zachwalanie.html ) ) as for '' - anka '' in name , it 's kinda a naming convention that does n't translate well into english . 
  basically it implies that the water brand comes from certain drill ( `` muszynianka '' gets pumped from `` muszyna zdr\u00f3j '' source , `` na\u0142\u0119czowianka '' from `` na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w zdr\u00f3j '' and so on ... ( `` zdr\u00f3j '' in polish city names comes from `` zdrowie '' ( `` health '' ) and implies places with good climate for treatment and roughly translates to `` spa '' . 
  someone posted some pics from one switzerland referendum voting recently ( there was some kind of fad where people from various countries posted pictures of how voting looks like over there ) and what i liked the most was that each question had accompanying pamphlet with two different organization writing a short summary about `` why you should vote `` no '' ? '', 
  and `` why you should vote `` yes '' ? '', 
  - i 'd like similar standard implemented across entire eu for all referendums . 
  it was 270-ish thousand euros last time i checked .

   currency depreciations can be a good thing . 
  free-floating pln is credited ( among big domestic market ) as the most important factor that saved poland from recession in 2008, 
   $ 5,529 polan so poor :(, 
  they wo n't . 
  it 's fixed-funding campaign , so they receive the money only if they manage to get 1,6 bil $ in a week . 
  chances for that are next to nil . 
  if they do n't reach the goal , all donations are refunded . 
  oh , tabloids are having a field day over here in poland ... ( aszdziennik - kinda like theonion ) : [ `` crisis is over . 
  greece announced that it became a bank . 
  eu automatically annulled all debts '' ] ( http://aszdziennik.pl/114987,no-i-po-kryzysie-grecja-oglosila-ze-jest-bankiem-ue-automatycznie-umorzyla-jej-wszystkie-dlugi ) [ `` eu bankrupt ?

  will grexit happen ? 
  greece crisis is really helping out germany 's industry and export by keeping the euro price down ( last year 's exports , imports and trade surplus hit record-high values ) . 
  pasting insightful comment from / r/worldnews :  they 're referring to the early islamic wars when they left the peninsula and defeated rome . 
  sunni extremists often refer to western armies as `` rome '' and iran as `` persia '' to set the stage that they 're about to repeat the early islamic wars when they defeated the world 's two largest armies ( rome and persia ) . 
  back when this happened the ragtag arab army of united nomadic tribes were seemingly unstoppable . 
  isis generally refer to the iraqi and iranian government as `` safavids '' after the safavid dynasty of persia , who converted sunni iraq and persia to shia . 
  think of this like how british called germans `` the huns '' during wwi , obviously they knew better . 
  they are literally living out middle ages fantasy and believe in ragnarok-like battle between force of good and evil  the islamic state awaits the army of `` rome , '' whose defeat at dabiq , syria , will initiate the countdown to the apocalypse . 
  any idea how it might affect non-greek europeans ? 
  i do n't want to make a separate thread for it , but two questions come to my mind ... 1 . 
  what happens to current eur banknotes that were printed in greece ( y series ) . 
  will it still be legal tender , the same way the ones from germany or lithuania are , or will i have to exchange them to drachmas ( ? ), 
  before i 'll be able to spend them ? . 
  how the possible default might affect eur exchange rate versus usd or gbp ? 
  on one hand there 's plenty of debt that defaults , on other , average strength of economies that remain in eurozone goes up ... 
  i got some savings in euros , as portion of my income is paid in them , should i exchange them to something more stable , or will the exchange rate wo n't be affected much ? 
  poland had hyperinflation in 90s that effectively wiped out everyone 's savings , but we rebounded pretty quickly ( and we got shiny new banknotes in the process , as old 1.000.000 z\u0142otys got turned into 100 z\u0142otys ), 
  original article ( http://www1.wdr.de/studio/essen/themadestages/busexperiment-100.html ) mentions that 21 years ago , similar experiment occured in m\u00fcnster university cafeteria and no-one complained back then - they praise how the society 's attitude improved since then . 
  [ pierogi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=pierogi ) would be most `` universal '' one from poland ( albeit , it 's very popular in many other central/eastern europe countries ) . 
  [ borscht soup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borscht ) is another strong contender , but ukrainians might want to take that one for themselves . 
  was n't there a quote by someone along the lines of `` if you are affraid of losing your job to someone who just arrived here , barely speaks the language and has absolutely no local contacts , then how much are you worth ? '', 
  in poland it 's also forbidden . 
  you might also get beaten up , if you do it in front of wrong people ( punks and antifa guys especially , but some `` normal '' guys might not take to it kindly as well , depending on their family history ), 
  no idea . 
  their products would have easier access to western markets for sure . 
  there 's also a possibility of visa-less travel to entire eu ( currently they are limited to two northernmost voivodeships of poland due to bi-lateral agreements ) in the future . 
  i know the russia 's ruling party representatives lost the local elections there , but they probably do n't want to secede anyway - russia sends quite a lot resources toward them to prop-up military base there . 
  i live roughly 30 minutes ride from kaliningrad border and the best solution for me would be for them to turn into singapore-like independent country-state . 
  they often use shipping addresses in uk either to abandoned plots or unsuspecting victims who forward them to africa . 
  also , i never said they wo n't do it , just that some additional verification might be necessary before ordered items are shipped . 
  many shops are wary about sending stuff abroad , thanks to big batch of `` customers '' from nigeria and ivory coast ordering stuff a few years ago . 
  all european languages ( except hungarian and finnish ) have the same roots of latin , german or slavic languages and as a result , many words are very similar . 
  nope , i have no affiliation with them . 
  i 'm mostly lurking on both here and wykop.pl - just wanted to clear the misunderstanding / u/overact1ve had , that there is some organization behind this . 
  responses from this reddit thread are discussed there . 
  most users seem agree that there 's no point in dragging current german colors into this , but some people think that this kind of `` mistake '' is exactly the same as calling death camps `` polish '' in first place . 
  personally , i find this entire action tasteless . 
  exactly . 
  this is n't any official organization 's work - basically people on wykop.pl ( polish reddit-equivalent website ) got annoyed about usage of `` polish death camp '' phrase and started this action - guys knowledgeable with photoshop submitted some designs , someone working at printing house will print them during off-hours , they collected funds to buy up billboard space , another dude set up the website and so on ... 
   and they will return once they realize that they do n't qualify for benefits outside of poland . 
    190 $  0 $ or more likely - turn to crime or illegal work there ... daily beggar income in germany  monthly refugee stipend in poland, 
  poland does n't oppose quotas either . 
  we just want all refugees to be counted , not only the ones coming from south , but also ukrainians from east , many of whom apply for asylum after escaping eastern ukraine . 
  as for general population - most could n't care less over here either - overall perception is that we might as well take in 500k rescued from sea - as soon as they receive first monthly stipend of 790pln ( = ~ 190 eur at current exchange rate ) , they 'll be on the bus to berlin or ferry to stockholm anyway ... 
  sigh ... 
  sometimes i miss the days when we were only a transit country for drugs heading west . 
  this is correct . 
  people do n't have any problem with `` our '' tatars . 
  in 2013 someone started fire in mosque in gda\u0144sk and jakub albin of `` national movement '' ( `` ruch narodowy '' ) , right-wing organization said :  our sympathizers joined with help for gda\u0144sk muslims . 
  imam thanked us for that . 
  we do n't perceive tatars as a national minority , but rather as a deeply connected with polish culture ethnic minority . 
  on different occasion , `` m\u0142odzie\u017c wszechpolska '' ( another far-right organization ) , after someone plastered pozna\u0144 mosque with stickers :  we find taking revenge on local muslim communities as harmful and mindless . 
  faith alone does n't qualify anyone to be a potential terrorist endangering our homeland . 
  at this time , one should mention pro-polish attitude of muslim tatars , who earned our respect .
