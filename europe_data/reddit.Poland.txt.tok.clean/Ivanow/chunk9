  mind you , those are far-right organizations , known for `` stop pederasty '' marches and beating gypsies with truncheons and almost lynching them in retaliation to gypsy youth gang attacking poles few days earlier . 
  if even them do n't have any problems with tatar muslims , it speaks miles on how good they are integrated with polish society . 
  * it is enough that the people know there was an election . 
  the people who cast the votes decide nothing . 
  the people who count the votes decide everything .

  i 'm not an expert , but i think that how grainy salt is , depends on how it was obtained - the one from desalting seawater is fine white powder , while the one that comes from mine has much bigger grains and the color is less uniform .

  ^ this . 
  at least in case of polish workers , way more are speaking english than german . 
  also , germany negotiated pretty long `` grace period '' when opening up their job market to newly-joined eu countries . 
  as a result , most ambitious people already left to uk or ireland , as those opened their markets much earlier . 
  same in poland . 
  not sure about now , but before 2008 , we had plenty of ads at unemployment office with laser-tailored requirements and minimum wage . 
  the laws for granting working permit to someone outside of eu required to prove that the company was unable to find suitable worker among local population . 
  one basketball team , who held championship title at that time , put up ad for `` professional basketball player '' in local unemployment office , and i 'm not even joking here . 
  they had to do it before recently-acquired overseas players could be granted athlete visa ... 
   there was only one politian in eu who favored ukraine - carl bildt . 
   it 's in the past . 
  pretty much every party in poland would like ukraine to join eu , provided the requirements are met . 
  for now we 're strongly for association agreement . 
  do n't forget about poland !, 
  polan stronk !, 
  we ** central ** europe now . 
  while i personally do n't support this policy - both on principal ( no matter how you spell it , granting someone or not a safe place to live , only depending on one 's religion is a discrimination , and we should hold ourselves to higher standards than isis who beheads non-believers ) as well on practical ( how do they plan to verify if one is a christian , as he claims to be ? 
  [ fumi-e ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fumi-e ) at arrival to airport ? ... ), 
  reasons , let me explain a bit the current situation in poland and where it might come from ... first of all - our current ruling party just lost presidential vote for re-election last weekend in pretty spectacular fashion ( his rate of aproval nosedived from 70 % not long ago , after a series of scandals connected to po ( civic platform ) ruling and how out-of-touch they seemed to be from everyday situation of their votes . 
  we have parliment elections this autumn and po simply ca n't afford to alienate any of potential voters . 
  this brings us to second point - anti-immigration and anti-islam sentiments have pretty dedicated right-wing sympathizers who often brigade polish social media with `` news '' about latest shitty thing some immigrant did in western europe - if there 's some rape or riot happening there , i guarantee you , it 'll be on front page . 
  recently one of those groups even put up posters at many places in warsaw ( our capital city ) - [ 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wz8dvyl.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fxlun6q.jpg ) ( hashtag means `` poland - i go there '' ) . 
  our country is bordering ukraine and we expect many refugees from there , unless situation improves for them soon - most people seem to agree that if we are to take any refugees , it should be ukrainians , as they are closer culturally to us , than someone from middle east . 
  finally , there 's high unemployment among young people ( who make around 20 % of voters and pretty much make or break a winner in elections ( remember first point i made ? 
  ) , as older generations are pretty cemented in their political sympathies ) , and people both do n't want to see resources spent on helping some random middle-easterns ( no matter how cynical it sounds ) over our own . 
  home users pay plenty of retarded `` additional '' fees that really bloat the price end users are paying - i assume that map is showing `` wholesale '' price . 
  i no longer have gas connection in my house - changed to induction stove , as 2/3rd of my gas bill were those `` additional '' fees ( i have communal heating in my flat , used gas only for stove ) , but here 's [ sample gas bill ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w4z4y9k.jpg ) i pulled from google images ( bit dated , but i do n't think situation changed much ) : - actual usage : 53,92 pln - quality factor ( ? 
  ) : 2,69 pln - network fee : 46,61 pln - transition fee : 7.70 pln - transit fee : 13.40 pln - monthly fee : 6.70 pln total : 131.02 pln, 
  i do n't know much about syrian christians but as soon as they try to stir trouble , they will be sent back on first plane available - we have proud tradition of over 1000 years without religious civil wars and we do n't want to break it anytime soon . 
  nothing wrong about pakistan . 
  knowledge has no borders . 
  the only more vocal group is `` silesia autonomy initiative '' ( ruch autonomii \u015al\u0105ska '' ( silesia is industrial and mining region in south-western region of poland ) , but even them are n't separatists - their program focuses on shifting more power towards local structures . 
  this local movement is pretty fringe even on local scale ( they got around 6-8 % of votes during regional elections ) . 
  yup . 
  `` remis '' means literally `` tie '' - equal number of votes for both candidates . 
  the differences are n't that big that the graph makes it to be - this kind of map pops up everytime there 's election and they use contrasting colors to accent it ( also , orange is po party 's color and blue is pis ' ) . 
  if you were to use the shades/gradient kind of map , the differences would n't be that glaring . 
  usa has blue and red states in the same way . 
  ruling coalition needs 60 % vote to overturn the presidential veto and force him to sign proposed legislation anyway . 
  current coalition ( po + psl ) has 241 out of 460 seats ( ~ 52 % , not enough to overturn presidential veto ), 
  president holds executive power , while parliment has legislative power . 
  president opposing to ruling party might make their life pretty difficult by veto'ing passed bills ( current coalition does n't have big enough majority to overturn the veto ) , but fully cooperative president is bad idea too - if he signs any new law they send to him , without stopping for second thought whether it 's good or bad thing . 
  the system works the best if both parties keep each other in check , without going out of their way to block everything out of spite . 
  definitely it does . 
  big part of those funds goes into road building/upgrades ( i swear , there has been at least 3 concurrent big construction jobs in my town alone ever since we joined eu , which helps transport companies tremendously ( google maps used to show shortest route between cities in silesia and western pomerania going thru germany , and i 'm not even joking here ... ) . 
  many poles are buying properties in eastern germany now , since infrastructure upgrades shortened commute times . 
  many bigger projects are done by international companies from other eu countries ( for example first auction for tram construction gig in my town was won by some spanish consortium ), 
   by the way , programmers in ukraine earn more than programmers in poland for some reason . 
  top-level programmers in poland are employed on contract basis or have self-employed company and send their `` real '' boss invoice once a month . 
  after certain threshold of earnings , taxes and social security payments in poland get really silly - you save a lot of money by this approach - personal income tax past ~ 9000pln is 32 % , while corporate tax is 19 % only , and you can deduce certain expenses , like car , computer etc , from tax base . 
  salary reports usually do n't include those , so the figures you 're getting are mostly from state-owned companies that do n't use such tax optimization . 
  warsaw , poland 's capital . 
  this is ppp graph ( look at label to the left ) . 
  pretty much the only thing much cheaper in ukraine than in poland was gasoline , cigaretes and spirits . 
  if you compare leaflets of major supermarket chains http://www.metro.ua/public/ua_ua/aktii_ta_propozitii/katalogy_ua and http://www.biedronka.pl/pl/gazetki you 'll see that the prices are very similar on many products ( and this is after uah tanked hard since last year - many products used to be cheaper in poland than in ukraine ) . 
  why it is illegal to take photos at the polling station ? 
  i could kinda understand publishing images of filled out cards , as it could be considered agitation , which is prohibited in many countries until polling stations close , but banning taking of all photographs of stations makes no sense to me ... 
  population is basically split into two major camps on the issue - we have `` jan pawe\u0142 does not approve ! '', 
  and mohair berets folks on one side , and `` i do n't care . 
  as long as it makes them happy , let them do it . '', 
  on the other . 
  while it 'd be amusing to see another frenzy and mobilization among the former , decrying `` death culture '' , `` rotten europe '' , and ensuing drama unfolding , referendum itself would be terrible waste of money - referendum alone ca n't change the constitution , which would be required here , so the results would n't be binding in any way . 
  no party or coalition has enough representatives to obtain 2/3 required votes to make such amendment , and stances on this issue for each party are pretty much set in stone , no matter the referendum results . 
  well ... let 's just say that slavic languages are much more `` colorful '' when it comes to cursing , compared to english . 
  due to how polish language works , you can create many words from one `` root '' word , by adding various pre - and - suffixes . 
  i 'll show example of few most common swear-words roots and possible variations . 
  note , that it 's only a tiny part of available words annoyed pole may trow at you . 
  i 'm sure most europeans are already familiar with word '' ** kurwa ** '' by now , so let 's start with this one . 
  literally it means `` whore '' but it 's common usage is more in line with english catch-all `` fuck '' . 
  now , there are few sample conjugations : ** kurwa ** - oh , fuck !, 
  ( if used as standalone expletive ; it can also serve as `` comma '' connecting other parts of sentence ) ** wkurwia\u0107 ** - to annoy , enrage ** wykurwisty ** - awesome , great ** skurwysyn ** - son of a bitch ** kurwiszon ** - woman acting like a bitch ** na kurwie ** - annoyed ( but * wjecha\u0107 na pe\u0142nej kurwie * - * to go all-in * ) another popular curse root-word is '' ** pierdoli\u0107 ** '' - literally to fuck . 
  ** pierdoli\u0107 ** - * to fuck * , but also * to say bullshit * ** spierdoli\u0107 ** - to mess up something badly ** wypierdala\u0107 ** - to make someone get the fuck out ** podpierdala\u0107 ** - * to steal * but also * to rat on someone * ** przypierdoli\u0107 ** - to hit something ** upierdoli\u0107 ** - to get something dirty , to break something off ** rozpierdala\u0107 ** - to destroy ** odpierdoli\u0107 si\u0119 ** - kinda hard to translate . 
  roughly similar to * `` fuck off '' * ** odpierdala\u0107 ** - doing something really stupid/crazy ** opierdala\u0107 si\u0119 ** - doing nothing , lazing around ** napierdoli\u0107 si\u0119 ** - get fucking drunk ** napierdala\u0107 ** - beat someone up repeatadly ** pierdoln\u0105\u0107 ** - hit someone/something ** pierdolony ** - `` catch-all '' adjective to describe something we hate ** pierdolni\u0119ty ** - crazy ** popierdolony ** - stupid , crazy , disliked ** ja pierdol\u0119 !, 
  * ** opierdala\u0107 ** - to chew up someone ( not literally eat . 
  see : seargant chewing up rookies ) ** opierdoli\u0107 ** - to eat something ** wpierdala\u0107 ** - to eat something quickly , to beat up ** wpierdol ** - act of beating something up . 
  ** pierdoli\u0107 si\u0119 ** - * to struggle * , also * to fuck * another popular root-word is ** `` jeba\u0107 '' ** ( again only `` to fuck '' in english ) ** jeba\u0107 ** - * to ignore something * , but also * to stink * ** zjeba\u0107 si\u0119 ** - to fart ** dojeba\u0107 ** - to add something unpleasant ** odjeba\u0107 ** - to become crazy , also to do something stupid ** wyjeba\u0107 ** - to trow something out ** jebni\u0119ty ** - crazy ** wyjebany ** - awesome ** odjebany ** - awesome ** pojebany ** - stupid , disliked ** rozjeba\u0107 ** - to break something ** zajebisty ** - awesome ** mie\u0107 przejebane ** - be in rough situation ** jeba\u0107 si\u0119 ** - to struggle ** zjeba\u0107 ** - to fail miserably now , those are three most popular `` root-words '' from which swear words are constructed . 
  regional usage and translations may vary . 
  there are many other swear words available in polish , but those above seem the most popular . 
  / r/worldnews has surprisingly good discussion on this topic . 
  ( at least at the time of me writing this post . ), 
  top comment ( 3686 upvotes , glided ) :  on average that is then 12500 kroner ( 1907usd or 1675eur ) per person . 
  that is roughly equivalent of 1 monthly payment for persons over 30 years of age or 2 monthly payments for persons under 30 years of age . 
   let me repeat that : on average each of these persons received one or two welfare payments after having left the country . 
  assuming that these people did not announce their departure ( that is , they broke the rules ) i think it seems like a reasonable margin of error for a bureaucracy that has to balance fiscal responsibility and uphold a sense of justice within the system , while maintaining respect for the privacy of ordinary people receiving welfare benefits . 
  poles , uh ... find a way . 
  dunno about meat and diary , but fruits guys are doing great . 
  [ supermarket in doha , qatar ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bijzpmz.jpg ) `` puls biznesu '' ( our national , bloomberg-like , business-focused newspaper ) ran an article about `` freedom apples '' action and it 's consequences - during `` hot period '' right after counter-embargo was announced , domestic consumption of apples rose by 40 % , as measured by supermarkets sales compared to previous year and in following months there was constant 20 % increased demand for both apples and cider . 
  closing of `` easy '' russian market made producents scramble for more `` exotic '' markets , which should be more profitable in long-term ( yesterdays wholesale prices are at 2pln , compared to 0,70 pln from peak of `` crisis '' ) - polish apples are sent as far away as singapore . 
  now the `` hot '' regions our producents are entering into are northern africa and arab penisula countries - one orchard owner notes that `` southerners '' seem to prefer one-color apple types , versus two-color ones we used to export east , but new trees have already been planted and we 're entering in full force in 3 years ... 
  ukraine 's 120eur average wage blows my mind . 
  128 $ is minimum wage of worker in clothes sweatshop in cambodia . 
  it 's not always the case ... take for example `` czerwone maki na monte cassino '' ( `` the red poppies on monte cassino '' ) , famous polish patriotic song , praising sacrifice and of soldiers durring monte casino monastery siege .
