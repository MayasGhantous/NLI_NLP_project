  the bottom of that list is pretty much a contest of how much of their non-eu population is not registered there officially . 
  the list could just as well reflect poor book-keeping by poland , or no incentive to legalize their presence for the immigrants . 
  that , plus it does not mention how big the cities have to be to be included in this list . 
  with smaller cities , i 'm pretty sure it would n't be that hard to find some that have only a local population , in any country . 
  that 's the most russian photo i 've seen in a long time . 
  yeah . 
  this could have been done fair and everybody would be cool . 
  i do n't understand why this was done like this and who exactly profited from this not being done by the book . 
  i mean , any way you look at this , everybody loses in the end . 
  this shit was expensive to everybody , and we 're still hoping it does n't escalate . 
  not really . 
  even if it was protested by not voting or blank votes , it still would n't affect the outcome . 
  that 's a parody of democracy . 
  and i 'm not even touching upon the concerns over vote counting . 
  / / disclaimer i put everywhere when talking about crimea : i would support a popular vote of secession by crimeans , i just do n't think the way it was done at this time was correct and proper . 
  the outcome would still probably be the same , but we would n't be getting our damn panties in a twist about wwiii , and everybody would be less angry . 
  / / edit : actually , i would be cool with russia actually ** buying ** crimea from ukraine . 
  the cost would be probably the same ( or lower ) compared to what russia had to spend on this farce , it would be better for international relations , and the money could maybe be put into lowering ukraine 's debt and improving quality of life instead of pointless posturing and waving guns around . 
  analogy : it 's like saying `` you can choose what 's for lunch : option 1 : we order pizza . 
  option 2 : we go to the pizza restaurant '', 
  maybe if they see how much fun we 're having they 'll decide to join in . 
  you guys actually brought christianity to us , but now you 're too cool to hang out :(, 
  we could get some commonwealth running again . 
  [ something seemed missing , so i fixed it . 
   actually , it is the russian side that is refusing any negociation . 
  to my knowledge they still consider that yanoukovitch is the legitimate president and dont recognize kiev governement . 
  they even refused to meet them in paris when we organised a meeting on the subject . 
  i * kinda * understand why they 're doing that . 
  they keep saying that ukraine/kiev was taken over illegaly by fascists , so they have to `` protect '' crimea . 
  if they agree to meet and talk , it 's like saying `` yeah , you 're the representative of this country '' . 
  if they accept the current government as legitimate , then there is no longer a reason for them to keep `` protecting '' crimea . 
  by sitting down to talks they immediately lose the talks . 
  essentially , the current russian stance is `` there is no legitimate power in ukraine right now , we 're here to keep peace '' . 
  once there * is * legitimate power , there is absolutely no reason to get involved , other than admitting that they 're in fact invading like it 's 1939 . 
  maybe it 's texas that 's invading crimea . 
  i mean , anybody can buy a uniform these days . 
  or holographic gun optics . 
  probably just concerned passerby 's . 
  do n't judge their fashion sense . 
  so ... any redditors got drafted ? 
  should it ? 
  i do n't know . 
  probably , if there is a strong enough separatist movement . 
  however : 1 . 
  this is a really , and i mean really bad moment to consider that stuff . 
  ca n't this possibly wait for official elections , so that the ukrainian side has proper authorities that can properly speak of this issue ? 
  there are democratic and diplomatic ways to establish that . 
  this is something for the ukrainian people to decide . 
  as the russian side would be the one benefiting from such an outcome , i could see crimea being * sold * for a fair price . 
  anything else is a simple land grab . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** i do n't care what ukraine does with its land . 
  they can sell it , give it away , boil it , mash it , put it in a stew . 
  i think russia doing stuff with ukraine 's land is a no-no . 
  yeah , it really looked like a theater , going smoothly according to script . 
  each got a role to do , some lines to say to imitate free will and that 's it . 
  i was watching the live stream from the duma talks . 
  what really got to me was the unanimity . 
  i expected at least one talker to be like `` come on , we ca n't invade foreign countries . '', 
  boy , was i wrong . 
  my thoughts were basically like this :  `` hey , this guy starts talking about human suffering , i think he 's gon na support a peaceful resolution . 
  huh , no , he says to send the army . 
  okay , this guy says about human rights , i 'm sure he 'll say no to the attack . 
  wow , wrong again . 
  hey , this guy says he weeps for his relative that lives in ukraine , probably gon na say it will be bad to have a conflict there . 
  no , the russian army needs to save him . 
  well , i guess i do n't need to watch more , i think i know how the rest goes . '', 
  edit : oh yeah , and one of the deputies saying that `` the states that caused this - france , germany , and poland , need to feel the consequences as well '' made me all warm and happy inside too . 
   is n't that self determination ? 
  it is , but you should probably try and first ask the country that currently holds the territory . 
  it does n't really work in the `` hey putin , we 're totes russia now , roll the tanks here . '', 
  way . 
  so it 's okay to invade an occupy countries so long as you 're not the nazi germany , got it . 
  he still has to sign what the parliament voted in . 
  he has a right to veto . 
  [ with how the last few places on this list look ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/2888295.png ) , i 'd say we 're tied for the last place with a few other countries . 
  well i respect your vote . 
  i do n't really want to express my opinion on whether the swiss made the right choice or not , basically since i simply do n't have enough information . 
  i 'm not swiss , never been to switzerland , maybe their immigration problem is serious enough to cut some agreements with the ue . 
  just wanted to point out that the fact that this was a `` public vote '' does not immediately mean that this was the best course of action for the swiss , or that the ue should somehow be more `` understanding '' , or any other kind of entitlement . 
  there 's been a few people here saying that ue absolutely should not react negatively in any way to this , since it was a public vote and their decision should be respected . 
  the decision is , of course , respected , bit it has consequences as well . 
  ** tl ; dr ** just wanted to stress the fact that it 's still possible to judge a public vote as a good or bad idea . 
  the fact that this was a public vote is irrelevant . 
  vacation in egypt can be often cheaper than vacation at the baltic seaside in poland . 
  i imagine vacationing in germany can get even more expensive . 
   could you explain why it was a mistake if that 's what the country via democracy `` says it wants '' ? 
  public opinion can make mistakes too , you know . 
  imagine it like this : ^ allegory ^ ^ time you have a family of a few people . 
  your family has an agreement with another family , that sometimes they come over for dinner . 
  you also have some other agreements , that maybe you can sometimes borrow some sugar from them , or go watch the game on their tv , or maybe come for the dinner yourself . 
  your family was really fed up with the guests at the table , so they put it up to a vote , and decided that the other family is not allowed to be invited for dinner any more . 
  the other family said `` okay ... you 're not allowed to our dinners as well , and please give back our lawnmower . '', 
  now the members of your family are angry that the other family are such dicks . 
  `` we 've put it up to a vote , it should be fine for us to still go to dinner to them , why ca n't they respect that ?! '', 
  let 's just build this around the equator and get it over with . 
  do n't be silly , of course you can , you just do n't want it * enough * . 
  add to that : * seamless socks made of snakes * seamless bearskin bearsuit, 
  damn , i 'd eat some giraffe . 
  they look so tender .
