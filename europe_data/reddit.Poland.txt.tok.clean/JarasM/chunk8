  it 's hard to figure out the actual reason of criticism for me ( because any accusations of mismanagement of charity money were proved to be false ) , other than to cite wikipedia :  the activity of owsiak is often a subject of criticism from the right . 
  he is often accused of promoting the motto `` r\u00f3bta co chceta '' ( `` do whatever you want '' ) , which can be interpreted as an encouragement to hedonistic lifestyle and moral relativism . 
  a subject of criticism is also owsiak 's approval of some religious associations during woodstock stop ( for example the international society for krishna consciousness ) which , according to some , is a threat for teenagers . 
  wait , we 're excited about eurovision ? 
  i did n't get the memo . 
  apart from fulfilling the criteria , we 're not really in a hurry to introduce euro . 
   oppoistion tried to get rid of the minister of health , but they lost again . 
  that in itself was pretty unexciting , mostly two main parties calling each other names , but i think it 's nice the problem of the long wait times in hospitals is present in the media . 
  i think the state of the polish health care is pretty good and the standards are acceptable , if only one can actually get an appointment , instead of waiting for a decade . 
  as for the news , other things that were `` hot '' this week : * [ infrastructure minister made a bit of a gaffe by saying that `` that 's just the climate we have '' when confronted about huge train delays due to heavy snow ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/159291,new-minister-under-fire-after-travel-chaos-gaffe ) , got a lot of flak for it . 
  i think the dude sums it best : `` you 're not wrong , you 're just an asshole '' . 
  * [ the ongoing issue of a pedophile-murderer being set free after 25 years of jail time ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/158945,freed-paedophile-murderer-will-be-monitored ) , due to his quadruple death sentence being changed to 20 years in jail when executions were abolished . 
  * [ there 's been some discussion about what shape and extent should the polish support to the ukrainian anti-government movements take ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/159495,poland-recommends-prudent-joint-action-against-ukraine-authorities ) . 
  polish authorities ' opinions on the matter are mostly restrained ; some politicians call for even less involvement , while others accuse the ruling party of inaction . 
  people do n't really drink that much bottled water in poland ... [ most of tap water in my city comes from deep wells and the parameters are comparable to bottled water ] ( http://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zwik.lodz.pl%2fjakosc-i-technologia%2flodzka-kranowka%2f&amp;act=url ) . 
  most people in poland do boil tap water first . 
  the reason for that , however , is not bad ground water , but sometimes old pipes in houses , apartments and water supply systems , especially in the rural areas . 
  the problem is mostly blown out of proportion , any reported water contamination is extremely rare , and the tradition of boiling water sometimes makes as much sense today , as koreans refusing to leave fans on for the night . 
   the point is to replace a part of church which does n't deal with spirituality or philosophy but that it provides a center of community and socialization . 
  yeah , just wanted to ask . 
  are n't these just * regular * clubs or something ? 
  do we really need to refer to `` book clubs '' as `` atheist services '' ? 
  that just makes so little sense . 
  if that one mass most people go to on sunday is a `` theist service '' , than everything else they do during the week is pretty much `` atheist '' . 
  ugh , this again . 
  funny thing is - before the church brought this up , the average pole never even heard of `` gender '' . 
  nobody was pushing for any legislation that seriously involved gender ideology , and i did n't hear of a single instance of any kindergarten forcing boys to wear skirts or anything ( which is an often raised argument against `` gender '' , that it happens or is going to happen ) . 
  once this thing started , some tv stations went and started asking people on the street about it , and nobody even had any idea what it is . 
  it 's completely ridiculous , since this is stuff talked about in some sociologist academic circles at best , yet there 's suddenly this `` war '' on it . 
  they might as well declare that the family unit is in danger from nihilism , and that we must fight the nihilists that strike at the good people . 
  or something . 
  also , i do n't really get what 's the deal with `` fighting for the proper families '' . 
  i mean , who the hell cares , and why ? 
  do n't worry , i understand . 
  my mom does n't even drink anything other than black tea . 
  my cousin had a teacup the size of a large bowl ... well , it sort of looked more like a bowl with a handle . 
  i find this to be impractical though , the tea goes cold really fast . 
  man , just reading that made me crave tea , as well as inspired a fondness for bowler hats and queuing . 
   the question was about european union citizenship , not being european . 
  no , the question was about being european . 
  i mean , it 's right there . 
  if it would be about being eu citizenship , then the question is even easier , because there 's a document signed by the british government that makes britain a member state of eu , and its citizens eu citizens . 
  the british are culturally european . 
  they 're also geographically in europe , no matter how much they think that small channel makes them separate . 
  what * else * would they be ? 
  not seeing eye to eye on some issues with other european countries is one thing , but declaring to not be a part of that is as ridiculous as , say , the japanese announcing that they 're special flowers and totally not asian . 
  well , like i said , chicago is not translated , it 's spelled and read exactly like in english , though with a thick slavic accent , 
   is it literally translated to ` new york ' , and y changed to j due to pronunciation ? 
  yes . 
   are all names translated in polish ? 
  no , only some . 
  there 's no set rule . 
  new york is nowy jork , washington is waszyngton , but chicago is still chicago . 
  it 's like ... donald duck and scrooge mcduck . 
  donald might view his uncle as an arrogant , egotistic old fart , but at the same time consider him to be a financially stable , reliable and trustworthy ... duck . 
  please tell me either the photo or that message are geotagged as well , 
  yugoslavians surrounded by germans ? 
  how historical . 
   the poles i know hate russians intensely and do n't care much about germans actually , it 's more common to like russians , but hate russia as a country . 
  which , you know , kind of makes sense , since most russians are really nice people , but the country itself never really could be called being `` friendly '' towards poland . 
   foreign food . 
  i honestly did n't see any other food when i was in england . 
  i even asked on / r/food some time ago about the best english dishes and was told to get some tikka masala . 
  well yes , i 'm not saying it 's possible right now , just that it would be the best option . 
  to remain neutral a country has to be strong enough to not be swayed easily in any direction , which ukraine obviously is not . 
  being neutral is a role i 'd imagine the ukraine would be fit for , if they could afford it . 
  i thought scots just spring out of holes in the ground . 
  i do n't know if it 's better or worse . 
  on one hand we would have our forces torturing people ... and on the other we have allowing completely * foreign * forces do as they please on our territory , treating it like some backwater shithole for torturing people . 
  yeah , sorry , my comment started with a question and went on a tangent . 
  i do n't have the time to read into it right now , and wanted to know what 's this deal actually about and is it as bad as it looks from the headlines . 
   as you just see on this armenia example , the cheaper gas price is probably just a lure . 
  armenia finally get a price reduction , but in exchange for selling its national gas provider company to russia . 
  so that one who will take benefit from this reduction will be ... the russian owned company . 
  hey , if i understand correctly ... in the end , russia will be selling the gas at a reduced price * to its own company * ? 
  armenians might as well not see any difference , since that company might not sell the gas at a reduced price to the armenians themselves . 
  what kind of a deal is that ? 
  who would agree to this ? 
  edit :  by getting these shares russia gains full control of the gas distribution system in armenia , and even if armenia wants to diversify its gas supplies it will have to lay new pipes to get the gas to consumers . 
  seriously , what the fuck . 
   not to re-open any kind of negotiations well , yeah , the negotiations were going on for months prior and were already agreed upon by all parties . 
  re-opening negotiations would be like haggling with a car salesman , agreeing on a price , but instead of coming back with cash , arriving empty-handed saying you changed your mind , only to come back an hour later because your wife yelled at you , but saying you 're gon na haggle more on that price . 
  it 's not a really good analogy , since mexico joining sco would not make a lot of sense other than making a statement to piss off usa , like you said . 
  it 's more like mexico joining a trade and legislative union with some south american countries . 
  such a move might be beneficial for mexico , but lowers usa influence . 
  i 'll try to drink more moldavian wine then . 
  not * something * , [ we sent lem ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lem_\\ ( satelita \\ ) ) !, 
  yeah , seriously . 
  [ swedes once killed 40 % of polish population ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_\\ ( history \\ ) ) . 
  one can find stuff like that about any neighbor . 
  most of europe was in constant war for the last 1000 years . 
  while these comments were made by ` officials ' , they were not made as official statements . 
  however , the silence of any official church channels and lack of any official statements about this is embarrassing as well . 
  my pal `` met '' a jew in england once . 
  he was looking for a room for rent , and got a recommendation to some reputable landlord apparently known as `` gary the jew '' . 
  we thought that `` the jew '' part was a nickname of sorts , so he called the number and asked `` is this gary the jew ? '' . 
  the reply was `` yes , i am a jew . '', 
  no room was rented that day . 
  even if there were , i ca n't imagine wild tomatoes and cucumbers to be very good .
