  because in most slavic languages it more or less means `` water '' . 
  that 's the etymology of the word . 
  i 'd be surprised if we were on this list . 
  a common tactic of our government when dealing with many foreign countries is to pretend everything 's fine and hope the problem goes away and no one will notice . 
  which seems to work fine for our government , since people in poland do n't seem to care about usa spying . 
  the most popular news outlets do n't even report anything about this , the issue is nonexistent . 
  i come for news here . 
   making the rapist obviously a soviet soldier really is confrontational and shows that the artist is trying to make more of a political attack on the soviet invasion than a memorial of those that were tragically raped . 
  of course it is . 
  i mean , that 's the whole point of the sculpture . 
  i do n't see the point in this . 
  if not * every * soldier was a rapist , then does it mean that there can be no depiction of * a soldier * raping a woman ? 
  for many post-soviet and satellite countries cold war kind of ** started ** after the fall of ussr . 
  after 50 years of being `` greatest allies and eternal friends '' , suddenly many countries found themselves bordering their former oppressor , and many atrocities committed by the soviets during the war come to light as it 's finally possible to talk about them openly without fear of being sent off to siberia . 
  current foreign affairs tactics of the russian federation are n't exactly in the `` being kind and friendly '' department , as putin tries to put his country in the dominant position as a superpower that it used to hold . 
  just clarifying for those that may not notice the sarcasm , 
  you mean ` invasion ' . 
  but then you become a prisoner of your desires , abandoning higher ideals for momentary gain !, 
  on the other hand those ideas might shackle you in turn . 
   could n't you argue that you 're less free if your country , nominally sovereign , has values and laws forced on it by foreign countries ? 
  could n't you argue that you 're less free if you do n't follow a foreign treaty only because of principle and to keep the notion of misperceived freedom , while contrary to what you actually wish for ? 
  yeah , i think i 'd actually vote for a party that supports less dependence on usa . 
  i do n't think that 's gon na happen though , our foreign politics in popular opinion is just russia , russia , russia . 
  i 'm actually surprised how stereotypical the american answers are . 
  they 're * statistically * individualistic , self-serving , proud , very religious , intolerant and militaristic . 
  also , man , it 's been a long time since i heard the word `` isolationism '' in the same sentence as usa . 
  i love how a country that involves itself with wars and politics practically all over the world can think of itself as `` isolationist '' . 
  yeah , i think many of belarus ' top officials ca n't even * enter * eu due to sanctions . 
  what would be some typical and common actually * british * dishes ? 
  i 've been to england for over a month once , but apart from some fish and chips joints , i do n't really remember any restaurant advertising british cuisine , only indian , chinese , and so on . 
  what should one eat in the uk to taste that local stuff ? 
  last i heard , bulgaria is a sovereign state . 
  by `` eu leaders jurisdiction '' do you mean `` foreign military intervention , war and a coup '' ? 
   now if only the polish population started being interested in the differences of asian cuisine i might be able to find a place that serves good ph\u1edf i 'm interested , but i do n't really see any asians serving different asian cuisines . 
  i do n't think it 's really an issue with poles , i 'm sure if it was available , people would buy it . 
  people also bitch how poor poland is , but we 're much richer than vietnam ( per capita gdp of poland is $ 21,000 , compared to vietnam 's $ 3,547 ) . 
  no matter how shitty is the pay at those vietnamese bars , i 'm pretty sure they make a lot more than they 'd make at their homeland . 
  i like vietnamese immigrants . 
  they seem peaceful , well-mannered , hard-working , and catch on polish pretty fast . 
  well of course you can cross when there 's no lights . 
  on a crossing you still ( technically ) have the right of way . 
  you have to use a crossing if there is one ( otherwise 50 zloty fine ) . 
  if there 's no crossing you can cross freely , but you do n't have the right of way . 
  and you ca n't cross on multi-lane roads outside of a crossing . 
  i did n't even understand what does your '' ? '', 
  address until i read alltat 's comment . 
  in poland you can get fined 100 zloty for crossing a street on a red light . 
  i * think * i have a checkbook somewhere . 
  i have no idea what to do with it , probably involves visiting a bank . 
  visiting one would also be a first for me ... 
  well i would n't too , i do n't want a ticket ... 
   at the first day of my last job i was 20min too soon ( rush-hour traffic was n't as bad as i thought ) . 
  so i waited 20 minutes in the car so i can be at 8:00 at the foyer . 
  is n't that normal ? 
  i mean , it 's common courtesy . 
  i do n't * hate * the name ( it 's very clever !, 
  ) , but if not for the subreddit we 're in right now , i would have no idea this is not another american movement . 
  then i had to read deeper into it if this is not a uk-only movement . 
  i have never before heard of article 8 - i just have little knowledge about individual articles of the european convention on human rights . 
  i also agree that the american restore the 4th movement as a name worked much better . 
  the american constitution applies to all american citizens , and pretty much every child knows the pledge , the constitution , and the amendments . 
  hell , * we * know some of the amendments . 
  i 'm just concerned that a conversation with an average european about this will look like this :  a : i support the reinst8 movement !, 
   b : reinstate what ? 
   a : article 8 !, 
   b : what article ? 
   a : of the european convention on human rights !, 
   b : that 's nice . 
  what does it say ? 
  edit : it also does n't help that the official website is reinst8.org . ** uk ** . 
  it 's very confusing . 
  we have . eu domains , why not use that ? 
  i think pretty much every one of our countries could use it 's own snowden now . 
  they might get arrested if they get drunk and run around naked . 
  for working for nsa ? 
  unlikely . 
  you 'd have to charge them with something first . 
  as in - a german prosecutor would have to determine that john smith , senior security engineer at nsa ( he 'd have to somehow first find this guy ) had definitive part in doing illegal activities in germany , build a strong case and bring it to court . 
  and i do n't know what the court would do then , since john smith is not a german citizen . 
  maybe they could ask the usa to deport poor john smith , which the usa certainly would not . 
  what would n't happen ? 
  a spontaneous arrest , or john smith not knowing he 's charged with something in germany while going there . 
  oh , sorry , i meant civilized countries , not usa or pakistan , 
  while `` haha law technicalities '' , nobody 's a criminal until they are charged , tried and found guilty . 
  so no , neither nsa guys nor gchq employees are criminals in germany , nor in any other eu country , and they 'll have no problem setting any feet anywhere . 
  did i also mention they 'd have to be charged personally ? 
  you ca n't just charge people based on them being `` nsa guys '' . 
  oh , sorry if in turn it came across that i blame you for the cited opinion , or that i am in any way bothered by it  anyway , reading the captions on other nations in that map , i think the humor is somewhat lost on me . 
  these seem more rude than funny . 
  man , that 's harsh :( [ we 've had uprisings and rebellions - all bloodily repressed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_polish_uprisings#19th_century_and_world_war_i ) . 
  it would be fun , but everyone has to keep in mind that those surveys are absolutely , completely unrepresentative of anything , statistically speaking . 
  maybe one of these counts non-working full-time students as ` unemployed ' ? 
  i have no idea what are the exact procedures , but was the problem only with it being a part of the face ? 
  i did n't ever hear about a prosecutor withholding a finger or an arm - as far as i know , these things always get rushed to the hospital with the patient . 
  sadly , they could n't reattach his original face , because the prosecutor kept it unprotected at the scene of the accident as `` evidence '' for a whole day , [ polish sources say ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwiadomosci.dziennik.pl%2fwydarzenia%2fartykuly%2f428388%2cprzeszczep-twarzy-w-gliwiach-decyzja-prokuratury-utrudnila-prace-lekarzom.html ) . 
  just post-war france i guess . 
  [ `` france , called r\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise in french '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rf ), 
  you know , it 's not exactly * not * true . 
  thanks for the weather info , i guess i 'll have to pack prepared for anything  that 's good to hear - ca n't speak of others , but personally i try not to make a mess . 
  could n't ever understand people with a `` do n't worry about the mess , there are people paid to clean it '' attitude .
