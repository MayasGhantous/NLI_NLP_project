  this is sad . 
  i like how those people seem to be passionate about what they are doing - its amazing to play soldier - but it would be terrible to see them die . 
  and if a conflict takes place - they will die . 
  the only way for organization like that to work is to be completely unaffiliated with a state , focusing not on playing soldier , but on playing guerilla . 
  thats the only way for the baltics . 
  + they have rifles . 
  the rifles are skippable . 
  ( well could be used for defence , but if you have to defend yourself in a guerilla war vs russia , then youre doing something wrong , and are already dead . 
  all they need is is a car and a at , f&f launcher . 
  for example spikes .

  there are two comments under this article that pretty much explain the situation . 
   for a guy with a polish name , twardowski displays an incredible lack of awareness of the situation in poland . 
  here is a wake-up for him -- poland , in an exercise of true democracy , and not eu-dictated idiocy , overwhelmingly rejected the po party in the last elections . 
  the po party , however , refuses to honor the choice of the people and is conducting a partisan-warfare style political confrontation in an attempt to block the new government from doing anything . 
  twardowski needs to stop imbibing eu and po propaganda and come to poland and speak with the ordinary people who were tired of po 's agenda after eight years . 
  the real challenge for the eu is to survive as an institution and abandon its undemocratic ways . 
  and one that is even better  corrupt , arrogant polish leftists cynically spread false hysteria in the western media in the hope that western elites join them in the fight against the social-conservative government and help them to regain power ( and of course money ) . 
  absolutely pathetic and disgusting . 
  but we have shit like this article - not the constitutional tribunal affair , but hateful propaganda pieces like this article are making poland look like some backward shithole . 
  go reread it now , and tell me this does n't read like propaganda . 
  all i can think about now is : reddtor arrested in pyongyang for calling it pingpong, 
  the funniest thing is - without all of the corruption that public procurement is - you guys could ( same as us ) have a very well equipped army . 
  with tons of specialist gear, 
   all the jewish people fleeing from nazi germany to the us without a passport ? 
  denied . 
  great system . 
  exactly this . 
  the jewish people had jewish passports , that would - when asking for asylum - that they are jewish , coming from germany and their identity , including the very important date of birth . 
  statistics say that muslim communities support jihad . 
  they just show outrage for 2 seconds and ask people to not discriminate them bla bla bla , and then back to business, 
  the glorious german efficiency , 
  trolling to be good requires you to be logical . 
  the really good trolls are not obvious , they sound normal , they seem normal , but underneath some sinister plot is taking place . 
  yours is pretty shitty , as after like 20 letters anyone will say kek . 
  so i 've said it has to be logical - so how exactly is taking them in and then killing them easier and simplier than locking them out , and then killing them in their countries , when the chance that your target is muslim is like 97 % ? 
  i do n't understand that too - the eu is the perfect conquest , they are the kings , and they want out ... 
  better to rule with no eu than to be in opposition with eu . 
  i would say that fn is not as bad as its painted . 
  the ** newspapers ** ( pro gov , or with other interests at sake , they ** are for profit ** ) . 
  pretty much any goverment is clueless . 
  these people have really not much of a knowledge of running an actual goverment . 
  its like a business that is 10 times more advanced , and usually the politicians are lawyers , polit . 
  science , doctors ... 
  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/members_of_the_111th_united_states_congress#education this might not directly apply to europe , but it should be really similiar . 
  poles have recently voted in a [ party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukiz%2715 ) of a [ 53 year old ex rock star ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pawe\u0142_kukiz ) . 
  do n't let the far-right shit , speak to you . 
  this is a liberal party with slight conservative ties . 
  its branded right wing , as generally in poland right wing tends to be liberal ( economically , socially often too ) , and left is just left . 
  yes . 
  they have allied with far-right , but only in order to get +5 % votes . 
  wanted to give you an example of a party unfit to rule , but i got carried away ;p tldr ; fn will be as incompetent as currently ruling parties . 
  they simply will have to overcome lack of connections and estabilished brand . 
   does this system work in other war-thorn areas around the globe ? 
  guess the answer  this is one of the things that politicians do with our money that make no sense ( so like 90 % ) - we are paying hundreds of thousands euros for observing nothing . 
  not even the muslims can fix that . 
  terrorists will still be there . 
  just think about the wave of terrorism we will be getting after the isis is defeated - the jihadis will simply go underground or to europe , using links estabilished by current refugees . 
  people are paid to observe from hour x to hour y. 
  they really do n't want to be there , so once their shift ends , they leave . 
  not sure if they even would have protections ( like insurance ) if they had stayed , even 20 mins . 
  also bureaucracy - changing the number of shifts and observers to cover 24/7 ( if we move the observers 5 hours up for example , then the russians will go 12 hours earlier , so they are finished before observers arrive ) takes time , money etc. 
  its a huge decission - concerning dozens of people and departaments . 
  tldr we can do something , but that requires will of the system . 
   not so sure actually . 
  i do know of a case in northern sweden where some `` new friends '' apparently decided the daughter of a a member of the local hunting club was fair game . 
  rumor had it he was stopped on the way out to `` fix '' the problem fully armed . 
  thats personal , thats - while connected - not motivated by supremacism , sense of being in a war or any other vile intentions . 
   point being : at some point people will demand retribution and the current perception of the states unwillingness to `` do something '' is not really helpful . 
  not saying it will be right , but the human condition being what it is , one would have to be a fool to not expect some response soon . 
  it might happen , yore right , but we both know that it would happen as a last cry of some sort . 
   and that is indeed the danger . 
  if the state ca n't uphold its part of the social contract , physical security , people will secure themselves . 
  it 's only a matter of time . 
  so i truly wish the states step up their game ... 
  this is so important . 
  while i think watching a purge would be fascinating - i do n't really think i want to watch one . 
  lets hope that western europe ups their game as you 've said . 
  this is something that we know is happening - but noone can feel that . 
  and so far every time there was a safety assurance - another smack on another cheek, 
  thats true . 
  i have no base to stand on except for my small , limited experience - while you , a belgian man surely have more encounters with french and you might even speak the language  all im saying is that french people will do nothing , because they can do nothing . 
  there might be a few separated incidents , but they will get easily ended by military ( 13k soldiers on the streets ) and police . 
  i have one french friend , pretty reasonable guy from ~ toulouse , and he 's saying that people get pissed off , glued to tv if something happens , but they do n't act . 
  last thing is : i do n't think a french citizen is able to get their hands on a gun . 
  we all know that there are lots of police honeypots and trust involved in illegal markets . 
  what i wa n't to say is that its easier to get guns for 20 yo terrorists from a ghetto , than for a white french dude . 
  fn will win , nothing else will happen . 
  they are harmless lunatics . 
  nothing will happen . 
  maybe one dude doing something breivik style , thats all . 
  so nothing serious . 
  it would take a lot ( like a muslim takeover attempt ) for normal people , for example right-wingers like me to do something . 
  only in self defence . 
  tldr : bs decision in order to be politically correct . 
  exactly this . 
  im trying to explain that here on / r/europe , and im hitting a brick wall . 
  people already know that hurr durr right wing goverment hurr durr dictators hurr durr poland always behind ... its sad . 
  you know they will throw you in the can for that ? 
  you will be bigger news than the terrorist,
