  i assume that russia would start symetrically , and later - after getting huge losses would switch to defensive and asymetrical . 
   population to not be actively hostile to lightly armored vehicles moving along back roads where they are easily ambushed by locals with rpgs . 
  locals have to have the rpg 's first . 
  rpg 's are shit . 
  locals are going to be maybe 2-5k men strong . 
  im generally a person that has a huge hard on for spike sr/mr ( am polish , poland has spikes ) - while expensive , they , unlike rpg 's dont require training , ammo bearers etc. 
  straightforward stuff , 2 mins of training , and any citizen/partisan can knock out a $ 5m tank for 100k usd . 
  thats not counting the crew - crews are more valuable than tanks . 
  thanks to you i will know now  was not aware of that figure of speech previously, 
   except the concordat which is a very formal relationship between the church and state you are right . 
  i should have used a different word like dependance . 
  the concordat is a piece of legislation that guarantees no dependance of one on another , and freedom to practice christianity . 
  obvious stuff generally speaking . 
   practically not all schools organize them not the students problem . 
   if they do they are always in worse hours ( before or after class with free time between them and other lessons ) not at my schools . 
  and even if they did - absence on those lessons would be completely ignored with a parents permission . 
   require more work from the child so what . 
  school is work . 
  work requires effort . 
  if someone does n't want to make an effort - he doesnt have to . 
  i was a pretty good student , but in optional lessons i did nothing . 
  like sitting there with notes consisting just of '' lesson , topic , date '' . 
  if i even were there . 
   not mentioning the ostracism you would face in smaller cities or villages . 
  so im from a smaller city . 
  and ... 
  nothing . 
  thinking that someone cares is very polish . 
  one of the things we just do . 
  but really ... nobody cares , nobody will do anything , nobody will get ostracised , discriminated , degraded for not going to religion lessons . 
  people do n't care . 
  while the war is very unlikely - we can not rule it out  we live in very interesting times , 
   not really . 
  nobody ever thought world war 3 would be easy and americans are well versed in the hypothetical russian threat after decades of dire warnings anyway . 
  plus , simple numbers . 
  i 'd never think the russians are just drunk ivans , i respect the shit out of their power and potential , but they 're at a disadvantage in nearly every facet here . 
  exacly this . 
  i see our views allign pretty much , you just came out as a person that blindly thought that russia could be smashed like iraq ;p the russians are really at a disadvantage , youre right on all points , they will get defeated , but not instantly . 
  i would say ( speculation ) that months or years of war would be needed - insurgencies are still impossible to defeat , and imagine insurgency done by russians ;p, 
  the solutions we currently have would be very discriminatory if applied . 
  they will not be applied , as they will get shot down by being branded facist and totalitarian . 
  tldr time to move to peru, 
  you have overshot with your argument . 
  explain to me ** why would the goverment of sar use chemical weapons against civilians , as they have nothing to gain and everything to loose **  perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the ** syrian army . 
  ** should look like this  ** perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the syrian army . 
  **   i can just easily say that russia planned the paris 2015 attack so france would increase its involvement and help cooperate with russia against forces in syria . 
  my version is probable , your version has a lot of mental gymnastics that involve france turning red . 
   your statement and my example is the very reason why we do n't entertain these stupid conspiracy theories based on no facts . 
  the conspiracies exist because the evidence is unclear . 
  some conspiracies are crazy , yes , but some are `` plausible '' . 
   the syrian government is much worse than the rebels as shown here seeing they 've committed much more mass murders and in greater causality scales than rebel groups have . 
  thats true , if the reports are true . 
  im talking about post war . 
  the only way to not have syria split into a thousand tribes and quasi goverments is to have a strong , central goverment body . 
  currently assad is the only way . 
   dude you are grasping at straws . 
  you are not holding your side of the argument to the same scrutiny . 
  if your argument is that the us would invade syria if it used chemical weapons as a pretext , then its completely flawed . 
  i am not grasping at straws , my explanation is logical and pretty straightforward . 
  + whats the point of sourcing things if its common knowledge ( about the scrutiny part ) . 
  and about the pretext part : someone forgot about the saddams wmd 's , 
  ill tell you one thing : its a clusterfuck . 
  there is a problem and we cant fix it , so people are trying to act like there is no problem , and the ones that have a voice are whitewashing islam and its problems . 
  the baltics would fall , and be later claimed back . 
  its impossible to defend them . 
  something i would like to point out : baltics are literally on the doorstep of russia . 
  its their turf . 
  the other thing russia knows is that baltics are not worth the hassle for nato . 
  while , ofcourse imo , war would be fought - it would be fought in poland , belarus , russia . 
  baltics are simply to easy to encircle and turn into a kettle . 
   our military for the past seventy five years has been built to beat the russian military and europe , and still be able to fight a completely different power in a completely different theater of the world . 
  and russian military for the past seventy five years has been build to beat you . 
  assymetrically , as they can not overpower you in sheer numbers . 
  you would be suprised how hard it would be to win vs russia ( but you , and we ) would win in the end . 
  here is the link that is used by every nato sceptic in the world https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_challenge_2002 tldr : we would win in the end , but with huge casualties . 
  russians are not stupid . 
  they are not the constantly drunk ivan 's, 
   you realize that poland is in europe too right ? 
  you seem to be a kremlin bot by wanting to self warm your own countrys well being . 
  something about me : i love history i love russian people i hate russian goverment i love geopolitics i love defence related topics so , why did you type that ? 
  while i know its an action directed to harm my country and my alliance , i also can stand back and admire how good putin 's offensive foreign policy is . 
  that man is absolutely destroying and dismantling nato , eu and the whole power dynamic of europe . 
  tldr : putin is awesome . 
  maybe hes a bad guy , but hes great at being a bad guy . 
   alright you 're obviously a kremlin bot . 
  you are really subscribing to this ridiculous conspiracy theory ? 
  its not fair that you can dispell any judgements and not hold yourself to your own standards . 
  ** you got lost in the discussion , and now you started to insult me , and paint me in a bad light by cheap `` kremlin bot '' namecalling . 
  stop , go back to normal discussion **  you are really subscribing to this ridiculous conspiracy theory ? 
  yes . 
  it was extremely convenient for fsa and usa . 
  president of us says that chemical weapons are the red line , and conveniently a short while later they are used against civilians . 
  seems like a covert operation to me . 
  ** assad was not stupid , that action would be completely unnecessary , and only damaging the regime , he also knew what happened to saddam **  assad is clearly worse than the rebels , by just looking at the list the syrian government killed more of its people times over than the rebels . 
  those rebels are not moderate . 
  this is a clusterfuck of various groups , with various ideologies and interests . 
  the only thing that them winning will do is turn the conflict from sar vs rebels vs isis vs kurds into group a vs group b vs tribe c vs tribe d , as it has happened lots of times in various countries in africa . 
  only asad 's goverment - in my eyes - can provide peace and prosperity to syria . 
  yes , people will die , they always do , but it will be a magnitude of order less than currently . 
  if there was no arab spring , there would be no refugees , no deaths .
