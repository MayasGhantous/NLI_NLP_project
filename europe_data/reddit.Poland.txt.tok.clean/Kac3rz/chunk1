there 's a world of difference between considering something appalling and inhumane , while expressing the inability to change it , and only considering the particular methods inhumane , while mostly condoning the reasons behind those actions . 
  if someone thinks that maybe charlie hebdo cartoonists should n't be murdered the way they were , ** but ** they had it coming and the values that pushed the terrorists to act are right , only the execution was wrong , that person has no right to call themselves * moderate * muslim . 
  this * `` but '' * works the same way it works the classic phrase * `` i 'm not racist , but ... '' * -- it nullifies anything said before the word * `` but '' * . 
  i have a constant feeling that many think * `` moderate muslim '' * means * `` a muslim , who is quite moderate in their views , compared to what many other muslims believe '' * . 
  it 's wrong . 
  what it should mean ( unless we split the term and find a new one ) * `` a person , whose world view is moderate enough to be compatible with western values , who happens to be a muslim '' * . 
   probable scenario : it 's mostly funded by eu money ( which comes from all of us ) nothing happens , really . 
  life goes on . 
  another proof you know nothing about eastern europe . 
  nobody here will just wave their hand and say it does n't matter , it 's * mostly * funded by the eu ( which is very far from being sure right now ) and most definitely nobody here will have the approach * `` everybody 's paying , so it 's cool '' * . 
  dude , people in poland ( and we 're not talking some fringe political pundits , but big , legitimate political forces ) are still of an opinion , joining eu and the benefits it brings is not some great privilege bestowed upon us by the merciful europe , but a long due payment for selling us out in yalta and potsdam . 
  this is a sentiment that will not go away and no politician , polish or from other eu country , can try to ignore it without consequences . 
  we can accept refugees , no problem since they 'll run away to germany the second they have a chance to and there 's no way to stop them . 
  that would require force and keeping them locked . 
  germany ( and netherlands too ) would shit themselves over the perspective of such a * nazi like * treatment of the poor refugees . 
  we will take them , but on the conditions that will not even * remotely * resemble the standards western europe imagines refugees should be treated with . 
  either that , or no refugees at all . 
   the reason why i 'm not panicking ( at all ) is because we ( as europe ) have weathered much much worse storms than this . 
  not the part of europe we 're talking about here . 
  we had our own problems and they 're far from over . 
  the specifics of the region are completely different from germany or netherlands . 
  from economical to cultural ones . 
  but you do have a point , that this seems how western europe seems to look at things -- * `` we did it one way one time , so now everybody will do this our way too . 
  '' * this is not gon na fly . 
   many eastern european leaders already have unilaterally said `` no , you solve it '' or rather are doing what 's in their capacity , which is completely different from what germany et consortes imagine in their myopic worldview . 
  as i 've said once before -- germany is acting like a guy who goes to the bar with his friends and is convinced they will be ordering the same expensive drinks and lap dances from strippers , he does . 
  when the friends do n't want to , he accuses them of being a buzzkill and not good friends anyway . 
   these people are not going anywhere , as they have a right to request asylum in most european nations . 
  first of all , they only have right to asylum in the * first * nation they reach , that is not a war zone . 
  they do n't get to choose , and yet they do and will continue to , because germany could n't imagine people do n't act as it is expected from them . 
  surprise , surprise . 
  angela unilaterally breaking the dublin regulation made that a problem of germany . 
  i do n't see , how it 's news . 
  contrary to what you and some politicians claim , eastern european leaders are open to dialogue , as long as as there are any propositions and conditions that are grounded in reality those countries exist in . 
  and not some feel good fairy tale berlin believe they live in and expect everyone to . 
  so i 'd advise to tune down on the smugness and self-righteousness . 
  even the dalaj lama understands , europe ca n't take all the refugees . 
  angela 's soft heart means shit . 
  breaking agreements to let * more * refugees will quickly backfire and result in countries breaking the international law to accept them * less and less * . 
  this is exactly , what is going to happen , whether some sobs on the eu political scene will ( unsuccessfully ) try to scare everyone into submission , or not . 
  in conclusion -- until the eu is ready to accept that * maybe * , just * maybe * the reality of the refugee crisis is to what budapest or prague describe and much less what berlin , stockholm , amsterdam or vienna believe in , there will be no dialogue . 
  not to mention , the discussion on * `` how to make sure plans written in berlin are realized all over europe '' * is not dialogue . 
   they get food , they get clothing and a roof over their head . 
  but nothing more . 
  it 's almost cute , how detached from reality western europeans are . 
  what you described is what they will get here in poland and other countries of the region ** even if they will be here legally ** . 
  why would they stay here ? 
  unless germany and other countries of the old eu plan to direct some new and additional funds * specifically * aimed for the refugees , they will get nothing more than the ( poorly heated ) roof over their heads and spam sandwiches twice a day . 
  unemployment is high even for the locals , if refugees miraculously get a job the median pay is laughable compared to the western europe , the social net is ** much ** smaller both in number of services offered and the amount of money they provide . 
  and if our government directed some special ( even if not large in absolute numbers ) part of our country budget towards the refugees or created some special forms of welfare , even if just for those 12.000 that is the stated number ... well , it would n't be pretty . 
  best case scenario -- political suicide for the ruling party ; worst case scenario -- riots and refugees being treated as outright enemies by the * very * large and disenfranchised part of the population , convinced ( and quite rightfully so ) this money should first go to them . 
  western europe does n't seem to understand that we here , in the east , have a significant economic delay compared to them , even when taking all the economic growth after the fall of the eastern bloc taken , into account . 
  we 'll take the refugees and provide them with a decent welfare , no problem ... 
  call us in 30 years . 
  and refugees know very well all that i 've written above and will everything they can to reach places they consider beneficial for them . 
  and the ( projected ) million of refugees can do * a lot * and are almost impossible to control . 
  and , to add to your comment , you simply * can not * offer the refugees better welfare than the the country is offering its own citizens . 
  people in western europe , whose parents and sometimes even grandparents lived in prosperity , may have a problem with understanding that offering refugees better social nets than the natives have at their disposition in our countries ( the ones east of berlin wall ) , is at best a political suicide for the political party doing that . 
  worst ( and very probable ) case scenario -- massive riots and the refugees being treated as outright * enemies * of the locals convinced they 're taking the funds that should go to the natives . 
   the wealth must be redistributed . 
  and it is -- through taxes and social welfare . 
  any more invasive or more global form of wealth distribution inevitably ends with bloodshed and oppression . 
  which is exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to achieve . 
  communism does n't work and never will . 
  basically , germany is acting like that guy who goes with his friends to a bar and orders the most expensive drinks assuming , that since he 's ready and willing to pay for them , everyone who 's with him has the same approach and the same idea how to party , so they are supposed to order them too . 
  not really . 
  one can comment on reddit with total disregard for opinions of other redditors . 
  it 's even easier since res introduced the * disable inbox replies * function . 
   to ultimately reach germany that 's the crux of the problem , though . 
  they do n't get to choose to travel to germany . 
  as refugees they must accept shelter in the first peaceful country they arrive to . 
  there are no assad 's barrel bombs in hungary . 
  case closed . 
   aka artificially made up reason for humans not to move freely across land and the concept of everyone moving freely across the land is a pipe dream that will never come to life without restrictions . 
  so any discussion about asylum seekers and other immigrants simply has no room for idealistic and unrealistic views on the matter of borders etc. 
  if islam is understood as an ideology , what is wrong in being anti-islam ? 
  every ideology should be prepared to meet a ( hopefully constructive ) criticism . 
  every downvote = brigading . 
  of course . 
  rather than maybe a large group of users disagreeing ... 
  good . 
  the more targets of the sanctions , the better . 
   i am confident that signing this thread would get less support from / r/serbia community than staying neutral . 
  i wonder why ... 
   presumption of innocence is so fucking pass\u00e9 , amirite ? 
  it 's alive and well ... 
  in the court of law , where it applies . 
   the entire continent of europe has become pacifistic and peaceful that only means it would have a hard time defending itself from an invasion ... 
   maybe the gloomy cunt feels the need to consolidate his power in russia even more ? 
  nobody really knows how strong is putin 's hold on power . 
  everyone seems to forget , that he did n't just come out of nowhere and took the power from yeltzin . 
  putin was * assigned * by the same people , who forced yeltzin to step down . 
  of course it 's possible , vladimir already took care of the people who brought him to power and remained the only one on this internal russian battlefield with absolutely no group to challenge him ever , but i would be surprised if that was the case . 
   if you do n't like a goverment the most democratic way of changing it is assaulting the parliament sometimes it is . 
  like , when the government wants to effectively ban demonstrations . 
  which , interestingly , is exactly what happened in ukraine and escalated maidan which ended with ousting yanukovych . 
  i wonder if spain is going the same route ... 
   do you want people to take photos of you while you work and post them to god knows where with god knows what comments attached ? 
  when you 're a public servant you should n't have a say in that matter . 
  a public servant ** while performing their duty ** has no right to privacy .
