  i 'm not even touching the * `` b-but the security '' * bullshit argument . 
  your logic on the other hand is based on a delusional notion that germans ( because let 's be honest , that 's what we 're talking here ) have any right to `` discipline '' those eu countries that do n't agree with angela 's view on the immigrant crisis . 
  germany does n't have that right and will be painfully reminded of this fact if they try to act , like they do . 
  eu can fall apart any minute and i 'm sure germans would act all betrayed and disappointed if it does due to the german arrogance . 
  then those countries have every right to tell the eu to fuck off , since nobody in their right mind wants to participate in a deal they have no impact on . 
  and i admit i was n't replying exactly to what you wrote . 
  but the things is it should n't be relevant , what is normal among muslims in norway . 
  if it undermines the very principles of a modern society , it should be actively combated . 
  that 's it . 
   then you do n't understand the meaning of the word normal . 
  no , it 's you who does n't understand the meaning of that word . 
  when applied to societies it means according to the norms present in the particular society . 
  in other words , it does n't matter what 's normal for muslims living in norway . 
  the only thing that matters , is what 's normal for norwegians . 
  the flawed line of reasoning you present is responsible for the fact that the expression * `` moderate muslim '' * ca n't really be used in a discussion , because for some it means * `` a muslim who 's not as radical as other muslims '' * , which gives you no information , while , to be relevant , it should mean * '' a person , who is a muslim and respects the standards of the western societies . 
  and i 'm saying that the * `` socioeconomic circumstances create muslim terrorists '' * reasoning is wrong and time and time again it has been proven it 's simply not the case . 
  but , since we disagree on the very basics , there 's no point in arguing any further . 
  i see you 're the * `` it 's the western society 's fault muslims radicalize '' * type of person . 
  hate to break it to you , but that 's a completely bankrupt narrative and nobody listens to it anymore . 
  we 're done with that line of thinking . 
  and yet the thread is upvoted and here you are bitching about the evil `` right wingers '' on / r/europe being a worse threat than islamists , who actually murder people . 
  i wonder what people like you think of people like me - against the very right wing , nationalistic and pro-catholic government that was elected not so long ago in my country at the same time considering islam ( not just muslim terrorists ) being a threat to europe . 
  things are already * worse * . 
  burying heads in the sand is the worst solution . 
  much worse than any action that leads to `` alienating '' muslims . 
  and maybe you should start to worry - with the ongoing trends in europe * `` people like me '' * will be in charge soon enough . 
  you 'll see . 
  considering how the terrorists from brussels and those from paris were apparently * well known * to the belgian special services and still it amounted to nothing . 
  add to that what americans said about their cooperation ( or rather lack of thereof ) with belgians it seems that the answer to your question is : * because apparently belgian special services are a joke * . 
  remember , we 're talking about a country that was n't able form a government for what , year and a half ? 
  well , pandering to them did n't work either . 
  ever heard of * reductio ad absurdum * ? 
  get your shit together , if you want to discuss things on any serious level . 
   last time i checked sweden had a police force responsible for reacting to incidents such as the one described last time * i * checked , swedish police admitted themselves they 're more and more unable to deal with the incidents caused by the immigrants . 
  the evidence to support the claims that immigrants from me are causing much more problems that should be allowed in the middle of europe are all around you . 
  you admit it yourself saying that you read about crimes perpetuated by the scum from me * every day * . 
  and yet you 'd rather shit yourself than admit a few simple facts . 
  people like you are beyond intellectual redemption . 
  we 're done here , since you would never admit the facts you dislike . 
  as i said though , thankfully people like you are losing ground every day , with each example of the failed immigration policy of the eu coming to light and soon will just be a loud minority not treated seriously by anybody . 
   media reports or crime reports do n't count . 
  of course they do not count , because they undermine the narrative of people like you . 
  the fact that it 's very hard to conduct thorough research because of the fact that because we 're talking about things that are * currently happening * is enough for your kind to write every concern off as an example of bias , * `` bigotry '' * , * `` racism '' * and * `` xenophobia '' * . 
  as i said - pathetic . 
  sadly people like you ca n't be ignored , because they do everything to control the narrative . 
  it is changing though . 
  thankfully . 
  yes , of course . 
  everything is a singular incident , even when the trends are staring you right in the face . 
  people like you are so pathetic it 's not even funny anymore . 
  especially because the rest of us have to pay the price for your delusions . 
   every day i come on here and read about another isolated incident i suppose you fail to see the irony of that statement ... 
   as said the biggest concern for me is when they catch these chaps that they deport them . 
  and i said that catching them is unlikely and their deportation has been painted by the officials as a very remote possibility . 
  there were voices of the german officials on how the perpetrators may * even * be deported . 
  as if it was some special punishment rather the absolutely basic thing to do . 
  so i 'd say there 's a 80 % possibility that the perpetrators of the sexual assaults on nye will ** not ** be apprehended and punished . 
  i wonder if that will be enough for you and people like you to admit there 's a large scale problem , or will they still think nothing special is happening and go by the mantra * `` treat everything on a case by case basis '' * , even in the face of the obvious trends . 
  btw , no poland is not literally stalinist east germany because of pis , but yes , democracy in poland * is * threatened in the face of their autocratic political actions . 
   the problem will come if enforcement is n't executed properly in the wake of these attacks . 
  * various european police agencies are unable to capture the one remaining attacker from paris and were unable to anticipate the events and stop the terrorists responsible for this attack and charlie hebdo even though they were known to the police . 
  * the attempts to sweep the cologne attacks under a rug are ** a confirmed fact ** , even the policemen are talking about their inability to control the situation on nye and and the incompetence of their superiors . 
  no charges have been brought against anyone responsible for the sexual assaults so far and only a fool can believe there will be any . 
  etc. , etc. . . 
  so , i do n't understand the future tense in your comment . 
  apparently , the conspiracy theorists had it backwards - all the european police and intelligence agencies are not almighty and gathering information on everyone and everything ; rather they know shit and can do shit . 
   it 'll just be a slightly flawed capitalist economy where most people are too busy working to be starting a civil war over seeing someone in a hijab down the local supermarket so the answer is to close your eyes and keep working even with terrorists attacks , rapes and such , so there is no danger to the fragile economic state from the sociological direction . 
  how sad and pathetic ... 
   marginalization is like fertilizer for that kind of stuff . 
  look at where the french attackers came from . 
  that 's what i do n't get about all the hatred i see on this subreddit . 
  ah yes , the good old * `` society is responsible for the terrorists and criminals that attack this society '' * mantra , the left side side of political spectrum repeats ad nauseam which causes them to be taken less and less seriously . 
   event of organised crime and backwards/dangerous worldviews doesnt justify sending back all refugees yes , it does because it shows that accepting them has more cons than pros . 
  case closed . 
  but wait , you would disagree on the basis of * `` values and principles '' * would n't you ? 
  and that 's how we reach an impasse and any further discussion is impossible . 
   he was talking about how its disgusting to send vulnerable war refugees back into the battlefield out of irrational fears of european nationalists yes , he was , you are and many other too . 
  which shows you are a group of people driven by emotions and either unwilling or unable to look at the situation objectively , considering all the pros and cons of the current situation . 
  all you see is what you would probably call * `` european values '' * which in reality is just a myopic and infantile worldview that can have outright suicidal consequences . 
  basically you 're all a bunch of people who cried along with this girl talking to merkel in that tv show , thinking that 's how the world looks and now are angry others do n't look at the situation through your rose-tinted glasses and you 're only capable of thinking of the constantly growing number of those who want to realistically look at the outcomes of the mass immigration as * `` disgusting '' * . 
  this all means that people thinking like you , including politicians are being taken less and less seriously . 
  the problem is , that this kind of childish , emotional redditors and such can simply be ignored , but politicians hold the actual power thanks to which they can fuck eu over for years to come due to their short-sighted reactions . 
   what he said was disgusting . 
  ah yes , deporting people from a country and stopping mass immigration ( both being simply aspects of sovereignty ) is * `` disgusting '' * nowadays . 
  that 's the new level of stupid and pathetic . 
  it 's not about what they should do . 
  it 's about answering the question whether they actions have any positive impact . 
  if the answer is * `` there is no influence of ai 's activity on the behaviour of the north korean regime '' * , then amnesty international can not really claim they 're * fighting * for the cause of human rights in north korea . 
  what they 're * `` deeply concerned for '' * , * `` raise awareness about '' * etc. 
  is absolutely irrelevant and a waste of time , being just a form of mental masturbation . 
  i wonder , what is the credible source for that , opften repeated , statement ? 
  care to provide any ? 
   this is what they want . 
  if we force them back to their war ravaged lands they will certainly not look kindly toward us which is something the is will use as a recruitment weapon . 
  anything to back it up , or is this just how you * feel * or are * certain * it has to be that way ... because reasons ? 
  the narrative that first al-qaeda and now isis is actively trying to shift the attitude towards muslims to make them join their side has never been proven and does n't exist aside from one of bin laden 's statements . 
  right . 
  more godwin law and appeal to emotions . 
  now * that * will make a serious discussion possible . 
  you 're as bad at this as those you criticize and you do n't even see it through your ideological glasses .
