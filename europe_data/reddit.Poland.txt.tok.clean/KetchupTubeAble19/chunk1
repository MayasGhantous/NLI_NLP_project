well , the industrial train lines are on hold even longer . 
  * `` no , no , we 're just getting back austria and czechoslovakia , nothing else planned , do n't worry . 
  obviously my point was when people talk about war , hear about war or demand troops to be sent here and there , that they obviously have no idea what the consequences of their demands are on the battlefields . 
  news are abstracting things and make things feel further away , you do n't get * as close * as you do when seeing pictures like the ones here . 
  true , yet ( at least i read about it ) mlrs systems are one of the most successful weapons deployed by the rebels . 
  i guess all the burn out tanks dont necessarily have been destroyed by them , as you say . 
  sorry about my misleading post , 
  does n't that depend on the type of ammunition used ? 
  apparently , rebels are pretty successfull with [ things like these ] ( http://zippy.gfycat.com/shabbyorangegrayfox.webm ), 
  [ mlrs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_rocket_launcher ), 
  well you read the news and it says `` clashes in eastern ukraine '' , yet you have no idea what it actually means . 
  this goes for non-stupid people as well . 
  / u/binaryhashcake is right . 
  i read about it as well . 
  110 also looks more like they got killed by other things if you look at the corpses . 
  what does that mean ? 
  well , war , for most europeans , even today and even in former yugoslavia is something that is considered to happen far away , but not inside our continent anymore . 
  pretty nice office location , btw . . 
  autumn is autumn , is n't it ? 
  and yes , not lithuanian , found these pictures from a lithuanian friend though , 
  hm , i live far south , so maybe that 's why we have it and you do n't . . 
  hm , we also have it in kaufland and edeka , do n't you ? 
  yes , i like it as well , apologies , 
  well , brandless cheese from locals is the best , but maybe try [ appenzeller ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appenzeller_cheese ) ( that 's the only one that comes to mind at the moment ) . 
  pick surchoix or extra . 
  proper swiss/austrian mountain cheese . 
  i hate that flavorless stuff they sell as `` cheese '' in supermarkets nowadays . 
  amen . 
  - german corporal of the paratroopers called in sick for 2 weeks - after that , he did not return and was missing alongside with his combat equipment ( no arms though ) - born in the former soviet union in 1991 , according to whatsapp contacts , he is already fighting in eastern ukraine - paratroopers are very well-trained and well equipped . 
  he has been a member for two years , with two years of service remaining, 
  any place where you can watch it apart from tv ? 
  some tv station 's website ? 
  does anyone know ? 
  great review man !, 
  i was wondering , thank you !, 
  usually the country of birth/residence . 
  i have a friend ( german ) who has a girlfriend ( finland ) . 
  they talk english with each other . 
  now they have a baby and live in denmark . 
  no idea how that 's gon na work language wise . 
  because of this , there are approx . 
  1 million erasmus babies, 
  ha , right :d cheers . 
  ** germany ** in school , we covered nazism very very extensively . 
  including holocaust , how hitler came to power ( these two extensively ) , general life , course of events , the whole deal . 
  it disturbed me that we did not really discuss the actual war that much . 
  it was just `` well , poland , then this and then that stalingrad and then d-day and then over , gg '' . 
  not really suitable to teach the young germans what this war actually meant in terms of size and brutality . 
  another thing with emphasis was reunification and frg-gdr history . 
  i am yet to find a contemporary danish production that does n't :d they are great actors , so i guess it 's fine . 
  small country , few actors , great cinema . 
  i am always on time . 
  always . 
  ^ ( i guess my friends who are always late are no true germans ), 
  ha , of course the german puts his money into his piggy bank . 
  the occasional ? 
  morroco - got ta save the last peacful country of the arab and it 's cultural gems . 
  haha , i agree . 
  i thought about putting it in '' '' but i just went with the original title of the article without altering it because the guidelines say not to editoralize the headline when posting a news article . 
  surely this was intentionally made like that to make it easier for them / s, 
  he 'll land some mil-mi8 's in a polish field then !, 
  so , belgium ? 
  tell us . . 
  yes !, 
  bodensee / lake constance has everything you need . 
  ( i know , because i live there . 
  no bias whatsoever ) . 
  mountains , lake , decent cities , three countries , sailing , hiking , biking , flying , skiing , history , castles , modern architecture , nightlife , food . 
  stuttgart ** is not worth visiting ** . 
  museum and zoo are cool though . 
  best hiking destinations in germany : the alps . 
  saxon switzerland is also nice . 
  cool - now give us a ** new survey ** !, 
  deutschlandfunk and dradio wissen are superb . 
  i 'd like to add the austrian/english station [ fm4 ] ( http://fm4.orf.at/ ) . 
  great music , bilingual and most certainly on a whole other level compared to all the trashy local station . 
  empire of germany approves . 
  yes pleaase !, 
  looked like [ this ] ( http://images.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-09/wuppertal-salafisten-3/wuppertal-salafisten-3-540x304.jpg ) . 
  here 's a video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmqf0iudhyo happened in wuppertal , germany . 
  police will monitor future gatherings , however , it is totally legal and no problem to advise young people not to drink or not to go to the club . 
  but the monopoly of force is with the state , behaviour that provokes , threatens or intimidates will not be tolerated , said the police president . 
  ( but the answer to the attacks must be more democracy and more openness . 
  otherwise , those who were behind them will have achieved their goals . ), 
  `` reconquer the streets , the markets - the public spaces , with the same message of opposition : we are devastated , but we will not give up . 
  with torches and roses , we deliver this message to the world : we do not let fear break us . 
  and we do not let the fear of fear silence us . '', 
  `` evil can kill a person , but never conquer a nation . '', 
  - stoltenberg after the utoya attacks . 
  is that allowed ? 
  how are they equipped ? 
  are they institutionalized in any form ? 
  any overwatch ? 
  or is it just 20.000 people under arms without any constitutional control ? 
  feels weird  / / nevermind , looked it up in wikipedia . 
  thank you for the reply , ivar, 
  what is the estonian defence league ? 
  [ article - fr , lib\u00e9ration ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/monde/2014/08/25/libye-170-corps-de-migrants-africains-retrouves_1086938 ) it 's french though  posted it as first comment , sorry it got buried, 
  yes it is unfortunate . 
  i had hoped this thread would go other ways given the drastic image .
