  yes !, 
  we will use reddit to browse the internet from now on . . oh wait . 
  it works for my sister in germany . 
  english : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhafgcpexes youtube livestream . 
  what , this is not working ? 
  sounds like satirical movement ? 
  in germany , we have a satirical party . 
  they are against european norm-penises . 
  media coverage has been ridiculously low . 
  almost all eu institutions and parties have tweeted this today . 
  but major ( german ) media did not publish about it . 
  it will hopefully be on youtube and get a couple more views . 
  that moment you realize your english is better than that of schulz and juncker . 
  rusty start , yes . 
  but : they do n't have these stupid second-counting things . 
  the candidates seem to speak quite freely and not as if they knew all the questions beforehand . 
  and now they can even challenge each other . 
  what campaign is this ? 
  i made a new thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/246r42/lack_of_euelection_coverage_in_your_country/, 
  it 's on a small channel ( a daughter of ard/zdf ) that has like 1,8 % market share . 
  i generally find the german media coverage of the election heavily lacking . 
  everything that made the news last week was berlusconi raging and that is about it . 
  no information on parties , candidates etc. 
  you have to go out and find it all yourself . 
  more relaxed and laid back , but also very hard working and efficient ( work + hygge = profit ) . 
  a reserved attitude whereever you meet new danes , but very open and interested when you get to know them ( or when they are drunk ) . 
  when you walk , shop or cycle around , you are not being bothered and everyone tends to mind their own business in public most of the time , which i find relaxing . 
  ( but still very helpful : first time i got on the bus , the klippekort-machine did not work properly , 5 danes instantly got up and wanted to help , seeing i had just arrived with my big suitcase . 
  one of them just slapped the machine a couple of times and it worked like a charm . ), 
  of course it is utter bollocks to generalize this to a general view of ` the danes ' vs. ` the germans ' , but thats how it feels to me . 
  no alcohol for the poor !, 
  the danes are much less environmentally caring than i thought they 'd be ( on individual level ) . 
  there is no real waste separation and if you look next to streets , there is quite a lot of trash in the nature . 
  pretty sad . 
  isnt ' that the opposite of what baiersmannbaiersdorf meant ? 
  we should become like you , not you become like us  i live in dk at the moment , and apart from the people 's hearts and minds , the differences are not too big imo . 
  when someone is behind me , i tend to hold open the door for both males and females . 
  does that make me bisexual ? 
  so much this . 
  it 's such a shame that this is not broadcasted on national television stations . 
  but this time `` anschluss '' in regards to the german role of being the electricians of europe ( like the polish plumbers ) . 
  not gon na happen . 
  ca n't blame you . 
  i learned that many of my european/german friends do n't know too much on even european geography . 
  back in highschool , a friend of mine put the republic of congo where poland is in reality . 
  and she was serious about it . 
  haha , you 're funny :d, 
  cheers !, 
  i was ready to hop on the ` americans do n't know geography ' bandwagon . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  * the town i live in in germany killed jan hus . 
  [ memorial ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/hus_pam%c3%a1tn%c3%adk.jpg ) . 
  thats why we have pretty close ties to czech cities and people . 
  i was in ceske budejovice , cesky krumlov , tabor and praha - all of them pretty nice . 
  ( sry for wrong spelling ) . 
  * awesome beer * they put jam on caraway bread * when crossing the german/cz border , there are tons of cheap asian shops and lots of brothels where you can find lots of mercedeces owned by conservative bavarian married men . 
  ( edit : apparently , not anymore ) the actual czech girls are really nice and beautiful . 
  * they quite openly hate gypsies, 
  ca n't believe you get downvoted for this . 
  thank you . 
  as german , i felt the same way . 
  scary as fuck , same goes with most of the comments in here . 
  i am living in denmark atm and learning the language . 
  i was on a train lately and a bunch of swedes sat near me . 
  i understood a lot more of what they said than i understood the danish people 's chatter in the train . 
  even the different classes in my danish school teach stuff different from each other :d it 's challenging , but i love danish . 
  do you have any sources on that  it teaches that you do n't need to care about the ones outside of it , that you can steal from them , beat them up ... 
  germany : make a fake-contest . 
  the worst contestant wins . 
  in esc night , complain about eastern-european voting block . 
  there is some kind of tv-show i guess , but i never watched it : [ wiki-sverige ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyskland_i_eurovision_song_contest_2013 ) here are some interesting facts about the song requirements : - singer must be at least 16 yrs old - max . 
  6 people on stage at a time - singing is live , music must be playback . 
  - no political message or message that could damage the image of esc - max 3 mins, 
  so tasty . 
  it 's like me saying , get all the austrians , put the males into prison spread them all over the place or deport them into some third world country , take their kids away and teach them our own ideology . 
  you ca n't just dismantle a whole culture just to get rid of some criminals . 
  i also think that most of the people here tend to put all the roma into one box . 
  x-post from another video posted here : there are more of those videos , it 's a challenge by a german youth media organization that wants to bring politics to young people : [ germany : `` how i met your mother - europe style '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lwcn7qmvy4 ) [ ireland : `` packing '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg9jmttak6q ) [ belgium : `` les etoiles magiques ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhxqp4o4fj4 ) [ austria : chocolate cake with maonnaise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=girle2myxgg ) [ greece : o.m.g. !, 
  oh my god ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uid2uxn1rhm ) the greece , belgian and ireland ones are quite well-done imo .

  good point . 
  but just a tiny bit more on direct democracy could do well for the german system . 
  i live next to the swiss border and yes - it has its downsides , but there are lots of good things about it aswell . 
  ( hence the `` swiss ( ish ) '' ) . 
  oh , that surprises me . 
  but further east should be significantly cheaper compared to germany i recon ? 
  in eastern germany maybe . 
  and yes , i am naive . 
  diplomacy , fuck yeah . 
  not gon na happen . 
  seriously . 
  * scandinavian welfare * danish cycling infrastructure * eastern european price level * italian/french food quality * english humour * old towns and villages that have not been destroyed in the war * baltic internet infrastructure ( ? ), 
  * swiss ( ish ) democracy, 
  this !, 
  i feel almost like an english speaker here in denmark . 
  i feel like everyone understands me when i speak german . 
  when i want to gossip i have to use weird german dialects that danes do n't understand :d, 
  there are english subs to the video . 
  exactly , that is the problem :d,
