  used by women all over the world :d, 
  the civil flag of west berlin was adopted on 26 may 1954 . 
  designed by ottfried neubecker , it came in second in the contest of 1952 , the winner being rejected by the senate . 
  the emblem of the bear is apparently a pun on the city 's name ( b\u00e4r meaning bear ) . 
  i have no idea why it is not in the middle , but i like it . 
  i would really love to see a reduction of the incredibly high farmer subsidies . 
  i would really hate to see american agricultural products flood our markets when it is completely unnecessary to transport the stuff you can grow on both sides of the pond . 
  it 's the same with apples from new zealand , fruit from china and beef from argentina . 
  completely ridiculous . 
  as a southern-german , i align myself with the food of austria and switzerland , which is infinetly superior to the food you get in northern germany .

  i 'd rather have sanctions on the whole government elite , all the oligarchs and media barons . 
  ban them from travelling , freeze their accounts , stop talking to them etcetc  but ofc , this wo n't happen and normal russian citizen has to pay and russian propaganda will tell him that he has to blame eu and not putin and the whole thing goes up the wrong way . 
  ** poll released in germany today ** [ graph in german ] ( http://media0.faz.net/ppmedia/aktuell/3915019333/1.2897762/default/infografik-ambivalente-reaktion-auf-russland-und-die-ukrainekrise-bild-1-v-2.jpg ) a vast majority is valueing the achievements of russian society , economy and culture . 
  but the amount of germans that think that germany should have close relations with russia is decreasing . 
  76 % think the relation is disrupted . 
  only 10 % see russia as a reliable partner . 
  fun fact : east germany : 28 % want sanctions west germany : 46 % want sanctions, 
  well you are stupid , alecs . 
  i bet you would be completely anti-regime when you had propaganda media telling you all the ( false ) facts all life . 
  you honestly can not blame ` the russians ' for that . 
  your post and its replies are the saddest thing you can read here . 
  there is a petition in germany - they want rt in german , since they think german media is too western and pro-usa :d, 
  ` muslims are the new jews ' . 
  yes . 
  if there is no belgian embassy there , you may seek advice at any eu-country embassy . 
  you can even get a provisory passport if you lost yours . 
  mange tak  i knew about the answers ( ja tak , nej tak ) , but not the actual question . 
  how would you say ? 
  ( sorry about the writing , i suck at spelling danish :d ), 
  i am living in denmark at the moment and i am struggling with this as a german  - how do you ask for something - do you use any phrase to ` nice-up ' your demand or do you just ask away ? 
  ** germany ** i think right-wing extremist parties and worldviews are the biggest threat to europe . 
  i am very pessimistic when it comes to this topic , since i feel that lots of people have these kinds of ressentiments and prejudices . 
  however , in the politcal sphere in germany , they are weaker than one could expect . 
  there is the ` alternative f\u00fcr deutschland ' , a new conservative party , they almost got into german parliament . 
  luckily , they are now fighting each other and there are even streams within the party that are very much tea-party-ish . 
  the other , national socialist ` npd ' is almost irrelevant for federal elections , but they still are in some state parliaments . 
  all in all , i hope that citizens turn their frustration with the system towards other parties , such as the pirate party , who also offers a different approach , but without all the xenophobic anti-euro crap . 
  i am german and i fucking hate putin . 
  i try not to transform these feelings to russia as a state or to russian citizens - but it 's like berlusconi-run italy : i did n't even want to go there anymore just because berlusconi pissed me of so hard and i did n't get why italians could still support him . 
  there is this rumour/joke that the leopards come with special ` anti-riot ' setups . 
  given the arab spring , german tanks rolling against protesters is really nothing that people in germany want to see . 
  of course the saudi arabian state is somehow a partner . 
  but political freedom and citizen rights are so incredibly low that people think it is bad in any case to give them arms supplies . 
  they even declared atheism as bad as terrorism last week . 
  lithuanian citizens can now go to any other european embassy in portugal for help  pretty smart , now you have 20 + choices instead of one . . 
  baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , germany smoking is banned in all bars , discos and restaurants . 
  however , it is allowed to have a ` smoking room ' in your establishment . 
  bars that do not serve food can be a smoking bar aswell . 
  i love that smoking is banned in most places now , it was so disgusting . 
  germany will end when we run out of beer . 
  or russian gas . 
  one should be more outraged because of polluting the canal than because of the people in the boat . 
  how would he know they 're handicapped . 
  nope  jurists found them and the initial accusation was released on sueddeutsche zeitung . 
  most of the other cases were done by a community in a wiki : http://de.guttenplag.wikia.com/wiki/guttenplag_wiki < - red and black are pages that have plagiarism . 
  i read earlier : former education minister schavan lost her title due to plagiarism - but now she got an honorary doctorate from her university instead . 
  you get those for ` great contributions in science ' . 
  how nice of them ...

  guess they did n't need to make an effort since they already won the league . 
  oh well , dissertations . . 
  same problem in germany . 
  since our defense minister guttenberg was proven to have copied most of his dissertation from elsewhere , there has been quite a hunt on other politicians . 
  science ( ! ), 
  and education ( ! ), 
  what is your stance on state-based espionage on ecomonical interests ? 
  [ example ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/25907502 ), 
  well , to have an objective understanding of someone , i usually do n't require their private texts , 
  well i just assumed russians would not be that stupid either  just let me keep my naive faith in humanity :d, 
  why is that ? 
  if european countries go to war , i am confident that the people of europe will stand up against it and stop the crazyness . 
  if they do n't - well , if you have n't learned in the past 70 years you do n't deserve peace . 
  hm , weird , the last dirty bombs in dresden came down 1945 ...  actually - do n't you think this would be supported in gb ? 
  or is everyone d'accord with the whole surveillance-thing ? 
  if the same would be found out about my government , i would want it to be punished . 
  what are your interests ? 
  just studying  it 's equally awesome , if not better . 
  uh no , i 'm german , just living in denmark at the moment . 
  danish language is quite hard to pronounce ( even for germans ) . 
  it 's similar to dutch : many similar words , but when you try to speak it , you are always wrong :d, 
  cheers . 
  i can read dutch , but ca n't speak/understand really . 
  will look for it myself . 
  got source ( s ) ? 
  it 's by dec. 2015 . 
  so if the law passes ( national governments have to approve it ) , you can make holidays with your phone in 2016 . 
  haha - yeah , but their costs are reduced significantly aswell , right ? 
  just imagine all the cross-national phone-bills they had to pay . . 
  wow , eu parliament decides alongside the will of ` the people ' once more . 
  impressive . 
  i like dane . 
  haha , german satirical websites made exactly the same article with zoo employees being too old and put to sleep . 
  well according to this subreddit , it 's mostly about how all the refugees are already radicals . 
  but according to german and danish intelligence , there are no signs of radical islamists being sent on the refugee route to get to germany .
