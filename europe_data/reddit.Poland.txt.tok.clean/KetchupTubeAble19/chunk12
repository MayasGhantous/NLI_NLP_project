  that is all . 
  that german islamists are trying to use the refugees for their own means and exploit their weakness is a completely different story and security services need to crack down on those . 
  uh no . 
  this report is about german islamists recruiting refugees , it is not about islamist militants coming in through refugee routes . 
  german intelligence says the same . 
  random internet picture . 
  i 'll make them tomorrow and show the result for your approval  / edit : have to delay one day , too much breakfast, 
  take some , put it on a plate , take knife and fork . 
  eat like a lasagna or so . 
  at least that 's what i do . 
  enchiladas , no meat .

  season it properly , let it cook for a while . 
  take tortilla , put cr\u00eame fraiche on it . 
  put the vegetable-stuff into it , roll it up and put it in a casserole . 
  do so with all the tortillas .

  welcome and good luck to the new mods !, 
  i hope / r/europe will shine once again , 
  regarding the visibility , at the time i posted that it was said the thread would receive frequent updates with links to specific comment chains to discuss the submissions . 
  i agree with you that specific submissions were less visible because there were no frequent and consistent updates , but you have to agree that the immigration-is-a-problem topic per se has not been made less visible . 
  and you also have to agree that the sub got a variety of new and different submissions during that time . 
  i also wrote this about the possible options the mods have : https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/3etkl7/reurope_mods_create_an_immigration_megathread_to/ctibh3g thanks for your feedback . 
  haha , sure , i do n't want to give away my workplace , but basically submissions are being checked for a variety of criteria ( for example : only questions are allowed ) . 
  the presentation sources ( within reason ) , absence of insults and slurs ( incl . 
  racism ) , questions about the private life , personal data in the submission , and so on . 
  it was just an example , i will obviously not use said guideline in reddit , i used it to point out that i have learned to moderate respecting certain guidelines as opposed to seemingly arbitrary decisions . 
  i hope this clarifies this part a bit , `` special codex '' indeed sounds stupid . 
   how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  multiple times a day , cet afternoons and evenings mostly . 
   how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  multiple times a day , cet afternoons and evenings mostly . 
  my go-to subreddit apart from / r/de . 
   what country are you normally resident in ? 
  germany  do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  german ( native ) , french ( basic ) , danish ( beginner )  what interests you about europe ? 
  european history , identitiy , politics . 
  random facts about all the countries and their cultures and traditions  what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  the only sphere of european public i know that one can interact with easily . 
  i love to get to know and discuss issues with a wide number of people from the european countries . 
  my least favourite thing is probably that racism and xenophobia have common-place in the past year . 
  if these incidents are singular , they can be dealt with easily and some good discussions can occur , however if all threads are dominated by the same rethoric and lack of quality content , it becomes an overall problem of the subreddit . 
   do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  i have been a moderator for a variety of internet forums , but not reddit ( / edit : actually , i just became mod at / r/projectreality ) . 
  most importantly though , i work in the moderation of a german ngo website and have to moderate requests to politicians . 
   why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  because i think i can be a reasonable force in the moderation of the subreddit and do n't want to see one of my favourite subreddits go down the drain of the standard subreddits . 
   why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  where i work , i work according to a special codex and have learned to look for quality of submissions , and not care if they do n't affirm my opinion . 
  i am a firm believer of freedom of speech ( within reasonable limits , i like the system in germany ) and i have learned to accept and support other 's opinions if they are presented in a reasonable way . 
  i can also answer to user requests and i never resort to personal attacks and insults . 
   do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  i have a degree in political science ; however my statistics knowledge is rather limited . 
  i have designed and conducted qualitative surveys though . 
   what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  while i generally supported it , it gave unnecessary fuel to the debate about freedom of speech in the subreddit . 
  i believe a firmer moderation of submissions , checking for duplicates and redundant content could have prevented the drama . 
  however , as the current state of the subreddit shows , the domination and one-sided discussion on immigration issues essentially clogs the subreddit and prevents the interesting and diverse content that / r/europe is loved for . 
  i came here to learn about what is going on in other countries and enjoy a healthy mix of political discussion , random facts and thoughts as well as cultural exchange . 
   what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i am lazy . 
   would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  one hundred duck-sized horses . 
   what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why `` idle '' - `` the quite remarkable adventures of the owl and the pussycat '' was written by him ( eric idle , monty python member ) . 
  when we watched `` the meaning of life '' back in highschool , we discussed why we had to read shitty literature ( short stories ) for the final exams afterwards , and my teacher brought up this book as an alternative . 
  ( i leave it up to you to dcidewheter this story is made up or not ), 
  got a reply yet ? 
  which field & university will it be ? 
  there is also a link to the german version on the top :d, 
  i studied in denmark too and the atmosphere and quality of teaching in the seminars was much better than over here ( i study at a german `` elite '' university , so they should be on par at least ) . 
  did n't have any lectures though , so i ca n't give my opinion on that . 
   pedagogy i 'm in social sciences and we had tons of 90m lectures where you forget everything . 
  even some seminars are bascially 90 % front-talk of the lecturer . 
  surely one of my biggest issues with my programme and university in general . 
   exams 90 % multiple choice exams . 
  it gets better later-on when you can write some papers  bureaucracy works fine at my university . 
   pr\u00fcfungsamt both the secretariate of the university and the one of the programme i 'm in are extremely helpful and fast . 
   technology it 's alright . 
   facilities it 's alright, 
  yeah , half of their mainpage is about things happening on / r/europe . 
  rephrased . 
  by propaganda i just meant that war is shown as super pretty and awesome , the side does n't matter . 
  i did not contest that . 
  i just pointed out that some are from the post-ww2 area . 
  germany and italy have more foreign policy ambitions than the uk ? 
  seems weird . 
  and greece has more foreign policy ambition than it , ger , uk , esp ? 
  and luxembourg and germany have the same level of foreign policy ambition ? 
  would be nice to know their criteria . 
  not all of them are from ww2 ? 
  at least these are not : http://i.imgur.com/bd3zwxd.jpg http://i.imgur.com/4pmhlzl.jpg http://i.imgur.com/5rjamrj.jpg http://i.imgur.com/52gcwmn.jpg but yeah , nice collection of ~ ~ propaganda ~ ~ pictures of mechanical engeneering . 
  almost as bad as the original . 
  not only , but especially south america ; probably because allied influence was quite low overthere . 
  you can read more about it here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratlines_%28world_war_ii_aftermath%29, 
  after ww2 , many nazis fled to south america , there was a lot of them down there after the war .
