  the other big chunck are syrians , those are refugees ( general consensus is : they are the actual ones that need help ; the balkan people might have had a chance if it were n't for the syria war right now ) . 
  the reasons why there are so many people from the balkans are coming at this point are quite unclear , some suspect weird promises made to them domestically and other reasons . 
  maybe a redditor from albania , kosovo , serbia or macedonia can shed some light into this . 
  also , nobody can really deny that people from afghanistan , iraq , syria and similar countries are refugees . 
  funnily enough , there even were 78 asylum seekers from ( / edit ) america this year . 
  [ google sheet with data ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j0kgrwpizppw9zpq-cuve8i13cdatp_qp9z_tusj_ic/edit#gid=0 ) [ article source ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-08/fluechtlinge-prognose-deutschland-europa ), 
  ah , +5 karma bring back good ol' auschwitz comment . 
  haha , i did n't even realize . 
  i hope no eastern germans get offended , 
  [ / r/european be like ... ] ( https://media2.giphy.com/media/8fen5lszchq5o/200_s.gif ), 
  yep , half their frontpage is about stuff happening on / r/europe, 
  this has been submitted before , with 400 comments , a lenghty discussion about the methods ( they are legit ) , and 900 + upvotes . 
  let 's see how it goes this time . 
  yeah i thought the same when i saw it first . 
  `` typical clickbait for circlejerk '' ; but the content was surprisingly good . 
  it says exactly that in the article too . 
  read it , it 's quite balanced . 
  well turn that knowledgeable person into an actual source and downvotes will go away . 
  easy math, 
  i think germany is the only country that fully acknowledged and worked up almost everything that came with that war and is thus one of the very few countries critically questioning it 's own role in history , not only in ww2 , but also before that . 
  of course this was taking a long time , the 50s and 60s had a quite different view on the events . 
  many people say russia should work up its history of atrocities and supression like germany , but given that the soviet regime ended only 20 years ago , this will take another 20 - 40 years to happen in my opinion . 
  as a german , i find it completely fine and accurate to use `` germans '' here . 
  which book ? 
  is it good ? 
  oh look , a source as good as any other in this thread having -40 points . 
  ( german ) , i prefer hamburg over berlin . 
  the water and waterways are awesome in hamburg and there is a lot of cool stuff there . 
  berlin is too widespread for me , one big-ass conglomerate without anything properly structuring it . 
  c\u00e9rtainement http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1352/4721447238_103e3e4564_z.jpg https://fr.linkedin.com/in/damienclauzel sorry / u/dclauzel for posting this , but truth helps against plain retardation . 
  that was a rally against the recent investigations against journalists who published whistleblower things about german intelligence increasing social media surveillance . 
  the protesters asked the novorossiya people to go away because obviously their demands are not relevant at all to the rally and would only discredit their intent . 
  same would 've happened if some trolls would have gone in there with any other agenda really , not big news . 
  what they say is inaudible , the speech is dominating everything , it 's about free speech , surveillance services , media , whistleblower et cetera . 
   r/european is very moderate !, 
  your comment suggests otherwise . 
  given that you could freely move 70-80 % of comments made in immigration thread # 1 to immigration thread # 2 and # 3 without realising that the submitted content was different proves that wrong . 
  that clears some things up , thanks . 
  but still , not everything is cleared up , i will definitely wait and see . 
  i do n't want to turn my pc into some sort of big-ass smartphone with no feeling of control :d, 
  wow nice , thanks for this !, 
  https://i.imgur.com/j35bxaw.png disclaimer : i do n't have in-depth knowledge , so i do n't know how legit this all is . 
  google search gives plenty of results for all claims though . 
  thank you  but ` maceration using high speed grinder ' does n't sound like quality western animal welfare ideology no matter how fast it kills . 
  just one example : every year , 50 * million * male chicken get shreddered by the meat industry because they are of no use . 
  it is only forbidden in 2 german states and only since last year or so . 
  methods of culling include cervical dislocation , asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and * maceration using a high speed grinder * . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chick_culling ) not saying movements to increase animal rights are not coming out of western society , but that is by a good part because the same society massively abuses animals in the industry . 
  i also support it , but do n't you think `` wester society '' brought us the epitome of animal abuse , which is massive industrial animal processing plants ? 
  i mean basically only denmark has some very modern and animal-friendly facilities , but there are * a lot * of shady things happening even in europe . 
  so the `` not in western society '' argument does n't really go far . 
  also , not 40 years ago most animals were killed by hand and without anaesthetisation . 
  treating animals well is a very new development really and only got wider support with the whole organic movement in the past years . 
  made a translation if you have problems understanding : http://i.imgur.com/ddwh012.jpg, 
  thanks , now i can finally look at stuff on / r/europe again without having to check if i 'm on / r/european every 2 minutes . 
   the only reason that i 'm here is to make sure that one day my son is better off than me , '' he says . 
  suddenly , his self-confident facade begins to quiver , and the look in his eyes hints at the deep pain that he carries inside , constantly tortured by the thought of his wife and son stuck back in syria . 
   communication with them is difficult . 
  `` there are always power outages in syria , and internet connections are very bad , '' he says . 
  he wants to get his family to safety , here to germany , as quickly as possible . 
  he has already applied for papers for his wife and his 3-year-old son . 
  now he has to wait . 
  debunking the `` all are young men , it must be them coming for other reasons ! '', 
  - ( young ) men are often better educated than the women and speak more languages - men are responsible for the financial well-being of their families ( traditionally ) - men are more likely to be forced into combat - men are more likely to make it to europe , some routes ( sinai ) are not safe for women - families can often only afford one person travelling to europe - most families flee to refugee camps in the border regions ( syria ) - families then send the person with the highest chances ( see above ) of reaching europe source [ de ] : http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/fluechtlinge-in-europa-warum-vor-allem-maenner-asyl-suchen-1.2584201 the more dangerous and expensive the route , the fewer women and children you can see . 
  why did i go to morocco when the best starlight was just an hour drive away in austria . . 
  http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-876660-galleryv9-ljae.jpg between january and june of 2015 , racists attacked facilities providing accommodations for asylum-seekers on an almost daily basis . 
  it 's a grim statistic , but the real figures may be even higher , because many refugees are afraid to report incidents to police . 
  i recommend you read the whole article . 
   you must be patriotic to your new home and loyal - leave behind old alegiances what ? 
  close relative is french , lives in germany . 
  he cheers for france in the worldcup , tour de france and everywhere else and prefers french food over german . 
  he is also not a patriot of germany ( or france , for that matter ) . 
  this claim is ridiculous :d, 
  http://i.imgur.com/0k4kju1.jpg if they throw stones , it is an attack . 
  but if it 's true what you said , it is still an undesputable fact that the number of attacks has been rising . 
  just look at the amount of arson attacks in the last couple of months . 
  unprecedented . 
  you are a christian . 
  or if not that , you are associated with christianity , born as one , whatever . 
  someone else is a christian extremist on a crusade and deems your way of living christianity unworthy . 
  that 's the difference between muslim and islamist . 
   no healthy european culture is seriously existentially threatened exactly, 
  relevant username . 
  you must be kidding :d / nevermind . 
  looking at your post history , you 're clearly not . 
  this thread shows that europeans totally do n't hate others for their religion :d, 
  you mean free hate speech alternative, 
  all i see is french flags , 
  well i used both extremist and terrorist in the title . 
  terrorist making terrorist attack sounds stupid , hence extremist . 
   gov ` t , those lazy fuckers https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e2lt7/living_in_switzerland_ruined_me_for_america/ctbe0bs , 
  hello and `` welcome '' to reddit . 
  that source though ... `` revolutionary nationalist anders behring '' '' . . the youth auxiliary of norway 's left-wing , anti-white labor party . '',

  thank you . 
  another one : [ translation ] ( http://www.norway-un.org/norwayandun/norwegian_politics/our-response-will-be-more-openness-more-democracy-/ ) ( that 's a speech he held at the public oslo rally , not the church ) .
