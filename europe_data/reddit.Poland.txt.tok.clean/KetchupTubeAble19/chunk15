  that is norway . '', 
  the amount of money made ready for * new * infrastructure projects is way too big in my opinion . 
  we ca n't even keep up the stuff we have right now . 
  waterways and railway infrastructure need some ** serious ** financing as soon as possible , same with thousands of bridges . 
  the watergates in the northsea-baltic-sea channel , the most frequented water way in the world are from 1914 still . . http://www.faz.net/aktuell/technik-motor/umwelt-technik/nord-ostsee-kanal-eine-wasserstrasse-als-dauerbaustelle-12118716-p2.html, 
  they have , but they come here because people are `` racially aware '' already ... 
  do you even alligator ? 
  ah right , so if the public is aware of radicals preaching stuff there ( which is unlikely , given it 's funded by turkey , who - although becoming more islamist - are nowhere near radical islam ) , then romanian officials will do * nothing * ? 
  i think a mega mosque is more likely to be in the public eye , and thus less prone to radicalization of its members . 
  but that 's just me . . small communities , out of sight from mainstream , with tight group cohesion is where stuff like that is * more likely * ( still pretty unlikely though ) . 
  aaahh yes , victim blaming always helps . 
  ^ ^ / s my point was , no matter what you think of immigrants , burning down their temporary homes surely is n't helping with anything . 
  well , if not daily , at least you see something about it in the news every couple of days , do n't you agree ?

  same happening in germany , almost daily we get news of to-be refugee camps being burned down , yesterday some people fired guns at a refugee facility . 
  yeah i also think it was downed by buk as shown by bellingcat investigation , but this video does n't show a lot . 
  also , what did they mean with the parachuting ? 
  nope  i specified it a bit more . 
  taking a walk in the forest with an old buddy and other friends . 
  end up getting killed by said buddy . 
   tax reform related measures  pension related measures finally a comprehensive and clear outline of the plans the government intends to use in order to combat greece 's problems !, 
  try buying a swastika t-shirt in germany . 
  wow , some very good content in there . 
  it 's still being done , but without any outside support i think , many german ` handwerker ' go on the walz . 
  yes , and it should n't be for highly educated people only , but also for craftsmen and other jobs and educations that are not on university-level . 
  i agree . 
  worst thing is - most of the time you can get the same news story from 10 other , unbiased ( or less biased ) sources or with a link to the original incident it refers to , so having to look at rt ; sputnik , dailymail and other crap daily makes it even worse . 
  scumbag europe , pretends to be safeguard of freedom and rights , then proceeds doing shit like that . 
  i just hope that opposition in germany will remain and become more fierce . 
  luckily , a good number of people have n't forgotten about the easter german surveillance state , which is not even on the same level as this . . 
  it becomes more frequent : [ heat waves in 5 german cities starting 1950 ] ( https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/t31.0-8/11411628_879708965428094_8655113306016894571_o.png ) ( max . 
  annual amount of 14-day heat periods with a average temperature of at least 30 \u00b0 c ), 
  oxi means no ? 
  and nai means yes ? 
  the institute who made the survey is quite reliable . 
  only the turkey country sample is from turkey . 
  the german muslims in the infas sample were not exclusively from turkey/turkish heritage . 
  study was made by a different institute , see their methods here : https://www.infas.de/kompetenzen/stichprobenkonzepte/#ic351,

  my apologies , i had you confused ( [ this thread is the one i meant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3axn0s/middle_eastern_christian_refugees_in_europe_are/ ) ), 
  which prooves that it is `` not being sweeped under the rug '' . 
  not the point . 
  have a look at the threads on / r/de and / r/france about the attacks . 
  actual discussions , people * discussing * things , balanced opinions . 
  head to / r/europe , insane anti-islamic cirklejerk . 
  i would 've accepted that , but looking at the other eu subreddits makes me think that something 's not quite right in / r/europe . 
  if we have submissions here being upvoted from pjmedia and similar sites ( you did that i think ? ), 
  instead of * actual * , balanced , or first-hand sources ( you could 've linked just the video , but no . . ) , then mods need to step in in my opinion . 
  do n't know , but last time i checked 30-50 % of submissions last week were about ( im ) migrants & islam . 
  yes please !, 
  ( unless you just made a holocaust joke , which i ( as a german ) did n't get ), 
  look at the threads in / r/de and / r/france regarding this incident . 
  not a lot of problems there , balanced views and discussions . 
  then look at / r/europe and you have one big-ass islamophobic circlejerk . 
  i wonder why . 
  it 's time to spam the subreddit with `` train stations of xyz '' again , i miss those times . 
  i think he 's doing fine , this is being blown out of proportion . 
  if you have a problem with lack of him updating the megathread ( is n't a livethread for continuus updates anyways ? 
  ) , just make/find a comment with frequent updates and you 're good to go . 
  we literally had 8-10 submissions on the attack in france , so why not bundle it in a megathread . 
  ofc now everyone hops on the bandwagon to scream censorship and ask people to head over to / r/europe 's little nazi brother sub . 
  yeh , we only had ~ 50 % of submissions doing exactly that the past week . 
  need even more !, 
  until recently , i was under the impression that / r/europe was n't as effected as other parts of reddit . 
  guess i was wrong  now that / r/european looks pretty much the same ( again ) it 's no surprise people `` confuse '' them . 
  ye it 's sick that nobody cares to look at the page this is being posted on and just jumps on the `` muh religion of peace '' train . 
  i know , i said it . 
  just wanted to give another sentiment that many ( ? ), 
  germans share after all they learned about ww2 . 
  i do n't know , one the one hand yes , it is bad , it is a crime , these are atrocities , they need to be adressed by the countries who committed them and be taken into their national rememberance - but on the other hand , as a german i ca n't help but thinking that this was ` our ' own fault and it was kinda justified ( which even people back then said ~ `` just look what we did in russia , they will pay it back to us tenfold '' ) . 
  is that a vote for parties ? 
  what 's described in the text in the middle ? 
  what 's the purpose of the different years ( 1946 , 44 , 53 , 65 , 52 . . ) ? 
  german forests make us independent from outside suppliers , we learned enough to know that we can only rely on our domestic resources in a war . 
  broomsticks are the way to go for germany 's military independence and power projection capabilites . 
  it does , it crosses the fehmarnbelt in a ferry , which is pretty fucking cool  there 's also a ice connection from berlin/hamburg to aarhus , you can change trains at fredericia and hop in the train for copenhagen . 
  you can be interested . 
  but you wo n't go and like a facebook profile where you are most likely going to understand * nothing * . 
  merkel 's page is german , by germans , for germans . 
  there 's nothing there in english that would even remotely attract international audience . 
  well , why would you like a page of a politician that sends daily updates in a language that you do n't understand ? 
  also , do n't base it on actual vietnam population , but rather facebook users . 
  the point is that those ` likes ' are most likely just bought .

  no , that was just me being stupid . 
  oopsie , sorry about that !, 
  disgusting , they should know better . 
  warsaw rising museum was the best museum i have ever visited . 
  very very impressive . 
  oh look , the most * shitty * newspapers in europe are in there too . 
  i think it 's fine to have a hybrid , inconsistent form ; kinda reflects reality quite well , 
  translation - both parties ( cdu & spd ) agreed on a new wording after the word `` v\u00f6lkermord '' ( genocide ) was n't included in the first draft of the resolution - opposition parties had accused the governing parties of unjustified considerateness towards the turkish government . 
  - the german * government * is still critical towards calling it a genocide officially . 
  foreign minister steinmeier ( spd ) said that it was not worth sacrificing possible future dialogue between the two sides ( turks and armenians ) if germany were to call it a genocide and further polarize the debate, 
  classic thelocal clickbait , really disappointing .

  great , now can we finally have a new subreddit survey ?
