  i do n't see how this is a problem . 
  of course this is being used to discredit them , but i am sure there are things much worse that need to be adressed . 
  eating dogs happens in other places too and nobody gives a shit . 
  people eat pets ( rabbits , birds ) and lambs etc all the time . 
  no need to get on the same level of propaganda as the other side and stir up and overdramatize no-news . 
  it 's war . 
  people eat shit . 
  / edit : disclaimer , i 'm not a putinbot . 
  thanks .

  hi , thanks for letting me know . 
  i had assumed it was okay as previous `` series '' - submissions were always made fun of that way ( f.ex `` winter in xxx '' , fog in xxx ; train stations and so on . . ) . 
  i guess my submission falls under community rule ( 4 ) . 
  i apologize , 
  why did nobody say ** surprise anschluss !, 
  ** yet ? 
  so edgy , but you got me . 
  if you look at the transatlantic route for example , aircraft seem to make a huge detour instead of going directly for their destination . 
  however , you need to take into account the shape of the earth which is not accurately depicted in a map : look how all the aircraft actually fly http://www.ashokamaran.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/flightroutes1.jpg ( or here , eu air corridors : https://i.imgur.com/auychvg.jpg ) other factors include taking starting and landing corridors that are not-so populated to avoid noise-pollution of the people living below , which , i guess , is why it 's flying over mountains + oceans in this case ( + the fastest route as explained above ) . 
  you can get a flag ( `` flair '' ) on the right side : `` zeige meine pers\u00f6nlichkeit auf diesem subreddit . '', 
  going down at 3500 feet/minute at 370 + knots .

  nsfw ) even the biggest piece of the aircraft you can see is pretty fucking small .

  yes , plenty of other submissions already . 
  downvoted this one and sputniknews . 
  really not needed for this type of news . 
  german + french sources are the best for this obviously . 
  i upvoted you and agree that the discussion here has become very very one-dimensional and unreflected . 
  even if based on geopolitical realities , the rhetoric used in this subreddit , talking about the evil russian threat , war , and labeling all russians the same is indeed a sad development . 
  rightly so , still not like it 's a huge deal on / r/europe do n't you think ? 
  ye , submitted three times and look at all the upvotes and comments it got ... 
  that 's weird , in germany it looks like [ this ] ( http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-826296-galleryv9-tgqf.jpg ) , slightly different international version i guess ? 
  well i do n't know if small-arms and tanks really are enough for saudi arabia to go to war , besides , who are they to go to war with anytime soon ? 
  but i think i got your argument . 
  but i do n't know , pretty sure germany would immediately stop all exports ( they already did ) if saudi arabia were to go into an ` un-approved ' war . 
  also we can sell what we want to saudi arabia for our own small share of influence , haha . 
  http://www.dw.de/confusion-over-german-arms-exports-to-saudi-arabia/a-18216014 http://www.dw.de/arms-export-report-shows-saudi-arabia-as-top-german-customer/a-17241190, 
  it 's pretty smart actually , as the sanctions would be not possible in the first place :d, 
  did i say that ? 
  just call them out for what they are doing instead of hypocritically condemning one regime while backing the other . 
  no embargo , but maybe do n't sell weapons and security tech , germany for example changed their stance and is now not selling leopard 2 's to saudi arabia . 
  people pretend like saudi arabia is a secret haven of stability in the region , which it is clearly not . 
  it is actively funding and fueling the sectarian divide and conflicts in the region for the whole purpose of dividing sunni and shia so that nobody can challenge their rule domestically . 
  not to speak of their sick repression of minorities , women , foreign workers or anyone basically who does n't support their wahhabism . 
  anyone going against this fucked-up government and taking the consequences ( no oil for you ! ), 
  deserves respect . 
  there is no such thing as `` ignoring power politics '' or `` geopolitics '' . 
  calling the swedes naive for doing it is just pointless . 
  saudi arabia is a shit regime and there is absolutely no need for anyone to cooperate with them if it was n't for the greedy oil and military bases interests . 
  sweden wo n't suffer heavy consequences from calling them out , but it will weaken their position as a third-party negotiator that was often used . 
  i 'd rather have a foreign policy such as this than `` oh we are so liberal and democratic '' at home and `` let 's achieve what we want with whatever means with whoever is fit '' abroad . 
  cheers !, 
  do you have a news source on that first part ( `` what actually happened '' ) ? 
  do n't want to relay it without proper sourcing of the first part , 
  i guess not , and anyways , there would be too many german puns that would badly translate into english , 
  launch the ~ ~ rockets ~ ~ minarets to intercept !, 
  oh no wait , you banned them . 
  it 's not a sunni muslim thing . 
  http://www.stopfgmmideast.org/background/islam-or-culture/ http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/, 
  hahaha , that was spot on !, 
  it 's so weird that house of cards was n't able to get an actual russian to play the part . 
  guess they picked mikkelsen because he has the same hair colour as putin :d, 
  international co-production : denmark , germany , austria , switzerland , belgium . 
  actors speak their natural languages mostly , many dialogues are in english though . 
  of course , stupid german television had to make fully synchronized german version ... ( it 's original on the web though : http://www.zdf.de/the-team/the-team-35858908.html, 
  ha , well . 
  it 's german tv , so that 's all you can expect unfortunately . 
  crime is all they do . 
  ever . 
  it 's based on swedish-danish series `` broen '' which is about oresund bridge . 
  wow , the downvote is real , wtf . . 
   lack of manliness facing the invasion your country is suffering there is no invasion - if anything , we are manlier than you are ( lol ) because we are not afraid our culture will melt away because of a couple of thousand new muslims . 
  tell me how they will stop things like the wagner festspiele , operas , oktoberfest , and whatever else you think is great about germany . 
   thousands of women are sexually abused , boys are raped in pools , older men and women ca n't walk safely on the streets and all reaction i see is a group if feminists welcoming them when they arrive at germany . 
  factually wrong - you should come visit instead of phantasizing from portugal ( < nice country btw , went there last year ) . 
  and no , do n't come sending me those media reports , we are very aware . 
  looking at * actual * statistics and everyday life things are still pretty normal here . 
  you would be surprised . 
  but i guess , since you seem to frequent / r nationalsocialism ( oh god , ad hominem again ? ), 
  there is really no point . 
  i wish a good night to the periphery of the continent . 
  so you insult me , my country , the women and the institutions that make it - i respond by making a joke about your username and you proceed to call me out on my ad-hominem insult . 
  that 's quite rich . 
  / edit : please elaborate on your statements . 
  according to your username , german grammar is also quite weak . 
  oh you must have a bad day, 
  fixed to : one of the five suspected perpetrators searched with a european-wide warrant . 
  `` well there was this cologne rapist that i followed all the way to switzerland and then got arrested and extradited to germany '', 
  nah , it pays off . 
  you can have one detective for several stores - no need for security personell for each store . 
  no , they hire actual detectives who look like normal customers, 
  konstanz ( de ) / kreuzlingen ( ch ) - after 2 young men put cigarettes and groceries into their rucksack in konstanz ' lago shopping center , they left the store without paying . 
  a store detective saw them and followed them on foot . 
  after the two men crossed the border to switzerland , the detective contacted german police in konstanz . 
  he led a swiss police patrol to a building in freiestrasse . 
  the two men ( 19 and 24yrs old ) were found there . 
  after calling in swiss border guards , they found the stolen goods ( and more ) in the 19yr old man 's rucksack .
