  spiegel has been closing it 's sections to comment for like a year now , nothing special in that regard . 
  this is still the only source saying that ( the express article ) , the statement of one anonymous police officer , who controlled one group inside of it . 
  also , he did not detain anyone , only on the days afterwards people got detained ( 5 of them ) , now there are 3 more suspects , so i 'd take this with a grain of salt . 
  all other people are saying these are police-known criminals that have been there for quite some time . 
  oh them downvotes . . 
   murican_1776, 
  good guy eu, 
  they have the right to move to and work in germany . 
  yep : `` furthermore , it is stated that the immigrants ' net contribution to the social security and welfare system helps to counteract the problems arising due to the continuous aging of the population . '',

  uh no, 
  soon we have to leave out ww1 in those series . 
  i included it still , because 2015 - 1915 . 
  no major ( islamistic ) terrorist attack in germany will happen in 2016 . 
  the german state of hesse still has the ** death penatly ** in its constitution . 
  it states `` if someone has been found guilty of a criminal act , he can be sentenced to death '' ( art . 
  21 ) but since in this case , federal law beats state law , it is not applied . 
  it has not been changed because it requires a referendum on the change of the constitution . 
  you still have to use your own power using electric bikes , and they allow travelling a ) faster and b ) over longer distances , even for people without the physical capabilities . 
  this means even more people will use a bicycle . 
  cross at the traffic light when it 's red , that 'll show us . 
  my friend , you forgot the [ pol1z1stens0hn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4w5cqm3f_c ) !, 
  it stated in the description :  in order to appeal to the emotions of the macedonian border troops , some refugees send their women and children to the front lines . 
  with the mass of people pushing from the back , children get separated from their parents and are sometimes taken across the border by strangers while their parents and relatives are unable to get through . 
  another tragedy within this global tragedy that starts in afghanistan , iraq and syria -- and obviously does n't end in europe . 
  so yeah , keep your shitty bias to yourself . 
  furthermore , this award is about children , kinda hard to connect 5-yr olds to allahu ackbar screams on a photo ( no sound buddy ! ), 
   we have been fighting for hundreds of years to get the right balance between government , companies and individuals . 
  i fear this balance has been destroyed . 
  the government has all this information and the balance of power in society is at risk . 
  very true, 
  [ they see me rolling ] ( http://i.imgur.com/suwq7.jpg ) excellent collection , anyone got more of those ? 
  terrorism is convenient , is n't it , 
  [ i did my best ] ( http://i.imgur.com/idaitdl.jpg ) the world used to be so simple  ^ [ on_a_more_serious_note . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bzzs6qk.jpg ), 
  the booing was directed towards the people shouting , not the minute of silence . 
  title is misleading . 
  but hmm . . https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t5efq/all_paris_attackers_identified_so_far_are/ what 's with that then heh ? 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/de/comments/3so2zd/die_zahl_der_fl%c3%bcchtlinge_in_deutschland_steigt/cwz0c2r this should give more insight, 
  this is a very valuable comment , thank you . 
  sexual crimes are below 1 % . 
  this means those are not more or less criminal than germans . 
  the point is not to make the syrians fighters , but to integrate them into german society . 
  proper bootcamp , language courses , drivers licenses , helping with the refugee crisis ( logistical support ) etc with background checks is the idea . . 
  since the civil sphere is overburdened with the amount of refugees , taking some into the army would actually be a good idea . 
  doing the same as a german, 
  i 'd be interested in a regular supply of deruijter hagelslag and calv\u00e9 pindakaas . 
  i hope this gets approved by the european commission , we really need the esfe . 
  first projections are in akp : 53,2 % chp : 20.9 % mhp : 11,1 % hdp : 11 % others : 3,9 % . 
  source : euronews , trt, 
  cleaning up your mess maybe, 
  yeah i also agreed that supplying the kurds was good . 
  but supporting golf states at the same time , who themselves are said to support isis , well ... oh and also being with turkey , which is fighting the kurds . 
  it just does n't uncluster the clusterfuck i 'm afraid . 
  that is the simplification of the caricature . 
  germany is supplying kurds , saudi arabia , and other states ( iraq ) in the middle east , germany was also actively involved in the afghan war , where a signficant portion of the refugees come from . 
  obviously the true causal chain is exponentionally more complex , but germany played its role , you ca n't blame everything on the us .

  finally !, 
  although you are 271 subscribers too late !, 
  this will skew the results !, 
  fixed again :d, 
  cheers !, 
  fixed . 
  yeah , changed it on top to be more clear . 
  what ? 
  it is a list of actions related to the refugee crisis . 
  if you read it properly , you see that it actually lists perpetrations commited by asylum seekers . 
  given the dominance of the topic in this subreddit , the title , while general , is appropriate . 
  also , the original title is called `` 7 days in germany '' . 
  what do you mean ? 
  looking good , hoping for proper enforcement . 
  largest german rally in the past six or so years , should be more prominent here really . 
  * good economy and some statistical effect are the reasons * 20 million pensioners will get the biggest raise in 20 years * reason for statistical effect : the calculation of the average income has changed * western pensioner getting standard pension of 1314 $ will most likely get 57 $ + per month after 45 working years * similar increase last happened in 1993 * general trend because of demographic change still puts a big strain on the pension system . 
  savings dropped from 32,6 to 32,8 billion from july to august, 
  because the situation is not changing . 
  flee from war , live in a camp for a year , hoping it gets better . 
  stay another year stay another year stay another year do something with your life and move . 
   ps : there will be a / r/europe survey at 500.000 ( a cool half a million ) subscribers . 
  aww jizz , finally, 
  lung cancer, 
  if you liked prague , maybe try dresden in eastern germany . 
  still one of the cheaper german cities . 
  travelling around , mostly alentejo , also coimbra , tomar etc. 
  just came back from a week in portugal . 
  if the one with the most election posters wins , it 's going to be cdu / ps from what i 've seen :d, 
  can you elaborate on that ` fraud ' ? 
  how did obama `` trigger '' the arab spring ? 
  fixed , try to read it again !, 
  no , i did n't edit it . 
  but i had to re-read it twice before i was sure i said what i meant to say after people started commenting how i want to ban protests , 
  fin ~ ~ n ~ ~ ish reading !, 
  '' ... shows how they are plain wrong '', 
  no , i think them being allowed to do it shows that they are wrong . 
  i acknowledge that they can protest . 
  sorry , i guess it 's poorly phrased ( i blame mobile . . ) . 
  i meant to say that if what they propagate were true , they would not be able to protest where they are protesting in the first place .
