  read again , that is not even remotely what i implied . 
  yeah they piss me off to no end . . the simple fact that those nutjobs are even allowed to stay in front of the bundestag with their megaphones and silly posters , with thousands of tourists seeing them every day just shows how they are plain wrong . 
  a pdf with some more info : http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/evaluation/pdf/expost2013/wp1_synthesis_factsheet_en.pdf, 
  80 % of my friends and family are on telegram . 
  works well if the other app has good arguments . 
  i know . 
  i mentioned them as `` no significant role '' because some of their drama in the refugee crisis was in the media quite prominently and thus could have had a liiittle influence . 
  it 's a spectrum , do n't think so binary . 
  if you want to add more parties to the cdu ( center-right ) and afd ( far-right ) , you can add the csu ( bavarian-right ) or the npd ( extreme-right ) , both of which played no significant role in this election . 
  german mainstream media i read today said the same . 
  more than 6 % surplus seriously affects stability and is bad for the eurozone . 
  it also states that most of the demand comes from other eu countries . 
  so it 's not being sweeped under the rug . 
  i agree with you on the armchair economists though :d, 
  - the initial plan of abolishing roaming fees in spring 2017 left open possible limitations - the eu commission today made a proposal on how such limitations may look like - according to the commission , eu citizens who are abroad will only be able to use their phones without extra charge for a total of 90 days - after 30 days , the phone operator should be allowed to ask the costumer to join the local net again - flatrate costumers should be allowed to use their average consumption - these limitations are in place to avoid that people can get cheaper phone contracts from other eu states and permanently live with them in their home country . 
  -- personally , i think this is a bad move and that the problem they seek to address with it can be solved differently , for instance by requiring a physical address ( residence ) in the country where you get the contract in for example . 
  ( edit : maybe not so good , see below ) if you have friends all over the continent , or live abroad , we should be able to freely contact them with our standard contracts in the area of the common market no matter where we currently are . 
  our constitution can be changed , most of it . 
  some basics must remain the same though ( like federalism , also art . 
  1 and art . 
  it needs 2/3 of votes in both chambers for a change . 
  just because you have a sense of global or european identity does n't mean that you loose your uk / cornwall / regional / village / family identity . 
  would you not agree ? 
  we should ban assault camels first , everyone has a constitutional right for camels . 
  well she is right though : `` the phenomenon of islamist terrorism , of is , is not a phenomenon that came to us with the refugees '' . 
  - it is a phenomenon that was here , or would be here no matter what . 
  800 germans went to syria for isis before the refugee crisis even started . 
   `` we have said clearly that an islam that works and lives on the basis of the constitution ... belongs to germany , '' merkel said . 
   she added that a type of islam that did not stick to the constitution or accept equal rights for women had no place in the country . 
  this is why i hate cellar bars and clubs . 
  went to prag the other month and it was full of basement clubs and bars that only had one exit . 
  does n't feel comfortable at all . 
  ( german media reported it was a cellar bar ) . 
  yes . 
  as a welcome , you get discount on sand castle railway and have the right of beach towel placement 3 hours before actually taking the spot . 
  special offer : two-hour slot in left lane of autobahn with your caravan if you pay your taxes on time . 
  yes . 
  you get your swamp id soon . 
  the funny part is that you did n't include a source for this statement . 
  aha , so you heard that ? 
  if this is not local news , i do n't know what is . 
   a doctor had been shot at and the gunman ( * a patient * ) had killed himself . 
  you know in a german thread there was a guy listing all knife attacks in the past days , i think it was like one knife attack every two days committed by ( in your terms ) `` normal '' people . 
  and no , it was not a machete , it was a knife used for kebab from the shop . 
  any large group of people will have some individuals that commit crime and unfortunately that will include men that kill women . 
  most of those stories will hardly get any coverage . 
  so the fact that this has gained ** a lot ** of traction in germany - does n't it mean we are in fact , not in denial ? 
  but what it turned out to be , a relationship drama , a crime of passion , then that 's what it is and that is what it will be called . 
   `` ca n't be sure it 's muslims '' ... when was the last time you saw a white person do this in europe ? 
  with `` this '' i assumed you meant mass-shootings , not screaming allahu ackbar or `` god wants it '' . 
  also the allahu ackbar thing is unconfirmed by police . 
  apparently the `` allahu ackbar '' was screamed by someone else and was in fact `` alle runter '' which means ` everybody get down ' .

   it 's only speculation ... 
  yes , which is why it 's not being talked about at a press conference . 
  this is directly from the police press conference live stream . 
  that is such a retarded statement . 
  it 's as pointless as saying `` if you were never born you would n't have made this post ! '', 
  his mother was german . 
  new press-conference , i just tuned in so missed some things . 
  here is all i got from it : - 18year old still went to school - glock 17 , where it came from will be invesitgated - he had ~ 300 rounds , amount of shots fired and shooter skill unclear - he did not have a gun license - no indication about relation to wurzburg attacks - possible winnenden ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winnenden_school_shooting ) glorification , there was intensive material found on former rampages , lots of media from his computer will be investigated - possible psychological condition , he was in treatment - attacker had one brother , him and his parents lived with the perpetrator - all relatives of victimes notified - victims mostly young , 14 - 21 , one woman of 45 ( inaudible ) - deaths happened inside & outside mcdonalds and in the mall . 
  - about allahu-ackbar : there are no hints pointing at connection to islam , everything * right now * points at rampage , not is . 
  - gsg9 was requested according to plan ( terror ) by police . 
  they were used for clearing the suspect 's flat and were ready to respond to further gunmen - nationalities of victims unclear , not sure if he aimed for specific people ( except young ), 
  no , it 's most likely related to w\u00fcrzburg attacks that had people from hong kong injured . 
  continued : ** q&a ** reporter : `` stacchus situation ? '', 
   chief : `` according to reports , there were shots , but as in all other cases , these claims were unsubstantiated '' reporter : `` you said 18-year old german-iranian from munich , can you tell me about him and also about the firefight with police ? '', 
   chief : `` we are at the beginning , until we are not sure about security we could not conduct crime scene investigations . 
  it began at the fast-food restaurant , moved over to the mall and then the perpetrator fled . 
  in this time he had contact with officers in officers in plain clothes on patrol who engaged him . 
  but we have to check all of this before we can make sure what exactly happened . '', 
  reporter : `` can you tell me more about the person ? 
  has he been living there for longer ''  chief : `` yes ! '', 
  reporter : `` can you elaborate on this ? 
  how long ? 
  more than two years ? '', 
   chief : `` yes '' . 
  reporter : inaudible ; talking about video of the parking lot . 
   chief : i ca n't confirm any of this at the moment . 
  reporter : was this person known to police ? 
   chief : no , he was not . 
  reporter : can you talk about the gun and how he did it ? 
   chief : he started in the fast-food restaurant , went outside to the mall ( see explanation above ) . 
  reporter : statement on islamist ties , motives ? 
   chief : needs to be subject to investigations of course , no hints at this point . 
  reporter : type of firearm ? 
   chief : apparently a pistol , rest is up to investigation . 
  reporter : family ? 
   chief : unknown at this point . 
  reporter : so the long-weapon theory was wrong ? 
   chief : we have absolutely no indications about long weapons . 
  reporter : what about the back-back ? 
   chief : found that , but no rifle inside . 
  reporter : bombs ? 
   chief : no . 
  reporter : ammo on him , given the amount of deaths ? 
   chief : well there are firearms with larger magazines , but theoretically he can reload of course , we will have to see how often he fired , how many shells were ejected , then we know more . 
  reporter : reports about [ inaudible ] car  chief : there was a car in the beginning that left the scene with high speed . 
  they were completely unrelated to the case , as much as all other reports .
