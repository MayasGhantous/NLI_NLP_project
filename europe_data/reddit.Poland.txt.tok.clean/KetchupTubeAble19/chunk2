  why should n't they be invited ? 
  how can you not have a native language ? 
  if your parents raised you with 3 languages synchronically , i 'd say those are your native languages then ?

  germany / austria / switzerland ca n't even make up my mind myself , 
  equal rights for women = women and men are equal . 
  do n't argue that the church needs to work for more men 's rights right now . . 
  kurds seem to be the only decent group in there , which is why they should be supported imo . 
  chances are that the weapons get into other people 's hands as it happens every time they get delivered somehwere .

  sure , just hit me pm when you have a question , 
  ask german redditors for help , 
  ** germany ** the , in my opinion , by far best news service is the ` deutschlandradio ' ( germany radio ) . 
  http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/ the best paper , in my opinion is the ` sueddeutsche zeitung ' ( southern german newspaper ) http://www.sueddeutsche.de/ other ` reliable ' sources are spiegel ( www.spiegel.de ) , zeit ( www.zeit.de ) , right-wing die welt ( www.welt.de ) , ard ( www.tagesschau.de ) , zdf ( www.heute.de ) , frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ( www.faz.net ) and the left ` die tageszeitung ' ( www.taz.de ) etc etc then you have tabloids like bild , which are okayish , but simply suck because everything is over-dramatized . 
  ** breaking news ** bird pooped on vladimir putins suit ... cmon , he did n't even hit the head . 
  i guess this proposition gets pretty high support in the population ? 
  do they ( venstre ) honestly believe in that or is it just a tactical move to weaken df ?

  that was some 40.000 years ago . 
  after that , there was tribal life ( teutons , celts , scythians ) . 
  in the end , they were all called teutons ( `` germanen '' in german , which is why you call us germans ) . 
  there were `` north-sea-teutons '' , `` rhine-weser-teutons '' and `` elbe-teutons '' . 
  and then there were also the romans . 
  but most of what they did happened a.d. and therefore we 'll deal with that next time !, 
  cool !, 
  although it is unfortunate that you only have one design for all coins . 
  what does laisv\u0116 , vienyb\u0116 , gerov\u0116 mean ?

  well there are some people living nearby who complain about noise , but you have those everywhere near any airport . 
  and then there are the people who are against foreign forces ( us ) presence in germany completely .

  - relatives and family of a rape victim beat a 27-year old man to death near the french border . 
  - before that , a warrant was issued to arrest the man for raping a young woman in the far south west of germany . 
  however , he was on the run , when 2 family members and 2 friends beat him to death on a car park . 
  - police is investigating if the four met the man accidentally or if they were following him . 
  mob law and vigilatnism .
