  reporter : victims ? 
   chief : please understand we do n't want to say something because we are identifying the identity of the victims and are contacting the victims and give them information . 
  that is our priority . 
  reporter : did the police patrol loose the suspect or did they follow him ? 
   chief : yes , they lost him and he was only found later again . 
  reporter : did the attacker have a german id on him ? 
   chief . 
  uh , i do n't know . 
  i ca n't say , it 's subject to ongoing investigation . 
  reporter : you said he was a german-iranian , so he had dual citizenship ? 
  so it was not a refugee ? 
   chief : yes , this is certain . 
  reporter : [ inaudible ]  chief : we can say right now only that it began at 17:50 and that we found the suspect dead at 20:30 . 
  reporter : in the video ( parkinglot ) apparently he is talking , can you confirm that ? 
   chief : we are currently investigating this and also asked the population for their media of the event . 
  it is not sure entirely who screamed what , so we ca n't make definite statements on who said what . 
  reporter : can you say something on the perpetrator 's life ? 
   chief : not at this point . 
  reporter : can you confirm the authenticity of the parking lot video ? 
   chief : yes , this is what we currently assume , that there was interaction with the perpetrator . 
  reporter : were there asian victims ? 
   chief : we do n't know at this point . 
  reporter : [ inaudible ]  chief : there is nothing indicating that we should feel insecure in the coming days - but we have to be very clear , that there never is 100 % security . 
  at this point there is no indications to feel unsafe because of this situation , or hide away . 
  reporter : comparisons to wurzburg ? 
   chief : we do n't see similarities at this point . 
  reporter : there is a profile on facebook where a woman asks people to go to owz mc-donalds for 16:00 because she will give away food . 
   chief : well this is one part of the investigations that will have to be conducted . 
  our main focus in the past hours was to ** make sure that there is no more armed perpetrator in the city . 
  only after this was clear , we could really approach the crime scene and start proper investigations ** . 
  reporter : was the newly formed terrorism unit ( bfe - anti-terror unit of federal police ) used ? 
   chief : no , but we used gsg-9 . 
  but i have to say that we have to praise the engagement and resolve of our officers . 
  the number of 2.300 officers is a strong signal of the potential we could work with . 
  all states immediately offered support . 
  in a situation like this , this is very helpful to be able to rely on even more forces . 
  reporter : [ inaudbile ] on media  chief : we already received some media and expect a fair number of videos to be provided for us . 
  videos and pictures will help to reconstruct what exactly happened . 
  we will of course also ask all the witnesses and finnish the interviews tomorrow morning . 
  reporter : [ inaudible ]  chief : tomorrow , at 11:30 we will probably give another update . 
  reporter : amount of emergency ( `` 911 '' ) calls ? 
   chief : we do not know . 
  reporter : can you guess ? 
   press officer : ** you know our stance on guessing !, 
  ** reporter : amount of wrong reports ? 
   chief : do n't know the exact number . 
  but we do n't say wrong reports - we get information and we have to check it out . 
  thank god all turned out to be not factual , but i ca n't tell how many people called us . 
  reporter : nationality of suspect ? 
   chief : german and iranian nationality . 
  reporter : officers injured ? 
   chief : no , ** maybe one cracked his ankle a bit ** , but we have no reports of injuries . 
  reporter : where was the suspect found exactly ? 
   chief : he was not found at isar , that is a wrong report that we got . 
  he was found near the mall in a side-street . 
  reporter : did he get to the scene by car ? 
   chief : we will get to this , but we ca n't say right now . 
  all of this has to be found out via 3rd parties because we ca n't ask the suspect as he is dead , this makes it more complicated . 
  reporter : where did he get the gun ? 
   chief : we do n't know yet . 
  reporter : people in danger of life still ? 
   chief : ** 3 seriously injured , in danger of life . 
  13 lightly injured ** . 
  reporter : [ inaudible ]  chief : this is part of the investigations how the perpetrator proceeeded inside the mall and the restaurant . 
  we are sure to have enough video evidence to reconstruct what happened exactly . 
  reporter motive ? 
   chief : of course we begin in his personal surroundings , find out what it is and start investigating . 
  there are starting points because we have his identity already . 
  reporter : surprised about 16 wounded , 9 dead , why so many dead because in other shootings there are more wounded . 
   chief : depends on shooter 's ability to shoot , the distance and where people get hit . 
  ** this is not a movie ** . 
  if you are hit today , you are seriously hurt . 
  if you are hit in the upper body or in the head , it is very likely you are lethally injured . 
  this is a question about distance and skill , then ammunition comes after reporter : hurt children ? 
   chief : yes . 
  reporter : dead children ? 
   chief if you take it according to the law * ( children = below-18 ) * , yes , there are youths among the dead . 
  reporter : can you elaborate ? 
   chief : please have respect for the dead . 
  but yes , there are youths under the wounded and the dead . 
  reporter : can i ask about the perpetrator again ? 
  was he educated , any further information ? 
   chief : no , not at this point . 
  i tried to explain that we have to find his contact persons first before we can answer such questions , if he has worked , studied , et cetera . 
  those people have to be found and questioned . 
  reporter : is it terror attack or rampage ? 
   chief : we are dealing with a shooting . 
  wether it 's a terrorist attack or a rampage is about the motive , this will be concluded in the investigations . 
  it would be ** unprofessional to conclude things at this point ** . 
  ** no more questions . 
  ** ** press officer **  our thoughts and prayers are with the victims , but also the civil society of this city , who we can tell . 
  we have found the problem , we can look forward , tomorrow can begin , and we are happy to be able to make this statement . 
  sure , i can agree to that  have a good night . 
  yes but if you just shoot yourself in a park it 's something different though , no ? 
  that does n't change the question i asked . 
  let us wait for a couple of days . 
  you are jumping to conclusions . 
  but of course you will never change your narrative despite what it turns out to be . 
  you 'll just blame the media and it all being a massive conspiracy . 
  ( should i bet 500 $ on it ?
