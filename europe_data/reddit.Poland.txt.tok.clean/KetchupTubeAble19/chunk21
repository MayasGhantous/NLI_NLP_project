  ** where is the proof that they are ? 
  ** look at the video of the balcony man . 
  look at the transcripts . 
  look at the videos and the images of the guy . 
  he committed suicide , this does n't get you 72 virgins . 
  wait two days , i will not speculate , but i will call you out on your hypocrisy when you do n't deliver . . 
  yep , so who are you donate your 500 dollars to ? 
  there is not ** one ** police source stating that it is islamic terrorism . 
  the very video linked mentions terrorism but makes no conclusion as to which kind . 
  also they removed the statement from your link . 
  * what do you say now , looking forward to your reply !!, 
  the guy swearing about foreigners was actually one of the balcony people . 
  this made the shooter explain that he is in fact german . 
  you are right , sorry . 
  i was n't sure how to phrase the whole thing , so went ahead with his name and general wording from wiki intro . 
  it might , but too early to tell . 
  too much speculation . 
   astonishing amount of twitter `` gutmenschen '' incl . 
  high profile politicians i only heard of k\u00fcnast . 
  who are the other `` high profile politicians '' ? 
  i do n't see pity for the attacker anywhere . 
  wanting him for questioning does n't mean you pity him . 
  many prominent green party members ( like g\u00f6ring-eckart ) have critisied k\u00fcnast for her tweet . 
  so please enlighten me . 
  well yeah , but renate k\u00fcnast is renate k\u00fcnast . 
  ** this is done with every incident ** !, 
  it does n't matter how right you were , there will always be an official investigation , and the officer gets a leave and psychological care . 
  german law also treats ** every single shot ** as an administrative act on its own . 
  yeah would be nice to have a combined eu score to have comparable population sizes . 
  but does n't work because we do n't have unified policies in that regard . 
  you clearly know nothing about freeriding . 
  probably automated . 
  i 100 % agree that rt sucks most of the time , but their live coverage service is a nice thing and the source/uploader does not matter in those cases . 
  looking at it again , i think 10 is kopenhagen . 
  but i added the rest , cheers, 
  nice find , added . 
  wow nice !, 
  i sorted them to have a nice guessing game  i found it quite hard to guess , please help me . 
   their ideology was banned though and its not as if they were a effective fighting force despite the fact that there plenty of former ssers around with lots of combat experience . 
  because their cause ceased to exist . 
  hitler dead , germany occupied . 
  our propaganda made clear that there is only victory or total defeat . 
  and total defeat happened . 
  an ss-soldier had name , rank , training , chain of command , strict hierarchy , ideological indoctrination . 
  this can never work with isis . 
  an is soldier can be anyone who is crazy enough to belive going outside and killing some guys with a knife will make up for his miserable life so far . 
  he has no nationality , no actual chain of command , no training and not even a lot of ideological training . 
  is should be seen like an international ideological mafia with an attractive internet meme that draws people into their arms ( that is for the non-syrian non-territorial isis of course ) . 
  again my point :  it 's about the harshest possible punishment for the perpetrators , but it 's also about making sure that the factors that radicalise people are being addressed , for example by letting ex-radicals teach new ones how fucked up their ideology is , having warning systems in place with family , mosques , social services and police , and so on and so forth . 
  would you not want to have that ? 
  but that guy was not an islamist , not even a muslim . 
  he was on drugs and jibber-jabbering weird shit . 
  he was barefoot because he felt `` heat and bugs '' at his feet and his grandparents had previously tried to get him into a psychological clinic . 
  he was on the way to portugal apparently , with 10 $ in his pockets and going in the wrong direction . 
   you have no place here ( or anywhere else for that matter ) no you do n't . 
  i also did n't say we should prevent people from dying . 
  i said we should prevent people from joining isis . 
   we did the same thing after wwii with people in the ss and that worked rather well . 
  haha , read up on how many ss still had a place in post-war society . 
  bad example . 
   we do n't need to understand , dig for motives , we need to react , punish ( take away rights , personal and legal ) , extradite , etc. 
  understanding and knowing your enemy is key in combating him . 
  taking only the approach you suggested will create more is followers than it removes . 
  it 's about the harshest possible punishment for the perpetrators , but it 's also about making sure that the factors that radicalise people are being addressed , for example by letting ex-radicals teach new ones how fucked up their ideology is , having warning systems in place with family , mosques , social services and police , and so on and so forth . 
  would you not want to have that ? 
  typical , how did i even remotely say it was an excuse ? 
  if you murder someone because he called you a dick you will still be convicted for murder . 
  same here . 
  but understanding motivations and radicalisation is important for combating it . 
  latest in german news is that he got news of a friend of him being killed in afghanistan and then apparently radicalized within a couple of days . 
  what are your sources ? 
  would like to use your points but ca n't refer to `` some guy on reddit '' as a source . 
  great , what is your argument ? 
  public-law broadcasting institutions in germany means broadcasters , which are not privately owned and are not governmental radio or tv . 
  ard is not ` owned by ' anybody , particularly not by `` germany '' ( meaning its government/federal state ) . 
  ard-members like br ( bayerischer rundfunk ) are not owned by their land ( state and its government , here bavaria ) , either . 
  with the rundfunkfreiheit ( freedom of broadcasting ) , they have an independent position ( within a legal framework ) . 
  this is what i asked about regarding the french situation , but i guess you do n't know , otherwise you would not be sending irrelevant messages . 
  i asked about state control of state-owned media . 
  what influence can the government have over their media ? 
  in germany it is quite restricted , i assume it is the same in france . 
  so ownership by a corporation or a murdoch-person would be worse than state-funded media . 
  i know about the housing situation . 
  in fact , i live in aarhus and am desperately looking for accomodation  thank you for your elaborations . 
  however , i still would disagree about the priorities . 
  are normal refugees not placed in asylum centers in denmark ? 
  there are 3 stages in germany to bring refugees from camps to centers to normal housing . 
  this often only works with the help of the civil society . 
  if we look at the jihadis , who are in all ( ? ), 
  cases danish citizens , they will not have the same prerequisites as refugees , will they ? 
  so they will get the standard danish social support ( what ever that might be ) . 
  so i am not entirely sure how these two are comparable in the way you describe it . 
  on top of that , the success of the program is mostly about people * not even going to syria * :  since the initial exodus of young people , very few have left from aarhus for syria , even when traffic from the rest of europe was spiking . 
  last year , in 2015 , it was just one person . 
  no account that i found on the web mentions anything more than mentoring . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33344898 * an extensive network including parents , social workers , teachers , youth club workers , outreach workers and the police may raise the alarm about a young person who is being radicalised . 
  * individual counselling is provided for people who intend to travel to syria , and in some cases a mentor is assigned . 
  parents of these people take part in self-help groups . 
  * there is support for families to create networks that support each other , which has a ripple effect in terms of weakening radicals ' resolve * `` but this is not a get-out-of-jail-free card , '' the commissioner says . 
  `` if we think we have reason to believe they have committed crimes , we will investigate and prosecute . '' * the most important component of the aarhus process , all involved agree , is its use of individual mentors , to whom the would-be or returning fighter can turn for ** both practical , day-to-day help and serious religious and moral debate ** .
