  ( `` i can , and do , help with homework , applications , practical stuff like that . 
  but we also talk , a lot -- about religion , islam , free speech , politics , international relations . 
  serious , philosophical , intellectual conversations , twice a week for two , three hours . '' ), 
  * the mayor about grimhojvej mosque : `` we needed , as a city , to make it very clear to the religious community that if it is not a part of the solution , it is a part of the problem , '' he says . 
  `` there had to be a real , a serious dialogue , and they had to actively start discouraging people from travelling . 
  we said if they were n't prepared to do that , we would wind up the pressure , including legally , and we would do it very publicly , out in the open , and in the media . '' in aarhus , half a dozen returnees needed no further help . 
  another 10 have received varying degrees of help , with half being back in school and the rest at work or looking for work . 
  the last 3 needed more sustained help , to extract themselves from an environment of which they no longer want to be a part . 
  for them , the exit programme is effectively tailor-made ; two are even being helped to move away from city altogether .

  we ca n't prosecute without evidence . 
  and then these people would just be floating around , a potential danger . 
  which would you rather ? '' so , what do you think ? 
  is n't this better than doing nothing ? 
  this is common sense in many other areas already ( like drugs et cetera ) , and yes , it costs money . 
  but a strong and resilient civil society where actors work together is worth a lot in my eyes . 
  so you admit you do n't have an actual source on your statements ? 
  helping to find an apartment can just as well be that you show them the ways to proper housing that they can afford ( with the normal state benefits ? 
  ) , give guarantees to the landlords , help with contracts , and so on . 
   they made it clear to citizens of denmark who had traveled to syria that they were welcome to come home , and that when they did , they would ** receive help with going back to school , finding an apartment , meeting with a psychiatrist or a mentor , or whatever they needed to fully integrate back into society ** . 
  is there any source for the preferential housing assignment ? 
  did n't read it in the article . 
  it was all over german media . 
  i do n't know if you read correctly , i was rooting for france . 
  the hint at the iceland-karma thing was more of a joke that they jinxed it by using it . 
   kissing one of the victims and licking her on her face against her will, 
  is n't tim wise the guy from werder bremen ? 
  congratulations to portugal . 
  i was rooting for france , but i think copying the iceland-hu in the semifinal was bad karma because it was so cringy . 
  / edit : to the ones saying it was there before : yes , but undoubtably the use in the semi-finals was inspired by this iceland in this cup . 
  you should read some history books . 
  oh wow , being against colonialism is now -10 karma on / r/europe , nice . 
  ^ this . 
  also , flooding the african markets with cheap european produce ( esp . 
  food ) is not going to help . 
  forcing sudden and complete market liberalisation on those countries just does n't work out . 
  i think our good environmental standards and healthy societies will pay off in the long run . 
  imagine all the work that china and other rising nations will have to invest in cleaning their country from the pollution that the industrialisation has created . 
  not triggered , but it played a part because many people who worked in agriculture lost their jobs and moved to the cities . 
  i think the eu works to preserving just that :  the union shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity , and [ ... ] ensure that europe 's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced '' . 
  i did n't know he awas an alleged fascist , so i learned something  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gianluigi_buffon#controversy, 
  well shit , did n't know that . 
  he seemed like a nice guy imo , 
  [ eu citizens abroad have the right to seek help from another eu country 's diplomatic representation when their home country does not have an embassy or a consulate able to help them ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/citizen/news/150420_en.htm ), 
  buffon is a great man , professionally and personally . 
  try german education on ww2, 
  i think this is a fair statement , nothing special or evil about it . 
  i hope they keep their promises about that political reflection on the eu . 
  here 's hoping the uk end their political crisis soon and we get an agreement sooner rather than later . 
  if it involves the single market , they better make sure to fund more education , invest in their peripheries and conduct other programs to get people off the xenophobia train that we have seen . 
  try out dresden public transport on mondays . 
  that is ridiculous, 
  thanks !, 
  can you elaborate or eli5 on this ? 
  thanks, 
  but why would the media ( or big parts of it ) make everyone vote for brexit and then do a 180 turn after ? 
  just for the drama ? 
  they already suspended lots of stuff for the swiss . 
  if they change their law all treaties will be void . 
  on phone so cant give a source but check wikipedia for eu-swiss relations . 
  well for one thing , the deal from february is off the table already :  as agreed , the `` new settlement for the united kingdom within the european union '' , reached at the european council on 18-19 february 2016 , will now not take effect and ceases to exist . 
  there will be no renegotiation . 
   a ) no we did n't . 
  we voted out if the eu . 
  there are options that keep free movement of people , as shown by norway and switzerland . 
  which directly contradicts what most of the people who voted leave wanted to happen in the first place ? 
  - they voted leave in order to ** not ** have : payment to eu ; imposed eu regulations ; freedom of movement, 
  more power to the parliament !, 
   the european economic area ( eea ) is the area in which the agreement on the eea provides for the ** free movement of persons , goods , services and capital ** within the internal market . 
  the eea agreement specifies that membership is open to member states of either the european union or european free trade association ( efta ) . 
  efta states which are party to the eea agreement participate in the eu 's internal market without being members of the eu . 
  they ** adopt most eu legislation concerning the single market ** that is what we talk about here . 
  and the uk will have to agree on adopting the very eu legislation that they used in their arguments for leaving . 
  do n't make it sound like the eu is being unreasonable here . 
  what is your point ? 
  trade is going to happen , yes , but if they want the single market , they are going to have to adopt the eu legislation and freedom of movement . 
       sarcasm aside if eu will throw feet over uk then it will send a message . 
  that eu is n't union of nations who work together to build new tomorrow but union of few powerful nations that cheat and lie getting new members and when they want to leave they take a gun to their temples saying `` or else '' . 
  how is the eu possibly doing that ? 
  everyone today said they accept the votum and that it is time to strike a deal that minimises losses for both the uk and europe . 
  it is the argument of some of the leave campaigners , that the uk should retain all their benefits ( access to single market ) without the other things that come along with it ( such as freedom of movement ) . 
  and that is simply not going to happen . 
  this is not bullying , this is not cheating and lying . 
  holding the uk to the same standards as everyone else is simply rule of law and common sense . 
   calm and a amicable divorce will be the best for all . 
  yeps , but this talk about not initiating article 50 until they solved their party business is unacceptable for all of us . 
  the uncertainty is eating $ $ $ as we speak . 
  no time for these games really . 
  just the total , absolute numbers count . 
  wanted to check the first results to confirm that remain was winning , but unfortunately have been hocked to my screen ever since and have to go to work in 4 hours ... 
  why ? 
  he did n't use a proper gun , just a gas pistol , probably with cs cartridges . 
  the eastern campaigns , one of mankind 's darkest chapters . 
  good speech that debunks some common myths from both sides , especially the trade part and passporting was very enlightening . 
  great work , i think you should x-post your translation to / r/unitedkingdom or / r/ukpolitics  / edit : oh , and maybe some formatting, 
  the graph says : if you live in areas that have more immigrants/foreigners you are less likely to vote for hofer . 
  if you live in areas that have little to no foreigners , you are more likely to vote for him . 
  which is ironic . 
  should n't the ones that `` have to face '' the foreigners be more opposed to immigration huh ? 
  - 150 people present - 30-40 shots fired - several dead and wounded hardly `` local news '' then , is it ?
