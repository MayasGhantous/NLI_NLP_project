  it 's all over national news in germany . 
  that is not even close to what i said . . 
   just pull all their funding . 
  ... causing even more terrorists to come when tunisia becomes a failed state . 
  i can understand very well why they do n't want to have these sorts of people back in their own countries or prisons , radicalising others and being a significant threat to a very fragile democracy . 
  the scale of the attacks is different . 
  the type of attack was neither new nor surprising . 
  the ` blitzkrieg ' was kind of stopped outside dunkirk though because hitler & rundstedt got cold feet . 
  it 's reported on the front page of major german outlets http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/schiesserei-in-finnland-drei-frauen-in-imatra-erschossen-a-1124349.html, 
  ( 1 ) - fair enough ( 2 ) - fair enough ( 3 ) - fair enough ( 4 ) - fair enough ( 5 ) - fair enough ( 6 ) - what do you mean by that ? 
  continue with current policies as if nothing happened ? 
  i am not sure if that is possible , looks like a lot of confusion going around and trying to dodge the single-market question . 
  ( 7 ) - fair enough ( 8 ) - fair enough seems pretty okay to me , except the market thing . 
  but certainly this will not be what the uk aims for is it ? 
  what tells you that it 's going to be gabriel ? 
  i 'm still hoping for schultz . 
  thanks !, 
  do you have more info or a source for the podemos thingy ? 
  first time i hear of that . 
  cheers !, 
  since this came up in some other threads , i thought it was worth discussing . 
  german media seems to be very focused on other issues at the moment . 
  compared to the national election last september , the attention the eu election gets is ridiculously low . 
  i want to stress that i do n't have some conspiracy-kind of explanation for this . 
  is it the same in your country ?

  i thought this would be quite interesting ... 
  the few french friends i have are going mad with the front national getting 25 % . 
  meanwhile , a leftist german friend is praising greece : `` 28 % in griechenland . 
  ( 28 % in greece - that rocks ! ), 
  ( saw lucke ( leader of ger eurosceptics ) talk for five seconds on tv and i already want to throw up ) . 
  i guess there will be more over the course of the evening . 
  what are your friends and peers posting ? 
  i guess only a small minority are concerned with it . 
  99 % are busy with posting irrelevant stuff and pictures of their lifes - so please share the interesting things on reddit . 
  match thread 30 min before the match on / r/worldcup and / r/soccer * [ reddit stream for first match thread ( gre - col ) 18:00 - 0:3 ] ( http://reddit-stream.com/comments/284pz5/ ) * [ reddit stream for second match thread ( uru - crc ) 21:00 - 1:3 ] ( http://reddit-stream.com/comments/285393/ ) * [ reddit stream for third match thread ( italy - england ) 00:00 - 2:1 ] ( http://reddit-stream.com/comments/285hym/ ) in germany they exceeded the usual loudness-limit of 22:00 h to be valid until later when germany plays later . 
  but i think most german games are early anyways . 
  team preview : [ germany ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/26ycoz/world_cup_2014_team_preview_2532_group_g_germany/ ) -- [ portugal ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/270zwf/world_cup_2014_team_preview_2632_group_g_portugal/ ) who do you want to win ? 
  who do you think will win ? 
  where and how are you watching the match ? 
  / edit : holy shit , 3:0 on halftime break . 
  i hope you get what i mean . 
  for example , i lived in denmark for half a year and there was some stuff i 'd have preffered to have known beforehand ( such as : never question their welfare state ! ), 
  on stuff that you usually do and do not do . 
  hey / r/europe i thought it would be a nice challenge to have a thread where everybody just speaks their ** own native language ** only or any other european language he can speak ( apart from english , i 'd say , to avoid everyone using it ( uk/ireland people may of course use it since it is their native language . 
  ** rules ** * you may translate stuff you understand from another language into your own so that others from your language group can understand it . 
  * you may not translate stuff from your own ** native ** language into another . 
  * if it is not clear by your flair , please state the language you speak in your post . 
  * please do not use google translate ( if you do , do n't post the translation please ) . 
  self-made translations only . 
  let 's see if we can find someone who is not understood by anyone else in this subreddit when he speaks his native language  list of european languages : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_languages#number_of_speakers, 
  i found these photographs in / r/combatfootage , made by / u/babywookie . 
  i have the feeling that almost nobody is aware what it actually means when you hear about `` fighting in ukraine '' in the news . 
  seeing these pictures made me more aware than before as to what it actually means to have war on european soil again . 
  please stay respectful in the comments . 
  bride is german , groom is italian ( sicily ) , wedding is in switzerland . 
  clash of traditions ? 
  what 's it gon na be ?
