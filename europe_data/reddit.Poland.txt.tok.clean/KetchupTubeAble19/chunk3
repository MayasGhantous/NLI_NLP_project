  and in this case , this is being defended by people who consider their culture superior and are proud of our ` civilization ' . 
  this thread will go places . 
  bad places . 
  we backed you against italy !, 
  do n't betray us over a coin . 
  it 's not our fault you put rooney in the game . 
  too bad when the whole world sees you grow up and then hates you  i call it the ` bieber-effect ' ... 
  yes , 
  oh , all germans cheered for you when you beat spain :'(, 
  haha , is that why you have a bavarian flair ? 
  what 's your home university / home country ? 
  what other german options do you have ? 
  dk , you ( if you went ) ? 
  ronaldo man , [ even looks in the camera when diving ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ochcq56es ), 
  my visa credit card is free of additional fees and gives out money at any atm world wide for the actual exchange rate . 
  before erasmus : german - european after erasmus : european - german, 
  the best in-depth , unbiased and well-informing german news source imo is the ` deutschlandfunk ' - [ dradio.de ] ( http://www.deutschlandradio.de ) - [ deutschlandfunk ] ( http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/ ) - [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/deutschlandfunk?fref=ts ) it usually does n't get that much attention , many people do n't listen to radio anymore , but their web presence and social media ( facebook ) is pretty damn good . 
  that is true , however , many nazis in high positions ( that did some serious shit ) were put into high positions after the war . 
  this is contested since sometimes there was simply nobody else left to do the job . 
  many nazis in many relevant positions after 1945 . 
  pretty small . 
  but they have a significant community in my town of 80.000 . 
  heck , my favourite hairdresser alone ( who is portuguese ) can mobilize 200 fans :p, 
  actually , i personally would not mind if the us would become more relevant in international football . 
  would be funny if they pass the group in brazil . 
   let 's keep that cesspit for dumb american teenagers , shall we ? 
  ftfy . 
  also , world cup time is / r/yurop time . 
  until brazil wins it . 
  well in my city , no matter which nation wins , there 's always a celebration afterwards that can be quite loud . 
  ( the smaller the nation , the louder the celebration in germany ), 
  that 's what this thread is for , 
  liechtenstein or vatican . 
  filthy banks and filthy priests . 
  we should get some football into this subreddit during the worldcup . 
  let 's face it - the majority of people like watching it and / r/soccer is full of americans , 
  comments below the article : - ah , cool !, 
  this means germany gets proper attack helicopters for the first time in history . 
  [ e : this is wrong since the apaches will still be under command of the dutch air force ] - finally the bundeswehr has offensive capabilities after 60 years now . 
  welcome back !, 
  - we had this whole blabla 25 years ago already with the german-french brigade - and what happened to that ? 
  the only reason the dutch are doing this is because of their drug policies . . 
  . . they will simply bypass you and come through andorra, 
  if you have a guy on a party that just keeps complaining how shit the party is - at some point you will want him to leave the party . 
  i think this is the mechanism at hand . 
  add some special rules and exceptions for the uk and you pretty much have the reasoning why people are a bit pissed with the uk . 
  great review , thanks !, 
  those are minor . 
  and the uk has opposed tougher rules to protect the london city . 
  watch inside job . 
  germany you have catholic and protestant lessons in school . 
  some states also have islam now . 
  i had to take one of those until we were able to choose the subject ` ethics ' which was much better ( going from 10th grade ) we discussed kant , rawls and others while the other students in ` catholic religion ' were busy doing esoteric dances and creating massage oils . 
  separation of state and church is not a reality in germany unfortunately . 
  ** translation ** ** eu-summit ** * cameron warned merkel he can not guarantee that the uk remains in the eu when the heads of state support juncker 's presidency . 
  * if they do , it might destabilize it 's government so much that a referendum on the eu must be done sooner than planned . 
  * european parliament has nominated juncker . 
  now it is up to the heads of states and governments . 
  * cameron on juncker : `` a face of the 80s can not solve the problems of the coming five years '' * meanwhile , german eurosceptic party afd tries to join tory-faction in the euparl . 
  who ? 
  erdogan or \u00d6zdemir ? 
  sure , that 's why i stressed that * one person * can live by that `` normally '' . 
  i am a student , so it 's different ofc . 
  my health insurance comes with the family , other insurances as well , etc. . 
  when i said i have much less , it included all that . 
  of course i get support from my parents and i have 2 jobs next to being full-time student . 
  what is left after rent , internet , electricity , water , gez , phonebill etc. 
  is enough for booze and holidays . 
  that was my point . 
  i ride a bike . 
  daaamn , 980 $ , i wish i was as poor as that . 
  one person can live by that perfectly fine in germany imo . 
  i have much less as a student and it 's enough for stuff , booze and holidays . 
  and i live in the most expensive part . 
  exactly . 
  how can the countries that are in the worst economic condition deal with the huge amount of refugees without relying on the help of the other member states ? 
  it 's ridiculous and everybody knows it . 
  we need legal processes and equal distribution among member states . 
  regarding your edit : i was just googling hidden champions and mittelstand . 
  first thing that came up basically . 
   no , you are thinking of the chicken tax thing : http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb125357990638429655?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle%2fsb125357990638429655.html     it effects vans . 
  otherwise we get cars from everywhere . 
  / u/shoryukenist has already answered to that , i made clear enough that i wasnt sure . 
  right . 
  but wait for the people screaming ` but crysis !, 
  and anno ! '', 
   if you see blames put on immigrants , they are there for a good reason , regardless of your version of reality . 
   if you see blames put on ~ ~ immigrants ~ ~ jews , they are there for a good reason , regardless of your version of reality . 
  realize something ? 
  no shit i was n't even aiming for `` did nazi that coming '' joke . . 
  sorry if you got it wrong . 
  quite new to reddit . 
   as for the actual discussion , i actually believe that applies to the whole planet . 
  call me a radical leftist , but i 'm strongly opposed to big capital , big wealth , big countries , big corporations , big banks . 
  in my view , it just begs for trouble and bullying around . 
  if everyone has a more equal footing , the benefits would be immense . 
  well in that case we have nothing to disagree on . 
  hm , i ca n't see that complex to be honest . 
  and the article itself is from an american/canadian perspective . 
  but thanks for clearing that up .
