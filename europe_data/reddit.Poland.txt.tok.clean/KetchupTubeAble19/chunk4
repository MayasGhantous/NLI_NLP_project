  jaja , nazi that coming . 
  honestly no reason to insult and downvote me . 
  you seem to be more obsessed with my flair than the content i wrote . 
  i did not post the article because it reflects my opinion or anything . 
  i do n't even disagree with you . 
  but coming from a discussion on the nature of german companies to your reasoning about germany being too big too fail is really not a thought that would not have crossed my mind after reading this . 
  wow , i did not see that coming . 
  interesting point , though it feels a bit paranoid to me ( ? ) . 
  would be interesting to see what others have to say on this matter . 
  dunno , i just meant that they are not any nicer in germany . 
  just that germany has different standards on some issues , strong unions etc. 
  what do you mean hungary ? 
  oh of course they do . 
  they even do it inside germany obviously . 
  yeah well . 
  i think us does n't allow cars in if they are not made in the us or something . 
  of course ( sadly enough ) they will ` exploit ' the system at hand . 
  we had tons of companies moving production to china , even worse in that regard . 
  well if you are the guy who builds and invents the machines that build the automation machines , you are certainly on the right side :p unless someone builds a machine that builds the machines that build the automation machines . 
  and so on . 
  yes that is a huge problem . 
  social mobility in germany is not as high as it should be , but at least the education is basically free . 
  i studied with some americans , all of which are in debt with some tens of thousands of dollars they had to take in loans to be able to study . 
  with automation becoming big , a highly educated society is the only way to escape massive problems until a new system is in place . 
  german ( small and medium ) companies are quite big in producing assembly-line machines and industrial machines as well as in sub-supplier roles . 
  the products that are used and known by the masses ( computers , mobile phones , . . ) are coming from elsewhere , with the car industry being kind of an exception . 
  you own a mercedes , but you do n't know how many companies are actually taking part in making one car , specialization is extremely high here . 
  you ca n't automate the process of inventing new machines . 
  i think this is what is being referred to here . 
  [ presentation ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/venohr/german-mittelstand-champions-geschtzt ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hidden_champions, 
  9 % of uk people voted ukip . 
  not much better . 
  it is very common . 
  i switched to telegram though , since it has not been bought by a major company ( yet ) and has many nice features , such as a desktop version . 
  if there is more immigration , our government must ensure that the funds that go into integration ( language courses , education , immigration administration ) are boosted as well . 
  i moved to denmark and the administration regarding immigration is much better than in germany . 
  highly responsive , they all speak more than danish , they help you , you can communicate easily and you get free danish courses . 
  and surprise , i see a lot of immigrants and refugees here but i never feel threatened . 
  they all seem to fit in . 
  i never had any problems . 
  still , danes voted the far right as biggest party in the euparl . 
  major problem is still the poverty of immigrants as opposed to the relative wealth of the population . 
  this causes lesser education for the immigrants , more crime and , as a result , more hatred and prejudice against them . 
  nice video , until in the end all those weird websites kept popping up . 
  tuna independence party got quite a big share of them . 
  far left is killing the economy . 
  ` far right ' is killing people . 
  ( yes , i exaggerate . 
  but the reason why many people deem far left less dangerous is because they do n't hop on the nationalistic and xenophobic bandwagon , which i find more dangerous than crazy theories in economy . 
  different far-right parties are different all over europe , the same goes for the left ones . 
  the only major victory for them ( lefties ) was greece i suppose . 
  on the contrary , you have ` far-right ' winning elections in denmark , uk , france and getting very strong in countries like austria , poland , hungary , ... ), 
  ah , so there is another party in denmark who is right of the df ? 
  ye , pretty disappointed by the results they got . 
  i did n't know  cheers . 
  well , the stream had like 12 viewers throughout the evening . . :d, 
  yes , but anti-eu , anti-immigration , patriotic on a danish level of politics . 
  this means they are still less hardcore than fn in the eu , but equally far-right in the subset of danish politics . 
  btw , german afd ( eurosceptics ) also said they would not cooperate with ukip and fn . 
  ah , secret agreement to split germany ? 
  on sept. 1 , 2019 , french tanks will roll into germany . 
  uh , it was removed altogether . 
  the german parliament wanted it to be 3 % . 
  for eu small parties went to court and it decided in their favour . 
  in last year 's federal election , 15,7 % of the votes did not find their way to parliamentary representation due to the 5 % threshold on national elections . 
  i hope it will get reduced to ~ 3 % . 
  dansk folkeparti is not as bad as front national . 
  but i guess by danish standards , they are equally far right in the country as fn is in france . 
  this information is nothing without the information on the threshold . 
  yea well , but you immediately think it is due to much higher amount of votes , while actually that is not the case . 
  ~ ~ ** misleading thread-title ** ~ ~ ** important information for interpreting this ** the npd has not gained a significantly higher amount of votes . 
  they even got a higher percentage in federal elections . 
  it is only because the threshold was removed ( federal elections min . 
  amount required to enter parliament : 5 % ) . 
  the german eurosceptics got 6,5 % and will gain some seats . 
  this is the actual news . 
  compared to other countries , germany has remained quite pro-european . 
  still better than france , 
  ** france ** far right win election . 
  25 % for the front national . 
  1 % of the people that voted . 
  but yes . 
  germany and austria have first results ( official projections , the actual results might be ~ 0.1 % different in the end ) . 
  what about the other countries ? 
  when is the uk releasing the data ? 
  stations in italy close at 23:00 . 
  stations in denmark close at 20:00 . 
  what about the other countries ? 
  german tv coverage will be back at 22:00 for european results . 
  _______________________________________________ european parliament youtube channel livestream : ( first link ) `` live streaming is not possible in germany due to legal issues - we are sorry '' . 
  can you elaborate on those measures in mass surveillance ? 
  i hope we get the others stickied as well  germany was pretty early with stations closing at 18:00 . 
  i know , still , more votes would have strengthened the relevant agenda in the other european parties . 
  yes i agree . 
  i should have phrased my point differently . 
  but it is my personal stand on it :d, 
  tak , 
  no , i did n't see any df posters destroyed - just the others . 
  polls close at 20:00 i guess ? 
  election threshold was abolished .
