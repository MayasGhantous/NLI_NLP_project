  rest is as follows : * fw 1,4 % - independent voters - ( 1 seat ) * piraten 1,3 % - pirates - ( 1 seat ) * tierschutz 1,1 % - animal protection party - ( 1 seat ) * npd 0,8 % - the nazis - ( 1 seat . ), 
  / edit : satirical party `` die partei '' is on the brink on getting a mandate . 
  0,5 % right now . 
  with 96 seats to win , approx . 
  0.5021 - 0.6 % for a party are enough for the first seat . 
  because of the sad smiley ? 
  well , the issues the pirates address are very important for me , so i am sad that people care more about animals ( whose rights are supported by many other parties ) or their national socialism than their own privacy , free internet etc. 
   i edited it out now , so that the numbers are free of my bias . 
  ** germany ** 18:48 - second projection released . 
  germany sends 96 meps . 
  this means approx . 
  0.5021 - 0.6 % for a party are enough for the first seat . 
  * union 36,1 % ( cdu 30,5 , csu 5,5 ) - conservatives ( 35 or 36 seats ) * spd 27,3 % - social democrats ( 27 or 28 seats ) * gr\u00fcne 10,6 % - greens ( 11 or 10 seats ) * linke 7,60 % - left ( 8 or 7 seats ) * afd 6,5 % - alternative for germany , eurosceptics ( 6 seats ) ( official statement : not gon na work together with ukip or front national ) * fdp 3,0 % - liberals ( 3 seats ) * fw 1,3 % - independent voters ( 1 seat ) * piraten 1,4 % - pirates ( 1 seat ) * tierschutz 1,1 % - animal protection party ( 1 seat ) * npd 0,9 % - the nazis ( 1 seat ) * die partei 0,5 % - satirical party ( not sure if they get a seat ) * familienpartei 0,8 % - family party ( 1 seat ) * \u00d6dp 0,7 % - ecological party ( 1 seat ) * others : 2 % turnout ** 47,9 % ** ( 2009 : 43,3 % ) - there were local elections in 10 german states , this is probably why the turnout has increased overall . 
  / edit : will update this post . 
  not uncommon really ( for austria ) . 
  i guess conchita has made many people think of austria as very liberal and left ( ish ) :d / / edit : at least more liberal and left than it actually is at the moment . 
  really , df so strong ? 
  i saw quite alot of ads for them here in aarhus ( `` mere denmark , mindre eu , det er muligt '' ) but this has changed - now it 's socialdemokraterne , venstre , radikale venstre , kf and liberals all over the place . 
  also , quite a lot of ads were destroyed and taken down by some people . 
  this is a crime in germany , i guess the same goes for denmark ? 
  / edit : probably typed all the parties wrong . 
  danish is hard . 
  this . 
  same reason why eastern europeans hate russia now and not germany anymore . 
  work up history = have friendly neighbors . 
  deny history = enjoy your problems . 
  i guess it is a bit far-fetched for students to learn so much history , when normally , you do n't have more than 1 - 4 hours of history per week . 
  i was really dissapointed that we dealt with wwii in like 2 history lessons ( 2x 45 mins ) . 
  however , i like the idea . 
  but maybe it should be more individually , as in , each students presents a country for example . 
  we did that sometimes ( i presented slovenia in 6th grade , and still i feel some kind of connection to it every time i see the slovenian flag or read something about it :d ) and i guess it works fine . 
  i reckon your liver is also completely changed ? 
  also , your lungs , maybe ? 
  sad . 
  agreed , i voted pirates in germany . 
  they are irrelevant , but in some state parliaments , they did some good work that was appreciated by the media and even other parties . 
  there was a study , conducted in the us , showing that this increases turnout during elections - that 's why facebook now introduced it i guess . 
  also , today 's google logo is eu-related . 
  nice of them ( to say at least something good about the two biggest evil corporations on the internet ), 
  http://euobserver.com/ that might do . 
  not a big deal imo . 
  it 's the worst german tabloid , the readers ca n't be attracted by any proper arguments . 
  so playing the german card here is good tactics . 
  everybody knows that schulz is opposing berlin dictatorship . 
  well the fact that i oppose racism shows that i know my history right ? 
  germany talks about his history more and more open than almost any other country in this world . 
  actually it is one of the few things that i am patriotic about :d, 
  fully agree . 
  also , funny voting battle going on . 
  when i read stuff like that , as a german , i like replacing `` gypsies '' `` immigrants '' `` romanians '' ( . . ) with `` jews '' and read it again . 
  the result is quite scary more often than it should be . 
  to respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority . ) . 
  hate speech may be punishable if against segments of the population and in a manner that is capable of disturbing the public peace ( section 130 [ agitation of the people ] ) , including racist agitation and antisemitism .

  yes , w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk  usually , every police officer is armed with a pistol .

  you should calm down with your comments .

  the european doctor circlejerk : * romanian doctors go to poland ( e : okay they dont . . ) * polish doctors go to germany * german doctors go to switzerland, 
  in germany voting on sunday gives the conservatives more votes because the people who go to church vote afterwards and the others are too lazy , 
  i voted for them . 
  only party to trust in civil rights issues , transparency and internet policies . 
  it is like a piece of wood swimming in the water . 
  if you put your hand on it , it will go deeper into the water . 
  if you let your hand go , it will raise again . 
  the continents are swimming on the fluids underneath , so that analogy describes it quite well . 
  yep yep . 
  dead serious . 
  who needs a satirical show if the parties do it themselves . . 
  well this is completely normal . 
  there is actually nothing satirical about that spot , it is quite common in german politics .

  yeah but what would they gain ? 
  i do n't think there is a majority in russia or in russian administration for any armed conflict with european union / nato countries . 
  this whole military power talk that has been going on in reddit over the past weeks is batshit insane . 
  net neutrality , civil rights , more democratic and transparent eu , consumer protection , fight against disenchantment with eu . 
  transatlantic trade agreement without giving in on eu consumer protection standards . 
  die partei has a clear position when it comes to europe . 
   yes to europe , no to europe !, 
  done in germany . 
  i also considered some other parties , but i felt like they can not really be trusted in that matter . 
  my bet is that strong pirates can push the other parties in the right direction .
