  i think alde and greens are also strongly pro-neutrality . 
  yes .

  or else : [ - literally hitler ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kica_0lnrsw ) and [ voteman comes for you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt4lherdz8s ) https://www.myvote2014.eu/en/your-vote/cast-vote just follow your media , look at the parties and see what fits you the most . 
  in / r/europe you can also find plenty of information , for example all the debates and latest developments . 
  yesterday 's debate : http://www.elections2014.eu/presidential-debate/en, 
  she 's german stereotype , 
  german web-livestream . 
  phoenix . 
  it was actually proven that the hartz-iv reforms did not do that much . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/german-resurgence-it-wasn-t-hartz-reforms ) [ science ] ( http://www.cream-migration.org/publ_uploads/cdp_06_14.pdf )  the hartz reforms to the labour markets implemented under chancellor gerhard schr\u00f6der were not central in the process of improving the competitiveness of german industry . 
  [ ... ] further , while the focus of the reforms was on creating incentives for seeking employment , they did little to support the remarkable wage restraint witnessed since the mid 1990 's which is the key factor in explaining the gain in competitiveness . 
  sweden does not want to join because of controversy over the italian [ 1 - $ coin ] ( http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/vector-italian-money-gold-coin-one-euro-vitruvian-image-man-leonardo-da-vinci-35692063.jpg ) , which represents an oppressive male regime and no female representation . 
  fear can make wonders ... 
  thanks !, 
  i did not know they were called the five star movement . 
  if they are for ` true democracy ' , how does voting with the party line fit in there ? 
  i know that in germany , many politicians are criticized for voting * according to * the party line too often . 
  it is seen as undemocratic and bad , but a necessary evil to keep the parliament working . 
  grillo ( the clown ? ), 
  has not gotten that much attention in germany . 
  after all , for me , berlusconi was not much better than a dictator either . 
  what is the 5 star moviment ? 
  hm , i can only think of countries like portugal and netherlands that are that far in marihuana legalization . 
  gay marriage ( as in : same principle and procedures as with ` normal ' marriage ) - it is not that common in europe is it ? 
  sorry , i do n't have time to look up the details . 
  prove me wrong !, 
  some us states are for sure . 
  just look at marihuana legalization and gay marriage . 
  they are ahead of states like germany . 
  most us-states are quite progressive compared to the majority of european countries . 
  exactly . 
  the court obviously has problems going against the guys who fund it . . 
  hungarian ^ austro empire you mean ? 
  immigration = / = immigration, 
   why does europe dislike america ? 
  it does n't . 
  but . . * there is a sentiment against certain american policies : unjustified wars ( iraq ) , unjustified surveillance ( nsa ) , ... * there is a sentiment against the american right-wing : crazy tea-party right wing fundamentalist religious extremist groups really fuck up your image . 
  euros ca n't understand why people actually listen to them . 
  * there is a sentiment against american ` arrogance ' . 
  we ca n't understand how some americans do n't know things about the world and live in some kind of bubble . 
  also your ` hooray ' - patriotism feels weird to many europeans . 
  why ? 
  there are many right-wing pro-europeans . 
  it would make sense for them . 
  that is an interesting post , thank you . 
  seeing some threads and posts in the last thread , i think anything that is anti-gypsy finds a very disturbing majority in / r/europe . 
  ( this would fall into far-right policies though . . ) furthermore , with the ukraine crisis going on : many redditors demanded euroforces , european army and so on , i guess that is not an initially left-wing thing either . 
   this is obvious , but support small family farms . 
  well this is something that many people support . 
  majority thinks that huge agricultural conglomerates are evil . 
  do n't think this is conservative , it 's rather a ` hipster-ecological-sustainability ' - thing , at least here in germany . 
  still , what he/she demands will not bring any kind of understanding and therefore it is useless crap . 
  i also want to stress that ww2 was started by germany on sept 1 , 1939 . 
   and during german occupation my russian grandmother was sent to work camp in poland . 
  she was sent there in normal humane conditions and she has no horror stories from the camp . 
   german soldiers were very polite and civil ----------------------------------------------------- you know you 're german when you automatically think sentences like this must be some kind of wrong pro-hitler propaganda  ( by the way , my grandfather , who was a german soldier actually met my ( french ) grandmother during the occupation of france , so i guess he was n't that bad . 
  if there were no ethnic minorities and `` subhumans '' to kill - why would the germans be evil towards the occupied ? 
  it would only undermine their efforts for safe ` hinterland ' ) . 
  what you demand is not better than the treaty of versailles dude . . 
  yeah sure . 
  i was thinking about euparl candidates for example . . 
  i 'd be interested in an / r/europe ama . . 
  ties = / = influence, 
  only harsh , innovative and controversial ads get into the minds of the young voters . 
  if your life is full of justin bieber and beer , you need a drastic wake-up call that is worth sharing on facebook and twitter . 
  german ad ( unofficial ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpyg4u18ixk - same prinicple . 
  this is not entirely true . 
  the `` sicherheitsdienst of the ss '' ( sicherheitsdienst des reichsf\u00fchrers-ss ) had some latvian firing squads embedded in the `` latvian legion '' . 
  they participated in mass executions and guarding of concentration camp salaspils . 
  latvian ss burned 32 polish soldiers that were cuffed with barbed wire in 1945 . 
  [ de ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/15._waffen-grenadier-division_der_ss_%28lettische_nr._1%29 ) ------------------------------------------------------------- but i agree with your simple point :  we havent moved on because you havent - i ca n't imagine how germany would be seen if we had developed similarly . 
  of course , germany had tons of outside pressure and therefore worked up it 's past quite well ( as compared to other axis nations . . ) . 
  so the receipt for russia would be : officially apologize and acknowledge maltreatment of foreign and own people on foreign and own territory . 
  ----------------------------------------------------------- thank you op for starting a very interesting discussion . 
  i can now see why some russians do n't understand it according to your 4 points . 
  lol , those elephants on a tree or elephants in a freezer jokes are actually quite popular in germany , 
  ha , this is brilliant . 
  `` no hipsters were harmed in the making of this film '', 
  usually / r/europe is not too bad when it comes to that , but here it is . 
  i agree and it is sad you get downvoted just because your opinion is different . 
  downvote the people who do obvious propaganda and do n't contribute to the discussion , but do n't downvote just because you disagree . 
  ` we ' wanted to invade the uk . 
  so you could say we wanted to annihilate the uk just like germany `` annihilated '' france , poland , greece , denmark , ... [ operation seel\u00f6we ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_sea_lion ) . 
  do you honestly think hitler wanted peace if the uk had not been such a pain in the ass for the germans ? 
  [ lol ] ( http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8m3ktvrpz1rdcn2mo1_500.gif ),
