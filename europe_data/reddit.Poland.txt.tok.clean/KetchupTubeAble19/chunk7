  armenia can not into happiness . 
  edit : ok what just happened . . 
  well yeah , but that is the one thing you have at home as well . 
  we might do some kind of drinking game ( it 's somewhere in this thread ) . 
  big screen , proper sound system , people . 
  \u00d8l \u00d8l \u00d8l, 
  low . 
  i have lots of contacts with italians at the moment , and i struggle heavily since they always weigh my words , instead of taking them with a pinch of salt - i feel like i create unnecessary drama on a regular basis :d, 
  gon na watch it in public viewing for the first time . 
  i hope it wo n't be too boring . . 
  the poster is obviously a mockery on american patriotism . 
  that is beautiful . 
  as i said - more or less . 
  i think minority rights , religious freedom and other things directly affecting minorities should be avoided in that . 
  same goes for basic constitutional rights etc. 
  the link ? 
  ye , i was just ironically answering to the comment made above . 
  it was kind of suggesting that people would purposely be anti-uk . 
  my guess is that 90 % of the readers did not even realize that the article was old . 
  sorry , did not mean to troll . 
  it works in switzerland - more or less . 
  appeasement did not work last time :p launch pre-emptive counter-blitzkrieg against london and paris to liberate the people from nationalist ukip and fn regime !, 
  there is a german `` fact-finding '' article on the wrong shit that ukip tells the people . 
  i might find the time to translate it later . 
  it 's quite a good read . 
  yes , this is one of the reasons people think that he engaged in ukraine in the first place . 
  crippling economy , shitty civil rights , popular unrest . 
  there is a concept in political science , called [ `` rally ` round the flag - effect '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rally_%27round_the_flag_effect ) :  increased short-run popular support of the president during periods of international crisis or war . 
  because rally ` round the flag syndrome reduces criticism of governmental policies , it is seen as a factor of [ diversionary foreign policy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diversionary_foreign_policy ), 
  my point was the following : if 8/10 russians support putins policies , that does not mean 8/10 russians are evil imperialists . 
  if all you read in your media is how evil the west is and how righteous the russians in ukraine struggle against `` evil nazis of eu and kiev '' - of course you would support it . 
  i am from germany : the most radical nazis were the young kids and teens who had * never in their lifes * learned anything else than what the national socialist propaganda told them . 
  it is very hard to break out of such a vicious circle . 
  ( of course , russia is different , but still . ), 
  tak !, 
  okay , so `` a38-koldsk\u00e5l '' is like that normal buttermilk-thing with some yoghurt-type addition ? 
  * germany * * the swedes conquered the whole country in the 30-year-war . 
  * the food in the southern part of germany is good . 
  the one in the north is not . 
  * swabian and saxon are the most-hated accents * most germans actually like poland . 
  * germans are only on time if they have to prove it to foreigners * `` sorry '' is used more often than `` entschuldigung '' * we secretly like it when foreigners make nazi jokes . 
  * berlin is ugly . 
  bonn is ugly . 
  stuttgart is ugly . 
  * north rhine westphalia is more fucked and degenerated than eastern germany . 
  how can you not support his politics if you do n't know any better ? 
  this is the true danger of propaganda . 
  oh god yes koldsk\u00e5l !, 
  had it last week for the first time . 
  best food/drink ever :d but can you tell me what `` a38 '' is ? 
  this . 
  i think op is wrong , berlin is seen as the capital . 
  haha , we really need more people translating stuff in this conflict  by the way : [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1bta-px8ty ) < - this is another video of the same demonstration . 
  it is the annual may 1st left-wing demonstration circlejerk and in no way affiliated to any major pro-russia meeting :d the russian version is just a plain fake . 
  yeah he is controversial . 
  he was part of the command that kidnapped hanns-martin schleyer . 
  he accused two other raf of killing schleyer . 
  ex-raf members say he has a ` tactical ' view on the truth , trying desperately to whitewash his reputation . 
  * germany * `` abgang '' - by peter j\u00fcrgen boock , former raf terrorist writes a fictional book on his experiences while being a terrorist . 
  quite well written and very thrilling . 
  gives you great insight on the hearts and minds of the time where germany was struck by national terrorism groups . 
  and then , well . 
  brecht , grass , heine and all the others . . 
  i have not seen this in any news in germany . 
  there are also germans supporting it . 
  plenty of them . 
  you know tripleg 's comment was true , no need to downvote . 
  not gon na happen . 
   `` please do not x-post us to any subs , especially meta or default subreddits , and do not mention / r / polandball in comment threads . '', 
  polandball sidebar . 
  * colonize, 
  that was a very entertaining news summary  hope you will do it for next week aswell, 
  i have to disagree here . 
  it is not ` putin using snowden ' here . 
  the revelations were huge , regardless of snowden getting shelter in russia . 
  that is the very reason why a majority wants to grant snwoden asylum in germany and not in authoritarian russia . 
  and german-russian relationship has never been worse in the past years . 
  germany is certainly not being pushed ` towards russia ' . 
  we live in europe , we should not owe allegiance to either of the two sides ( anymore ) . 
  and then again : things are n't black and white , as always . 
  there are too many things happening , so you ca n't really break it down to a us vs. russia thing . 
  well yeah , it was quite the scandal in the german public view . 
  gernot erler said it was up to schr\u00f6der , who he celebrates his birthday with . 
  many other commentators said he is a shitty ex-chancellor for not giving a fuck on german affairs . 
  given the fact he still has a bundestag office and other bonuses makes him ` sort of ' a representative still . 
  even more so for mi\u00dffelder .
