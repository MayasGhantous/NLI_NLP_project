  * but * with the u.s. spying affair and the government not allowing snowden to testify in germany , the public opinion still has quite a rage on the us - causing the right wing , populists and many other people go alongside with putin against the ` evil imperialist ' americans . 
  well they just fucked up the way to point towards their gathering  you had to turn right and then go straight for 600 metres to find the event venue . 
  it would n't be funny if i had put ` attention satire ' tags in front :d, 
  dude , flair up and bring proper news . 
  ** germany ** * foreign affairs * * the german military observers captured in ukraine have been freed . 
  prominent cdu ( governing party ) politicians criticize their role in ukraine . 
  ( `` why does a german officer hug his hostage-taker '' ? ) . 
  meanwhile , defmin von der leyen would send them in again . 
  schr\u00f6der and putin have been close friends for a long time . 
  * the speaker for foreign affairs of the cdu , phillip mi\u00dffelder , was also seen on the birthday party - he did not consult his ( political ) party or the government beforehand and is now claiming that he wanted to talk to the russians in this informal environment . 
  many want to see him gone now . 
  [ spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/missfelder-cdu-rechtfertigt-teilnahme-an-schroeder-putin-party-a-967167.html ) * meanwhile , merkel is visiting the u.s. - of course , nsa scandal only plays a minor role . 
  further talks on ukraine and free trade agreement . 
  * internal affairs * * government is facing criticism because it blocks the parliamentary inquiry commission of the german bundestag to question snowden . 
  [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/01/germany-edward-snowden-nsa-inquiry ) . 
  most germans are in favor of such a hearing . 
  * asylum seekers from balkan states face rapid deportation . 
  - the government declared several balkan states ( bosnia , macedonia , serbia ) to be `` safe '' . 
  critique comes from german ngos , the un and other organizations . 
  roma still face major discrimination in those countries . 
  * secretary of justice , maas , wants to increase the relevance of hate and racism in court trials . 
  * low unemployment , full social insurances , tax revenues as high as ever - and yet the government decides to give out presents to the voters instead of tackling important reforms !, 
  * german public tv downplays eu presidential debate [ euractiv ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/german-public-tv-downplays-eu-presidential-debate-301861 ) - sign the petition here : [change.org ] ( https://www.change.org/de/petitionen/ard-zdf-zeigt-das-europ%c3%a4ische-tvduell-zur-prime-time-und-nicht-im-sparten-tv ) * trivia * * the most successful german house model looks like this : [ `` flair113 '' ] ( http://www.hausausstellung.de/uploads/tx_tchouses/f113.2.jpg ) * 2 german brothers try to cross the border between afghanistan and pakistan and are confused for both terrorists and foreign spies . 
  ( `` here is ` the left ' - now right '' ) * the chairman of the german asssociation of criminal investigation detectives on twitter : `` that 's why we need data preservation - because of brain amputees like you '' . 
  after facing criticism , he replies : `` something is obviously wrong with you - i guess you are smaller than 1,70 m and have a small penis = you have issues '' [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/bdk_buvo/status/459336934322888704 ) [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/bdk_buvo/status/452472499809550336 ) * german magazine : `` angela merkel visiting us to apologize for nsa affair - important step to rebuild the destroyed trust of the americans in the blind trust of the europeans '' [ postillon ] ( http://www.der-postillon.com/2014/05/merkel-reist-in-usa-um-sich-bei-obama.html ), 
  haha , last year i commented on the greek song on youtube , which i quite liked . 
  it was something like ` much better than stupid german song . 
  regards from germany ' and i got incredible amount of upvotes from the greeks ;d i wo n't do it for this song though . 
  it kinda sucks . . 
  i am living with 2 albanian roomates for 3 months now . 
  my view on the balkan countries and especially albania has changed incredibly . 
  i never had better roommates . 
  i am not going to lsiten to any of the songs until the contest . 
  experience showed me , that out of 37 songs , at least 36 are shit . 
  oh yeah , i learned about him just some weeks ago - he 's brilliant in the uk . 
  meh , not very smart . 
  cheers !, 
  it 's spring here . 
  outside my window , there were 4-5 birds nests . 
  then there were many cute little birds . 
  two days later , all , except for one nest , had been plundered by cats . 
  cats kill [ 1.4 - 3.7 billion birds ] ( http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n1/full/ncomms2380.html ) every year . 
  and uk . 
  gchq . 
  i am german and i laughed . 
  also , german article lately : merkel travelling to u.s. to apologize for nsa affair : important step to rebuild the lost trust of the americans in the blind trust of the europeans . 
  it is not safe to say , if obama will accept the apology . 
  but after reading the draft of merkel 's speech on her computer on tuesday , he seemed quite touched , according to insiders . 
  well according to europeans , european ` leakers ' ( are there any ? 
  - assange ? ), 
  should not be prosecuted and therefore not have the need to seek shelter in the us . 
  but go ahead , i 'd love to see some leaking in the eu . 
  it is not seen as a threat , but as an important contribution to democracy . 
  and if anyone , the germans drunkenly march through paris with tanks :d, 
  can anyone translate what they are singing/saying ? 
  oh right , sorry i understood it differently on the first read . 
  i guess it is no significant news then . 
  everyone knows the german-government is too afraid to do anything . 
  [ english source ] ( http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/05/01/1296181/-uncle-sam-s-legal-opinion-makes-auntie-angela-real-happy ), 
  i was in both the uk and the us and i was really surprised by the similarities . 
  the suburban living seemed to be similar . 
  the lack of cycling-lanes even more . 
  i think you should elaborate on the term ` co creation ' , what it specifically means . 
  i also think you should put your questions into a survey so people can answer even more anonymously . 
  did you post this in / r/samplesize ? 
  well i 'd say 99 % of the muslims do n't live with the feeling in their minds that they have to conquer and rule the world one day . 
  most of them are like the average christian . 
  more or less religious , but not living to ` biblical standards ' . 
  oh really , do they ? 
  actually , i was quite shocked when i learned that danish isps have to save anything you do in the internet for at least a year ( ? ) . 
  studies show that it 's useless . 
  y u no change it , helle ? 
  yep , not black at all  just dreadlocks . 
  but maybe that is the same as ` black ' for bavarian police , 
  ye , sorry for the confusion :d but if i got my butt checked on a regular basis because of my holy hair , i 'd propably remove it no matter what . . 
  his dreadlocks seemed to be reason enough . 
  but then again , it 's bavaria , what do you expect :d, 
  i am sorry . 
  i was referring to his hair and translated the term wrong . 
  he has dreadlocks . 
  ( in germany , you say `` rastalocken '' ), 
  i know . 
  switzerland is also not part of the eu . 
  i was merely commenting on the possibilities the eu has . 
  i do n't know how a transition can look like , but leaving all the treaties will create problems in the uk , no matter what . 
  of course the uk might be willing to pay the price in order to avoid further problems . 
  friend of mine with rastas got checked in munich quite often . 
  they checked his asshole for drugs multiple times . 
  now he was pissed that they always picked him because of his hair and cut it . 
  yep . 
  just look at the insta-suspension of the erasmus programme when switzerland tightened their immigration laws . 
  europe can slap the uk around how it wants ( a part of me wants it to be slapped really hard ) , but i think eu wo n't completely go down on the uk and try and have it as a strong economic partner after all . 
  try / r/ukpolitics , plenty of ukip support there . 
  that is , because nato is not democratic , as opposed to the european parliament . 
  heck , it is even more democratic than westminster when it comes to representation . 
  better work on that than blocking an actually democratic institution . 
  eu parliament needs to be strengthened . 
  undemocratic eu institutions need to be weakened . 
  maybe ask mods from every eu-subreddit to promote something ? 
  they are rushing through ~ ~ belgium ~ ~ germany !,
