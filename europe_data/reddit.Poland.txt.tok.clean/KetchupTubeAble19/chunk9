  i agree . 
  but i also think that if nato and russia had worked on a combined anti-missile dome , that would have reduced tensions alot . 
  i despise putin . 
  i blame him for the increasing tensions - damn , the olympics were pretty nice , it was great to see russians and everyone else having good fun . 
  the german media is really anti-russia and anti-putin . 
  however , many germans are feeling quite ambivalent about it . 
  i and many others think that the talk of `` war '' is just heating things up much more . 
  german media made big titles on `` war in europe ? '', 
  and that felt like putting log in the fire for many germans . 
  [ reference image ] ( https://magazin.spiegel.de/epubdelivery/image/title/sp/2014/18/300 ) i perfectly understand the sentiments that are there in the baltics and poland - i was really impressed by poland and even baltic foreign policy in the cause of events . 
  your countries are much more stable than ukraine and putin ca n't pull the same stuff there . 
  and if he does , the whole continent will stand by your side , 
  brillant . 
  yep . 
  & no familiar ties to poland . 
  [ hidden treasures of europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_jrjpl9irq ), 
  show this to nigel farage . 
  very good video , extremely well-made , 
  i hope you were not being serious . 
  germanys view of polish people has never been higher . 
  it is one of the strongest economic partners . 
  the majority of germans thinks really well of them . 
  thank you berlin and turkey . 
  here 's the / r/europe debate discussion thread : [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/247ir6/postec_president_debate_discussion/ ), 
  but you can get plenty of other fruit being shipped in from all over the world . 
  i even saw apples from new zealand in german supermarkets . 
  fucking ridiculous . 
  hm - baden w\u00fcrttemberg as well here , but did not get it yet . 
  but those were just from a contest of design students right ? 
  someone posted them on reddit some time ago . 
  yes , i agree , 
  brilliant as always . 
  for the elections , they also demand * 17 % quota of lazy people in leading positions * a wall around switzerland * wildlife protection for green party * fracking of two former ( fat ) environmental ministers * and much more [ website ] ( http://www.die-partei.de/ ), 
  well it was professionally translated in 13 european languages . 
  i think in the next debate , everyone can speak in their own language iirc . 
  this will make the debate more calm and less confusing i recon , since you always have to wait for translation . 
  haha !, 
   might aswell move to romania then . 
  find a job as professional internet user and enjoy life . 
  that is , of course , if the fellow romanians are welcoming towards people that come from less developed parts of europe and seek a better fortune . 
  man , you guys make western europe feel like a third world country . 
  we really have to catch up on that . 
  i 'd gladly trade some useless roads for proper internet everywhere . 
  yep . 
  they want to build it around germany :p, 
  german here . 
  i like war jokes . 
  it 's like talking to your siblings on how you used to fight each other over stupid things . 
  oh - there was a huge debate in germany last week on the general state of our infrastructure . 
  we lack billions of euros to maintain it . 
  if we keep going like this and just build new stuff instead of taking care of the old things , we will have a massive problem quite soon . 
  there are huge problems already on streets , rails and waterways . 
  here 's an [ article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/diw-weak-infrastructure-investment-threatens-german-future-a-907885.html ), 
  i posted this already , but here we go again : ** after the debate ** * it was nice that all candidates spoke freely and that the questions posed seemed to be not known to them beforehand . 
  * ** conversation ** : moderators made follow-up questions , not asking everyone the same thing . 
  the candidates could argue with each other * ** atmosphere ** : very relaxed and laid back . 
  it was even funny some times . 
  much better than the debates i am used from germany . 
  but very hectic at times due to time pressure . 
  * ** time ** : as usual , the biggest issue . 
  many interesting points , but huge lack of time . 
  no possibility to get into detail . 
  but then again , if you want plenty of people to watch , it ca n't go any deeper than this . 
  * ** moderators ** : very rusty start , but they did quite well imho . 
  fun game with the seconds . 
  good thing they did not rely on the time machines , cutting people off mid-sentence . 
  * ** impact ** : since nobody watched it - it wont have a great impact . 
  max . 
  400 viewers on youtube . 
  but 10.000 tweets/minute . 
  it was promoted by all major european institution beforehand , but it was not promoted by most national media , pretty sad . 
  * ** candidates ** : all of them were allright . 
  keller was a bit over-enthusiastic . 
  schultz was a bit annoying at times with talking when he was told to stop . 
  juncker was too quiet . 
  looking forward to debate # 2 . 
  what letter ?
