  instead of going the police in country they were allegedly attacked they decided to go back home and go to media .

  for illegal border crossing the best you could expect should be prison , deportation or if you withstand - way more drastic solutions . 
  if they do not have respect for such fundamental law , do n't expect they will respect you . 
  if you want assylum just apply for it .

   in 2012 , russia chose kaliningrad as the second region ( after moscow ) to deploy the s-400 ( sam ) missile system . 
   at the beginning of 2010 the number of ground forces in the kaliningrad special district was 10,500 ground troops ( excluding the 1,100 in the marine corps ) , divided into one motorized infantry brigade , one mechanized infantry regiment , one missile brigade with 12-18 defense systems otr-21 tochka , one artillery brigade , one helicopter regiment , one defense team . 
  in the army of the kaliningrad special district at the beginning of 2010 there were 811 tanks , 1,239 armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers of various types , 345 artillery and rocket systems . 
  however , by 2012 , the size of the marine brigade in the kaliningrad region is projected to increase to four thousand troops . 
   according to 2014 data the region holds 225,000 military personnel , the number that seems to have increased last two years . 
  kaliningrad is both advantage and danger for russian military and political interests in the baltic region and a challenge for nato to counter the possible treats coming from russian military stationed there . 
  you should ask ukraine i guess .
