  most authoritative regimes hold elections that does n't mean they 're democratic . 
  however , there is a longer culture of elections as opposed to referendums in most western countries . 
  mostly true , but even with the longer culture of elections , they are still far from perfect . 
  if these are strong enough arguments to state referendums are less democratic , then the same goes for elections . 
  you can use the exact same valid arguments against them - they can be dangerous if done wrong , they are steered/manipulated by the elites , people often vote emotionally without understanding all the long term consequences , etc. 
  if one is less democratic , the other one also is ( it having a longer culture doesnt change anything ) . 
   as i understand it , the article implies liberal democracies maybe it does , i dont want to argue semantics , especially since it doesnt really impact my argument . 
   imagine a situation where a people voted that people of different races did not have civil rights . 
  would that be democratic ? 
  based on what you 've been saying i 'm assuming you 'd say yes , but i think we 'll disagree on that . 
  : / in the most basic sense of the word democracy - yes . 
  is that a good thing - of course not . 
  my point is that referendums arent unique in the fact that they can threaten democratic values , electing the wrong people into government can just as easily do that . 
  if this is a good enough argument to say referendums are less democratic , then its just as good to say democratic elections are less democratic . 
  imho the direct connection of referendums as direct democracy trumps the potential in-direct threat of democratic values , so they are more democratic not less . 
  they are excluded in the sense that , instead of the few elites making the decision , the many can make a decision in a referendum ( even if they are partially guided by the elites ) . 
  thats still more democratic , not less . 
  in one the elites have direct power , in the other have indirect power . 
  doesnt really matter the exact type of democracy ( i dont even think the article mentions any specific type of democracy , just in a general sense ) . 
  liberal democracy or any other type , the key word is democracy . 
  voting maybe `` only '' one of the parameters but its the main one - democracy = rule of the people , how else can people rule if not by voting . 
  also , many of the articles points of `` referendums being dangerous '' can be said about regular elections , would you go that step further in saying elections are less democratic ? 
  i dont think so . 
  whats the alternative , letting the `` elites '' that cause the ill-defined opinions , decide by themselves ? 
  for me thats a stretch . 
  if that was there main point , it should have been the focus . 
  instead they just showed its potential dangers and a couple extreme examples . 
  i think they would also need more proof that a tool of direct democracy is `` less democratic '' . 
  for example they mention a couple times that politicians just use it as a political play . 
  but what is the alternative , just let the political `` elites '' do what they want , how is that more democratic . 
  fair enough , but as i pointed out the whole article is about them being potentially dangerous , nothing really about them being less democratic . 
  the title of this article doesnt match its content . 
  the whole article is about how referendums can be dangerous and why politicians can use them , it barely mentions them not being democratic . 
  for example in the first couple paragraphs we have this :  `` they demonstrated why many political scientists consider ** referendums messy and dangerous ** . '', 
   `` when asked ** whether referendums were a good idea ** , michael marsh , a political scientist at trinity college dublin , said , `` the simple answer is almost never . '' '' nothing about if they are democratic , only if they are dangerous . 
  the only real mention about them being democratic or not is here :  `` though such votes are portrayed as popular governance in its purest form , ** studies have found that they often subvert democracy rather than serve it ** . 
  they tend to be volatile , turning not just on the merits of the decision but also on unrelated political swings or even , as may have happened in colombia , on the weather . '', 
  no information about these studies and the next sentence mentions how they are dangerous . 
  again - not really being about `` undemocratic '' . 
  ill just add some parts from your source that you just skipped over . 
  `` half of poles oppose the right to abortion , ** but only one in seven ( 14 % ) supports the complete ban of all abortions ** , while more than one-third ( 36 % ) believe there should be exceptions . 
  ** at the same time , almost half ( 45 % ) think that abortion should be permitted ** . '', 
  the wiki may be a bit unclear so lets look directly at the source - cbos poll : http://www.cbos.pl/pl/publikacje/news/2016/13/newsletter.php abortion should be legal in case of : * mothers life is in danger : yes - 80 % , no - 11 % * mothers health is in danger : yes - 71 % , no - 18 % * rape/incest : yes - 73 % , no - 16 % and so on . 
  how do you figure the vast majority want an abortion ban ? 
   the vast majority of people in poland want this law to pass and abortion to become illegal . 
  bullshit , source required . 
  for now , but if as i suspect , the abortion compromise wont be changed , no one will remember about this next elections , if someone brings it up , pis will have that answer i gave before . 
  im not assuming ceta would be as interesting as abortion ban , of course not , but thats kind of the point . 
  use a smokescreen thats emotional , interesting and divides people , to make sure people dont know about important things . 
  im not saying abortion laws arent important , just that nothing will change with this , the ban wont be voted in . 
  people wont care as much , but they definitely will know more about it and they would criticise the government for introducing it . 
  now , not many people really know anything about ttip and ceta . 
   this is a good theory but it also did n't give them much , to the contrary , it actually mobilised a part of electorate that was pretty passive till now . 
  true , but that doesnt really matter now . 
  if this never gets passed . 
  the opposition wont really be able to use this as ammo before the next elections . 
  pis will be able to easily defend this by saying - `` this was a civic project and we honoured all those collected signatures by `` working '' on it , instead of dismissing a civic project right away like po did . 
  we value our citizens , bla bla bla ... ''  and with ceta , they 're facing opposition by ziobro , of all people ( and it 's an opposition that i support , even though i hate the guy ) . 
  the problem is that barely anyone is talking about ceta now and its possible that ceta will start to function at the beginning of 2017 . 
  not much time left for any sort of discussions . 
   i say damage control because i do n't think that they thought the outcry would be as big as it is . 
  maybe , but the louder and more radical the protests get , the easier it is for the government to back away from it . 
  thank you !, 
  its a standard political play . 
  it started to get loud about the nepotism in pis and the ceta discussion in parliament was coming up . 
  `` suddenly '' the topic of abortion comes up , even though the civic project was prepared months ago . 
  dislike kaczynski and pis all you want ( im not a fan myself ) , but dont let that blind you into thinking they dont know what they are doing . 
  the complete ban of abortion would be political suicide . 
  i dont think its damage control , i think all of this was on purpose . 
  all of this seems to be a red herring . 
  the required amount of signatures for this civic project were collected a while back , the topic of abortion `` suddenly '' popped up now , when it started to get loud about nepotism in pis and when ceta was supposed to be discussed in the parliament ( this was postponed ) . 
  sadly this tactic is used way too often in our politics . 
  imo it has no chance , the protests may help , but i dont think it ever was planned to be passed . 
  for 2 reasons : it would be political suicide and it seems to be a distraction topic ( very often used in polish politics ) . 
  this whole situation looks like a red herring . 
  the topic of abortion just so happened to pop up when it was getting louder and louder about the governments nepotism and when ceta was supposed to be discussed in the parliament , not a couple months back when this abortion ban ( civic project ) collected the required amount of signatures . 
  the current abortion compromise isnt perfect , but its generally accepted and radically changing this wont end well . 
  they wood like that . 
  not at all , its a loud/controversial topic so its very possible that it is only a `` temat zastepczy '' as you said . 
  that tactic is quite popular in polish politics . 
  im surprised/impressed you knew the polish term . 
  part of the government may vote for it , but i do not believe it would be the majority . 
  i didnt say anything against that . 
  just they shouldnt lie about it , because if/when the lie comes out , that can make it look more anti-pis ( like many things in poland ) than anti-abortion ban . 
  are you even reading what i am saying ... ill try one last time , to make it clear . 
  when i said `` only time will tell '' i meant there is no pointing in continuing discussing with / u/emnel if the government will vote this in or not , he thinks they will , i think they wont , we wont change eachothers mind on this . 
  hence only time will tell which one of us was right - do they vote it in or not . 
  i think you are right or its just a nod to the church and ultra-catholic people . 
  it makes no sense at all to vote this in , it would be political suicide . 
   sorry for any mistakes in my grammar . 
  english is not my first language . 
  i love this [ this ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/a49zpxw/when-people-apologize-for-their-bad-english ), 
  you , i like you . 
  did i say they shouldnt protest ? 
  did i say only protest after ? 
  stop putting idiotic words into my mouth . 
  me saying , `` lets wait and see '' was more along the lines - only time will tell if they will pass it or not , i wont change / u/emnel mind about this and he wont change mine ( im completely against this abortion ban , but i think there is no chance in hell it will get voted in ) . 
  you just went off the deep end . 
  i didnt say any of those things . 
  protest all you want , but dont lie that this is prepared by the government .
