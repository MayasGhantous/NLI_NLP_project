  if someone broke into your house , would you run away and leave the rest of the family behind ? 
  just because % wise , theres a good chance you would be seen as a threat and attacked while others could be ignored ( children , elderly etc. 
  depending on the situation ) - they are no threat to whoever broke in ? 
  your family ** should ** be ok , right ? 
   defend your home from who ? 
  every other organised militia in the region ? 
  just one man against an army ? 
  your home as in home/country depending on the situation . 
   that makes no fucking sense . 
  it does . 
  if staying to fight is never the best option , then people or at least according to you , men should run . 
  the aggressor takes over since no one stayed to fight . 
  what is stopping them from continuing on ? 
  everyone should just keep running from them , right ? 
  to make it simpler for you , you live at `` a '' , someone invades , you run to `` b '' , they or someone else attacks `` b '' , you and everyone from `` b '' run to `` c '' and so on , until you run to `` z '' and theres no other place to run to . 
  and how are most of these people refugees ? 
  they are immigrants , big difference . 
   yes , just . 
  because what happens to men is a hell of a lot worse . 
  can you wrap your head around that ? 
  there 's a reason i worded that the way i did ; the fact that you completely failed to grasp the point and your brain went into a gynocentric apoplexy should n't surprise me . 
  no , your mistaken , i perfectly understood what you said , i just dont agree with it and your way of thinking seems ludicrous - its okay that ill run away , my mom/sister/wife / child/etc will just get raped , treated like a slave , maybe get tortured/murdered , no big deal . 
  just because % wise , im at a greater risk ? 
   if all lives are worth as much , then the men , who would have suffered the most fleeing actually gets you the best out come . 
  if that was the best outcome then all men would just keep on running until there was no other place to run , while the attacker just kept going after them . 
  you tried and failed at analysing me with your `` gynocentric apoplexy '' , now let me try . 
  you dont give a shit about the best outcome or what happens to your friends and family , you only care about yourself . 
   under no circumstances is `` staying to fight '' the optimal outcome , i wont even bother commenting on this , if you think staying to defend ones home is never the best solution . 
  my point was a bit different . 
  that information was added to make the reader sympathise with the migrants , but it really doesnt add anything on this topic . 
  it wasnt hungarys fault that the kid drowned , if anyone is to blame , its the mother . 
  its just bbc being bias . 
   they wo n't ** just ** get put in a burka , ** raped and sometimes killed ** . 
  well that sounds like a breeze , why was i so worried then . 
  are you kidding me ?!, 
   so women that run are abandoning their fathers , brothers and husbands . 
  no , the difference is generally speaking that women/children/elderly arent able to fight/defend themselves . 
  this was more true in the past , but still is true now . 
  so in the first situation the group of people who are able to fight - fought and the other group unable to fight - fled . 
  in this situation we have the opposite , the group that is able to fight - run , while the rest that are unable to do so - stay in danger . 
  i know im speaking generally here with `` able to fight/defend themselves '' but we are talking about a trend , not each specific case ( which would be impossible to do ) . 
  ... and other irrelevant information like :  `` last week a 10-year-old afghan boy drowned while trying to wash in a pond nearby . 
  his mother walks aimlessly through the camp with her other children , too sad to speak to anyone . '', 
   so were the aforementioned women fleeing while men fought in your example . 
  or do familial ties in your universe only go on way ? 
  how can you compare that ? 
  in one case the women/children/elderly fled to safe places and the men stayed to fight/defend their home . 
  in this case , the men are fleeing to safe places while the rest stay where it is dangerous . 
  you really dont see the difference ? 
   what do you mean by `` families '' here , wives and children ? 
  i thought they were supposed to be unmarried young men ; was n't that the narrative ? 
  how do you know they are unmarried ? 
  i havent seen anything confirming that . 
  they are relatively young but not that young that they cant have wives/children . 
  but even if they dont , what about mothers , sisters , grandparents etc. 
   have you considered the fact that young men might actually be the most at risk population in a country at war ? 
  would n't you prioritise your family members most likely to get drawn into conflict and killed and facilitate their escape ? 
  definitely not in this way - me and my brother run while the rest of the family ( less likely to `` get drawn into conflict '' ) stay ? 
  that would be abandoning them . 
  because they are abandoning their families . 
  i think you totally missed his point . 
  normally young men fight in wars while their families ( children , wife , sisters etc ) flee . 
  in this case it seems to be the other way around . 
  most of the people fleeing to europe are young men . 
  i did not expect a eu politician to come out and say it that direct . 
  i guess they will never stop surprising me . 
  taking into account everything you have said so far ( first post that you admitted went too far , unnecessary need to combine po and n to prove trend when i just stated pis won in all demographics and so on ) i suspect a different intent , but since i cant prove intent , ill leave it at that . 
  why the sarcasm ? 
  is there or isnt there a stereotype like this for pis voters ? 
  we both know there is . 
  if that wasnt your intent , then what was ? 
  because showing a trend ( less educated pis won by more , more educated pis won by less ) you could have done that without connecting po and n , yet you still did . 
   i obviously did n't mean to suggest that pis somehow lost the elections or that the opposition `` should '' have won , and to be honest i am surprised to see people reacting as if i did . 
  i guess this is how the political polarization of our times looks like . 
  i never said that was your point and a quick glance at the rest of the comments doesnt show anyone else doing this . 
  i see it as , you connecting those 2 was more to disprove that pis won in all demographics . 
  the only reason i see to do this is to try continue the stereotype that only uneducated ( read : stupid ) from small villages vote for pis , which again is not true . 
   i was trying to say that the people who are most likely to get angered by the tribunal crisis are also the group which pis can more or less afford to ignore . 
  i think thats closer to the truth , because a large part of the protesters are core electorate of other opposition parties . 
   their split provided a nice bonus for pis as far as the parliament representation goes . 
  not really , there split was needed . 
  po was the `` old government '' which people were sick of , while n tried their hardest to pretend to be new and not connected to old politics . 
  if n grouped up with po during the elections , they would have lost their credibility right away . 
   but that 's irrelevant for the demographics discussion . 
  so you agree it was pointless to sum up their results . 
   come on , i 've never said those things . 
  maybe not those words exactly but you are trying to push the stereotype that well educated people from cities dont vote much for pis , which is just not true ( more true in 2005 ) . 
  are these not your words ? 
   there are a lot of people who care , but they tend to be ** educated , relatively affluent members of the middle class , especially from big cities ** - in other words , ** a demographics which has never liked the current government anyway ** and why are you adding po and n together ? 
  thats just a cheap trick trying to morph the results . 
  the fact is pis won in all those groups . 
  its true that the higher the education the differences are smaller , but still people with highest education voted more for pis than any other party . 
  im not saying they wouldnt , but imo in these regards : kissing up to usa , spying ( legally though ) the previous governents are ahead for now . 
  curious about what human rights your referring to . 
  well , the truth is , it was the previous governments that allowed cia blacksites in poland , iirc kwasniewski admitted to that , in the last couple years of the previous government there were record high amounts of wire-tapping/checking billings . 
  but lets give time for pis to catch up . 
  stop with the `` only poor uneducated people voted for pis '' . 
  in the last election they won in almost all , if not all the different demographics . 
  it didnt matter age , city/village etc. 
  im not a pis voter and never will be , but im sick of hearing this .
