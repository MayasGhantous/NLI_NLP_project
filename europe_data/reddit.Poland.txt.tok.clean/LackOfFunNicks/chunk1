first of all i want to mention that i am against this type of threads as they cause only waves of hatred and massive shitshorms . 
  secondly , poland is not an eastern european country , but i understand that in this question you put poland in that group . 
  so be it . 
  and if i have to answer that question , i would say that i do n't like their ignorance of the communism and more precisely their ignorance of the role of soviets in wwii . 
  nine times out of ten when someone on r/europe uses the term `` liberation of eastern europe '' that someone is a guy with french flag . 
  it 's not offensive . 
  eastern europe is great . 
  complicated and rich history , delicious cuisine and very nice people . 
  it 's just untrue to say that poland belongs to eastern europe . 
  black bread from lithuania . 
  i do n't even know name of my neighbour . 
   3 ) family businesses should be preferred and prioritized over multinational corporations . 
  i think that it is ** in theory ** official policy of most european countries . 
  ok , now i 'm a little bit worried ... 
  history is just history . 
  some things which happened in the past . 
  war in ukraine is real and it 's happening right now . 
   russia was the 3rd largest eu trade partner before the sanctions . 
  france , denmark , spain , italy , ** poland ** and other countries were hit by the sanctions on a noticeable level , because their home produce such as apples , poultry , diary products do n't have a market to export to . 
  and yet poland strongly support sanctions . 
  barefoot all year round . 
  if it makes you feel any better , they are not much friendly to poles either . 
  georgians if we consider georgia european country . 
  it 's not offensive here . 
  i do n't have locks in bedroom doors . 
  barefoot - always . 
  i agree with you , but seeing your flair i must use [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2rtafbqepg ) . 
  ca n't argue with that . 
  i must disagree about belarus . 
  it 's way better place than transnistria . 
  hmm ... odd but interesting . 
  thanks for explaining that to me . 
  ok , fair enough . 
  so how would americans called person who do n't have polish ancestry and citizenship but was brought up in polish culture and consider himself polish ? 
  but ethnicity is not determined by genetics , but by  common ancestral , language , social , cultural or national experiences that 's why i can say that [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killion_munyama ) is ethnic polish because , despite not having any polish ancestry , he belongs to polish culture , he started thinking like one of us , etc. 
   you ca n't just become an ethnic german , you 're either born like that or you are n't . 
  of course you can , just like you can become an ethnic polish . 
  do you live in a tram ? 
  or do you live in a barn ? 
   i 've a culture too . 
  the way i cook , the way i think , my cultural references , my accent , are rather typical of a french person . 
  exactly . 
   but this is a memetic thing , not a genetic thing . 
  ethnicity is not about genetic , it is about  common ancestral , language , social , cultural or national experiences while nationality , at least in english , means only legal relationship between a person and a state . 
   we are a patchwork that have been stirred ... and that was before the 19th century , were lots of things have uniformed around the country , while we had some influx from the neighbours . 
  like every nation . 
  so , tell me , if french is only nationality then if you would renounced your citizenship would that mean that you are no longer french ? 
   an ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestral , language , social , cultural or national experiences . 
  french is both ethnicity and nationality . 
  i do n't think in foreign language . 
   i 'm a teetotaler do you mind if i ask why ? 
  i 'm just curious . 
  does [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podkowa_le%c5%9bna ) count ? 
  proud part of plc. 
  they are quite popular in poland . 
  yes , they were very popular when i was kid and i think they still are . 
   i like the national park system , with the passes . 
  we have it in poland . 
  [ jan matejko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_matejko ) paintings . 
  especially [ sta\u0144czyk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sta%c5%84czyk_ ( painting ) and [ rejtan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rejtan_ ( painting ) . 
  i love poznan but if i have to choose then krakow is the winner . 
   western sahara a scottish autonomous region what ? 
  none of this cities are in eastern europe . 
  they are in central europe . 
  i think you should replace poznan with krakow and brno/olumouc with prague . 
  better universities and nicer cities . 
   try to befriend people hanging in parks i 'm sorry to tell you this but it probably wo n't work , at least not in poland . 
  people just do n't start conversations with strangers here . 
  anyway , good luck . 
  off-top : dutch seems to be very similar to english . 
  per month, 
  1 ) corruption was huge problem in poland in ' 90 , but fortunately nowadays its not big problem . 
  2 ) you are not using `` worlds '' ( 1st etc. ), 
  labels in correct way . 
  3 ) from my experience , i would say that living standards in st. petersburg and moscow are higher than in for example warsaw . 
  i do n't know if it apply to other big cities , though . 
  as for rural areas poland has definitely higher standards . 
  well it of course depends on person , but for example physical violence is extremely rare . 
  so shouting , cursing - may happend , fighting or something similar - rather not, 
  firstly , i think i need to clarify , this  2 ) complain about how government/opposition is destroing our country has been around far longer than pis or po . 
  and answering your question - discussion happens ( which involves all 3 topics mentioned by u/seamstress80 ) . 
  i disagree . 
  in poland if you want to start conversation you should : 1 ) complain how small you earn and that your boss is asshole ( if you do n't have boss you complain about taxes ) 2 ) complain about how government/opposition is destroing our country 3 ) complain about position of church ( it is too strong/weak ) then you can continue one of that topics or start the new one . 
  and could you tell me how extreme individualism look like ? 
  well , in poland we will be celebrating 100th anniversary of recovery of independence . 
  we have , but we also have president who is elected in direct elections . 
  i 'm not sure whether you are sarcastic or not . 
  i think that our president should be elected by parliament . 
  life of [ witold pilecki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witold_pilecki ) . 
  i have one , but i do n't use it often . 
  at least 8 years . 
  5 years of studying law at university + 3 years internship ( work in law firm + exams and courses ) . 
  marek edelman ( last commander of warsaw ghetto uprising ) used to say something similar - that the jewish state should have been founded in bavaria , where is , at least , nicer weather than in me . 
  it 's not the football game where i can say `` well they seems like nice guys , i will support them '' . 
  i support peace , stability and human rights . 
  and those things ca n't be achieved as long there is no political will for that . 
  right now current situation suits both sides - nationalist nutjobs from israeli government and terrorist who claim to represent palestinian nation . 
  i hope it will change . 
  i belive that both israel and palestine have right to be independent , sovereign countries . 
  1 - 6 1 is the worst = you failed ** at university ** 2 - 5 3 is passable,
