  he 's not wrong , though . 
  polacy means all male poles or all poles regardless of their sex . 
  i know that i should answer yes , but if i have to be honest then no , i 'm too lazy . 
  same here . 
   i hope it does n't take a toll on the impartiality of the narrative , though . 
  unfortunately it does . 
  i know that davies is rather popular so i risk the downvotes but he sometimes simplifies some problems and he tend to be uncritical . 
  fascist and communist . 
  for me it 's hungary . 
  initially nomads who had been attacking the lands across whole europe , from france to the bosphorus . 
  then under the rulers like louis the great or matthias corvinus hungary became one of the most important states in central and southern europe . 
  they survived the division of the country between the habsburgs and turkey . 
  interesting is the history of hungary in the 20th century , their role in the first and second world war and the 1956 uprising . 
  each , it would be great . 
  what could go wrong ? ^ / s, 
   to me our flag with coa on it feels kinda cheap and rough , like those ` disposable ' plastic flags sold on football matches . 
  i could n't agree more, 
  and brajan ( brian ) . 
  i think i 'm quite traditional . 
  i like polish food , customs , holidays etc. 
   before i had access to the internet i had no idea the world had so many idiots ** do n't believe everything you see on the internet ** - j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski, 
  i would say that it is more kids thing than just european thing . 
  i had to google what `` sovereign citizens '' are so the answer is no . 
  and rotblat , he is still a little forgotten . 
  well my country already spent more than 2 % gdp on military and i support the idea of eu army so yes . 
  poniedzia\u0142ek - day after sunday wtorek - second day of the week ( from archaic wt\u00f3ry ) \u015aroda - day in the middle of the week czwartek - fourth day of the week pi\u0105tek - fifth day of the week sobota - name comes from word `` shabbat '' niedziela - day during you do n't work as you can see we are not very creative . 
  it depends on what we should consider as `` traditional clothes '' . 
  whether it should be all old clothes or just folk costumes . 
  if the latter then no , i do n't like polish folk costumes . 
  but i really like [ sarmatian style ] ( http://bernatowicz.pl/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/stroje.jpg ) which was popular among polish nobility in xvi , xvii and to some extent in xviii century . 
  monday . 
  i see your point but `` bia\u0142as '' is clearly derogatory term while , in polish tradition , `` murzyn '' is not pejorative term . 
  i would agree with you if the cake was called for example `` czarnuch '' or `` czarnuszek '' . 
  oh come on , how `` murzynek '' can be offensive ? 
  let 's not go too far . 
  i still remember that someone wanted to remove from the school curriculum the poem `` murzynek bambo '' , because he considered it racist . 
  yes , i think generally i agree with that statement but as always the devil is in the details . 
  white-tailed eagle and stork . 
  [ ignacy daszy\u0144ski ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/ignacy_daszynski2_%28cropped%29.jpg ) was pm only for few days , but look at that moustache !, 
  i would also add kashubian to that . 
  what about krak ? 
  father of wanda , he is related to the legend of wawel 's dragon , etc. 
  atat\u00fcrk , habib bourguiba and mannerheim . 
  sovkhoz is state farm , kulak is different thing . 
  my great-grandfather and his brother were killed in auschwitz . 
  other great-grandfather was killed during wola massacre , his wife was repeatedly raped by ukrainian allies of nazis . 
  other great-granfather was tortured by soviets and his brother was killed by nkvd . 
  so yes , a lot of tragedy . 
  i 'm pretty content with what we have right now . 
  1997 - new constitution 1999 - joining nato 2004 - joining eu 2010 - smolensk disaster, 
  i have to disagee , we call elizabeth ii queen , do n't we ? 
   one of the lithuanian dukes married a polish ** queen ** effectively becoming the polish king and joining poland and lithuania into a union fun fact - jadwiga of poland , in poland known as jadwiga andegawe\u0144ska was ** king ** of poland . 
  in polish we say `` pretending to be greek '' . 
  bathroom, 
  i am totally against conscription . 
  polish ( native ) english ( fluent ) and i think that my russian is pretty decent . 
  excuse me but i have to ask - why polish ? 
  i saw it few times but i do n't think that it 's popular . 
  [ hajn\u00f3wka county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hajn%c3%b3wka_county ) . 
  most of local population belong to the orthodox church , half of the population consider themselves belarusian . 
  well it was capital for short period of time . 
  same here . 
  i 'm also from warsaw . 
  with such frequency it could only be cracow , warsaw or wroclaw and warsaw has metro so you can see more people at one moment . 
  oh , we also have egg fighting ( at least my family had it , do n't know if it is popular in rest of country ) . 
  they were good military leaders but king should be more than that . 
  both of them make some serious mistakes in domestic politics . 
  we ( poles ) and reddit like this vienna meme but one victory is not enough to be consider good ( and especially not the greatest ) leader . 
  i agree with the worst , but strongly disagree with the best . 
  only casimir iii the great !, 
  however , i can agree that every casimir was a great ruler . 
  [ stefan du\u0161an ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_du%c5%a1an ) ? 
  my favourite small town is [ zamo\u015b\u0107 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/zamosc_pierzeja_polnocna.jpg ) in poland but it is little bit bigger ( 65k ) . 
  i also like [ sanok ] ( http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/00/75/55/51_big.jpg ) in poland and [ \u010cesk\u00fd krumlov ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/krumlov20%28js%29panoramic.jpg ) in czechia . 
  they seems like better version of us . 
  so you does n't consider wallachian and moldavian hospodars as your monarchs ? 
  this thread makes me so hungry ... 
  top comment from that thread also applies to this one : dude ... 
  poland is also central europe . 
  we do n't have any separatists . 
  thanks anyway , i will keep searching . 
  speaking of which , i have a serious question . 
  do you know why all [ flags of estonian counties are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_estonian_counties ) white and green ? 
  no problem . 
   the most recent amendment passed in the 1960s it 's little awkward for me to correct you in this , but the most recent amendment ( 27th ) passed in 1992 . 
  26th amendment passed in 1971 . 
  yes . 
  we know . 
  * the accursed kings * are great . 
  i think that the best english book about poland is * `` a concise history of poland '' * by jerzy lukowski . 
  in poland it 's the same . 
  yes . 
  every ten years [ central statistical office ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_statistical_office_ ( poland ) conducts national census . 
  i do n't exactly know what you mean with `` grouping '' so i will just give you link to the latest census [ results ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_census_of_2011 ) . 
  firstly horatio is really awesome name . 
  besides that i consider him one of the greatest navy commanders in the history . 
  i do n't think that we have any equivalents . 
   first ( modern ) constitution in europe , second in history only after the us one . 
  you are not wrong , but you are also not entirely right . 
  in 1755 corsican patriot and leader pasquale paoli proclaimed corsica a sovereign nation and created the corsican constitution .
