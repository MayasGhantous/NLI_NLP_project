  that constitution was very liberal for its time , much more than american or polish . 
  if we recognise that the corsican constitution is the oldest constitution in the world ( and i see no reason why we should n't do that ) then polish is the third in the world and second in europe . 
  to have abortion women need approval from doctor , not from minister . 
  and doctors are not being changed after elections . 
  we have it . 
  it 's called knowledge about society ( it covers the basics of sociology , political science and law ) . 
  i disagree . 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  abortion is legal in poland in three cases : when the woman 's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy , when the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act , when the fetus is seriously malformed .

  [ kyrgyzstan ] ( https://motoadventuresiberia.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/sam_1392-1.jpg ) i love those hats . 
  i am neither muslim nor catholic - i consider myself an agnostic , but my family is rather catholic . 
  my family changed religion in the in the middle of nineteenth century but our roots were always important for us , we still cherish some customs like preparing the traditional tatar dishes . 
  one minor point - `` lipka tatars '' is just different name for `` lithuania tatars '' or `` polish tatars '' . 
  source - i 'm lipka tatar and also [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ), 
  well `` weso\u0142ych \u015bwi\u0105t '' literally means `` happy holidays '' , so ... 
  now we can be proud to have the biggest lemon squeezer in the whole world . 
  explanation : the photos were taken in 2013 in small town [ w\u0119gr\u00f3w ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c4%99gr%c3%b3w ) during hubertus w\u0119growski ( feast of st. huberts who is patron of hunters and horse riders ) . 
  the guy on the right on the 1 photo is current minister of environment ( back then he was just mp from this region ) . 
  a to podst\u0119pne pepiki , to zamach stanu !, 
  better late than never . 
  he knew , he is polish . 
  it 's trolling . 
  p\u00f3\u0142torak is awesome but it is rather expensive alcohol . 
   plus , slavic mythology/history is still pretty political in some countries . 
  thats interesting . 
  can you elaborate on this ? 
   in general people do n't want to be called eastern , as they hate being in one group with countries like russia/belarus ( which they consider to be backwards ) . 
  i really like eastern europe art , especially early ruthenian icons , i also love cuisine since it is so similar to ours yet still different . 
  eastern europe is not derogatory term for me . 
  i 'm just tired with that stupid cold war division . 
  i can understand it when it comes from non-europeans but not from europeans , they should know more , they should be able to make a distinction between eastern bloc and eastern europe . 
  yes but it should be marked differently then . 
  yeah i know but i ca n't get used to it . 
  and analphabet is also english word although less popular . 
  thank you , as i said i 'm computer analphabet  . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  thanks but it seems that i 'm computer analphabet - i did what you said , did n't help . 
  thanks anyway . 
  true but i think that grodzka still had a huge impact on that ( even as an object of jokes ) . 
  you know they `` play '' according the rules , they just `` changed '' the team . 
  poland is not eastern europe . 
  also like i said  as for poland - we had anna grodzka who was the third openly transgender member of a national parliament worldwide and second in europe . 
  when you see real person , not evil creature created by propaganda , you are more `` immune '' to hatred . 
  it 's easier to hate your projection . 
  there is mistake . 
  jagiellonians did n't rule mazovia at that time , it was ruled by dukes from piast dynasty which were vassals of polish king . 
  wow , thats heavy downvote . 
  i mean i thought that this sub is more liberal than avarage population . 
  estonia is still most liberal former soviet country when it comes to the lgbt rights . 
  short answer ? 
  soviet past . 
  longer ? 
  it is a combination of several reasons , including stereotypes , poverty , conservative minorities and many others . 
  source of data : [ eurobarometer report ] ( http://www.equineteurope.org/img/pdf/ebs_437_en.pdf#page=64 ) . 
  as for poland - we had [ anna grodzka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_grodzka ) who was the third openly transgender member of a national parliament worldwide and second in europe . 
  it is . 
  you are confusing western world with western europe, 
  please show me separatist movement from silesia . 
  that 's great news . 
   according to romanucci-ross , while mickiewicz called himself a `` lithuanian '' , in his time the idea of a separate `` lithuanian identity '' , apart from a `` polish '' one , did not exist . 
  just like i can tell that i 'm mazovian . 
  i think that he is talking about [ wincenty smokowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wincenty_smokowski ) . 
  either way , he is wrong . 
  unfortunately this news is about `` ma\u0142a ustawa reprywatyzacyjna '' from last year so it do n't change anything . 
  or warsaw , or moscow or even pyongyang . 
  the truth is that we do n't really know . 
  it is believed that the reason why black death did n't kill many people in poland ( compared to the rest of europe ) is combination of several factors . 
  1 ) relatively low population density ( but density was even lower in sweden or norway ) 2 ) relatively small cities ( but this also applies to scandinavia , ruthenia etc. ), 
  3 ) relatively high hygiene ( but again this also applies to scandinavia and ruthenia ) 4 ) at that time poland did n't have access to the sea - so no harbours ( but most of ruthenian principalities also did n't have harbours ) 5 ) an important reason could be that in almost all of europe ( except poland and few other places ) in that time were serious shortage in food . 
  hunger --  low immunity --  greater chance of catching a disease . 
  but like i said at the beginning - we do n't really know . 
  it 's always funny for me to see iran as largest threat to world peace . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's not the nicest country in the world but it is relatively stabile country . 
  for all city transport ( metro , trains , buses , trams ) - 1000z\u0142 - so it will be approximately 230 $ . 
  [ russia ] ( http://www.fullredneck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/funny-russia-meme-18.jpg ) is changing ... 
  according to this logic dresden is eastern european city . 
  only if you ignore hundreds of years of history and culture . 
  [ central europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) . 
  it was , is and will be . 
  eastern europe is too often confused with the eastern bloc . 
  poland was part of the eastern bloc but not eastern europe . 
  the same applies to many other countries such as czechia , slovakia , hungary etc. 
  poland is not eastern europe . 
  like u/h2ppyme said that was not the beginning . 
  it 's just too easy to joke about it . 
  the biggest irony in all of this is the fact that the prosecutor who contributed to his death died in 2004 at a hospital located on the street named after pilecki . 
   past 4 times i went on the bus i got stuck at the border for 8 hours . 
  it 's sooo boring . 
  praise the schengen !, 
  what `` wat '' ? 
  tell that to tatars . 
  no , it was n't . 
  but it still was more democratic than post-war prl . 
  i 'm suprised that we ( poland ) are above bulgaria , cyprus or ireland . 
   z kalu\u017ee do blata . 
  that 's nice . 
  we have similar - z deszczu pod rynn\u0119 . 
   hero being nkvd officer makes you hero nowadays ?
