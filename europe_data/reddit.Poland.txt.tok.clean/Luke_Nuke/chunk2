    i do n't have your impudence to teach germans that they should adopt similar principles . 
  i will not call for lowering german flag on masts after nye attacks , like you proposed with eu flags in countries that are indebted in germany . 
    please - be more restrained , and objective - for the seriousness of your office . 
    yours faithfully ,  zbigniew ziobro,

  source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_-xt_d-yl8 ( polish ) my rough translation :  interviewer : our guest is janusz korwin-mikke , president of korwin party , who we will ask about todays debate of european commission . 
   i : mr. president european commission decided about initiation of `` lawful state protection '' ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-poland-eu-idukkcn0ur1li20160113 ) procedure against poland today . 
  what does it mean for us actually ? 
   jkm : it means that they will be checking out if law is being obeyed in poland ... which means that if now we have a law passed by pis , they will be checking out if it is being obeyed i think , so it is quite strange procedure . 
  i 'd like to recall that all sanctions can be only imposed with universal consent of all eu countries ( i 'm saying countries and not states , because the only [ sovereign ] state is now union , to tell the truth ) . 
  because we know that mr victor orban will oppose this - we have nothing to worry about . 
   i : how do you assess statements of commissioner oettinger , mr martin schulz and mr frans timmermans about poland ? 
   jkm : i believe that everyone have a right to express their own opinions . 
  for example if someone will tell that usa is fascist state , at most ridicules himself ... or not , because for example i think that they have a lot of features of fascist state , so ... you can say that , and there is nothing to be offended by . 
  when i say this , i never heard about anyone in america to be offended by this . 
  we can not be too sensitive ... because poles are very sensitive . 
  when someone will say something wrong about poland , we instantly demand apologies - we should n't exaggerate . 
  it just tells about mr schulz or his knowledge of polish matters . 
   i : that is true , but many people demand public apologies and martin schulz is your personal enemy so i will keep asking . 
   jkm : well , i can not stand him , because i can not stand national socialists and he is a national socialist , in the sense of european nation of course , but i repeat - i wo n't demand apologies . 
  he said it and what ? 
  he could apologize if he would say something untrue in his own opinion , but if he think that he said the truth then ... what 's the matter ? 
   i : thanks . 
   i : [ unimportant outro ],

  to mods : the title used here is just literally translated title of linked movie . 
  source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm8zms6tg5g ( polish ) korwin is a bit chaotic here , but he does n't prepare his speeches . 
  anyway i think there are some interesting things  . 
  and as always , my rough and free translation :  `` now i will continue my short , 1-minute talk in european parliament , where i expressed true fear that band of ignorants tries to rule the europe . 
  they have no idea about not only economy , but also social processes , history , politics , simply - band of morons . 
  during communist times was being said ... the late stefan kisielewski used to say about `` reign of morons '' , here we can see the same , only even worse - at least those communists were educated in pre-war schools , and something left in their heads , but people here have only emptiness there . 
  they are lemmings , next to which polish lemmings are autonomous by comparison . 
  let 's think what is going on - what kind of selection happens . 
  formerly , we , white people , were ruling the world , because we had a selection - the best ones completed schools , the worst ones were thrown out from them . 
  fierce competition . 
  today precisely opposite mechanism has been constructed - the more someone is a moron , the more he is being cared about . 
  he is being intentionally added to the classroom , so he can hinder learning of talented kids . 
  it 's being said that we need to be humane , this moron can not be insulted , can not be called a moron etc. 
  i 'm sorry , but our nation needs to survive and we can not be brought to the level of idiots - `` who you stay with is who you become '' [ polish proverb ] . 
  if normal kids are ordered to stay with morons , and furthermore , they were told to treat their words with respect `` because they are also human beings '' , to treat them seriously , then i 'm sorry but idiots , like those from european parliament , have to appear . 
  they possibly also were going to schools like that , with integrated classes . 
  meanwhile there is a question - who is doing this intentionally ... because there are two possibilities - it is some unavoidable social process - death of white race , and we can not do anything about this , or this is fully intentional , and carefully thought through work - but who would want that ? 
  let 's see . 
  there are attempts on destroying white race . 
  children are not being born , it 's known why . 
  white race is being spoiled by various benefits , and immigrants are being brought in our place . 
  we have a publication by foundation of mr soros who tries to bring to europe as many immigrants as he can at all costs . 
  i think they are destined to replace white race , because they are less intelligent at average , so it will be even easier to rule them . 
  so , who 's behind all of this ? 
  there are suspicions that it is some internal organisation like freemasonry or illuminati , we do n't know who rules here . 
  maybe those are the same people who want to create this new world order - most of them possibly do n't even realize what they are really doing . 
  anyway , when mechanism of natural selection was disabled , the quality in every field dropped drastically and we need to do something about this . 
  if we do n't , then the first result will be that muslims will slaughter us , because they are still relatively normal . 
  they do n't have co-educational schools , they do n't put morons in classrooms intentionally , they teach their boys to be aggressive and not that aggressiveness is bad . 
  they win for certain , and then possibly even they will go extinct . 
  we need to do something . 
  let 's look at the stars . 
  why they are not talking to us ? 
  why there are no signals from other planets ? 
  maybe those processes occur everywhere , everywhere are appearing beings who want to unify everything and destroying this way mechanism of selection . 
  to be honest , it does n't need to be a conspiracy . 
  imagine herd of deer . 
  it is known that deer are in good condition , fast , agile - why ? 
  because wolves exist . 
  there is a threat of being eaten by wolves . 
  every year 10 % of deer are being eaten by wolves , and this threat causes the deer to be fast and agile . 
  but try to force deer to vote for existence of wolves in democracy . 
  this is impossible in democracy . 
  that is why we are dying . 
  i believe something can be done . 
  i believe that right-wing ideas wo n't convince majority , but will convince minority , 15 maybe 20 % of people , and minority that is aware of its purpose , can take the power - for example by the coup , or maybe because of economic collapse , and we will return on the way of development , and europe will rule the world once more . 
  thank you for your attention . '', 
  title of this post is just literally translated title of the video . 
  i present you my humble , exclusive , free translation . 
  janusz korwin-mikke is polish mep . 
  if you will see any important mistakes , please tell me and i will improve it . 
  source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhivq_qdfay ( polish )  ** interviewer : ** president of korwin party , janusz korwin-mikke is with us , and we will ask him for comments about words of mr jean-claude juncker who , very positively , commented immigration policy of angela merkel government . 
    ** i : ** mr president , i would like to cite you words of jean-claude juncker and ask you for your opinion : `` the european migration policies she and i are pursuing will prevail . 
  it is political strength to say we can do it . 
  anything else is capitulation to the populists . '', 
  ( source : http://europe.newsweek.com/angela-merkel-history-vindicate-jean-claude-juncker-427611?rm=eu )   ** janusz korwin-mikke : ** i , of course , agree that when i 'm protesting mrs merkel and mr juncker doings , i appeal to populists [ probably means people ] , but who should i appeal to , if elites went crazy . 
  it 's the situation known from communism , so-called `` tram theory '' , which tells that in random warsaw tram we can find better government than the one currently ruling . 
  the same situation exists currently in european union . 
  elites in european parliament etc. 
  are simply stupid , european loons . 
  in this situation we have to appeal to common people , because to who otherwise ? 
  i would mostly like to appeal to army , but european union does n't have any army , which could intervene and restore order , therefore counter-revolution is impossible , but we need to remove them somehow , because they lead the europe to destruction . 
  now ... and this is something related to current situation with mr lech wa\u0142\u0119sa [ more here : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35602437 ] , when it will come out how eec [ european economic community ] was changed into ec [ european community ] and then into eu , then round table is irrelevant compared to that . 
  this will come out someday . 
  if you are interested i can recommend you my old comments or you can search for rudi dutschke on wikipedia . 
  there , more or less , you can guess . 
  these are all agents - these people that are currently ruling the european union . 
    ** i : ** you mentioned that you have to appeal to common people , in germany support for cdu/csu is waning , but despite of this , mr juncker tells that mrs merkel policy will defend itself against critics , and that history will judge her positively . 
    ** jkm : ** it all depends on what we mean by `` positively '' . 
  there are people who argue that huns invasions were beneficial for dying civilization , because on its place appeared new civilization of goths , vandals etc. 
  and roman empire fell , but because it was already rotten , the faster it fell the better . 
  so you can argue that thanks to mrs merkel , on the place of rotten west culture , the culture of islam will flourish , and i think the history is being written by those who have power , and muslim historians will praise mrs merkel for her wise policy which allowed islam to triumph on the ruins of europe . 
    ** i : ** mr president let 's return to european matters ... this morning minister szyma\u0144ski told that we have never been so close to disintegration of schengen area , but he also told that it paradoxically does n't need to be so bad , because it would help with protecting external borders of european union . 
    ** jkm : ** if we want to maintain schengen , which of i 'm a big supporter ( because i hate european union but schengen is natural and we need to maintain it ) , then of course we need to protect external borders . 
  but for this purpose it 's not required for german troops to be there , but simply pay well greeks , italians etc.
