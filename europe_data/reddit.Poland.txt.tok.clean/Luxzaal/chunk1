poorer countries grow faster than poorer countries ? 
  my , the crisis is turning the tables rather quickly , 
  but of course . 
  i wonder what can be done in light of recent developments . . 
  whatever floats their boat , i guess . . 
  i 'm just happy that me and everyone else from around the world can see the richness of our history , whether it was a painful one or a thing to be proud of . 
  the memory shall live on , after all . 
  oh irony , you clever lady . . 
  i thought of teatrum mundi concept but maybe you 're right , 
  it 's ** all ** about the money , money , money we ** do ** need your money , money , money we just wan na make the world dance , remember ` bout the price tag . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/palestine_recognition_only.svg interesting that most of the developed countries are not willing to recognise the state . 
  bulgaria is present in harry potter universe  and they have nice coast , too . 
  especially ` crime and punishment ' and ` the idiot ', 
  i love austria for its lakes and cuisine . 
  italy also has remarkable food ( my visits to sardinia and sicily were definitely worthwile ) . 
  germany has amazing cities which emulate that ` cosmopolitan ' feel - berlin comes to mind for example . 
  switzerland has great views everywhere . 
  and i really enjoy visiting slovakia 's castles - they are very impressive and not too crowded . 
  come to think of it . . where is bratusek ? 
  and positive energy bulc < 3, 
  ah , i see now . 
  thanks for a thorough input . 
  so , what is letta doing these days ? 
  i 'm really intersted in how you see his rise to power over there in italy . 
  i heard that he betrayed his friend letta ( then pm ) and took control over the governing party and the government itself . 
  for me it was very weird that nothing was done with that , or maybe letta was very unpopular ? 
  it 's just i thought that he was a rather good pm and also represented the younger generstion of politicians . 
  and renzi . . well i do n't know much about him but it 's just his behaviour when i see him on tv that 's ticking me off . 
  with presidental and general elections due in the next year , there is a lot of talk in our country about the possible outcome of the two . 
  well , one to be exact , because komorowski is almost sure to be reelected as the president ( 80 % approval in the latest poll and rather stable ) . 
  as to who will lead the government . . two options , really - if po wins yet again , then it 's probably kopacz who will continue the work . 
  or maybe , if enough poles decide to stay at home and not care about the people who will be ruling , then kaczy\u0144ski will return ( yay ) . 
  and that means fun at the european council summits ( we meet again , mr. tusk ) . 
  it 's really a matter of choosing between pro-european and centric ruling party and conservative pis from the opposition . 
  the others do n't really matter in my opinion . 
  people are angry at some things ( corruption scandals , problems with healthcare , raising the retirement age ) , but if they look at the opposition , it 's nothing better . 
  pis tries to look competent , but then there are always mps there who talk about ` smolensk assassination 2010 ' and present the case of exploding sausage as the evidence to prove something about the explosions onboard . 
  so people stick to the ` lesser evil ' who has its share of misdeeds but also fast gdp growth and many infrastructural projects ( thanks to the eu funds but you have to spend them in a proper way , too ) . 
  i really do n't know what will happen but people are probably afraid to change the status quo which seems to be working and is not something obvious in our country . 
  the joy of elections , 
  nah , we invaded russia up to the moscow ( and stayed there for a year i think ) . 
  sorry i may be missing the point , but . . 
  i reckon that the only i ever heard of were 6 of them . . and that 's what has been told numeorus times . 
  now if i look there or on the english wiki site i see the number more than doubled . 
  i understand that they are counting the people born at the time on the territory of said country and neglecting the fact that they may have changed their nationality later . 
  so what is the ` correct ' way to count one country 's nobel laureates ? 
  now i know that poland may be a specific case owing to the rebirth of the state only in 1918 and subsequent change of borders . 
  can anyone shed some light on this ? 
  weird . . you seldom ever hear of things like this in our media . . 
  it 's always just ` ohh kopacz took the wrong direction on the red carpet does this mean our reputation abroad is ruined ( one opposition mp really said that ! ) . 
  i just wish people in our country were more interested in the eu affairs . .  about the topic at hand . . well i reckon that the french would have way less problems now if they decided as soon as the problem arose on what to do - whether they want to sell or not . 
  sure , it 's cracking the eu solidarity , but i understand that , especially during the crisis now , the french government wants to complete the contract . 
  umm , the witcher comes from poland , actually . 
  hello !, 
  that may be a bit naive question , but was it hard for you to get where you are right now ? 
  did you plan on becoming interpreter ? 
  is the job satisfactory for you ? 
  i agree , people will try to use anything to blame the ruling party , which will lose anyway . 
  i agree it could have been done earlier to avoid this awkward turnabout at the last minute , but i also do n't feel like we should apologise to anyone . 
  every country first and foremost acts in their own best interest , which was shown in the earlier cases of ukraine/russia , south stream and carbon emissions ( iirc we were left as the only one opposing this ) . 
  there was no ` v4 solidarity ' there , so why now we have to apologise ? 
  the case , unlike some others , was lost anyway and we got what we wanted ( at least they tell us so ... ) . 
  i welcome the cooperation of v4 , but we should n't now project the image of the group as a solid bloc , because there are differences , and they will remain . 
  ultimately , i think that sometimes it is better to agree with the despised ` mainstream ' of europe . 
  i thought that at the meeting earlier they admitted to having ` differences ' when it comes to the tackling of the crisis ? 
  you really have n't considered the fact that mostly vocal opposers vote in polls like that ? 
  i 'm not even shocked anymore by these results and comments underneath . 
  i would say that it 's 50 % for accepting refugees and 50 % against , so pretty even . 
  also the quote with cutting the heads off . . am i to be proud that i am in the supposed 10 % of the population not supporting this ? 
  lithuania is for if i remeber correctly . 
  gdansk as in city or connection to get there ? 
  the connection is good and the city is fantastic , regardless of what you seek to do  on the other hand , the connections east from warsaw are , from my experience , rather bad , but maybe someone else can correct me . 
  very cool , the brasov one is gold . 
  ferragosto in italy . 
  i was on a vacation in a hotel on sardinia and on the evening of the 15th of august they made a big party with lots of great food and nice atmosphere . 
  doubt all of the hotels in the country do this , but it is something to remember for a long time . 
  ` slovak finance minister peter kazimir hailed the decision , saying it was helped by his country being a member of the euro zone , unlike some central european neighbours . ', 
  well played . 
  do n't mean to brag , but out of curiosity i looked up poland on the same site . 
  truly astounding . 
  i do n't like duda , but i think that the author is exaggerating a bit . 
  angora always does something like this , it 's meant to be a lighthearted approach to current main stories , although one can question the sense of humour in some cases . 
  could someone eli5 why they ca n't agree on a referendum similar to the scottish one ? 
  i suspect the majority is for independence , but would n't the voting be better than constant fights ? 
  i respect that she does n't believe in them , not everyone has to , but i 'm not sure if personal beliefs should have an impact on the legislation . 
  yes , because we need to have even more institutions and spend more on things like this . . 
  true , it 's only that i 've read somewhere that merkel specifically did n't like him and so wanted someone else . 
  i thought he was labeled as ` incompetent ' and ` annoying ' some time ago ? 
  is it expected to continue falling in the longer term ? 
  if i remember correctly , the article was comparing the growth of spain and poland 's populations , with the former said to be ` growing steadily ' and expected to rather quickly reach 50 mil , and the latter expected to have accelerating shrinking of population ( emigration , lower birth rate ) . 
  it was from the last year , but i will try to find it . 
  i thought they would be growing , i think i 've even read an article about the subject . 
  i guess that 's not longer the case ? 
  it is as hated as some of the right-wing newspapers , so that 's not any indicator . 
  weak as the article may be , it would be wise to start some kind of campaign as we wo n't always remain a secluded fortress . 
  - / a/an/the was really tough for me , and is for many people in poland , as we lack something like this in our language . 
  most people do n't really bother with this , and some teachers tell that even natives make mistakes with a/the , so it is not that important . 
  it looks very nice what with that blue , great job !, 
  did we really need them ? 
  they are simply too distracting and do not add anything of value .
