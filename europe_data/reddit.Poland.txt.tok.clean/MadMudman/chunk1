it is always good when populists lose - good work finland , 
  i have nothing against him pushing macron from 1st to 2nd place and le pen from 2nd place to 3rd, 
  wo n't he finally shut up ? 
  i hope for a `` miracle '' and melenchon taking over le pen ... she is not untouchable , some polls a few months earlier indicated that second round showdown between macron and juppe was possible if francois fillon withdrew and was replacec by juppe, 
  `` suspicious package found at crimea station of moscow 's central ring - everybody evacuated '' so , judging by the name ... ukraine related ? 
  the source may be controversial , but it 's the only article in english i found, 
  maybe i do n't understand a basic thing , but why is suomenlahti in 2016 listed twice ? 
  but erdogan is on the list, 
  yes i know they are important people that are missing , but i decided to focus only on with country leaders on this list , 
  sure  i was planning on adding every european leader but then i thought 30 was already a bit too much ... but obviously i was wrong :d, 
  take a good look , europe . 
  this is what happens when you elect far-right populists . 
  yes . 
  for example this guy from a few days ago certainly wad muslim https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/11/man-charged-with-gbh-after-east-london-acid-attack, 
  yes , olympic games are indeed at the same level of importance as world championships , possibly even bigger , 
  sorry for bad spelling of formatting - writing from a tablet world league - played every year , format similar to ice hockey world championships but a bit more complicated : 36 teams in three divisions -12 teams in each - plus european league as a qualifying tournament . 
  the teams are then participating in small pools of 4 teams . 
  those pools change every week , however what counts is the overall , joint ranking of the whole division . 
  2 and 3 top three teams overall plus host participate in semifinals and final to determine the best team which gets promotion to the higher division . 
  division 1 has a final 6 tournament which consists of the top 5 teams and host . 
  first the teams are splitted into 2 groups of 3 teams , then finally the two best teams play semifinals and medal matches . 
  might sound overly complicated , but it 's actually pretty easy to follow  world championsips - the most important tournament . 
  something like football world cup . 
  takes place every 4 years , after 3 year long qualification process which determines the best 23 teams which will play the championships ( plus hosts ) . 
  the qualification period is long because there are many national teams competinng ( almost 150 national teams took part in 2014 wc qualifications ) . 
  like in football , each continental federation may only send a limited ammount of teams . 
  world cup - something like confederations cup , but qualifies 2 best teams to olympic games . 
  fixed host - japan hosted almost all editions - there are 2 teams from each continent participating , also the host and world champion . 
  they play single round robin . 
  possibly the most difficult tournament , as the teams have to play 11 games in 14 days , and the tournament uses rotating host cities system , which means the playrers also have to travel in between the matches .

  remember , they are the good guys who will keep europe safe from terrorism / s, 
  fed up with what ? 
  with innocent people praying ? 
  because he did not target any extremist or terrorist . 
  he wanted to kill people just because of who they are . 
  he is not any different from isis . 
  he may claim he hates islamic state , but if he was born and raised in syria or iraq , he probably would be one of the first to join . 
  he did ? 
  everything is cool then . 
  happy day for freedom :d, 
  actually , polish right wingers commenting on fb page of a center-left newspaper `` gazeta wyborcza '' are happy this happened . 
  `` britons fighting back '' , `` i am not sorry for those filthy people '' are just some of the least disturbing comments ... 
  good results . 
  t.may wo n't have majority and 0 seats for ukip, 
  schizophrenic guy # 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec_city_mosque_shooting schizophrenic guy # 3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollh\u00e4ttan_school_attack schizophrenic guy # 4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_jo_cox and many more i dont have the time or patience to write down `` religion founded by warriors and marauders who have inspired countless acts of mass murder iin just the last few decades '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ku_klux_klan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_liberation_front_of_tripura https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%27s_resistance_army the last 2 are basically christian isis . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_portland_train_attack i could only imagine what would people like you say if the attacker was a `` brown '' dude that instead of insulting muslims would insult christians before killing two people . 
  because i sure as heck can imagine what you want to say now : `` this was not a terror attack , he was just mentally disturbed , probably supported sanders , blah-blah-blah '', 
  let me guess . . ` murikan , right :d pretty dumb question after all the `` incidents '' that happened in us of a since d. trump took office that would have been classified as terrorist acts if only the guys commiting them would shout alkach akbar at the time, 
  90 dead just a few days ago ... 
  only ireland ? 
  i would say our government , and more and more every day , seems to be really inspired by iran 's islamic revolution in their world view . 
  `` niedalekiej '' also means `` near '' :d probably `` w kr\u00f3tkiej przysz\u0142o\u015bci '' sounds better but seems not right gramatically, 
  you always did, 
  emmanuel emmanuel emmanuel < 3, 
  omg , guys ... we have full trumpist leak over here ... 
  go grab 'em by the pussy big boy xd, 
  rotfl . 
  le pen had about 5 % support in paris in the first turn, 
  still , this allowed them to take over pis which clearly is losing support . 
  probably in 2019 , but voices calling for a snap election get more and more loud, 
  not cool ;( give us one more chance . . po for the first time since 2015 is in front of pis in opinion pols , maybe we 're slowly waking up , 
  wow , the difference between le pen and fillon may be even closer then predicted ... after counting 81 % of votes le pen has 22,65 % while fillon 19,71 % . 
  meanwhile , in no exit poll fillon scored higher than 20 %, 
  ... and macron in front in the http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/fe.html vote count  ) ), 
  actually the last line from steffen seibert 's tweet would ( roughly translated ) be more like `` best wishes/good luck for the next 2 weeks '' . 
  i know that does n't really sound like this , but not every sentence has the same context in every language , 
  after 31/107 districts counted macron 23 % le pen 22 % melenchon 19,6 % fillon 19,1 %, 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/apr/23/french-presidential-election-results-2017-latest you just have to manually refresh, 
  after 22/107 districts counted macron 22.34 % le pen 22.28 % melenchon 20.16 % fillon 19.70 %, 
  lol imagine filon taking over le pen in the exit polls and at the same time le pen leading official polls ... 
  it seems more likely for fillon who is right now only 1.8 % behind le pen in kantar sofres poll , while at 20:00 it was 4 %, 
  guys , please remember these are not the official results . 
  the vote count is in progress , and kantar , harris and elabe polls have been updated at 21:00 , with le pen losing votes in all of them . 
  ! edit !, 
  for those asking for links , the easiest way would be to simply use the wikipedia page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017 you have the updates basically on top of the table, 
  are there any live vote-counts available ? 
  any chance the second placed person will change, 
  well , remeber that even if mlp was not amongst french-belgians top2 choices it does n't mean she wo n't be in the second turn . 
  it 's votes in france that count the most . 
  but i would be one of the people who would scream `` yay '' the most if that were true, 
  francja , if yuo of electings le pens and frexing ue breakings polan is will be of bullied by the evil rosja-clay again ; - ; ploax very beaucoup :( if yuo wo n't polan will of be cleanings the toilets for yuo instead of the traitor britain !, 
  i am sooo stuned by le pen scoring so low . 
  can someone who is more into this stuff explain me if this was to be expected , or is this at least a bit surprising ? 
  this is not even funny . 
  stuff like that may actually get someone hurt or killed because `` dem filthy brown moooslems makin ' fun of ar tragedy again '', 
  what is important is this poll was done after yesterday 's event , so it shows how it managed to change french people 's view on the candidate the news are quite calming : marine le pen has 23 % of support , but it 's worth noting that her results in last 5 odoxa polls were higher or comparable : 22 % -23 % -23 % -25 % -26 % macron 's trend was ( in % ) 24,5-23-24 ,5 -26 -26,5 - fillon 's 19-17 ,5 -18 -18,5 -19 melenchon 's 19-19-18-16-10 ,5 however it should be also noted that they polls are done on a relatively small ammount of people ( about 950 ), 
  sunday 23rd april, 
  well , it is possible too , but tbh aside from the major error in 2002 i do n't remember french pollsters being that wrong ( i am no expert though , so maybe someone french will correct me ) . 
  usually they predictions have been rather correct i believe . 
  of course it 's not impossible those `` hidden voters '' will help her advance to the second round , or even win the first one - however then any other candidate has a huuuge advantage over her and i do n't think this much ( in most polls it 's at least 20 % of participants ) would hide their voting intentions . 
  fillon or melenchon could be underestimated too - the same thing happened to le pen 's father in 2002, 
  let me just re-post what i said yesterday it 's a strange situation . 
  terrorist attack rather do n't seem to change people 's election choices in the way that some far-right politicians gain support after such events while others lose . . 
  however it may drift people who were already considering voting for her to do it , while making other people includin her unsure supporters confident she is trying to do `` politics while bathing in blood '' again to vote for anyone but her . 
  second round prognosis macron 65-35 le pen macron 59-41 melenchon macron 65-35 fillon melenchon 60-40 le pen melenchon 56-44 fillon fillon 59-41 le pen, 
  and i guarantee we would be having 99 % less terrorist attacks ( see , i have the same `` proof '' you do ) as until the american invasion the middle east was much more peaceful than for example the yugoslavia . 
  literally the first link http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bush-god-told-me-to-invade-iraq-6262644.html `` i 'm driven with a mission from god . 
  god would tell me , ` george , go and fight those terrorists in afghanistan . ', 
  and i did , and then god would tell me , ` george go and end the tyranny in iraq , ' and i did . '',
