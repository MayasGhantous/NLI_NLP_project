  polish reddit - wykop.pl is now 90 % about the migrant crisis and muslims . 
  now his party says that he meant that there are 54 districts with sharia customs , not official obligatory law . 
  the only thing i do n't like in these photos are the [ asphalt sidewalks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxlsfji.jpg ) . 
  in poland it ended in the 90s and now most of these sidewalks are in [ bad condition ] ( http://www.wpr24.pl/img/zdjecia/foto_old/chodnik_osiedle_parkowa_dp.jpg ) . 
  now almost every sidewalk is made from paving bricks [ like here ] ( http://host1010.vpo7.iat.pl/mfiles/283/3/2406/f/img_0662.jpg ) . 
  no :d there are mostly soft sounds in this poem . 
  and btw polish `` z '' sounds like german `` s '' . 
  but it sounds beautiful when you read it aloud :d, 
  ftfy : poland was kind of a bully in the ~ ~ 18th ~ ~ 16th/17th century and in the interwar period . 
  i think '' \u00f3 '' in this picture is a different sound than polish '' \u00f3 '' which sounds like english `` oo '' . 
  no , you 're the 10th country in europe by population . 
  i always leave about 10 % in restaurant or just round up the price . 
  yeah , poland lost independence in the worst possible moment . 
  about 50 years later industrial revolution started along with the global companies . 
  for example galicia had no industry , austria treated it as the agriculture part of the empire . 
  furthermore nationalistic movements started in xix century so if poland resisted couple years more it would have been way harder to partition us ... 
  squatting is a former soviet states thing , not slavic . 
  in west slavic countries we squat as much as in western europe . 
  do you live in suwa\u0142ki ? 
  last time with -20 c longer than one night was over 10 years ago . 
  it must be related to poland becuase digraph `` rz '' exists only there . 
  [ furthermore many men from poland have this surname ] ( http://www.myheritage.pl/research?formid=master&amp;formmode&amp;action=query&amp;exactsearch=0&amp;qname=name+ln.gorzka&amp;oft&amp;sab&amp;utm_source=partner_verwandt&amp;utm_medium=redirect_karten&amp;utm_campaign=www.moikrewni.pl ) .

  total = 14 * poland * germany * czech republic * slovakia * ukraine * austria * hungary * croatia * serbia * bosnia and herzegovina * montenegro * switzerland * liechtenstein * france, 
  be humanitarian - they are refugees ... 
  additionally , we have 1,75 l cola in strange bottle which afaik is sold only in biedronka ( the biggest chain of supermarkets in poland ) . 
  i do n't know what exactly hesburger is but places like mcdonald 's , kfc or burger king make cola from syrup . 
   jacksonville i used to listen to limp bizkit in early ' 00s and somehow i still remember that 's the city where lb formed . 
  unfortunately , that 's all i know :d, 
  [ my family 's small collection ] ( http://i.imgur.com/62bffrb.jpg ), 
   oldtimer -  vintage car we use this word too . 
  that letter for `` rz '' looks harder to write than simple `` rz '' or '' \u017c '', 
  in some regions of poland it 's more important day than birthday . 
  the last sentence is not true . 
  i think some pole said that and now everyone is repeating it . 
  this map proves otherwise . 
  poles and the other west slavs squat as much as people in western europe . 
  it 's rather popular in the former ussr countries , not only among slavs . 
  no , it 's just warsaw in the middle of the poor region . 
  warsaw should be a separate voivodeship anyway like in the other countries . 
  hehe no , deus ex is pronounced exactly the same as in english :d i think you read it in hungarian way :d, 
  there 's at least one vowel in almost every syllable in polish . 
  poles also ca n't pronounce `` cdz '' ( c is like `` ts '' and `` dz '' is similar to `` j '' in `` joke '' ) because in the word above , the number is a set of combined words so for example `` dziewi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0105tdziewi\u0119\u0107miliard\u00f3wdziewi\u0119\u0107 '' is pronounced as `` dziewi\u0119\u0107-dziesi\u0105t-dziewi\u0119\u0107-miliard\u00f3w-dziewi\u0119\u0107 '' ( 99000000009 ) . 
  `` wdz ' is similar but there is one natural word like `` wdzi\u0119k '' which is not that hard to pronounce ( `` w '' like `` v '' , `` dz '' like `` g '' in `` giraffe '' ) . 
  many consonant chains are just two or more words combined together and there is a noticeable pause between them . 
  because you probably saw only the polish tongue twisters . 
  polish has as many vowels as any slavic language ( ofc when spoken ) . 
  this is how poland should look after ww2 ( map with interesting statistics ) : http://i.imgur.com/xb3tqjf.png, 
  no , they are related to the slavic ow : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/namen_auf_-ow compare the map of the - ow town names in germany with the map of west slavs in the 10th century : http://i.imgur.com/xsobtzi.jpg, 
  this name has slavic origin ( the `` ow '' ending ) like many places in the northeastern germany because about 1000 years ago there were many slavic settlements . 
  for me it 's impossible to mix these sounds . 
  the third s ( sz ) is actually \u0161 , \u015b is like the soft version of s . we also have the other z - \u017c / rz or \u017a ( hard and soft ) and the other l ( \u0142 ) - like w in english . 
  the soft n also has a special letter - \u0144 . 
  ` y ' is always a vowel in polish and ` rz ' , ` sz ' or ` cz ' represents one sound so other than that , there 're not that many consonants ( like in that sentence example , which would be written like ` vizheche zhichlivie i za viele ' using the english alphabet ) . 
  it 's like complaining english has just consonants jammed together because there 're often ` sh ' , ` ch ' or ` th ' . 
  when i was listening to the other slavic languages i noticed that polish does n't have that many cz / \u010d , rz / \u017c / \u017e or sz / \u0161 sounds compared to them . 
  for example \u010d is more popular in eastern slavic languages . 
  maybe the reason people have that opinion is because we have one additional sound - \u015b which for us is completely different from sz / \u0161 but somehow many foreigners are pronouncing it exactly like sz / \u0161 . 
  the other reason could be that many surnames or town names use archaic words which have no real meaning today but use for example \u0161\u010d / szcz combos - like b\u0142aszczykowski ( pronounced bwaschikovski - i personally do n't know what it means :d ) . 
  [ and the crime map .

   the move comes at a time when poland is stepping up its own defenses by calling thousands of reservists for urgent military training ( ... ) not thousands but 500 . 
  my grandma is from silesia and she says `` na pole '' . 
  interesting , in polish cerkiew is eastern christian church and ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 is rather catholic . 
  it 's not that bad . 
  in my class many students were doing homework or learning for the tests during these classes . 
  it was like a long break when you can talk or complete your homework from someone 's else exercise book . 
  the teacher was talking mostly about biblical stories , nothing about abortion or evolution . 
  you can resign from religion classes so it 's not that bad as problemy wrote . 
  loud ? 
  when i 'm for example in bus in krakow the foreign tourists are always the loudest group , poles sit silent or talk very quiet . 
  according [ to this ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qocmd/map_trust_in_the_eu/ ) poland is probably the least euro-skeptic country in eu . 
  i remember that other polls looked similar . 
  what does this article have to do with polish government ? 
  us and germany did n't want bases in poland also when previous government , po , had been ruling the country for 8 years . 
  yes , but only in slavic languages . 
  i think german also had the `` sz '' digraph . 
  i always thought that 's why we adopted it, 
  no , rz or \u017c is the zh sound . 
  not only eastern slavic but every slavic native speaker , maybe besides bulgarian , which afaik has articles . 
  i think he was describing krak\u00f3w :d, 
  youtube comments, 
  you think that because of that popular image of google autocomplete in china where for poland there was something like `` why poland hates china '' ? 
  or people in china really got that idea somewhere else ? 
  i do n't recall anything particular that would make poland dislike your country . 
  there are gypsies from bulgaria in many cities in poland selling clothes on markets and people call them bu\u0142garzy ( bulgarians ) :d, 
  list from some voting in newspaper : 10 . 
  `` ruchaj '' ( imperative mood of one of the colloquial words for having sex ) 9 . 
  `` kochanka '' ( `` lover '' { fem . } ), 
  `` sraczka '' ( `` the runs '' ) 6 . 
  `` cipa '' ( `` cunt '' ) 2 . 
  `` co\u015b '' ( `` something '' ) 1 . 
  [ `` cyps albo zyps '' ] ( http://e.pardon.pl/pa555/e388ced0002d366549aecf9b ) it means `` cyps or zyps '' ( cyps and zyps do n't mean anything particular ) . 
  it looks like someone was n't sure how to spell this surname and told somebody : `` write it as cyps or zyps '' :d, 
  [ yes , it 's true . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29#destruction_of_the_commonwealth ) when you read a board next to almost every castle ruins in poland , the story ends with `` object destroyed during swedish invasion '' . 
  drinking in public is illegal in poland :d, 
  you 're right but in other situations it 's a different sound . 
  the examples with ` rz ' after ` p ' , ` t ' , ` k ' , ` ch ' are there because in polish the ` r ' sound changed to ` rz ' in many words centuries ago ( unlike other slavic languages where after ` p ' , ` t ' , ` k ' , ` ch ' there is very rarely the ` rz ' sound ) and it 's difficult to pronounce ` rz ' after these letters . 
  i think that 's why we have two letters for the same sound ( ` rz ' and ' \u017c ' ) - in words where there was ` r ' we use ` rz ' and in other words ( for example words with foreign origin like \u017cyrafa ) we use ' \u017c ' .
