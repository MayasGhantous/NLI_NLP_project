  ` rz ' and ` sz ' are completely different sounds :d ` sz ' is like english ` sh ' and ` rz ' or ' \u017c ' is like ` zh ' ( ` g ' letter in mirage ) . 
  [ most slavic and baltic languages have over 5 cases \\ ( + finland :d \\ ) ] ( http://wals.info/feature/49a#4/49.84/30.10 ), 
  at least we know the gender of someone posting on sites like reddit and do n't have to ask about it :d, 
  ' \u0448 ' is ` sz ' not ` rz ' :d btw why poles would want to use cyrillic ? 
  almost every language that uses latin alphabet has digraphs like in polish ( but instead of ` sz ' they have ` sh ' or ` sch ' ) and for example ' \u0436 ' looks harder to write than \u017c / rz :d, 
  i do n't think we use more \u0161 's and \u010d 's than other slavic languages ( i can agree with \u017e 's because of many words where r became rz / \u017c ) . 
  i think that for example russian has way more \u010d sounds . 
  maybe you have this impression because we also have \u015b and \u017a which are softened \u0161 's and \u017e 's ( \u015b is like the sound of a snake , \u0161 / sz is more like the sound of a hair dryer :d ) and for most people outside poland they sound very similar . 
  also this kind of szcz combos are often in archaic words like surnames or town names which do n't mean anything particular but foreigners see surnames like b\u0142aszczykowski or towns like szczecin ( i do n't know the origin of these names :d ) . 
  besides in slavic languages with \u0161 / \u010d letters , the accents are often omitted during translation . 
  for me as a pole they are completely different sounds , \u0107 / \u015b is way softer . 
  foreigners always mix them up and they also tend to pronounce these sounds harsher - they use the english `` ch '' sound which is slightly different than cz / \u010d . 
  yeah i bet there were many immigrants in that private school in switzerland . 
  i agree , i have to admit i 've recently discovered that whatsapp and snapchat is not the same app :d btw it 's funny to see itt that in some countries almost everyone ( young and old people ) uses whatsapp and in other regions ( like norway or some countries in ee ) no one heard of it . 
  maybe that 's because in places like poland there are unlimited text messages for some time and people do n't like to have three apps/accounts to do the same thing . 
  everyone has facebook account so people here just use it to communicate . 
  so your ears have eyes ? 
  syli d\u017cermans hef tu rajt fri leters for dys s\u0105d : `` sch '' :d, 
   also upokojiti se means to retire from work in polish `` uspok\u00f3j si\u0119 '' means `` calm down '' :d, 
  how can our sz or cz prevent us from singing this song ? 
  it 's only a difference in spelling the same sounds you have :d or if you thought there is a polish version of this song - no , there probably is n't :d, 
  they have e-refugees . 
  youth unemployment rate in bosnia-herzegovina is over 55 % so it 's better to work abroad than doing nothing in your country . 
  from university of warsaw website :  three scientists from the uw have cooperated in the discovery of gravitational waves . 
  the research has confirmed a major prediction of einstein 's general theory of relativity . 
  prof. tomasz bulik and prof. krzysztof belczy\u0144ski have been working on astrophysical sources of gravitational waves . 
  they are the authors of predictions that the first sources are two black holes . 
  dr izabela kowalska-leszczy\u0144ska has been analyzing the data in the research group . 
  [ more info \\ ( in english \\ ) ] ( http://en.uw.edu.pl/discovery-of-gravitational-waves/ ) btw poland has [ one of a few ] ( http://tds.ego-gw.it/itf/members_db/private/institut_list.php ) groups ( [ polgraw ] ( https://polgraw.camk.edu.pl/ ) ) in the virgo scientific collaboration which cooperated with ligo . 
  it 's always easy to tell that this type of map is wrong in case of poland because people living in the western poland are mostly from the areas in the western ukrane and belarus who moved west after the ww2 . 
  but the maps always show a smooth transition . 
  it 's the same in poland - `` morsy '' groups in every city :d, 
  rzeka is not the same as reka . 
  z is there for a reason . 
  rz is the zh sound . 
  we have even another letter for this sound - \u017c but because of the historical and grammatical reasons we have to remember when to use each version . 
  it probably had different pronunciation . 
  btw reka would be too close to r\u0119ka ( hand , \u0119 is like nasal e , sounds similar to renka ) . 
  what ? 
  i see situations like on this picture everyday . 
  in polish the adjectives are also always lowercase . 
  nowy s\u0105cz is fighting with smog . 
  yes , w is always pronounced as english v , \u0141 is english w , c is english ts and polish , unlike english , is pronounced phonetically so there is n't any additional o before r . you pronounce wroc\u0141aw as you see it . 
  tvn and tvp must regret now that they were making fun of korwin :d, 
  more accurate version : vrots-wav, 
  zakopane is not a major city :d it 's a major tourist city with only 25k inhabitants but afaik 200k visitors during , for example , new year 's eve . 
  it 's broi\u0107 actually and it means to frolic . 
  it 's connected with zbroi\u0107 ( to arm ) , zbroja ( armor ) , rozbraja\u0107 ( to defuse ) , uzbrojony ( armed ) , zbrojenie ( reinforcement ) etc. 
  zurek is like white borscht . 
  there is a [ pilecki movie released in 2015 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5145444/ ) but it 's very bad . 
  it 's also a normal working day in poland , i doubt many people know that there 's some kind of holiday in us . 
  it was valid in the 17th and 18th century ... 
  in the wiki article you linked :  any single member of the polish parliament during the 17th and 18th century had an absolute veto ( latin : liberum veto ) , meaning that decisions could often only be made with great difficulty . 
  now our parliament is most often very calm . 
  in poland everyone thinks it 's a polish stereotype :d, 
  solorz-\u017bak is now the richest pole :d, 
  we have normal `` l '' and `` w '' is already taken so we had to invent '' \u0141 '' . 
  `` sz '' is still better than german `` sch '' . 
  it 's like complaining that english has `` sh '' instead of special letter . 
  i think i 've read somewhere that it very rarely rains on 1.11 and honestly i do n't remember rain on this day . 
  but there was snow a few years ago :d, 
  if you live in a bigger polish city , especially warsaw and krak\u00f3w , it 's even harder to buy your own house because the prices are way higher than in the rest of the country . 
  btw most of the 20-29 years old people study in poland not move abroad ... 
  latvia is '' \u0141otwa '' not `` lotwa '' which makes it way easier to distinguish them ( '' \u0141 '' is like english `` w '' so '' \u0141otwa '' is pronounced `` woh-tva '' , while litwa is just `` lee-tva '' ), 
  that 's why it 's should be called `` soviet-squat '' - it 's not popular in western slavic countries but mostly in post-soviet states . 
  or #januszlive :d, 
  if you 're a native speaker you do n't think about it becuase there are only one or two words like tarzan . 
  i can only think of marzn\u0105\u0107 ( to freeze ) and its various forms . 
  when it comes to \u017c / rz - it sounds the same . 
  words that have an `` r '' letter after declination or in other forms , are written with `` rz '' ( like morze - sea and morski - maritime ) . 
  `` rz '' also used to be prononced like a soft `` r '' hundreds years ago , unlike '' \u017c '' which sounded like today . 
  '' \u017b '' is used where the other forms of a word have g , h , s , dz or z ( like mog\u0119 - i can and mo\u017ce - he/she can ) and it is used in foreign words like \u017cyrafa ( giraffe ) . 
  we also have '' \u0179 '' ( with accent , not dot like in '' \u017b '' ) :d it sounds like soft '' \u017b '' ( like `` si '' in vision ) . 
  it 's like `` zh '' . 
  i do n't get why people keep complaining about digraphs like `` cz '' or `` sz '' while english uses `` ch '' and `` sh '' so it 's the same situation , only `` z '' is replaced with `` h '' . 
  then we have german with `` tsch '' and `` sch '' :d, 
  [ that 's not true . 
  ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/warszawa/na-mazowszu-zabrzmia-syreny-alarmowe/nmx4n1 ) even the sirens used to celebrate warsaw uprising were heard in the whole masovian voivodeship and were treated as the test of the siren system . 
  there are siren system tests every few months , at least in the mazovian voivedoship . 
  this argument again ... pis is not going to ban abortions . 
  so just like in the slavic languages . 
  in poland there 's been about 20c for a week so i think it will be the first july with lower mean temp than 1 year before :d, 
  the article says `` today '' not 1945 ... 
  you spell that `` koscielny '' :d in polish it would be written as `` ko\u015bcielny '' and it 's [ easy to pronounce ] ( https://translate.google.com/#auto/pl/ko%c5%9bcielny ) . 
  we have about 8 news channels but only one ( public broadcaster - tvp info ) is available using dvb-t . 
   lol , talking about yourself in 3rd person so `` we '' became 3rd person ? 
  maybe by `` they '' he meant people in the uk because otherwise this statement does n't make sense :d, 
  yeah because being openly racist is worse than being secretely racist like many people in western europe ... 
  we do n't `` expect '' europe to accept our people , we can live in the uk becuase of the eu law . 
  you ca n't compare that to the forced refugees distribution . 
  they will leave poland for germany asap anyway . 
  afaik it was a quite differnt promo - if poland gets to semifinals , every purchase ( between 2 and 5 june ) above 500 pln will be refunded . 
  or windows if you live in krak\u00f3w / zakopane like him :d, 
   poland is yet not lost ( poland ist noch nicht verloren / also german saying ) it 's not a saying , it 's from the first words of our [ national anthem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland_is_not_yet_lost ) . 
  it 's not a big deal , i 've never heard anyone wondering if people from given country are slavic or not . 
  i really do n't know why these questions are the most popular google suggestions . 
  there 's a second one in the southeast area next to a romanian/moldovan region . 
  these cities are on the other end of the country . 
  and that pollution has nothing to do with forests . 
  ok maybe the coal that is the reason of the pollution in poland was made from prehistoric forests :d,
