we do n't have any real ones . 
  the polish sanacja regime before ii world war did something similiar : [ bereza kartuska camp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bereza_kartuska_prison ) yet , at least for most people today have warm feelings about ii polish republic . 
  how is salazar regime remembered in modern portugal ? 
  looking from here it seems that his rule was quite good , especially compared to other dictators of that time . 
  antifas are close to it . 
  yeah , religion of candidate is his most important qualification . 
  and its we who are supposed to be catolic shithole . 
  poland : mainstream media position is from definitely pro eu to slightly eurosceptic . 
  outside of that , there is big segment of self called `` independent '' media ( in reality biggest website , called `` independent '' is owned by political party lol ) which are fanatically anti eu . 
  they arguments are not really economical ones , their agenda seem to me rather similiar to russian `` anti-west '' mentality . 
  [ comments here ] ( http://asset-b.soup.io/asset/0469/5805_b366.gif ), 
  just wait until another time of troubles . 
  oil prices are low already . 
  yeah you are probably right . 
  another thing to consider is distribution of unemployment in countries - in poland countrywide it may be ~ 9 % , but in pozna\u0144 it is below 4 % , and in warmi\u0144sko-mazurskie wojew\u00f3dztwo it is around 20 % . 
  it may be some arbitrary standard , but it actually depends on many outside factors which are different for different countries , no matter what some bureaucrats determined . 
  the banana thing seems strange . 
  i do n't know how would you like to pack your own flour and sugar . 
  straight from the bag ? 
  with beer and milk i see the option , but i think that having [ tanks ] ( http://bet-tech.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/product_btab_photo01_b.jpg ) in the supermarket is n't that good idea . 
  yeah that sounds like home . 
  i just do not see the difference between that and supermarket from this news , besides that you need to bring your own `` container '' . 
  does tipped cashier checks your items faster than flat-waged one ? 
  does tipped bus driver drives you faster ? 
  i do not understand . 
  does n't grocery department of the typical supermarket in the west look like [ that ] ( http://p5.biztok.pl/c5d7c2552191e6d2a24607ee81c94dec.jpg ) ? 
  because they are opposition only in name . 
  they are putin 's satellite parties together with just russia and zhyrinovsky 's party - this one is funny - called liberal democratic party of russia . 
  post war boom , and huge immigration from rural areas , where poles were huge majority changed that number a little bit . 
  the hidden implication that we murdered other 15 % is really not necessary . 
  is n't it everywhere ? 
  not everyone is awake at 6-7 , but everyone is awake at 15-16 . 
  i often run before the sunrise , so for me it makes no difference . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomeranians_ ( slavic_tribe ), 
  it 's extremely easy to get `` sick '' leave . 
  up to 12 years old i guess you are right , but once puberty hits things are starting to change . 
  and it 's biggest problem with the girls . 
  15 year old girl can not be sweaty in public . 
  how is something like [ this ] ( http://www.plywanie.krakow.pl/obrazki/basen-agh/agh-017.jpg ) a luxury ? 
  every swimming pool has it . 
  so sports hall were empty in the morning and crowded in afternoon ? 
  it does n't seem like good management of space . 
  no , we were telling people who did not shower themselves that they are dirty gypsies . 
  high school . 
  well i and my classmates in high school had no problems . 
  in some schools , you ca n't take a shower after physical education class , because they simply are n't there ( or very dirty or damaged ) . 
  i would n't participate in pe if i had to smell like sweat whole day after class . 
  wibor is already at lowest level ever . 
  they are not building it , they are a contract engineer . 
  `` centre '' according to this site . 
  in which capital renting an apartment in centre is cheaper than average income ? 
  mistral deal anyone ? 
  making money by selling weapons to bloody dictatorship ? 
  well you are right . 
  but when we do everything west wants us to do , and in response [ obama cancels missle deal in the day soviets attacked ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/us_missile_defense_complex_in_poland ) we obviously feel betrayed because it already happened 543252315 times in our history . 
  so do n't be surprised when even [ our fm calls your `` support '' worthless ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/22/poland-foreign-minister-alliance-us-worthless ) . 
  yeah , when they want something . 
  they continue to talk only , and act like french . 
  so racism = = implying that there are differences between people ? 
  lol what a bullshit, 
  [ well we have destroyed some symbols of oppression in the past . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_nevsky_cathedral,_warsaw ) i am against destruction of pkin by the way . 
  and not as old - it was rebuild after ww2 . 
  warsaw is no beauty , but calling it ugliest european capital is kinda overstatement . 
  yes , tell me you read all the eula in every piece of software you use . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  not really good choice of products . 
  when people leave country , they stop spending money and market shrinks . 
  it 's common misconception that emigration and immigration are the biggest factors in change of employment . 
  besides : are you people seriously trying to tell me that situation in poland did not improve in that time ? 
  mass emigration started because it became a possibility after joining eu . 
  unemployment decreased from 21 % to 9 % - lowest in history . 
  youth unemployment fall from 42 % to 16 % . 
  and yeah , it was high before - but thats because early 00 's were fucked . 
  well somewhere around 2004-2008 were the best times of poland . 
  of course i would n't attribute that to pis rule . 
  remember that current speaker - kopacz is becoming pm , and former - komorowski is current president . 
  nah we asked for loans months earlier , you gave us monies way too late . 
  not that it would change anything . 
  yet we have low pregnancy rates . 
  they have actually integrated pretty decent at warsaw . 
  and mine was what ? 
  yeah , like americans did anything to help us . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij2kvzpj_bu ) we call it polish detroit . 
  you really think ussr build 22 000 opposed to 4000 german ones just for defence ? 
  if they wanted to defend , they would build defences . 
  instead they manufactured aggresive , fast tanks ( bt series ) designed specificallt for offence . 
  [ it was not that evil fascists they wanted to protect people from . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_military_parade_in_brest-litovsk ), 
  does n't usa have big surplus of shale gas now ? 
  when reagan imposed sanctions at poland in 1981 , current spokesman of communist regime told that `` government will always feed themselves '' . 
  that 's true , sanctions will be either nonexistant or hurting ordinary people , putin 's 70 billion dollars will stay unharmed . 
  most of them are now in military magazines . 
  i would love that out parades look like [ singaporean one . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcwv8avefbc ), 
  soviet union used the same excuse to invade as putin in crimea . 
  they said they need to protect population of western ukraine and western belarus from evil fascist junta . 
  you still have those old panzerfausts in military magazines or it 's new version ? 
  i would love to see bigger presence of us military in poland and baltic countries . 
  it would show commitment to defend us .
