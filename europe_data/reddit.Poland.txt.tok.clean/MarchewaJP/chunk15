   because car ownership here is ridiculously cheap lol wtf . 
  cars cost here almost the same , as in western europe . 
  and significantly more than in us , which make them much more hard to get for our wages . 
  and who the fuck gives company cars for people , who do not have to use them in work ? 
  ( like most people ) . 
  to maintain this lifestyle , you have to earn significantly more than 2 average wages - which pushes you up to [ like 5 % of earners . 
  ] ( http://www.statystyka-zadania.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zarobki-wykres.png ) i know our country made great progress in last 20 years , and we have become more rich than we ever was , but this claims are ridiculous . 
   american healthcare is n't pleasant even for well-off americans at least they do not have to eat [ this shit . 
  middle class have all those , or can afford substiute . 
  and middle class do not use public transport . 
  the poor people do not have those you mentioned . 
  god , all i 'm trying to say that combat experience from donbass is more useful than from iraq . 
  i 'm not trying to deny how tragic all the other wars you are talking about are . 
  i 'm also not trying they were actual wars . 
  this is entirely not the topic of this conversation . 
   no , such a war would have ended in less than a day and billions would have died . 
  there is , and always was a possibility of conventional , limited war , albeit in larger scale than in donbass . 
  hypothetically russia tries to acquire narva . 
  does nato sends nukes first ? 
  nope . 
  does russia send nukes first ? 
  nope . 
  lol at scale . 
  war in donbass is definitely more resembling actual war than afghanistan and iraq . 
  let 's look at death causes . 
   in 2009 , there were 7,228 improvised explosive device ( ied ) attacks in afghanistan , a 120 % increase over 2008 , and a record for the war . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] of the 512 foreign soldiers killed in 2009 , 448 were killed in action . 
  280 of those were killed by ieds . 
  [ 8 ] in 2010 , ied attacks in afghanistan wounded 3,366 u.s. soldiers , which is nearly 60 % of the total ied-wounded since the start of the war . 
  [ 9 ] of the 711 foreign soldiers killed in 2010 , 630 were killed in action . 
  368 of those were killed by ieds , which is around 36 % of the total ied-killed since the start of the war to date . 
  and  ieds were used extensively against us-led invasion forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63 % of coalition deaths in iraq . 
  [ 1 ] they are also used in afghanistan by insurgent groups , and have caused over 66 % of coalition casualties in the 2001 -- present afghanistan war . 
  [ 2 ] this is only ied use . 
  this does not include suicide bombings , friendly fire , and other out of combat deaths . 
  while in donbass there was actual full-fledged war , with heavy artillery use and tank assaults . 
  this resembles hypothetical nato war with russia more than iraq and afghanistan wars . 
  i do not speak about kosovo and bosnia , these were more police operations than war . 
  driving around in armored vehicles and calling air support is hardly any combat experience worth something in `` symmetrical '' war . 
  and here less than 1/3 . 
  the differences are between lowered rates for some product , for example 5 % for books here . 
  [ i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) [ have ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivization_in_the_soviet_union#results ) [ no ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_purge ) [ idea . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag ), 
  [ 14th waffen grenadier division of the ss ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss_ ( 1st_galician \\ ) ) some of them hated the soviets so much , that they allied with nazis . 
   soviet states well , even [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-soviet_states ) disagrees with you . 
   which poland certainly was . 
  yeah . 
   i am not entirely sure why you would take offence at that ... ? 
  i did not , was just correcting wrong information . 
  you can use terms like `` ex-soviet bloc '' or `` ex-warsaw pact '' . 
  we are not ex-soviet . 
  poland was never part of soviet union . 
  well , so how would you call hussite wars ? 
  the point is that catholicism never became something deeply connected to czech identity , like it became in poland or croatia . 
  catholicism in czech republic was always connected to repression and germanisation , that 's why they were so enthusiastic to get rid of it through communism . 
  eh , attributing this only to communism is simplifying the issue . 
  is n't it going as back as 1415 , and burning of jan hus ? 
  from what i learned , catholic church in czech republic acted as oppresive organisation , being supportive of german kings , and later habsburgs . 
  while in poland church was organisation helping preserve polishness from german and russian occupiers - catholicism was something we had in common , opposed to protestant prussians and orthodox russians . 
  so when communists came , czechs were happy to throw the church out of their lives , while poles preserved catholicism through stalinism . 
  eh , mig-29 is 10 years newer construction than f-16 . 
  the problem is that they are not modernized , and use old soviet parts and equipment , while our f-16s use everything new . 
  we 're probaby gon na buy 64 f-35s in 10 years or something like that . 
  nothing official has come from mod yet . 
  it would be extremely expensive though , i hope f-35 cost would be reduced even more . 
  lol , that 's good . 
  yeah , exactly the chaos i was speaking about . 
  i like current logos too , they are done in a similiar style and match the overall design . 
  i would like if the eu agencies went uk 's way . 
  the design is not as consistent as in germany . 
  look at eu parliament , eu commission and eu council logos . 
  different font ( although similiar ) , text placement , size of building . 
  i know i 'm exaggerating here , and talking about this issue as it was something important , but this is one of my pet peeves . 
  especially when looking at some [ retarded logos ] ( http://www.gminaprzemysl.home.pl/dane%20o%20gminie/logo%20gmina%20niebieskie.jpg ) which every village in poland seems to have . 
  nice . 
  although some offices use different logos , the design is consistent and looks good . 
  i still like the system . 
  governments are not companies , they do not care about sales or marketing ( not talking about politicians or parties ) . 
  why ca n't they use eu logo ? 
  i like the german system , where each ministry or agency uses shared logo . 
  it looks like this : [ 1 ] ( http://www.mitbestimmen-in-berlin.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bmfsfj_logo.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.geocat.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bkg_logo.jpg ) it looks nice , is consistent , and do not create chaos like in poland . 
  [ polish source about that . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  you probably pay your soldiers well . 
  if germany attempted to execute seel\u00f6we , soviets would attack . 
  stalin would not repeat france and uk 's mistake . 
  i would definitely not put india here . 
  maybe if they denounced japan ... 
  i do n't know , maybe you are right . 
  so let me rephrase the statement - to win , they would have to find a way to not be in state of war with united states . 
  at 43 % of gdp , according to http://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/poland not that high i think . 
  now we have surplus , and we are growing too . 
  i would just not look only at trade balance , when comparing economies . 
  this is not xviii century mercantilism . 
  trade surplus is n't only valid indicator of strength of economy . 
  poland was growing fastest in 2006-2008 , when we had biggest trade deficit in history . 
  mentality of the society has way bigger impact on the economic prosperity than few percent of difference in taxes . 
  that 's why different policies work differently in many countries . 
  that 's why nordic societies are rich , and southern are in trouble right now . 
  also , that 's why poland has made such a big progress in the last 25 years .
