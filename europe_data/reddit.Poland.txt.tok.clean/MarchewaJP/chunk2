  it 's something we really do n't see from france or germany . 
  the strength of lidl lies not in everyday offer , but in themed weeks . 
  you speak about beer - during british week they had good ipa 's sold at 1/2 - 1/3 their normal cost , and much lower than our domestic ones . 
  i 'm curious about uk point . 
  [ this data ] ( http://www.alpbach.org/alpbuzz/where-the-european-brains-move/ ) really suggest otherwise . 
  you really think people go west to claim benefits ? 
  lol . 
  we do n't need bigger redistribution of wealth , our wealth is really well distributed naturally . 
  we have no oligarchs . 
  instead , we have lower gini coefficient that germany , france or united kingdom . 
  our bigger problem is lack of rich capitalists , owning worldwide companies with headquaters located in poland . 
   but in the world with overproduction of goods and food letting people in developed countries starve is tremendously stupid . 
  it is because your beloved goverments impose customs on imported goods , while giving farmers free money . 
  this way food is not produced in countries where its cheapest to produce , but rather imported or donated from rich western countries . 
  well , i should read more about cyprus issues . 
  i knew about your wars with turkey since 1821 ( and byzantine empire too ) , but had no idea that you felt so threatened by turks while you both were nato members . 
  i guess you convinced me somehow , with turkey as neighbor you guys must feel like us with russia . 
  as i said before , i wish you best luck . 
   the current poland has nothing to do with what these people died for . 
  what do you mean by this ? 
  my hometown is in northern poland , near border with kaliningrad oblast . 
  there is really big increase of people coming to our shops . 
  one day outside of lidl i saw bride and groom with bunch of guys in suits coming to shop from russian bus . 
  i wonder why russian newlyweds in wedding clothes would go shopping . 
  is that some russian custom ? 
  huh , you guys are in the eu from 1981 , why did n't you start developing infrastructure earlier ? 
  ok , you say you did spend eu money well . 
  so from where the over 100 % gdp debt did come from ? 
  i am not german , polish banks did n't really let you money . 
  i have no interest in bleeding greece , i would like to see greek economy rise again . 
  but i think blaming lender that you need to pay off credit is victim blaming . 
  yeah we have that offers in poland too ( of course with 800-1200 pln , pln = 1/4 eur ) , but they exist only to take government money for creating new jobs , employ friend or family member ( because no one sane would work for 200 eur ) , and pay them more under the table . 
  i think your offer is example of similiar actions . 
  anyway , its an offer for beginner-level job , and suggest that 's offer for students or young people living with their parents still . 
  in that case where you do n't have to pay for accomodation i ca n't imagine that 800 eur would n't be enough . 
  we have that shitty advertising-salary-before-tax too . 
  i think also that entry level jobs are not supposed to cover all your expenses including renting apartment and such . 
  using data from that article , we are halfway through 229 bln eur package = = we have not seen half of that money yet . 
  later in this article is written that 115 bln eur is from 2014-2020 budget . 
  no project have been finished under that programs . 
  and i 'm not talking about bailout money - i 'm talking about the billions you borrowed earlier . 
  if you spent it on infrastructure , research or just did n't borrow it your economy would be probably much better . 
  instead you burned the money on pensions or in the pockets of corrupt politicians . 
  maybe i was a little aggresive in previous paragraphs , but i really wish you the best . 
  yeah , you have a shitty job ( that `` volunteering '' thing , that hour in the middle ) and live away from work . 
  i just do n't know why are you trying to dump that shit on government while its just your personal experience . 
  ruined ? 
  if you mean closing factories producing utter shit , existing only to get money from government is ruining the economy than i wish everyone would ruin economies so much . 
  besides , even looking at economic [ data ] http://static.pb.pl/picture/93505,90071/660 ) ( yellow - poland , grey - central and eastern europe , blue - eu , green - hungary , gdp by ppp change ) the `` ruin '' is nearly nonexistant compared to countries which did not do this `` shock '' therapy . 
  where did you get this ridiculous number from ? 
  400 bln is half of eu budget for 2007-2013 . 
  official [ ministry of development data ] ( http://www.mir.gov.pl/english/news/strony/10years_of_polands_membershipinthe_eu_10years_withthe_europeanfunds.aspx ) estimate it around 82 bln eur , not net . 
  also guys , if you four countries got that much money and still have that shitty economies you should consider that maybe you are doing something wrong . 
  yeah , 40 hour working week means never having free time . 
  every `` lost '' war us lost on home front , while winning militarily . 
  maybe ideals , which europe represents - democracy , freedom , self-determination ... 
  well , you sound like he did n't care about them , just used them in politics . 
  austrians did similar thing to our nobles in [ 1846 ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/galician_slaughter ), 
  it 's not like anyone anywhere at that time cared for peasants . 
  i 'm not a orban fan , but comparing him to putin is the same level of exaggeration as comparing putin to stalin . 
  when he was at school only russian was seen as worthy . 
  maybe german , since after war fear of germans was still big . 
  who the fuck sees parts of ukraine and belarus as poland besides ultranationalists with 0,1 % support ? 
  the problem is russia thinking eastern ukraine is russia , not poland . 
  lol . 
  putin fans = berlusconi fans ? 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  but despite great effort from the opposing parties to sell the tapes as showing corruption , they have not . 
  why do you ask ? 
  it 's really hard to say . 
  if we are talking about economy , every good example could be confronted with a counterexaple . 
  example : government agency is very good about spending money on roads . 
  we have about 30 00 km highways now , compared to 900 in 2007 . 
  on the other hand , railways are managed incredible shitty , so new roads are congested year or two after their completion because trains are not alternative to them . 
  i guess the best thing i can say about them is that they are not corrupt , which was proven in the last tapping scandal . 
  we are building lng terminal which could alone cover half of our gas needs . 
  please do that . 
  this is the best way you could help us , and make money of course . 
  not right now , but in a perspective of 30-50 years yes . 
  you do realize that soviet army equals at most one allied/german corps ? 
  you 're not missing the point , but this example is exaggeration . 
  it 's not like you helped eastern europe with anything . 
  if anyone 's winning in this conflict , it 's belarus . 
  they are playing every possible side - vocally supporting russia , selling them banned goods , and acting like a peacemaker . 
  nope . 
  they are not genocidal . 
  instead they think in terms of [ concert of europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concert_of_europe ) - dealing with spheres of influence , resolving matters of small countries between big powers . 
  example of that is recent talks between french , german , russian and ukrainian mofas . 
  what the fuck ? 
  they use maybe 0,00001 % of our energy production , and it 's already in best interest of the manufacturers to make them as efficient as possible . 
  yeah , world with third reich and no jews would be much better one . 
  and mrls smerch with 300mm rockets is ideal for the job . 
  russians are definitely not . 
  russian government on the other hand resembles all the worst 19th century regimes . 
  [ how horrible , fantastic , incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing . 
  ] ( http://img.audiovis.nac.gov.pl/pic/pic_1-m-268-3.jpg ) have we learnt nothing ? 
  [ commonwealth of three nations ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian%e2%80%93ruthenian_commonwealth ), 
  i was speaking about political alternative . 
  spd with steinmeier would appease russia even more . 
  1619 best borders .
