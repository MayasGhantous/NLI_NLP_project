  maybe go full option with b-2 , right ? 
  it 's not that simple .

  pepper sprays are not against planned ambushes . 
  same as alarms and reinforced doors wo n't do much vs crime professionals . 
  they exist to counter random , accidental encounters . 
  pepper spray is very effective against drunk idiots or random refugees with blue balls . 
  self-defence training of course is good idea . 
  ambush means that do n't have the time to use anything . 
  at least if you 're not walking with your gun in hand . 
  gun , knife , anything other than awareness does n't do anything vs an ambush . 
  exactly , wtf . 
  mostly because people who wan na party all the time are doing it ? 
  yeah , crime polish gangs , squatting at my neighborhood . 
  your life must be terrible . 
  so it 's better to take immigrants who wo n't work a honest day in a lifetime and leach off welfare ? 
  we are being taught that hard work is the key . 
  maybe it 's not true in germany nowadays . 
  they burned like one tvn car three years ago . 
  there are thousands burned every year in france . 
  working is the key . 
  we are not leeches . 
  even 5 or 10 % percent like in france can cause mass burnings or riots . 
  there are no riots in poland , and i like it that way . 
  since when parsi people are arabs ? 
  well , no skyscrapers in swiss plan for example . 
  you posted two different plans man , none of which is what i posted . 
  this is funny , because this plans are from 2015 . 
  and from switzerland , too . 
  i do love european cities without skyscrapers , like those you have mentioned , or prague for example . 
  i like skyscrapers in warsaw though , they add real value to the chaos of the city . 
  they should be more contained though , highrises over 100 meters should be clustered near dworzec centralny and close wola - near rondo daszy\u0144skiego . 
  also , the biggest cancer in warszawa 's living tissue , osiedle za \u017belazn\u0105 bram\u0105 should be destroyed . 
  first photo is more than 5 years old . 
  there is no kdt on pl . 
  defilad now . 
  also , plac defilad is kinda special autistic child of communist city policies . 
  due to awful legal situation of that terrain ( dekret bieruta ) , it 's practically impossible to build something there . 
  situation is improving though , legal status of some properties have been established and there are `` real '' plans of fixing the situation there . 
  so your version of fun is [ this ] ( http://www.fotopolis.pl/media/obrazki/dabrowska_bloki2.jpg ) ? 
  this is more sad than any grey ones . 
  you know , the problem is that there are really good modernisations . 
  like those : [ 1 ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1616535/sosnowiec%20sm%20pd/img_2525r.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1616535/sosnowiec%20sm%20pd/img_2522r.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1616535/remonty/img_2161.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1616535/remonty/img_2179.jpg ) [ 5 ] ( http://d-pt.ppstatic.pl/k/r/1/fb/77/55b0b1b389c35_p.jpg?1437649033 ) the problematic ones are the ones which look like somebody threw up on the plan . 
  and you know , we had those 3rd world looking ones here too . 
  oh , man , you have n't seen the best !, 
  just no . 
  noooo , muh traditions !, 
  making jail time so artificially low shows you 're not valuing life properly . 
  wait , where do you get your data from ? 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita ) tells me that we are doing at least decent . 
  wtf ? 
  5 years for murder ? 
  this is literally endorsing crime . 
  the percentage of `` eastern europeans '' working and not claiming benefits in your country is higher than native citizens . 
   as long as your gdp growth * tax rate is greater than your deficit * interest , the situation is improving . 
  as greece has shown , you ca n't expect interest to stay low in the long term . 
  i am perfectly okay with those reforms . 
  they adress issues i have a problem with , like benefit migration or nearly nonexistent digital common market . 
  i also want the uk to stay in eu , because i feel the need to have a strong voice balancing german and french ideas of expanding eu power , only in the directions they are comfortable with . 
  you have permament deployment . 
  baltic air policing , while rotating , is permament . 
  the same agreement was `` breached '' in poland . 
  though russia broke it first , invading ukraine . 
  germany has unsustainably small military , to the point it 's unable to perform basic operation . 
  look at luftwaffe 's combat readiness . 
  tbh many claimed . 
  we do reject them though . 
  western ukraine is perfectly safe for refugees . 
  we welcome people who want to work , not claim benefits . 
  you do not feed your children bacon all day ? 
  what a filthy islamic terrorist . 
  and the great thread on polish skyscraperscity forums : [ 100 years of urban design in poland ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1660101 ), 
  you know what 's the most basic thing about constitution ? 
  it can be changed . 
  surpluses on pensions ? 
  lol we already have to subsidy pensions from budget so much . 
  and there is really none to stand for the other 76 % ? 
  that 's not how google works . 
  sex-companies ? 
  you mean pimping/running a brothel is legal like in germany ? 
  huh , that 's the opposite of prostitution being illegal i suppose . 
  here prostitution is legal , but claiming profits from someone other 's prostitution is n't . 
  i guess that 's the decent compromise . 
  is prostitution illegal in the netherlands ? 
   from what i know the political regime that signed the treaty would either have to consider its stipulations automatic defacto law , and any internal contradiction , including constitutional , void until amended to line up to the agreement . 
  `` the constitutional tribunal of poland ruled that while eu law may override national statutes , it does not override the constitution . 
  in cases of a conflict between eu law and the constitution , poland can make a sovereign decision as to how this conflict should be resolved ( i.e. 
  by changing the constitution , leaving the eu or seeking to change the eu law ) . '', 
   edit : and again , forgot to mention something relevant . 
  in most democracies international treaties are voted on in either one or both of its houses of government before being signed . 
  we have the institution of `` small '' ratification , where law has to be signed only by president , albeit not really relevant to this case . 
  we are speaking about two different things here . 
  of course , if you sign said deal and does n't implement it , there would be some consequences , ranging from `` expressing worries '' and `` strong letters of condemnation '' to embargoes and possibly war . 
  i 'm talking about how our internal structure of law would react to said deal . 
  the first comment is true . 
  the second comment is deep fearmongering . 
   international deals supersede local laws , including the constitution no fucking way . 
  great comment , thank you . 
  i was very positive about germany . 
  now i have similar attitude to germany and russia : i like both germans and russians , but i hate their governments .
