  do you really think ace investigative journalism shapes the public opinion ? 
  it 's always tabloids . 
  kukiz is strange , they both have very pro free market politicians as jacek wilk , and national socialists like robert winnicki . 
  do you account changes in exchange rate ? 
  dollar in poland is two times more expensive than in 2008 . 
  [ at his finest ] ( http://r-scale-fa.dcs.redcdn.pl/scale/o2/tvn/web-content/m/p1/i/c88d8d0a6097754525e02c2246d8d27f/cec7391b-6101-46d3-a85d-d3d0c12b7122.png?type=1&amp;srcmode=4&amp;srcx=0/1&amp;srcy=0/1&amp;srcw=640&amp;srch=2000&amp;dstw=640&amp;dsth=2000&amp;quality=80 ), 
  you can make other refugees collect those items for a few percent of what they manage to get . 
  at least that is what you germans did at your concentration camps with jews and poles . 
  remember that next time when germans start jabber about `` eu solidarity '' . 
  you do n't buy tanks or carriers with ppp . 
  the fact that you believe in varoufakis lies does n't mean you have any knowledge . 
  you have the impudence to say shit like that with a greek flair . 
  they are cutting faster with surplus though . 
  surplus means no new loans are taken , only rolling old ones . 
  combined with gdp increase , that makes debt smaller in comparison to gdp . 
  good . 
  less debt is always good . 
  nuclear plants closing is such a stupid and backwards move . 
  on poland schools were closed only when it went to -35 . 
  -15 is something you can expect at the winter . 
  it 's fucking cold though . 
  if both szyd\u0142o and kopacz do n't make you biased against woman in politics that means you are quite resilient . 
  russian government and politicians , not explicitly russia or russians . 
  it 's better to tax fuel than for example income . 
  it incentives use of public transportation . 
  15 grams of marijuana would be treated as 1500 portions by polish police . 
  useful when driving home drunk . 
  if you do n't have benefits , working threatens nothing . 
  poland wins again . 
  we had higher % of growth , yes , but you skewed that number much . 
  that growth was unsustainable without access to eu market . 
  in per capita numbers , we 're far from first place . 
  really ? 
  that sounds like you visited dworzec centralny at least 5 years ago . 
  ... who did n't ? 
  well , it 's russia which fucked up situation at chechnya , and still occupies that country . 
  i prefer gray , well maintained blocks than this pastel shit .

  i wish more people here thought so . 
  ah , so it 's just different name for prime minister . 
  thanks . 
  ah , so it 's just different name for prime minister . 
  thanks . 
   president wait , is n't spain a kingdom ? 
  and what happens when you present the law and pass it in the same day , including upper house vote and president signature ? 
  because that 's what happened here . 
  elvish in the witcher . 
  well , you assume someone actually did . 
  no way man , it 's supposed to be half-assed done 10 minutes before lesson , not after !, 
   afsluitdijk i 'm sure you just randomly bashed the keyboard . 
  yes , for films and series there is nothing yet . 
  i 'm sure something will come up . 
  producers lose bilions from lack of sensible offer . 
  well , spotify and yt ** did ** make torrenting obsolete for me , and millions of other users . 
  you mean armed ones , capable of firing/shootineg missles ? 
  well that would be certainly illegal . 
  we ca n't sue a law . 
  that concept does n't exist here . 
  ok , we found the best measurement of evil : who killed most jews . 
  definitely worse to kill thousands of jews than tens of millions of russians , belorussians , ukrainians , poles , and hundreds of other nations opressed by soviet union . 
   final point leninism and stalinism are n't really in the same league either . 
  stalinism is the one you might want to criticize , lenin did n't do anything evil . 
  yeah , cheka was just happy fun loving organization , and war communism was a totally fair economic system , and it 's totally not true that millions of people died because of it . 
  100 % agree . 
  immigrants issue is more important than sanctions on russia , which economy is collapsing either way . 
  also , it was germany and france who sidetracked us from ukraine talks . 
  this is their mess now . 
   1 ) what about transportation vehicles ? 
  trucks clogging all european rings around cities have also a huge responsabilit\u00e9 . 
  no trucks =  non traffic jams =  less fuel burned . 
  i think we moved past the toxic american mentality that everybody needs to own a car . 
  we are doing it in my family . 
  the blessing by priest part is true though . 
  so refugees ca n't work ? 
  what about luxembourg ? 
  700k + people from ukraine in poland in 2015 . 
  they are working though . 
  i was hoping for baghdadi to top the list . 
  oh i know , us system is really problematic . 
  it took me few years of frequenting reddit and rest of english internet to somewhat understand the system . 
  german one seems more crazy - it looks like in the young age ( 12 years old ? ), 
  it is decided if you can go to the university in the future . 
  well , the simplified perception of bologna process in poland is that you can do bachelors in something , and then do a masters in something entirely different , with few exceptions ( law , medicine , probably something else too ) . 
   for example , i considered going back for a master 's degree , but could n't study what i wanted because i did n't have the correct bachelor degree , even though i have worked many years in a related industry . 
  does n't bologna system fix this ? 
  you know , there is no significant change of emissions is eu and us when the chinese emissions skyrocketed . 
  it was a fucking joke . 
  you can buy oil from anywhere . 
  ever heard about tankers ? 
  isis sells oil really cheap now . 
  you really believe there was no war in europe because there was some stupid steel treaty ? 
  this is some stupid eu founding myth . 
  there was no war , because there was real enemy - ussr , and ways to wipe whole country from the face of the earth . 
  russia exports practically only gas and oil . 
  you can buy gas/oil everywhere , and it 's much cheaper than year or two ago . 
  this figures are from 2014 - look at prices of oil year ago and now , and tell me that volume will be higher now . 
  nuclear weapons ? 
  [ this is myth , russia is even less important trade partner for germany than czech republic .
