  you have hydro , solar and wind . 
  they are not as feasible here . 
   as it is now if one party would say `` we will close the mines '' other would say `` we will keep them open '' and get all those votes . 
  current government won the elections on that promise to keep them open . 
  then closes them . 
  well , us had `` department of war '' up until 1947 , and uk had `` war office '' up to 1964 . 
  good tsar , bad boyars mentality at full force . 
  pokemon trainers . 
  did industrial revolution bring `` new '' jobs ? 
  people mined iron and coal before , people made clothes before , people made glass , paper et cetera hundreds years before . 
  the actual difference was that less people were needed to make these - not more . 
  only new jobs were directly connected to servicing and creating the machines that driven the revolution , namely steam engines and their applications - which were actually not many people . 
  the same happened later with electricity , petroleum , and lately computers . 
  they are considered `` services '' . 
  the economy progresses only if jobs are eliminated . 
  yet people work the same amount of time . 
   you missed the services available part . 
  we have vastly more choice in our food , and the food is selected much more strictly . 
  it 's not just a matter of someone eating x amount more , it 's a matter of us producing x amount more per person . 
  while having y more people . 
  where y and x together make up the difference . 
  though of course there was also a shift in who worked where . 
  in no circumstance those changes can compensate for needing 80x less worktime for same amount of goods . 
   and what is that new industry ? 
  where are the millions of new jobs actually coming from ? 
  mostly services . 
  there are working somewhere , since there are no big differences in employment rate - there are at least a magnitude smaller than differences in agriculture employment rate . 
  i do n't want that on a german paranoidal level , but yeah , sometimes it is handy . 
  yeah , nobody cares what happens on eu levels . 
   ( which is what we did , expanding our population and the services available per person ) okay , this is bullshit - average person does n't need 80 times more food than 100 years ago - maybe 1,5 times more . 
  we did n't expand food production per capita 80 times - nobody would need that food , and since food production is in private hands , nobody would produce that much . 
  we increased food production to maintain population increase and have margin , yet in no way employment in food production is being maintained . 
  it is a shadow what it was . 
  [ france ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.agr.empl.zs?locations=fr ) , [ germany ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.agr.empl.zs?locations=de ) , [ poland ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.agr.empl.zs?locations=pl ) - everything proves that you are wrong . 
   this is what people do n't get when they compare where we are now to the industrial revolution . 
  people in industrial revolution started being employed in a completely different industry - mass production and services - and that 's what 's going to happen now , albeit on a different scale . 
  what 's the difference between going from 80 ppl to 1 doing the job and 80 ppl to 0 ? 
  if they go abroad how would you make them pay ? 
  it seems to me that this would only drive people away . 
  only thing that would work is forbidding citizens to leave the country . 
  not the best solution . 
  or having german wages ... 
  this is too drastic . 
  they have already been there and survived . 
  we can help them secure their border , not commit mutual suicide . 
  high population means more consumption , which means more people to service this needs . 
  it 's not like everyone is getting new uniform now . 
  it will probably be gradual . 
  first link from google tells me that [ poles are for nuclear energy ] ( http://innpoland.pl/114415,sondaz-58-proc-polakow-popiera-budowe-elektrowni-atomowej ) . 
  the reason nuclear has n't gotten very far is : * when the time was best for nuclear energy - 70s , early 80s - communists - gierek etc - loved coal * when they finally understood that coal is n't everything chernobyl and freedom happened * then we had absolutely no money for such costly investments * when we finally could afford nuclear power plant po stalled * now pis will probably trash whole idea . 
  i do n't think we are somehow more fearful than anyone else . 
  we 're not germans . 
  i was talking about west . 
  yeah , there 's a lot to fix about africa . 
  they have to start though . 
  cheap energy . 
  pv , solar , maybe even nuclear fusion lel . 
  that 's a fight we can not win . 
  there are deeper problems with africa . 
  and until they solve theirs technology might solve some problems here . 
  less than using them as slaves imo . 
  yeah , i fail to see what 's wrong with that . 
  well , kids can fuck . 
  what 's wrong with that . 
   this is issue with this kind of practice , it 's easy for companies to jump from country to country . 
  we are running from shitty countries though . 
  [ china ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/china-wages.png?s=chinawag&amp;v=201606141716n&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231 ) , [ india ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/vietnam-wages.png?s=vietnamwag&amp;v=201608101914n&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231 ) and vietnam are n't so shitty anymore , korea , japan and taiwan are first world now . 
  you have only myanmar , bangladesh et cetera now . 
  why do you connect age of consent and being a kid . 
  it would apply to crimea if citizens got actual chance to express their opinion , without russian boot . 
  and unlike uk , i do n't think 50 % +1 is enough majority to decide things that are that serious . 
  maybe 2/3 or 3/4 . 
  we are very divided , but people actually believe in what they believe . 
  i think this happens with every languages - at least it happens with polish . 
  awesome for software developers ? 
  where do you work ? 
  intel ? 
   jan hus had something going on . 
  flames ? 
  dorm which i was living in looked similiarily . 
  good times . 
  jesus fuck , this is school ? 
  it looks like some tech company hq . 
  that 's what i would like avoid . 
  yeah , barn is great . 
  though i recommend [ this ranking ] ( http://burgerblog.pl/ranking-burgerowni/ ) if you wish to find some at least equally good , lesser known place . 
  they told me it will clog . 
  maybe they are plumbers . 
  ok , i had a different experience 6 years ago . 
  and great northern war , which is often overlooked , and had the same devastating effect . 
  maybe my impression was wrong . 
  bad plumbing i guess . 
  that 's what i encountered . 
  i do n't know any plumber . 
  i guess we have good enough plumbing that we do n't need a lot of them . 
  and we can flush toilet paper , suck it lithuania , belarus , ukraine . 
  i quite love the irony there : headquarters of communist party are headquarters of warsaw stock exchange . 
  it 's not like decent buildings are destroyed to make those skyscrapers . 
  usually old commie office buildings or empty lots . 
  that does not only apply to skyscrapers .
