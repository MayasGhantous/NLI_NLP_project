  and we could n't just stop development of newer building . 
  people had no sense of architecture after 45 years of commie blocks , just look at [ that 820 page topic ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1660101 ) on skyscrapercity featuring superior polish urban planning and design . 
  so , i do believe that warsaw turned out quite well . 
  so maybe vienna ? 
  that happy man 's face . 
  you 're right . 
  well , our notes feature most notable kings . 
  there are not many other good choices here . 
  prague ? 
  looks cool !, 
   $ 50 that 's actually harsher than in poland , we have to pay like 100 pln . 
  and there is `` attempt '' of drinking in public - basically having an open beer in public - worth 50 pln . 
  in most places , yes . 
  sometimes there is `` unofficial '' permission from the police - for example , it 's safe to drink at praga side of vistula in warsaw . 
  jan iii sobieski , victor from vienna . 
  they [ invaded us first ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war ) . 
  you could ask czechs and slovaks why they [ invaded us back in 1919 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war ) . 
  we are forbidden to drink alcohol `` on streets , parks and squares '' . 
  it looks great imo . 
  i really like look of our notes , they are really much better looking than euro . 
   the things is whole city should be planned and zoned , not only certain districts . 
  people do n't always live in the same district . 
  yes , of course , although i do n't know what your second sentence really means in this context . 
  the problems are low coverage - it 's not an easy task to plan whole country at once , and nimbyism . 
  too strict planning encourage nimbyism - just look at san francisco where developers ca n't build dense apartments to meet the demand of affordable housing , driving nimby 's old houses value to the roof . 
   is that your opinion or do you have some research to back it up ? 
  because from what i 've heard it 's not really that way but perhaps i 'm wrong . 
  one of the defining principles of [ new urbanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_urbanism ) ( warning - us centric article ) , the dominant - and only true , i am a believer - urbanism philosophy is to create areas that are easily walkable and designed to maximized access to public transport . 
  and the biggest factor increasing affordability and availability of public transport is population density . 
  suburbanism , what you propose , lead to what is considered a worst nightmare from new urbanism point of view - us type suburban design . 
  la defense is of course different from never-ending sea of shitty cardboard houses , but since it 's creation represented the same modernist principle of promoting individual transport , separation of traffic and similiar discredited ideas . 
  commie blocks are even different philosophy , result of schizophrenia of urban designers and decision makers of that time . 
  communist modernism promoted shared housing ( very rightly so ) , but also individual transport - strange combination , leading to not really dense , unwalkable communities . 
  since economy of communist countries was horribly inefficient , plans of increasing individual transport share could n't really work due to lack of cars . 
  so public transport had to be supported . 
  that was great actually , because unlike us we at least have some working tram networks , `` suburbs '' that communicate with city by rail , like pruszk\u00f3w or wo\u0142omin near warsaw , or wejherowo and tczew near tr\u00f3jmiasto . 
  if you wish to expand your knowledge in areas of urban design and public transport , please visit [skyscraperscity.com ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/ ) . 
  it has big [ polish section ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/forumdisplay.php?f=45 ) ( with a decent economy/political section , but you 'll have to login to see it ) , people mostly represent new urbanism point of view , so if you really believe in discredited modernist ideas you 'll have a hard time there . 
  we do have your supreme zoning ideas implemented in s\u0142u\u017cewiec . 
  it 's horrible nightmare from urbanist standpoint . 
  economic and business center of the city should be in center , to ease life of working people of the city . 
  and most cities know that , and even `` newer '' business zones like canary wharf in london are close to the center . 
  or , you know , `` close wola '' in warsaw . 
  close to center , connected to the metro lines . 
  errors of s\u0142u\u017cewiec corrected - not only `` towers '' , but also apartments like 19 dzielnica . 
  i 'm kinda the same as the previous guy - hate pis , but do n't interfere . 
  it 's not that they are polish - they are 100 % lawfully elected by poles . 
  it 's called democracy and i kinda prefer that we can sometimes elect a government that does stupid shit , than having no rights at all . 
  when you 're lawfully convinced , you ca n't be a candidate in polish elections . 
  that 's in our constitution . 
  i think it 's great idea . 
  then basil happened . 
  looks like something wehrmacht would fly . 
  thank you for voice of reason . 
  it 's not `` paramilitary militia '' , it 's ment to be like us national guard or uk army reserve . 
  what the fuck with that shitty journalism , that 's not what i expected from bbc . 
  they rebuild all lidls in poland like two years ago to add a bakery . 
  before this system , we had meetings between parents and teachers in school where they learned everything . 
  does schools in serbia not do this ? 
  4 to 10 in warsaw . 
  from 7 pln they start to be edible . 
  overall homicides rates are more relevant - where guns are legal , there will be more homicides by guns ( and less by knives for example ) . 
  that does n't mean that more guns cause more deaths - it 's better to have less overall homicide rate with bigger gun homicide rate . 
  less people die . 
  we are as allowed to have guns as we are allowed to have cars . 
  here , watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug3vydaciuy ) . 
  the tunnel will be used for dozens , maybe hundreds of years . 
  if he wants , than yes . 
  in the model of liquid democracy , he would be able to recognize that other person might have better chances at recognizing better solution and give the vote to him . 
  what is more important , he would be able to revoke this - something that is entirely impossible in indirect democracies , and which creates horrible circus of hypocrisy and dishonesty like modern election process . 
  like every eurolager ever ? 
  even calling it `` wine '' seems like an understatement . 
  or katowice and whole upper silesia, 
  both were capitals of a different culture before . 
  tenochtitlan and constantinople . 
  also , nimbyism . 
  [ so cool ] ( https://youtu.be/2wl0ddop5bo ), 
  they are power plants that produce heat . 
  it 's infinitely better than if all the commie blocks had to burn coal in less efficient ways to generate heat . 
  care to explain what differences are between germany and united kingdom , that despite there are 5x more legal guns in germany homicide rates by guns are nearly the same ? 
   but as i said , i 'd like to get rid of the visas all together for pl , ro , and bg . 
  there still be different kinds of visas , for example j1 or h1b , which i 'll probably try to get . 
   i was only pointing out people trying to take the high ground based on `` equality '' and `` fairness '' do n't actually believe these things . 
  they are just saying they believe in them to make one argument , and for some , to demonize the us . 
  sure , there is bullshit everywhere . 
  there are 30x more legal guns per capita in germany than in poland . 
  yet , there is no real noticeable difference in homicides per capita [ 1 ] . 
  this alone shows that problems with guns are more related to illegal weapons , general state of crime and mentality of citizens . 
  also , this shows why using united states as an example when talking about gun laws makes little to none sense . 
  all of the above factors are wildly different there . 
  that 's why it 's better to look at countries that have similiar culture and mentality - with only real difference in this aspect is number of guns per capita . 
  and after looking at european countries that have much more guns , like sweden , norway , switzerland , france or germany i simply find no reasons to believe that gun ownership is sole factor responsible for high crime and homicides rate . 
  [ 1 ] - interestingly , there is difference of suicides - guns are simply the easiest way out . 
  poles have been migrating to us since xix century . 
  i 'm pretty sure that poles you 're hearing are either legal migrants , or illegal migrants who are already 15 + years in us . 
  and , obviously , if we had visa waiver 15 years ago , millions of poles would try to illegally immigrate to us . 
  since then , we have entered eu . 
  those people who would illegally immigrate to us are now in uk , ireland or germany . 
  we can work without problems in many well developed countries with much higher wages than in poland . 
  those countries are much closer to poland too .
