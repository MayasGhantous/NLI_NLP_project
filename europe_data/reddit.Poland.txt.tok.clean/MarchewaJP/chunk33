  this enormously lowers the amount of people who would try to illegally immigrate to us - there are better options anyway . 
   that said , even illegal polish immigrants tend to just want to work . 
  they do n't tend to get involved with crime or anything . 
  quite frankly i 'd rather greater scrutiny be applied to people from western european countries who 's citizens continue to spontaneously explode and allow pl , ro , and bg into the program . 
  bureaucracies are slow but hopefully it changes sooner rather than later . 
  i 'd rather like at least to humanize the process of getting visa . 
  it 's not a topic for us citizens - since they obviously never need to get a visa for their own country - but us bureaucracy is horrendous . 
   what i do n't like is the hypocrisy of the eu claiming it 's complaints are based on `` fairness '' . 
  ro and bg have met the requirements for schengen for about 5 years . 
  yet every time they apply they are rejected . 
  hard to take an entity seriously when it claims to want outside countries to treat it 's citizens `` equally '' when it doesnt even do so itself . 
  this is evident in more than schengen . 
  concerns of german or french politicians seem to hold far more sway than those of poland or romania , even if they are representing the same amount of people . 
  i wholeheartedly agree . 
  there is no valid reason for keeping them out . 
  no , i believe he is talking about complete centralism , with puppet states existing only for administrative tasks and legitimacing central `` commission '' ( who the fuck invented that name ? 
  there are only negative connotations i can think of . 
  that 's what you believe , and something that is just not confirmed by the data . 
  it has n't stopped thousands of people from other countries , sometimes with two digits overstaying rate . 
  well , they certainly try to keep us out , due to unfounded claim that millions of poles will rush to us borders the minute they waive the visas . 
  yeah , looking at older gdp comparisons italy was country with one of the strongest economies in the eu . 
  hardly imaginable today . 
  he 's not comparing current eu , but direction he thinks juncker is going . 
  are n't skinheads and dresy totally different `` subcultures '' ? 
  yeah , right . 
  or metalheads, 
  yeah , i guess nutrition plays big role , but it 's new generation eating really healthy or last generation eating very shitty ? 
  i mean i do n't see that effect in poland and we 've been through communism and shit . 
  sudden size increase ? 
  what happened ? 
  that 's not true . 
  [ this report ] ( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fy%2015%20dhs%20entry%20and%20exit%20overstay%20report.pdf ) suggests that poland 's overstaying rate is lower than many countries on vwp , such as italy , hungary , chile or portugal . 
   in the end , visa free travel is a privilege and not a human right of course , us can refuse visa free travel to whatever country they want to . 
  i just want them to admit that we are not denied because of our own actions , but because they simply do n't want us . 
  [ rados\u0142aw sikorski 's words ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27973473 ) remain true . 
  because you can freely adjust the stats as you like . 
  they can equivalently say they are offering visa waiver to countries they like . 
  i see [ this ] ( http://cdn29.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/477027/lech-walesa-papiez-pilsudski.jpg ), 
  us is the sole authority which refuses or grants visas . 
  using refusal rate - something entirely depending on themselves as metric is stupid as shit . 
  overstaying rate or something like that would be proper measures . 
  that 's more understandable when you look at [ unemployment stats ] ( http://www.michalstopka.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/bezrobocie2.gif ) . 
  there is no double standard , he would be equally critical about `` real '' christians as he is about real muslims . 
  his argument has flaws , but this is not one of them . 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  you ca n't get fired as a teacher ? 
  no , they sold publishing business years ago . 
  they are only cdpr and gog.com now . 
  overall economy yes , stock market no . 
  although not big . 
  it 's first in line to be in wig20 , so not that miniscule . 
  20 celsius here in warsaw today . 
  people still wear jackets though, 
  20 celsius here in poland today . 
  yes . 
  you posted trolleybuses actually . 
  it 's good vs helis and costs much less than rockets . 
  this type of air defence still has it 's place in modern armies . 
  cheating is not about sexuality , it 's about not being a disgusting fuck . 
  no port arthur ? 
  triggered by the lack of warm water ports . 
  \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is only big city in poland that is systematically depopulating - from 880 thousand people 25 years ago to less than 700 thousand now . 
  nah , warsaw is like bigos - everything fits . 
  vienna is already more dense that most `` socialist '' cities . 
  not sure what you want to have , 17 story towers ( like the one i live in ) combined with 5x as many grass terrain for shitting for dogs around them instead of nice dense tenement houses ? 
  also , your rent is only 60 % bigger than mine despite 200 % difference in gdp : < i 'd take decent urbanism instead of `` creative process '' of [ randomly placing buildings around ] ( http://ursynow.org.pl/galeriaprojektow/1975_ursynowpolnocnylo.jpg ) . 
  you already have flats . 
  why do you think it 's something different ? 
  lol . 
  warsaw city hall employs over 22 thousand people . 
  that 's russian meme . 
  you got me , i used `` lager '' as an synonym to a typical international pale tasteless lager or pils . 
  there are some amazing lager beers - as an low temperature fermentation styles - such as baltic porters . 
  that being said , there 's nothing more boring in beer than german low fermentation beers . 
  their most interesting styles are ales - berliner weisse , gose and standard hefeweizen . 
  even kolsch . 
  but lagers ? 
  bock , helles , marzen ... that 's boring . 
  even their pilses are more boring than czech ones , and that 's an achievement . 
   whoever says a lager is disgusting is not a craft beer snob , it 's just an idiot . 
  it 's not disgusting at all , it 's just boring . 
  i have no time to drink boring beers when i can drink amazing beers . 
  apa is lower gravity variant of american ipa . 
   two speed europe i hope you realize that the part with euro will be slower one in this configuration . 
  and chelyabinsk . 
  where does enforcing speed limits need mass surveillance ? 
  you put policemen near road with radar and they give tickets to people . 
  no people needed to search garbage or some shit . 
   if the `` solution '' promotes pathological behavior like couples intentionally not living together to squeeze money from state something is really wrong . 
  this is fucking clue . 
  [ 12 km ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/dir/sergels+torg/rinkeby,+stockholm,+sweden/@59.360627,17.9617516,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0x47973eea6a251a0f!2m2!1d18.0645449!2d59.3323565!1m5!1m1!1s0x465f9e5ec8daecd5:0x7665163b45fb5b2f!2m2!1d17.9278536!2d59.388791!3e1 ) is not that far away . 
  as long as it 's not sergels torg it 's not stockholm , right ? 
  maybe some rules are worth reconsidering if they require mass surveillance to work ? 
  promoting being alone in a first place seems not really bright , let alone strictly enforcing this . 
  if the `` solution '' promotes pathological behavior like couples intentionally not living together to squeeze money from state something is really wrong . 
  the fuck . 
  you really have people dedicated to literally spying on ordinary citizens ? 
  why ? 
  it has many benefits . 
  induction   gas .
