  then how do you explain [ oz\u017bb ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/osiedle_za_%c5%bbelazn%c4%85_bram%c4%85 ) , the worst cancer on live tissue of a city that warsaw has ever endured ? 
  stalinist years were not that bad - \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie po\u0142udniowe is definitely the coolest area in warsaw right now , and it was rebuild in those years . 
  look up mdm . 
  after 50s some of the worst ideas started to pop . 
  [ this ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/osiedle_za_%c5%bbelazn%c4%85_bram%c4%85 ) cancer still exists in \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie and wola . 
  [ this photo ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/0/14936/m14936670,klm-9109a.jpg ) is way better . 
  ] ( http://www.transport-publiczny.pl/wiadomosci/warszawa-miastem-transportu-publicznego-49642.html ) 57 % of people use public transportation , 18 % walk , and 3 % use bikes , and it 's only city where public transportation result is over 50 % . 
  obviously i agree with your sentiment though . 
  things are done to improve situation - there are big investments in public transportation such as second line of metro , or new big tram line in southern warsaw . 
  the southern bypass is also under construction , which will push transit out of the city . 
  looking at smaller changes - wide streets at the center of the city are starting to be narrowed . 
  one good example is \u015awi\u0119tokrzyska street - during metro construction two years ago it was narrowed . 
  there are projects to narrow and build more street-level passes on aleje jerozolimskie - probably most important street in warsaw . 
  we 're getting there . 
  wow , i ca n't believe you uttered those words . 
  this has ** everything ** to do with low density suburbs . 
  by promoting , and effectively since 50s mandating urban sprawl by law , and [ degenerating public transport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_motors_streetcar_conspiracy ) , us practically is doomed to have low density suburbs . 
  you ca n't provide effective , comfortable , fast and cheap public transport to low density suburbs . 
  they are not dense enough to provide critical mass of people using the system , so for the same money you have to support more kilometers of tracks , catenary system , stops , effectively lowering frequency ( which is crucial ) and size of vehicle - you 're not using metro trains or trams , but buses . 
  this creates a system where you ca n't not have car if you 're not second grade citizen - you need it just to get to work . 
  people , who do n't have a car start are becoming an undercaste . 
  social trust lowers - you 're not meeting other people on street , you 're looking at them through the glass . 
  human health starts to degenerate - you 're not getting even that 15 minute walk from work , and you become obese . 
  your car consumes ungodly amount of gas , and you 're contributing to earth 's demise by increasing global warming . 
  and you have to park near your work . 
  this all can be prevented by proper urbanism . 
  many of them can be renovated to look quite nice , like here : [ 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wvr7xag.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xgwetcq.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/turlej/31160541204/ ) ( [ another ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/turlej/31626797970/ ) ) , [ 4 ] ( http://dolny-slask.org.pl/6070197,foto.html?identity=536362 ) , [ 5 ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1616535/sosnowiec%20sm%20pd/pw1.jpg ) , [ 6 ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1616535/sosnowiec%20sm%20pd/img_2523r.jpg ) , [ 7 ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1616535/remonty/img_2179.jpg ) , [ 8 ] ( https://farm1.staticflickr.com/554/19930537812_e1ce5b4c12_o.jpg ) everything close to services , shops , clinics , public transport .
