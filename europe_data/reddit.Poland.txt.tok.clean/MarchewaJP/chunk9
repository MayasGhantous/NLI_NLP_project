  1286 pln after taxes . 
  we love pizza like this here too . 
  there are exceptions to this rule . 
  at the end , the worst what can happen is 50 pln ( 12 eur ) fine . 
  i think this makes them much worse . 
  because internetional crisis had nothing to do with situation in greece . 
  i hope we will be second . 
  it 's not like they voted for better politicians before . 
  i 'm not talking about bailout . 
  i 'm taking about whole debt . 
  or voting for unstable populist parties . 
  politicians who win elections reflect the society they represent . 
  so they got into 180 % gdp debt by using only 11 % of that money ? 
  talk about greek inefficiency . 
  and yet they complain . 
  so let 's borrow money , and spend it on ... let 's say pensions . 
  this will make gdp higher , because people will have more money to spend !, 
  this worked so well when greeks did it last time !, 
  we never criminalised them . 
  everything other apply . 
  there are regions with 20 % unemployment , and cities with 3 % unemployment - which practically mean there is shortage of workers . 
  guess what - ukrainians go to cities , where they can find work . 
   high unemployment ( non official one ) unofficial is even lower , because many people work illegally , without paying taxes . 
  the official statistics also lag behind with calculating emigration . 
  eurostat numbers are much lower , and closer to the truth than gus statistics . 
  we accept hundreds of thousands ukrainians , we do not demand that italy have to take them . 
  let southern and western europe deal with their migrants and us with ours . 
  yet we accepted 300 000 ukrainians . 
  just not on refugee/asylum status . 
  we strike down asylum applications , because western ukraine is perfectly safe . 
  if you want to come here to study/work just say so , and you will probably get visa . 
  every house has its own colour , not [ this ] ( http://fotopolska.eu/foto/230/230511.jpg ) kind of bullshit . 
  also , i do not think it 's really relevant to compare styles of paining of huge blocks and small houses . 
  really ? 
  we have a 9000 posts long thread on polish skyscrapercity complaining about these . 
  you can make modernisations of those blocks look [ really good ] ( http://i3.fmix.pl/fmi536/c768f00900227a4f55302522 ) if you try not to have color diarrhea . 
  the point is , you can make it look [ really good ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/cc/08/11/z17858764q,tetris---projekt-termomodernizacji-bloku-os--rusa.jpg ) . 
  why not use [ normal ] ( http://www.elfik777.pl/files/file-6a8b336fd08.jpg ) , [ pleasant ] ( http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/2364/teatralne.jpg ) to eye [ colors ] ( http://www.zawisza.net.pl/realizacje/d/blok-mieszkalny-radom.jpg ) ? 
  using pastel colours you 'll end up with shit like [ this ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/4/7540/z7540734x,wojewodzki-sztab-wojskowy-pomalowany-na-zielono-zima.jpg ) . 
  `` how the people in africa not have anything to eat '' we have never been rich , then we were fucked in the ass by history . 
  romania 's history is similiar . 
  tourist/business yeah . 
  j-1 if google or somebody like them sponsors them too . 
  but rest are much harder to get , if you do not have a million dollars to invest in us . 
  and if you do not like to live the live of illegal immigrant ( which highly skilled specialists do not like to live ) , you need immigrant visa . 
  also , process of getting visa is fucking bureaucratic nightmare . 
  please , romanians , do not paint them as shitty as we did .

  is this really decline , or just fast suburbanisation ? 
  we have problems in poland with that . 
  more want welfare than jobs, 
  i strongly believe that politicians actually reflect the society they are elected by . 
  we fucking wish we could fight and have chance to win with fucking soviets in 40s . 
  you had chance poland never had . 
  you are talking about 2004-2007 . 
  we got into schengen in the end of 2007 . 
  yeah , like [ those ] ( http://www.nettg.pl/tmp/images/2013-01/max-800x600/1357286013-grosze01-md.jpg ) . 
  and we are still using 1 grosz coins , worth approximately 1/4 eurocent . 
  i 'd say wyborcza and tvn are just left . 
  far left is something like communists or antifa . 
  they openly endorse razem . 
  and calling wyborcza far-right liberal economy praiser must be a joke . 
   russian reinforcements under prince pozharsky eventually starved the commonwealth garrison ( there were reports of cannibalism ) and forced its surrender on the 1 november ( though some sources give 6 november or 7 november ) after the 19-month siege . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unity_day_ ( russia ), 
  they actually celebrate day when poles occupying kremlin surrendered . 
  well , maybe you 're right . 
  but political culture actually reflects overall culture of society . 
  so what exactly is wrong with this ? 
  db is synonymous with high quality here in poland . 
  and you list it as something not normal . 
  in polish railways there are people standing in the toilets and passes between cars every long weekend or big holiday . 
  also , people entering through windows . 
  that 's quite the case in poland to be honest , but i do not agree with your conclusions . 
  the `` western '' model - like the famous finnish one is better for real life applications . 
  in poland , we 're getting better at doing tests , and worse at creativity . 
  every iteration of matura exam increases this tendency . 
  coupled with increasing centralization of educational system , and mostly shitty tertiary education ( with some exceptions ) , poland 's future does n't look good . 
   however none of them can really tell me why that 's good , what was so wrong with the tapes they are probably happy , that the po is going down regardless of reasons . 
  and to be honest those tapes are n't really incriminating . 
  people dislike po for being lazy , complacent party - and they really present themselves that way in those tapes . 
   all they care about is to keep the power and bash the opposition yeah . 
  the problem is , opposition is n't much better . 
  i guess that 's the problem , it 's really sad . 
  people like sikorski are actually very intelligent , competent politicians . 
  yet out of conformism , complacence , laziness , arrogance and conformity coming from 8 years of easy victories without doing anything their actual actions does not match their real opinions . 
  they do nothing to improve the system , and by doing nothing they yield political discourse to populists and straight idiots . 
  po had 8 years to implement reforms , and they did close to nothing . 
  so now we will have populists , idiots and extremists in government . 
  people will get tired of this bullshit , and will vote for reasonable party , which will grow complacent and lazy . 
  the endless cycle of politics in poland . 
  you should use eurostat data - unified methodology makes them more useful for comparison . 
  and they already have [ nice graph for you . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/25/unemployment_rates%2c_seasonally_adjusted%2c_march_2015.png ), 
  another solution might be to improve public transportation in places , where space exists . 
  the seaside part of a country is basically cheaper italy , with beautiful towns , great beaches ( unfortunately , stone ones , with urchins ) . 
  and it is affordable for poles . 
  wait , is polish really that hard for ukrainian ? 
  i learn russian now , and it is fairly easy , much easier than german which i learned in high school . 
   btw , seven genders in polish ? 
  how 's that possible ?
