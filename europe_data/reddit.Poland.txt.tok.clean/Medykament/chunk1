pretty much , yeah . 
  but that 's the point . 
  he sacrificed it * in russia * . 
  no matter the sacrifice , we were given the chance to fight the enemy . 
  it 's hard to grasp our mentality but think of it like that : we went through 3 partitions . 
  first one was the russian , prussian and austrian . 
  second one was both russian and prussian ( austria was too busy fighting with france this time around . ), 
  third one was russian , prussian and austrian . 
  throughout the 3 partitions , russia took most ouf our core provinces . 
  just look at the wiki page for the summary of polish partitions : https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=partitions_of_poland&amp;section=5#summary it did n't matter that we were sent to fight a war that we were destined to lose , all that matter was that we were given an opportunity to fight . 
  again with our anthem , but the part :  bonaparte has given us the example   of how we should prevail . 
  is really important . 
  bonaparte revolution gave us * `` ludzie wolni s\u0105 bra\u0107mi '' * , the '' * free people are brothers * '' that was the motto of revolution and d\u0105browski legions and the fight against russia at that time . 
  after third partition of poland many officers fled to both italy and france . 
  in 1787 jan d\u0105browski signed agreement with italy ( then lombardian republic ) and france to create polish legions , a military unit in italy that were given both polish uniforms and insygnia . 
  we fought alongside italian and french armies in 1797-1807 . 
  it may sound insignificant to anybody who does n't know polish history but we were give both reason and resources to fight . 
  it was a fundation for army without nation that fought for independence . 
  i 'll give you imo the most important historical reason for our friendliness towards italiy : polish legions . 
  they were a polish military formation created on the italian soil by jan d\u0105browski with the patronage and help from france and italy . 
  they fought alongside the italian and french forces in 1797-1807 . 
  even our national anthem `` poland is not yet lost '' ( that was created in reggio nell 'em ilia by j\u00f3zef wybicki ) goes like :   `` march , march , d\u0105browski ,   from the italian land to poland . 
    under your command   we shall rejoin the nation . 
  * we were given polish uniforms and insygnia even though our country was partitioned and wiped from the map . 
  we were given reason to fight . 
  we were given resources to fight even though our forces were at most at 8 thousand men . 
  the help given to us was the fuel for the spark of polish revolution . 
  and belive me when i say that poles love to remember both their enemies and their allies . 
  for every historical grudge we hold , there 's a historical friendship we try to cherish . 
  even in poland we used to call it franca ( never heard it being called german disease actually . ), 
  i donated more than usually because of the increasing attacks . 
  i do n't want government interfering and telling me where to donate my money so i simply gave more out of spite . 
  it 's not going to freeze over as long as we have coal to heat it up , 
  the resident bear in my workplace just woke up from winter hibernation so productivity skyrocketed !, 
  ^ ^ same ^ ^ with ^ ^ maulings ^ ^ and ^ ^ other ^ ^ bear ^ ^ related ^ ^ work ^ ^ accidents . 
  of all the people that i know that know anything about pottsdam , yaltan and teheran conferences ( that shaped the post-war europe and poland ) no one is holding any grudges . 
  it 's important to remember the past but also to forgive i 'm old enough to remember people cheering when russian troops left \u017baga\u0144 , \u015awi\u0119tosz\u00f3w and boles\u0142awiec in 1992/1993 and i 'm happy now that our strongest ally will be stationing there . 
  at least you guys were invited , 
  polish memorial painted in ukrainian/upa colors with ss symbol ? 
  looks like provocation , not a simple vandalism . 
  i think we should n't go jumping to conclusions with pitchforks in hand and let it worsen our relationship with a entire country . 
  that 's true . 
  but you 'll have to consider that recovered territories were largely unparceled , people were n't that much interested in them and resettlement of people owning land there was easier due to them being quite new part of the country . 
  they were ripe for the taking for the pnz ( which transformed into pgr ), 
  yes , lena is a full name . 
  and yes , franciszek is quite popular . 
  i would say top 20 in male names overall . 
  do you maybe know why the include them ? 
  is there some agenda behind it ? 
  like downplaying suicide rates or inflating homice rates on purpose . 
  because that 's kinda bonkers . 
  we 've kept some of your old ovens around for you if you would like to use them again . 
  really vintage feel to them ^ ^ just ^ ^ please ^ ^ no ^ ^ drang ^ ^ nach ^ ^ osten ^ ^ this ^ ^ time, 
  of course we did n't do that willingly . 
  the reparations were paid to ussr who * paid * us back in marxist literature . 
  the thing is , if there ever was a good period to talk about the reparations , it was when wa\u0142\u0119sa took the role of president , polish government in exile stood down and gave him all their `` power '' and prl dissolved . 
  that opportunity did pass ~ 25 years ago and nowadays we should stop talking about it like germany owes us anything and embrace the status quo . 
  yup , pretty much . 
  we know that the communist government gave up on reparations and we accept that . 
  it 's just a case of '' * lalala ca n't hear you lala give wwii money * '' everytime our government feels threatened by germany . 
  if he was i 'm sorry for not catching that up . 
  latelly i just ca n't really tell even among people i know , let alone strangers on the internet . 
  no , we should n't . 
  we should get along . 
  fight for historical accuracy and truth , while at the same time remember that we 're the new generation striving for betterment of our society . 
  we should mock jingoistic fervour and hysteria . 
  there 's nothing to apologize for . 
  the countries having expensive and ineffective ones should be apologizing . 
  opps , what i mean is martial law . 
  thanks for catching that up , 
  last time we had a * serious * protests was back under communist rule . 
  martial ~ ~ war ~ ~ law was declared , thousands of people were imprisoned without a trial , many people got shot by the military/police etc. 
  once shit goes down in eastern europe it * reeeeeally * goes down . 
  people round here are n't very keen to take part in protests but once they start it turns to euromaidan type of deal . 
   i do n't ask for too much  i do n't want too much  i have n't seen too much  i wo n't see too much   i do n't think too much  i do n't mean too much  i did n't hear too much  i ca n't do too much   freedom - i love and understand it  freedom - i 'm not able to give it away  freedom - i love and understand it  freedom - i 'm not able to give it away , 
  could you use one of the guns that goes [ pfbrrrrrrrrt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pski-jfltee ) ? 
  i like the sound these make . 
  huh , thanks for explaining it . 
  imho comparing to the uk it really sounds silly when us poles with our minority complex want to * `` fuck '' * with the eu status quo becuase we feel like we 're integral part of it . 
  you do n't have a separte word for a birth mother and affinity mother ? 
  there really should be separate words in most of major languages for birth mother and father and step/affinity/blended mother and father . 
  the consuses round * here * is that uk was a part of a triumvirate that ruled the eu ( that us poles could only * dream * of being part of ) right next to france and germany . 
  and now the uk does n't like the eu 's `` tyrannical institution '' that they were a major part of ? 
  holy fuck the absurdity of it all . 
  there were actually quite a few minor outbreaks before and after the * `` black plague '' * but the major ones spread through the trade routes to the big southern european cities . 
  it mostly started in asia but the population denisty of big european trade hubs really let it spread it wings and cover over half of the continent . 
  man , do n't do that . 
  do n't start such topics with  as well as the srebrenica massacre because it makes it look like youre saying `` yeah there was this genocide but look at our genocide ! '', 
  it 's not a competition . 
  i think there 's something wrong with this map . 
  how does it collects data ? 
  it pretty much higlights every road but does n't highlight the actual bike path that i take almost daily to commute . 
  also it highlights a part of the road which forbids the use of bikes . 
  so what you 're saying she has a cassus belli through the lineage ? 
  press ** f ** to pay ~ ~ respects ~ ~ for patriot missiles . 
  in the valley of the blind , the one-eyed man is king . 
  poland strong !, 
  in a way it 's a good thing since legally defining video games as a sport really helps to get a sport visa when there 's some sort of a comptetition abroad . 
  ca n't confirm since we ca n't into space :( though i 'm happy for you guys !, 
  maybe one day you 'll invite us into interstellar commonwealth :d,
