you mean the case we sent you a road salt as a table salt and poisoned alcohol ? 
  have heard there 's been a thing before , maybe for the [ zaolzie ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie ) , i do n't really know . 
  the point is , people talk about it appareantly occuring , but neither i nor my friends ever experienced it . 
  here is one : there are three kind of poles - the south pole , the north pole , and the pole that steals your job . 
  yeah , i heard you got some problems with poles , but i lived in your country 5 years and never ever anyone made me problems . 
  those were actually one of the most nice years of my life . 
  \u010cr is beautiful , all i can say . 
  i ca n't really see what 's their problem with calling black people black . 
  are n't they black and are n't turks , turks ? 
  some people with insecurities , i guess . 
  btw , i 'm polish and got no problem with people joking about us being a cheap labour ( because we actually are one ) , and am doing it myself . 
  just sayin ' if that bugged you , 
  erdogan is the president . 
  he won the elections this year . 
  some theory says we hate in other people what we suck at ourselves . 
  thanks for giving an example , vlad . 
  you better beware who are you calling a coward , you yourself hiding behind a dictator whose only argument is the argument of force . 
  sweden recognized palestine . 
  lieberman said something among the lines _ this conflict 's more complicated than ikea 's furniture _ - or something like that . 
  in poland it 's widely taught , along english - at least in middle school and high school ( in mine high we could choose german/french ) . 
  i wish i could give you more upvotes . 
  nah , that 's pretty normal . 
  i was talking about myself :d but maan , the same shit in poland . 
  exactly the same . 
   2 ) in greece , the same people ( those that are hated ) are elected over and over again and they will again be elected . 
  quote me on that . 
  funny how things you thought apply only to your country actually happen elsewhere too . 
  but that 's ** a passport ** . 
  it 's a identification document you use ** all over the world ** . 
  it 's got to be in english - not french , polish or , i do n't know , chinese - in order to be understood worldwide . 
  french is n't taught everywhere , but - surprise , surprise - english is . 
  when and where was kazakhstan considered european ? 
  i hear about that idea for the first time in my life :o, 
  question of the year : who gives a fuck ? 
  noone can compare to commies . 
  thought no need to mention that , 
  hard to say , most of them are pretty shitty ( welcome to poland ) . 
  though definitely antoni macierewicz , known for his pointless theories ( see the smolensk crash ) is one of the worst . 
  tell me , what 's repressive about learning english . 
  i did n't say either of the cities is better than the other one . 
  you brought that topic up now . 
   why anyone would want to destroy it ? 
  i do n't know . 
  it was years ago and i do n't even remember who popped out with this idea . 
  okay , so i guess that theory of mine was n't that valid after all :d anyways , warsaw has it ** too ** . 
  and it 's its symbol ** too ** . 
  that 's probably closer to reality now . 
  true , but when you see a picture of it , do you first think of warsaw or moscow ? 
   say that the best building in warsaw is that big soviet palace thing . 
  just for the record : when a plan of destroying the palace of culture and science appeared , practically all people said no , since it 's warsaw 's symbol . 
  we rather consider it a polish eiffel tower than something we do n't want or are ashamed of . 
  i suppose we both just agree it depends on context , 
  great pics !, 
  thanks for sharing , 
  i 'd see him as a threat if he waved a terrorist organisation 's flag . 
  ignorant people are paranoic about things they do n't understand/don ' t know . 
  pole is a completely normal denonym , just like polish . 
  polack is appareantly offensive , but i do n't find it offensive in any way . 
  and it sounds similar to polak , which means _ a pole _ in polish , 
  i do n't really think there anything more than that . 
  but i might be biased , i have n't been in poland for years . 
  we have a lot of talking about drunk drivers , especially on days like al saint 's day , new years eve etc. 
  is it what you meant ? 
  i 've lived there for 5 years , the landscapes are stunning , people are decent , and if you still want a big city , [ ostrava ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrava ) is nearby . 
  being from poland myself , i need to admit you have a valid point , sadly . 
  yup , 2004 , they joined the same day poland did . 
  yeah , i know . 
  but otherwise , what 's the point of adding some minuscule island in oceania or an american state to ** european ** union ? 
  they likely already have their own unions anyway . 
  and besides , if turks ever get rid of politicians like erdogan , i 'll welcome them in ue with open hands . 
  they are in the eu since 2004 . 
  geographically they 're more european than many countries listed here . 
  edit - spelling . 
  russian troops enter ukraine , but of course russia is n't willing to admit it . 
  why should we do anything ? 
  it 's arabs ' thing . 
  if they ask for help , let 's help , but why commit by ourselves ? 
  what 's wrong about that ? 
  win/win . 
  good i did n't say how much i bet . 
  i thought you are in eu . 
  i bet the map 's for eu countries only . 
  november 11 . 
  you know , pilsudzki , world war i. 
  communist regime rather celebrated july 22 , the day when polish comitee of national liberation published their [ manifesto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pkwn_manifesto ) . 
  i was born in poland . 
  i had spent half of my life in poland . 
  ** so polish ** . 
  in a more broad term , i hesitate between european and central european : i feel more related to central european countries like czech or slovak republic , since they are closer to us mentally and culturally - but at the other hand , we are all from europe . 
  i do n't fully understand where are you coming from . 
  _ baba _ is a rather obnoxious name for a woman , at least in a common language . 
  hence _ chick 's _ , for a lack of a better word . 
  would agree with _ babcia _ / _ babka _ though , despite the similarity of these words ( hence _ grandma 's _ ) . 
  ** polish ** * ** indian summer ** - _ babie lato _ ( grandma 's summer ; or chick 's summer ) * ** milky way ** - _ droga mleczna _ ( literally ) * ** sunshower ** - i 've got no clue  * ** go\u0142oled\u017a / czarny l\u00f3d ** - '' _ black ice _ '' - a transparent layer of ice on a road ; appears when a rain falls on a ground that has below-zero temperature . 
  [ edit - spelling ], 
  poland . 
  ** the most ** : germany/czech republic ** the least ** : russia, 
  ** fun fact ** : polish parliament resides on wiejska st. ( village st. ) , and polish colloquial for mess and lack of class is wie\u015b or wiocha ( village ) . 
  which describes our politics perfectly . 
  / / _ the difference in the name `` wie\u015b '' and `` wiocha '' is a place , while `` wiejska '' is an adjective from it .
