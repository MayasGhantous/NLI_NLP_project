  in poland all street names are adjectives . _, 
  wojew\u00f3dzki is little better than karol strasburger in the matter of jokes , so that 's a no for me . 
  i honestly never heard of ranczo . 
  i once or twice watched kiepscy , but that was too stupid humour for me ( although i have heard some seasons are better ) . 
  for radio , only [ polish radio tr\u00f3jka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polskie_radio_program_iii ) is considerable , especially on friday late afternoons/evenings . 
  but only in the matters of music , news are the same by subject . 
  edit spelling, 
  i know  honestly speaking , i do n't follow polish mass media for a choice rather than laziness or some incapabilities . 
  ** they have nothing interesting to offer . 
  ** they keep mostly sticking up to politics , accidents and bad news for what remember from years ago , and when i made a research for this thread yesterday i simply wanted to puke , because nothing changed . 
  tv shows were ever no good either , foreign are really much better ( though not every either ) . 
  i 've heard about it on reddit . 
  i did n't although see much about it in polish news sites . 
  i do n't live in poland for 2.5 years , so i can tell for neither radio , tv nor common people around . 
  ** poland ** \u2022 pkp intercity ( the railway ) wrongly counted kilometers , eventually raising the price of a ticket . 
  it will give back the money [ onet ] ( http://m.onet.pl/wiadomosci/kraj,e4np9 ) \u2022 the prime minister donald tusk attends the police 's 95th birthday . 
  he says they always have the country 's support [ onet ] ( http://m.onet.pl/wiadomosci/kraj,wkb5c ) \u2022 problems with the swinoujscie gazoport ( lng terminal ) . 
  yet this year , psl wants to pass a bill that will forbid foreigners to buy agricultural land after 2016 , called `` protection of land against uncontrolled redemption '' [ tvn24bis ] ( http://tvn24bis.pl/informacje,187/ziemia-tylko-dla-polaka-ustawa-o-jej-ochronie-jeszcze-w-tym-roku,453527.html ) \u2022 president bronislaw komorowski : regression towards russia is a road to nowhere [ interia ] ( http://m.interia.pl/fakty/news,nid,1475263 ) \u2022 the case of korwin-mikke slapping boni gets to warsaw district court [ interia ] ( http://m.interia.pl/fakty/news,nid,1474689 ), 
  no problem . 
  that was just for clarification . 
  nationwide unconditional love to uncle america perished long time ago , 
  _ polish government loves sucking us dick , just how it is _ ftfy . 
  your dreams seems just like mine about american dream . 
  never been to america , but always wanted to live there , though many other rich countries with easier entering conditions for poles are around . 
  well , first maybe try some summer job ? 
  that should give you some image of how things are in a country you choose . 
  also , remember ex-communist block ( poland , czech republic and eastwards ) is poorer than the western and scandinavian part , but is slowly catching up . 
  edit we are n't racist as a whole population . 
  in former communist block people are generally some more conservative , but are not aggresive towards foreigners . 
  there is [ some racist percent ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2b2kgm/is_it_worth_immigrating_to_the_european_continent/cj1716p ) in every country , but they are avoidable . 
  so i can see it 's not just poles not trusting russians about that kind of thing . 
  russia will probably cooperate as much as it does about the smolensk crash - which is n't really optimistic . 
  they are extremely lazy and loud . 
  and they do n't really want to integrate . 
  ** source ** : i lived 10 years across the street with them . 
  my mother taught a few at school . 
  but are you sure showing putin he can do anything is good anyway ? 
  thanks to them even poland can win something . 
  we will always remember about your glorious generosity , san marino !, 
  let me have some hope . 
  frankly , i 've never thought of montenegro as a micronation as such . 
  i know you 're small guys , but i always considered andorra , liechtenstein , san marino and vaticano as ones , since none of them does even reach 100,000 in population . 
  c'mon , serbia is n't really a micronation :d more like san marino , monaco and such .

  you got enough votes = you enter the parliament . 
  you are n't the only if others have enough votes too . 
  thanks for the response !, 
   i found it kinda weird . 
  both the fact he , as the president , basically uses a foreign langauge to communicate in his own country and people do n't seem surprised or shocked about it . 
   we do n't care of course you do n't . 
  people voted for her , so she entered the parliament . 
  ** that 's how democracy works ** . 
  lol 'd . 
  i love how people in poland give a lot of unnecesar fuck about others ' lives and think they have a holy right to and how they always have an opinion for everything instead of healthy give-no-crap approach . 
  grodzka 's life , grodzka 's choice . 
  not your problem . 
  i have two simple questions , think about them : 1 . who gave you a right to decide what 's right for someone else ? 
  did anna hurt you personally ? 
  did she threaten you or your family/friends ? 
  her only sin is that she is famous for being a transgender rather than being simply a good politican . 
  but transgender imposes no threat to you . 
  then why give a damn ? 
  and a ` context ' response to your comment : wan na be a rabbit ? 
  be a rabbit . 
  i do n't care . 
  bosnia and herzegovina : on srebrenica massacre 's 19 . anniversary the recognized victins were buried - [ onet.pl ] ( http://m.onet.pl/wiadomosci/swiat,g33j9 ) that 's all i found in polish web . 
  somewhere on reddit i saw a news about his first speech in belarussian from this year 's independence day . 
  it also stated he usually uses russian and may barely speak any belarussian . 
  how true is that ? 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.rferl.mobi/a/shocking-belarusian-president-speaks-belarusian-lukashenka/25443432.html ) is a link . 
  i 'd argue about some parts of their history , though . 
  seen . 
  was never sure about the parlament-sejm relationship . 
  thanks !, 
  besides of sejm , we also have parlament , do n't we ? 
  in poland we call it `` parlament '' , not `` zgromadzenie narodowe '' . 
  german death camps . 
  not polish . 
  pretty much the opposite here . 
  i 'm not in poland already the third year in a row , but where i live now , i 'm probably one of two or three people in 20-people class , who does n't have snapchat . 
  i 've never seen a point in using it anyway . 
  - ski is more for polish , though . 
  beaches beautiful , but baltic is cold . 
  or czech republic . 
  did n't you know they 're digging sea in there ? 
  lol :d i always considered it a cheap one . 
  always sold in these cheap discounts like biedronka or netto . 
  edit : i am an idiot . 
  just noticed your comment be a joke . 
  hey , we have clever in poland too !, 
  football is extremely popular . 
  but every pole is also a specialist in ski jumping , f1 and several other sports . 
  speedway is also huge in poland , but limited to few cities that suck in football . 
  we 're poles . 
  we 're experts on everything . 
  praga ( prague ) is also a district of warsaw , poland :d, 
  boy , in poland `` rumun '' is a peyorative name for a gipsy .
