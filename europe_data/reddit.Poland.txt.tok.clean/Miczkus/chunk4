  riots , violence , creation of ghettos , sharia law movements and therefore terrorism , rape etc. 
  also the social benefit costs . 
  insane !!!, 
  do you mean the no go zones that turn out to never exist , taxi drivers going full retard because there 's competition , [ reformed political party ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/reformed_political_party ) and [ christian people 's party ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_peoples_alliance ) ? 
  btw , westerners rape , too . 
   let me remind you . 
  which latest terrorist attacks were on a islam-related backgrounds ? 
  all of them . 
  the last few ? 
  might be . 
  many others ? 
  [ no ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html ) and [ no ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/15/yes-there-are-christian-terrorists.html ) . 
  should we fear christians now ? 
   in this case you need to . 
  so nothing changes and shit still happens ? 
  good luck . 
  these guys are cute . 
  when they say shit it 's _ muh freedom of speech ! _ , but when anyone disagrees with them/asks for validation of their claims , it 's _ counterfactual _ and _ uneducated _ . 
  they make for such a good comedy . 
  then educate me . 
  i do n't see a relation between terrorism and muslim immigration , but i see a relation between crime and being poor . 
  you do n't fight crime and inequality with more alienating . 
  it simply does n't work . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm ridiculous and counterfactual for asking for a source ? 
  yeah , you are right - no point in dragging that any further . 
  would like some stats on that . 
  are n't refugees seeking a better life , too ? 
  oh , right , apparently they all just want to kill us . 
  yeah , like , all of them . 
  awww , how cute < 3, 
  me neither . 
  i 'm tired of my people 's shit , they fail so much at looking though another 's perspective . 
  a nation of immigrants does n't understand immigrants . 
  i love this country . 
  spain is n't all of europe . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alawites ) is your friend . 
  where do you live ? 
  but they 're still more representative of a general muslim mindset than some random video on the internet . 
  i know about the generation thing . 
  the integration is n't well thought through , so they still feel alienated ( lack of jobs + feeling of being different + prevalent stereotypes ) , hence radicalization . 
  well , this is a good point . 
  still , generalization is bad . 
  in bahrain i met people who are more open minded than an average pole and saudi arabia is just a stone 's throw from the island . 
  speaks volumes . 
  unless you forgot ' / s ' . 
  he made privacy a hot topic . 
  how is that not a positive thing ? 
  there is a difference between aknowledging some muslims are just shitty and saying they are all scum because they are muslim . 
  just a follow-up question , when you hear about christian parents bullying their gay kid , do you also assume all christians are shit ? 
  i 'm not a patriotic kind of person . 
  i 'd rather live comfortably somewhere else than spent time in a warzone . 
  i do n't consider my homeland as _ mine _ . 
  it 's just another country , yet another patch of land . 
  i spent half of my life abroad ; i 'm perfectly comfortable with living as an immigrant . 
  of course i ca n't speak for others , but that 's exactly my point - if you want to protect your country , go on . 
  it 's a completely fine thing to do . 
  but do n't tell others to do it if they do n't want to . 
  this is a life changing decision and therefore should be just that - a decision ; a choice . 
  it 's not wrong to defend your country . 
  it 's wrong to be forced to defend your country . 
  why would we need the city anyway ? 
  let 's work on what we have now ; we can do it . 
  to some extent also dissatisfaction with politics and lack of improvement . 
  no shit ? 
  hope not . 
  we 've got enough of space and problems on our own . 
  prague , paris and london . 
  i do n't know about czechs ( i have n't really noticed that when i lived there ) , but poles generally like to prove their abilities even if they have none . 
  a self-esteem thing . 
   what the hell is with czechs just exploring the mountain without proper equipment and while wearing flip flops ? 
  ignorance mixed with the confidence in their own abilities . 
  i do n't even know as which they are defined :d i though think they are pretty balkan . 
  they have common history with the peninsula and are close geographically . 
  well , yes - i guess :d but i meant mentally , too . 
  religion is a private matter . 
  holocaust should be taught to everyone attending school . 
  in polish ` prawo ' means ` law ' , besides of ` right ' , 
  man , that happens in poland year by year . 
  i really miss long days like this . 
  days are ridiculously short where i live . 
  more like drunk german ; , 
  it 's not the only group behaving like that . 
  it 's the only group you hear about behaving like that . 
  [ islam is not the only religion/ideology that contains extremists ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html ) - but somehow the only one you see being talked about . 
  do you realize people will say exactly the same thing about us in 10-15 centuries time ? 
  some do , some do n't . 
  and you know , we can joke and all , but things are funny only to some extent . 
  further it 's only rude , and joking for the sole sake of offending misses the point of satire . 
  not to say killing for that is okay , but to yell ` terrorist ! ', 
  or ` fuck off , sandnigger ! ', 
  every time a muslim says he is offended is n't either . 
  i said ` to protest ' , not ` to get him killed ' . 
  i 'm by no means supporting murder . 
  it 's not islam that has issues . 
  it 's the people . 
  if you remove islam ( or religions in general ) , people will find another reason to hate each other . 
  that is just in our nature . 
  by today standards , he 'd surely be a pedo . 
  but mind you , he lived in 7th century , and it was n't something unusual back then .
