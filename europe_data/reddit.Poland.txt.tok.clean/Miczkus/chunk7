  i 'm really tired of this bullshit attitude that europeans committing a crime is something usual or untrue . 
  crime has no ethnicity . 
  if i came and constantly kept kicking your ass , would you really just say _ fuck it _ and let me continue it ? 
  yeah , because it 's ukraine 's fault the russian government consists of a bunch of dicks . 
  til : there is someone outside the royal family that actually gives a fuck about the whole thing . 
  brave new world . 
  i know , right ? 
  this guy is nuts . 
  no idea . 
  only heard the story that it 's a knight . 
  i do n't know about kings , but we have a legend which says the sleeping knight who makes up [ the giewont mountain ] ( http://m.imgur.com/s3oq0b2 ) will wake up when shit hits the fan and defend the country . 
  and morals are a very subjective thing . 
  this is the coolest comment about the issue so far . 
  back in poland we get very emotional about it ( understandable ) instead of sticking to the facts and very little people actually keep it cool . 
  such our national trait , though . 
  similar to we have in poland , but we - generally - rent for decades . 
  suomi \u2764 may our drinking connect us all , 
  there are other countries besides these three , you know ? 
  it 's still interesting though how much we care about number of women in one field ( here : tech ) , but give near to zero fucks about number of men in another ( like nursing ) . 
  double standards much ? 
  the _ mrm is a hate group _ sentiment could n't be more wrong . 
  they have their issues , but they are n't a hate group . 
  it 's like to say feminism is a hate group , too - in the end , there are feminists who do actually hate men . 
  and there are mras who hate women , but they 're to mrm what feminazis are to feminism . 
  also , remember that men do n't have much space in which they could discuss their issues as most of society focuses on women 's problems . 
  there are men who did really have a tough luck with the system or relations with people in general ( both of which often favors women ) - mrm forums are a places where they can feel welcome . 
  ** calling mrm a hate group is unfair to them , is n't helping anyone and only fuels the _ us vs them _ mentality ** . 
  my main issue with mrm ( and feminism ) is that it focuses solely on men 's issues ( and feminism only on women 's ) . 
  that 's why i 'm an egalitarian , as i 'd rather help with everyone 's issues instead of being gender/race/etc . 
  specific . 
  that helps in having the healthy balance and perspective . 
  also , some mrm forums - like / r/mensrights - focuses too much on pointing out feminism 's sins instead of pushing the agenda of helping men in getting fair treatment . 
  unfortunately , it 's often the case that people think being a bitch/dick equals being confident and independent . 
  not to say there does n't exist the sentiment you talk about - it 's simply not always the case . 
  i think i see . 
  _ positive discrimination _ does n't seem to make much sense at the first glance . 
   positive discrimination wtf ? 
  true , but some people may not be even aware of the issues ( or they do consider them normal ) , or the mrm 's existence . 
  while i do n't consider myself an mra ( but rather an egalitarian ) , i think we should post this kind of threads elsewhere , as long as their context is relevant to the subreddit they 're posted into . 
   the general government [ ... ] was ** an occupied area ** of the second republic of poland that was ** under the colonial administration of nazi germany ** during world war ii , [ ... ] did n't they teach you how to read ? 
  we were an occupied country , we had no say in what happens ; germany was the one distributing orders . 
  therefore we were nazis just in symbolism , ** as it was forced on us ** ; in practice , the population was anything but nazi . 
  it does n't matter whether it 's just one card , or all cards . 
  does n't matter if it was on purpose or just a mistake . 
  the shit is done . 
  and we just want to stick to the facts . 
  mattel does n't have to apologize , it 'll be enough if they just admit the mistake and correct it . 
  we 've been calling the third reich _ nazi germany _ , because they are nazi . 
  calling poland _ nazi poland _ is misleading - not the title . 
  it does n't matter whether they meant it or just missed a word accidentally , they got ta stick to the facts if they make a product based on real events - we all do . 
  yet it has more in common with european countries than with the mena region . 
  yes , it does . 
   bosnia  asiatic culture wat ? 
  what are you smoking ? 
  european or not european . 
  does n't matter . 
  saying either is true is n't racist . 
  you 're being paranoid . 
  wait , what ? 
  kazakhstan is not culturally european , but nobody said it makes it worse than europe . 
  also , you yourself said america is better touristically . 
  i 've been to neither countries , but you 're a hipocrite at very least . 
  part of their territory actually is . 
  though there is too little people there to consider it european , that is true . 
  it 'd would have to go through some reforms to improve the economy first , but i do n't mind the general idea of georgia joining ue . 
  i have to agree . 
  if not the wars , the migration would still be there , but way smaller . 
  i know , right ? 
  and of course all french are saints . 
  damn , rape is bad , but it 's got nothing to do with nationality . 
  it happens everywhere , sadly . 
  no shit man . 
  these middle-schoolers have definitely too much time . 
  and yet we dare to shit on russians for that . 
  but it is technically a religious clash , so what 's your problem ? 
  are you sarcastic or just butthurt ? 
  it 's not racist , and i say that as a leftist . 
  well , as long as they 're not being pricks - i 'm completely ok with them . 
  i 've been an emigrant myself for almost half of my life and i know how it feels like to be the different one . 
  being hostile does n't help . 
  being fair does . 
  of course some immigrants will be pricks , criminals , perverts . 
  just like the locals . 
  treating either of them worse than the other is not gon na help . 
  and by fair i mean sticking to the law and facts , emotions aside . 
  we do n't have brains so the hearts lead us on . 
  [ edit ]  do you have different views on immigration within europe as opposed to outside of europe ? 
  as the matter of fact , i 've been an immigrant both in and outside of europe ( poland -  czech and poland -  bahrain ) . 
  does n't reallly change much . 
  immigration is immigration , no matter how close or far the cultures are . 
  our partisans are waiting !, 
  polish nationalists have a group orgasm . 
  the prices tho . 
  germany ? 
  it did n't go well last time . 
  my money 's on czech republic . 
  we need their atheism and sense of humour .
