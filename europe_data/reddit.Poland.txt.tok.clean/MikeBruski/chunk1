ah yes , lets leave it to the great countries of burkina faso and guatemala to lead the way ... 
  sounds like your guide was a dick `` haha , we overpopulate our cities and cause massive airpollution , but you 9 million in total ? 
  fuck you sweden , start reproducing ! '', 
  sheep god more like it, 
  so did brazil , and look what fifa made them do . 
  lived , yes . 
  i 'm living in uae now . 
  so using your logic , try living in porto a few months . 
  2 weeks is not the same as spending months living in a city and feeling its soul . 
  i 've spent a lot of time in lisbon , at all times of the year . 
  and while i prefer lisbon over e.g. 
  paris or rome , porto is far more intimate and dramatic a city ( the narrow river , the steep rocksides , the ocean , the hills and the views ) , plus for me , porto has better food , 
  dude wtf , i 'm not even portuguese , yet alone portuense . 
  i 'm just speaking the truth . 
  very often portugal gets reduced to `` lisbon & co. '' , when its a beautiful country with so much more to offer . 
  dont get all defensive . 
  btw , have you spent a couple of months living in porto ? 
  you forgot the picture of drunk ass british/dutch teenage tourists vomiting on the beach in albufeira ... 
  aaaaaaaaand once again , portugal seems to consist of one city only , lisbon . 
  forget the huge university city of coimbra and the city that gave the country its name , porto . 
  no , lets just all go to lisbon and cram more people into its already narrow and crowded streets . 
  for those of you who have been to lisbon and think youve been to portugal , you aint seen nothing . 
  going up north is eyeopening and porto is an incredible city with a great university and tripadvisors best european destination for 2014 . 
  but yea , fuck that , lisbon !!, 
  hey screw you , i 'm from lublin . 
  its a huge university city with lots of foreign students . 
  if this imaginary high speed train would ever be built then i guerantee you that lublin would be very significant . 
  though i agree that lublin between warsaw and krakow is like going from london to paris through amsterdam ... 
  danes call a ripple 171m high `` a mountain '' . 
  and they also have an area called the `` fynen alps '' , where the highest point is a massive 128 meters above sealevel . 
  i heard they supply oxygen tanks at the base for those who want to do the grueling hike all the way to the top . 
  [ look how impressive they are . 
  just look !, 
  hehe , i used to live in mccook . 
  this guy speaks the truth ... just flatness everywhere . 
  why do you think so many polish people leave poland ? 
  the `` going abroad to find work '' is just an excuse ... 
  most movies in cinemas , yes . 
  however , if it 's on tv its dubbed by a lector . 
  movies , tv shows , everything . 
  and what do you think people watch more ? 
  tv or the silver screen ? 
  so true . 
  when i moved to portugal , this is what really surprised me . 
  pretty much every portuguese person speaks and understands spanish at a high level , and many also speak english . 
  in spain , most people have a hard time understanding portuguese and are even worse when it comes to english . 
  it 's sort of like in scandinavia , where every danish person understands swedish , but swedes prefer talking english with danes because they have a hard time getting the danish accent . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  in poland they dont even bother changing the voice actors , its just one guy talking and [ doing the dialog for men , women , kids , dogs , carpets , bananas , everything , while the original audio plays just slightly lower volume than the polish dude 's voice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2msjn23qmfg ) . 
  it 's horrible and a big reason why so many people in poland dont know proper english . 
  can confirm . 
  i 'm born in lublin poland where winter temperatures drop down to -25 every year . 
  i prefer that over the -2 in copenhagen since lublin is dry and bearable . 
  plus , rains less and is less windy . 
  and snow stays for months there , unlike in copenhagen where it usually turns to dark slush within a few days ... 
  the entire cityring line can be [ seen here , with all stations labeled ] ( https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zgxc-q8k_kai.kzg3tymxnhq8 ) . 
  hey now , it wasnt that bad . 
  afterall they did build the ht-terminal building in the 90s ... 
  anyone can look great on a picture inside a castle while wearing a golden dress , tiara and the order of the elephant . 
  even michael moore . 
  you danes should just be happy that joachim isnt the older brother and heir to the throne . 
  german is a compound language meaning that they can keep adding and adding words into words to form a new meaning . 
  same with swedish , norwegian and danish where you can have words like : ** udenrigsministersekret\u00e6rsassistentbolig ** ( which means residence of the assistant of the secretary to the foreign minister ) ** \u00d8restadplanl\u00e6gningsr\u00e5dgiverchauff\u00f8rl\u00f8n ** ( salary of the driver to the \u00d8restad ( new area of copenhagen ) planning advisor ) ** br\u00f8ndby\u00f8sterstationvedligholdelsesbudgetr\u00e5d ** ( the br\u00f8ndby\u00d8ster ( metro station in copenhagen ) station 's maintanence budget council ) ** speciall\u00e6gepraksisplanl\u00e6gningsstabiliseringsperiode ** ( period of plan stabilising for a specialist doctor 's practice ) ** multiplikationsudregningstabelsh\u00e6fteopbevaringsreolsproduktionsfacilitet ** ( production facility of storage shelves of boxes for notebooks for the calculations of multiplication tables ) and if you think that 's bad , here 's an actual swedish word : ** sp\u00e5rvagnsaktiebolagsskensmutsskjutarefackf\u00f6reningspersonalbekl\u00e4dnadsmagasinsf\u00f6rr\u00e5dsf\u00f6rvaltarens ** ( the manager of the depot for the supply of uniforms to the personnel of the track cleaners ' union of the tramway company 's ) in reality its possible to make infinite words because you can just keep adding new words to create new meanings . 
  eg : ** menneskerettighedsorganisationsekret\u00e6ren ** ( the secretary of the human rights organization ** menneskerettighedsorganisationsekret\u00e6rskursus ** ( the course for secretary of the human rights organization ) ** menneskerettighedsorganisationsekret\u00e6rskursusmateriale ** ( the course material for secretary of the human rights organization ) and so on and so on ... 
  '' ** there ** are 3 pigs in a ferrari '' '' ** they 're ** going to drive to uzbekistan '' '' ** their ** ferrari is pink with blue hearts '' you seem to be making this mistake often , stop it . 
  no reason why the friend who fights with you cant also invite you home . 
  and yet , poles still need a visa to go see nyc or l.a. 
  when pretty much every other eu nation doesnt . 
  well close enough doesnt mean correct . 
  the vee would be pronounced like bee , knee , and that 's not how it sounds . 
  polish is difficult , especially for english speakers ( our w 's are like your v 's and all the sz 's , cz 's , rz 's etc ) , so i always try to break it down and make it easier . 
  the hell it ai n't . 
  stolichnaya is poor mans vodka . 
  more like vyh-bo - ** ro ** - vah . 
  ( accent on the penultimate syllable ) the vyh sound is like the first sound in '' * gri * mace '' , '' * bi * n '' , just with a sharp v like in '' * v * ery '' bo sounds like '' * co * p '' without the p ro is like the first sound in '' * ro * ck '' , '' * ro * mney '' '' * ro * gan '' ( sharp rolling r though , think spanish ) vah is basically v like in `` very '' and an open a , like `` b * ah * '' . 
  haram means forbidden halal means allowed . 
  [ relevant , prison in norway ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4beuc3-ckw ), 
  he had an appointment . 
  [ but seriously though ... ] ( http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/swedish-prisoner-escapes-jail-see-dentist-then-turns-himself-back ), 
  considering the swede who recently broke out of jail to go to the dentist ( and promptly returned to jail afterwards ) only got 1 extra day for breaking out , this dude is probably looking at charges for not paying totaling 5 $ . 
  ah yes , the ** caganer ** . 
  he comes [ in all shapes and sizes ] ( http://www.caganer.com/collection-c-40.html ), 
  porto-vigo 150km barcelona-bordeaux 630km slightly bigger difference psychologically , one is a 1,5 hour drive , the other a 6 hour drive, 
  uk is further up north , and further west . 
  hence why winters are darker . 
  summers in scotland are long and bright , with the sun setting around 11pm in june in edinburgh . 
  portugal moving to cet makes no sense . 
  it is in the perfect timezone . 
  i always thought it was stupid that when i lived in porto , portugal , [ an drove 1,5 hours up north , i 'd cross into galicia ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/lscg9 ) and parts of spain that are further west than porto , and yet have to change the clock to one hour ahead . 
  which in the summer meant sunsets at around 10:45 pm instead of 9:45 pm in porto . 
  spain moving its clocks to gmt is the only logical thing to do . 
  dont forget the bicycles and the very flat countryside . 
  bord is table , br\u00f8d ( or br\u00f6d as written here , but with a swedish \u00f6 instead of the danish \u00f8 ) means bread . 
  not the same at all . 
  to be fair , that government and president were pretty shit . 
  most of the people who voted for them were religious , uneducated people from the rural areas , where the majority of poles still live . 
  it 's like usa , the population in the cities is younger and smarter , and in the villages , conservative , religious and intolerant . 
  ladies love red wine ... 
  the dutch are the ones who were contracted to make all those crazy projects in dubai , the palm islands and the world islands . 
  after they are completed , they will add 520km of beaches to dubai .
