  lot 's of fine memes on / r/polska today  https://i.redd.it/nt6cvj27agky.jpg http://i.imgur.com/zt2acif.jpg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siqm6d2bgma&amp;feature=youtu.be, 
  i think you are completely missing the point of my comment . 
  i 'm talking about the council as a whole and not its individual members . 
  ech i was hoping for a reddit silver :(, 
  it kinda does , the whole council is a collective head of state, 
  beacue guilt , fault and wines are all called `` wina '' in polish https://translate.google.pl/#en/pl/guilt%20fault%20and%20wines tusk 's fault is our version of thanks obama, 
  so what 's up with this talk about uk being so unequal and having an elitist society ? 
  they have relatively few billionaires and wealth is evenly distributed . 
  does n't seem so unequal to me, 
  tell me about it . 
  they turn everything around to look as if it 's about them . 
  i also just adore how they use words `` america '' and `` world '' as synonyms , i heard black lives matter movement called `` global '' too many times . 
  who 's shaman banga-banga ? 
  he knows . 
  it was a rhetorical question, 
  eugh , im not even clicking this, 
  yup !, 
  i think you call them `` hartz 4 '' , right ? 
  funny thing is , polish word for a chav is `` dres '' . 
  title can be read both ways -_-, 
  you 're trying to imply , that your cause is somehow more just , than that of scottish independentist , because you won and they demand a second chance after failing . 
  i remember farage talking about another referendum just minutes after voting locals were closed on the brexit day fearing deafeat and i 'm damn sure and you are probably as well that ukip would n't stop pushing for a secession after a failure . 
  that 's not what the map say, 
  put an / s pretty please . 
  i thought you were serious at first glance . 
  this polish yt channel has some beautiful memories passed on by holocaust survivors  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhssjpl7vvg, 
  no no no no not at all . 
  it began in 14th century or even earlier, 
  it 's a trumpet . 
  do n't bother, 
  you should have given us pics directly like the rest does, 
  ian hislop in the back !, 
  i 'm sure she 's grateful for this, 
  jews ? 
  / r/askeurope is for asking this kind of questions, 
  lol you are aware that counless of german-american changed their names in respons to the world wars ? 
  all top 10 of most popular names in us are related to popular germna names . 
  miller - m\u00fcller , smith - schmidt , brown - braun and so on . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's germans , followed by irish . 
  english ancestry is relatively rare, 
  cbos is a government agency controlled by pis, 
  poor fella , he laughs on the outside but cries inside v_v, 
  \u00d3\u00f3\u00f3, 
  i would like that . 
  one bombing of katowice please . 
  i could n't vote for him as well . 
  i 'm not sure you know how european elections work . 
  he was elected from silesia , i 'm from warsaw so i have as much to do with him as you and most of polish citizens anyway i feel like my butthurt is a bit out of place, 
  https://laurencekt.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/macron-jeune-parisien.jpg not that it should be of any importance to french voters , but damn he looked and still looks fine < 3, 
  no shit , really ? 
  and i would presume it 's a ** european ** parliament of which members are split into various fractions according to their views , ideology not nationality . 
  this video blown up over the internet and is posted by all major news outlets , everywhere he 's called `` polish mep '' and people in the comments talk shit about my country , as if he was our president or an official delegation . 
  he 's a fringe politician and an intenet meme here . 
  he represents his voters , not poland . 
  allready posted and discussed . 
  also this mep is not a `` polish mep '' , meps represent citizens not nations . 
  cnn is a shitty source . 
  well so did i, 
  welp , at least you 're not a hypocrite, 
  just after brexit vote ? 
  how convenient, 
  that seems excessive . 
  is that a normal procedure in cases like this ? 
  have you seen their houses ? 
  they live in cardboard boxes o_o, 
  why ?? 
  he 's a scum nothing more . 
  we can kill him and at least bring peace to families and friends of his victims . 
  that 's all breivik is good for . 
  he does n't deserve any rights , he rejected them all by committing his unspeakable crimes . 
  most of university students in europe live in worse conditions than he does !, 
  do you people really feel that this is just ? 
  and where would en marche be put in this scenario ? 
  i hope not in snd , because they obviously wont ally with them, 
  that 's what op really meant and folks here did n't get it . 
  at least your bananas are bend again . 
  that 's something, 
  the difference in class between him and rutte is striking, 
  i just came across this iterpelation to the commision by epp mep saryusz-wolski in the same matter . 
  you are correct there 's a nice paragraph about the name on polish wikipedia `` do xvii wieku w traktatach mi\u0119dzynarodowych i pismach dyplomatycznych u\u017cywana by\u0142a \u0142aci\u0144ska nazwa regnum poloniae magnusque ducatus lithuaniae [ 30 ] [ 31 ] . 
  \u017de\u010dpospolita ) . '', 
  rome never fell :'), 
  your lack of sense of humor suggests other nationality, 
  simply the commonwealth/republic ( rzeczpospolita ) or commonwealth/republic of both nations ( rzeczpospolita obojga narod\u00f3w ) commonwealth and republic are one word in polish, 
   5-10 points was he ? 
  i 'm genuinely asking . 
  i remember them being 1-2 points from each other in swing states, 
  how did you measured that ? 
  who cares ? 
  there 's also the polish argument that 's his family cost of arms was polish suggesting that 's some of his ancestors from long bygone past were from the crown . 
  all this arguing is so petty, 
  because joke . 
  as to your second comment in this chain , i would add that the word rzeczpospolita works in polish as both republic and commonwealth in english . 
  it would be more appropriate to call it `` commonwealth/republic of both nations '' when explaining the name to the foreigners . 
  just for an additional clarity, 
  well it was n't really polish-lithuanian or lithuanian-polish . 
  it 's just a term from english historiography , nothing more, 
  they do this in the uk . 
  since scotland does n't have a real language on their own ( / jk ) , they have pined nationality to the land not the speech .
