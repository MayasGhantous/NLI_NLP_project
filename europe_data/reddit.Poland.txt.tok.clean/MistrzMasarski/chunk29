  oh god not again, 
   most of onr leadership was killed for helping jews please, 
  maybe it 's just me not being a native english speaker but i find it relatively funny . 
  not haha-funny but i did smile, 
  people used to laugh at ukip for getting just one seat with a massive support in england , but they forget that if ukip had got just 10-15 % more from the torries they would not only get more seats but they would take nearly all of them . 
  it might benefit the big two but it puts them on an edge of annihilation with every election ^ ^ damn , ^ ^ i ^ ^ hate ^ ^ conditionals, 
  dear god , how repulsive is that smile, 
  russian hacked this , russians hacked that . 
  is this really that hard to believe that people are stupid and they make stupid decisions ? 
  you ca n't blame everything on putin . 
  it 's intellectually lazy . 
  yes , brexit has n't happened yet . 
  it 's always a valid argument . 
  prove that it did , if you disagree, 
  it 's not like merkel was n't grabbing left-wing voters from greens and spd with her silly environmental policies and wilkommen politik towards refugees . 
  it 's a bit scary how afd is not even taken to account . 
  folks should n't divide political spectrum into establishment and radical politics . 
  it 's dangerous, 
  there was a guy planing to blow up the parliament with a truck full of explosives few years back . 
  he was caught after looking for help online v __ v oh , and a member of parliament 's stuff was once shot to death by a lunatic . 
  i love that song, 
  they do support political parties that advocate unification . 
  the number of seats gained by unionists is steadily dropping . 
  they used to get over 75 % of the votes now they are bellow 50 % . 
  for now, 
  considering their shifting demographics unification of the island is kinda inevitable, 
  let me guess something about muslims ? 
  just joking , do n't read too much into this, 
  and hidden gay lovers, 
  fyrom was a mistake, 
   to take back control of our borders and immigration policy because you get free shots of manpower ? 
  yeah , that 's not motivated by pride at all . 
  hatred towards other europeans is nothing but resonable . 
   to regain sovereignty why wo n't your norther ireland go independent to regain sovereignity from the uk ? 
  eu belongs to its citizens as much as the uk . 
  delusions and national pride again . 
   to end our contributions to the eu budget yes , let 's keep these spare penies we spend up on a trade block that contributed to up to 20 % of our econommy 's growth since we joined !, 
  this is exactly the shortsighted crap a delusional nationalist would say . 
   to give a middle finger to the establishment ouch , you showed them . 
   to broaden our horizons ironic comming from a closeminded brexiteer , is n't it ? 
  and the uk , westminster takes away sovereignty of his region or even his room, 
  too late . 
  delusion and pride are primary reasons for brexit . 
  i have heared brexiteers on reddit talking multiple times of damn australia and new zeland replacing eu and a creation of a political union between commonwealth countries lead by the uk . 
  hypocrisicy and stupidity of these people is stunning . 
   i love polish people < 3 i do n't . 
  nasty little fuckers ruin this country, 
  yes , replacing a neighbouring trade partner with population of 450 million for a one a size of poland on the other side of the globe . 
  no wonder you had enough of experts . 
  you people are completely deluded with hatred towards us . 
  what the heck are you on about , man ? 
  ca n't you read ? 
  everything is in the article . 
  you can agree with it or not , but it 's there, 
  is it just me or are all the posts from guys with israeli flairs about the holocaust ? 
  then they grab the rest of chadec voters and a new party of people dissatisfied with fpo 's centrist appeal emerges on the far right . 
  the circle of political life, 
  macron gay nazi confirmed !, 
  yeah i know . 
  i was goofing around, 
  how about we just take in the western chp led part ? 
  mods keep this up !, 
  let the people know what kind of shits the_donald represents, 
  i beg your pardon !, 
  it 's one of three primary colors and the one that starts the rainbow !, 
  red is the most important of them all !, 
  it should go red-yellow-blue and then orange and green in between the big three !, 
  most of them were 40 + yo women, 
  how dare you ? 
  fuck that !, 
  these mines are ineficient and only cost money , they should not be closed , but privatized . 
  unlike the big state owned mines the smaller private ones bring profits . 
  goverment is not for creating jobs , but for allowing them to be created . 
  poland needs a goverment with balls , one that will stand up to this mafia called '' labour unions '' . 
  coal miners did nothing wrong !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9udyi7exojk it 's explained here, 
  you ignored the point of my comment and went to randomly show off homophobia ? 
  what the heck for ? 
  purple ? 
  there 's no purple in rainbow . 
  they should go with red to make a rainbow , or with red and purple to make an lgbt flag . 
  ffs colors are important !, 
  really ? 
  on / r/europe ? 
  our dicks get hard on ode to joy that said ... freude, 
  haha , most of you are americans that ca n't even pronounce french names correctly . 
  now , that 's just dumb, 
  help me emmanuel macron . 
  you 're my only hope !, 
  it 's `` czechy '' on my only true version of google maps, 
  he would rather suck soros 's limp cock, 
  she 'll do anything to appear more centrist now . 
  just wait for her to take up fillon 's `` christian values '' and some hip cool shit from melenchon :p, 
  i 'm sure lots of french people will forget of fn existence in two weeks t __ t, 
  actually hillary did win the popular vote slightly as the polls predicted, 
  yeah i guess you 're right but still the difference is rather small . 
  the rural/city divided is much more prominent than west/east,

  that was my point . 
  it 's not like ex-russian part is tied to pis and the ex-german one to po,
