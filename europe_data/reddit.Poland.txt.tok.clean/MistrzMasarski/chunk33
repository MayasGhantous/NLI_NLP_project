  you got the rest :d, 
  there 's like a billion of remixes on the intenets of an angry rant made by a fring politician called stonoga after an election defeat .

  i love this song i got from / r/polska by ark of satan about smolensk plane crash in 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fow4o9p9hb4 oh and feel free to visit / r/2137 for fresh pope memes, 
  it 's not that simple edit : if you look at the polls you notice that support for independence did n't move since the last referendum took place . 
  snp needs more support for independence than the slight majority they do n't even have . 
  lots of these folks , that declared they will vote yes , will change their minds in the last moments to vote for safe status quo . 
  besides , scots are n't as open and progressive as they may want you think they are . 
  ukip could have a strong voter base there if it would n't be seen as a party of english nationalists . 
  seems unlikely for scotland to break free now , but demographic trends go against unionists . 
  same thing happens in northern ireland , but slower , more and more people support secession with time . 
  folks also should remember that it 's very likely for queen to die in next 10 years and she plays a vital role in keeping british british . 
  i would give uk 20 more years of existence . 
  i wonder , maybe learning norwegian and running away is n't such a bad idea ? 
  do you need any polish lawyers ? 
  i 'm a gay , liberal atheist . 
  i should fit right in, 
  but the middle is somewhere in poland or belarus : /, 
  would n't that leave romania half empty ? 
  eugh , `` roma strategy '' sounds terrible . 
  better than a `` solution to the gypsy problem '' , but it still seems kinda wrong, 
  oh , abortion tourist here !, 
  i want to get one in every european country . 
  pope benny has way too much free time for shitposting now, 
  i would rather have your constant spring-fall , than our freezing winters and people-melting summers . 
  v __ v, 
  ireland ? 
  it has a mild weather , friendly open people and very high standards of living . 
  they are also lying cheaters . 
  of these 7 recently discovered planets 3 were acctually found by european observatory in chile, 
  it 's a popular dick 's name in poland , wac\u0142aw or wacek . 
  talking about king wac\u0142aw ii on history lessons in primary school is rather challenging for teachers . 
  and what next ? 
  african population is about to triple in the comming years . 
  there is more wars and suffering to come in the 3rd world . 
  are we going to welcome next waves of immigrants and refugees ? 
  this is ridiculously shortsighted . 
  we have experience dealing with this people already and what we have learned through these years , is that they are very difficult to integrate and nearly impossible to assimilate .

  christian faith and tradition is a fundament of european culture and there 's not a singe catholic country that is as intolerant as the least intolerant muslim state . 
  and you are the only one that talks of any persecution, 
  tolerance to intolerance is not liberal or left wing , it 's stupid . 
  sure european muslim have guaranteed rights , that have be protected , but i would like to have a liberal federalist party that oppose immigration from muslim states , to vote for . 
  it 's an expansionist regional power with political class stuck in the cold war . 
  they wo n't join because their rivals and potential targets of expansions are in nato . 
  shitpost - kupost upvote - wg\u00f3rog\u0142os downvote - wd\u00f3\u0142g\u0142os thread - w\u0105tek, 
  til cool, 
  yup , everyone knows finns are mongoloid, 
   just as a cheesy example , the queen is known as elizabeth ii in england and elizabeth in scotland , as scotland never had an elizabeth i ( as her rule predated the union ) . 
  which is confusing considering that unlike elizabeth i she 's not a queen of england or stotland but a queen of the uk . 
  ca n't help it , i 'm polish . 
  when we catch a nazi bait there 's no comming back from offensive mode, 
  quite ironic considering that germans of your grandpa 's generation were raping , killing and steeling here in a scale not seen in europe ever since . 
  any german should check his grandma 's neck for polish jewelry before making dumb `` polish thieves '' joke imho, 
  some europeans have better stereotypes of us than others . 
  if any i think german ones would be the hurtful ones . 
  if you would ask an average hans about the polen he would go on about car thieves , communism and general poverty . 
  it 's probably because of proximity . 
  we are the closest of relatively `` poor '' countries to them . 
  homolobbies , gender ideology , german influence on the union , cyclists and vegetarians ... or at least that 's what our public broadcaster told me : v, 
  installing gulags and switching english to cyrylic alphabet , commrade !, 
  that 's church and classical latin , i 'm asking about `` french '' latin, 
  yeah from a vandal tribe called silingi . 
  what 's the point of your comment exactly ? 
  i pointed out that he ommited slavs and you jumped into a defensive position just to play a smartass or what ? 
  we were talking about germany not poland . 
  sniff, 
  i 'm eating my breakfast right now @_ @, 
  yeah i know . 
  i simplified it and i think you got my point . 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  berlin , dresden and more were founded by slavic ancestor of germans living there now . 
  whole of former gdr was once slavic speaking but it deluded with influx of german colonists from the west, 
  slavic tribes in the east, 
  pis and militant catholics belive in influence of `` gender studies '' on european culture , that gay people are going to destroy traditional family . 
  there is no big political party they openly accuse of `` genderism '' , it 's allways the west as well as media and elites in a broad sense . 
  there is that infamous priest mr. oko , that pis invited for a lecture in sejm once . 
  he explained how the gay sex works in details , made some analogy to exhaust pipe , generally hatefull and primitive stuff . 
  it reminded me of that `` the eat da poo poo '' meme . 
  it sometimes feels like uganda here . 
  damn i 'm sleepy . 
  i [ 'll probably have to edit this comment tomorrow . 
  where do i begin ... all these stuff around smolensk plane crash , grandpa in wehrmacht , tusk being a `` german '' candidate recently , lots of stuff around gender/homo/lgbt propaganda , ... 
  we do n't talk about it on ze interwebs : v 90 % of population is so embarrassing we should just hide them every time foreign journalists show up, 
  i use popcorn time and sometimes shush.se . 
  i 'm too poor for tv and i hate commercials, 
  like once a month maybe . 
  this christmas ad ? 
  the worst would be probably bierut , stalin 's governor of poland . 
  the best imho was kazimierz iv jagiellonian , he was a gifted and ambitious politician . 
  all national stereotypes are exaggerated . 
  there is some truth in them but usually very little of it . 
  someone has to ... why are they losing votes to fp\u00d6 ( i borrowed the \u00d6 from you ) so quickly ? 
  does this trend still continue ? 
  fdp has feelings too , you know v_v, 
  i would vote nowoczesna , because of their program and because i still have some hope in them po , because of their politicians and razem , because of their voters i wish we had a liberal party like they have in germany , netherlands or uk . 
  one that is n't watered down and that has something more to offfer than just not being the other `` bad '' party . 
  a pragmatic party standing for freedom and equality . 
  i love it !, 
  i 'm clubbing with one italian guy from erasmus for some time now and helping him learn my native speech in the meantime .
