otto von habsburg was a great man . 
  true european , true statesman . 
  godfather of central european family . 
  he cared much about ce states , especially when they were grabbed by soviets after the great betrayal . 
  he played great role in saving austria from becoming yet another communist puppet state . 
  he was less fortunate with poland . 
  he defended polish cause bravely to the end . 
  he , son of the emperor , head of the habsburg family , man of many merits , had to beg british and american officials not to sell poland to soviets ... 
  i remember an interview with him when he described meeting with antony eden - british foreign minister under churchill . 
  eden told him `` to forget about poland '' . 
  quoting habsburg :  there are people who are naturally evil . 
  in my opinion eden , and czech president benes as well , where that kind of people . 
  later , as a mep he stood behind us central europeans during worst times . 
  he organised help for poland during marshall law , the [ pan-european picnic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-european_picnic ) ? 
  yep , that was his idea . 
  he was strong supporter of eu 's expansion to east . 
  man , this guy should have a street in every european city . 
  and last but not least , he was descendant of the fuckin ' jagiello dynasty !, 
  european  central european  west slav  lower silesian ( with galician heritage )  polish . 
  now i do love poland , and i do n't really gradate my feelings towards my country , but then out of all places in my beautiful homeland i want to continue living in my little heimat , lower silesia . 
  i also love the fact that i 'm part of the bigger slavic family . 
  i like the fact , that our languages are so closely related , closer than germanic family for example . 
  i love these posts where slovaks and czechs make fun of polish language and vice versa ;-) i love our traditions and mythology , the fact that our women where equal to men , and we were `` sexualy liberated '' long before it was cool ( check out kupala night ) . 
  looking from the broader perspective i also love that we , europeans ( well most of us , anyway ) have common indo-european roots . 
  i mean it 's mind-boggling that the word `` cow '' has the same root in our languages , or that the concept of the tree of life , father of gods sitting on top and serpent on the bottom is present in hellenic , norse , and slavic mythologies . 
  i love the history that surrounds us and how it connects us in unimaginable ways . 
  like when i learned that my mom speaks french because she read a book about napoleon bonaparte , godfather of the polish national identity . 
  or that my cousin lives because her german grandpa was saved by polish neighbour during wwii . 
  or that my hometown wroc\u0142aw is a city of three nations and that [ silesian piasts eagle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_piasts ) , which czechs made a part of our [ glorious city coa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_wroc%c5%82aw#mediaviewer/file:herb_wroclaw.svg ) , is also present on the crest of liechtenstein . 
  i do n't know about our common identity , whether is forming up or not , but it 's shit like this that makes me feel `` primarily european '' . 
   govnopizdec his username is very adequate . 
  yup , the highest mountain of the glorious lower silesia . 
  we have 16 t in wroc\u0142aw :-) there have been some `` issues '' at the beginning but now i think they 're quite reliable . 
  what 's that `` pshee '' ? 
  i was `` taught '' this in my primary school in rural lower silesia . 
  i 'm 26 . 
  i 'm telling you romania will be the next big thing in europe in the upcoming decades . 
  no , a ban would state that gay marriage is forbidden . 
  the polish constitution on the other hand does n't recognise it . 
  gay marriage is not `` banned '' in poland . 
  wtf ? 
  constitution does not explicitly ban it . 
  it says that marriage is under protection of the commonwealth and defines it as union of man and woman . 
  you can change a definition you know ... 
  what 's up with bulgarians and their desire to be close with russians ? 
  i 've heard back in the day of ussr they wanted to be incorporated into it . 
  are these sentiments of similar origin like in the case of serbia ? 
  i think this is a perfect place to mention this guy : [ merian c. cooper ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merian_c._cooper ) a personification of all those things that connect our nations . 
  this guy is a fucking legend . 
  he founded famous [ ko\u015bciuszko 's squadron ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ko%c5%9bciuszko_squadron ) better known as [ 303 polish fighter squadron ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no._303_polish_fighter_squadron ) , you know , the most successful raf squadron of the battle of britain . 
  he 's polish war hero , decorated [ virtuti militari ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virtuti_militari ) , polish equivalent of medal of honor , by the marshall pi\u0142sudski himself ( our own de gaulle or paton ) . 
  just look at the [ squadron 's emblem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:303_polish_fighter_squadron_badge.jpg ) . 
  white & red stripes , 13 stars , rogatywka ... man , i love our common history !, 
  oh , you also may know him as the producer of the first king kong movie . 
  that plane shooting big ape of empire state ? 
  yup , he starred as pilot . 
  he came to poland shortly after it regained independence . 
  in his family there was the stoy passed between generations . 
  reportedly live of his ancestor was saved by the general pulaski himself and that ancestor sworn that one of his descendants will repay the debt to poland . 
  funny how peoples lives can be bound by the threads of history . 
  bonus : - [ cooper being painted on fulcrum 's tail ] ( http://lotniczapolska.pl/image_big.inc.php?d=i/n&amp;f=4100240d5731355e8097d442081a3cffphoca_thumb_l_dsc_0203.jpg ) - [ another fulcrum with miros\u0142aw feri\u0107 ] ( http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac31/rzpal/mig29feric.jpg3 ) - [ fulcrum shown from above with the emblem ] ( http://theaviationist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mig-29-radom.jpg ), 
  i know it 's easy for the brain to produce correlations like : `` dem eastern europe = bribes !, 
  '' , but it 's simply not true . 
  try bribing your way while drunk in poland . 
  i dare you , i double dare you . 
  well , maybe instead of doing this cheap publicity stunts he could find out _ why _ poles leave poland . 
  i watched this guy a few times talking on a telly and he 's just one big phoney . 
  he will tell you the biggest rubbish just to gain some points from this or another electoral group . 
  like when he argued that apple exporters ' interests are more important than firm stand on sanctions for russia . 
  today i talked with a colleague with whom i share the office . 
  he works in it and earns above average . 
  he also has children and says that it simply to expensive to have kids in poland . 
  you can manage somehow if your salary is good but , you 're fucked up when you 're an average joe . 
  you work your ass off to pay for a private kindergarden 'cause your genius/ignorant ( or simply evil ) government though that since there 's a demographic decline ` we do n't need all of these fancy kindergardens ' . 
  now people fight over a place in public kindergarden . 
  that 's just one example out of many he gave me to show how our politicians openly fight the idea of having children . 
  no wonder he thinks of moving out and it 's a matter of ` when ' rather ` if ' for him . 
  we get it . 
  you 're better people . 
  that would be great , i 'd love to replace my ancient twisted-pair cable with romanian fiber ( afaik poland itself makes some damn good fiber wires ) but , unfortunately , i live in a building with some xvii century bricks . 
  you can not cough on them without alarming city preservationist . 
  the only languages i do n't speak and can understand ( with some increased brain usage ) are slovak and sorbian . 
  maybe czech to some extent . 
  ukrainian has some similar words i can understand separately , but not whole sentences . 
  maybe it 's a question of pronunciation . 
  well , they were n't partitioned just like that . 
  commonwealth was sick in xviii century , i give you that . 
  powers rise and fall , nothing new about it . 
  nevertheless calling poland european underdog is just pure ignorance . 
  please , gain some perspective . 
  poland is over 1000 years old . 
  through most of its history it was independent power in europe . 
  together with lithuania it was major power for more than 400 years ( will see if uk tops that in 2118 ) . 
  the longest period hussar cavalry remained undefeated is 125 years . 
  poland was partitioned for 123 years . 
  to be honest , this historical short-term memory people have , i perceive as helpfull . 
  you just wait 50 years and no one will remember ` polish plumber ' just like no one remembers ` made in germany ' label original purpose . 
  i love good ( in * my * opinion ) polish songs . 
  there are so many of them , this is just a fraction . 
  i tried to mix together different genres .
