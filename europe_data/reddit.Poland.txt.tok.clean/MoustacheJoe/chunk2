  a stranger is always pan/pani ( sir/madam ) to you , even if it 's a young waiter serving you coca-cola at the restaurant and has this fancy name badge like in american movies . 
  socks and sandals ? 
  that 's how poles identify themselves abroad . 
  [ text of their anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnjzvf4ppgw ) is a no-brainer for me , very easy to understand ( also very beautiful ) . 
  i also found a [ webpage in sorbian ] ( http://www.serbske-nowiny.de/index.php?main=docs/main ) and that requires more effort to get the message . 
  anyway i can see that their grammatical structures are very similar to ours . 
  you should visit pozna\u0144 , poland then . 
  yes , yesss !, 
  bring back glory !!!, 
  [ for the emperor !,

  what about swastika ? 
  [ boreyko coat of arms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:pol_coa_boreyko.svg ), 
  if i got a penny every time they mocked poland ... 
  look at [ lw\u00f3w ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1455033&amp;page=5 ) , it 's like krak\u00f3w of the east . 
  lots of architectural gems waiting to be discovered . 
  for this city alone i think it 's worth to drag ukraine on our side . 
  coming to terms with the fact that it 's never going to be polish again i really hope it stays ukrainian and not russian . 
  i would like to post some photos and footage from other cities that day . 
  it 's not like the whole country celebrates independence by burning things . 
  [ here 's tricity ] ( http://www.trojmiasto.pl/_misc/photo.php?id=132583 ) [ military parade in pozna\u0144 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tauwezixciw ), 
  15 is the age of consent in poland . 
  i have friends who dated 16 year olds in their 20s . 
  i think the biggest age difference in couple i know is 8 years . 
  they got together when she was 16 . 
  it 's nothing unusual , at least where i come from . 
  i also had a friend in her early 20s dating 30-something year old single dad . 
  that raised some eyebrows among friends and family but the `` old man '' turned out to be awesome guy and everyone accepted him into family/friends circles very quickly . 
  vladimir vladimirovitch , is that you ? 
  i think , overall , it 's a win for poland . 
  islands , lower silesia has coastline , npd flooded , no kaliningrad . 
  i would miss gda\u0144sk though ... 
  my dad has satellite dish from the nc + provider and like 80 % of the content has the option to switch from lektor to napisy . 
  he 's got napisy set by default . 
  there 's even option to have euronews dubbed in romanian or french . 
  btw , afaik some sejm mps want to enact mandatory subtitles for all of the tv content . 
  afaik pope holds an official title of the king of vatican . 
  it 's absolute elective monarchy . 
  one of the polish wwii era jokes goes like this : a freedom fighter asks another :  -- who would you shoot first ? 
  german or russian ? 
   -- german . 
  business before pleasure . 
  `` typical architecture of polish ( ... ) '' yeah , you did a good job showing them blocks from ukraine or russia in the first 2 pictures . 
  i would still use the eu flair if it was possible to combine it with my current lower silesia flair . 
  well , member states agreed to comply with ecj ruling but , if you 're interested in this kind of political fiction , then sure - they could go awol like germany did back in the day in the league of nations . 
  in that case the european comission would suspend rogue state in the voting rights and cut their funding from the eu 's budget ( ask bulgaria if that 's not `` pressing '' enough ) . 
  you should know that eu member states are economically more interdependent than states of the american union . 
  turning their back on the eu would be devastating for them . 
  also thinking of eu as yet another international body like un is huge incomprehension . 
  lisbon treaty gave the eu a `` legal personality '' ( if that 's a correct english term ... ) . 
  it basically means that eu is a subject of the international law * on its own * . 
  so imho , eu is more than just a supranational body like nafta or whatever . 
  right now it 's the only true functioning confederation in the world . 
  edit : some typos i 've managed to find . 
   it is a confederation , divided into cantons . 
  it morphed into federation in 1848 . 
  what to me is the most interesting thing in switzerland is their unique political system . 
  i would like to see more of the direct democracy in my home province ( lower silesia ) . 
  afaik european commission already gave some funding for developing secure operating system based on unix architecture . 
  andrew tanenbaum - a guy responsible for minix is behind this . 
  * invented whiskey before scots came up with whisky . 
  * beautiful language and folk music . 
  * great football fans , the nicest people of euro 2012 . 
  * the hands that built america , especially brooklyn bridge where they served as guinea pigs for decompression sickness . 
  * they do the best heritage parades . 
  some similarities with poland : * migrant nation . 
  * catholic . 
  * xix century sucked for them . 
  * irish jokes : the original polish jokes in america . 
  * considered underdogs by historical ignorants . 
  * lots of o'haras and o'briens ( next to - skis and - ckis ) in u.s. police and fire-fighting force . 
  so , game consoles for 399 $ instead of 399 $ ? 
  awww , yiss !, 
  note : 399 usd is 405 cad . 
  that would be awesome . 
  however all parties would have to agree to sustain the federation and that would be hard if not impossible ( tocqueville has some great remarks about that regarding usa from 1830s ) . 
  my great-granddad was an imperial-royal army soldier from west galicia ( or just galicia because that geographical division seems odd to poles ) , but that did n't stop him from fighting for united poland after 1918 . 
  i doubt that poles would be satisfied with west galicia only and with lands north to bohemia , which are considered a cradle polish statehood , left under prussian administration . 
  now consider what we have today . 
  eu is basically a broader confederation of states that participate in similar project voluntarily ( i guess that 's true even for greece ) . 
  i know `` dat nostalgic feel '' but how is that worse than ah ? 
  it 's better . 
  we also have the visegrad group which imho is the best way to bring central european community within the eu back to it 's glory days . 
  whe should invite austrians to the v4 . 
  i know you guys lilke to think you 're westerners but you are central europeans to the bone ;-), 
  it looks like [ maca ] ( http://static.ilewazy.pl/wp-content/uploads/maca-razowa-12g.jpg ) you can buy in poland . 
  it depends on the country . 
  i guess lidl aims at different target groups in different states . 
  in poland they would lost with local dicount house chain `` biedronka '' if they were in the same segment . 
   noso\u010distoplena and you laugh at polish being too descriptive ;-), 
  he was ignorant , pompous idiot who let himself to be manipulated by uncle joe . 
  i do n't know why a guy who profited on and prolonged great depression , who sealed east-west division is so praised by americans . 
  i think [ karski in the interview descibed him perfectly ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pap02us8cym ) . 
  churchill was pushed by roosevelt into corner . 
  terms where dictated by uncle joe and approved by roosevelt ( he probably thought he was the author ) .
