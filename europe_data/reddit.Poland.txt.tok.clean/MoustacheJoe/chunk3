  churchill had to shut up and carry on . 
  shitty !? 
  do n't ruin my childhood , that was one of my favourite shows . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but to my ( basic ) understanding of how today 's macroeconomy works , if you give everyone , let 's say , 500 $ then the markets will adjust by inflating prices to absorb money surplus . 
  anyway it 's a start . 
  someone has to finally address problems of the upcoming `` i robot '' - like future . 
  you 're not alone . 
  this weather prolonged my ski season . 
  it 's the sun i miss ... 
  ostflucht happened in the second half of the xix century . 
  let 's clarify that this `` flooding '' was part of the bigger thing called ostflucht and included all citizens of the reich from eastern provinces like east prussia or duchy of poznan , not just poles . 
  what european countries do you mean specifcally ? 
  indigenous inuits are the majority in greenland . 
  [ lactose intollerance in the world ] ( http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lactose-intolerance.png ) i would n't say _ very common _ but north-south division is noticeable . 
  it 's weird though , because some of the best types of cheese i 've eaten come from italy ( still austrian cheese is the best ) . 
  yes , we do . 
  `` niemcy '' -  `` people who ca n't speak / who do n't know common tongue ( slavic ) '' . 
  i like the story in which croats come from tribe of white croats that inhabited area which is now part of poland and slovakia and founded cities like cracow and sandomierz . 
  maybe it 's only a legend but very cool . 
  i think it 's the opposite . 
  the federation would create need for democratic institutions such as the president 's office or the cabinet . 
  the bureaucracy-led confederation , which is eu today , is lacking democracy . 
  i drink tea with milk and call it ` bavarian tea ' . 
   i do n't know how it became less fitting for polish ( ... ) it never * became * less fitting , because it was never implemented . 
  polish xix-th century patriots , who did their best to preserve polish culture , spared me a lot of trouble getting around typing in two different alphabets . 
  besides poles would never accept cyrillic because it * feels * alien . 
  i do n't know why you have such a problem with the fact that some of the slavs share alphabet with you . 
  look at `` polish-cyrillic '' equivalent of ' \u0105 ' is that easier to write !? 
  polish does n't have cyrillic alphabet and never had . 
  this monstrosity is an idea of oppressors from russian empire who after fall of january uprising dusted off plans for brutal russification of congress poland . 
  to hell with that shit !, 
  i propose all nordics should go back to writing runes , because clearly , latin alphabet does n't fit their languages too . 
  this is oder/odra not donau ... 
  having own fiscal policy can also be disastrous . 
  greeks would probably devaluate their drachma if they were n't in eurozone but that would only postpone the problem . 
  it would be yet another drug shot for a economic morphinist ; sweeping more problems under the rug . 
  jesus huerta de soto , one of the today 's guru of austrian economics , published very interesting article : [ an austrian defense of the euro ] ( http://mises.org/daily/6069/an-austrian-defense-of-the-euro ) , where he clams that the libertarian hate toward euro is irrational . 
  euro , he says , is the closest subtitute of the gold standard whe have today . 
  here 's article in polish : [ austriacka obrona euro ] ( http://mises.pl/blog/2012/07/10/huerta-de-soto-austriacka-obrona-euro/ ), 
  they 'll put [ white eagle ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3e/polish_5-zloty_coin_%281994%29.gif ) on all of them , but [ polish mint ] ( http://www.mennica.com.pl/en/main-page.html ) has a long tradition of issuing quite interesting commemorative coins . 
  they 'll just shift to euro . 
  i 'm not sure if they are alowed to modify also a coin head or just tail though . 
  maybe assault riffles are the problem ? 
  i understand keeping a gun in the house for protection but assault rifles are designed , well ... for assault . 
  public perception may be biased but i still remember my friend 's story when she had to pay 10 000 $ in bribes just to get her sister-in-law 's body ( died of cancer ) back home . 
  afair last winter germany and poland had like six sunny days throughout whole season . 
  if it 's the sun they 're looking after , they picked the wrong hemisphere . 
  you clearly do n't know soviet mentality . 
  the single person able to uphold peace before wwii was stalin . 
  and he deliberately pushed for war . 
  hitler was an `` icebreaker for revolution '' in his grand plan . 
  my country 's entire military was prepared to be invading force for warsaw pact . 
  trust me . 
  if not for nuclear weapons , your country would be obliterated . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
   syrians , for starters , are used to a dual system based in large part on french law yeah , well guess which regime in syria is the closest one to follow this `` french '' law of yours . 
  hint : not daesh . 
  btw : in xix century europe the best criminal law codex was implemented in russian empire . 
  those who now what ohrana was know that having good written law and following it are two different things . 
  [ my former university has mig-29 in their parking lot ] ( http://wroclaw.fotopolska.eu/foto/332/332672.jpg ) . 
  maybe they can sell it to bulgaria ? 
  nice coat of arms . 
  commonwealth confirmed !, 
  one more reason to reinstate the most serene commonwealth . 
  in my city there 's [ ronald reagan roundabout ] ( http://img2.garnek.pl/a.garnek.pl/019/188/19188209_800.0.jpg/rondo-reagana.jpg ) . 
  it 's bank holiday right now in polan and i 'm on my way to work xd, 
  i would feel pretty uncomfortable having breast milk squirted on my suit on tv . 
  see , / u/ephialt3s , this guy 's proves it 's not `` nothing '' . 
  i would unite with slovakia for three reasons : 1 . our languages and cultures are very similar 2 . more tatras 3 . 
  ** we would border hungary again !, 
  i wish the bullshit ( although done in good will ) of one particular italian journalist had been censored during wwii . 
  then today i would n't be facepalming every fucking time i read about polish cavalry charging german tanks . 
  i do n't know exactly why , but they seem to be inclined to polish culture . 
  someone told me they find ` polish soul/spirit ' to be similar to theirs . 
  they see these similarities especially in chopin 's pieces . 
  but many of these laws are anything but progressive . 
  citizenship is not a societal issue . 
  it also sets double standards in terms of citizenship for israeli palestinians . 
  these progressive family laws are disregarded by huge orthodox portion of society . 
  you 've got neighbourhoods where women ca n't go out to school without being harrased . 
  you got to be joking, 
  yeah i remember some butthurt articles about poles wreaking havoc on that ships . 
  turns out both poles and swedes end up swimming in their pukes . 
  thing is poles stay up longer , so they seem louder . 
  heh , that 's interesting . 
  the word for red in polish is * czerwony * and comes form * czerw * which means maggot ( i can see , there 's * \u010derven\u00fd * in cz ) . 
  apparently they used to extract that colour from dried maggots . 
  but we also have the * [ karmazynowy ] ( http://ask4you.eu/images/50012karmazynowy.jpg ) * colour , which seems to be directly linked to persian * kermez * . 
  i 'll tell you when it 's polish . 
  seems to me there 's lots of negative input about poland from banking sector these days . 
  polish government wants to tax big banks , stop capital drain , compensate some people with mortgages in chf ... all that is a direct blow in their interests , so in my opinion , they react . 
  they need to show poland it 's place . 
  suddenly bankers are concerned less about economic performance and more about human rights and freedoms . 
  why would kaczynski oppose the union ? 
  do you have some nato-based sources that confirm that ? 
  afair they have non-profit org called pbs which grants licenses for their content to local broadcasters . 
  i like that idea very much . 
  it 's certainly better than having state-owned media . 
  actually poland and czechoslovakia signed confederation agreement during wwii . 
  hungary was also planned to be part of this .
