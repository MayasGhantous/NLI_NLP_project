  plans were spoiled by the soviets and this whole communism thing . 
  kosovo is not even trying . 
  apart from uk series mentioned here already , i used to watch german cobra 11 and austrian komissar rex which was my favorite series when i was a kid . 
  actually you can buy functioning and very deadly black powder gun ( replicas of pre 1885 models ) without any permit , through internet store and have it delivered by mail to your doorstep . 
  also if you have correct permit , sky is the limit . 
  i know a guy who owns several ak-47s . 
  he shoots from them regularly . 
  he must keep them in special reinforced closed and can be visited by some gun safety inspection without earlier notice . 
   is it really a desire to be decent and not a desire to appear to be decent ? 
  i have a friend who goes to sweden to work each summer . 
  he says swedes are politically correct until they 're absolutely sure they can say what they really think . 
  somehow with poles it 's easier for them to open up . 
  anyway once they do it , they can sound pretty racist . 
  for example : lot 's of them talk shit about bosniaks they took in the '90s during balkan wars . 
  i presume now they would switch to me migrants . 
  maybe my friend just happen to work with swedish rednecks , but the fact is : there are people over there who sound racist even to poles . 
  dude i was joking . 
  it 's hard to draw such conclusions based on handpicked group of pictures of `` special politicians '' . 
  relax . 
  nobody cares about `` true slavicness '' , maybe except russian nationalists and their sympathizers . 
  some say they 're as much slavic as finns nordic . 
  he 's from my district . 
  i voted for him !, 
  when we say someone is `` twardog\u0142owy '' we mean he 's stubborn in his beliefs , like an orthodox or smth . 
  man , i just watched documentary about that battle . 
  biggest marine battle of all time . 
  like when ottomans run out of bullets and started throwing oranges at the soldiers of the holy league and they responded throwing turbans ... with heads inside . 
  tree of life is present in slavic , greek and nordic myths . 
  zeus = = svarog . 
  so i guess he means the foundation myths . 
  i live in wroc\u0142aw and my ex is jewish and now i 'm hitting on another jewish girl . 
  they both have the same name . 
  sometimes universe just wants to fuck with me like that . 
  mad is far better solution . 
  it 's pure maths , based on game theory , conceived by von neumann . 
  anti-missile systems can work against home-made shells in israel , but not against modern rocket warfare . 
  sorry , this was pure sci-fi in the '80s and still pretty much is . 
  more feasible solution would be to fry incoming projectiles with with powerful lasers . 
  that 's what americans are betting now on . 
  still . 
  nothing more would deter russia from attacking poland like good ol' atomics . 
  idk man , a lot has changed since 1968 . 
  we have drones now , sufficient technology to pinpoint and destroy any guerrillas hiding in the army 's way . 
  i 'd also add : thermonuclear weapon ( teller-ulam design ) , crystal growth process ( czochralski process ) , oil refinement process , wipers , cryptographic bomb used to decrypt enigma , reverse polish notation ... and last but not least , w\u00f3dka . 
  you welcome . 
  it does not . 
   and india that 's interesting . 
  northern india perhaps ? 
  we wuz aryuns !, 
  you won , hands down , you won ... 
  i see your zmarzlina and raise you with ** d\u017cd\u017ca ** . 
  bi\u010d pls ... 
  try dis : ** b\u017adzi\u0105gwa **, 
  there are few links , but in polish only ( like [ this one ] ( http://www.tvpparlament.pl/aktualnosci/szczerski-zlozy-wizyte-w-usa-bedzie-rozmawial-o-bezpieczenstwie-i-idei-trojmorza/28852621 ) for example ) . 
  yes , baltic sea , black sea and the adria . 
  it 's basically alternative name to the intermarium . 
   joking aside , how 's the idea of the intermarum doing ? 
  there will be polish-american talks next week about `` the idea of trimarium '' . 
  [ my favorite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu32msefn3c ), 
  i do n't think so , it 's a rip from czech tv . 
  yes . 
  central/eastern europe 's `` horrible '' food is just a page taken from polish traditional restaurant 's menu . 
  * sour dough soup - is n't that just \u017curek ? 
  delicacy . 
  * salted pig fat - that just salo , goes well with vodka and pickles * lard - spread on bread everyday !, 
  goes well with beer * tripe soup - in other words : flaczki . 
  never been fan of , everyone seem to love it * dressed herring - can eat all day , everyday !, 
  * blood sausage - like it grilled , only elders can handle grilling it properly, 
  hungar why ? 
  we used to stick together in our skodas ... 
   `` szczecin '' ( really ? 
  ` zcz ' ? ), 
  where do you think `` stettin '' or `` danzig '' names come from ? 
  these are germanized slavic names . 
  that sounds like an invitation . 
  i remember poles boarding planes to egypt after bomb attack on a correct logic that prices would drop and there 's no germans to steal seats at swimming pool . 
  you may not know this but our glorious commonwealth had border posts and anti-kebab strongholds on what is now moldovan clay . 
  it looks painful to type on keyboard . 
  but i agree . 
  i 'd love to see some road signs with \u0160\u010deb\u0159e\u0161yn instead of szczebrzeszyn . 
  i think orthography is for grammar nazis and everyone should type as he thinks is correct . 
  it used to be like this for centuries and it helps the language to evolve . 
  i 'm pretty sure this was legit at some point of polish history . 
  we had `` kawiarka '' so why not this ? 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm still yet to visit romania , but i 've been fascinated about your country for quite long . 
  my friends went there for bike trip and where in awe . 
  nature , people , architecture , history . 
  i 'll be there in 2017 , no doubt about it !, 
  i would n't underestimate gypsies . 
  they can run pretty intricate crime rings in spain , uk ... 
  i think bbc made a doc about this . 
  and they scoff at our `` cz '' , `` sz '' . 
  it 's clearly easier to type on a keyboard . 
  i think at this point polish people are pretty much aware of romanian ! = gypsy . 
  it that fucking pc media that jams `` romowie '' down people 's throats . 
  poles do n't buy this crap . 
  every pupil in school learns about romanian help during ww2 . 
  and hungary ... well you can not reason with the heart . 
  it 's our loved one .
