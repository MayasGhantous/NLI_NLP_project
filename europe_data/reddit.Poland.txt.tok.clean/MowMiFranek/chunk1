thats the point you labelled everyone in the east as nationalists or alt righters, 
  2017 people still dont know the difference between conservatism and nationalism . 
  aditionally people still dont know that f.e. 
  switzerland is pretty conservative . 
  how many times do we need to go through this, 
  are you saying slovenia is an evil capitalist empire without 1 may holiday ? 
  anyway we still have it free , it was a communist holiday so there is a significant chance for more countries to have it this way . 
  every country can waive one free day for this day . 
  idk how it works in latvia but we have few days which can be easily swapped for this one , like f.e 1st may . 
  we should have it free from work for every eu member . 
  bog honor ojczyzna here, 
   how do you join the top-speed here you need to install intergalactic drive and set it to 100 % power to reach the full speedo , kiddo, 
  we cell it hate preacheing now ? 
  how many more people needs to die for political correctness ? 
  10 % wont make a bigger difference, 
  i knew someone will say this , come on it was a simplification, 
  thanks , do those polls include a possibility of people not admitting to support le pen ? 
  we know what happened in usa , but in austrian polls the right wing candidate was overpomoted . 
  thanks for a summary . 
  could you say a few words about who is the current lewder of polls and what will be the most likely outcome of the second round ? 
  slovenia is the richest ex commie country, 
  you are simply wrong . 
  right now we have 10 % increase of births comparing to a year ago , cross check a data from 30-37 years ago and compare it with last year to year growth , the rapid jump was an anomaly thus 500 + program increased a numer of births rapidly . 
  ( tl ; dr for nonpoles - a year ago our goverment introduced 500 plus program where you get 500 zloty/month for every second and next child you have ) this 10 % is only data from public hospitals , we are still waiting for full information about it , noone knows how bigger will it get . 
  http://m.money.pl/wiadomosci/artykul/efekt-500-wzrost-narodzin-elzbieta-rafalska,253,0,2280957.html the question is was this 10 % + worth 20 bilion zloty a year ? 
  well , and i thought not seeing an irony in my post would be impossible , and then here you are, 
  we [ hate ] ( http://wroclawuncut.com/2016/01/04/foreign-minister-in-cyclists-vegetarians-slur/ ) vegans and cyclists here . 
  was it ? 
  well and other countries are integrating for the same reason , because it suits them, 
  eee not really, 
  not really , your point doesnt stand since even kaczynski respects freedom of press . 
  and i have proven it above , the methodology is on their website . 
  it was not a little exaggeration it was a false statement . 
  w-what ? 
  we have a pretty [ free media ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/fotp_2016_centerspreadmap_final_no_labels_740px.jpg ) . 
  there was no modification to any bill concerning press afaik . 
  if you want to start a newspaper in poland you are free to do it . 
  ok . just what values are we talking about ? 
  he is all for eu army, 
  sure thing , you always, 
  trust fund for africa and terrorism solutions those are 2 things which come to my mind . 
  of course i am not mentioning attempts to bring other states ( like ukraine and bielarus ) closer to eu . 
   poland  f.e. 
  first in line for eu army  rebels can we at least agre to call us pirates ? 
  i bought a hook and an eye patch already : /, 
  well i thought posting it would be informative , since it shows the polish perception of eu and germany . 
  this show is n't anythings special , few comedians thought it would be nice to make a series about a person who rules poland ( [ jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/26591/wp_zel_jaroslaw_kaczynski_usmiech_388.jpeg ) , chairman of our govermental party , the guy sitting ) . 
  kaczy\u0144ski is said to be making the most important decissions about poland from his small/let 's call it old school office . 
  - the guy jumping around kaczy\u0144ski is [ one of polish ministers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mariusz_b%c5%82aszczak ) . 
  - intro : the cat - kaczy\u0144ski does n't have a wife , but he had a cat which died few years back , but jokes about it remained - two swords joke -  the grunwald swords ( polish : miecze grunwaldzkie ) were a gift presented by ulrich von jungingen , the ** grand master of the order of teutonic knights , to king w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii jagie\u0142\u0142o of poland and grand duke vytautas the great of lithuania on 15 july 1410 , just before the battle of grunwald ( tannenberg ) ** . 
  the gift , a pair of simple bare swords , was a formal invitation to the battle . 
  after the polish-lithuanian victory , both swords were taken as a war trophy by king w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii to krak\u00f3w , poland 's capital at the time , and placed in the treasury of the royal wawel castle . 
  - the couple in 3:01 is our [ presidental couple ] ( http://i.iplsc.com/prezydent-andrzej-duda-z-malzonka/0004r501o7vti56e-c122-f4.jpg ) , the first lady was a german teacher . 
  - the lady in 6:48 is krystyna paw\u0142owicz , who is famous from hardcore catholic beliefs , being aggresive on facebbok and tweeter and [ eating salad ] ( http://r-http-31.dcs.redcdn.pl/http/o2/tvn/web-content/m/p1/i/80a8155eb153025ea1d513d0b2c4b675/fb9015da-8671-11e4-8272-0025b511226e.jpg ) in parliment . 
  this is low budget series but pretty popular since our govermental party is percieved with mixed emotions . 
   ( and germany does n't make the top 10 ) is this latvian revenge for potato jokes ? 
  well barbara might indicate she is a female of course  yes yes , sorry i just woke up . 
  also it is interesting how they mashed law and justice party into the artcile , i didnt know they are disliked enough to be put in random places . 
   a prominent polish historian mmm ok ? 
  who is she again ? 
  what about this idea of legeal abortion , i thought it was dicussed in denmark . 
  it works more less like this : woman has a right to abort uptil 12th week and father can legally reject a right to a child ( along with alimonies ) which will grow from the embrio uptil for example 8th week . 
  so the mother can decide if she wants to become a single mother . 
  the idea is to give a father a say in mutual child . 
  now is not the time everyone go home, 
  the highest of energies, 
  nah , europe doesnt care about saudi oil , usa does, 
   pm_me_ur_ricecooker 2017 people still fall for rice cookers when will this meme end, 
  yup  ( half of poles here , hate this country , do n't mind them ), 
   thanks , poland just hand him back after those 2,5 years , we have a situation here and we require his presence . 
  also , i am glad eu voiced a support for netherlands , this is what eu is for . 
  yup , afaik 3 years ago he knew only polish and german , i bet his english without a paper is n't good enough to speak more less freely, 
  it was one of many , google turko-kurdish riots in germany for example . 
  your statement is sexist towards man also  2017  caring about upvotes, 
  similar thing for poles and catholic church ( seen as institution ) . 
  marshall plan also allowed europe to access american market and tech, 
  i have nothing against preserving culture , in my first post i said it is just interesting , but i do have issiue with it when it ends up in unlawful acts . 
  no matter if they are commited by poles , turks , brits or whoever . 
  a part of assimilation is a compliance with laws . 
   when the polish guy got stabbed , there were marches in england with poland flags and etc yes they were , but they were allowed by the british law , here we see deporation of turkish mp who tried to transfer political issues in turkey onto other country and riots by turkish people . 
   problems like being unwanted by the natives of the land ( the english ) and getting stabbed by the right-wing english nationalists . 
   being asked to `` go back to their homeland '' in public arguments every now and then . 
   stickers put on their cars `` polish vermin '' following brexit . 
  ok , how is it polish fault ? 
  those are commited by native brits . 
  we are talking about turkish people doing riots on foregin soil . 
  [ i edited previous comment a minute after your reply , sorry for this the site did not reload on time ], 
   poles in england are running into similar problems problems like illegal gatherings of poles when meanwhile polish mp is being deported which ends up in polish riots against the country poles live in and arrest of 12 people ? 
  could you point of the date when this happened , i must have skipped it . 
  i am not saying poles are cristal clear , but the scale of those happenings are uncomparable . 
  what is more , there are numerous things like this , example turko-kurdish fights on german soil , which happen from time to time . 
  i am not saying it is good or bad just pointed out the scope of assimilation . 
  you wanted to point out a number of citizens in the west , i jus followed your logic . 
  ok , there are few milion poles in the west + we have a really shitty gov right now , still i have never heard of situation like this with us . 
  i have never heard of situation like this with greeks, 
  being serious for a moment . 
  it is interesting how 2nd nd 3rd generation of turks living in netherlands are still more turkish than dutch . 
  of course not , why should we, 
  well it looks like he made a good decission and he is happy about it, 
  i blame islam based middle eastern culture for abnormal violence and being prone to terror,
