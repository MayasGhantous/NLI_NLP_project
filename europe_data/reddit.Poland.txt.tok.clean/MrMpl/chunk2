   scenario 2 : putin not re-elected , russia becomes a normal country ** again ** . 
  russia was never normal country . 
   portuguese football team lost at the first qualifier in a humiliating defeat against albania how is that even possible ? 
  like world cup was n't enough for you guys . 
   it look like the government is getting ready for wwiii . 
  it looks more like dick waving contest . 
  showing icbms to remind people that russia is still somehow relevant . 
  stuff like that was happening all the time during cold war . 
  i also would n't say that destabilizing nuclear power seems like a good idea but whatever . 
  bigos is just not bigos when not left for a cold night outside ( preferably in freezing temperatures ) . 
  what can i say . 
  no no no we do n't eat bigos until late october . 
  now it 's beggining of mushrooms time . 
   merely a year after it had invaded democratic georgia if i remember correctly whole conflict started because georgians invaded south osettia after it proclaimed independence . 
  but hey , putin is literally hitler , right ? 
  bela ** russian **, 
  let 's go on a war with nuclear power !, 
  we will be back home before christmas !, 
  you have to remember that `` officialy '' there are no russians here . 
  of course no one believes that but would you launch nuclear missles in the direction of moscow because your eastern territory is controlled by insurgents ( who are obviously supported by russia of course ) ? 
  you see , nuclear weapons are serious business . 
  you do n't use them because some russians tanks are shooting at your army . 
  sure , nukes are powerful detterment from foreign agression but ukrainian conflict is more complicated than one country invading another to steal their land for example . 
  and you also have to remember that those nuclear weapons were part of soviet arsenal so i assume they were under russian command . 
  of course ukraine could scrap them and make their own weapons but those things are expensive and not everyone is allowed to have one . 
  but ... but i wanted to see kaliningrad ... 
  but whatever , i do n't think that we should take world cup from russians because of political reasons . 
  if someone should get their world cup taken away it 's qatar . 
   if this continues - the rebels will eventually attack kiev , which wo n't have any way of defending itself , resulting in ukraine ( or , then - novorussia ) becoming a fully russian controlled state i doubt that . 
  touching kiev would be too much , even for putler . 
  what will probably happen is forming of so called novrossija which would contain east-south of ukraine and south-west . 
  i think about kharkiv-donetsk-mariupol area . 
  if things will go worse ( and they probably will ) we may see even zaporizhia and odessa as part of russia . 
  there is no point in going farther west because nato is not a joke ( even though putin may say it is , he is probably doing it for internal support ) and unlike east , western part of ukraine is mainly pro-western . 
   i want to remind you that russia is one of the leading nuclear powers that 's funny part . 
  at what point a country becomes `` leading '' nuclear power ? 
  it does n't matter if you have 100 warheads or 4000 . 
  final outcome will be always the same . 
  did n't happen in iraq if i recall correctly . 
  im not trying to blame west here while turning blind eye on ruskies but you get the point . 
  ukrainian soldiers were taken as pows before by rebels . 
  since insurgents are n't under command of any country ( you know , officially ) , those acts were more of kidnappings . 
  ukrainians will be probably taken into rebel/russia controlled territory and held there as was happening now . 
  [ specially for you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e9cjxwi.png ) . 
  the best i could . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ tried !, 
  i was thinking about diploma . 
  what do you think ? 
  to get special throphy you would need to land in top10 . 
  your comment was n't that afwul . 
  honorable place in / r/europe hall of shame . 
  the only possible target i can imagine in near future is moldavia . 
  russia invaded ukraine mostly because their puppet goverment here was overthrown . 
  now that ukraine joining nato in next 5-10 years is very unlikely i do n't think that putin has more to gain there . 
  maybe he will try to annex so called donetsk republic as part of russian federation . 
  i said few months ago that russians wo n't go past dniepr and i still stand by this . 
  of course it does n't mean that we should n't be alerted but spreading fear is unnecessary . 
  yes , turn russia into shithole over eastern ukraine so they can isolate even more . 
  worked great for germany after wwi . 
  it was n't started over ukraine , it only escalated . 
  well , those masses are russian people completely ignoring what their government is doing that / u/tovarish _ petrov was talking about . 
   who do they think they are fooling ? 
  do they know the internet exists and soviet propaganda does n't work ? 
  it 's not targeted at west . 
  it works perfectly fine in russia . 
  just look at goverment support statistics there . 
  do n't start with those imaginary borders again . 
  what do you want , another iron courtine ? 
  borders does n't exist for no reason . 
  they show when does one goverment sphere of influence/controll end . 
  i would n't call them terrorists , you are right . 
  they do n't really meet the definition of terrorism . 
  i would call them bunch of thgus and dickheads mostly fighting because kremlin ordered them so though . 
  i do n't really see how glorious republic of donetsk would benefit from being part of russian federation but that 's subject of another post . 
  that 's one thing and i kinda agree with it ( not 100 % of course because this act was more of a symbol than simple vandalism , like those bulgarians painting red army monuments ) . 
  if he would get a small fine , hell , maybe even 3 months in jail for trespassing . 
  but he will get much harsher sentence of course . 
  and now whole case changed into politics . 
   nobody who subscribes to a backward , barbaric politicoreligious ideology like islam can be trusted . 
  you can say the same about fundamental christians really . 
  islam has it problems and im well aware of it . 
  closing borders is not how we should deal with them though . 
  educate people , do n't isolate them in ghettos , do n't let them live from welfare only ( so they have some reason to find job instead of only sitting in home and isolating themselves from society even more ) that 's how we should deal with extremists . 
  i think it 's more like regional identity ( culture , history , language ) . 
  in poland it 's quite strong in pomerania and silesia . 
  other than that , not so much . 
  you know what ? 
  im afraid that they did n't need to hire anyone . 
  tell bullshit to people long enough and they will start to spread it themselves . 
  our glorious nationalists does n't really behave better . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yu0csno.jpg ) it is in 2013 . 
   more than a ** couple ** nations couple would mean two or three . 
  i possibly misunderstood something , my bad then . 
  there is esa , there is jaxa , there is nasa , there is cnsa ( although i doubt that chinese would be willing to cooperate with west on bigger scale ) . 
  and if you really really do n't want to work with russians ( i really do n't understand why , they are acting like a dicks for 5 centuries now and because putin is threating ukraine again you want to throw soyuz away ) there is always isro making small steps ahead . 
  downplaying whole world space industry to us vs ru is huuuuge oversimplification . 
  you heard about rosetta ? 
  that probe that will drop lander on p67 asteroid somewhere in november ? 
  that 's esa . 
  i would n't say so , do n't tell me that no one has heared about laika , sputnik or gagarin .
