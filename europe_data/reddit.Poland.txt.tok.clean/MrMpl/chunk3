  i would n't say so . 
  the more we as a humanity cooperate in space exploration , the better . 
  all russians did now is refused to support costly maintance of 20 years space station ( mostly because they are planning to build their own one ) . 
  it 's nothing new . 
  hell , bush administration did n't want to maintain iss longer then after 2016 because of how expensive it is . 
  i wonder if some of this equipment remembers mir . 
  come on . 
  he did n't say that you should all go to hell . 
  i live in poland and i like you guys very much but i do n't think that russian invasion on baltics would result in open war . 
  no one would want to take the risk . 
  once nato and russia are in open conflict it 's only matter of time imo until we see nukes being used ( and by open conflict i mean nato under moscow because russian conventional forces are weak compared even to eu ones ) . 
  not that russians would dare to touch any of nato members ( not under current russian leadership at least ) of course but what if ? 
  is whole alliance worth it ? 
  would west sacrifice baltics for peace ? 
  i have no idea . 
  but if you ask me i do n't think that west would declare war to russia until tanks are crossing oder . 
  i took it in late june . 
  it looks almost the same now , except everything is a bit less green . 
  i wo n't take a new one because it 's dark already , sorry !, 
  great !, 
  another reason to bring back soviet style ~ ~ opression ~ ~ regulations to improve lifes of majority !, 
  just think how nice world would be if goverment could control everything ? 
  ^ ^ ^ plz ^ ^ ^ no, 
  so like last year ? 
  the circle of ~ ~ life ~ ~ hipocrisy . 
  thread is about keeping polish landscape clean ? 
  quickly !, 
  bash immigrants !, 
  it did n't happen for the last 40 years so i do n't see a problem really . 
  it 's not discussion , it 's spamming links about the same topic 24/7 . 
  someone says something in news and you got 5 different reports about that on front page , each with few dozens comments arguing about the same fucking thing for months . 
  is this / r/europe you want ? 
  it gets lot of hate but personally i enjoyed it much more than interstellar for example . 
  it went to shit the moment it went default for new accounts with european ip . 
  before it was full of leftists and now it seems like dominated by right wingers . 
  there is simply not enough people in between . 
  they had lunar [ rovers ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lunokhod_program ) program in 70 's if that counts . 
  why do you think they have to be paid ? 
  i assume that situation in estonia is simmilar to one in poland . 
  lot of people have rather extreme views on this situation . 
  hundreds of thousands of mostly young poles who support radical views of far right are not paid to shitpost on social medis and take part in marches . 
  they are not paid to make memes and videos promoting their cause ( looking at you korwin ) . 
  they may be a radical minority but they are the most vocal about everything . 
  im not sure what you are trying to achieve by dismissing all those action as simple internet trolls . 
  ignoring extremists rarely ends well . 
  i somehow agree with you but football was always mixed with politics . 
  take polish [ solidarity movement relation with lechia gda\u0144sk ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/43/265/artykul/1318399,rewolucja-na-stadionach-kibice-w-walce-o-wolnosc ) or [ catalonian identity strongly connected to fc barcelona ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shawn-moksvold/politicized-force-of-fc-b_b_7931466.html ) as two of many examples . 
   quatar , dubai , sa or even iran are literally across the street from syria and have the same culture so integration would be seamless . 
  they are also fairly rich countries , richer than many of the european countries who are not asked to take in refugees . 
  yet the migrants do n't go there . 
  i get your point but according to [ this article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/sep/26/qatar-migrants-how-changed-the-country ) `` immigrants make up an astounding 94 % of qatar 's workforce , and 70 % of it 's total population [ ... ] most migrants came from india and pakistan . '', 
  it 's not like only europe deals with immigrants . 
  simmilar numbers can be used to describe dubai ; and saudi arabia ... let 's not talk about it , it 's a silly place . 
  people in / r/europe wo n't like it because it 's not secure . 
  i use it myself to store photos from my phone but i understand why someone would prefer better encrypted service with servers based in europe rather than us . 
  sounds interesting . 
  i wonder what cargo does it carry considering that there were many priceless artifcats looted from silesia . 
  maybe it 's a legendary train from ksi\u0105\u017c castle  are there any photos of it available somewhere ? 
  newest ? 
  t-90a is in service since 2004 . 
  or is it `` newest '' as not yet seen there ? 
  either way , russia military involvement in this whole mess is pretty clear since crimea was annexed, 
  it seems like poorly copied album about bulgaria with ( according to some comments here ) mistakes in description . 
  it would be nice to have some official / r/europe database or proper travel guide for every country but it would take a lot of work and im way too lazy to do that . 
  let 's make another 27 same threads because someone had a good idea once . 
   it 's not complicated for the native speakers . 
  well ... 
  read theology as technology . 
  intelligent design sure seemed more interesting for a short while . 
  i was ready to congratulate danes for finally switching to lego as main building resource . 
  oh no , not again !, 
   in america there is n't much to see . 
  i have a feeling that someone will be very dissapointed with their trip to old continent . 
  yeah . 
  it has this corporate vibe . 
  i like it but i think it would match middle eastern country better . 
  emirates maybe ? 
  also , bears are super cool . 
  if i recall correctly they almost dealt with rebels in august , and then somehow rebels got reinforcments and weapons from russia . 
  that 's why this conflict wo n't end quickly . 
  no matter what ukrainians do ( although not very competent , they still have bigger manpower than simple rebels trying to secede ) , russia can always send more people into a region ( like chechens or other mercenaries ) . 
  guys !, 
  we are going back to the 80 's !, 
  oh boy , last time i was there ( few months ago ) it was afwul but now it looks at least 20 times worse . 
  so many people feeling a need to whitewash their country while trying to find enemies everywhere . 
  for an outsider both of you look like those guys from balkans insulting each other on every possible occasion . 
  just saying . 
   russia has never spied on poland you sure about that ? 
  wsi ( like cia but a bit poorer ) was infiltrated by russians , which in part lead to it 's disbanding . 
  edit : fixed spelling ^ ^ i ^ ^ was ^ ^ tired , ^ ^ ok ? 
  when was last time i have seen tesco ? 
  almost all of them have been remade into carrefour or auchan . 
  so called allied states ? 
  im sorry , i almost forgot about us spying on washington . 
  that was first gulf war . 
  there is something fascinating about russian countryside . 
  beautiful photos and really interesting story . 
  had elections happened one year earlier , crisis in ukraine would probably play much bigger role . 
  but 2 weeks ago ? 
  it 's seen as a frozen conflict .
