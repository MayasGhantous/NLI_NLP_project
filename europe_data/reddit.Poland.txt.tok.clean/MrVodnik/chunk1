europe as a whole - yes , without any problem . 
  but this will not happen . 
  europe is a joke , everyone works for themselves . 
  putin will buy some countries , scare the others and then start taking one after another ... while the remaining ones will decide that this is not their issue ( vide crimea ) . 
  eastern/central europe has to start working together much tighter right now . 
  for its own sake . 
  just responding , as a pole , that independence is ( or should be ) very important value for every nation . 
  if you do n't want to leave uk - cool , but if most of scots do , then - `` go get 'em , scotland ! '' . 
  i will not calculate economical nor political pros and cons . 
  this it to be made by them ( you ) . 
  i am just here to support nations that claims their rights . 
  i love my country , i hate pis , i hate this dude . 
  please , take him from us . 
  we can pay you . 
  there so much more wrong with him , but just because i should n't say bad things about your `` family '' , i will try to say no more . 
  but srlsy , please , we cane trade him for any other eu politician anyone can give us . 
  we have some issues with germans getting too much power over europe . 
  you know ... history . 
  you mean new land in german federation - sudetenland ? 
  well , if they really want this , we 'll try to stay out of it ... 
  yeap , we are working on that !, 
  / / btw . 
  i see what you did here ... 
  but even if all of the countries in the region were to join and form intermarium , czehia for some reason would stay out of it . 
  czehia , by definition , is a country without any access to any sea , 
  i wish we had a shared border once again , so we could party more !, 
  ( tho nothing against you , slovakia ! ), 
  exact translation of eng . 
  mente is pol . 
  `` umys\u0142 '' , which i believe is the closes it both meaning and etymology to these ( from praslav : um\u044a ) . 
  `` pamie\u0107 '' means memory , and has the same root , but imho it is not as close as `` umys\u0142 '' . 
  polish : w ** moi ** ch my\u015blach , ( ** ja ** ) ** zna ** \u0142em ** setk ** i ** now ** ych ** noc ** y. 
  `` my\u015blach '' ( thoughts , singular : `` my\u015bl '' ) could also be `` umys\u0142 '' ( mind ) , but i think that this sounds more similar . 
  remove borders , then remove some people , then ... yeap , that 's the way it goes every time !, 
  not anymore . 
  we 've sold them to china , and now they 're just another west asian country . 
  very fragile . 
  they have to stand in line , we are going for it first !, 
  i ca n't imagine a healthy democracy where there is an important government organ , that the people have completely no control over . 
  how in that scenario would you deal with corrupted supreme court ? 
  being a judge would mean being free to do whatever you want with no respect for the law . 
  as long as you are covered by the rest of the cast , of course . 
  even in case a scandal , all the people can do , is just protest for a week and the forget . 
  there is no election , and the next high judges are selected from the list prepared by the ... existing judges . 
  one hand washes the other . 
  to all of you saying that this is a partial victory because he did n't veto the third reform : most of poles consider the judiciary reform a necessary thing . 
  it is widely known , that their ( judges ) cast is corrupted and outside of peoples 's control . 
  the problem was that pis tried to use this situation and social moods to pass very controversial bill that would grant them almost total power . 
  now , while that is out of the picture , we can carry on with rest of the reforms . 
  this time , the people will watch their hands more closely . 
  this is china showing their growing strength . 
  they do n't care much about europe and russia , it is just to show off usa . 
  if washington can maintain their fleet as far as in south chinese sea , so can china send their navy to remote places . 
  those are just first steps , but more will follow . 
  chine will soon claim their part of the world and their share in global trade and commerce . 
  this is a challenge for eu as well . 
  last half a century , it relayed on the world order maintained by the states . 
  nowadays , the us has enough of its own financial and political problems which will not go away . 
  european countries need to take part of responsibilities from america ( as a western world leader ) or start adapting to the new world order . 
  in both cases , europe needs to military-up itself . 
  drugs are bad ... mkay ... dictatorship is also bad , m ` kay ? 
  i am pretty sure , that turks would 've already `` fixed '' the problem , if they would n't jailed every time someone criticize the government . 
  so , came here , organize an opposition , gather funds , and do a little purging on your political scene . 
  edit : and then we 'll do it other way around ... 
  you can almost see the todo mark left in there by the author ... 
  every day there is more and more division between east and west in europe . 
  maybe we should rebuild berlin wall and just leave each other alone as in good old times ... ? 
  sorry dude , they are ours . 
  hombre , it is a joke . 
  and germany is right . 
  he will . 
  but not because he just came with this idea , but because of the timing . 
  europe is not a unified body , the west and the east are different in so many ways . 
  the culture , the economy , the history and the military threats are very much similar for all the eastern countries and yet so different from the westerners . 
  you can see this on reddit as well . 
  in both comments and the ( often exaggerated ) maps . 
  easter block just played along because it had to , which is not the case anymore . 
  after collapse of ussr all the ex-member nations were weak and fearful for their independence . 
  they seek help in the natural opposition of ussr , which is the west . 
  now , almost 30 years later , we feel as we finally have another options . 
  and we seek to explore them . 
  trump is just one of many catalysts . 
  i hope i do n't get banned from here for this , but ... this dude is not that bad . 
  belarus is not france , taking into consideration their geopolitical situation they came up quite good ( vide their southern neighbor ) . 
  edit : typos, 
  oh , i am sorry , but i do n't think you 've got my point ... as sarcastic as it was . 
  probably should 've used / s marker . 
  i was referring to : http://www.businessinsider.com/scotland-could-vote-to-leave-the-uk-within-the-next-2-years-2016-6?op=1&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t&amp;ir=t edit : which of course adds more borders for the ( u ? 
  well , maybe those are just spoilers ? 
  / s which does n't change much for me . 
  the map looks more or less the same in every source you could check : https://duckduckgo.com/?q=terrorist+attakcs+in+eu+map&amp;t=canonical&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=https%3a%2f%2fpbs.twimg.com%2fmedia%2fc-qqp3ow0aalhzd.jpg, 
   the most affecte country will probably be ireland , or scotland ... ... just saying  they have the only land border with the uk and there is a history of tension . 
  there is also spain ( bordering gibraltar ) , with not much less history of tensions . 
  for those who do not know capslockish language , the title is : `` eu and ukraine celebrate closer ties in kiev '' you 're welcome !, 
  yeap , could n't wait for it any longer !, 
  my take on this issue : `` ethnic people '' are people identifying themselves as of any ethnicity ... ie those , who hold any ** identity ** . 
  which as we know , is not so common in the west countries . 
  yeah , we do . 
  but still , it is quite often , that we feel left out on so many modern maps ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4brazv/map_of_terrorist_attacks_in_europe_after_911/,
