i speak polish , english and some swedish as i started learning it this year . 
  i know some russian and spanish from school ( i think i would be able to order a beer ) and in high school i had three years of latin , which sometimes really hurts more than helps when studying other languages . 
  more generally , the most popular second language that students learn here is definitely english , after that probably german , french and spanish . 
  well , barring the rare exceptions like these , where text just is n't translable , in my opinion old infinity engine games like baldur 's gate , planescape torment etc. , actually had great , possibly unmatched to this day translations , with professional actors providing 1st grade dubbing and lots of wit in the dialogues ( and i say that even though i play all modern games in english ), 
  i used to work as a game programmer for a time , video games are love , video games are life . 
  nowadays i mostly play the productions from the paradox development studio , lately i also completed the shadowrun returns : hong kong and tales from the borderlands . 
  i wish it had a linux port , i really hope for the victoria 3 on the new version of clausewitz engine, 
  roguelikes are awesome , i lost hundreds of hours playing nethack, 
  for their cars ? 
   i know i ca n't do it in poland under those grounds , and definitely not in germany . 
  does someone know if their country allows other eu citizens to come , get the name changed , and go back ? 
  as in going back to germany , or going back to poland ? 
  i can not answer for the first one , but in poland this action would not be acknowledged at all , as polish citizen is seen to be a subject only to the polish law and such administrative decisions from other countries would not apply to them ( which means that in practice you would have two different names in the two countries ) . 
  i like many [ mars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mars,_incorporated ) brands , i do not think that i have ever tasted any american sweets that were n't made by them though . 
  in poland we do the same , although in my experience it also depends on how many people are in the waiting room, 
  i am a bit biased because i live here , but [ cracow ] ( http://www.krakowexperience4you.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/krakow-1599x822.jpg ) is a great place to visit, 
  i do n't think that you can see the high proliferation of traditional dresses in the everyday use anywhere in europe , as they are usually considered to be rather decorative/festive then practical . 
  that said , in the polish rural areas many people dress up during the major catholic holidays , especially the corpus christi which usually takes place in the late spring . 
  i remember how in mid 2000s i went on a car trip to balkans and a family member insisted on taking a shortcut that he swore that he had found on his map . 
  we drove to a rusty sign informing us that we are in the mine field . 
  good times , drove back slowly and on reverse . 
  [ slovak paradise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak_paradise ) in the tatra mountains , fantastic place for hiking . 
  to pursue the master 's degree in poland you must have the bachelor 's degree , or roughly equivalent engineer 's degree . 
  except the required gpa usually there is not a strict prerequisite about the discipline , although sometimes it is required that it belongs to the same family as the master 's degree , like the humanities or natural sciences . 
  there are mba studies in english here ( different then the standard management major ) , but at least at my uni they are somewhat frown upon and that degree is perceived as something that you could at best hang on wall after paying a lot of money nonetheless . 
  i am not really sure how things exactly are nowadays before tertiary education ( every few years there is an educational reform and another one was passed just yesterday ) , but overall i like our educational system and i do n't think that i would really change much now . 
  i am happy that i could get my degree without paying a dime and about what i brought from my time in school too . 
  it is the same in polish too , both castle and lock are spelled `` zamek '' ( there is no difference in pronunciation ) . 
  while i am not really fond of this multiple union idea , for a start i would not cluster us based only on an ancient geographical nomenclature . 
  to provide some level of cultural similiarity ( and geographical proximity ) , i think it would be sensible to distinguish the central slavic group for example . 
   i do n't think that would work , because the cultures differ too much ( ... )  * germanic eu ( germany , ** poland ** , the netherlands etc. ), 
  huh . 
  i deem it very likely that it would be exactly what would happen . 
  as you can see in the link , a few parties with less then 10k votes got their representative in the parliament . 
  even now there are fringe parties that possess much greater support . 
   now some parties are established enough that they wo n't be going away anyway and what happened to most of the parties that belonged to once all powerful aws ? 
  that is a bold statement . 
  if there are reasons why you do n't think it would be a good idea to magically change the current system to stv because of some nice qualities of d'hondt it is ok , otherwise i really do n't see your point , as we are just discussing hypotheticals . 
  although just removing the threshold would be better then the current situation for this reason ( lots of votes possibly going to waste resulting either in the `` vote for the lesser evil '' rhetoric , or voters just staying at home when they are disillusioned about the chances of their preferred parties to pass threshold by polls ) , i do n't see much value in introducing tens of fringe parties into the parlament , like it happened during the [ elections in 1991 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliamentary_election,_1991 ) when the threshold was not yet established . 
  i would introduce the preferential voting system with [ single transferable vote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_transferable_vote ) for our parliamentary elections . 
  median salaries for the graduates of the presumably best polish business school and the best technical university amount to , respectively , 8700 pln ( ~ 2080 $ ) and 7700 pln ( ~ 1840 $ ) . 
  of course it does n't really say much without knowing the purchasing power of local money - it is worth viewing something like the [ big mac index ] ( http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index ) first . 
  it is impossible to answer a question like this without stating first in which field of study one graduates in . 
  it will be much different between , say , liberal arts and engineering . 
  i know quite a few programmers for example who just got out of the university and are paid much more then most of the people get after 20-30 years of work experience . 
  [ extra credits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/extracreditz ) - amazing edutainment channel about video game theory and many ideas of game studies . 
  for some time they also share interesting videos about world history / [ extra history ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhykya0yj_5bunvhot8ls82cr20yo6y_p ) [ kurzgesagt - in a nutshell ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/kurzgesagt ) - educational videos explaining many interesting topics , from stock markets to crispr , with narration over silly , high quality animations, 
   the great war i love that one , very engaging and in depth telling of the i ww , i also like its partner channel [ it 's history ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucziz8hrzdgc-pnqdug6avba ), 
  [ yeah , i have read that one before ... ] ( http://www.snopes.com/college/pranks/livestock.asp ), 
   one of a few good memories from 1st grade . 
  nothing beats some good old schadenfreude !, 
  it did n't happen to me personally , but a few months ago in a place not far away from my hometown , a few high junior school students were questioned by the police and as far as i know , brought to family court for spitting out communion after the mass . 
  fair enough , 
  we were in the capital city of the subcarpathian voivodeship / [ rzesz\u00f3w ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/rzeszow/ ), 
  where do you live ? 
  i do n't come to churches often , but was quite surprised when visiting my relatives in the traditionally religious eastern poland ( subcarpathia ) , that the church only had about 2/3 seats taken during the main mass on christmas . 
  i do n't get how the video you posted in description refers to your query in the matter of supporting intra-eu migration . 
  there are economical differences between our countries , but it is nonsensical to support the immigration from , say , bulgaria to luxembourg ( countries with respectively the lowest and highest gdp per capita in eu ) for humanitarian reasons . 
  ignoring the description , i would say that most of the people here are just neutral about intra-eu migration , neither supporting nor hostile to it in any way . 
  i would consider the support of developing-world immigration to europe as definitely fringe , to be honest i have never actually heard anyone propose it here . 
  well , [ epic sax guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkmncrapilw ) ( from 2010 moldovan performance ) is kind of drilled into my head by now, 
  except last issues with our most benevolent supreme leader jesus , the [ teletubbies tinky winky controversy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teletubbies#reception ) comes to my mind ( there were steps taken to launch an official investigation to determine if he is homosexual ), 
  no , but i always obtain a pack of sparklers for this occasion . 
  you can buy fireworks without any problems in poland , it is their usage that is limited and requires special permission ( except the easter , the last and the first day of the year ) . 
  i agree and the biggest problem to me seems to be with the usage of `` the '' - lots of exceptions and little rules about if and when it is applied to proper names . 
   finnish school teachers are educated at university whereas that is not the case in the other countries . 
  where the school teachers are educated in the other nordic countries ? 
  they do n't need the higher/university education ? 
  * i have never heard one say the word `` lorry '' , i use `` truck '' exclusively * no preference between apartment and flat , i use both terms interchangeably * i almost always say `` for rent '' , except when discussing the idea of * sub * letting something, 
  i know a few people who use quora here ( at least passively ) and to be honest its audience does not give me a vibe of being usa centric , but indian centric . 
  history and philosophy, 
  physical education and polish , never-ending poetry analysis bored me to hell . 
  i was just about to post it myself , i love her videos so much [ face slapping wake-up machine ftw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxlzfahl4-k ), 
  same here , my mom likes her works very much and i have a big shelf in my room dedicated only to her books . 
  strange thing is , to my knowledge none of her books were translated to english ( while being quite popular in the ex eastern block countries ), 
  poland : [ joanna chmielewska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joanna_chmielewska ) , mostly notable for her crime fiction . 
  as for the whole of europe , it would be a toss-up between [ terry pratchett ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terry_pratchett ) and [ douglas adams ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/douglas_adams ) . 
  twice a year , one of which is an obligatory trip to slovakia to ski or to hike in the mountains . 
  i think that [ safran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/safran ) is probably the biggest european company which pursues r&d work in that field . 
   all that does n't matter on the left/right divide . 
  the left/right scale is only economic . 
  if you believe that you are bound to be misunderstood by many people when discussing politics . 
  left and right are usually considered to be amalgamates of respectively `` economically illiberal/socially liberal '' and `` economically liberal/socially traditionalist '' policies ( and lots of woes comes from this oversimplified division ) . 
  i would take into the consideration some of the right-wing populist parties , it is just that the pis/polish ruling party , for all its traditionalist and somewhat authoritarian tendencies just is not that radical to be considered far right in my opinion . 
  i take it as a rule to never consider seriously polls conducted by cbos ( which is not only funded from the government budget , but has its representatives in its council ) if you are referring to something published by them . 
  while i try not to mix reality with the wishful thinking , i do n't really see signals that would make me believe that razem will fare worse then as in the last elections at least . 
  i think that is a huge overestimation , just in the last elections left got about 10-12 % of the votes . 
  personally i do not consider sld to really be a left-wing party in anything but its name , but it was seen as a lesser evil by many people and other parties in its voting block definitely are . 
  social democrat razem ( `` together '' ) , barely known to the public at the time of the elections got over 3.5 % of the votes itself . 
  the other answers mainly relate to the far right parties and so does this one . 
  most of the parties in the polish parlament represent either the right-wing populism ( like the ruling party ) or the centre-right ; somewhat conservative with a more liberal economic agenda . 
  far right here has a few seats at most . 
  at least in my experience most of the people here are very much in support of the israel , even those who otherwise express anti-semitic views , if only by seeing them as a `` vanguard against muslims '' who are perceived by many as a more homogeneous group then they actually are . 
  yes , i would be against it . 
  i am in no condition , have no expertise and above everything else , motivation to fight and possibly die on a battlefield . 
  although in the event of war , to help in protecting my family and friends ( if they do n't flee ) from the foreign invader i would readily throw cash into something like the war fund , especially to pay for the mercenary or drone warfare if our standing army proves inadequate to fight . 
  not really , i see multiculturalism only as a step in the creation of the global , mostly unified culture . 
  i like the intermingling of fashions , cuisines , music styles et cetera , but one day i would very like there to be one , preferably socially liberal and scientifically progressive society which would share the same set of goals and values . 
  in the context of the question it is kind of a half-answer , so i would say that i am against the spread of cultures that are n't secular at least and for the stronger integration of their representatives to the mainstream if they move somewhere else where people mostly are . 
  i agree .
