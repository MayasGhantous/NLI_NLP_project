  as to its usefulness i think it is worthwhile to learn at least the cyrillic script ( if one does not already use it ) - by knowing it most of the slavic people can comprehend quite a bit of the written text , even if they do n't really know the russian language . 
   do you feel this way , too ? 
  was it a popular subject to take ? 
  also , what year are we talking about , when did you go to school ? 
  i have occasionally met such attitude too , but personally do n't think so . 
  it just is n't seen to be that useful here ( which quite possibly is wrong in the general sense , after considering english and german ) . 
  most of the students in my class somewhat begrudgingly took it , just because there was n't any alternative , it was n't an elective required to pass though . 
  i took these classes for three years about a decade ago , so the aversion was n't motivated by the recent events in the ukraine if it is that what you are asking . 
  interesting . 
  of course it depends on the school and the faculty , but in my experience english at least is taught quite well here and polish people seem to be high in the international proficiency rankings . 
  that said , i picked some russian because it was the only language among english that was taught in my rural high junior school in the eastern poland and spanish was an elective at the university that i was forced to take because i missed the registration  most of the people stick to the two languages for the entire span of their education and learn them well . 
  in poland you usually learn two foreign languages , often it is english + german , french or spanish . 
  all my friends are quite fluent in english . 
  most of them know some german as well ( i do not , at all ) . 
  personally , i speak polish and english . 
  i probably could order a beer in spanish and russian , as i had studied them without much commitment for some time when i was younger . 
  nowadays i learn swedish at the language school , mostly because i like it and the swedish culture . 
  i would not call that society strictly egalitarian , but at least in the stem fields women were much better represented then in many western countries . 
  [ soviet russia had a better record of training women in stem than america does today ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/soviet-russia-had-a-better-record-of-training-women-in-stem-than-america-does-today-180948141/ ),

  [ jewish physics !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2w6pm2/polan_and_germoneys_adventures_in_time_part_iv/ ), 
  i would n't want to erase it exactly , but if i could teleport it i would rejoin the kaliningrad oblast with the rest of the russia . 
  it is like border gore from europa universalis irl . 
  we would be neighbours , how nice !, 
  i get where you are coming from and `` culturally-christian '' may even be an ok term to use when referring to the countries which where established under the christian sphere of influence , but i find your reasoning quite wrong . 
  atheism is a lack of belief in the existence of deities . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  you could believe in reincarnation , ghosts , astral projection , elves , fairies , perform rituals , go to church out of habit and whatnot , and still be an atheist . 
  trying to impose or even imagine some standard of proper behaviour to which atheists should adhere to be considered atheists is just silly . 
  ditto that , duolingo is great to get a hang of fundamentals , memrise for vocab after learning some basics . 
  i do n't think that you would have much problems in most of the european countries , if you are going to live in one of the bigger cities at least . 
  personally i would recommend sweden , my friend studies graphic/game design there as a foreign student at the university of g\u00f6teborg and is quite happy with her decision . 
  while it is a lesser priority for you , for checking the estimated tuition rates in the european countries i would recommend this [ site ] ( https://www.studyineurope.eu/tuition-fees ) . 
  for quite a few of them you would only pay token money as an irish/eu citizen . 
  it is as valid reason as any for non-native speakers to never learn german !, 
  ( well , that and [ downfall hitler rants parodies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el76iww-iu4 ) , which probably loose quite a bit of their charm when you understand what they are really saying ) . 
  yup , it is the bread with [ smalec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lard ) ( or lard in english ) . 
  quite popular appetizer in the rustic restaurants here . 
  not really , expect maybe standing up for a moment when a teacher or the headmaster entered a class . 
  we also had non-mandatory catholic religion lessons which started and ended with a prayer . 
  atheists or not , all students in my class participated in them anyway , because it was an easy a which contributed to the gpa just as much as physics or geography . 
  i enjoyed the book , with the series it is more complicated . 
  i barely made it to the end of the first season , because while i like the overall plot and supporting characters ( especially ss obergruppenf\u00fchrer and mr. tagomi ) , i find the lead bland and boring . 
  most of their ordeal is a direct result of a very poor judgement and the abysmal ability to communicate with each other . 
  nope . 
  poland is a place where i was born , so i am polish . 
  i had as much say in the matter as in having blue eyes and being right-handed . 
  i do n't see a reason to be either ashamed or proud for coming to life here or anywhere else . 
  i care about the place where i live , because its condition influences my personal well being and that of my family , and my friends , but i feel less connected to the people of my country that i do n't personally know then to any person , even on the other side of the globe , that shares my values and interests . 
  i love them all , but the crusader kings 2 is my favourite [ `` i have the biggest castle !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecqril9mcau ), 
  and the best birdy sidekick ever , crow < 3, 
  i have nothing against cdp , i just love grand strategy games and the paradox development studio is the master of them, 
  before witcher i think that the gothic 1 & 2 were probably the most popular `` non-casual '' video games in our country , i know a few people who do n't play games almost at all and still remember locations and characters from these two . 
  ditto that , i like all of the amplitude studios games , but for a 4x strategy endless legend absolutely shines in its art & soundtrack, 
  as a person who does n't like meat , i have an incredible fortune to live in a region where you can get a lot of the cheesy/doughy goodness . 
  in poland it would probably be : [ pierogi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi ) [ kopytka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kopytka ) when visiting our czech and slovak neighbours i love eating : [ halu\u0161ky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halu%c5%a1ky ) [ vypr\u00e1\u017ean\u00fd / sma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sma%c5%been%c3%bd_s%c3%bdr ), 
  as a sci-fi fan i quite liked \u00c4kta m\u00e4nniskor , although i am still on the fence if the british adaptation is better or not ( definitely its soundtrack is ) . 
  this war of mine , but for me in europe nothing beats games from the swedish paradox interactive . 
  i love hugging my friends and usually have no problems with hugging other people i know , but i hate these fake , `` auntie kisses '' on greetings and goodbyes , they make me feel awkward . 
  [ latvian peasants jokes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/latvianjokes/ ) just a few years ago were incredibly popular in my peer group . 
  even today we sometimes randomly insert some parts of them in conversation . 
  like saying `` politbiuro much generous '' when friend got a raise in his job . 
  actually almost any attempt of trying to speak polish by foreigners is received with a great deal of amiability . 
  although it is somewhat hard to find the accent attractive when a foreigner says something like `` w szczebrzeszynie chrz\u0105szcz brzmi w trzcinie '' because you have to be constantly vigilant that they do n't choke . 
  ah , ok , i thought that was a comment about pronunciation only . 
  you are right about complicated grammar ( although in polish we even have one more grammatical case , in latin ablativus `` glues '' two of them ) . 
  to this day i vividly remember learning the suffixes of the first declension by humming them : \u266b - a - ae - ae - am - a - a \u266b \u266b - ae - arum - is - as - is - ae \u266b, 
  i had three years of latin in high school and it very much depends on what your native language is . 
  the true way that the latin was spoken is pretty much lost to us , but its modern reconstruction from traces available in modern languages presents a good approximation . 
  spanish , italian and polish people ( and many other representatives of non-germanic languages ) actually have close to zero problems with reading it . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56n1q0/federalist_sentiment_in_the_european_union_xpost/ polish and hungarian people are very much in support of federalization , current polish government admittedly is not . 
  [ \u266b what if civilization had lyrics ? 
  \u266b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al6wltdpipu ), 
  it is forbidden to defame , burn or otherwise destroy the national symbols ( flag , country emblem etc. ), 
  and in the worst case , you could even go to jail for it . 
  you can be punished for destroying the national symbols of other countries too . 
  i have n't heard about anyone being put to jail , but there were a few cases of people paying fines for doing so . 
  modern military ? 
  no , not at all . 
  soldiers of the ii ww , especially those who continued the guerilla fight after the september campaign and in the raf as pilots are commemorated on many occasions . 
  you probably meant `` composed '' not compromised , but it actually makes this answer even better . 
  that sld is/was ever considered social-democratic in anything but in its name is somewhat hilarious . 
  not really . 
  in the more general sense yes , there is a migration from ukraine ( although it has n't actually rised that much since the beginning of the conflict , `` only '' twice maybe ) , but not many seek an * asylum * in poland , among other things because it is just hard to get . 
  rather than that , most just apply for the temporary residence permit and work here . 
  [ relevant info from the beginning of the year . 
  ] ( http://www.fmreview.org/destination-europe/szczepanik-tylec.html ), 
  no migrants whatsoever , so no change . 
  on the 24th of december my family has a traditional christmas dinner together . 
  we eat some special christmas dishes , listen to carols , drink wine , share wishes of well-being in the following year and open presents which were put earlier under the christmas tree . 
  after that it is a tv time . 
  polish equivalent to the mandatory donald duck in swedish tv programme is home alone , aired in tv [ every year since 1990 . 
  ] ( http://culture.pl/en/article/home-alone-in-poland-an-unexpected-national-tradition ), 
  nope , i really hope that we shall all stay together . 
  hungary and poland where mentioned a few times in this thread as being anti-eu , but the general public in these countries actually seems to be very supportive of it . 
  some stats : http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/07/euroskepticism-beyond-brexit/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/support-for-the-eu-on-the-rise-since-brexit-vote-even-in-the-uk the matter of supporting overall eu * policies * by their governments is another thing , but poland at least made a shift in that area just a year ago , after last elections . 
  at least here `` liberal '' has two , sometimes contradictory meanings .
