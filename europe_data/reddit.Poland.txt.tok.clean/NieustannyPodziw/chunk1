  that depends : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe, 
  w-what ? 
  i ca n't do it ? 
  hold my beer !, 
  i mean ... just watch !, 
  let 's put aside how ludicrous this statement is in the big picture , and focus on a little detail in current russian policy : so russia is fighting the `` nazi junta '' in ukraine , but it 's totally ok to make a pact with the actual nazis ? 
  how do you drink from it ? 
  there 's a tap or something ? 
  you can see similar mini-gardens sometimes , but most of the graves nowadays looks more or less like this : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:henryk_de_fiumel_gr\u00f3b.jpg http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:zbigniew_resich_gr\u00f3b.jpg, 
  uhm , did you mean jew islamist lgbt nazi cia ? 
  yes , it is . 
  i can not into grammar . 
  wow , i like them . 
  much nicer imho than mostly stone graves in poland ( especially when kitsch jumps in ) . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ bet ^ ^ they 're ^ ^ muuuuuch ^ ^ cheaper . 
  it 's actually two different celebrations of \u015bmigus and dyngus , that were joined together in one over the years . 
  now actually it 's hard to tell what exactly was one and what the other originally . 
  on the other hand i 'd love slavic [ dziady ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dziady ) ( [ polish wikipedia is much more elaborate ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/dziady_ ( zwyczaj \\ ) ) if you can read it or auto translation is n't that bad ) ~ ~ not get ~ ~ was n't killed by the church .

  glory to arstotzka !, 
  amateurs !, 
  in warsaw ticket prices went up by almost 100 % in 3 years ( 2.60 z\u0142 to 4.40 z\u0142 ) . 
  and were to be raised even more this year ( to 5 . something iirc ) , but we finally lost our shit and called a referendum to overthrown the president of warsaw -- it failed eventually , but `` referendum miracles '' happened anyway . 
  fun fact : thanks to the raise , the income from ticket sells dropped .

  and i do n't speak about ukraine only . 
  putin seems to spend quite a lot of time explaining how he ( or russia ) does n't give a damn . 
  i wonder what they will tell to the citizens . 
  that they want to protect them against people who will come to oppress them ? 
  we produce enough gas by ourselves to not sell imported gas . 
  thanks , putin . 
  and why would you buy things online , rather than get them from `` alternative sources '' , if you 're already paying for them ?

  where exactly is it ? 
   critical thinking is at least partially related to certain genes it is ? 
  any source about that ? 
  it is most certainly cultural ( and we all can agree that culture of soviet russia was n't much critical thinking friendly ) , but genetic ? 
  maybe they need a pretext to invade russia ? 
   of course , this guy beat them both !,

  too much hollywood `` physics '' ? 
  aa missiles does n't work like that . 
  they do n't hit the target directly , blowing it up in a gigantic slow-motion fireball , leaving nothing but the dust . 
  thanks obama for that . 
  i 'm no longer sure if they 're serious or very , very hipster . 
  you answered wrong comment . 
  but i 'll upvote anyway , making fun out of jkm is always worth it . 
  sounds like ed wood 's so-bad-that-it 's - good movies . 
  i 'm actually interested now . 
   if russians had really bad navigation skills well , they seem to get lost over and over during recent months . 
  sure , but you would n't imagine how easy it is to get lost in here . 
  i 'm feeling i 'm loosing the fight not to make a joke how in soviet russia protection gets you . 
  they do ? 
  what a strange world . 
  except when it 's good , well polished pun . 
   if poland should have a soviet flag , then france , belgium and the netherlands should have a usa/uk/canada flag as well . 
  i did n't know usa/uk/canada installed their own government in france , belgium and netherlands , persecuted the opposition and generally treated the land as their own . 
  care to elaborate on that matter ? 
  i worded it badly : belarus and ukraine should have soviet flag , and poland should have soviet flag only ( invasion in 1944-45 ) . 
  i misunderstood your comment . 
   liberation of course it was liberation . 
  only they get carried away and later liberated poland from people opposing them , installed their own government and stayed here for next half of century , in the meantime liberating us from another opposing them people . 
   also , in the case of poland , it should technically be only the soviet flag , since the question reads ` last ' , and the soviet invasion of poland began quite a time after september 1st . 
  in 1939 soviets invaded together with germany . 
  yes , technically they attacked 17 days later , but a ) they agreed to do so in ribbentrop-molotov pact in late august , and b ) each invaded half of poland . 
  however whole poland was invaded again in 1944-45 and soviets stayed here until 1989 ( or 1992 , when last soviet soldiers left poland ) . 
  for belarus , ukraine and poland it should be soviets too . 
   shot on a shoestring budget in russia 's western exclave of kaliningrad it 's a pity they ca n't shot on the stairs in odessa . 
  guys , please post a comment whether you like maps or not and country you 're from . 
  with enough data we can make a maps perception map .

  lol , best counterargument ever, 
  they certainly are n't indo-european , but that does n't mean thaye are pre - . 
  yeah , frack those tosters . 
  do n't they ride seahorses ? 
  and polish league is supposedly among the best in the world ( at least in women 's volleyball ) . 
  [ meteora monasteries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meteora ) . 
  berlin is not where it should be as well . 
  also : russia is n't part of europe apparently . 
  i 'm sure after this statement and recent events in ukraine , russians in baltics are much more welcome now . 
  especially because with lithuania it was an union . 
  heavily dominated culturally by poland , but union none the less . 
  and as for ukraine ( and belarus ) it 's a pity that polish-lithuanian-ruthenian commonwealth did n't worked out -- united we could be a power for next few hundreds years that turned out really shitty for everyone . 
  and now just for the sake of lulz -- favourite excolony : russia . 
  and we [ almost had madagascar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonization_attempts_by_poland ) . 
  and tourists , money ... 
  thanks a lot !, 
  thanks for clarification . 
  also : what is the status of gibraltar in uk ?
