  they probably love chopin even more than we do , you can study polish in japan , there are polish festival regularly . 
  - http://www.bristol.us.edu.pl/wykladowcy_na_swiecie.php?a=2 ( polish , with pictures near the end ) - http://shichijyuuni.com/2014/12/10/polish-festival-in-roppongi-a-new-video/ few years ago i 've read a really good interview with a japanese studying polish in japan , explaining quite good why japanese are interested in poland , sadly ca n't find it now . 
   for example , poland just thanked russia for helping it 's citizens in yeman , but because r/europe is so filled with properganda , you will never know about it . 
    http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150403/1020435675.html have you tried to post that news here ? 
  i made an extensive research , can confirm : https://lornpearsontrains.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dastardly_and_muttley.jpeg, 
  i was half expecting only one enormous `` non !, 
  and long after . 
  ah , so that 's how the so called knocking looks like . 
  til !, 
  good tsar and evil boyars all over again . 
  of course crude oil is known since thousands of years , it has been used in babylon . 
  and just before your second quote :  an early commercial well was hand dug in poland in 1853 , and another in nearby romania in 1857 . 
  at around the same time the world 's first , but small , oil refineries were opened at jas\u0142o , in poland , with a larger one being opened at ploie\u0219ti , in romania , shortly after . 
  also fun fact : do n't know if it 's really true , but legend has it , that peasants approached \u0141ukasiewicz with oil , asking if it 's possible to distill spirit out of this weird flammable thing that keeps popping in the lakes in the woods . 
  actually poland has some oil . 
  in fact this is the place where kerosene lamp has been invented , and where first modern oil refinery has been built . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignacy_%c5%81ukasiewicz http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_petroleum_trail, 
  also large oil fields had been discovered over weekend . 
  i just noticed your username czechs out . 
  thanks for a laugh . 
  sounds like a reasonable plan , i 'm sure you did n't write that with a tongue in czech . 
  meanwhile russia is keeping american army in czech . 
  he looks like a good czechmate . 
  not much . 
  according to 2011 census : - 846,719 persons identify themselves as ( partly ) silesian , - 232,547 as kashubian , - 147,814 as german , - 51,001 as ukrainian , - 46,787 as belorussian , - 17,049 as romani , - 13,046 as russian , - 11,838 as american , - 10,531 as lemkos , - 10,495 as english , - and so on : http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/mniejszo\u015bci_narodowe_i_etniczne_w_polsce#narodowy_spis_powszechny_2011 ( ca n't find english source , but google translate should do ) . 
  so chance for russian green men is only slightly bigger than american or british . 
  for practical reasons either some slavic or english speaking country . 
  probably north england or scotland , because i love the accent . 
  also always wanted to go to new zealand . 
  well , you guessed right . 
   thanks for short explanation . 
  i 'm afraid you could n't truly appreciate it , because of language and cultural barriers ( still great piece of music ) , but i want you know that concept album [ powstanie warszawskie ( warsaw uprising ) by lao che ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/powstanie_warszawskie_ ( album \\ ) ) is way better . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ cried ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ bit ^ ^ ^ ^ near ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ end , ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ becomes ^ ^ ^ ^ -- just ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ uprising -- ^ ^ ^ ^ less ^ ^ ^ ^ enthusiastic ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ ^ gloomy , ^ ^ ^ ^ few ^ ^ ^ ^ first ^ ^ ^ ^ times . 
  pardon my ignorance : why no ? 
  ( genuinely ignorant and curious ) . 
  man , too soon . 
  just look at the map : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/acprussiamap2.gif yellow part was the land of polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  great part of those `` former german lands totally resettled by polish people '' were part of german partiton of kingdom of poland . 
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_partition - http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/acprussiamap2.gif, 
  meh , we can handle a couple of broomsticks . 
  yes , and resettled by people whose homeland and wealth has been taken by stalin . 
   `` we had the horrible feeling that the country that had almost become our home would no longer exist , '' said his wife ludmila . 
    `` my neighbour , who was my friend , cried for a week . 
  it was the collapse of everything - their lives , their careers . '', 
  well , fuck you and your neigbour . 
  source of the map is current ~ ~ edition ~ ~ issue of polityka magazine ( 13 ( 3002 ) , 25-03-30 .03.2015 , page 28 ) . 
  poll made by ibris . 
  because the article is not available online , i redraw it from scratch . 
  in a sense , yes . 
  but we could also blame the war on soviet union annexing ukraine . 
  something tells me he 's going to appear in snickers commercial soon . 
  edit : apparently they 're already doing pr stunts : http://metro.co.uk/2015/03/13/jeremy-clarkson-suspended-the-funniest-reaction-so-far-has-just-been-found-5102249/, 
   and lech wa\u0142\u0119sa with his airport ? 
  :  not the same thing . 
  it 's hard to me to explain it in english , but it 's not * named * after him , but he is just * a `` patron '' * of it ( lotnisko ** im . 
  i know it 's just an example , but there is an unwritten ( ? ), 
  rule to name streets , squares , etc. 
  after persons who passed away at least x years ago only . 
  the only exception was john paul ii , who had streets named after him while he was still alive . 
  invest in yourself in eastern poland . 
  [ played at double speed , he sounds like donald duck . 
  ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/'allo_'allo!#the_policeman_cometh ), 
  thanks !, 
  sadly it does n't :  `` this is a modest , affordable and simple solutions that would bring us out of the way . 
  then maybe we can stop this bloody sandkassaleik . 
  forgive the vulgarity . '', 
  if it 's good enough for gonewild , then it 's good enough for world politics . 
  i guess until putin posts a selfie with a timestamp , we should assume he 's still missing . 
   grom looks more like that is n't that [ formoza ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jw_formoza ) actually ? 
  sorry , i dropped the / s. 
  and apparently google fails at translating it . 
  because translated article does n't claim what op claims . 
  or maybe ... ? 
   yea why future date tho ? 
  he cant think that it already was 16th of monday . 
  guy who prepares text for teleprompter is n't the one who adds all the effects to video . 
  someone was lazy to check what he/she was writing about . 
  has been said to write about the meeting , wrote it in wrong tense . 
  because why would he had to write about a meeting that is about to happen ? 
  * of course it already happened * !, 
  if western media can repeatedly screw up world maps ( there actually is a [ tumblr about that ] ( http://mapfail.tumblr.com/ ) ; edit : hmpf , apparently for the first time * there is no subreddit for that * , i 'm disappoint ... ) , some russian corporate drone can screw up one news . 
  my bet is the guy who prepares text for teleprompter screwed up . 
  if russian media would want to make a fake story , they would come up with something bigger and better . 
  by now we all know they are capable to do so . 
  while it is funny in current circumstances , it 's not enough to make me put my tin foil hat . 
  also : yes , media all over the world do prepare some of their material in advance about events that are for certain happen sooner or later , for example about the death of pope or whoever . 
  why_not_both . jpg, 
   putin will stay as long as russia keeps going forward the thing is , russia is going backward for quite some time now ... 
   russian ` anti-maidan ' activists to fight western influence with voodoo is n't voodoo western influence ? 
  also , i 'm not sure what church thinks about it . 
  nope . 
   adding '' \u017ce '' makes a word , hmm , stronger ? 
  and i love it too . 
   in romania you do n't overreact , you make a stallion out of a mosquito ( `` a face din tantar armasar '' ) in poland we have similar idiom : to make a pitchfork out of a needle ( `` robi\u0107 z igly wid\u0142y '' ) . 
  other than just plain idioms , my favourite expression is `` we\u017amy zr\u00f3bcie '' . 
  it 's grammatically incorrect combination of `` we\u017amy zr\u00f3bmy '' ( `` let 's do this '' ) and `` we\u017acie zr\u00f3bcie '' ( `` you should do this '' ) that means more or less `` let 's you should do this '' ) . 
  the expression is used mostly in -- and probably originates from -- it community . 
  it 's used when a person comes up with some idea ( usually not very brilliant or realistic , but that 's not the rule ) `` that we should totally do , because it 's the best plan ever !, 
  '' , however does not shows any sign of being interested with actually working on that thing , instead is just looking for someone to step up and do exactly what he/she said . 
  also , sometimes it 's used ironically by the person who comes up with the idea .
