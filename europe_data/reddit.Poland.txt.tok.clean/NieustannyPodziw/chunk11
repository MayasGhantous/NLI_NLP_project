  i believe the most recent is a fight for a carp at lidl also , just before last christmas : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzqxkx3r_5u, 
  meh , happens in poland every now and then . 
  although i find it hard not to make a joke about people 's banana republic . 
  chantarelles are also great in scrambled eggs . 
  same in poland , reportedly ( never did that myself ) . 
  also kids at school learn this or that about mushrooms ( though this book knowledge is nowhere near practial knowledge ) . 
   it 's dangerous if you do n't know what you 're doing all it takes is to go with someone who does know mushrooms and can show a few most popular ones , and -- if there is one -- how distinguish them from similar indedible mushroom ( [ tylopilus felleus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tylopilus_felleus ) , you damn bitter bastard , i 'm looking at you ! ) . 
  after only a couple of mushrooms even total beginner can safely pick some mushrooms . 
  i speak from experience , taught some people who never picked before . 
  in polish `` sromotnik bezwstydny '' , literally `` scandalous unashamed '' , but latin name is pretty cool too . 
   three words : turkey , mushrooms , sour cream . 
  okay , four words . 
  excuse me , are you from spanish inquistion by any chance ? 
  there is no true cuisine without mushrooms . 
  period . 
  picking mushrooms is sort of national sport , i 'd say most people pick mushrooms sometimes , and quite a lot are hardcore pickers who drive sometimes hundreds of kms to the `` right forest '' at 4 or 5 am every weekend during fall . 
  and during the week as well . 
  i pick my own mushrooms ( hardcore picker ) , never bought any besides button and [ oyster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pleurotus ) mushrooms , which are being bred ( in fact i consider to grow oysters on my own ) . 
  it 's a great way to relax and unwind -- i mean , what 's wrong with a walk in the forest , but * with a purpose * ? 
  most common mushrooms are : - [ bay boletes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imleria_badia ) , hands down most popular ; fun fact : according to wikipedia they 're known as `` polish muchrooms '' ( \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431 ) in ukraine , belarus and russia , - various kinds of [ leccinums ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leccinum ) , - [ boletus edulis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boletus_edulis ) , known are `` king mushrooms '' or `` true mushrooms '' ( * prawdziwek * ) , - [ saffron milk cap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactarius_deliciosus ) , - [ chanterelle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chanterelle ) , - [ parasol mushrooms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macrolepiota_procera ) , fried in bread crumbs * purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr * , - [ yellow knights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tricholoma_equestre ) , - [ honey fungus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armillaria_mellea ) , - [ suillus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suillus ) , - and many , many others . 
  by pure accident i ate bigos with mushrooms i picked lass fall as i wrote this . 
  damn , i 'm so polish . 
  also : english , get your shit together and pick names for mushrooms ... 
  that 's why they 're asking for help . 
  ca n't come with any joke by their own . 
  the cartoon gives me strong maya the honey bee vibe . 
  two of my favourite artists publish there !, 
  also very userfriendly store : you can download ( almost ) any filetype you like -- not just mp3 , but also ogg vorbis and ( drum roll ) flac !, 
  perfect . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'd like to make a trojanhorse acronym , but ca n't get past tactical ruse at the moment . 
  help ? 
  my vote is for `` zgraja kutafon\u00f3w '' if we 're going with literal translation , or `` zgraja dupk\u00f3w '' if with comparable weight . 
  but i like your translation for it too uses msle name as slang term for penis . 
  note that this has much more weight in polish . 
  compare it with `` putin huilo '' . 
  not only the church , but directly to more or less polish equivalent of westboro . 
  [ basilica in liche\u0144 ] ( http://www.encyklo.pl/images/4/47/lichen1.jpg ) needs to be on the list as well . 
  guys wanted to build magnificent church , but could n't agree about the style . 
  so they used all of them . 
  looks like feathers to me . 
  more scientifically accurate than jurassic park . 
  take that , spielberg !, 
  also : [ relevant song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu97skdx3os ) . 
  i 'm not going into details how , but i found porn nes rom once . 
  got ta say some of the pixels were really hot . 
  my keyboard is n't very cooperative lately . 
  thanks !, 
  and my favourite ~ ~ `` wihasjter '' ~ ~ `` wihajster '' = most notably a weird mechanism ( or part of it ) , but also generally an unnamed thingy , from `` wie heisst er ? '', 
  -- `` what 's it 's name ? 
  is it just me , or the atomic bear is trying to destroy north america ? 
  goodnight , sweet prince . 
  [ solbus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solbus ) is also great . 
  edit :  [ in the 1990s , the company [ solaris ] developed its own research office and used computer software originally developed for the design of space shuttles . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solaris_bus_%26_coach#history ) see , this is why we can not into space . 
  we took space shuttle software and ended up with bus anyway ... 
  also , jokingly , when you pronounce `` dupa '' ( `` doopa '' , as in `` doom '' ) with '' \u0142 '' ( `` w '' in `` wash '' ) . 
  extra layer of humour : dupa means ass . 
  russia can into irony . 
  finally , [ commonwealth of three nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian\u2013ruthenian_commonwealth ) . 
  and they 're all interested in balls !, 
  nailin ' . 
  it is a part of trinity ? 
  i 'd say that people generally do realize such thing exists , but unless our boys or girls are winning something at the time , virtually no one pays any attention . 
  it 's always football this , football that . 
  which is really ridiculus considering the state of polish football . 
  `` dear good tsar , the boyars are evil .

  actually welsh is utilyzed quite a lot by fantasy writers . 
  from the top of head : in sapkowski 's the witcher it 's the base of old speech , in haydon 's rhapsody series ( among other things , prominent role play people called cymrians , no joke ) , also i believe tolkien . 
  but most expensive is amazing . 
  no , that 's why graph should start with zero . 
  edit : for the downvoters : - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misleading_graph - it 's even a wikipedia rule : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:don't_draw_misleading_graphs ( for some strange reason it does n't open for me now , but the page and rule exists ), 
   sends it 's romani legions all over europe romani ite domum . 
  even orban knows president and -- especially -- pm are nothing but puppets . 
  we 're citizens of formerly earthian continent of europe . 
  according to 2061 : odyssey three crashing and rescue mission is fine , as long we do n't disturb europans . 
  no , it 's not . 
  all these worlds are ours , except europa . 
  we should attempt no landing there . 
  and yet complaining the least . 
  i mean , poles do not complain ? 
  there are a major disturbances in the force for sure . 
  someone call black widow . 
  big guy needs his lullaby . 
  / r/russiadenies already exists , now we just need / r/russiaenraged . 
  head of the parliamentary club of ruling party and deputy speaker of sejm said ( translation a bit rough , but you get the idea ) :  in my opinion , during last weeks , regarding things about constitutional trubunal , we were dealing with -- and that 's my opinion -- with extremely unreliably public media . 
  and this , among other things , requires us to hurry * [ the new law has been proceeded extremely fast , like in a day or so ] * . 
  if media thinks they can talk in coming weeks about themselves , meaning criticizing our changes , and plans of our changes , then it needs to be stopped . 
  public media are not to be party of the political dispute . 
  their job is to provide reliable information , which they do n't in my opinion . 
  * and spokeswoman of ruling party literally said :  we hope the narrative in media we do n't agree with will cease to exist . 
  and we will break through with what we really do . 
  ) * draw your own conclusions . 
  edit : on the other hand of course all governments put `` their '' people in public media ( and not only there ) eventually . 
  at least current one is very open about the actual reasons . 
  i 'm sure transport department spared no expenses . 
  you play with 15 letters in your hand ? 
  i prefer `` prezymier '' .
