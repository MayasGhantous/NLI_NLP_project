  truth be told , people also make me hate people . 
  i may be wrong , but i thought it was more about the style fidesz won in hungary , literally steamrolling over previous compromised government . 
  not that he does n't also like how orban runs the country ( maybe besides his business with russia ) . 
  if i 'm right , what kaczy\u0144ski said may yet come true . 
  but he wo n't be polish orban in this scenario , oh no . 
  the funny thing is media every so often did mention tk , when it rules something unconstitutional , when opposition ( and on rare occasions also the government , i actually remember at least one ) sues a law to tk ( or threatens to ) , etc. 
  and at least some of us actually do know something about how the country is running . 
  my theory is he 's just projecting his own ignorancy .

  operation `` kraj 2015 '' , anyone ? 
  yes , before presidential elections in may 2015 right wingers were buzzing about foreign military intervention in case previous president does n't win in first round . 
  spoiler alert : no such thing happened .

  for the record : the `` under the ... '' name is polish convention , if it was natively english inn , it 'd be named red pig inn ( red hog , more precisely ) . 
  and once it settled , my grandma pops in arguing it 's actually neither white borsch nor \u017curek , but zalewajka , because * list of reasons i ca n't remember * . 
   opposition making poland pathetic let me guess , you 're raping logic right now , because it dresses like a slut ?

  agreed , he 's rather useful idiot . 
  during last and this term he probably did for russian inteligence more than many spies . 
  doubt it 'd be casus belli , but for sure would be illegal ( speaking of civilian ships ) .

  while what you said is true , it needs to be said that current gov broke the constitution way more . 
  you see , it 's not uncommon for gov to break the constitution , but then someone sues the law to constitutional tribunal , it makes a verdict , and gov either fixes the law to make it constitutional or not , which makes it invalid . 
  and everything is back on tracks . 
  now current gov put itself above the constitutonal tribunal ( and the constitution itself ) first proclaming all nominations by previous parliament ( funny enough apparently they voted for some of them ) unconstitutional ( which is ct 's job ) , and then when ct made a verdict 3 of the new judges were nominated legally ( 2 others were indeed illegaly ) and president is oblidged to take their oath , new gov went `` fuck you , we know better '' . 
   hahaha , did they really chant ` warsaw is not budapest ' ? 
  a bit of background : 4 years ago ( or 8 ? 
  ) , when jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski ( leader of ruling party and grey eminence behind somewhat puppet president and prime minister ) lost elections and at the same time orban won in hungary , he said `` there will come time when there will be budapest in warsaw '' . 
  there is a country where elks call you .

  yes , but in that case you also need to build terminal to regas the liquid gas and pump it into the pipeline . 
  or at least have access to mobile terminal ( another kind of ship ) , either build one or rent it like lithuanians did .

  i 'd say the word `` sabotage '' is more apt .

  i 'm not agreeing with him either , but that 's not the reason to dv , he can have some point and the discussion might be interesting .

   first , recently in pozna\u0144 media reported that a syrian man assaulted a woman . 
  later it turned out , that he did n't assault a woman , but a group of few men , and did n't assault , but was beaten by them because of his skin colour .
