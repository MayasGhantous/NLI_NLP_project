  nice flair . 
  the other way around it 's possible , tho . 
  \\* military coup ? 
  checks calendar in disbelief . \\* \\* yep , it 's still is 2016 . \\*, 
  we spared no ~ ~ expense ~ ~ opportunity . 
  is moonshine all right ? 
  why ca n't we have educational porn , dammit ? 
  and in the meantime steals your food . 
  i 've heard of certain physical services . 
  and dragons !, 
  oh , i do n't know . 
  let 's decide through referendum about that . 
  lol @ [ that guy with the `` save our nhs '' sign ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zobte5j.png ) . 
  and when our politicians or people act irresponsibly or plain stupid we 're complaining we 're not yet a matured democracy like uk is . 
  the `` number 10 '' meaning prime minister 's office ? 
  as in 10 downing street ? 
  this whole affair would absolutely hillarious , if it was n't for real . 
  i am terribly sorry for the remain-voters . 
  they got seriously screwed by relatively small margin . 
  i feel kinda schadenfraude for true leave-voters . 
  but the protest-voters that did n't really wanted to leave just baffels me . 
  they intentionally screwed themselves knowing from polls that margin between leave and remain is so small . 
  and it really caught my by surprise . 
  you see , quite often when people or politicians do something straight stupid or inaprioprate , we blame it on the fact that we 're not mature democracy yet , we still need to learn how to use it properly , the spirit of old communist times has n't died yet and we need a bit more time to act as reasonably as `` old democracies '' - and uk always was one of the examples of such proper democracy . 
  turns out , they 're capable to equally - if not more - stupid things as we do . 
  oh , also `` bregreters '' who got second thoughts literally the day after . 
  seriously ?!, 
  i mean it 's totally legit to change your opinion ( `` only cow does n't change her opinion '' , as we say here ) , but if you do this so quickly , it was n't opinion in the first place , but a simple whim . 
  congratulations , you changed the future of entire country on a whim , good job !, 
  meanwhile in / r/poland a guy is asking if he can get polish passport if he was born in uk and has polish mum . 
  i can see a majestik m\u00f8\u00f8se lurking behind it from up here . 
  what 's wrong with mega w\u0105tek ? 
  [ they ruined scotland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iusuq4-f5u ) . 
  `` decently '' is a bit of an understatement . 
  thanks , romania !, 
  tbh , i always thought it 's symetrical . 
  never heard that . 
  another joke : why the view from the palace is so nice ? 
  because you ca n't see it from there . 
  i 'm from warsaw and i kinda like it . 
  sure , it 's history is ugly , and socreal details in close-up are , well , socreal , but overall it 's sort of nice . 
  they 'll never learn : - 2009 : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/4935429/bnp-uses-polish-spitfire-in-anti-immigration-poster.html - 2014 : http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/28/britain-first-polish-spitfire-_n_6387812.html?1419803346, 
  that 's a great advice , but i have nowhere to go back to . 
  now what ? 
  know that feel , to be honest . 
  mugshot still counts . 
  same here , except to me it sounds exactly what he would say . 
  not jkm believer , though . 
  great news . 
  current gov and their crooks almost doubled the amount of money raised in only two years !, 
  finally i have something to say when someone asks `` surely you 're not just a hater and can name at least one thing they did right ? '', 
  sorry guys , it was accident . 
  this clown actually managed to get elected twice in his almost 30yo carier . 
  first in 1990 when there was no electoral threshold ( note his party got half as much seats as purely satirical polish beer lover 's party ) , and second in 2015 when there was extremaly low turnout ( 20-something % ) so he just barely passed the threshold . 
  they cunt into an anus . 
  generation y. 
  that bullshit actually happened to me . 
  believe it or not . 
  i hear people speaking ukrainian every day in warsaw ( and sometimes i do n't , you can have a perfect conversation in polish with some of them and could n't tell they 're not polish , until you use some slang word they do n't know yet ; sure they have slight `` sing-a-song '' accent , but not different to people from eastern parts of poland ) and can point at least several grocieries with ukrainian staff . 
  do n't know actual numbers , but ukrainian minority certainly is noticeable . 
  every time of year . 
  more magical than tahiti ? 
  those are just tourists . 
  they are bread baskets . 
  i know only / u/convertstometric, 
  only after they switched sides . 
  yo mama is so fat , she sleeps in two countries at once .

  unfortunately , by then she fireproofed her clothing . 
  dragons are pretty cool , but better not to give them any rakija - they ca n't hold their drink . 
  or fire , for that matter . 
  it is delusional . 
  get popcorn while it 's still there .

  ama . 
  poland can into planet . 
  it 's hard to breed seahorses in sweden 's climate . 
  explanation : in the series he 's so uninfluencial ( all the time waits in the lounge to be permitted to enter part chairman 's office ) no one can even remember his name . 
  can confirm . 
  / s really is there . 
  oh , also minister did say that . 
  he 's that kind of guy . 
  whatever will happen , it will happen long before 10th of august , the next monthly celebration of smolensk crash by pis . 
  because if the protest colides with it , ruling party is doomed . 
  10 years ago , last time current party was ruling , they went on a elaborate camping against teletubies for promoting gay . 
  seriously , wish i was shitting you .

  it 's ophelia !, 
  brexit would make hillarious sitcom that no one would watch for being too far-fetched and unrealistic . 
  thanks/dzi \u0119ki !, 
  huh , out of curiosity : is the name of lt. fairfax from ` allo ` allo a reference to this phrase ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  a bus ? 
  you mean a starship !, 
  pretty sure he 'll negotiate eu to pay for nhs too . 
  to win , we need / r/the _ lord before next elections .
