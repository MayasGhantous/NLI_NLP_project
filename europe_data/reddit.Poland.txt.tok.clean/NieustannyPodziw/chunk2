  it 'd be censored as well . 
  munich 's report shows that tco of linux and windows ( staff , training , etc. ), 
  is comparable :  costs that are not related to the operating system , such as staff and training costs , were identically listed at around $ 22 million ( # 17 million ) in all three scenarios [ windows + ms office , windows + openoffice , linux + openoffice ] . 
  http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/linux-brings-over-eur10-million-savings-for-munich-1755802.html of course microsoft highly disagrees with their `` internal study that aims at providing a sound line of argument with customers '' , but if you look closely at this report it has a lot of holes and unsourced guesses : - http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/microsoft-study-linux-migration-cost-munich-eur60-7-million-1789679.html - http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/microsoft-partly-releases-study-on-munich-s-linux-migration-1792733.html -- few years ago i was doing some research for an article about migrations to floss ( linux and/or openoffice/libreoffice ) , and long story short : - most on unsuccessful cases failed because municipality did n't allocate any money for it -- they suddenly realized they have no money for an upgrade , decided to switch to floss because it 's free and * of course * they do n't need a cent to migrate , but when it miraculously failed they somehow manage find few millions to buy new computers and proprietary software . 
  - cost of training staff and maintenance is comparable . 
  cost of converting documents is a bit ( but not that much ) higher in case of migrating to linux and/or openoffice/libreoffice . 
  cost of converting/rewriting of in-house software depends on how it 's written -- web based an multiplatform software ( java & co. ) usually require none to only a little work , other may require more work and sometimes it 's better to keep windows on a few computers or use it via thin client when it 's needed . 
  - low-tech staff is n't really a problem -- they always whine a lot , not only when you switch from windows to linux , but also from one windows version to another . 
  it 's just what they do . 
  - biggest problem for administration unit when migrating to floss is n't money , or staff , but other administration units who did n't migrate . 
  whataboutism !, 
  but on a serious note , agreed . 
  capitalism is n't only human doctrine that is harmful for the planet . 
  yes , it helped humans a lot . 
  but humans are n't the planet . 
  i guess among those psychos it 's sort of penis enlargment ceremony . 
   maybe in poland they mention it in school . 
  that 's indeed the case . 
  i think that one general `` non-europeans hanging out on / r/europe '' is n't a bad idea . 
  well , i 'm surprised . 
  i always thought it was a common knowledge , like the year of grunwald/tannenberg battle ^ ( ( do n't ask for a day and month ) ^ ) and so on . 
  removed and kept at the same time . 
  you mean `` look for '' . 
  ^ ( for those who do n't get the joke : polish `` to look for '' = czech `` to fuck '' . ), 
  pretty sure it 's some proper si unit . 
   we are literally worse than ~ ~ hitler stalin ~ ~ putin . 
  everyone who is n't complete and utter ignorant knows that many people ( with our government in the lead ) escaped from poland in september 1939 via romania . 
  other than that we ( myself included , sadly ) know nothing more to be honest . 
   the stereotype about romania is that it 's smr\u00f3d , br\u00f3d and ub\u00f3stwo ( a popular polish expression literally meaning : stink , dirt and poverty ) . 
  but we have similar stereotype about bulgaria , which scored not that bad , and bulgaria and romania are in general perceived very alike . 
  so i 'd say romania 's score is only a `` gypsy factor '' and linguistics ( `` romanian '' is almost a synonym of `` gypsy '' in polish ; i know , it 's very ignorant of us ) . 
  after all these years i still remember giveusatank cheat in gta3 . 
  after consideration i fully agree with you . 
  these are cute little bunnies . 
  that still means we have an imagery of * someone * launching a missile . 
  unless their ids or something are clearly visible . 
   i think lit-pol commonwealth is still the only state that had ever held moscov mongolia ? 
  are n't aa missiles introduce themselves to plane they 're flying into ? 
  something like `` hi , i 'm a missile launched by xyz , i 'm going to shoot you down . 
  have a nice day , brush your teeth and do n't eat yellow snow '' ? 
  i totally thought they were . 
  we have numerous proofs . 
  separatists claiming shooting down a `` military transport plane '' in exact time and place using buk ( online and in intercepted calls ) , video made by separatists visiting crash place for the first time describing ukrainian plane il-something and hesitating on the spot while realising it 's not . 
  separatists ( and russian media too ) hastily removing any proof they did have buk launchers and moving one of them to russia . 
  even exact spot where from the missile has been launched was found in rebel controlled area . 
  and so on . 
  maybe they were n't hand caught in the act , but all of this proofs leads to conclusion it 's them who shoot down mh17 . 
  no one ( maybe except nuts ) says they deliberately shoot down civilian malaysian plane , almost certainly they genuinely thought they 're aiming at ukrainian military plane , but none the less it was rebels who shoot down the plane , * probably * ( only probably , this we ca n't proove for certain ) with rocket provided by russians . 
   couple months of strong talking , ukraine will lose part of it 's territory and everything will settle down until the next time . 
  all of this already happened . 
  well , maybe weeks of strong talking , not months . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  while we 're at it , much more known http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadrian's_wall, 
  there is no doubt the [ old dragon 's head ] ( http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/07/old-dragons-head-where-great-wall-of.html ) , where the wall meets the sea , was completely rebuilt in 1980s after it was destroyed to the ground by bombs in early 1900s . 
  and while the original great wall used to meet the sea * something like that * , one could say it was ( re ) built from scratch in a matter of speaking ( just like , for example , warsaw 's old town was ( re ) built from scratch after it was completely destroyed during wwii ) . 
  also i have heard , ** though ca n't find any source now ** , it was rebuilt in a little different place -- i vaguely remember something about the shoreline has moved since original gwoc was built and new place is a bit more accessible and attractive . 
  but , as i said , ca n't show any reliable source to support that . 
  let 's make a kickstarter campaign , buy the ships and become `` concerned citizens '' somewhere . 
  ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ pirates ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ somalia . 
  not all of the great wall of china is made of stone or brick [ like this fragment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:20090529_great_wall_8185.jpg ) . 
  and most sections that are , were n't built like that at first , but `` upgraded '' after some time . 
  edit : http://www.travelchinaguide.com/china_great_wall/construction/material.htm, 
  since english wikipedia article is a stub , here 's a map and reconstruction of the wall from ukrainian wiki : - http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/uk/5/59/zkarta.jpg - http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/uk/4/4f/zshema.jpg, 
  he 's got the best wingmen ever !, 
  should n't nato and/or eu be civilised enough to prohibit selling weapons to countries supporting terrorism ? 
  and it 's not hard to `` stretch '' this definition to russia since last few months . 
  ( not to mention militarily annexing parts of sovereign states ) . 
  poland : - all sport shoes : adidasy ( adidas ) - all diapers : pampersy ( pampers ) - bicycle : rower ( rover , which before wwii used to make bicycles popular in poland ) - razor : \u017cyletka ( gilette ) - off-road 4x4 car : d\u017cip ( jeep ) - ( in some regions ) vacuum cleaners : elektroluks ( electrolux ) - most of painkillers : aspiryna ( aspirin ) - to search something online : guglowa\u0107 ( google ) - retouched image : fotoszop , fotoszopka ( photoshop ) edit : - any mobile toilet : toitoi ( toi toi ), 
  if worsens ? 
  sure , let 's make ukraine surrender , later we can make `` i bring you peace '' speech . 
  it worked excellent 75 years ago . 
  remove 4 spaces in front of the line . 
  is it just me , or they kinda look like predator ? 
  holidays like independence day , freedom and civil liberties day on [ anniversary of first after wwii semi-free elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_legislative_election,_1989 ) , [ may 3rd constitution day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_3rd_constitution_day ) , before new elections ( apolitically , only to invite people to vote ) and so on . 
  i 'm fairly sure also on new year or christmas ( probably referred to as simply holidays ) . 
  `` some in poland '' actually wonder who nigel farage is . 
   but you always read them the same way not always , but most of the time . 
  `` sze\u015b\u0107set '' is pronounced more like `` szejset '' , the beginning of `` zintegrowa\u0107 '' is n't prnounced like `` zima '' and so on . 
  not to mention `` linie '' pronounced differently depending on the context ( `` spacer po linie '' vs. `` dwie linie '' ) . 
  polish is n't always so straight forward , there 's a reason why it 's considered as one of the most challenging to learn languages . 
  yes , it 's too bad that [ this thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian%e2%80%93ruthenian_commonwealth ) did n't work out . 
  instead of fighting each other , we could 've work together , and perhaps history of the world would be much different . 
  it 's pronounced `` toosk '' . 
   government websites even claimed it the biggest success of polish presidency yes , i was actually rotfling hard when they changed the headline `` acta is another great success of polish presidency '' once the shitstorm began . 
  yes , they discarded many reports about acta and `` public consultation '' were a farce . 
  and yes , once the protests started tusk chickened out , and was n't very much supportive for acta . 
  but after the debate , when he was convinced that protesters really had serious concerns toward the agreement , he actually switched sides and began urging other heads of states to drop acta . 
  not that his voice was the most significant reason acta died , but still . 
  in the end i think tusk in regard of acta did his job . 
  i do n't want to complain , but we do like to complain actually . 
   it was polish presidency headed by tusk that was pushing acta back in 2012 truth be told acta would be pushed regardless of the country currently in charge , it 's not like it suddenly popped out during the months of polish presidency -- it was being concocted since 2006 iirc . 
  and while at first polish gov ' was very proud because of acta , once the great shitstorm began , tusk actually did his job pretty well . 
  remember 7-8 hours long debate ? 
  truth be told i 'd prefer fm for sikorski . 
  i think he 'd more competent as foreign minister thank tusk as president . 
  but yeah , it 's something , 
  the president or prime minister do , but rarely -- maybe 3 times a year , on big national holidays and occasions . 
  sometimes it ; s live , but most of the times it 's pre-recorded . 
  i do n't very much like the idea of hosting world cup , but with stadiums and some of the infrastructure already built , the whole thing might not be a financial disaster actually .
