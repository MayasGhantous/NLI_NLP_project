  for some of the stadiums it can be even a life saving event . 
  ukrainian nemiroff is also superb . 
  and please bear in mind it 's a pole who said that . 
  but i really liked takeshi 's castle . 
  and til it 's a show from late 80 's !, 
  just look at western germany , it 's a total mess compared to glorious eastern germany , not to mention other post-soviet countries !, 
  `` failed '' is an understatement . 
  and cutting the gas off is n't a military operation . 
   let 's do that with efta , eea , eu , schengen zone and eurozone . 
  and un , 
  and in national language , nice , 
  i still hear people saying czechoslovakia from time to time ... 
  to me baltic states are easy , however i ca n't just point one of them , i always have to name them in order ( from south , or from poland ) : lithuania , latvia , estonia . 
  this one 's great , thanks . 
  not really , you simply enter names of countries and they pop-up on a map by themselves . 
  but yes , i probably should search for something like this ... 
  here 's my map : http://i.imgur.com/bky6r4l.jpg - correct : 45 if i 'm counting correctly ( well , montenegro and albania were semi-intelligent guesses ) - incorrect : apparently 0 - did n't know : 2 ( armenia and azerbaijan ) - forgot about : 4 ( monaco , vatican , malta , liechtenstein ), 
  not moldovan , but trust me on this one : any place where you can drink local wine . 
  ok then , found even better location : a bit north of olympus mons . 
  this may come as a shock , but first of all i 'd put russia far , far away . 
  somewhere near new zealand ( sorry , guys ) . 
  the one linked under the word `` this '' . 
  here you go :  hungary pm orban told his ambassadors monday he plans to build an eu coalition to stop sanctions against russia . 
  `` we will have to seek the company of those eu member states who are interested in slowing and stopping this separation process , '' he said , afp reports . 
  thanks to putin . 
  this is the most epic headline ever . 
  yes , english article is a bit stub-ish , polish article is much more elaborate and has some sources : http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/boles%c5%82aw_zapomniany still the existence of boles\u0142aw the forgotten is n't 100 % sure ( but in a sense that 's the point with the `` forgotten duke '' ) and most of the contemporary historians actually doubt his existence , claiming it 's probably either fantasy of the chronicler trying to fill the blank or some mistake . 
   opening that site on mobile was if my phone had a seizure . 
  i recommend opera mini , my phone is n't exactly new , but it survived . 
   and sorry , i probably should mention this is quite elaborate report , not another five paragraph cheap article . 
  according to some legends [ boles\u0142aw the forgotten ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boles%c5%82aw_the_forgotten ) is probably the winner :  a semi-legendary duke of poland of the piast dynasty from 1034 until his death in 1038 or 1039 . 
  ( ... ) according to the chronicle he was killed and deleted from the list of monarchs because of his cruelty . 
  in more recent and not as legendary history [ wojciech jaruzelski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wojciech_jaruzelski ) is a good candidate . 
  i lived in a communist dictatorship for a few years only . 
  is this why my sarcasm detector is still working ? 
  of course there were people in favour of the invasion or not giving a damn , i did n't want to sound like all were against , sorry and thanks for clariffication . 
  really ? 
  then fuck them even more . 
  people in poland [ were also against ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryszard_siwiec ) , sadly the government did what he was told . 
  also : til , thanks . 
  sorry guys . 
   a crowd of half-naked , sweaty , furious tourists is blocking the road and refusing to let any cars with ukrainian license plates pass toward the port . 
  number of nodes ( `` points '' that create a map ) in given area . 
  brighter area = more nodes . 
  here 's a map with people who made their first contribution to osm in the last days : http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/newestosm.php ( [ screenshot for future reference ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zzplohu.png ) ) . 
  and some numbers : http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/newestosmlist.php ( [ screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qrdhvzb.png ) . 
  can you guess in which country major websites posted an article about osm ? 
  edit : screenshots one day after the article : http://i.imgur.com/npqymrh.jpg http://i.imgur.com/nqrjnpl.png, 
  i may be wrong , but to my best knowledge far-left is n't much pro-russian . 
  well , some probably are , but in general not really . 
  like i said in previous comment even [ sld ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_left_alliance ) , which has [ serious ties ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_loan ) to russia ( note that miller is currently the leader of sld ) , and usually has a really soft touch for our eastern neighbour , avoid pro-russian rhetoric as much they can palikot is , as far i can tell , openly anti-russian ( at least in russia-ukraine conflict ) . 
  edit : can not into grammar, 
  according to someone on / r/ukrainianconflict he 's not the guy who put it there , but who 's taking it down . 
  because of our history , poland is -- to put it mildly -- * rather wary * about russia . 
  therefore the pro-russian voice is n't really strong . 
  it exists , yes , but it 's mostly right-wing nutters , who 'd do anything to show how anti-eu/anti-mainstream/anti-whatever they are . 
  ( and i imagine their strongly anti-russian right-wing followers have a really hard time trying to wrap their head around this ) . 
  even sld , the post-communists party , with their obvious polish people 's republic/soviet union/russia ties , try hard not to be too much pro-russian . 
  dat logic !, 
  no , but close -- the sound is charczenie . 
  subbed : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm, 
   i had no idea you all made fun of other europeans so much in your sayings so you want these ? 
  ok : - czeski film ( czech movie ) -- a strange situation when no one have the slightest idea what 's going on - nie udawaj greka ( do n't pretend to be greek ) -- do n't play dumb , do n't try to fool me - zakr\u0119cony jak ruski termos -- this one is a play on words , `` zakr\u0119cony '' means both sealed/tightened or crazy/weird , so literally it translates as `` sealed like a rooskie vacuum flask '' , but means `` really , really crazy/weird '', 
  oh , we 've got quite a lot of this ( one hundred and one usages of `` ass '' , some really hilarious ) , but my favourite one is probably `` sranie w bani\u0119 '' [ more or less * sranye v banye * ] ( extra points for rhyme for this one ) , literally means `` shitting into head '' , equivalent of `` bullshit '' or `` bollocks '' when someone says some unbelievable story . 
  for example : '' ... and then i caught this 25 kg fish '' . 
  out of curiosity : what exactly happens when a country is violating wto terms ? 
  they , at least some of them , can go back . 
  and they do . 
  while shits and giggles were n't the main reason , i 'm sure they were ' t irrelevant either . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_kazakhstan according to [ polish wikipedia ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/polacy_w_kazachstanie ) , with the newer 2009 census , there are 34 057 poles in kazakhstan . 
  by that definition , traveling by full bus/tram with bad ac ( or no ac and tiny windows , which is main reason why i miss ikaruses -- they were pretty basic , but had huuuuge windows ) in current weather is an extreme sport . 
   i ride on a bike for 20 minutes -- and i 'm fine . 
  i wait on a bus stop for 2-3 minutes -- kinda hot , but still fine . 
  i squeeze in to a fully loaded bus and go 1 stop for about 1-1 .5 minute -- and suddenly i 'm all sweaty . 
   i am entirely perplexed by bike riders . 
  it is a sport , and treating a sport as a commute is imho not a good combination so is [ driving ] ( http://www.formula1.com/wi/gi/597x478/xvuw/sutton/2013/d13mon247.jpg ) . 
  or even [ walking ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racewalking ) for that matter . 
  yeah , that was stupid . 
  they replaced it with a weekend ticket , because no one visits warsaw between monday and friday !, 
  on the other hand i love replacing single fare ticket with single fare/75 minutes ( 90 for second zone ) ticket . 
  although they could keep 40 minute ticket for second zone , now we have only 20 minutes or 90 minutes for the second zone . 
  ** warsaw , poland ** during spring , summer and autumn i usually rent [ a public bike ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/12/artykul/178613,bike-boom-gets-into-top-gear-in-poland ) operated by german company nextbike . 
  it 's partly subsided by the municipality , and it 's really cheap -- 20 minutes for free , 1 hour 1 z\u0142 ( ~ 0.25 eur ) , 2 hours 4 z\u0142 ( ~ 1 eur ) , 3 hours 7 z\u0142 ( ~ 1,75 eur ) and so on , and with [ dens network of station ] ( http://en.veturilo.waw.pl/locations/ ) it 's really great -- you can get to many places within free 20 minutes ( i usually manage to do that ) or 1 hour . 
  in my experince you have to try really hard ( or go to a place where are no stations ) to rent a bike for more than one hour . 
  i only wish we had more bike lanes and parkings , but we 're getting there slowly . 
  you can use your bike with public transport as long as there is a space to do that ( so except rush hour you 're quite good ) . 
  you do n't have to pay an extra ~ ~ share ~ ~ fare ( at least in buses , trams and metro , not 100 % sure about trains ) . 
  the bus/trams network is , i 'd say , quite good . 
  though of course it could be better in suburbs . 
  so far we have only one metro line , but first segment of the second should be open within a month or two . 
  [ ticket prices ] ( http://www.ztm.waw.pl/index.php?c=110&amp;l=2 ) are i believe relatively low compared with other countries , however if you take our earnings into an account they 're quite costly . 
  and a series of annual raises during last few years ( boil the frog slowly ! ), 
  certainly did n't helped with that , we had to organize a referendum to oust the mayor of warsaw , to make municipality do something about the prices ( referendum failed , but still some `` referendum miracles '' happened ) . 
  edit : some maps : - http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/52.2276/21.0495&amp;layers=t - http://www.ztm.waw.pl/?c=198&amp;l=2 - http://www.ztm.waw.pl/?c=199&amp;l=2 ^ ( edit 2 : can not into grammar ), 
  it 's an italian car after all . 
  for those wondering what kind of a wonder of motorization the polish car is : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fso_syrena, 
  and in 2015 :  thanks to russian annexation the number of tourists who visited crimea this year grew by 200 % *   ^ ^ * ) ^ ^ compared ^ ^ with ^ ^ the ^ ^ previous ^ ^ year, 
  a couple of antique trams of warsaw , some are in use on special occasions or on touristic line t every ( at least in season ) weekend : - http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/tramwaje_w_warszawie#tramwaje_zabytkowe.5b15.5d.5b16.5d - http://kmkm.waw.pl/index.php/tabor-zabytkowy/tramwaje/117-tramwaje see also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_warsaw, 
  andorra 's parliament is so cute , 
  also you have stability , you do n't have to go to castings all the time hoping you 'll finally get some role .
