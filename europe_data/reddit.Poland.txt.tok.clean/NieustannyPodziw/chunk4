  until russian airlines will be banned in europe , that is . 
  [ jaka to melodia ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaka_to_melodia%3f ) , a clone of american show name that tune . 
  on air in prime time since 1997 , every day except saturdays . 
  awful show with people pretending they have fun ( well , some actually can have fun ... ) , host with annoying personality , show `` artists '' ~ ~ raping ~ ~ rapeing well-known songs and actual artists performing their songs ( all is from playback of course and if you squint you can barely see it 's not ) . 
  also soap operas like [ klan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klan_ ( tv_series \\ ) ) or [ m jak mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m_jak_mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 ) . 
  edit : goodness , how could i forget about [ familiada ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/familiada ) , a clone of american show family feud . 
  the host actually [ become a meme ] ( http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/46561828.jpg ) of ( for ? ), 
  cringeworthy and completely unfunny jokes . 
  and since some time contestants are n't really families , but for example `` pie lovers '' , `` late sleepers '' and so on . 
  the plan is it would n't play music in every bus every time it 's turning , because indeed it 'd start to be annoying very soon , but only once in a while in some of the buses . 
  uff , i was afraid they shared the fate of the [ aral sea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aral_sea ) . 
  those people are just jealous . 
  also , few months ago some people on the internet made ~ ~ joke ~ ~ serious proposition that those buses should play accordion music while turning . 
  and public transport department in warsaw actually though it 's a fun idea , there is a technical possibility to do that and they 're all for it . 
  http://wawalove.pl/mza-chce-wprowadzic-autobusy-grajace-jak-akordeon-a11662 ( polish ; no very understandable when translated automatically , but you 'll get the idea ) sadly as far as i know it has n't been done yet :(, 
  oh yes , because everyone making a * shitty * puns about putin are actually hoping for a war . 
  great deduction skills !, 
  agreed . 
  contrary to the bird , eu and us sadly do n't give a shit when it comes to putin . 
  literally . 
  [ what do you mean alesia ?!, 
  ] ( http://comicsagogo.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/alesia.jpg ), 
  poison of choice : homemade [ nalewka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nalewka ) , especially my uncle 's blackcurrant nalewka . 
  as of vodkas i enjoy polish \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka and krupnik , and ukrainian nemiroff ( the pepper one rocks ! ) . 
  casual non-hard alcoholic drink ? 
  mostly beers . 
  no strong preferences , but i prefer the ones from small , local breweries . 
  i also enjoy red wine , no strong preferences either . 
  i totally forgot : placki ziemniaczane - [ potato pancakes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potato_pancake#polish_monastic_tradition ), 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  ^ ^ my ^ ^ mom 's ^ ^ bigos ^ ^ is ^ ^ better !, 
   pizza with ketchup !, 
  tastes the best when it 's from microwave , and you 're eating it wearing socks and sandals . 
  bigos , marinated penny bun/porcino/cep ( * [ boletus edulis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boletus_edulis ) * ) and ice-cold \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka . 
  i actually become hungry while writing this , though i just ate . 
  edit : as for recipe : 1 . 
  bigos -- well , every house has it 's own recipe and sometimes it 's actually well protected family secret . 
  the base is sauerkraut , meat and sausage . 
  and to it you can add : wild mushrooms , prunes , honey , red wine , tomatoes , garlic , onion , and many , many more things . 
  and you stew this for hours . 
  the best thing ? 
  you can cool down bigos and reheat it infinite number of times , and it get 's better every time . 
  popular proverb says \u201e bigos tastes better on the second day '' 2 . marinated wild mushrooms : step one is the most fun -- go to the woods ( or meadow , or near a lake or stream -- depends on the species ) and pick some wild mushrooms ( protip : edible are the best ) , step two is the least fun -- wash the mushrooms and check them for worms , step three pick the small and firm ones ( big and soft are n't good when marinated ) , boil them for a while in salted water with a bit of an onion , put in a jar with a few grains of pepper , allspice , juniper and a small leaf of bay laurel , then fill the jar with hot mixture of spirit vinegar 10 % and water ( i use 1:2 ratio , some people prefer milder 1:3 ratio ) , store for at least 2-3 months ( though it 's best to eat them before next season ) 3 . 
  buy vodka in a store . 
  keep it in your freezer . 
  drink . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  ps i would n't be myself if i did n't show you this little fellas : http://imgur.com/a/19veh ( yep , boletus edulis ) edit 2 : as for mushrooms , rydz ( saffron milk cap/red pine mushroom / * [ lactarius deliciosus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactarius_deliciosus ) * -- latin name sounds delicious , is n't ? ), 
  fried on butter and breaded kania ( parasol mushroom / * [ macrolepiota procera ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macrolepiota_procera ) * ) are awesome too !, 
  afaik all articles are editable by default , only in case there is an actual incident of frequent acts of vandalism or edit war administrators may decide lock them . 
  and i 'm quite sure that an entry about a model of a plane was not locked . 
   so russian hackers then changed a wikipedia entry til i 'm a hacker as well . 
  and they do . 
  against people who are responsible . 
  i guess this little detail sucks for you , putin . 
   2 . means there has been a deliberate shooting down of that airliner so if i shot someone unintentionally , just shooting at random and someone just happens to get hit , it does n't mean i committed a crime and everything is fine ? 
  `` titanik '' may not be the luckiest name . 
   one of the rebels spilled vodka and this is where your theory collapses . 
  they would n't spill vodka . 
  never . 
   hide it anyway . 
  who knows how they are disguised who on earth disguise a black box ?!, 
  are they straight stupid or that paranoid ? 
  we do n't use cancer as a swear word in poland , however we do use other illnesses as swear words , for example cholera ( \u201e cholera '' ) or stroke ( \u201e szlag '' , archaic term for stroke , nowadays used only as a swear word ) . 
  and english use pox as a curse ( \u201e pox on you ! '' ), 
  and in my country people are laughing when some blonde is hiking in mountains wearing flip flops . 
  look everyone you can fight a fucking war in 'em !, 
  those are some serious accusations . 
  are there any other sources confirming this ? 
  if this is true , this means shit keeps hitting the fan more and more . 
  i hope eu will be able . 
  and i realize that reverse effect of sanctions will be painful for us as well , but this is the cost i 'm willing to take . 
  the situation wo n't resolve on itself , something has to be done . 
  as someone said here on / r/europe ( or somewhere on reddit ) :  you either send soldiers to die , or send money to die . 
  i vote for the latter . 
  ca n't agree more . 
   putin has already admitted that the separatists did it , with russian weapons . 
  source ? 
  polish money from american pov : http://rachadams.com/lets-talk-about-money/ turns out it quite well designed practically ( size , colors ) . 
  i think he was ridiculing the `` something something . 
  here 's why '' title schema . 
  polish music : http://www.reddit.com/r/muzyka ( also , tyl \u201e muzyka '' means \u201e music '' in polish  ), 
  / r/doesnottranslate, 
  this explanation is bullshit . 
  two planes should not be allowed on one runway at the same time . 
  what if , for example , something brakes on the plane on the runway and it stops , while other plane is landing there ? 
  shit happens , you ca n't just assume everything will be okay . 
  also : how fast is landing plane going ? 
  according to my google-fu , average speed for boeing 747 is about 130-160 knots ( ~ 240-300 ~ ~ km/s ~ ~ km/h ) . 
  this means it takes about 10 seconds for the plane to travel given 900 meters . 
  you would be surprised : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pax_association, 
  yes , speaking of asses we also have an idiom \u201e to lick ass '' or \u201e to go inside one 's ass '' ( the second one is rather funnily worded if you think about it ) with the same meaning . 
  literally it means \u201e to give a blowjob '' , but it 's just a vulgar idiom that means \u201e to be nice to someone '' . 
  edit : jacek rostowski , former ( back then i believe : current ) minister of finance . 
  poles and hungarians still are on good terms , the fact that some of us may not like some hungarians ( for example in your current government ) when they do something -- from our perspective -- stupid , does n't change anything . 
  and do n't worry , our biggest opposition party love orban no matter what ( though they might be a bit confused because of orban 's good relation with putin who \u201e murdered the president of the millennium '' ) . 
  and do n't take the blowjob thing too seriously , it 's only an expression ( yes , very vulgar , but nothing more ) . 
  ps i wo n't ask back whether poles-hungarians good relations works both ways and if so , then why hungarians maintain good relations with russians , if we ( and i 'd dare to say hungarians too for obvious historic reasons ) have every reason not to . 
  at least i 've never heard about it . 
  in fact many people here find a question `` can you drive a stick shift ? '',
