  a bit funny , it 's either can you drive at all or not . 
  seriously , you convinced me , i want to go to latvia next year so much now . 
   the solstices and equinoxes should be our four major holidays for sure . 
  in poland they actually are : 1 . 
  winter solstice of course become christmas , many pagan customs are now christmas traditions , for example [ christmas tree ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_tree#poland ) , kol\u0119dowanie or [ koledari ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koledari ) ( totally assimilated by christianity : pretend that the sun is the star of bethlehem , horned prankster-spirit turo\u0144 is the devil , add three wise men and some angels and suddenly it 's oh-not-pagan-at-all  ) , empty seat for ghosts/unsuspected ~ ~ ghosts ~ ~ guest , etc. 
  spring equinox is still somewhat alive . 
  on the first day of spring young kids build an effigy of [ marzanna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marzanna ) , the goddes of winter and death , and drown it or burn it ( or both ) in order to make the winter go away . 
  for older kids it 's traunt day , when they skip school classes ( some schools actually legalize this custom , and organize trips or other activities instead of classes ) , however it 's probably not linked to equinox traditions ( not directly at least ) . 
  some other customs become easter traditions , for example [ \u015amigus-dyngus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u015amigus-dyngus ) , polish-style easter eggs , some traditional food ( ko\u0142acz , [ mazurek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mazurek_ ( cake ) #mazurek _ tradition ) , [ easter baskets ] ( http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/polisheaster/a/blessing-baskets-swieconka.htm ) , etc. 
  summer solstice we already explained in this thread . 
  autumn equinox is known as do\u017cynki or [ dozhinki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dozhinki ) , the harvest festival , probably the biggest festival in rural areas . 
  completely assimilated by christianity , usually local priest is the host of the festival . 
  people thank for the harvest , priest bless it and farmer 's equipment , and later there 's a big feast . 
  thanks for your reply , sounds like a lot of fun , 
  ouch . 
  break your pen !, 
  ca n't get any shorter . 
  suddenly i feel like i 'd fancy some fish and assembly some furniture . 
  interesting , thanks for reply !, 
   when animals gain power of speech on a side note : in poland animals speak with human voice on christmas eve, 
   adult male programmer gets from our world into the world of magic , [ in ] the body [ of ] 13-year-old girl . 
  much . 
  awesome . 
  but seriously , kiril eskov 's [ the last ringbearer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_last_ringbearer ) is one of the best books ever . 
   `` russian paratrooper vasiliy is transported into the 30th century and becomes the only hope of planet earth against the murderous hordes of pan-galactoamerican semitomacaques '' 10/10 , would read again . 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 2 . 
  singaporean 3 . 
  english ( england ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  russian 2 . 
  hungarian 3 . 
  polish close enough for me , 
  it 's the best . 
  but i 'd love to hear some non-pole ( and non-slav ) trying to pronounce it . 
   caught the attention of the usual defenders of `` traditional values '' and is accused of propagating communism but of course , lenin is literally waving his dick on traditional values !, 
  no wonder the statue is * pissing * them off !, 
   the article `` quotes '' original thanks for your comment , at first i too thought it 's a quote from the tabloid . 
  but it 's actually a quote from foreign policy 's frank jacobs ' editorial ( linked in the article : \u201e [ in the words of foreign policy 's frank jacobs ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/06/04/what_russia_could_look_like_in_2035_if_putin_gets_his_wish_ukraine_irredentism ) '' . 
  yeah , it 's funny how they misspelled `` serf '' first as `` friend '' , and later as `` ally '' . 
  actually when i read the beginning of this paragraph , i 'm not sure if i should laugh or worry :  but poor poland . 
  once a firm slavic friend , then a staunch communist ally , now a wannabe westie , poland is punished for its disloyalty to mother russia by dismemberment . 
  edit : scratch that . 
  this is a quote from foreign policy 's frank jacobs ' editorial . 
   for example : belorussia was standing on the edge of a cliff , and i helped it to make step forward are you sure ? 
  according to some sources/anecdotes exactly same thing ( but about poland ) said w\u0142adys\u0142aw gomu\u0142ka , one of the communist leaders in poland , in his speech in 50 's or 60 's . 
  dunno , maybe it 's a funny coincidence , or maybe it 's just a standard anecdote '' [ insert disliked name ] said [ insert something dreadfully stupid and funny ] . '', 
  edit : quick search tells me it was n't gomu\u0142ka 's actual speech , but parody of his speech . 
  also : / u/ajuc was faster , 
  it would be better . 
  except putin would n't look in russia as a strong leader who brings back old glory of ussr . 
  besides polish : english and still a little russian . 
  i can also understand many of all slavic languages ( like all slavs ) . 
  ok , i was wrong . 
  local isps apparently offer 1 gb symmetric internet . 
  my fault i only checked big isps like upc and tp/orange . 
  out of curiosity : how much ? 
  while 22 $ is a lot for average moldovian , they still have 1 gbit symmetric internet available . 
  in poland fastest link for consumers is i believe about 250-300 mb . 
  and it is not symmetric ( for 250 mb there is 20 mb upload , ca n't find how much for 300 ) . 
   italy still has people with 56k where are your pitchforks and torches , i am asking ? 
  in poland we have [ 0.5 / 0.25 mb for free ] ( http://jdtech.pl/2012/10/aero2-free-internet-access-in-poland.html ) . 
  although the company that provides it is trying to make using it as miserable as possible lately and poland 's office of electronic communications does n't do much to call them to order . 
   russian oligarch who indirectly acquired license to extract gas in poland , did not get prolongation for it . 
  because it threatens the national security . 
    conflict in ukraine and aggressive gas policy of russia prompted s\u0142awomir brudzi\u0144ski , deputy minister of environment and chief geologist of the country , to resort to heavy weapons . 
  he considered that prolonging the gas exploration license in poland to company rwe dea , acquired recently by russian capital , will be `` a threat to national security '' . 
  and few days ago he refused [ to do it ] . 
  this is the first time when the licence grantor referrers to national security . 
    `` the decision was not easy , but it had to be taken . 
  the acquisition of the license by the company related to the russian establishment , in conjunction with the history of actions taken by these people , suggest that they will do nothing except keep the licence . 
  and we want the gas to be extracted , '' explains s\u0142awomir brodzi\u0144ski . 
  protip : using ctrl + f you can search for a text on current page . 
  for a good start you can practice with `` invasion '' or `` raid '' . 
   like what ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_poland you do n't possibly think that kingdom of poland acquired all it 's lands by sheer diplomacy ? 
  to be fair poland fought some wars and invaded some countries through the history . 
  even if there was no industrial-style genocide involved , we were no saint ( no one is , really ) . 
  as for apologies , i do n't wa n't to go through all history since 966 , but probably most recent `` incidents '' -- annexation of zaolzie in 1938 and polish intervention ( not exactly voluntary , but still ) in czechoslovakia in 1968 -- are considered as one of the darkest stains in polish history , and many are deeply ashamed of those . 
  looks like we have a different definition of `` respected '' . 
  i believe we can agree that soviet russia was to eastern europe invader , right ? 
  and i guess you ca n't hate the invader less only because he 's shitty towards it 's own people too ( this part no one 's denying ) . 
  edit : there 's also one thing . 
  we ( ok , most of us ) managed to move on with germans , as they ( most of them , with the government on top ) acknowledged they did a terrible , terrible mess in the first half of xx . 
  and we still find it difficult to move on with russians , because they ( again : most of them , with the government on top ) seem to think that nothing bad really happened through the half of xx , yes , it was n't always cheerful , but why do you hold your grudge eastern europe ? 
  something tells me many post-soviet countries will send bearded lady next year . 
  of course you can vote only once . 
   also iirc you can register to another constituency in given constituency , but you can take the document to vote in any constituency only in the constituency assigned to your registered address . 
   if you 're not registered or do n't live where you are registered ( which is extremely common among internal immigrants ) , you can just fill out a form and register at any polling station in the country , within a week or two before the election . 
  there are two options actually : 1 . register to one specific list ( usually where you actually live ) , then you vote as usual , only not in constituency assigned to your registered address , 2 . receive a document that gives you the right to cast a vote in any constituency - you just go to nearest voting station , show your id and the document , probably fill a little extra paperwork , and you 're ready to cast a vote ( usually when you travel a lot , and simple have no idea where you 're gon na be in the election day ) . 
  i was n't saying about money , but about how it looks like `` we give you this award so you can show how awesome we are '' . 
  yeah , this things is kinda funny . 
  i just edited my pots , adding this . 
  thanks anyway !, 
   he has only won once -- in 1991 , when he succeeded in getting a seat in the sejm , poland 's parliament . 
  note that he get a seat only because there was no electoral threshold during those elections . 
  his party received 2.26 % ( 3 seats ) . 
  edit : even polska partia przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 piwa ( [ polish beer-lovers ' party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers'_party ) ) received more votes ( ~ ~ 2.97 % ~ ~ 3.27 % , 16 seats ) . 
  so , well , you know . 
   most of his electorate would n't be in the voting age within the next half of decade . 
  and this is true for past two decades .
