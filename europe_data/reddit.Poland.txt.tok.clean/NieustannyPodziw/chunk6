  well , do you celebrate your birthday and why ? 
  also : it was `` 30 years without those nasty imperialists attacking our peaceful country '' . 
  omg , whole series is on youtube !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plfron1s8gtro3pt3ykg1ajdguz6ex1sot seriously people , check this out . 
  educational cartoon at it 's best . 
  co-author of the pomys\u0142owy dobromir ( ingenious dobromir ) is [ adam s\u0142odowy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adam_s\u0142odowy ) - polish guru of diy . 
  out of curiosity : are you by any chance familiar with these too ? 
  and now in the bizarre category : iron maiden ( yes , the iron maiden ) at a polish wedding in 1984 : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knc743nds4q, 
  fun fact : last year i bought french cyclocomputer . 
  the manual was in every possible language , except english . 
  i 'm not bitter about english , we need some lingua franca and english is as good as any . 
  i am however a little bitter about other more popular languages . 
  funny thing , i sometimes hear about english native speakers who come to live in poland , and they do want to learn some polish , but find it difficult as everyone switch to english when speaking to them . 
   did not want to take direct action until , i guess , japanese took direct action ? 
  this was better : `` my god . 
  they 're doing it . '', 
  ( group captain , sceptical about all claimed shooting downs , after he flew with the 303 on a mission ) . 
  * put on a tin foil hat *  for example crimean authorities may lie about water supply to prevent civil unrest . 
  or even they want to create a casus belli to annex more lands north of crimea . 
  relevant : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptijncdanvw, 
  in poland we have a euphemism `` dziecko nie z ma\u0142\u017ce\u0144skiego \u0142o\u017ca '' ( `` child not from wedlock bed '' ) , then maybe something like `` niez\u0142o\u017cny '' ( `` outofbed '' ) ? 
  however this is not in the convention i believe . 
  then perhaps `` kapusta '' or `` cabbage '' ? 
  one of the answers for a little child , when he/she is not ready for early sexual education ( you know , storks and stuff ) , asking `` where i came from ? '', 
  is `` we found you in a cabbage '' ( `` znale\u017ali\u015bmy ci\u0119 w kapu\u015bcie '' ) . 
  it 's not used for bastards only , however when a bastard child has no father , the child may be ridiculed that he/she really was found in a cabbage , hence jon cabbage or jon kapusta . 
   also we poles are obsessed with cabbage : fresh , sour ( it 's a shame for everyone that in english sauerkraut is a german loan word , not polish  ) , main ingredient of bigos , the best filling of pierogi ^ ( let the flamewar begin !, 
  ) , [ cabbage soup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabbage_soup ) , [ go\u0142\u0105bki aka pollish-style cabbage rolls ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/go\u0142\u0105bki ) , and many , many more . 
  so it fits perfectly . 
   fart - speed and in polish it means `` luck '' . 
  it 's also a brand of juice : http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/humour/images/259fartinabottle.jpg, 
  `` bitch '' also sounds exactly like `` bicz '' ( `` a whip '' ) not exactly a rude word , but can be really embarrassing in certain situations : `` preservatives '' is a false friend of `` prezerwatywy '' ( `` condoms '' ), 
  who you yeah bunny = you fucking dick ( most vulgar form of `` dick '' ), 
  ~ 10 years ago when i was in slovakia i bought a beer . 
  second sip : `` no , seriously , something is wrong with this beer . '', 
  started to read the label : `` blah blah blah nealko blah blah blah . 
  source of the gas ( 2009 ) : - local deposits : 4078.9 m m \u00b3 - imported : 9485.3 m m \u00b3 , including : - russia : 7739.9 m m \u00b3 , - germany : 1072.8 m m \u00b3 - czech : 0.3 m m \u00b3 - middle asia : 667.5 m m \u00b3 - ukraine : 4.8 m m \u00b3 consumption of gas ( 2009 ) : - industry : 59.25 % , including : - fertilizer factories : 15.45 % , - heat and power plants : 7.95 % - heat : 2.21 % , - others : 33.64 % - trade and services : 10.36 % , - households : 28.46 % - export : 0.31 % - * ogp + osd * ( no idea what this stands for ) : 1.62 % source : https://www.polsl.pl/wydzialy/rg/wydawnictwa/documents/kwartal/5_3_2.pdf [ pdf , polish ] edit : in 2013 poland extracted around 4630m m \u00b3 of the gas , but i ca n't find at the moment detailed statistics . 
  never seen it . 
  and it took me a while to get it , brilliant !, 
  welsh 2 . 
  italian 3 . 
  english with geordie accent 4 . 
  does latin counts ? 
  i have n't heard it either . 
  `` chinese stuff '' -- yes , but `` romanian stuff '' -- never . 
  edit : although [ tombac ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tombac ) , cheap imitation of gold , is called `` romanian gold '' sometimes ( because of gypsies trying to sell it , and the fact that gypsy and romanian are almost synonyms ) . 
  stereotypes about romania and romanians are still pretty bad , but i 'd say they change slowly . 
  up until 90s most polish people knew romanians ( or rather they idea of romanians ) by the shady folks who came to poland to beg , steal , whore etc. 
  but now , when it 's much easier to cross the borders and we have a chance to know each other for real , we finally can see we 're not that different . 
  to me it sounds a bit like welsh , which makes sense , since both are celtic languages . 
  probably it 's similiar to gaelic ( another celtic language from scotland ) too , but sadly i 'm not very familiar with this one . 
  at first `` anti-terrorist operation '' sounded to me like empty retoric , but it seems pro-russians ( at leats the vocal ones ) really are terrorists . 
  nah , they 're amateurs . 
  you know , it 's hard to complain on everything when economy is growing . 
  it 's killing our spirit , our national heritage . 
  and they steal our jobs !, 
  in other words : elections are coming , so i need to throw some shit in others faces and make some propaganda for my beloved joke-party ( * sorry for editorializing , but it 's hard for me to describe knp otherwise * ) . 
  poland will be the land flowing with milk and honey , once they come to power , ` am tellin ' ya . 
  pm tusk of course is no saint ( like every politician , especially politician in power ) , but even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
   but , thank god , my party ( knp ) already has at least 8.4 % support , and once we will finally get into the eu parliament , it will go to around 20 % ( a lot of poles want to vote on knp , but , because we always had like 2 % support , they think it 's just a lost vote . 
   can you believe that ? 
  an anti government , anti eu , far-right party , which has the whole public tv against it , has 8.4 % support . 
  that 's just incredible . 
  you 're still not as good as pretty similar in these terms [ samoobrona ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-defence_of_the_republic_of_poland#history ) then . 
  probably you will enter to parliament one day ( in fact i really hope you will , so more people will see how much a joke-party you are , but i doubt you will cross the electoral threshold during ep election in may ) , but wo n't last longer than them . 
   un has called bullshit - officially - on rumors about ethnic russians are being persecuted in ukraine , called these rumors disinformation wrong link, 
  even if not , south korea must be really desperate to rely on pipe that goes through north korea . 
  basically it 's like `` hey , northern bros , have this nice little tool you can bully us with by threatening to cut our gas '' . 
  eu-russia relationship would be nothing in comparison . 
  til that 's a thing at all . 
  while i 'm surprised that i 'm defending macierewicz ( or lepper , or korwin-mikke ) , i have to say he 's not in the same league . 
  nor in the second to it . 
  it always [ flies over city hall 's ] ( http://d.wiadomosci24.pl/g2/39/55/bd/65808_1209989407_1be8_p.jpeg ) ( many wonders why it 's yellow and red , not white and red  ) , and during local holidays and memorial days it usually flies next to polish flag . 
  also it 's the reason why all buses and new trams in warsaw are yellow and red . 
  and for those who are wondering , this is [ coat of arms of warsaw ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_warsaw ) : - http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/pol_warszawa_coa.svg/357px-pol_warszawa_coa.svg.png - http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/grand_coa_warsaw.png, 
  sarajevo 's flag seems very sad . 
   prague and warsaw are totally original !, 
  fun fact : name of the czech captial in polish is praga . 
  praga is also a name of [ one of the boroughs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/praga ) in warsaw ( and few centuries ago a town on the eastern bank of vistula , opposite historical warsaw ) . 
  is it real ? 
  can someone confirm it 's not a fake or some kind of provocation ? 
  i mean , i 'm all anti-russian in this conflict , but this is so ridiculous even i ca n't believe ( pro- ) russians are that stupid . 
  good for you , romanians , good to see you 're dealing with this . 
  now we need to catch up ... 
   i could n't see from the video according to theaviationist.com the video is a fake , it 's a video from syria from last year . 
  and she 's even more addicted to polish pottery . 
  bonus link from the same blog : [ making an easter egg using `` artichoke '' technique ] ( http://neveradulldayinpoland.com/polish-egg/ ), 
   april 13 , 2010, 
  tents are still better than bears . 
  and boots , left on the log right from the bear , symbolize yanukowich who fled in a haste . 
  and so the / r/ukrainiantent is born ? 
  actually , you 're right . 
  the domain name does look like one of this phony spam sites . 
  but besides the name , it does n't really look like spamsite to me , frankly i 'd be worried if spammers were making such good sites , as i 'm dealing with them on semi-professional level , and it 's much easier ( and sometimes funnier ) when they do n't try too much . 
  my bad then , sorry . 
  almost perfectly : the colours of the tent are flipped . 
  still , nice one !, 
  touch\u00e9 . 
   in either case though i think we both agree that this whole section `` concerning the etymology of the word `` ukraine '' '' is missing the truth . 
  `` missing the truth '' is a bit too strong for me .
