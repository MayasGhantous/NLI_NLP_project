  from the another slavic language native speaker 's perspective i can say both russian and ukrainian etymology may lack acknowledging the alternative explanation . 
  also i would like to point out two things : - my knowledge of russian language is , as we say , `` long time ago and not true '' , and i understand ukrainian only as far as i understand every other slavic language ( i.e. 
  quite a lot , though i do realize there are [ false friends ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_friends ) too ) , and while in polish both explanations may sound plausible , i ca n't really say if they do or do n't sound plausible in russian and ukrainian ( false friends again ) , - in the time when term `` ukraina '' was being born the commonwealth , not russia ( however it was called these days ) , had influence in ukraine , so even if the etymology is `` at the edge '' i do n't think that `` of russia '' is very likely . 
   funny how in poland it 's tough as `` at the edge of polish-lithuanian commonwealth '' , not russia . 
  it 's more complicated . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraina#etymologia ) : `` ukraina '' derives from `` kraj '' or `` the part ( of the land ) '' , and only some say it derives from `` u kraja '' or `` at the edge '' . 
   it 's quite common mistake made in polish too , but that 's because russia and ruthenia share the same core . 
  the primary example of that mistake would be that many poles are thinking that pierogi ruskie are russian pierogi when in fact these are ruthenian pierogi . 
  i would n't say so . 
  at least not to someone with a basic knowledge of the language . 
  | | country | a person | adjective | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ** russia ** | rosja | rosjanin | rosyjski | ** ruthenia ** | ru\u015b | rusin | [ rusi\u0144ski ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/j\u0119zyk_rusi\u0144ski ) or ruski | ** belarus ** | bia\u0142oru\u015b | bia\u0142orusin | bia\u0142oruski `` ruskie '' or `` rusek '' as a pejorative term is used not only for `` russian '' ( though mainly ) , but also as `` ukrainian '' and `` belarusian '' too , it 's more like '' * these * guys from the east '' . 
  so i would n't say it means anything in regards to this discussion . 
  credit goes to / u/ukrainets who posted this in / r/ukraine . 
   90 % people do n't want it 99.99999 % statistics posted without actual sources are bullshit . 
   and you 're rebuilding it for our money . 
  finally we agree on something !, 
   yes , the rainbow should be rebuilt for the-guys-who-burned-it 's money ( i.e. 
  namely the guy who torched it or organizers of the marsz niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci , during which it was burned deliberately and who were over the moon on the account of destroying it ) . 
   a rainbow , a symbol of the lgbt movement that 's what nationalists call it . 
  before they chose it as one of their main targets , it was just a rainbow for quite some time ( a year ? 
  two ? ), 
  -- completely normal , colourful piece of art on the street . 
  `` onet comments '' actually become an idiom . 
  ** poland ** : i 'm not really sure , as i try to ~ ~ ovid ~ ~ avoid reading comments on mainstream websites in order to remain sane ( they 're utterly stupid anyway ) . 
  however even i noticed that while at first most comments were pro-ukrainian and some were pro-russian or ambivalent ( `` ukrainians protesters are n't really better '' ) , at some point there was a sudden pike on pro-russian side . 
  ca n't say how big though . 
  edit : spelling, 
   nazi germany would never have been defeated without the russian/soviet effort and sacrifice . 
  true . 
  one could however argue that [ if not soviets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov\u2013ribbentrop_pact ) nazi germany would not be as big problem as it was in the first place . 
  edit : and that they [ were n't much better ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_crimes ) after wwii . 
  that was easy . 
  good luck with russians letting him out . 
  ** polish ** - bynajmniej - i 'm not sure if this counts though , as it can be translated as `` not in the least '' ( strongly emphacized ) , - ludowy / - a , ( for example : partia ludowa ) - as described by / u/golokigogo here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22g2s8/dear_reuropeans_which_words_from_the_english/cgn0g5u - most names of various mushrooms - we poles love to pick wild mushrooms in woods ( bigos and pierogi without wild mushrooms ? 
  and have names for most of them ( in many cases both official and common , folk names ) . 
  in engish most mushrooms does n't have a name and are known only by their latin name . 
  fun fact : boletus badius in ukraine , belarus and russia is known as ` polskiy gryb '' or `` polish mushroom '' . 
  not declined form , but yes it 's a derivative of this word . 
  literally `` smacznego '' means `` i 'm wishing you a tasty ( smaczny ) meal '' . 
  it 's like : - najlepszy = the best - wszystkiego najlepszego = i 'm wishing you all the best apparently in english there is a phrase '' [ enjoy your meal ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enjoy_your_meal ) '' which is close , but does n't mean exactly the same , as can only be said by someone who is not participating in the meal . 
  also , i find rather funny , it 's like `` have fun with your meal , you can build a castle out of mashed potatoes '' . 
   doba - twenty four hours . 
  you can also have a * martian doba * which is around 24 hours and 37 minutes , * mercurian doba * which is around 58 days 15 hours and 30 minutes , and so on . 
  better definition would be `` approximate * rotation period of the planet/moon/etc . '', 
  * ) earth actually rotates in 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds , that 's why we have leap years . 
  funny thing , in polish `` aleja '' is a ) a route among trees , b ) a wide street in the city . 
   kombinowa\u0107 in most cases it could be translated as `` to hack '' ( in a [ not pop-cultural , criminal sense ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hacker_ ( programmer_subculture ) ) , for example : - nie\u017ale to wykombinowa\u0142e\u015b = you hacked this neatly - kombinuj\u0119 jak to zrobi\u0107 = i 'm trying to put a hack on this it 's not exactly the same , but pretty close . 
  never heard of `` tumba '' and i ca n't find it used as you described ( [ 1 ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/tumba_ ( ujednoznacznienie ) ) , [ 2 ] ( http://sjp.pl/tumba ) ) , maybe it 's a regional thing ? 
  terrorist of my terrorist is my liberator ? 
  it 's a language rape to me . 
  same in poland i believe . 
  ** polish ** : - [ responsivity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsivity ) & mdash ; some people try to create a term `` responsywno\u015b\u0107 '' , but i find it ugly as fuck and have a hard time whenever i 'm trying to translate something with this word , - native speaker & mdash ; when one * really * have to translate this , usually goes with `` rdzenny u\u017cytkownik j\u0119zyka '' , literally `` native user of the language '' . 
  close enough , but not exactly the same, 
  wow , i love this sub already , thanks !, 
  in this case it actually can be translated :  nie ma zwyci\u0119zc\u00f3w , tylko ocalali yes , `` ocalali '' rubs my tongue the wrong way , but [ it is actuall word ] ( http://sjp.pl/ocalali ) . 
  agreed however that `` survivor '' is a hard case . 
  from the context of [ the article ] ( http://www.rp.pl/artykul/1098614-pakt-putin-obama.html ) , it 's the `` new iron curtain '' of some kind of second cold war . 
  in that sense it 's new . 
  rzeczpospolita http://www.rp.pl/artykul/1098614-pakt-putin-obama.html ( but yeah , that was my first guess too ), 
   crimea is merely within russia 's ` sphere of influence ' rather than within russia properly ? 
  as far poland ( and like all countries sans 5 ) is concerned crimea is only illegaly occupied by russia . 
  translation : - white stars : most important american military bases - blue : nato - red : russia - orange : countries that russia considers as it 's sphere of influence ( edit : belarus , ukraine and moldova ) - black line : a new dividing line, 
   the name `` dog '' has come from soviet computers dvk where the symbol had a short tail and similarity to a dog . 
  poland : @ is called `` ma\u0142pa '' , literally `` a monkey '' or `` an ape '' . 
   moscow is pressing nato to explain its plans to enhance its military presence in eastern europe  [ lavrov ] said russia had the right to move troops within its territory well , mr lavrov , nato has exactly the same right . 
  right ? 
  yep , they already did in 1945 . 
  and in xviii century . 
  i know , everything ca n't be returned overnight , thought it took some time since recognizing as belonging to poland ( `` late 90s '' ) to actually returning it . 
  but thankfully we 're moving forward with germans , now we need to talk with russians too . 
  and possibly swedes . 
  some of the stolen art . 
  some facts : - plans dates back to 1918 , - first preliminary works began in 1925 , but were dropped because of the great depression , - plans were revised in 1934 and work was to begin in late '30s , but wild world war appeared , - in 1950s works began again , and again were dropped because `` technical difficulties '' ( certainly not because communist government was broke !, 
  ) , - once more time we start to build first line in 1984 , but it took us some time : first * segment * of the line was opened in 1995 , the first line was finally finished in 2008 , - soon after , plans and work for second line began , some were saying it 's first segment was to be ready for euro 2012 ( those who visited warsaw back then , you may remember big constuction sites here and there ) , now it supposed to be opened later this year ( and i must say it may be possible ) . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/raketa-24h-ghiera-ore.jpg/480px-raketa-24h-ghiera-ore.jpg not ukrainian but russian though . 
  :d :d :d :d :d, 
  wow , there 's subreddit for everything !, 
  what now ? 
  was he the main nutter in right sector and it will get more civilized , or there are more similar nutters and right sector will get more radical , with him as a martyr ? 
  or perhaps they believe soviet propaganda that katy\u0144 is nazis work ? 
  edit : however after 1990 russians confirmed and acknowledged that it was soviets who killed in katy\u0144 , so we 're back to they 're batshit insane and messed it up . 
  if there were no funds , there would be nothing to steal . 
  ca n't you see , eu provoked them !, 
  so , where all the job stealin ' imigrants come from ? 
  this question probably deserves it 's own thread in / r/poland , but i 'll tell you already that if you 're in the area you ca n't miss the wieliczka salt mine : - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wieliczka_salt_mine - http://neveradulldayinpoland.com/time-to-visit-wieliczka-salt-mine-krakow-poland/, 
  74/7 ratio looks like a normal reddit auto-dv thing .

  while there certainly is corruption in poland , it 's not like you have to bribe everyone around you to live a normal life , thus `` seems '' . 
  i mean , have you tried to bribe a policemen to not give you a ticket recently ? 
  `` sir/ma ` am , do n't even start this conversation '' is probably best answer you might get . 
  doctors and hospital staff are even hesitant to receive a small tokens of appreciation like box of ptasie mleczko !, 
  someone may come to conclusion they ( young men and families of the `` hostages '' ) are bigger trouble makers at home together , than separated in barracks god knows where . 
  i feel like complaining about you complaining about our complaining . 
  ^ ( * edit : grammar , i hope * ), 
  and i guess all the tatars will be on the first line ? 
  but they ca n't conscript non-russian citizen , right ? 
  hopefully those who were less than enthusiastic about annexation wo n't be forced to take russian citizenship . 
  ukrainian law afaik does n't allow multiple citizenship . 
  source : ukrainian i know , though she told me this a few years ago . 
  is rakija in the package ?
