  then we have a deal . 
  what do they study ? 
  applied post-apocalyptic survival ? 
   die for their country a friendly tip : do n't die for your country , kill for your country . 
  and if russia was about to convince ukraine to join nato , it could n't do any better . 
  you 're not that wrong , only late a few centuries -- up to 1611 cracow was the capitol of poland . 
   polish sword ( `` szabla '' ) to be precise : it 's sabre . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szabla#hussar_szabla nice description . 
  and that does n't change the fact that after the battle , teutonic order never really recovered ( not that they did n't try , see 1519-21 war ) . 
  estonia traded all her cuteness for a swag . 
  afair they were `` shadow banned '' -- '' * we 've banned some people , but wo n't tell who exactly . 
  they 'll find out when they 'd want to go to russia * '' . 
  if there was an actual list in the first place of course , it 's possible that they just want to deny entry ad hoc . 
  teutonic order ( basically the synonym of the enemy ^ ( thunder rolling ) in poland ) - ever since the battle of grunwald / \u017dalgiris / tannenberg we ca n't really get along with them , can we ? 
  germany - except some older people ( for perfectly understandable reasons ) we get along quite good , 3 . 
  russia - i 've decided to leave it without comment . 
  rivals : - space . 
  well , they did take back moscow from us at one point . 
  interesting , they do n't seem to have any quarrels with mongols . 
  to be fair , moscow belonged to muscovites from the very beginning ( duh ) , and they did take it back from us -- the commonwealth -- at one point . 
  general warm-up food : - [ ros\u00f3\u0142 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ros\u00f3\u0142 ) ( chicken soup ) , - grzanka -- a mix of milk , butter , cocoa , honey and 96 % spirit ( ca n't remember full recipe , sorry ) . 
  for a soar throat : - [ kogel mogel with honey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kogel_mogel ) , - lemon with sugar : slice a whole lemon on a plate , sprinkle with quite a lot of sugar , wait 15-30 min for the lemon to release juice , and eat it . 
  i saw hoc on one of channels on cable . 
  however i prefer watching it ( and pretty much everything ) in original languag and netflix does n't want to shut up and take my money , i had to find , well , alternative sources . 
  i always giggle a little , as it also suits french stereotype . 
  but there is no such city as bielefeld ... 
  how does retirement looks like : - in france ? 
  a bottle of wine and all day with women . 
  - in uk ? 
  a bottle of whiskey and all day fishing . 
  - in poland ? 
  a bottle of pee and all day in queue to a doctor . 
  username checks out . 
  indeed they are . 
  in fact this is a poster of low budget sharknado remake . 
  been there , this place is beyond description . 
   there 's no elevation data in osm except height = and ele = keys . 
  like i said :  depends on the render . 
  and also i noted that one of them is available on osm.org . 
  while the data is not in osm 's database , it means -- in a sense -- that osm as a whole ( in this case slippy map tiles ) does include this information . 
  another pretty neat osm render : http://www.openmapsurfer.uni-hd.de, 
   what do you mean by that ? 
  open http://www.osm.org and click `` layers '' in the menu on the right . 
  or use http://www.osm.org/#layers=c  are you sure ? 
  as far as i remember srtm does n't include data above and below a certain latitude , whereas this dataset seem to cover the planet . 
  that 's what attribution on the map says `` map data : \u00a9 openstreetmap contributors , srtm '' . 
  besides srtm there is also aster gdem , which afaik has better coverage , however also has even worse than srtm data ( at least in my area of interest ) . 
  depends on the render . 
  cycle render on osm.org does include . 
  source of the elevation data is [ srtm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srtm ) . 
  while it 's best and most comprehend elevation data freely available , it 's quality is mediocre . 
  best elevation data comes from [ lidar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lidar ) scanning , however usually it 's not available for everyone . 
  and not everywhere . 
  and polish national epic [ pan tadeusz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_tadeusz ) begins with `` lithuania , my fatherland '' . 
   imagine if kaliningrad broke off from russia and named themselves warmian-masurian funny thing , because masuria actually `` stole '' it 's name . 
  historically [ masurians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/masurians ) were people living in the adjacent region of mazovia . 
  and things like [ mazurek cake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mazurek_ ( cake \\ ) ) or [ mazur dance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mazur_ ( dance \\ ) ) , usually associated with masuria because of the name , are actually mazovian tradition . 
  basically it 's like a walk in the forest , except with a purpose . 
  honestly , what 's wrong with that ? 
  i actually have a first hand experience in traveling in similar conditions . 
  back when i was in high school , we were going to a funeral of a parent of one of our classmates . 
  however we left the bus on a wrong end of the cemetery , and had a couple of kilometers to go . 
  luckily ( ? ), 
  a parent of another classmate saw us , and pulled over in a van used , i guess , to transport produce to a market . 
  while it was n't exactly a refrigeration truck , it was ( almost ) airtight , and i believe the only thing lacking for it to be a refrigeration truck was the refrigeration machine itself . 
  so we , about 20 or so teenagers , hopped into the back of the van . 
  the ride was awful !, 
  it was perfectly dark , so you could n't even see your own hand . 
  there was nothing to hold to , so it was like a rather wild rollercoaster , except there was no seatbelts and you were standing . 
  and near the end , after only ** 2 maybe 3 minutes ** , air was really heavy . 
  i honestly ca n't imagine having to travel like that for a dozens of kilometers , not to mention hundreds . 
  except now they know he 's * still * there . 
  also known as hipster islands . 
  you mean ... that they were slow at it ? 
  i was wondering who hitherto is ... 
  ^ ( [ citation needed ] ), 
  i wonder if it has some secret protocol ... 
  i love the couple in the background . 
  at 1:05 they 're just standing there , and once kingpin bites through the can they 're like `` the fuck ? 
  we 're outta here '' . 
  i wonder if there are some perls among the `` gems and another valuable treasure '' . 
  i heard it 's still not fully explored , and from time to time people discover something new . 
  [ riese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_riese ) is another possible candidate . 
   poland is densely populated , you ca n't just loose a train without anyone stumbling upon it in few months . 
  it must be somewhere underground in a caved in tunnel . 
  almost certainly it 's somewhere in [ mru ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/festungsfront_oder-warthe-bogen ) . 
  in the labirynths of this underground fortifications you could successfully hide not one , but a dozen of trains . 
  meh , witcher 3 has been released , i 'm good . 
  for our foreign friends , it 's common folk ( ? ), 
  song : * vistula is flowing on the polish land as long as it flows poland shall not perish . 
  * ~ ~ hl3 ~ ~ ww3 confirmed . 
   poles are sort of like the mexicans of europe . 
  funny thing you said that , because we actually have a catchphrase `` poland is the mexico of europe '' . 
  thanks !, 
  you 're baltic ~ ~ s ~ ~ in denial . 
  `` this sanctioned geese is dead '' . 
  `` no , it 's not . 
  it 's just resting '' . 
  not spectacular enough . 
  also , flowers are 124 % contaminated with gay .
