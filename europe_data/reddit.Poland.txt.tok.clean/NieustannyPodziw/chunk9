  but still . 
  psssst , i thought we 're on the same side . 
  fun fact : few years ago candidates running for a city mayor in poland were playing sim city during campaign .

  all polish girls are ugly and crazy , and everyone should stay away from them for their own good .

  in poland we have a proverb `` the first million got to be stolen '' . 
  i 'd like to elaborate on kowalski ( - ska ) / kowalczyk -- first one was a surname for an actual smith , second one for smith 's helper . 
  same rule aplies for other similar surnames , like m\u0142ynarski / m\u0142ynarczyk -- miller/miller 's helper , kucharski/kucharczyk -- cook/cook 's helper . 
  sadly they did n't . 
  that was an accident . 
  the only reason he passed the electoral threshold was an extremely low turnout ( < 24 % ) . 
  please do n't mind this lunatic . 
  politically he does n't really exists , even if a devoted vocal minority on certain social networks makes an impression it 's otherwise . 
  he actually was successful in elections only twice , and one could say both occurrences were an accident : - first in 1991 , when there was no electoral threshold and every party had a seat , even if only one ( his party had 3 ; for comparison purely satirical [ polish beer-lovers ' party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers'_party ) had 16 ) , - and second in 2014 , when there was an extremely low turnout ( < 24 % ) and the usual 2-3 % turned out to be 7 % .

  fdisk ca n't fix the eastern bad block . 
  komorowski 's friends likes to hunt , so they vote for him . 
   but seriously correlation between wildlife and election is bullshit . 
  it 's correlation between partitions ( actually marked on the `` boars map '' ) and other stuff . 
   no , but a big component of humour is something being unexpected , especially in political or social commentary jokes . 
  if it 's edgy / taboo / controversial , it can also make it funnier . 
  sounds like paul and storm 's lecture [ the correlation of humour and context in modern american satire ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8-uc-7tmpw&amp;t=10m ) . 
  this statement is valid for basically everything .

  if anyone is interested in current situation and/or wants to help : - http://kathmandulivinglabs.org/blog/nepal-earthquake-report-from-openstreetmap-situation-room/ - http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2015_nepal_earthquake - / r/openstreetmap/comments / 33uchc/earthquake _ in_nepal_how_you_can_help /, 
   just a fyi , it 's `` nepalese '' . 
  thanks !, 
  yes , if the quake happened only a couple months ago , the situation would be even worse . 
  fortunately by now katmandu itself is mapped quite good , and there are people in place already experienced in mapping , working tirelessly ( [ kathmandu living labs ] ( https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/kathmandu_living_labs ) ' own building has been damaged in the quake and at first they were working outside using solar batteries ) to improve maps in other affected areas . 
  on a side , but somehow related , note : nepal is a bit `` backward '' gis-wise -- they do n't have good maps , most of the houses do n't have a ~ ~ name ~ ~ number , most of the streets do n't have a name ( when you send a letter , you send it to a post office near addressee , and addressee must check post office every now and then if there is something for them , it literally is a postal hell ) . 
  ~ ~ nepalish ~ ~ nepalese government is filling this blank space using openstreetmap to create modern maps ( here you can see [ the very first detailed map of one of kathamndu 's districts ] ( https://www.facebook.com/kathmandulivinglabs/photos/pcb.1588489761365051/1588489524698408/?type=1&amp;theater ) made using osm ) , and at the same time attach addresses to places . 
  to help with that , a delegation of polish osm community has been invited few months ago to share know-how and experience : - https://www.facebook.com/kathmandulivinglabs/photos/pcb.1584150211799006/1584148511799176/?type=1&amp;theater - https://www.facebook.com/kathmandulivinglabs/photos/pcb.1583372265210134/1583371828543511/?type=1&amp;theater what many may not know , osm has a special [ humanitarian team ] ( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/humanitarian_osm_team ) that creates a map used by humanitarian workers in cases of natural distasters [ like this one ] ( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2015_nepal_earthquake ) -- because a map is essential to deliver the humanitarian aid , you need to know where for example residential areas , roads and open spaces to land a helicopter are . 
  quite a few polish mappers , including those who visited in nepal few months ago , are now doing what they can to help : http://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?pid=499490#p499490 according to marek kleciak , one of the mappers who has a contact with dr. nama budhatoki , head of nepal osm community -- the katmandu living labs , the situation in place is grave , they lack food , water and fuel . 
  kill bill 's sequel . 
  somehow [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uaz9pzr.jpg ) reminds me [ this ] ( http://www.toonopedia.com/yogi.jpg ) . 
  sure , it 's not near as bad as photo of ( pro- ) russian separatist entering an osce car few months ago . 
  however , call me paranoid , but i believe that sides of the conflict absolutely should not have an access to osce vehicle at all , especially to an unattended one . 
  what may look like an innocent selfie to impress one 's girlfriend , could also be a stunt to plant a bug or sabotage osce 's work in some other way . 
  first i laughed , but then i realized it makes a lot of sense to attach a substitute of balls to a substitute of penis . 
   your score : 76 % 03:05 damn it , balkans and moldova !, 
   your score : 56 % 1:41 in a few cases however it was a matter of english names . 
  i mean , how can i know which river , rhine or rhone , it the one we call ren ? 
  `` if one have money , they have it from * somewhere * '' . 
  and responding to `` polish '' attack on russia is third thing . 
  see my [ gliwice radio station ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gliwice_radio_tower#history ) reference . 
  reasonably speaking it 's very highly unlikely . 
  still , it 's better to be prepared for russia to go full retard . 
  i mean , poland and russia has a history , and who knows when we 're going to treacherously attack russian radio station in gliwice or wherever . 
  he 's not . 
  - we [ ( almost ) successfully `` damnatio-memoriaed '' one of the rulers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boles\u0142aw_the_forgotten ) - [ orp orze\u0142 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orp_orze\u0142_ ( 1938 \\ ) #loss ) has been sunk by allied navy ( probably dutch submarine or birtish then not yet charted minefield ) in accident , however british hid this fact afraid of polish reaction -- as orze\u0142 was a legend , see orze\u0142 incident : [ p1 ] ( http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2007/08/tales-of-the-sea-the-orzel-incident ) , [ p2 ] ( http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2007/09/tales-of-the-sea-the-orzel-incident-part-ii ) , [ p3 ] ( http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2007/11/tales-of-the-sea-the-orzel-incident-part-iii ) ( sadly ca n't find any mention of that in english ) - [ everyone is a jew ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polonica.net ) , or at least russian/german agent ( especially top politicians ) , or preferably both - we can not into space , when we [ clearly can ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros\u0142aw_hermaszewski ), 
  just say `` polish death camps '' already and call it a day . 
  a redditor for one day , ca n't say i 'm surprised . 
  you probably should 've spend one more day to do some research . 
  and i probably should just ignore you , but hell . 
  yes , polish people did murder jews during wwii . 
  we do n't deny this blood on our hands ( excluding nutters , but nutters gon na nut ) . 
  probably one of the biggest pogroms conducted by polish people was [ in jedwabne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jedwabne_pogrom ) -- at least 340 jews perished there . 
  it was n't of course only one , and for sure there were many individual cases . 
  in total i 'd say probably a total number of few thousand of jews were indeed murdered by poles . 
  you suggest that it was rather few millions ? 
  let me remind you that total number of 6 milions jews were killed in holocaust . 
  let 's say that by `` few millions '' you say `` 2-3 millions '' -- in other words you claim that at least every third or second jew was killed by a pole ( even those killed elsewhere ) . 
  that 's quite a statement . 
  also , let me remind you that poles are the largest national contingent among righteous among the nations . 
  who knows , maybe [ irena sandler ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irena_sendler ) single handedly saved more jews than were murdered by poles during wwii ?

  thank you . 
  hopefully a day will come , when both our countries can move past our dark past towards bright future . 
  to be fair in 1991 prosecutor general 's office `` confirmed soviet responsibility for the massacres '' . 
  politicians apparently needed some time to catch up . 
  yay . 
  and china , you too . 
  it seems that japanese have some interests in poland .
