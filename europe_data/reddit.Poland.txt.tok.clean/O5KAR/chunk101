   china , india , russia/soviet very * bright examples * ... 
  and that 's why i was n't trying to say that . 
  except that these were n't multietchnic states with army of multilingual people waiting for the collapse of a country to fulfill their * nationalist * ambitions . 
  besides , there is n't even will to defend european borders from illegall immigration , crime and growing redicalism in some ghettos was was the same tolerated for years and everybody ignored threats and provocations from russia until they invaded ukraine ... how can i trust my security to this kind of incompetent people , driven by insane , irrational ideology ? 
  do n't think so , i was clearly talking about newspapers and afaik it 's not confusing in english . 
   more efficient like in austria-hungary . 
  i know too little about spanish politics to judge it , but i just hope that communism is only bad memory . 
  i knew that they 've had some connections with venezuela ( and iran ) so that was my guess . 
  the thing about iran is obviously bullshit , but these are the ** anti ** ballitic missiles , it 's a defensive system . 
  as for the range , open the map and look at kaliningrad , there 're the actual nuclear capable missiles and other that covers whole poland and parts of germany but anyway it 's really not far from here to russia . 
  this system is also ineffective against russian mirvs like topol-m and their nuclear arsenal is worlds biggest so it 's not even possible to defend from it . 
  i was listening to that conferrence on rt and he said more or less that but it 's clear anyway and it 's not the first time . 
  russia exercise with belarus every year since a long time and the scenarios of these drills includes nuclear strike on warsaw or rebellion of the polish minority and its supression . 
  russia aims weapons at poland at least since it joined nato and it 's recently getting more and more arrogant , openly threatening with nuclear missiles also the neutral countries like sweden and finnland . 
  you mean podemos ? 
  venezuela should be studied along the other countrues how ** not ** to govern . 
  we studied that for about 40 years and it ended just like in venezuela , except that many ... many people died . 
  people should finally learn from others mistakes to not repeat them and i do n't care about any excuses , if it is or was the `` real '' communism or not . 
  so the problem is that i 've called guardian and similar papers `` leftist rags '' , but it 's not a problem that they just lie and manipulate about bia\u0142owie\u017ca ? 
  i do n't get you people , but keep downvoting if that helps you ... 
  he do n't have to say exactly the same to the point , the idea of a threat is that you 're telling a country that it will face some consequences if it does something or does n't do . 
  second strike is not a defensive mechanism , it 's a deterrent . 
   limit capabilities of enemy 's nuclear forces sounds great . 
  why would n't russia make its own abm ? 
  they seems to have anti aircraft systems and i 'm sure that also anti missile , just of a different kind . 
  nobody seems to feel thretened by someone elses defences . 
  everybody knows how russia will react you still do n't get it that the point here is what they say , not what they do . 
  nobody use this kind of language and thretens with use of nuclear weapons , nobody except for putin and kim jong-un . 
  so you know how thretening looks like , now tell me how are the words of putin and his `` diplomats '' any different ? 
  ... you 're calling nuclear missiles defensive ? 
  let me guess , the abm is offensive according to you ? 
  anyway that 's no preparation , it 's just talk and it serves nothing realistic , only emotions . 
  that 's not what russians say and you know it . 
  so what did they done with these ? 
  was there some nuclear war that i 've missed ? 
  it is but you do n't have to tell it every week , especially if he says that these rockets will be aimed when they already are , that 's clearly a threat and if you ca n't see it then you must be blind but every country that was thretened so far sees it differently . 
   imaginary leftists very funny . 
  you just ca n't stand that i 'm labelling guardian and similar papers as `` leftist '' , no idea why you have a problem with that , but that 's just your problem . 
  you seems to not mind their obvious lies and manipulations but i do and when they 'll be spreading misinformations then i 'll be showing up with my rants . 
  i 'm sure that the whole sub is very grateful for your services , have an upvote as a reward . 
  russia thretens its neighbours ... how 's that any news ? 
  i would n't care less . 
  ok so how 's that related to your butthurt or how does it show that you are n't really hurt in here ? 
  i agree even in this particular case that 's a bad decission , but how is that or my `` national pride '' related to the lies and manipulations of leftist rags ? 
  i hope they have , but do you see them running their mouths and thretening russian `` allies '' ? 
  there 's absolutelly no other point here , it 's not even a speech directed at us , but rather for the russian public to believe that their beloved leader will defend them . 
  it makes no difference if russia ads a one more target for its missiles or replace tochka with iskander in kaliningrad . 
  sure we can and will do whatever we wants and moscow can do that too , but when they provoke and threaten their neighbours they should n't be surprised about `` russophobic '' . 
  it 's just counter productive , unless kremlin really wants to escalate the tensions . 
  ... a newspaper is nobody 's mother , it 's not even a person . 
  excuse me this language but i think that this kind of lies and manipulations deserves far worse description . 
  so when and who was i calling names here ? 
  please report me if i was offending someone ... and since when is `` leftist '' an insult ? 
  the nukes are not aimed just since now and the point here is that russia is just thretening and provoking and then whine that nobody likes her ... 
  comparing cuba is just funny because we 're not talking about offensive missiles here and there 're these in europe anyway , it 's a much different enviroment , political situation and even technology today . 
   conquer canada 200 years ago ancient history . 
  that was an actual nuclear missile , not anti ballistic missiles and if you still do n't know it , then there 're actual nuclear weapons in europe and distance to moscow is not really bigger than from cuba to wasgington dc . 
  maybe it is a bit , but also i ca n't do nothing about that and it 's also not such a tragedy like it 's pictured . 
  many forests are being logged and many are planted in poland , the balance is positive but in general i 'd want it to be better for several reasons , also practical like balance of water ( floods ) and absorbtion of carbon . 
  i do n't even remember you , but i 'm glad you 're an optimist . 
  oh and thanks for a downvote , that surely helps your point . 
  if you really needs that to feel better then i 'm going to upvote you since now on . 
  rags , thanks for pointing that out . 
  should i just lie like these guys to be taken seriously ? 
  i 'm sorry if you feel that `` leftist '' is an offensive word or a taboo . 
  do i hear butthurt ? 
  except that it 's just a speculation , or accusation if you prefere of some biased newspaper . 
  i 'm not defending the man , but he 's not a demon that his `` friends '' are picturing him . 
  you know that there 're different scientists with different opinions ? 
  it 's not the way that leftists are picturing it , that * everyone * is opposing this policy and * foresters * are n't just some uneducated pesants . 
  sure , do what you feel is right , just do n't lie because you 're going to hurt your own cause like in case of this campaign ... which i think serves nothing else but cynical damage of the country and forest international image for some petty political fight against the current gov. 
  you may believe in honest intentions of these people , but i think that actuall scientists and eniromentalists are just exploited here . 
  * pyh\u00e4-h\u00e4kki national park - 13 km2 * bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest - 3,085.8 km2 ( 1,418.85 km2 - national park ) yeah , i feel so silly ... do you actually undertstand that we 're talking about europe and not asia ? 
  nemtsov was nobody , sorry but he had no popular support and i do n't even know why he was murdered . 
  the only alternative in there is actuallt a communist party , if it is n't just controlled by fsb like the others , which is quite funny ... 
  that 's not what i mean . 
  i mean that the same as russia you lost purpose , ideology and a `` mission '' . 
  today * democracy * is a mockery and * freedom * sounds like a joke , moscow managed to picture freedom house and `` color revolutions '' as something worse than the actual dictators ( usually post communist moscow puppets ) that they 're trying to replace . 
  in many fields you 're loosing the propaganda war ( but not just you , the whole `` western '' world is ) to some well paid and organised but just a state funded television . 
  your actions are clumsy , ineffective and often counterproductive , unless we assume that chaos was intended . 
  you 're opening multiple fronts at once and you ca n't hold them even if they drain your pockets and when you thinks that something was solved ( like iraq ) so it 's the time to call victory and move out then there 's exploding another , even worse crisis which is also partly a side effect of yout incometent policy ( unless again that was intended ) . 
  i 'm trying to understand russia so do n't hate me , but especially because you 're the evil american it sounds like hypocrisy ... well , it is because many people were disposed or harrased because of speaking disallowed things , like snowden or assange , both serving the positive image of russia and negative of usa . 
  there were attacked several states for none or very unclear reasons and separatist movements created or armed ... maybe you just got too comfortable after the bankrupcy of commnism and collapse of soviet empire ? 
  for moscow there 's no poroblem with disorganised , soft and `` gay '' europe , but rather with nato , or america to be precise . 
  there 's no such guy in russia to elect , they 're all like putin or worse . 
  edit : oh thank you guys for your love , lets pretend all of that never happened and everything 's just going well , just downvote me for trying to understand our russian `` partners '' ... murica fuck yeah !, 
  done everything and still ca n't understand how russians are able to switch from symparthy to hatred in a minute just because their best leader and his propaganda tells them that it 's a hunting season for ukrainians ... 
  i mean , every country has some gov , some better or worse media , but everywhere there 's some opposition , criticism , any kind of discussion while in russia it 's just a religion of the best leader and opposition to the `` enemies '' . 
  also that victim complex is really annoying , grow some balls . 
  yeah , big money grab of infected wood and i 'm deluding myself ... dude , i do n't like this idea , i 'd even prefere to leave the whole forest as it is because the only reason the bark beatle devastates it is an artificial , human planted monoculture of spruce tree . 
  let it rot and the new trees wil grow in there in ... the next century . 
  what i do n't like is a cynical brainwashing and fearmongering for clearly political reasons because the actual primeval forest is not going to be touched and all the leftist rags are running their mouths like it 's some apocalypse . 
   plenty of old growth forests still around in europe no , sorry but this one is serious , the others are more like parks than forests . 
  when i see clear lies in leftist medias , when a one is quoting another to the point with every single false word without checking then i say it 's a lefitist , political campaign . 
  feel free to prove me wrong and if you do n't know what i 'm talking about then i 'd gladly link all of that shitposting on reddit in recent days . 
  ... you have no idea what i was writing about , what 's a danger for which forest and from whose perspective . 
  do you even know what 's a primeval forest and why is it unique , what 's the difference between a `` regular '' and this forest ? 
  if you 're seriously asking , that 's only the part of the forest that is quite new and was cut all the time bit after bit . 
  no , sorry dude , it does n't work like that . 
  the frequency of r1a1 marker does not make you any more or less `` slavic '' .
