  i was commenting these articles when they appeared here , not just me because it 's debated in poland since few months , my opinion is just that some leftists wants to exploit ignorance of foreigners and make them think that the polish `` fascists '' just destroys the last primeval forest in europe because they 're greedy , stupid demons . 
  the question is what 's `` essential '' and for what ? 
  a forest is a one ecosystem , no matter if a one part is primeval and the other was just planted 200 years ago ( the oldest parts , according to local medias ) , the nature does n't really care where we put a border of a national park . 
  the forest in czechia was not primeval , this one is located next to primeval forest and that makes it also important , so lets not make it even more confusing ... ok ? 
  as i 've said in the other comment , the bark beatle attacks it exactly because it 's an artificial monoculture of a spruce tree , a real diversed forest would not be destroyed by a single `` pest '' and this insect would not spread because of lacking food . 
  you should understand the difference between the whole bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest and a national park , which is covering the primeval forest . 
  the national park by definition ca n't be managed and nobody wants to violate these tules . 
  the issue is with quite new trees , a modern part of the forest that was always managed by every government so the recent outrage seems to be quite fake , related to the recent elections and just `` political '' . 
  the only new and really controversial thing is the scale , number of trees that will be cut down . 
  the argument of foresters and gov is a plague of bark beatle and it 's nothing uncommon to cut down the infected trees in order to ave the healthy ones . 
  it 's not the natural way , but also the forest is not `` natural '' ( primeval ) and it 's another issue because it 's mostly a monoculture of a spruce tree that was planted some time ago and it 's also the reason why bark beatle spreads there , a low biodiversity . 
   chemtrails yeah , funny story , some years ago he asked a minister about it ... a politician said or did something stupid , shocking !, 
  the guy is not just nobody , he 's actually a professor of forestry and he was a minister in three different goverments . 
  he did not just disregarded , but dismissed most of the members of the state council of enviroment protection and that is a really bad thing . 
  it 's a nice place and please do n't believe these articles ... the primeval forest is not being cut down . 
  it 's our national treasure and people would never allow anybody to cut a single tree in there , not to mention that it 's a national park , unesco world heritage site and area protected by eu . 
  it 's a one of a kind place on our continent . 
  i 'm not arguing in favour of logging , actually i 'd prefere to have as many unmanaged forests as possoible in poland , but i say that the recent campaign was misleading , manipulative and just made for political reasons . 
  it 's just wrong to exploit ignorance of foreigners and write alarimist articles that polish gov is actually cutting down the last primeval forest in europe . 
  there ca n't be any discussion based on lies . 
  sure , it 's actually funny and i hope that nobody takes it seriously as well . 
  it 's bad that it was publicized with a false reason , there 're circulating exactly the same articles from many sources about that the actual primeval forest is going to be cut down by a crazy , fascist gov. . . 
  i guess that 's a good thing according to you , especially if you 're so eager to threaten minister . 
  ends justify the means , right ? 
  it 's so f. . . ing sad that instead of a civil and reasonable discussion based on arguments we have a lot of cynical propaganda which looks like a made up campaign against some politicians . 
  this is actually the first english speaking thread that does not treat people like complete idiots and says that it 's about the whole ecosystem , which includes the not so `` ancient '' forest . 
  pity that 's just your comment while you 're still using manipulations in the lead and i do n't mean that most of these `` animals '' ( species i guess ) are anthropod . 
  the primeval forest is in no danger , the question is about a forest that surrounds it and creates a one ecosystem . 
  it was planted and logged many times , like most of forests in europe , the problem now is that quite bigger part of it will be cut down , there 's the plague of bark beatle and some people wanted to protect it since many years ... not to mention that there 's the evil demonic government and every reason is good to fight it . 
  i wish it would be possible , but i 'm afraid that poland is still quite poor , also czech rep. is much richer and it seems to not help lusatia or saxony . 
  well , the results for poland / poles are quite bad already , no idea how could that be affected by result of elections . 
  honestly , i 'm also surprised by this map , or a bit ashamed . 
   so they sent troops to the area again , held the elections , and conscripted soldiers from the contested territory for their army . 
  the troops , or rather police was there since quite a bit of time and that was not protested by the czechoslovak gov. 
  the `` army '' that you fought there was improvised group of volunteer miners , students and scouts . 
  elections were n't held because of invasion . 
  czechoslovak forces occupied also spisz and orawa in december . 
  it looks to me that czechoslovakia just exploited chaos and wars that poland was involved in to take coal resources and important railriod connection to slovakia . 
  and what else was that invasion if not desregarding treaties ? 
  the only reason these elections would not be in line with the treaty is that there was just temporary administration , but the whole conflict from the beginning was because czechoslovakia wanted area populated by polish majority claiming some historical reasons . 
  lets be honest , many poles have this inferiority complex towards western europe and superiority complex towards eastern . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the autocomplete results ? 
  i do n't even think that it 's `` racism '' and there 're negative or positive stereotypes about each and every nation , so i do n't really mind , but it was just my guess why would it be popular in search autocomplete . 
  also , as many people pointed out the results are due to different use of '' * nation * jest '' and '' * nation * to '' , both are technically the same but the second one is easier for insults and negative adjectives , just more `` primitive '' . 
  that 's the most idiotic excuse for a war that i 've ever heard about ... ok , maybe except for [ football war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_war ) . 
  why it was even a problem for czechoslovakia ? 
  correct , in this way i see some of these results , but i 'd never google something in this way . 
   poland to annex a part of our country along with germany before ww2 that was nasty and wrong , our president already apologised and nobody thinks that was good , but what people do n't know is the other part of the story when czechoslovakia attacked us in 1919 ... 
  it 's autocomplete , not search results and it seems really , really strange ... 
  i find it pretty funny that you thinks they 're racist even if there was n't such accusations ... yet . 
  no idea about these search autocomplete results , but i can only guess that it was about `` racism '' against polish people . 
  lol ... my google shows quite different results at least as for few countries / people i 've chceked . 
  are you sure that it was not fixed somehow or affected by authors ' search history ? 
   un-bluehelm observers what ?!, 
  the so called `` referendum '' was organised under the occupation of armed soldiers without distinctions but it was clear that they 're russian soldiers , which was finally [ admitted ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31796226 ) by putin . 
  it was just an invasion , the `` observers '' of that referendum were some exotic politicians corrupted by russia . 
  the only countries that recognized annexation of crimea are syria , venezuela , cuba , nicaragua , afghanistan and north korea ... why do n't you read something about a subject that you 're trying to talk about ? 
  you obviously do n't know even basic facts . 
  not yanukovych because he own no base or a country , it was agreement between ukraine and russia , it was also signed for some time and it was not the first of such agreements . 
  what kind of `` discussion '' with greece and how does all of it justify invasion of ukraine and annexation of crimea ? 
  pi\u0142sudski was not the only man in charge and he was still better than his sucessors . 
  the post wwi wars and border conflicts were mutual , negotiations with western ukraine were impossible , these people rejected any compromise or cooperation after the war and if you mran petlura then it was just impossible to defeat red army with no or very little support of local ukrainians . 
  not sure what do you mean with `` my description '' , i agree that there were many wrong and anti yktainian actions and policies and i agree that it contributed to hatred and negative sentiments . 
  i just do n't agree that ukrainians were treated like `` property '' as you 've said and i do n't think that masscres of civiilan population is a fight for independence ... 
  i 'm not eleiminating it actually , but you can have a sovereign state with etchnic minorities ... and separatism , etchnic issues and problems , just like it was in poland . 
  there were not so many poles in volhynia actually , much more of them lived in podolia and especially red ruthenia . 
  if you mean by `` goothold '' the settlement policy , then it was barely few thousands soldiers which were granted lands as a reward for military service , especially in the polish - bolshevik war . 
  i do n't need to repeat anything , i just disagree with your opinion that this was a fight against the people that `` claimed '' disputed territories while they just lived there and since quite a long time . 
   orb\u00e1n found a way to play ball with brussels and stay in the mainstream european people 's party group . 
   managed to do it for years when poland was ruled by donald i just forgot to add that 's sarcasm , or it was just donald who was the useful idiot of orban for all of these years . 
  edit : i see some * dumb idiots * are downvoting , so let me make it easier for you to understand ... poland was ruled by donald for about ** eight ** years , until last autumn , hungary is ruled by orban since ** six ** years so if the evil and terrible victator played ball with brussels for ** six ** years and polish gov was his `` useful idiot '' then it was the gov of tusk , whose party is also in epp . 
  pesants made no rules , before xixc not even the present national identity existed . 
  nobility was considering itself `` polish '' and pesantry was `` masurian '' ( mazurzy ) . 
  i agree there was a lot of bad blood and neither side was innocent but it 's really just a myth or propaganda that every pole is a rich and opressive `` lord '' . 
  assimilation of ruthenian nobility was a process that took a long time , nobody was mistreating and assimilating people because of religion or etchnicity in first republic , unless we consider the union of brest and formation of unite church . 
  galicia was a part of poland for many centuries and it was n't really assimilated , rather mixed because of natural process . 
  germans also were n't just forcing assimilation of silesia , only a bit of pommerania sometimes , at least until pyussia conquared it in late xviiic . 
  yes , i absolutelly understand the ambitions of ukrainians for sovereignty and self determination , i can even understand the * rationale * behind etchnic cleansing but it 's not what you say ... upa did not fought ak , if it would then nobody should complain . 
  it was an attempt to exploit chaos and war to alter the etchnic composition of disputed and mixed areas , it was not about independence . 
  it happened , it 's history and now you have quite different problems while the polish politics and society are very supportive of ukraine , but also distrustful . 
  yes , i 'm dumb and you was just reported . 
   ** orb\u00e1n ** found a way to play ball with brussels and stay in the mainstream european people 's party group , while still striking an often defiant tone at home . 
  learn to read . 
  same in poland , but in recent elections they got smarter and joined some other party so they 've managed to introduce whole five mps ... 
  some people are just this kind of `` liberal federalists '' like rosa luxembourg or felix dzier\u017cy\u0144ski . 
  serfdom was abolished in 1848 in austria and in 1861 in russia . 
  it was not an etchnic issue and i 'm sorry that most of ukrainian nobility assimilated to some other cultures , but imagine that not all of the poles were `` szlachta '' , actually most of them were just pesants ... 
  this was often exploited by austria and then by the communists to use it for their political interests , like it was with [ galician slaughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galician_slaughter ) or soviet deportations and repressions after invasion of poland . 
  ok , i knew that , but to say that ukrainians were treated as property in second republic is just wrong . 
  the social and economic issues contributed to the differences but oun-upa was usually attacking also farmers , not any `` nobility '' , not even towns . 
  wait , did i accused someone of something ? 
  it 's enough i 've read some polish sources , i know what was going on before , during and after the war . 
  i see , thanks . 
  sorry , i do n't know ukrainian and it would take me weeks to read and understand it . 
  anyway i know that many policies of second republic towards minorities were n't nice , but do n't be overdramatic . 
  nobody was killing ukrainians or the others and if so , then it was a typical murder , punishable by law . 
  the anti ukrainian policies were usually reaction to terrorism and harassment of local polish population by nationalists from oun , like it was in case of that `` pacification '' but it could not resolve the clear and deep etchnic differences , it only made uktainians to hate us even more . 
  if that 's one sided point of view then i 'm sorry , but i ca n't equate some nasty political repressions to a full scale etchnic cleansing . 
  still ukrainians lived better in poland than in the soviet ukraine where millioins died from hunger or repressions just like many other soviet people .
