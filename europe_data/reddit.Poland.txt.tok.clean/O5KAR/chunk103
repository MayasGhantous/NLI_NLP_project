  that 's interesting , what 's the source of this data and map ? 
   according to polish historian w\u0142adys\u0142aw pob\u00f3g-malinowski , there were no fatalities , [ 9 ] while , according to ukrainian historian p. mirchuk , 35 ukrainian civilians died during the pacification . 
  s. horak estimates the number of victims at 7 . 
  [ 10 ] it was one way . 
  poland wanted to deal with ukrainian nationalists and terrorists , not to commit an etchnic cleansing . 
  pacification was wrong , too brutal and its effects were opposite from intended , but it ca n't excuse the actual genocide commited by the ukrainian chavinists . 
  he signed an agreement with opposition parties in presence of russian ambassador with german and polish fm and french deputy fm . 
  anyway how some internal political issues of a one country justyfies invasion of another ? 
  we all know that yanukovych was a puppet , but ukraine was a sovereign , separate state and not a rebelled province of russia . 
  lets not make it a case of religious freedom ... sure people can do whatever they wants , they can harm themselfs for all i care , but the state should never consider magic as equal to medicine . 
  no , they did not , there 's just no more soviet citizenship and these people did n't qualify or refused to get the latvian or estonian citizenship . 
  i can imagine that , but it 's also just dangerous to consider the alternative `` medicine '' as actuall medicine . 
  yes , it 's a disgrace and actually very dangerous policy of ukrainian gov , but what 's your point ? 
  these people were organised , armed and send to fight only ** after ** the russian invasion and breakout of the armed separatis rebellion in donbas . 
  in every country there 're punks like that and everywhere they 're a little , extreme minority . 
  so it was ukraine which invaded russia , annexed part of its territory , made up and armed separatists . 
  now i see that russia is just defending ... / s they did no such thing in latvia and estonia and i do n't care about a one of thousands proposals which never were passed by parliament . 
  yeah , sounds reasonable ... unless the kids are involved by thier idiot parents . 
  there were few cases like that in poland , some witch `` doctors '' and parents were arreseted . 
  the recent idea was a `` pox party '' where idiots met with a one infected kid to `` vaccinate '' the healthy ones , one of them died . 
  it looks to me that some serious lobby convinced swiss to vote like that . 
  yeah sure , the legendary `` russophobia '' ... 
  it 's hard to protest against ukrainian soverignty and support armed separatist junta which is absolutelly normal and would not be tolerated anywhere else . 
  not even in britain or spain where separatist movements are peacefull , at least since ira and eta were neutralised . 
  edit : jokes aside , there 's some anti russian sentiment and it can be manifested violently sometimes , it ca n't be excused by the anti ukrainian policy of the russian gov , but that 's the reason . 
  more like hundrests of thousands . 
  i do n't mind ukrainian `` refugees '' , especially if they passed some tests of polish to get that card . 
  wow a one tiny spot where polish survived massacres and expulsions ... 
  the russian speaking area in donetsk and luhansk oblasts covers these separatist puppet states more or less . 
  it must be hard to be ukrainian there . 
  i guess he was talking about osce which was doing some [ strange ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-osce-staff-at-separatist-wedding/27660759.html ) things . 
  incredible , he managed to do it for years when poland was ruled by donald . 
  orban is a genius ... 
  yeah , the question is who gets slovakia ... joking , it 's quite a / r/shittymappprn . 
  wft switzerland ? 
  are n't people dying because of these quacks ? 
  which is not internationalist , conservative , protectionist ... and incompetent , overdramatic , comical , but that 's another problem . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  there 're tons of articles in polish , but even the most radical leftist papers do n't dare to lie in such a pathetic way . 
  these articles in foreign press are directed to the foreigners which knows nothing about bia\u0142owie\u017ca and ca n't tell a difference between a primeval and regular forest that was logged every year ... 
  there was a bit [ more ] ( https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/results.aspx?chart=country&amp;search=poland ) but unfortunatelly gtd seems outdated . 
  i 'd consider also ryszard cyba , but who cares , they all deserves it for `` dividing '' people or something . 
  it was also posted with a link to guardian , something else was on / r/worldnews , all of these are like copies of the same text and they 're just fat lies ... 
  someone really works hard on this smear campaign . 
  what about brunon kwiecie\u0144 ? 
  i 've seen many creative people in poland , but these conspiracy theories are just like under the tyranny of po and apparently `` serious '' journalists or politicians usually talks the same , depends on what serves who . 
  not to mention a one who proposed that heroic kod to act like ... hamas . 
  aha , it 's a conspiracy !, 
  you 're repeating yourself and still talking about me . 
  who cares ? 
  you was talking bullshit , as usually and ignored the issue here just to get into some personal attacks , now you 're going even further with some unrealted politicial issues to insult even more people , but nobody really give a f. . . about the homo martyrology and your constant whining . 
  so yeah , grow a thicker skin . 
  so it 's suddently a `` viewpoint '' if a forest is primeval or not and lies are `` criticism '' now ... that 's so `` progressive '' . 
  you 're right , i should n't complain when some leftist rag disrespects my country and clearly lies to its misguided readers about a one of our national treasures in order to push its petty , ideological agenda directed against some `` right wing '' politics . 
  clearly i must be a `` fascist '' and guardian is `` quality journalism '' . 
  so , could anyone explain what 's a `` mainstream '' ? 
  it looks to me like a set of parties that are simply not approved by the internationale where some disturbing nationalists from jobbik or golden dawn are mixed with fidesz or pis and podemos or syriza with five stars and ciudadanos . 
   in others -- particularly the nations of southern europe , which , with memories of fascism and dictatorship still very much alive , have proved reluctant to flirt with rightwing extremism -- it is the far left that is advancing . 
  could it be the same pattern in case of eastern europe and current `` fascist '' parties ? 
  or maybe it 's too hard for this newspaper to use `` leftist '' and `` dictatorship '' in a one sentence and communism was just another `` mainstream '' system ? 
  this is just some sensationalist , leftist rag so calm down because poland cuts no primeval forest and there 's no way that eu can interfere into logging of some regular , unprotected forest . 
  the polish people `` royally fucked '' the leftist and `` liberal '' parties in recent elections and if they decide to do the same with a conservative partry then it will not be because of some manipulative foreign newspaper . 
  you wanted me to link something like that , so there you are . 
  no idea why do you thinks that i 'm upset , for me it 's just laughtable how irrational , incompetent and cowardly is the leftist establishment of germany and eu . 
  you get what you wanted but when you see your mistake then you wants to force others to face consequences , which is just unfair . 
  please , do n't be naive , it 's clear that cdu runs epp and other leftist factions which would agree on anything that germany wants anyway , again you just wants to share responsibility for the mistakes of your gov , which are actually results of previous mistaken policy ...  you must be grossly misinformed . 
  no , i 'm afraid that you 're [ misinformed ] ( https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2016/02/02/germany-to-house-10000-refugees-in-berlin-hotels-at-cost-of-e600-million/ ) and again i 'm giving just a one example . 
  these immigrants are even crossing our border because the alcohol and cigarettes are cheaper here , but no wonder that they do n't want to stay if some people in poland have to survive for as little as these immigrants [ gets for nothing ] ( http://www1.wdr.de/leistungen-fluechtlinge-100.html ) . 
   15.000 german federal police officers were these officers actually checking migrants when they were illegally violating borders of greece , hungary and croatia ? 
  as i 've said , you 've [ lost 10.000 migrant kids ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/30/fears-for-missing-child-refugees ) , your law enforcement services are the same incompetent and crippled by insane ideology as your politicians . 
  ... listen to yourself , first you take bunch of illegall immigrants ( millions at now actually ) , you call them `` refugees '' and just then you 're checking if they are actually seeking asylum or just your generous socialism . 
  we could and we 're helping ... to secure borders of macedonia , bulgaria and hungary , if the situation repeats we 'll send even more equipement and border guards in there . 
  you 're missing my point , i was comparing crimea and donbas exactly because the one was annexed and the other was n't . 
  if not for the logistics and `` public relations '' crimea would be taken much faster and donbas is not annexed yet not because russia is weak or incompetent so if it would want to take over baltics , that would be like german invasion of denmanrk . 
  no offence but i do n't quite trust germany and france as our allies and i 'd rather want to have a solid american force here instead of your promises . 
  foresters and ministry of enviroment argue that 's because of a plague of bark beetle . 
  often the infected trees are removed to save the healthy ones . 
  in soviet guardian . 
  for example [ austrian chancellor compares hungary 's treatment of migrants to the jews under the nazis ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11860682/germany-prepares-for-arrival-of-40000-refugees-this-weekend.html ) . 
  in september germany offered to all of the migrants a temporary residency , lots of naive people were welcoming these immigrants and cheering on a train stations in munuch and other cities but noone was checking who they actually are since hungary was given no time do so and only bashed for trying . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  turkey is already holding eu by the balls and that 's all because of german reaction to this crisis , they get lots of concessions and at the end erdogan even force you to react on some clown , which is just humilating for germany . 
  yes , of course our law enforcement services are limited by many factors but the difference is that we do n't tolerate offenders while you not only let them get away with their crimes , but you 're giving them houses , accomodation and money ... you even `` lost '' tens of thousands children on a way and god knows what these people smiggled or who the hell they are . 
  they could be all armed terrorists and you 'd do nothing about it because nobody even checked or registered them on illegall border crossings . 
  you ca n't and do n't want to deport anything , but rather to dump these people in every single european country which is just insane . 
  it happened only becausae macedonia got agreement with austrian hypocrites and visegrad group , but what is greece doing should be enough to kick them out of schengen . 
  oh please , if russia would only want to annex donbass , it would do it a long time ago when it overrun crimea in a day or two . 
  that 's just not their objective . 
  whatever is the condition of ukrainian army they at least have some tanks and fighter jets while there 's just a ** one old t-72 ** in latvia and we have to patrol their airspace constantly . 
  you know very well that these forces there are just temporary and we need some stable and permanent solutions finally . 
  i do n't actually care if there 's that base in germany or not , i know that americans moved out lots of installations and troops since the cold war , but times have changed , tensions and potential conflict is not on a border between eastern and western germany . 
  us already invests into the abm and the recent actions of russia should be enough to consider reaction if the nuclear threats against finnland , sweden and poland are n't , not to mention how armed kaliningrad is . 
  such as politicially dependant gas prices , different for each member state , recently this issue was finally rised by ec . 
  i do n't care abut their embargos as such , out former gov should n't support their accesion to wto and free trade area with kaliningrad . 
  i 'm complaining because of no reaction from eu institutions and member states . 
  status quo was many times changed since wwii and i do n't mean reunification of germany , dissolvement of czechoslovakia or yugoslavia in a bloody war . 
  i do n't mean also that now germany appease russia , this kind of ideas are present in france and italy , but for years moscow was ignored and excuses while its critics were treated as insane `` russophobes '' ( whatever that is ) . 
  i would n't also call `` healthy '' situation in which chancellor of the biggest player in europe is bribed into construction of a pipeline that he 's administrating on retirement ... 
  i see no reason why should we care so much about the russian opinions and interests while they clearly do n't care about diplomatic or any solutions . 
  who wants a war with russia ?
