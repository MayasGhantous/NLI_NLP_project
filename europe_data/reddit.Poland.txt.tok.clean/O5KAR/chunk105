   punished for what it did so who 's going to punish them ? 
  i 'm sorry to be such a cynical dick but have you ever seen a single russian or communist authority punished for anything , ever ? 
  i really wish it would be different , but it is n't and the rest of the world will not join you in any other way than simbolic support or economic sanctions . 
  dude , the ceasefire was never really respected , it 's just another day in eastern ukraine . 
  minsk never really worked and was n't made to work at all , already at the beginning russians decided it does not apply to [ debaltseve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_debaltseve ) and several points are just impossible to enforce , also because of lacking will from both sides . 
  this is a frozen conflict which can explode again . 
  i 'm afraid i must agree with the expert of [ blowjobs ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/254037,sikorski-comments-on-ukraine-%e2%80%98irresponsible-%e2%80%99-polish-mep ) , even if that should n't be said in public ... ukraine de facto gave up crimea and its military failed to restore order in a part of donbas , there 's no political solution either so , ukraine stays dependant and isolated because nobody wants to mess with russia . 
  judging by the opinions of this holy trinity and their followers , the opinions of polish people are quite different and as far as it 's a democratic country they 're the sovereign here . 
  it is , but unfortunatelly underfunded and not as effective as post soviet propaganda . 
  it 's not ironic at all , it 's what they should be doing all the time , exposing and confronting the kremlin propaganda . 
  well , the `` freedom fighters '' were in many cases former communists which lost some faction fights inside the party . 
  yes , it 's a clear nepotism , but it 's not corruption . 
  that 's not corruption and no contests were removed , rather fixed the same as they were before , but this time media actually do what they should be doing for years , controlling the gov. 
  dude , believe in whatever you wants , it does n't matter anyway and does n't work anymore , obviously . 
  you just do n't see how counter productive is that leftist narration , especially in post communist poland . 
  so , according to nyt both aws and lpr were not `` right wing '' parties , but pis aparently is . 
  strange , many people are labelling even po as a `` right wing '' party and some say that pis is too much `` socialist '' to be considered as such . 
  it 's always relative and subjective , but most of aws is now divided between pis and po , the latter one was also composed of a `` liberal '' uw and in recent years shifted more to the left , lost most of its conservative members ( they 're in pis or around ) . 
  it 's just illogical to consider pis as a `` right wing '' and not considering aws , but to not label lpr as such is simply ridiculous ... 
  it was a really nationalistic and anti eu party , just recently its leadership gone crazy and besides of promoting some [ creationism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maciej_giertych ) it 's supporting po , eu and its [ former leader ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_giertych ) is clearly obsessed with kaczy\u0144ski . 
  anyway it 's not that the `` righ wing '' appeared suddently from nowhere , most of these people are in politics since 1989 or even before if we consider `` solidarno\u015b\u0107 '' ( and few former communists party members ) . 
  of course , but when you say that the country in general is benefiting from it then i say it 's just a benefit for few companies , the leftist regime of korea and actually these koreans . 
  once again you 're proving my point . 
  politicians and `` journalists '' loves playing on emotions and radicalise their supporters or viewers to keep them activated but there 're some limits of absurd . 
  when leftists are screaming `` fascist '' at everybody around they 're actually ridiculing the real fascists or just criminals . 
  whichever that party is , it 's ruling because people chose it in democratic and free elections and you should finally come to terms with it . 
  except for witing a ridiculous comment , nothing i know about . 
  the leftist regime did plenty of horrible things and it 's really not funny to see its former high ranking participants lecturing people in meadias about freedom or democracy . 
  that 's not what i mean , i mean the legal way in which they took power , democratic elections . 
  abuse of power is a good description of what 's happening i guess , but the empty talk about `` democracy '' and ridiculous accusations are not . 
  ... so how did they get this majority and president ? 
  they can do many things but why should i comment something they ** did n't done ** ? 
  it seems to me that indeed some people have a problem with democracy when people do n't vote as they do , while the gov has a problem to accept the rulings of the constitutional court . 
  the politics of poland are not decided on the streets , nor in usa and only partly in eu just because people voted in favour of accession . 
   if they 're really that nationalistic , authorian and what if they are n't ? 
  it seems that not being internationalist or euro federalist is already a defintion of `` nationalism '' for some people , but anyway it does n't matter . 
  all of these labels are misleading , relative and never fully describes the policies , but in case of `` nazism '' or more often `` fascism '' it 's usually just a primitive insult , especially considering the emotional reception . 
  so far pis was accused of being nazis , fascists , communists , stalinists and all sorts of obviusly offensive adjectives , some more creative journalists managed to compare them with isis but there 's not much more * left * to accuse them of . 
  it 's always relative so i 'm trying to follow the local standards , but i must admit i know little about romanian politics , so could you tell me which is actually the `` right wing '' party that you was talking about ? 
   disabling the opposition and essentially dissolving democracy if that 's actually happening in reality , not in someone 's paranoid imagination or unwise and unclear declarations , then maybe , but still authoritiarism is something else . 
  president has very little power in polish mixed system , so whatever min . 
  szczerski is considering as `` taking back toys and ruling alone '' is not going to happend without parilament . 
  considering what leftists did in poland their victim complex is quite amusing . 
  depends if you takes chants and slogans from demonstrations as anything serious , but i do n't even know who was that adressed to exactly . 
   polish or hungarian nazis are proud which `` polish nazis '' exactly ? 
  according to the leftist puppet regime everybody who opposed them was a fascist , including the polish army on exile and resistance which fought against germany since the very beginning , when communists were their allies . 
   corruption and associated with communism it 's exactly opposite in poland , if i 'm not wrong the same goes for hungary . 
  post communists are in almost every party , but the `` leftist '' is a direct sucessor of the communist party . 
  it 's not even in parliament anymore and many of its former high ranking members are now cooperating with the `` liberal '' party . 
  both are associated with corruption , wile the `` fascist '' party always tried to fight it , or at least pretend to do so . 
  what do you call people accusing everybody of `` fascism '' all the time ? 
  no idea why you 're linking this leftist tabloid but there 's nothing `` fascist '' , nor anything wise , in the comment of min . 
  you 're not mistaken , but if you thinks that it 's in any danger of logging then you 're wrong . 
  no , i do n't see . 
  any examples or some solid quotes , links , whatever ? 
  no idea about all of it , it looks to me like a bunch of kids or thugs quarelling in a snadbox and lets be honest ... you 're a side in it so forgive me if i will take your words with a grain of salt . 
  if you ask me , both nationalists and `` antifascists '' can disappear and nobody will ever miss them . 
  officially russia liberated western ukraine and belarus , the polish fascists were arrested and punished . 
  apparently [ lithuanian fascists were deported ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_deportations_from_lithuania ) . 
  true , there was also that demonstration on which someone helped kaczy\u0144ski to shout about the `` communists and thieves '' . 
  the difference is that nobody takes it sertiously , it 's always some slogan or a chant on a protest or such ocasion , for the other hand you have some apparently serious , self proclaimed experts and authorities analysing if someone is a nazi or still just a fascist ... 
  the people you 're talking about are usually neither nationalist , nor authoritarian , but rather common thugs and criminals . 
  i 'm talking about some conservative or even nationalist politicians and journalists , the public figures . 
  sorry , but could you actually find a single article , a speech of some active politician or some other public figure using this kind of accusation ? 
  i see no difference between these groups , it 's basicly a one party with competing factions and the same goal . 
  i 'll try to be delicate this time and really i mean no offence , but your party is too insignificant to be called whatever , unless you really care about some anonymous comments on the net . 
  i 'm not following , on a one hand you say that this is a thoughtless insult and then you 're just using it . 
  many of these onr types are just thugs and criminals , as i 've said , not much different than antifa , but can you honestly call mw or bosak a `` nazi '' ? 
  no idea what makes you call this or the other people like that , you just contradict your previous edition and what 's actually `` authoritarian '' about pis ? 
  the strong leadership of its founder and chairman ? 
  the same can be said about the other parties and governments , but that 's not authoritarism yet . 
  and our workers are being replaced by ukrainians , no idea about the chechens that came in 90s , probably they 're in germany already . 
  excuse me , but our politics are quite diversed , or do you mean that not all of the parties are leftists promoting `` diversity '' as a model of artificial social engineering ? 
  women can decide over their bodies , but not about the bodies of their children , we do n't allow * aborting * people regardless of their age . 
  so , how many polish criminals do you have already ? 
  just fyi [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d7/crimes_recorded_by_the_police%2c_2002%e2%80%9312_yb14.png ) you have eurostat crime statistics ... how strong is that old anti polish sentiment in germany ? 
  maybe , since we have a very little gender pay gap compared to western europe , but a bit higher gini index . 
  so far we 're doing quite well , since the bankrupcy of communism we quadrupled our gdp and you should be rather worried about greece or portugal which we 're leaving behind already . 
  there were many philosophers . 
  communism actually never was introduced to an industrialised state , in russia the `` proletaryans '' were just created after lenin 's junta introduced `` marxism leninism '' , an `` alliance '' of workers and farmers , hence the hammer and scikle , because that was rural country . 
  in every country there 're differences , `` equality '' is unrealistic utopy and besides of the clearly brutal and radical ways of its introduction , it 's harmful because only diversity , competition and freedom leads to progress ( not the ideologic determinism ) . 
  i guess that 's more amongst the common people than the `` elites '' and especially media , or am i wrong ? 
  i 'm not saying that ther 's no reason to argue , but when someone compares you to `` hitler '' there 's no more any space for discussion . 
  i do n't want to proove you wrong , because it 's just too easy , but maybe i 'm concentrating a bit more on poland because i 'm just polish and my opinions are based , at least partly , on my experiences and knowledge . 
  i 'm also curious about the opinions of foreigners . 
  i do n't know why is that a problem and if you really have to say that i 'm * always * `` trigerred '' then be my guest , i 'm not going to complain or downvote you , i 'm actually almost never doing that . 
  you was n't reading my comments , was you ? 
  i know that people likes radical , clear opinions , but in case of north koreans i just do n't think it 's so easy . 
  also , a homosexualist complaining about victim complex is quite rich , but anyway allow me to write and think whatever i want as long as it 's in line with reddit policy , ok ? 
  well , at least you 're not getting banned for criticising or joking about poland in this sub ... yeah , maybe it 's just my victim complex and i should n't say a one more thing about chosen people before it happends again . 
   all the time again . 
   always that 's quite often . 
  believe me , i 'm calm even if i 'm being constantly misunderstood , insulted and accused of being a `` slaver '' . 
  this can be said about every ideology , but somehow in practice they always lead to the same ends , maybe with some local variations of less or more radical and brutal implementation . 
  i often see this kind of excuses , that it was not the `` real '' communism and some single person ( lenin , stalin , mao , pol pot , kim il sung etc ) is the one and only guilty , but unfortunatelly it 's not so simple ... 
  if that 's the case , maybe the founders of these ideas were just naive and mistaken since their invention never worked in reality . 
  why then i do n't hear the accusations of communism ? 
  it 's always the other end somehow ... 
  sorry , but you 're giving too much importance to something that is just a primitive slogan , an insult used against political opponents . 
  thanks , i think that there 's [ a world apart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_world_apart_%28book%29 ) still in the polish high school curriculum .
