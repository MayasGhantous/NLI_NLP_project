  two years at that age is a very long time . 
  that 's fine because it feels wrong , but what i 'm saying is that there 're worse things and these people experience them . 
  gremlin from the kremlin . 
  really ? 
  besides , that was not the reason why / u/hipokryzja got emotional . 
  i guess that 's the only correct way , but stil i ca n't stop thinking about these people and that sick communist regime . 
  maybe i 'm wrong , but these few chosen ones that are allowed to work abroad are learning something about the outside world and lives better life than in north korea . 
  indeed . 
  neither am i , but i was actually watching a documentary on juche and talking with people that visited the best korea . 
  it was few years ago of watch docs festival in warsaw . 
  it is communism , just a worse kind , more totalitarian and authoritiarian since it 's not a puppet regime controlled by gremlin . 
  china is not much leftist anymore , but best korea is . 
  you know that 's a one time option and includes death penalty for their families ? 
  oh wait , germans forgot what communism is ... 
  was kant a catholic third order dominican studying at russian university , working for a russian king and defending russia from german `` crusaders '' ? 
  if so than lukas podolski and miroslav klose are polish . 
  sorry to say litwa , but your invention is kinda broken . 
  yes . 
  well , now you 've heard it and it 's actually strange that it 's not used more often . 
  i 'm sorry if someone will get triggered . 
  well , is n't it bullshit in many cases ? 
  anyway i 'm just not sure what to do in this situation , it 's a tragedy of these people , but sending them back to korea is not going to improve their situation . 
  i sense butthurt . 
  no no , that was n't the `` real '' communism ... 
  obviously that was n't a serious comment and the story of copernicus monument has very much to do with the claims to his nationality . 
  frederic `` schopping '' was just a bonus for laughts . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm strongly anti communist , but it 's just too easy and comfortable to play heroes in our situation without considering theirs . 
  there 's just no way to help these people without a nuclear war against that sick regime . 
  yes , it 's a shame and should n't be happening , but it 's not that simple because these people are slave labourers under that regime anyway and we ca n't do much about it . 
  that 's true , these are not really serious money and kims knew how to print $ , but they 're slaves no matter what , same as the other people in north korea . 
  i 'm not saying that 's good , i repeat it 's a shame , but you know that people in best korea are starving , right ? 
  vice news reporting from war zones is really good , at least that 's what i think , but some reports for example about aborting people were just a vulgar propaganda . 
  yes , it 's nothing new actually , but it 's a shame ... 
  the local leftist regime used to do the same with polish workers going abroad . 
  the upside is that these koreans have actually three meals a day and they 're still working in far better conditions than they would back at home . 
  she complained about `` racism '' two years before , but again everybody 's jumping to conclusions and use a tragedy to make a point ( or sell a paper ) . 
  really ? 
  well , his biography is not so clear , but sure you can call him `` lithuanian '' . 
  ok , it sounds more believeable but still the question is ... how could that bomb be used against police ? 
  i do n't think it could be just smuggled into the station and left somewhere . 
  [ how to irritate ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolaus_copernicus_monument,_warsaw#history ) ( read the part about wwii ) also relevant :  friedrich schopping [ i.e. 
  frederic chopin ] was a genius , so he could not be a pole . 
  this is the greatest composer born in the german land . 
  good points , some interesting trivia on quo vadis film , but aside of that it 's probably a one of the most famous books of polish writers . 
  why not [ kodak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kodak_fortress ) ? 
   dzerginsk is that name related to this [ asshole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felix_dzerzhinsky ) ? 
  also , why do n't you change dnipropetrovsk to [ kodak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kodak_fortress ) ? 
  my point exactly . 
  [ mine detector ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_mine_detector ) . 
  ballistic vest , made by [ jan szczepanik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_szczepanik ) in 1901 saved king alfonso xiii . 
  a similar vest developed by [ kazimierz \u017begle\u0144 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casimir_zeglen ) unfortunatelly did not saved archduke franz ferdinand . 
  szczepanik discovered also tri-color phography , colorimetr , electric rifle and many other things ... [ sendivogius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sendivogius ) * pioneer of chemistry , he developed ways of purification and creation of various acids , metals and other chemical compounds . 
  he discovered that air is not a single substance and contains a life-giving substance-later called oxygen 170 years before similar discoveries by scheele and priestley . 
  * [ rudolf weigl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rudolf_weigl ) inventor of the first effective typhus vaccine , he also helped many jews during german occupation . 
  also , some people had [ very interesting ways ] ( http://www.damninteresting.com/polands-biological-defensive/ ) to trick germans . 
  [ multi-stage rocket ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazimierz_siemienowicz ) but still can not into space :(, 
   that few know, 
  last year [ brunon kwiecie\u0144 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/brunon_kwiecie%c5%84 ) was sentenced for plotting a terrorist attack on polish parliament . 
  every anti terrorist bill would be controversial , or every bill actually . 
  i would even consider that 's the case if that was a stadium , anything related to the rival team or police , but this is just a public bus with random people ... 
  many fans or hooligans are idiots , thugs and criminals , but this theory sounds just ridiculous . 
   most likely to recent protests of football hooligans according to a one guy which is apparently an anti terorist . 
  it sounds hardly believeable . 
  well , i mean police or not , but burning cars and rioting is absolutelly exotic in here , maybe during communism but it was really dangerous then and in early 90s . 
  do n't worry , mexican food is great and the wearther is [ pretty nice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epg6zuyvuzg ) ... 
  well , we 've had in poland lots of such massacres ( 1956 , 1968 , 1970 , 1981 ) under the leftist puppet regime , at least in france someone was finally judged and senteced for that . 
  this is ridiculous that police ca n't do a thing to stop criminals , it 's like you just do n't have police , but i must say also that the protestors are different ... 
  i ca n't imagine people doing things like that in poland , if someone throws a stone it 's like a terrible scandal , only once i 've seen a car of one leftist tv burned , but never police . 
  if you mean hollande , it looks like he 's finished , nobody supports him anymore but that 's something else . 
  whoewer is in charge or protesting , police should protect people and catch criminals . 
  namaste - * from europe 's mexico *, 
  ... that 's france , i guess it 's the same shocking for a romanian guy as it is for me , be there it 's nothing new . 
  say , what 's wrong with the french police ? 
  every time i see someting , farmers devastating spanish wine , `` refugees '' attacking lorries , some `` protestors '' robbing shops or buring cars ... these policemen are always just standing and doing nothing . 
  are they forbidden to enforce law and arrest criminals ? 
   the axe could fall on trees dotted around at least a quarter of the bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest area , ** excluding the national park ** , and possibly as much as two-thirds of it . 
  yeah , so if someone got fooled by this leftist newspaper already , it 's clearly said that the forest in question is not the `` ancient '' forest . 
  it 's a barely 200 years old section around it that was planted by idiots who put there only spruce trees that are attacked by a bark beetle now . 
  except that poland is not chopping down the protected part of the forest . 
  the part they want to cut down is 200 years old . 
  hmm , you may be right , sorry for mistake . 
  so , ca n't you do that in poland if tyou really wants to be sterylised ? 
  anyway i think this is a stipid law , it would be much better for some people to sterylise instead of killing babies . 
  ja , unconcious people are untermensch . 
  that 's strange because vasectomy is performed , even if the law is not clear about it because it 's possible to reverse that so the point about * permanent * damage is not valid . 
  it 's possible to reverse salpingectomy as well . 
  lets burn the unconscious ones so the master race of insomnia will rule the welt . 
  so , it would be your baby as well , but you 'd reject it because of father . 
  i do n't think that you can just predict and plan reaction to thins kind of trauma , but i hope you 'll never need to . 
  yes , i think this is absurd that it 's not allowed , but is it the same with [ salpingectomy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salpingectomy ) ? 
  sure , use the legendary coathanger , but it would be easier after birth to hang your baby ... 
  listen , not even once i 've said what to do or what not to do , i 'm just saying what 's a human and it seems that 's bothering everybody becuse that 's the whole point in here . 
  no idea really , the border was quite long and hard to defend already with few fortifications and no serious plan , no exercises and outdated tactics . 
  that actually happened and there was a battle of [ bzura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_bzura ) ( kutno ) , but it could n't change the course of events , only gave more time to prepare defence of warsaw . 
  i guess that was shocking for everybody and especially for the generation of wwi , but it was not an accident as france prooved it . 
  no idea about britain and alternative scenarios , it just happened and equally surprised soviets took advantage of this `` sitzkrieg '' , it could be as well said that they waited until `` allies '' made it official in abbeville . 
  anyway just the french had any serious force on the ground , british had it in the air and sea , but they were [ bombing germany with propaganda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sa-hcb367q ) . 
   reich leader bouhler and dr. brandt are entrusted with the responsibility of extending the authority of physicians , designated by name , so that patients who , on the basis of human judgment [ menschlichem ermessen ] , are considered incurable , can be granted mercy death [ gnadentod ] after a definitive diagnosis . 
  i 'm talking for myself , so no idea who are you talking to . 
  how am i forcing children on someone , am i raping women , or what ?
