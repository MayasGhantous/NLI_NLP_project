  i 'm sick of that primitive propaganda . 
   not ideal situation nobody says that , but `` aborting '' people becouse of poverty is just barbaric . 
  again and again i repeat , we 're not talking about rape , so to say that it 's `` unwanted '' is just irrational . 
  nobody 's forcing the people to rise kids , not even the ones which fathers are rapists , there 's always a possibility to give a kid away for adoption . 
  it 's not easy , but how else are we reproducing ? 
  it 's just the nature and all of our mothers went through it . 
  i hope none of them regrets it . 
  then , as i 've said , there 's adoption . 
  the best is to avoid the `` problems '' if you do n't want to deal with them . 
  are you crazy ? 
  no violence , including rape is allowed or tolerated in poland . 
  then there 's adoption also . 
  to call it a `` mistake '' is quite a foolish euphemism ... 
  there 's no ideal solution in this situation , the world is not perfect . 
  in case of danger of mother 's life or lethal pathology of the baby , it 's allowed to `` abort '' it in poland . 
  is it not possible for leftys to avoid these moronic slogans and stereotypes ? 
  removing humans is primitive , not the `` ban '' on it . 
  i 'm not a beliver of any religion , including the culth of `` progress '' and most of people in poland are not really religious . 
  sad , but true , there 're criminals in every country . 
  there 're also irresponsible idiots who do n't bother using anticonception and facing the consequences of procreation . 
  ... becouse it explicly says that `` tradition '' is a source of violence . 
  the rest is just your paranoid imagination . 
  forcing how ? 
  i thought we 're not talking about rape and besides of anticonception there 're also adoptions , nobody 's `` forced '' to rise a child . 
  sorry , but really the last sentence was kinda strange . 
  right , i just pointed out how ridiculous was the last sentence . 
  ok , i may sound a bit annoyed , but there 're really many options and possibilites to avoid or resolve this `` problem '' . 
  source ? 
  do n't bother anyway , i know very well that you 're just lying . 
  the women are not `` asked '' to give births to the people and as long as it 's not a rape it 's all about the `` opinion '' of parents . 
  have you ever had a biology lesson at the school ? 
  get out of what ? 
  removing humans just becouse they 're a `` problem '' for someone is just sick . 
   and the life of the potential child by `` aborting '' it . 
  fuck logic ... dude , you know that it 's possible to give the kid for adoption ? 
  i just hope you know about anticonception and it was merely an accident . 
  nobody says it 's easy , maye except some extremists , but removing a `` problematic '' human is not a solution . 
  ok , remove the poor and sick , we ' r going to live in a paradise . 
  no , it is n't unless you 're a monkey . 
  civilisation is a part of human nature and should serve it . 
  which worldviews and culture ? 
  it 's not my fault that many migrants or gypsyies refuse to integrate despite many expensive policies . 
  and what 's so `` progressive '' about `` aborting '' humans ? 
  save me those boring slogans . 
  no , i do n't say it 's good in any , not just the `` modern '' society , all i say is that 's natural . 
  aside the jokes , it was hitler who introduced `` abortion '' in poland and for quite a clear reason . 
  it is just your opinion about the `` modern '' society , the reality is that you ca n't control minds . 
  like deportation for example ? 
  really , it does n't work and unless they 're really mistreated , or mistreat the danes , there 's no drama . 
  you mean to bully or to force them ? 
  the people are like that , you ca n't have a positive opinion about everybody and everything , there 's nothing wrong about that unless it turn into violence . 
  hint - it does n't in peacefull denmark . 
  why ? 
  no , it is n't , you can tolerate something that you do n't like or have a prejudice against . 
  the people are afraid to speak their minds and to be insulted in return . 
  no , that 's a prejudice . 
  seriously , if they do n't want to integrate , they should n't be forced or bribed with useless social programs . 
  there 's nothing `` intolerant '' about leaving them alone . 
  yes , there 're some extreme patologic conditions which should be considered . 
  not just every deformation or genetic disorder like it 's at now . 
  as for the rape , this 's the `` unwanted pregnancy '' for real . 
   in case of rape there was n't such a case of `` abortion '' since four years in poland and as for deformation it should depend . 
  for example , i do n't think that humans with down syndrome should be eleiminated . 
  speak for yoursleve . 
  it 's allowed in few extreme cases and it should stay like that , except `` aborting '' handicaped and sick people . 
  the only thing that should be promoted is responsibility , anticonception and some basic biological knowladge . 
  feminists promotes the exact opposite , ignorance and irresposibility . 
  i was talking about poland , no idea how 's that in the other countries , except english speaking uk and usa , which have quite diversed medial market . 
  i 'd like to see that . 
  do you have some source ? 
  another pathetic idea of feminists . 
  it will be surely supported by r/europe , but fortunatelly [ poles do n't like `` aborting '' people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_in_poland#public_opinion ) . 
  ok , i was being sarcastic , but seriously somone should talk with arab league and saudis to do something about their fellow muslims . 
  you mean now ? 
  it 's all related to history , at least since partitions , congresse of vienna and industrial revolution . 
  [ invest in eastern poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/why_didn%27t_you_invest_in_eastern_poland%3f ) , 
  it was posted on r/europe already . 
  negative opinion is not `` intolerance '' yet , it 's just opinion and i hope that it 's still allowed to think . 
  it 's not the fault of danes that gypsy culture and behavior is not viewed with sympathy , there 's a reason they are n't liked almost anywhere . 
  and what purpose would that alliance serve ? 
  except the interests of stalin , who demanded military access through poland and would probably never move out . 
  of course appeasment was a tragic mistake , but still it appeared that the soviets are not necessary to hold germans . 
  in 1939 hitler still appeared as the lesser evil . 
  the purges , femines and other , including etchnic , brutal policies of the soviets , were quite well known . 
  sure they did what was best for them at the time , but then they paid a horrible price for stupidity of stalin . 
  no , that 's why germany signed a `` non agression '' treaty with the soviets and secured their eastern border . 
  without that they would n't be able to move such forces into france and low countries . 
   harsh terms come on , not that german revisionism again . 
  we both know that the assasination in sarajevo was not the real cause of the war , the same as german invasion would n't be if not the whole political situation in europe . 
  germany was not the only country where a movement of wwi veterans and revisionists took power . 
  it was also not the only ideology that emerged then . 
  so what was the direct cause ? 
  to say that it was the german invasion is obvious , but also quite simplified and does n't give any perspective . 
  we 'll never know that , but we know at least that they invided together and shared the whole region , not just a one country . 
  i agree and i 've said it already that germany had no need for soviet military assistance , they needed a political support . 
  yes , sooner or later from a one or the other side . 
  both could n't accept the outcome of wwi , but mind also that germany held not just a grudge against france , but also territorial claims . 
  a common border between the soviets and germany would n't last forever and the world war would happend anyway . 
  but i was talking then . 
  it 's relevant as every bias serves some goal , in another words it 's just ridiculous to call a declaration of some political activists an `` evidence '' .
