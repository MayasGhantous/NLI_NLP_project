  ok , i understand that , but there would n't be such a problem if currency would actually resemble reserves or anything material . 
  i 'm not any economist , but i guess this could also be resolved by harmonisation of interest rates . 
  as far as i know neither greece , nor many other $ zone states , fulfilled requirements or were n't keeping them , not to mention that many were/are just cooking books . 
  anyway the problem is not just the currency imbalance that you 're talking about , since greece still is a member of monetary union , but also this could help them if they could actually devaluate their currency . 
  throwing money at them is obviously not working . 
  i 'm sorry for these incompetent fools in our gov , they 're just embarassing . 
  anyway , it seems that i was just partly right and it 's only 5.5 bln z\u0142oty ( currently 1usd = 3.7 pln ) in a one year only . 
  i would n't be so sure , not even our former fm `` radek '' sikorski was in his private conversations . 
  to me it 's obvious that russia violated international laws when annexing crimea , or that the mess in ukraine is in noones interest , except russia of course . 
  besides of that they 're partly responsible for the whole political and economic situation of ukraine also since they got independent . 
  i 've said it twice already that i doubt we 're in danger of their invasion . 
  how europe is n't or was n't involved in iraq , afghanistan or lybia ? 
  you seems to be more afraid of russia than me , but we do n't need to be openly or secretly involved in a proxy war , we should however adress the situation on our borders and it should be done a long time ago , at least when georgia was invided . 
  ministry of finaces , but i guess that 's just an example and there 're more military spendings included in the other ministries . 
  it may be , but i know for sure that the f-16s which we just payed for are not included in the budget of our ministry of defence . 
  do n't know how 's that in the other countries , but we 're spending much more than it 's in the official data . 
  i like our skyscrapers . 
  warsaw will never be like krak\u00f3w or any other city , but it 's getting better . 
  seriously i do n't like this complaining and complexes . 
  i doubt that 2.2 % includes 35 bln . 
  $ that we 're just spending for choppers , rockets and navy . 
  eh , i thought it was clear that i 'm talking about the former ussr , not the former puppet states . 
  do n't think i 'm so paranoid , but still i do n't want the mess in neighboring countries . 
  yea , but still we 're getting quite a bit of tourists , 
  have a smile  if you smile in public to strangers , they 'll consider you a looney , but it 's not so bad once you start talking with someone . 
  hard to say , there 're many great cities that i 've seen and many more that i have n't visited , yet . 
  for sure budapest , prague and vienna would be the top three . 
  poorly rebuilt ? 
  also the commie blocks are n't gray anymore , most of them were renovated and nicely painted . 
  russia is full of foreign cultures , they are the world 's biggest country for a reason , but i doubt they have any interest ( or power ) to meddle outside of the former ussr . 
  it 's not just cynical , but also naive to think that we can ignore them and what they consider their zone of intrests . 
  dude , people can have their prejudices and opinions , but most of them will just ignore foreigners and if you ask for something they 'll always help . 
  i 'm really sorry about that negative stereotype of romanias , but it 's just becouse of ignorance and the fact that there was time when we had streets full of begging gypsyies from romania . 
  the problem is , as i 've said , that romania is almost not existing in our medias and politics , which is a big mistake . 
  balcerowicz is kinda controvercial and `` his '' plan was just made by george soros . 
  in 90s it was the time of huge scandals and crooks , lots of people were cheated and robbed of their savings . 
  i 'd say that we 're coping with the reality not becouse of politicians , but rather despite them . 
  people do n't even want to vote , if there 's a turnout of 50 % in elections , it 's considered a great sucess . 
  do you seriously belive in honesty of politicians ? 
  they say a one thing in public , the other in private ... would you ever suspect such a `` hawk '' like sikorski to whine about conflict with russia and germany or sucking american dicks ? 
  people are just scared , but they do n't make this kind of decissions , goverments does . 
  yes , it 's quite important here . 
  especially several namesdays associated with another holidays , like [ andrzejki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._andrew%27s_day ) or [ miko\u0142ajki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st_nicholas_day ) . 
  same here , even if i 'm definetly not a nationalist . 
  if they push it too far , the people will rebel and belive me ... you do n't want to fight another solidarno\u015b\u0107 or such a movement . 
  poland stronk ? 
  no , we 're in between much stronger forces , as usually . 
  anyway people here will never support that federal lunacy , but the survival of eu and cooperation with others is essential , this is also why i 'm strongly against internationalism becouse it will just destroy what we already have . 
  btw . 
  i never undrstood why we 're ignoring romania , you can hardly hear a thing about it in the news and unfortunatelly most of people confuse you with ... gypsyies ( sorry ) . 
  the ones who earned billions from european `` help '' for greece ? 
  this is as well a problem of greece as $ zone . 
  this will destroy the union , instead of making it stronger , it will only strenghten its problems and opposition . 
  europe does n't need more ideology and wishful thinking , you need to stop cooking books , start respecting treaties and rules , but most of all respect each others instead of forcing some insane internationalism . 
  why would that be a catastrophe and for whom ? 
  for greece that would be a solution and they could recover a long time ago . 
  today it was n't too hot , but i 've had a [ ch\u0142odnik ] ( http://widelcem-pisane.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/chlodnik-litewski-6.jpg ) , a kind of cold barszcz ( or [ borscht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borscht#cold_borscht ) ) . 
  i guess all the balto-slavs knows it . 
  fun fun stats from google public data ... you wants some good laughts ? 
  check the [ inflation rates of several post communist states ] ( http://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=b&amp;strail=false&amp;nselm=s&amp;met_x=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;scale_x=lin&amp;ind_x=false&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;met_s=sp_pop_totl&amp;scale_s=lin&amp;ind_s=false&amp;dimp_c=country:region&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;iconsize=0.5&amp;unisize=0.035#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_defl_kd_zg&amp;fdim_y=inflation_type:1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:blr:rus:ukr:bgr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) in 90s . 
  ok , tesco beer is worse ( i guess ) . 
  i was just fixing thier commercial slogan . 
  it used to be a decent beer , egon olsen was drinking that , 
  do n't drink in public . 
  seriously , it 's not allowed . 
  aside of that ... have fun . 
   carlsberg probably the worst beer on the world . 
  seriously i 'm really angry that they bought many great polish breweries and turned them into cheap piss . 
  both . 
  in free time i 'm also an evil mastermind plotting how to opress the chosen minorities , it 's fun . 
  rather some random accusations to make homosexuals look like especially opressed and extort compassion , followed by their political demands . 
  i 'm not expecting special treatment just becouse some thugs beat me or robbed several times . 
  old news , made by the homosexual activists for themselves ... you could at least link the recent report of some ep comission , which is as well laughtable . 
  seriously there 're people who have bigger problems than some wa\u0142\u0119sa talking bullshit . 
  during the 2013 un climate summit in warsaw i was talking with some representatives of pge . 
  they 've made it clear that no wind or solar power would be profitable if not eu subsidies and that the communities are ... obliged to buy the `` green '' power . 
  i guess this is a great busyness for many , but not for the taxpayers . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm all for clean energy , but this is not the way . 
   down with that capitalist system comrade , why are n't you voting die linke ? 
  seriously , this is not capitalism . 
  most of eurocrates do n't use their ` capitas ' and they should be replaced , not eu . 
  yes , i clearly said what i think about the state regulating relationships between the people , with no exceptions , `` equally '' . 
  no , it 's not a contradiction . 
  parents are usually passing on their kids etchics , or ideology anyway , politicians should serve the people , not pushing their ideology on kids . 
  ok , if that article was not good enough , maybe you 'll consider [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/6165174/children-as-young-as-five-should-be-taught-about-abortion.html ) . 
  apparently that `` touching private parts '' was in a draft of the document , but it does n't change much . 
  you 're really missing the point and concentrates on some details . 
  i gave that example of masturbation as the most controvercial , but still just example , the point is that this ridiculous gender ideology is the thing those people protests against . 
  if you wants to teach your kids how `` touching private parts '' is a good thing or that `` aborting '' people is `` safe '' , then do it at home , in school there should not be any ideology . 
  afirmation of `` non standard '' relationships is just a one part of this so called `` progress '' and just a one reason that these people are demonstrating . 
  same goes for this un document , it 's just a part and example of a much wider policy , which according to these people ( and me ) is unnatural and forcefull redefinition of family and social relations . 
  again , you 're not reading what i 'm writing . 
  i 've said clearly about inheritance and income tax in the context of marriage privillages that should not be granted to this or the other group of people , but rather to everybody ( which would n't make them privillages anymore ) . 
  where 's that `` violence '' ? 
  are n't you confusing r/europe with r/africa ? 
  the last time i 've checked we were talking about the oh so violent `` hate speech '' . 
  ... read my comment again instead of asking the questions that i 've answered already . 
  i do n't even know what are you referring to , your quotations and answers makes no sense . 
   article yeah , right ... the article quotes exact ideas from [ this ] ( http://www.google.pl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccuqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2funesdoc.unesco.org%2fimages%2f0018%2f001832%2f183281e.pdf&amp;ei=xpchvzblcyr7ygpouzb4&amp;usg=afqjcnhfk99froz5u99xpxfczto6ck-ubg&amp;sig2=v3bdtoznsjlidmt5ho6v_g&amp;bvm=bv.96339352,d.bgq ) document .
