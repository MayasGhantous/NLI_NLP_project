  do n't know a country called `` west '' , but i 'm not `` everyone '' . 
  how many troops had the germans on western border in september 1939 ? 
  they even moved out heavy artillery just to siege warsaw . 
  sorry , but all of those excuses sounds just poorly if you compare the polish forces and `` allied '' ( including neutral benelux ) which resisted for about a similar time . 
  you sent an expedition to norway ( which included our troops and fleet ) just becouse it was close and strategic place , poland and the whole region was only a decoy . 
  peace in our time ... 
  ca n't say for them , but i agree they shouldnt be counted becouse of their etchnicity , which was often just `` discovered '' be the germans . 
  do n't know if i can say for poland , but just to speak my mind i feel like this was a one huge etchnic `` revolution '' during and after wwii in europe . 
  all of the genocides , population transfers and border changes resulted in creation of artificially monoetchinic country which is poland since then . 
  it is , at lest for me , a historical data about a failed experiment that we should learn about to not make this mistake again . 
  i guess that 's just sematics , unless you really consider a one nation to be `` chosen '' and treat the others differently . 
  face it , even the `` polish '' communists were executed , later it was hard for stlin to make up the new `` polish '' goverment for `` liberation '' . 
  the repressions were partly political , but mostly etchnic in these two mentioned cases . 
  yeah , i know your `` historiography '' , it 's not just false but also unreasonable . 
  you 're just repeating some unsupported theories , while i could just quote the `` generalissimus '' saying the same about the `` west '' bleeding out in a war between each other ... stalin tried whatever to expand the socialists `` empire '' and gladly aided and trained the german army when they still tried to cover it up , long time before hitler . 
  the soviet mindset and propaganda was similar to german ( not just national socialists ) in regard of versaillese treaty and post wwi borders . 
  it was the same revisionist sentiment , so called west ukraine and west belarus or baltic states and bessarabia were n't any `` buffers '' . 
  i know german `` generalplan-ost '' , but it makes no difference since the soviets did n't mind it at all until germans broke their alliance and invided . 
  soviets did n't care about any jews , not to mention the poles , in a `` zone of german interest '' as general goverment was called by them . 
  the only reason it did n't happend was a german invasion on the soviets . 
  you joking ? 
  polish jews were just polish citizens , the whole etchnic changes in here were compltly unnatural and against the traditions and i do n't mean just the jews , the whole etchnic compostion of poland was brutally changed . 
  the loss of jewish community , as well as rusin , orthodox , german and the whole popultion transfers were a disaster . 
  so speak for yourselve . 
  who are `` we '' ? 
  do n't know who wants to `` score '' what in here , the point is that a one political doctrine failed miserably not just becouse of slaughtering countless number of people , but also becouse it was extremly ineffective , unnatural and simply insane . 
  it should be abandoned and forgotten just like national socialism was . 
   attack russia ? 
  no , attack germany before russinas invided poland ... baltic states , romania and finnland . 
  you and les frogs were obliged to do so 14 days after war declaration and that 's why stalin was waiting until september 17 . 
  not in here , this subreddit is full of leftys so do n't worry , you 're going to get your upvotes . 
  you may ridicule or belittle this data , but behind these numbers there 're real people suffering not just becouse of an opressive state , but also pathetic health care , poor diet and exhausting work for nothing . 
   no polish genocide [ o'rly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_%281937%e2%80%9338%29 ) ? 
  and just [ btw ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_%281939%e2%80%9346%29 ) . 
  how many people were sentenced to slave labour in pathetic conditions just becouse they had the `` wrong '' nationality ? 
  what would happend if stalin accepted the invitation to axis ? 
  every family in here , including mine , lost some relatives becouse of the national or international socialists , so do n't tell me that people had it easier here and for some strange reasons they should be thankful to a one side just becouse it won the war . 
  at least your gov was able to identyfie the bodies and treat them respecfully . 
  our current pm was a health minister them and she just lied in parliament that our pathologists were working with the russian ones . 
  several bodies had to be exhumated and still some families are n't sure where they relatives are burried . 
   `` to our russian brothers '' that was pathetic , but the same were goverment actions and naive words about `` reconcilliation '' or how trustworthy and professional russians are . 
  not to mention the whole paranoya about war and how opposition wants it , i 'd say that 's a one of the reasons for this opinions change and also the way that gov stays in power . 
  it was rather 2010 , between 2007 and 2009 opinions did n't change so much and later even returned to the previous level . 
  you 're welcomed . 
   used to be a single cell, 
  add also a lemon with sugar and you have an `` apple pie '' . 
  this and krupnik used to be my fav `` heavy '' drinks , now they 're selling some `` clean '' vodka for peanuts and i could n't buy a `` real '' \u017bubr\u00f3wka the last new year 's eve ... vodkas not so much , or i 'm just not much into this volume since i just heard again about baczewski . 
  it 's a waste . 
  eating would be much more efficient and really convinient , we could all be farmers . 
  not sure if to envy or to be happy that i 've travelled just around the europe . 
  in hungary i was just for two days and tried wine , but a very common carlova\u0107ko in croatia was quite okay . 
  some czech and german are aviliabe in poland , spanish were suprisingly nice . 
  never tried asian or american , but euro beer is the best for sure . 
  harna\u015b used to be ... worse , but it 's still cheap . 
  mi\u0142os\u0142aw for 2,5 is also a good deal . 
  cheers , 
  we 're taking care of them and i 'm proud that my university ( sggw ) participates . 
  they live mostly in bia\u0142owie\u017ca national park , the last prime forest of europe . 
  support local breweries !, 
  \u017bubr\u00f3wka as well as krupnik were sold to russians , most of formerly polish beers were bought by carlsberg or heineken and ... destroyed . 
  theese `` mainstream '' beers taste like piss . 
  12 weeks of ... life ? 
  i thought that feeding is a biological function . 
  zygote is not a cell . 
  i 'm not pretending , i 'm just trying to use reason and science i my arguments , but i 'm just a. . . human and we 're all imperfect . 
  except for that teratoma is a tumor , as you 've mentioned ... 
  still i 'm not sure if you mean `` fertilized egg '' as a fertilised ovum in the short time before the fusion of nucleuses and mitotic division . 
  nice picture , but it 's not yet a `` human-shaped clump of cells '' . 
  no idea what 's your point anyway . 
  wait , you just said it 's not human , so why not to `` recycle '' it ? 
  well , to be honest they 're `` recycled '' ... the corpses of `` aborted '' humans from canada are being used as a bio-mass in some american power plants . 
  i just love the `` progress '' . 
  nothing , but this is just a manipulation and outdated term in these days . 
  secular people can be also religious , but in this case `` secularisation '' means just that they and their opinions are ignored or in extreme cases , persecuted to make space for competing beliefs or ideologies . 
  btw . 
  why just catholicism ? 
  you know there 're other religions and culths , some of them directly participating in politics and some heads of states are still religious leaders ( protestants ) . 
  why is just a one religion such a big problem for the `` progress '' ? 
  yes , they are . 
  the very word `` mammal '' indicates that these organisms are dependent on mother 's milk , infants are not capable of digesting many proteins , but they can feed on those in milk . 
  i would n't separate biological functions from the social , ecology ( the real one ) is a discpiline that deals with it . 
  are you also talking about the homeless , unemployed and the other people dependent on the taxpayers ? 
  not sure , but i have a theory . 
  apparently the people on this subreddit ca n't tolerate anyone that is not lefty enough and it really does n't matter if you write obvious truth , recall facts or just make some argument . 
  if you do n't follow the one and only ideology , you 're the enemy . 
  no , i was n't . 
  i 'm clearly talking about an organism , not a somatic , nor a gamete cell . 
  not just that , virus ca n't reproduce on its own . 
  parasites and symbiotes are also living organisms , but this is not the case especially , and i repeat that for another time , immature mammals are dependent on their parents for a long time after birth . 
  universal suffrage , 8 hours workday , employing kids not allowed and so on ... all that communist occupation added was `` secularism '' , or rather anticlerical repressions and `` welfare '' ment as a redistribution of stolen goods , especially amongst communists themselves . 
  ah , so i see the lefty ideas are the `` progress '' , then i guess we have no choice but to follow blindly ... 
  communism did n't introduced these things , at least not in poland where they existed already . 
  all of the species distinguish their specimens from the others . 
  as social creatures we 're capable of egoist or altruist behaviors and feeling empathy . 
  i would n't say that homo sapiens is the `` best '' , but it 's my specie . 
   the beliefs of individuals should n't be the basis except for those represented by the `` progressives '' . 
  the way they 're presenting , or rather advertising , their position is not just abusive for the opposition , but just wrong . 
  neutrality is just an utopy . 
  in this context `` secularisation '' or `` neutralisation '' of the state means just exclusion of some people and ideas from participation . 
  reproduction and life are pretty well defined by biology and not dependent on any consensus , ideology or religion .
