  we know how and when the human life begins , it 's not subjective and should n't be in question here . 
  what we 're discussing is more a justyfication to terminate that life . 
  i keep hearing about that famous `` progress '' and still i do n't know what 's that ... sure i must be blind to not see the `` bright future '' predetermined in accordiance to some ideology . 
  i guess i should be shoving ideology instead , prefereably the `` correct '' one . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  so it 's not the posession of a skin which makes a human ? 
  or are you sugessting that whoever a human depends on should have a right to `` abort '' it ? 
  should n't it be a father 's `` busyness '' as well ? 
  indeed communism was a `` progress '' ... they actually used this slogan as frequently as you do to advertise their policies . 
  but it 's not a discussion about my simple person , it was just not elegant and unnecessary . 
  i do n't feel offended , but also i know that for leftys `` ultraconservative '' is an insult and i guess your intention was to discredit me and picture as a biased fanatic . 
  is it the `` reasonable position '' that you reserved for yourselve ? 
  not me , i just used a common name for a specie in question . 
  should i write ` homo sapiens ' instead ? 
  obviously it is , which does n't make me wrong in any way . 
  why would n't you adress me personally instead of making up `` accusations '' and stuff ? 
  you 're doing exactly what / u/lupinechemist was writing about and this is not just a one subject in which far left replace discussion with empty slogans or just insults . 
  another brilliant comparation ... 
  if you know a better definition of a human , then please provide it . 
  i was making no definitions . 
  thanks for advice , but i 've studied biology long enough . 
  in this case i think it should be mother 's decission . 
  there was a case in poland of a volleyball player agata mr\u00f3z , she was diagnosed with cancer and she refused chemiotherapy to not affect the baby . 
  she died unfortunatelly , but her baby survived . 
  yes , but we 're talking about our own specie . 
  i 've said it already before , but anyway humans have no self awarness until about 3rd year after birth . 
  besides , consciousness in this context is more a `` philosphical '' idea and its definition can change . 
  you 're obviously [ wrong ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human ) . 
  would you eat a `` human-shaped clump of cells '' ? 
  i do n't quite get your point . 
   medical exactly what hippocrates thought . 
  it is related to the `` argument '' that you 're making about dependence of immature organism . 
  skin develops between 5-8th week of life . 
  i used to be . 
  from the first mitotic division it fulfills all the conditions of a living organism . 
  every organism is a `` clump of cells '' and not just humans have nervous or circulatory systems . 
  if i 'd be a bacteria , than maybe i would . 
  no , since i was n't talking about just any specie . 
  [ it is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_body ) . 
  mammals are dependent on their parents for a much longer time than pregnancy . 
  i just love that `` progressive '' determinism ... 
  humans have no self awarness until about 3rd year after birth . 
  foetus is an organism during embryogenesis that resembles morphology of a mature organism . 
  obviously it 's a separate body . 
  no idea what 's a `` moral puritanism '' , but first there should be a right to `` aborth '' humans to be taken away . 
  it 's not an extreme example , that 's exactly what unwanted pregnancy is and i 'm not sure if it 's reasonable to punish humans for their parents deeds . 
  i could consider it as an execption , but still there 's nothing `` positive '' about that . 
  and what 's so positive about `` aborting '' humans ? 
  there 're maybe some neogothic elements , but it 's not pure gothic and it 's not medieval at all . 
  i should visit lw\u00f3w someday and \u0141yczak\u00f3w is obviously a one place to see , but also [ pow\u0105zki ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=powazki+cemetery&amp;biw=1652&amp;bih=956&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=jmahvz-gpmm7ovkwgogc&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ) in warsaw are not bad . 
  there 're also two protestant , one judaic and even a little muslim graveyard there . 
  in the same neighborhood there 's also an orthodox and karaite cementary . 
  in xixc , after partitions , russians did n't allow monuments and sculptures to be rised , graveyrds were the one exception . 
  so if it 's about the brain , then i repeat that many animals also posess it . 
  are they ... humans ? 
  dude , first you start some pathetic personal attacks and just becouse i 'm ignoring that with sarcasm it 's me who 's `` emotional '' ? 
  you 're also making up stuff , i was never implying such things . 
  still developing , just like in the whole process of embryogenesis . 
  also , i 've said it before that the animals also have these organs . 
  no idea what are you talking about . 
  my point exactly . 
  ok , why then underdeveloped , premature fetuses are being taken care of ? 
  they 'd not be able to survive on their own , actually no human would for many years after birth . 
   i was right . 
  sure , as always . 
  well , the point of every discussion is to proove your opinions and persuade the opposite side , but usually it 's impossible . 
  the `` material '' aspect is secondary and the whole discussion is about a definition of a human , at least i hope nobody justyfies killing becouse of material or mediacal conditions . 
  so the difference is not about survival , as you 've said , but about the developement of medicine ? 
  you 're such a nice guy , my hero ... 
  still it 's all about the money . 
  sorry , you 'll never convince me that it 's better for a human to be `` aborted '' instead of living in poverty or in the orphanage . 
  sure , ecology ( the real one ) is also about social interactions and as for `` justyfication '' , it 's survival as always . 
  there 're defintions of a life , organism or a specie ( human for example ) so lets say that 's `` my '' idea of a human . 
  ... i was born two weeks before the date , without medical care i would n't survive and same goes for millions of others . 
  so if it 's all about survival , why are n't those premature kids `` aborted '' ? 
  and still you do n't see how your argument was false ? 
  you 're just giving example how ridiculous can be some ideology and how the human laws can contradict not just the nature , but a common sense . 
  obviously you may say that i also have some `` philosophy '' and i 'm obviously against `` aborting '' humans . 
  it may be just an inherited empathy , typical for the social species . 
  this is sick ... are you seriously saying that 's a favor for the kid to be `` aborted '' becouse of money ? 
  there 're orphanages for those who ca n't afford a condom . 
  ok , so what 's the `` personhood '' ? 
  are there animals which posess it finally , or not ? 
  i 'm sceptical if it goes for philosophic , ideologic or religious arguments . 
  apes or dolphins are n't humans , so if your point was to define a `` human '' then you should really change those criteria . 
  still i 'm quite sure that many animals fulfill those conditions . 
  sorry , i do n't belive in creationism . 
  survival of the fittest ... what about those premature births ? 
  what for we actually need hospitals ? 
  what 's a `` human being '' ? 
  you just wrote that a human organism is still underdeveloped in the 5th week and you should also know that humans mature and dvelop for many years after their birth . 
  besides , you ca n't say exactly on which day this organism becomes a `` human '' . 
  many other species have central nervous system , are they also `` persons '' ? 
  obviously if the life of a mother is at stake , then she should decide , but this is not the `` human '' right that we 're talking about . 
  ok , so how long a human needs to survive on its own to be granted these `` rights '' ? 
  wikipedia is not a primary source , if you wants more , follow the linked sources . 
  i thought you was talking about the human body . 
  is elimination of underdeveloped or handicaped human organisms `` etchical '' ? 
  what does make a `` personhood '' ? 
  does n't matter anyway , it 's all subjective and dependent on personal beliefs or ideology .
