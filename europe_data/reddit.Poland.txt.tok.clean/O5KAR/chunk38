  first tell me what 's a `` person '' , i 'm not a philosopher . 
   fertilized egg fertilisation is a process in which an offspring organism is created . 
  you 're obviously [ wrong ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_body ) . 
   technically no , they are n't . 
  mammals are dependent on their parents for quite a long time , years in case of humans . 
  also , what about those who were born prematurely and survived just becouse of medical care ? 
  but until then you 're not a human , if we follow your `` definition '' . 
  do you live on your own , or are you still a `` parasite '' to your parents ? 
  so what they 're driven by ? 
  i guess that 's their honest care for the poor and sick people , if they want to spare their `` suffering '' and eliminate them , that must be a reasonable thing to do ... 
  so it 's all about the number of cells ? 
  that makes alot of sense ... how many of cells should the human organism have to be considered a `` human '' ? 
  ok , sorry if i sound bitter , but also i 'd like to understand what is considered a `` human '' in these `` rights '' . 
  do you know the difference between gamete and an organism ? 
  i 'm tierd of listening to empty slogans and failed comparations . 
  also , every organism is a `` cluster of cells '' . 
  the way of thinking in which nature can be replaced by a `` social agreement '' is typically left . 
  i 'm still waiting for a lefty definition of a human . 
  it contradicts the biologic one , so i 'd feel better to know who can enjoy these `` human '' rights . 
  i refuse to accept these `` arguments '' as i do n't think that poor , sick or `` unwanted '' humans should be `` aborted '' . 
  this way of thinking is amoral , inhuman and just disgusting . 
  of course i 'm biased and i 'm not afraid to defend my opinions , fortunatelly the people share my views , as i 've said . 
   according to your view . 
  no , not just according to his view , but to the science which you 're all just babbling about ... 
  it 's just annoying how lefty arrogants consider their ideas and inventions as `` scientific '' , while they have no idea about it . 
  ffs read about fertilisation , embryogenesis , or at least definitions of an organism and life . 
   eggcell a human being ovum and this ridiculous , typical `` argument '' is the best proof that you ca n't tell a difference between gamete and organism . 
  i thought you have biology lessons in belgain schools ... 
  ... `` aborting '' humans is allowed in russia and that 's a country with record numbers of it . 
  putin is a `` conservative '' just and only in his or the lefty propaganda . 
  really ? 
  the `` christian '' democrates since a long time are lefty , or just cynical , opportunist and corrupted by the leftys to support their inventions . 
  depends where . 
  in poland vast majority of people are against `` aborting '' humans and just a little , noisy minority of far left radicals supports `` liberalisation '' of the law . 
  you 'll get my upvote , but ...  their body this is typical , but invalid `` argument '' , an offspring organism is a separate `` body '' . 
  fertilisation is by definition a process in which there 's created a separate organism . 
   gay rights marriages usually are granted some social and financial privillages , not rights . 
  personally i 'm not against the privillaged position of this particular kind of relationships , but against all of them . 
  so humans have a right to get `` aborted '' ... oh joy . 
  i just wonder , what are these `` humans '' according to far left ? 
  barszcz is a beta soup , there 're some ukrainian or polish variations , but not hungarian . 
  we have even a one that is seved cold in summer , just [ look ] ( http://zwegowani.pl/wp-content/uploads/chlodnik-litewski-z-botwinki.jpg ) . 
  are you serious ? 
  have you ever tried the spanish ham , or sausages ? 
  not to mention tortilla , croquetas or even paella ... mmmmmmmmmmm, 
  french is overrated , spanish is underrated . 
  the best is italian , but ... that 's just my opinion . 
  looks like [ dro\u017cd\u017c\u00f3wka ] ( http://www.kibalo.pl/media/1757/dro%c5%bcd%c5%bc%c3%b3wka_z_serem_thumb_1024.jpg ) . 
  [ ko\u0142acz ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ko%c5%82acz_%28pieczywo%29 ) used to be some `` ceremonial '' bread , or something . 
  there 's a chain of `` austro-hungarian '' restaurants in warsaw and the czech food is really good , especially bramborak . 
   land hoarding , education monopoly , misogyny , homosexual persecution , union ` busting ' land owning , instead of stealing , which was the `` republican '' regime doing , homosexual `` persecution '' by not granting them any special privillages ( horror ... ) and as for the `` misogyny '' i do n't know if universal suffrage and voting rights were cancelled . 
  education monopoly was exactly what `` republic '' was doing when it stole the church property , including schools and prohibited private education . 
  also , the `` republican '' regime was shooting to the protesting miners ... falanga was not even supported by franco . 
  i guess you still do n't get it , but it was the red terror and `` republican '' policies which made the people to rebel , without their support no conspiracy of franco , opus dei or whatever could succeed . 
  the way that lefty spaniards idealise the `` republic '' is just naive . 
   partners to be proud of . 
  better than stalin , who already prooved to be insane massmurder then . 
  then the national socialists did nothing special , not yet and as for the italian fascists , except for the war crimes in greece i do n't know about any other . 
  the connection is the mindset of left extreme and its agressive behavior . 
   crush a population again ... ca n't you understand that was a civil war and a big part of that population rebelled against the `` republican '' regime ? 
  what kind of `` regressive '' policies ? 
  especially the freedom of religion was a joke under the far lefty regime and red terror . 
  most of people `` collaborated '' . 
  not everybody shares these `` progressive '' ideas , it was a civil war , not a foreign invasion and obviously catholics and the church stood on a side which was n't persecuting them . 
   tortured or murdered for doing something out of the norm for example ? 
  btw . 
  if we 're speaking about the terrorist attacks , the far lefty gangs are still planting bombs in spanish churches , in xxic . 
  fortunatelly they failed to kill anybody . 
  fascists , fascists everywhere ... 
  seriously , what do you expect if the left extremists terrorised catholics and clergy ? 
  are you suprised that people rebelled and the church supported them ? 
  if propaganda and `` moral '' support are these `` atrocities '' then i guess everybody 's `` guilty '' on every side . 
  obviously . 
  ok , i agree the army based on conscription is archaic and ineffective , but the current size and structure is also bad . 
  out of 100.000 personel ( in theory ) most are burecrates . 
  ok , so there was indoctrination in the schools , as well as it is now . 
  that 's the `` atrocity '' you was talking about ? 
  so falangists were clerics ? 
  if you expect people to be terrorised , slaughtered and stay silent , then you must be insane . 
  i 'm not suprised that many spaniards reacted and opposed the left extremists and their regime , same as it was in mexico and many more countries , but those were the regular catholics , not clergy . 
  your accusations are groundles expressions of your ideological bias and phobies . 
   they defended and helped the falangists commit the red and white terrors how ? 
  there 's no spanish church , afaik franco was a pope just for his belivers . 
  do n't care what `` horrors '' they teach in private schools as long as my kids are n't there . 
  so what kind of crimes the `` christian '' church commited under el jefe paco ? 
  well , lets not forget that this gov , under donald but still the same , resigned from conscription . 
   equality and progressive i just love those lefty propaganda slogans ... 
  so called `` equality '' by segregation of the laws for the chosen minorities and determined `` progress '' measured by fulfillmnt of social experiments . 
  who cares about the equality in law and progress of science if we have all the solutions in a one ideology ? 
  victims of political corectness . 
  absolutelly . 
  i 'm a big fan of the swiss political traditions and i 'd love to see my country as peacefull and secure . 
  i 'm quite sure that if everybody here would own and know how to operate a rifle , then those russians or germans would think twice before another invasion . 
  [ niemyje-z\u0105bki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niemyje-z%c4%85bki )  fun fact : nie myje z\u0105bki means ` does n't brush the teeth ' in polish . 
  mi\u015b and this is diminutive , fits more a teddy bear than a real one . 
  i meat ruski , not contemporary russian and i guess the word is borrowed becouse it got corrupted and lost its meaning . 
  polish is quite conservative and never was reformed by any central goverment , but it has alot of borrowed words . 
  i guess that czechs just like their beer , 
  not so close , there 're theories about a common balto-slavic origin , but with few exceptions the languages are very different . 
  same in poland , the pressure of hre was dangerous and no `` pagan '' country could oppose for a longer time .
