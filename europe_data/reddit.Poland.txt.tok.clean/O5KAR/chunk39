  baptism just `` legalised '' the rulers in the international politics and gave them excuse for `` missions '' to the veleti or prussians . 
  piwnica in polish and indeed sounds like it 's connected to `` piwo '' . 
  rf never respected that treaty anyway , it 's just another empty threat of their `` diplomacy '' . 
  thanks , you was obviously right here . 
  in polish it 's `` tak '' and i think also in ukrainian . 
   sluha rather `` s\u0142uga '' , note that often `` h '' change to `` g '' in our languages , like hrad - gr\u00f3d ( also `` a '' to `` o '' or '' \u00f3 '' ) , hora - g\u00f3ra , hranica - granica etc. 
  nied\u017awied\u017a is a one of few borrowed rusin words we have , it makes no sense in polish . 
  in polish that 's `` mi\u00f3d '' and for both , the honey and the alcoholic beverage , the `` mead '' . 
  dunno , could be the opposite way , but there 's that relation for sure in every slavic language . 
  depends where . 
  st methodius was in krak\u00f3w , also sandomierz was a centre of eastern christianity here , but finally polans took over these lands and in the time of a schism they 've decided to cooperate with empire and especially the papacy . 
  lithuania was the last `` pagan '' land in europe , orthodoxy was also penetrating this territory and people were assimilating , but finally the lithuanian elite adopted latin catholicism . 
  in a way they were `` bribed '' by titles and gifts , but it was a peacefull process . 
   bo\u017cnica maybe , but this exact name was used for a jewish synagogue . 
  i 'm afraid that this word comes from rusins , who had much bigger impact on lithuania when it was getting christianised . 
  when and what was the true name then ? 
  medved means literally `` leading to mead '' , in polish `` nied\u017awied\u017a '' is a word borrowed from ruski and means nothing . 
  lithuanian and latvian names for a `` church '' are also of slavic origin . 
  b\u00f3g or boh means `` god '' and it comes from a word `` bogactwo '' ( richness ) . 
  yeah , they 're everywhere in europe , but from diferent periods of time and cultures . 
  do n't know where to get stones in lithuania , there 're no mountains , so i guess you 're talking about brick , like in trakai castle or gediminas tower . 
  yeah , but still there were about 10 % of these nobles , up to 40 % in masovia . 
  most of those people were just poor , but proud farmers . 
  not to mention that noble women were also allowed to succeed property and participate in politics , they just had to pay taxes . 
  taxes which were almost non existing and that was the real problem , regular army was very little and the ` lave en masse ' was disorganised and ineffective . 
  but the funiest thing is that the polish-lithuanian sejm was passing decissions by unanimous vote . 
  every single deputy had to agree on every law and it worked well for something like few hundrets years ... then people started to abuse it , called it `` liberum veto '' and paralysed legislative process . 
  i 've noticed that too . 
  in polish that 's `` czechy '' , but i 'm quite sure that `` czech republic '' is the proper english name . 
  english got crazy about neogothic , they 've built and rebuilt lots of places in this style . 
  watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm76cigj0uq ) . 
  wood was the only material we all had alot of , it 's much harder to get stones here and bricks were n't used yet . 
  there 're like thousands sites in poland with remains of these places ( we call them gr\u00f3d , in russian grad and czech is hrad ) , but that was x-xiic . 
  wood is not very resistant , but it could hold the invasions of hre . 
  so where have i misunderstood you ? 
  as for the russian tv , i 'm indeed watching it , so at least i know how naive were our beloved rulers . 
  do n't get trapped in some schemes and stereotypes , but most of all do n't loose your nerves . 
  are you paranoid , or you just do n't get it ? 
  french were about to attack on 16 september , they did n't and that 's why the soviets did invided a day after . 
  germans had almost no forces on the western front , they 've moved most of it to poland , so ask yourselve , would the soviets invide if germans were going to loose ? 
   that did n't even factor in soviet attack it did , that 's why they invided on 17 september , a day after les frogs were about to start an offensive . 
  read the article , find the keyword , serch for it , chill ... pap is just a polish press agency , something life afp or interfax . 
  they just cite the other sources . 
  silly , but painful if you look at the whole , not just a part , of the dispute . 
  same way i could say that czechoslovakia was helping the bolsheviks when poland fought them and barely survived . 
  poland had nothing to say in munich , it just acted in a cynical , opportunist ... dirty way . 
  our foremr president sincerly [ apologised ] ( http://www.warsawvoice.pl/wvpage/pages/article.php/20908/article ) for that and i 'm sure that most of people could agree with him on this matter . 
  it 's annoying how this border conflict is exploit by the nazi and soviet cheerleaders . 
   international community you mean chamberlain , daladier ( france was allied to czechoslovakia ) , mussolini and hitler ? 
  nobody asked those `` dicks '' if we can take disputed lands , suck it . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/digital-economy-and-society-index-desi ) so what 's wrong about this source ? 
  politicians will be the first to flee , again to london i guess . 
  what about the duchy of courland and semigallia or the inflanty voivodeship ? 
  terrible ivan got some spanking there . 
  lithuania , traditionally . 
  never heard about that , but czechs are once again [ the most favorite ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/199434,poll-finds-poles-like-czechs-slovaks-germans-best ) neighbour . 
  i always thought that czechs do n't like us . 
  this is a nice suprise . 
  \u017burek should be with a white sausage and/or an egg . 
  also , it should be made with [ this ] ( http://readeat.pl/kiszenie-zuru-czyli-jak-zrobic-domowy-zakwas-na-zurek/ ) ( no idea about the english name ) serving is the same . 
  meh ... no resources , water deficit and most of soils are sands . 
  no idea why germans and russians always wants this land , but we do n't have any other . 
  i 'm not an expert , but it seems that you 're confusing pederasty with pedophilia and i 'm repeating that this survey is about `` sex '' or whatever it can be called in this case . 
  that 's not what i mean and you know it . 
  i do n't even mean the physical assaults against the regular catholics or churches which is also happening , but just about offensive comments on some lefty forums that would never be allowed towards muslims or jews ... 
  in which way ? 
  only word ? 
  that 's kinda boring ... 
  i 'm not equating anything , the whole point of this survey was about `` gay sex '' . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  i converted when i married cynthia !, 
  come on , dude !, 
  hre was not really a theocratic state , you could rather add some teutonic or livonian order states . 
  that 's an ancient history anyway , but i just loled when i 've heard that the danish church was suddenly ordered by the king or whatever that they have to give marriages to the homosexuals . 
  not just this and that , there 're far too many examples to write here , but the point is that there 's no way it 's going to work if every country has different interests and identity which you 're not going to change just by some central policy . 
  well , sure you can try to force your ideas on everybody , but they 'll not like it so you should think first if it 's really worth it . 
  we have nato , that 's more than enough and honestly , i have doubts about mentality and interests of some eu states considering the external and internal dangers so having some alliance with isolated usa is a good option . 
  ehhh the question was which christians wants to ban pederasty . 
  it 's not like every russian is a christian so even if we forget that there 's some hierarchy and actually priests says what 's `` haram '' , these opinion polls are not what i was asking for . 
  i do n't really care if they are or are n't `` true '' christians , but the point is if they are at all . 
  slovakia is catholic , the catholic church does not want to ban sodomy . 
  again you brings some crazy americans and aborting people is not even related to that , especially if only sexual intercourse leads to reproduction . 
  to be honest , me neither , but that 's how it works ... 
  some ngo declared to propose some draft about preventing abortions of people , conservative politicians said that they 're against terminating people , church repeated that it 's also against it and some leftist medias with few leftist organisations pretends to be shocked . 
  who knows , who cares , but the show must go on !, 
  ok , what happened about these laws ? 
  sorry , i do n't know if anybody was polling people if they wants to be occupied and controlled by a puppet gov again . 
  about what exactly ? 
  the attitude of poles towards eu , or the `` refugees '' ? 
  do n't we have a common foreign minister and president since the ~ ~ constitution ~ ~ lisbon treaty was enforced on member states ? 
  we also have a military alliance and i do n't think that we should repeat mistakes of habsburgs . 
  poland is quite pro eu too , even if it 's changing a bit thanks to the retarded migrant policy of germans and paranoid reaction here . 
  the people likes common market , freedom of work and movement , but ... they 'll not accept another foreign dictate . 
  actually i have no idea what that `` political union '' is , but i can guess what are the wet dreams of internationalists . 
  ok sodomy , better ? 
  seriously , it 's not about some telepathic mind checking , but about erotic acts . 
  so what happened now ? 
  as much as i find it disrespectful for the women ... what about these mormons that you have in america ? 
  and aborting people is morally all right , but anyway the question was and i repeat , was the russian orthodox church calling for ban of pederasty ? 
  about 30-40 % russians never [ attended church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_attendance ) in their lives and few attends it even in most important holydays .
