  we all know very well about it , but the question was what hungary did and i do n't see how assistance from romania cancells the help from hungary or ruins anything . 
  you forgot [ inflanty voivodeship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inflanty_voivodeship ) , which in opposite to the duchy of courland , was an integral part of poland . 
  both never were swedish and i do n't really know what harm did we ever done to latvians . 
   stood by and watched the nazis conquer poland [ not exactly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#world_war_ii ) , but we do n't mess in each others politics . 
  also there were about 100.000 polish refugees in hungary and thousands of `` tourists '' crossing to france ( they went even through italy ) , there were even polish schools in hungary during wwii . 
  when warsaw uprising broke out in 1944 some hungarians defected and joined the polish forces . 
  moreover , there were secret negotiations between home army and hungarian command if not to transfer the whole corp of 20.000 men under polish command , but german intelligence intercepted messages and ordered hungarians to move out of poland . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/3/37/main_countries_of_citizenship_and_birth_of_the_foreign_foreign-born_population%2c_1_january_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_%28in_absolute_numbers_and_as_a_percentage_of_the_total_foreign_foreign-born_population%29_yb15.png ) , citizens of poland , which means the recent migrants and indeed i confused it so excuse my mistake . 
  similar with denmanrk , except that polish born people are second after german . 
  catholic , rural , heavy drinking population ... hmmm, 
  like it 's with irish ? 
  doubt so . 
  ... about a million ukrainians would disagree . 
  there 's this irrational paranoya , but it 's hard to blame people when they see what 's happening in western europe . 
  they 're worried just about islamic immigrants , but they 're not coming , fortunatelly . 
  hey , it 's just norway , britain , ireland , netherlands and iceland ... so far . 
   bacon and cabbage boil it together with prunes , mushrooms , spices and you have bigos , traditional polish cuisine . 
  you forgot ukrainian season workers , some belarussian minority in podlasie and germans in upper silesia . 
  not to mention kashubians and silesians . 
  besides , it 's not like adolf and joseph asked the people to die or move out , so you can thank these two gentlemen ... 
  i see , excuse my ignorance . 
  it should be somehow banned or controlled , or rather its components , but anyway something has to be done to restrict access to the explosives if they 're really that easy to manufacture . 
  you misunderstood me , immigrants should be integrated to the local culture . 
  interesting . 
  i thought that this kind of explosives needs big containers and ca n't be smuggled so easy . 
  that 's like a definition of terror from a dictionary . 
  the idea is to scare , terrorize people and ut worked for example in case of spain which pulled out of iraq after madrid bombings . 
  in case of france the effect was opposite and the same as belgium , it was n't very active , at least not in this part of muslim world . 
  it could be just a general message to the whole europe and eu , considering the proximity of the most important institutions and kinda simbolic `` capital '' . 
  isis is just a manifestation , an armed wing of the whole `` ideology '' or radical branch of religion and its defeat will not end the whole problem . 
  and what point would that be ? 
  omfg ... read the damn comments again and again until you understand what i was writing about . 
  so this is the case here ? 
  i guess we 'll never know because some informations ca n't be published . 
  they 're rationalising it , some terrorist atacks can be also `` rational '' at least because of separatism , even if they 're directed usually against civillians , but in this case ... ? 
  the only `` reason '' is heavy islamic brainwashing . 
  i advice education and assimilation , not crazy tolerance . 
  america could sucessfully integrate people of various desecents because they were actually creating a common identity in an active way and i do n't mean to create an internationalist `` european '' identity because that 's another failed project . 
  it 's late , but it should be done from the very beginning , strict and severe punishments for crimes and expulsion of offenders to their countries of origin , but ut 's not possible with second - third generations which grew in thier own ghettos . 
  duh , they organise terrorist attacks in turkey . 
  ... not the first one and because of political reasons ( separatism ) , not religious . 
  somehow i doubt that you can get weapons and explosives that easy , this is more complicated and i guess they 're imported , you need to have contacts in order to get it . 
  i agree they have local support , families , friends and whole communities supporting them and their cause from which there 're recruiting terrorists and syrian `` tourists '' . 
  this is also relevant , it 's not just another criminal case with `` rational '' , egoist reasons . 
  shia muslims , alavites and in general whoever is opposing , but there 's a difference between a genocide and a war . 
  apparently not for everybody . 
  in xixc poles considered german assimilation as the most dangerous because they were developed and `` professional '' , the russians were ... not , even if tried hard . 
  i guess it was easier with tatars , mordvins , ossetians and countless number of the other , clearly non russian etchnic groups and nations ... 
  in opposite to the `` western '' leftys , the sunni muslims can clearly see religious differences and christians ca n't even defend against ** religiously ** motivated violence , not to mention that they 're not attacking * infidels * . 
  maybe you 're right , but for the other hand the support , logistics and especially ideology or religion are not just local . 
  only the people are and yes , they seem to not identifiy themselfs as belgians and do n't integrate , but they immigrate and stay just because of living standards and money . 
  so why are you using this comparation ? 
  i guess because lots of people does it and also because it provokes a certain , emotional reaction , but still it does not explain anything . 
  nobody says it is , but it 's a tragedy and serious problem in general . 
  checked and it seems you 're right , he 's not considered as a form of diety and i just confused it . 
  still i 've never heard islamists preeching about second coming of jesus to justify their actions and even if many refuse to admit that , there 's ongoing just a christian genocide in middle east . 
  not long enough occupation of russia and soviets . 
   despite the global vision of the extremist ideologues and the portrayal of groups such as islamic state and al-qaida as international , however , such activism is fundamentally local . 
  bullcrap , islam and its radicalisation is global and these two of many organisations are just armed wings of the whole movement . 
  these people are `` local '' just because of their residence , but not because of their identity , religion or ideology , which are the primary reasons for their actions . 
   jesus except that he 's not considered a messiah in islam or judaism , but just another of many prophets . 
   you 're from poland , you should know about anti democratic regimes yes , we all know about the far lefty regime , but the same east germans should know it . 
  except that there was barely 500.000 jews in germany back then and they were n't violent or criminal , unlike many muslims . 
  spain is quite safe , not sure about italy , it was many years ago when i was visiting . 
  i know it 's not the `` hottest '' tourist destination , but just google pictures of these cities , i visited all of them and many more all around europe . 
  prague is probably the nicest town i 've ever seen . 
  also , this whole region is really cheap in comparation to western europe . 
  unfortunatelly nobody is , but it would be very unlikely here for that and the other reasons . 
  same goes for czech rep. slovakia and hungary . 
  if you wants to travel , you should know that some of the nicest cities in europe are prague , budapest and krak\u00f3w , also vienna but i guess it 's full of arabs and north africans now . 
  forget about paris , it 's not safe and not really nice anymore . 
  i 'm sorry to sound `` racist '' , but every single brown skinned person in poland will stand out from the crowd and people will be suspicious , including police . 
  there was a case recently , two dutch nationals tried to buy ak-47 and a pistol in gdynia , they thought that it 's 90s or some wild country and they can just bribe someone to sell them guns without permits and serial numbers ... 
  they were wrong and it was easy to catch them because they did not look like `` locals '' . 
  sweden is hopeless ... edit : or you 're just sarcastic, 
   daesh has managed to slip into europe in high numbers it 's their ideology , the people were here already , often since one or two generations . 
  now it 's rather the opposite way , thousands of these people are travelling to syria in order to join their unholy war . 
  not whole europe is endangered by islamic terrorism and it 's not a new phenomenon , unfortunatelly terrorism exists since a long time . 
  and before that there were attacks in madrid and london . 
  depends , if it 's going to work like the other common institutions then maybe no . 
  more and more borders are getting closed and the external was leaking for a long time with demoralising support of european left . 
  i 'm sorry to say , but we have to stop being sentimental and get serious , there ca n't be any more denial or tolerance for criminals and radical preachers or activists . 
  should we feel better bacuse of that ? 
  most of these terrorists attacks then were commited by ira and eta . 
  residents which were not integrated , but `` tolerated '' and allowed to close in ghettos , to become petty criminals , to be radicalised by other terrorists and insane imams . 
  there shoudl be ** zero tolerance ** for that . 
  i 'm not decided on this issue , there 's always some risk , but it 's higher in crowded places like aiports , metro or stadiums because that 's the whole idea of terrorists , to cause as many casualties as possible . 
  there 's always some risk and we ca n't just close aiports , train stations , metro , concerts and sport events all around europe . 
  common intelligence goes with common military , but its activity is rather concentrated on states , not the other political organisations or terrorists . 
  we have nato , for sure intelligence and other services are cooperating . 
  there 's interpol , europol and maybe we need more of such services , but most of all ... they need to be effectvie and allowed to work , which means that we need to sacrifice part of our freedom for security . 
  sure we can lie to ourself and pretend that terrorists capable of gathering explosives and organising attacks on secured airport and metro station at the same time were just accidental people ... 
  i hope that belgian and european services are not that naive and do n't sacrifice our security for some ridiculous political correctness . 
  i 've heard it 's considered if not to play games without audience , but it 's also showing that we give up to terror and we should n't . 
  we should fight it . 
  i was really surprised to learn that muslim terrorists can escape and hide in belgium , to plot their attacks , communicate with islamic `` state '' and travel to syria without any control ... 
  right under our nose , next to the most important eu institutions . 
  both attacks happend right next to the buildings of ec , council of eu and ep is also quite close . 
  i know , because some people actually watched the video . 
  i 'd say the guy is trolling your whole far left mindset and he 's doing it well , also because he 's showing the sad reality that yout 're bent on denying .
