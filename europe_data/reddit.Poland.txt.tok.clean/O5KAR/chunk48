  true and i 'm a one of ignorants , so i 'm not going to talk about any other party except the one i actualy know . 
  the problem here is also that the `` knowledge '' often comes from such biased and quite primitive sources , incapable or unwilling to describe policies and processes , but rather throwing accusatiuons , often groundles . 
  i was not talking about `` reasons '' . 
  excuse me , but using reproductive organs with other tools or non reproductive organs is not sexual intercourse and serves just for statysfying urges , or `` pleasure '' if you prefere . 
  misleading title , it should be `` right-wing populist demonic and backwarded parties that only idiots votes for '' ... 
  seriously , i doubt that the info about the other countries could be believeable when i can clearly see that the one about poland is not . 
  constitutional tribunal is not a part of justice system , but rather legislative body and public media never were independent here . 
  r e p r o d u c t i o n. 
  make polan stronk again !, 
  i guess it depends , for sure mraps are lighter and more mobile , but caterpillar tracks are better for difficult terrain . 
  i 'm no expert , but there 's a reason why many armies are using both kinds of vehicles , including poland which has [ amz dzik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amz_dzik ) and develops replacemnt like [ amz tur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amz_tur ) . 
  ifvs can also use wheels and they can resist mines like [ this one ] ( http://wzms.pl/static/upload/album/21/105-big.jpg ) . 
  ridiculous , as i 've said ... you can find many things in the nature , some of them are irrational . 
  it happends everywhere and everybody can be discriminated for many different reasons , not just the chosen ones . 
  all countries in europe also discriminate some people when they sanction `` positive discrimnation '' of the others , or just privillages . 
  i did , exactly in the same way you 've done it , but maybe i was n't clear enough . 
  also , i absolutelly agree with your comment . 
  ... you 're running in circles . 
  besides , you just mentioned killing and i was referring to the general definition of discrimination . 
  this is ridiculous ... 
  i repeat that biological function of sex is reproduction , there 's eventually a social one , but pleasure is just and only a natural encouragement , a side effect . 
  you have plenty of options to satify your urges , but just a one is sexual . 
  yes and these people are somewhere on arabic desert , except for those that are welcomed in europe ... everybody can be discrimnated for many different reasons , which is against the law and everybody should be equally protected by the state services from criminals and these should be judged fairly , even if they 're members of some specially protected and privillaged minorities . 
  you do n't need special laws for different groups of people , unless you wants to create an elitarist society . 
  tax free inheritance , a one household income tax ... just to list few privillages given to institutionalised relationships in poland , in other countries it 's probably different . 
  how not to `` mix '' reproduction with sex ? 
  it 's social functions like relationships are different matter . 
  in contrary to some `` progresive '' inventions , there 're two genders of humans , therefore there 's a one sexual orientation , other relationships are not sexual . 
  sorry , i 've made some quick edit to the previous comment . 
  depends in which legal system . 
  my personal opinion is that unstead of expanding privillages on the other groups of people , these should be cancelled in general . 
  a state should not sanction any relationships , nor grant them privillages and if there 's censorship of so called `` hate speech '' , then it should applie equally to everybody , not just to the chosen ones . 
  it 's never enough for some people , no matter what kind of rights and privillages they get . 
  edit : it 's not about civic rights , which are equal for everybody in every european state , but about specyfic rights for this or the other social , workers or `` sexual '' group . 
  that 's not egalitarism . 
  you need a sexual intercourse ( heterosexual , if that 's not clear ) . 
  pleasure is just a side effect , a strategy to attract specimens to each other . 
  you can get a pleasure with a plastic toy or yourself as well , but it 's not a ** sexual ** interaction . 
  i repeat , there 's just a one sexual orientation when specie has two sexual forms , genders if you prefere . 
  sexual reproduction is a strategy to diversify gene pool , but there 're as well species with more than two genders , as well as bisexual , hermaphrodite and some forms of asexual breeding . 
  there 're people which dislikes some other people , lets give them more rights ... and do n't you dare question their demands , you evil `` phobe '' . 
  no , because that 's actually the only sexual orientation , which means that it leads to reproduction . 
  there 's no consesus about the origins of homosexual preferrences . 
  i thought that freedom of speech and belief is a `` human right '' , but apparently the right to not be `` offended '' is more important when it 's about some chosen people . 
   lgbt people are treated bad yeah , maybe in saudi arabia . 
  in europe that 's just martyrologic rhetorics used for politicial purposes . 
   against and again , this time with typical martyrology ... 
  i wrote it quite clearly that i have no idea if it is or is n't a disease and until that 's determined in scientific way , without political , ideologic or religious bias , then both claims are equally unsupported . 
   neurology sure ... 
  it 's some issue anyway and no plastic surgery or hormonal therapy can cure it . 
  following this way of reasoning we can assume that masturbation is as well a sexual orientation because everybody has a one of two genders . 
   bronze age views and that 's what i was complaining about ... 
  i 'm afraid you misunderstood me , i do n't care for religions or ideologies in this matter , but rather about some serious scientific studies which would determinate beyond doubt the background of these preferrences and behaviors . 
  to say that it 's not a `` disease '' just because some influential people feel offended is not enough . 
  apparently , if decissions like that are made by voting in who . 
  they forgot to exclude transsexualism from the list of menthal disorders , but i 'm quite sure it 's just a matter of time . 
  of course , i 've said it in another comment and i was never making up any criteria of what 's healthy or not . 
  depends how you define `` sucess '' , in biology that 's survival and reproduction , no idea why you assume from the start that homosexual individuals have to have siblings ... 
  there 're such behaviors amongst the prime apes , but usually it 's just temporal and not a continuos `` orientation '' , sometimes just a social behavior to determinate the hierarchy in tribe . 
  eh , my bad ... english is not my mother tongue and still i 'm learning it . 
  that was a honest mistake and i apologise if anyone feels offended . 
  for the other hand , there 's some ideology around involved in this issue . 
  maybe , i guess that politics already corrupted biology since i was studying it . 
  a person ? 
  i agree , there 's no reason to use the term `` sexual orientation '' in this case . 
  the concept of sexual orientation applies not just to the people . 
  sexual orientation is attraction to a ** different ** sex , gender if you prefer , which leads to sexual reproduction . 
  there 're species with more than two genders and thus , more than a one sexual orientation . 
  yes , as you can see in the title of this post . 
   uneducated i 'm quite sure they 'll be indoctrinated sooner or later and bullied to not question the dogma . 
  no idea if this is or is n't a disease or another disorder , i doubt that in this political climate it 's possible to investigate it or discuss without facing consequences . 
  in this situation opinions that it is a pathology are as good as opposite claims , that it 's natural and healthy behavior , the first one is just sanctioned with `` backwarded '' or another labels pinned by pc crusaders . 
  apparently it is for some political activists . 
  no offence , but people reproduce sexually and teasing reproductive organs in whichever other way serves different purposes . 
  unless that 's just a temporary behavior , or that specimen has a low rank in the tribe and others just hmmm ... express their domination . 
  what narrative ? 
  you mean the facts i 've mentioned and you ignored ? 
  i 've tried and there 's no google translate version of this article , but anyway i do n't really care about it , it does n't matter what some former ambassador said or if someone asked putin to order yanukovych to do something when he clearly did n't done it . 
  excuse me , but it 's a pain for someone who does n't use cirrilic everyday to get throgh a longer text . 
  if that would be something relevant , it will be in english or polish medias as well . 
  now , as for judgements , you 're confronting here some alleged declarations of an ambassador with facts and real actions of yanukovych which do n't support these claims . 
  you ca n't expect people to know every opinion , article or interview on this or any other complex matter . 
  what matters are facts , not opinions . 
  i do n't know this language and do n't know what your quotes are about . 
  nevermind the rumors , gossips or whatever , yanukovych did not resigned and did not followed the agreement so , either he was not listening to putin , or rather listened and that was what he was told to do . 
  that 's again , not a serious issue , nobody can be responsible for someones ignorance or imagination . 
  the people had many legitimate reasons to protest , but the whole idea was more a general , strategic choice for the future of the country . 
   other way around military alliance was not an issue of the protests , even if it could be a consequence of taking a different direction in politics . 
  the real issue is another country in which moscow was loosing its influence in favour of the `` west '' and instead of letting it resolve by itself with time ( like with `` orange revolution '' ) , this time kremlin decided it ca n't control and `` invest '' in relations with ukraine anymore . 
  decission about interim gov of yatsenyuk , reversion of the constitution , resignation and elections was made by yanukovych and then approoved by vast majority of parliament . 
  elected representatives never represent everybody , they can decide just in a name of majority . 
  crimea is integral part of ukraine and the illegal referendum was possible only because of russian invasion and occupation , no matter if majority would vote to secede anyway . 
  with syria for sure and possibly iran , but not russia . 
  i know , it 's written in the article . 
  thanks , but that 's what i knew already . 
  it 's just elections and declarations , but i 'd rather judge these people after their deeds , unless some have absolutelly no experience . 
   cruz is a religious maniac huh ? 
   confirmed source ? 
  yanukovych did not resigned , he did n't even sign the bill to restore 2004 constitution . 
  russian ambassador opposed the agreement with opposition , he was present there , but did not sign the document .
