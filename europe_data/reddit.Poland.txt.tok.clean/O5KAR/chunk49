  do n't provoke , do n't interfere in our politics or relations and do n't exploit resentiments . 
  then i agree in this point , but it applies just to hillary , or is there something i do n't know about the other candidates ? 
  except that she was appointed quite a bit of time before and was not official of us administration when she said these words . 
  it has the same , or even lower `` importance '' than opinions of mc cain , which was also not very nice for mr vladimir . 
  moscow already offered partitions of ukraine , but no thanks for more of mess in europe . 
  red ru\u015b us full of our history becayse it was integral part of poland for about five hundret years . 
  warmia for quite a bit less and masuria was populated by masurians , polish speaking medieval settlers from masovia . 
  both lands are that part of prussia which was transferred to poland and it 's half empty land of woods and lakes . 
  sure already , do n't take the gossips and sensationalist speculations seriously . 
  depends on your point of view . 
  i know , they fired producers which ignored the schedule . 
  there was no `` ban '' on opposition protest , but the idea was to show also other news and not just a one event . 
  it 's typical , all the medias concentrate on things in line with their agenda and downplay or ignore the opposite . 
   rumor sounds serious . 
   since last few months since always . 
  some people which were leaders of opposition parties . 
  protestors were mostly just common people , not party member and it looks like opposition negotiated this point in favour of demonstrators , which would be just restricted by regular law after the term of this `` amnesty '' comes to an end . 
  it was about association agreement with eu and general strategic direction of future ukrainian politics , if it 's going to unite with russia or rather with eu ( some day ) . 
  it was quite obvious who would take which side , but still this was about foreign relations of ukraine and its sovereign decission , of course with mutual agreement of both sides . 
  you 're talking about some simbolic gestures which are quite meaningles . 
  and usually they 're doing too many , too irrelevant things . 
  sorry , it seems i confused you with some other guy in this thread . 
  anyway your 're arguing that there 's something bad about criticising putin ( not insulting ) , which is quite silly just like ignoring the pro russian policies of obama . 
  it 's very relevant , not just because of your claim that a `` top official '' said it , while she was obviously not official anymore . 
  that 's no excuse , it 's just not important when someone like that says it , unless she takes some important office again , not to mention presidency . 
  that was silly , but there 's going to be a nato summit in warsaw and world 's youth days in krak\u00f3w this year , border controls will be restored for that time . 
  both events can attract terrorists , no matter if poland is `` relevant '' enough to be attacked , services have to be on alert and i doubt if they can be effective ... 
  there was a case of a `` polish '' jihadist , actually born in germany , half polish , half palestinian so called abu bakr al sham . 
  he was few times expelled from germany and driven to the border with poland , where he was picked up by secret services , asked few questions and set free . 
  that guy fought for isis , then returned to poland and then again went to syria , nobody stopped him . 
  just in october 2015 he was captured in jordan . 
  i 've noticed that you 're an american supporter of trump and apologist of putin and i 've said that you wasn ' y hiding that . 
  i agree , except that she was ** not ** a top diplomat then and if you really wants to know , i do n't like her either , but for quite different reasons which i 've mentioned before . 
  i see that greece is recovering from crisis and secured its borders so now there 's time to solve serious issues ... 
  thanks , fortunatelly you was n't hiding anything from the beginning and i guess that 's why you ignored serious issues just to concentrate on some bullshit trash talk of hillary . 
  that comment was made by a ** former ** secretary of state in reaction to invasion of ukraine , so what kind of a `` reset '' would you want to have in this kind of a situation ? 
  and if i 'm not ? 
  that 's again , none of your business and nobody buys your cynical and fake interest in that genocide especially if your wicked country commited far worse . 
  yes , i know that finnland was quite a bit affected . 
  which of the sanctions should be lifted according to you and why ? 
  the reaction of europe for invasion of ukraine was still quite soft and there was n't any for years of selective embargos , provocative maneovres , threats and monopolist malpractice of gazprom or corruption of german chancellor . 
  cancelling abm shield , agreement on reduction of nuclear weapons or cancelling sanctions against russian arms export agenty is hardly a `` joke '' . 
  no idea why you deny it , administration of obama was for most of the time appeasing russia , the same as most of europe was , what 's happening at now is just a sudden reaction to invasion of ukraine . 
  you should understand it , unless you thinks that just russia be ignored and appease no matter what it does . 
  big deal . 
  i 've heard worse comments from politicians . 
  i 'm happy that 's a little fraction of the whole society with no parliamentar representation . 
  it 's not like a whole country praising and following the foorsteps of insane georgian massmurderer . 
  ... and a person which made a `` reset '' with russia , scrapped long range abm programme and ignored europe in general . 
   personal attacks on putin source ? 
  no idea if that 's 20 % , but the negative trend is since 2013 so before any sanctions and food embargo . 
  russian economy was doing poorly since a [ longer time ] ( https://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rus&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  the sanctions are mostly on military hardware and technology . 
  i 'm quite sure that bullying and isolating hungary is not going to make them change relations to russia , not to mention the lack of political will to change the monopolist position of gazprom in this area and dependence on russia which also makes slovakia and czech rep. to oppose sanctions and nord stream ... 
  except that he is n't . 
  remind me when poland invaded ukraine . 
  of course it was , but that was the policy of obama and hilary towards russia . 
  i do n't care about gossips . 
  and how 's internal politics of ukraine a russian business ? 
  i do n't see how 's that comparation of expulsion from one part and the other , or maybe i just do n't get it . 
  anyway that 's some isolated opinion and i thought that you 're talking about some politicians , publicists or other `` serious '' people . 
  netherlands was lucky to be liberated for real , while here the occupation ended in 1993 actually . 
  anyway there was a revanchist sentiment and just hatred , soviets also promoted fear and exploited anti german sentiments . 
  today , i think this is another thing that rapidly improoved over the past 25 years . 
  i do n't see if enybody 's doing that , expulsion is always wrong , no matter the place or the nationality of victims . 
  are you surprised ? 
  you seems to forget the fact that it was not just some greedy annexation , but a compensation for what was taken on the east and in quite a hostile way already in 1939 . 
  then around 1.7 millions poles were just driven out to the work camps in sibiria and central asia , pleanty murdered and even more after german invasion of the soviets and actions of ukrainian chavinists . 
  after six years of insane , brutal occupation , absolutelly different than in netherlands , nobody cared about germans . 
  i 'm not excusing anything , but you should n't be surprised why people hated them and i 'm quite sure that there were some massacres ... even if i do n't know about a single one which was documented . 
  and ukrainians or belarussians took posession of poles , or anybody who was transferred back or forth by the soviet government like crimean tatars , chechens and many , many more ... communists were erasing , or transforming local cultures everywhwere , sometimes leveling whole cities for no military reason , like gda\u0144sk . 
  wroc\u0142aw was a `` festung '' , a one of the last pockets of german resistance , it was mostly destroyed in combat . 
  i could go on , but the point is that it was all destroyed by the red army and rebuilt almost exactly as it was before , the same as warsaw which was razed to the ground and had barely 1000 inhibitants when soviets `` liberated '' it . 
  the people accept that it was wrong , but if you wants official apology then you should ask russia . 
  actually it is true , google it . 
   our exports with russia fell by more than 20 % source ? 
  no idea about italian economy or trade , but it 's just ridiculous to say that food embargo affects footwear factories . 
  russian economy was doing poorly even before invasion of ukraine and crash of oil prices . 
   polish state will recognize it as such and why would the polish state recognise crimes commited by another state ? 
  stop whineing , millions of poles were also expelled from ukraine and belarus or the areas annexed by germany , millions were murdered . 
  nobody cares , nobody knows , russia will never recognise that and in ukraine there 's still a culth of their nazi massmurderers , but people knows about it just because it serves someone 's propaganda ... you thinks that only your and your friend 's families were victims of that war ? 
   it is seen as right and just for poland to take these lands even if it was done through theft and ethnic cleaning and subsequent demoliton of german culture nobody sees it as anything `` right '' , some people just justyfie it or excuse and feels that these accusations are unfair because the whole border changes and population transfers were just forced on everybody . 
  because that was not the reason . 
  russians wanted to compensate the areas of eastern poland that they 've annexed and also transferred millions of people just to prevent etchnic conflicts . 
  according to their propaganda , they were reversing the situation 1000 years back . 
   good sense to exile opposition you must be kidding . 
  russian embargo is just on food , the other trade goes as usually . 
  whatever damaged these factiories it was not the food embargo . 
  so what 's wrong about `` interfering '' with russia ? 
  no , i do n't think that current american foreign policy is in any way related to cold war , in opposite to russian which is basicly all about restoring influence in post soviet area . 
  they 're not a global player anymore and their importance is fading away while china and india is on the rise , which is also adressed by american foreign policy . 
  who says anything about military interventions ? 
  i do n't feel triggered by trump , you should get used to european leftist mass medias and read between the lines of their agenda . 
  there 's a one , but not quite like the other . 
  no idea if they tried , all they could do was talking and still i see it as a kind of amnesty rather than conditions for oposition to fulfill . 
  he actually did not reverted the constitution and this was a serious violation of agreement . 
  the snipers were before , government was appointed by president and approoved by parliament majority ( about 2/3 to be precise ) ... too many confusion and gaps in your memory , no offence . 
  no , it was n't lost , we 're talking about foreign influence on ukraine , or rather about that there was little if any , except for military intervention . 
  hard to say , but kremlin could be surprised by the strong reaction the same as everybody was shocked with their actions . 
  relationships were until then a one way road actually , with neighbours of russia in the middle , but apparently this was a one step too far .
