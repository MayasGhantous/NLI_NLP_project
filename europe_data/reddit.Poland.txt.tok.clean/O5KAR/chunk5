  both parties are playing their games , but it should stay inside the country ... as for the referendum , aside of my personal criticism , at least people collected millions of subscriptions to make it , while the former president organised his own over a night , after he lost the first round and just for cynical reasons , to get the votes of kukiz . 
  anyway , senate approved the referendum of komorowski and it 's going to dismiss the one of duda ( and the millions of people ) , so you should n't be worried , the ruling party should . 
  no , importers are loosing , exporters ... quite the opposite way . 
  also it 's affecting the foreign debt interest rates . 
  what really matters is the purchasing parity . 
  i like the way the trees grew up , 
  it 's good that they learn . 
  every currency in the region is loosing , it 's not becouse of the pictures on coins and banknotes ... 
  i doubt that 's becouse of him , but sure president is the main commander of armed forces so at least he had to agree . 
  anyway , i just realeised that it 's such a short time since he 's in the office , but the level of butthurt in lefty rags makes you feel like he just destroyed the whole world and eveybody hates him . 
  so how did hungary `` ended up '' ? 
  also i do n't remember fidesz advocating $ and people electing them for this reason . 
  lithuania is a little country and it had its currency pegged to $ since a long time , adoption of it was just a simbolic move with no importance . 
  except that gdp rised as well . 
  i do n't think we should follow the eu example in case of public debt , especially if we 're far poorer and after what happend in greece , i 'm not even sure if that data is reliable . 
  anyway , that 's about how `` great '' was the policy of these `` liberals '' ... as for the retirement `` reforms '' , both of them were made actually by the same party and in meantime the common poles paid for incompetence ( if not something worse ) of these politicians . 
  the legend about how wise and responsible are these `` liberals '' is just a primitive propaganda . 
  all the jews who were persecuted and expelled from nearly every european country were quite `` desperate '' . 
  in poland they were welcomed and enjoyed wide [ privillages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_kalisz ) . 
  it can be monitored by the ministry of finances . 
  we have plenty of offices which doubles their competences or just wastes the public money for some party members and families of politicians which are hired there . 
  anyway , i 'm afraid the new gov will do nothing about it and just continue what the coalition of `` liberals '' and `` farmers '' does , but at least this time they 'll be criticised by the `` objective '' massmedias . 
  first of all , they also reduced the disability pensions contribution , income tax ( 19 % to 18 % not just for the `` richest '' ) , cut the inheritance tax , child support tax and many more which affected just common people , not just the `` richest '' ones . 
  anyway i agree if it goes for crisis , but some argue also that the ... liberal economic policy of pis prevented recession . 
  as for the public finances , you obviously ignored the debt , which was always rising , but never as fast as it was under po and it did n't help to `` invest '' the money they 've taklen from the retirement funds . 
  the whole retirement system was `` reformed '' by the same politicians just to be `` reformed '' again now and the people who were forced to pay for these private funds just to be robbed of their savings . 
  `` when the pis was last in power , it had a difficult relationship with polish business circles and was criticized by the opposition for its often controversial policies toward the eu . '', 
  like which ? 
  they reduced taxes and stabilised public finances , the `` liberals '' rised them and borrowed more money than all the other govs put together for 20 years . 
  forbes called them `` communists '' after they took money from the private retirement funds . 
  such `` liberals '' they are . 
  and why could n't it be created when the prospect of $ adoption would be realistic ? 
  we have far too many useless and expensive offices , closing a one of them would be a good start . 
  btw . 
  the adoption of $ is not a major issue in the campaign , actually i do n't know what is . 
  the campaign of both parties is embarassing and primitive ... 
  the `` liberal '' one do n't have a program yet and promised to create it until september , after eight years in power . 
  same in russia , but i guess it 's related to the climate and the types of [ forests ] ( http://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/media/cms_page_media/39/fortyphs%5b1%5d.png ) , not the mountains . 
  cheer up , you have quite alot of bears , 
  they 're actually quite [ popular ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moose#/media/file:moose_distribution.png ) here and sometimes they 're getting lost in warsaw , but i do n't remember a one that went so far downtown . 
  that 's impressive . 
  i know very well that moose can swim , but center of the city is not a good enviroment for such a big animal . 
  i agree , but the lack of trash cans is not helping . 
  the eastern shore is completly wild and actually secured by the `` natura 2000 '' program , the western is `` civilised '' and just this year the old boulevards were replaced by the new ones . 
  also it 's not just about littering , there were discovered hundrets of old tiers . 
  i love the way that vistula and warsaw are green and full of wild animals . 
  today there was a [ moose ] ( http://tvnwarszawa.tvn24.pl/informacje,news,parking-park-az-w-koncu-wisla-podroze-losia-po-warszawie,176958.html ) trying to cross the river in the center , 
  except for these and few other discoveries , there were tons of garbage . 
  warsaw is really a clean city , but it 's becouse of the cleaning services ... 
  i do n't get why people are littering and throwing trash into the river or forests . 
  it 's improoving and never was as bad as it 's in parts of italy , but still it 's a shame . 
  i do n't think so , but it 's not so popular . 
  actually i was never drinking sobieski , i 'm drinking vodka only on some special ocassions . 
  yes , but these are usually more expensive . 
  the list is lacking several brands of female cosmetics , especially inglot , which has about 400 shops in 50 countries . 
  it 's a leader in markets of ireland , malaysia and azerbaijan . 
  watch out for \u017bubr\u00f3wka and krupnik , russian standard bought their factory . 
  from what i 've heard chopin vodka is considered the best , but it 's quite expensive . 
  they bought out polmos bia\u0142ystok and took over production of \u017bubr\u00f3wka and krupnik :( they introduced cheap , `` clean '' versions of these and it 's even hard to get the traditional ones . 
  these two were the only vodkas i was actually drinking on some ocassions . 
  i 've had no idea they 're actually producing anything except of lada and vodka . 
  polish cosmetics are pretty cheap too , they 're getting quite popular in europe . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.polishcosmetics.pl/en/index.php/cosmetics-producers ) you can see some brands . 
  even nivea used to be polish , but it was sold to germans . 
   what about tusk 's idea the same as with the other ideas . 
  mostly complaining about the market economy and american foreign policy . 
  the funniest part was when he criticised europe for promoting `` abortion '' while it 's legal in russia and they 're `` aborting '' far more people than the whole eu put together . 
  anyway that 's some worthles russian copypasta , internet is full of this spam . 
  also , [ nazi `` ghost train '' loaded with gold may have been found in poland ] ( http://www.history.com/news/nazi-ghost-train-loaded-with-gold-may-have-been-found-in-poland ) . 
  read the edit instead of downvoting . 
  i would n't mind him not using english in public speeches , but on private meetings it will be helpful . 
  just for laughts . 
  btw . 
  why the [ downvotes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8z236-crag ) ? 
  it was [ a bit loud ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wideo/z-anteny/premier-na-spotkaniu-z-polakami-w-wilenskim-kosciele-pw-sw-teresy-tvn24,294496.html?playlist_id=18877 ) at some point of time . 
  so , what was promised by donald again ? 
  it 's quite too early to judge it . 
  edit : someone posted [ this short piece ] ( http://europarltv.europa.eu/pl/player.aspx?pid=948e9756-636f-4af6-ba86-a33e00ca52f8 ) . 
  so he does speak english . 
  no idea why he was n't in estonia , i can only guess he had the speech prepared just in polish . 
  that 's how it was . 
  i 'm talking about the consequences of the bolshevik coup since you belive that the situation of farmes improoved , just like you belive in every declaration of lenin . 
  that 's a bunch of excuses based on your naive beliefs and paranoid hatred towards the `` capitalists '' . 
  the situation in mentioned countries is unrelated , they 're not comparable to the tzarist russia , nor to the red one . 
  just becouse he said nothing in public , yet ? 
  do n't know how he was talking with jeb bush or jens stoltenberg , but i 've seen no traslators around . 
  you call this rant an `` explanation '' ? 
  and how 's that even related to russia ? 
   to ensure fairness and equality i 'd laught my ass off if not for the milions of people who died just for the others to be enslaved and exploit . 
  you really are a sick beliver , or just a troll . 
  sure , becouse the farmers are the richest people around . 
  i mean the ones which were working and starving in the slavery of the communist regime . 
  are you really that brainwashed to ignore the results of the so called nationalisation and collectivisation ? 
  i 'm caling elections the will of the people , not the lenin 's coup . 
  no , you did n't . 
  yes , the `` elites '' of farmers who did n't wanted to give their crops to the bolshevik regime and starve to death . 
  but they were the ones who exploit the others , right ? 
  if the point was massmurders , i 'm still talking about it . 
  forgive me if i do n't buy the communist excuses . 
  the goverment of kerensky which won the elections ?
