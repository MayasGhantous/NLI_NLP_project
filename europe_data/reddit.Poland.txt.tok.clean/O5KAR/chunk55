  ( art . 
  197 ) in this case it looks like tribunal refused to proceed in accordiance to the bill . 
  i understand why and as i 've said this was the intention of parliament , this or including a one of judges in question . 
  tribunal is judging the bills , but until then the law is presumed to be constitutional . 
  how 's that retoroactive if the bill is already a law ? 
  the problem here is that 's a bill about tribunal itself , this is the contradiction written in the constitution . 
  another problem is election of judges , because as we can see president is not obliged to take wovs , or at least was n't before the ruling of tribunal , but it was after the new judges were sweaed in . 
  instead of getting emotional , poiting fingers and throwing groundles and powerles threats ( i guess you know how ts works ) you should try to understand that this whole mess happend because it was possible to appoint 2 extra judges in previous cadention and 3 additional in this one . 
  the problem here is also with the way that judges are elected , which can be also regulated by parliamentar bills and voted down by a regular majority . 
  edit : downvote for not enough radical criticism ... how typical for polish redditors . 
  fantastic martyrology of `` far left '' ( following your classification ) created in defence of `` elites '' , which are the real target of this `` saying '' . 
  saying which is equally arrogant and stupid . 
   pis and po together voted by both , but proposed just by a one of two . 
  i agree it 's a power grab , but it 's possible just because the constitution allows this and both parties took advantege of it , one before and the other after elections . 
  this is a bit more complicated and pointing fingers is not going to help . 
  the real issue is with constitution , which allows this kind of conflicts because in this case the problem is with a bill about tribunal . 
  constitution says that tribunal is composed of 15 judges , elected by parliament for 9 years cadentions , details are regulated by a bill and before it 's judged , there 's presumption of legality so in theory tribunal should judge it in accordiance to existing rules . 
  it did n't and gov argues that this sentence is not legal because of that . 
  i suppose that was the whole idea of ruling party from the beginning , they issued a rule in their bill that tribunal needs to proceed with 13 judges , if it would happend , then at least a one of three `` controvercial '' judges should be included . 
  if parliament would want to avoid this conflict , then they could issue * vacatio legis * long enough to judge it , but they did n't which is also legal , but problematic in this paerticular case . 
  this is another problem which was not predicted by the creators of constitution . 
  there 's already conflict of competences between president and government , now we have a conflict between parliament and constitutional tribunal . 
  no idea what legislators were thinking then , that a single party will hold all of these institutions forever ? 
  ok , i thought you 're talking about embriogenesis . 
  birth is indeed a major stress for both organisms and can be lethal , but this is also what medicine is for . 
   since there is no unequivocal definition of life , the current understanding is descriptive . 
  life is considered a characteristic of something that exhibits all or most of the following traits : - homeostasis : cells of zygote keeps it , as well as sperm , but ** only ** for limited time . 
  - organisation : obviously both are organised , even if sperm lacks cell organelles . 
  - metabolism : sperm does ** not ** anabolise any of its components , it does n't absorb organis matter , once it 's created , it 's ** only ** katabolising stored energy to perform its only function . 
  - growth : sperm does ** not ** grow . 
  - adaptation : sprem ca n't adapt , an organism can only to some extent and thus there 's natural selection . 
  - response to stimuli : both can respond to chemical and phisical stimulation . 
  - reproduction : sperm ca n't reproduce , a healthy meture organism can and humans are maturing in puberty . 
  how about we abort pregnant women ? 
  it would be also a `` birth control '' ... 
   you consider them separate entities not me . 
  no idea what kind of `` damage '' you 're talking about , it 's a natural proces and it does n't matter if you like it or not , this is just how we reproduce . 
  this kind of comparations are ususally useless , the parents are `` donors '' of their gametes . 
   list the characteristics i 've asked you to read the definition of life , you should have it in biology classes anyway , or at least i hope that 's in american schools curriculum . 
  [ read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life#biology ) . 
   unless we choose to allow it to you 're obviously wrong , we can control it only as far as contraception works . 
  mothers ( and fathers ) should be awared of that when they decides what to do with their `` bodies '' . 
  once again i repeat , humans in embrional period of their life are separate organisms ( bodies ) , even if dependant on their mothers . 
  excuse me if i think that someones comfort is not enough to justyfie elimination of another human . 
  i 'm afraid it is , not a single biologist , not even a phisician which somehow excuses aborting humans , would consider gametes as living organisms and deny that zygote is a one . 
  deliberatelly i 've mentioned sometic cells , also because they 're diploids . 
  so i tell you once again that arguing with independence or viability outside of mothers womb is a fallacy . 
  there were developed ways to treat premature births and humans are dependant on mothers for many years even after they mature during puberty . 
  also , once again i repeat that intercourse leads to procreation and if it 's not a rape , then the argument about `` unwanted '' offspring is moot . 
  so we have a conflict of interests here and unless we get a compromise and develop some technology to avoid this problem , we have no other choice to preserve the life of both parts . 
  no , gametes are not living organism , neither somatic cells are . 
  please , read the definition of life . 
  and i see it clearly because zygote in her own `` body '' is a separate human . 
  excuse me if i think that every human is a subject , not an object . 
  no , i 'm telling once again that an offspring organism is not their own organism ( `` body '' , if you insist ) and that the humans which are dependent on the others are not their `` property '' . 
  i was n't referring to your comments , but to the general rules . 
  zygote is an early stage of organism developement , if it 's a human zygote , then it 's a human organism , it fulfills all the biologic criteria of a living organism . 
  what you 're trying to talk about are the conditions set by some politicians and ideologues in order to excuse elimination of that human organism . 
  fetus ( organism in prenatal stage of developement ) would n't survive in many cases of premature or complicated birth without medical assistance . 
  usually the `` human '' rights applies to registred specimens and this happends with birth , but this is again , humans legislation and depends on regime , laws of nature and phisical sciences are something else and sometimes unfortunatelly contradicting . 
  they have , except that they should n't have absolute authority over the other humans . 
  we can only to some degree , contraception and sterilisation is not working every time . 
  eliminating sick and `` unwanted '' humans is not a medical solution , even hipocrates was against it , but who cares about it today . 
  i 'm all in favour of contraceptives and education . 
  morning after pills are basicly the same what aborting humans is , except that it 's even more harmful also to the mother . 
  eliminating humans is someyhing i 'm opposing , as you probably know . 
  a young mammal is dependent on mother , sometimes for many years even after birth . 
  independence does not determinate a human . 
  good , but until then we have nothing else but human wombs . 
  we can not control most of processes that are taking place in our own bodies , another person like phisician can do it , but still is limited . 
  no , it [ does n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life#biology ) , unless you mean growth , which is also why i 'm mentioning the first mitotic divisions of zygote . 
  what you consider a `` safe side '' is highly subjective and this is also why i 'm against definitions of human based on ideology , or religion ( if there is any ) . 
  [ read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consciousness ) . 
  a human is a living human organism , just that . 
  of course , parents which are unable or unwilling to rise their children can give their babies away . 
  yes , but sex can lead to fertilisation , no matter your intentions or awarness . 
  and i see why humans matters for other humans just like it is amongst the other social species . 
  another false comparation , organ is not organism . 
  absolutelly , kids should be protected if their parents are dangerous , but we ca n't force sterilisation . 
  as i 've said , it has other functions , but procreation is the primary . 
  the whole evolution is about survival of the fittest species and this strategy just worked for our specie . 
  a potato is not a human ... 
  of course . 
  the question is not if we should protect humans and prevent others from taking their lives away , i hope we agree at lest on that , the question is what 's a human . 
  there 're few answers , but i 'm considering biological as the most neutral and objective . 
  of course it can , but why do you assume that consciousness determinates human ? 
  a potato is not conscious , but a pig definitely is . 
  we 're all `` clumps of cells '' . 
  the limits you 're talking about are just legislative creations based on some ideological beliefs , they can be changed in this or the other way . 
  just because something 's legal it does n't mean that 's fair and ca n't be criticised , there 're far too many examples of bad or even inhumane laws all around the world . 
  and because of all of that we should narrow the margin of dubious definitions and ideologic concepts down to the natural , objective sciences . 
  it does n't depend on me , but in many countries there 're services which takes care of abused childern in patologic families . 
  ok , so there 's also this social function , which does n't change the primary , biological one . 
  it 's a living organism since feritilisation , or more exactly since the first mitotic divisions , whatever you consider `` sufficient '' development and thus grant the human `` rights '' to this organism , does n't change the fact that it 's a living human organism . 
  so why do n't we concentrate on developing life saving technologies instead of removing the `` problematic '' humans ? 
  i 'm afraid it does . 
  it 's not my idea or invention so do n't blame me , but the fact is that people reproduce and grow in female bodies , you ca n't control or `` dominate '' some natural processes that happends inside your body . 
  once again , goverment is not forcing people to reproduce . 
  pregnancy is a natural process thanks to which we 're all here , patologic exceptions should be treated separatelly by medicine . 
  yes and this is also why i would consider rape as an exception , but still adviced against it .
