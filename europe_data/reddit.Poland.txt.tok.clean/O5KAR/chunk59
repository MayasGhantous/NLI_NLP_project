  timothy snyder is really an interesting speaker and has quite a bit of knowledge about this whole region , but the rules of propaganda are really old . 
   if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it , people will eventually come to believe it . 
  joseph goebbels, 
  yeah , i see there 's no point talking with russians ... do svidania, 
  threats are a part of kremlin diplomacy , hard to take them seriously when they 're directed against nato and / or eu members like sweden , finnland or poland , but apparently in case of ukraine they had nothing to loose . 
  georgia was a different case because there was ongoing conflict with separatist regions , not created from a scratch like in donbass . 
  i was surprised also because this invasion means that they just gave up ukraine , now they can just take naval bases in crimea , make a mess in donbass to prevent nato membership , but ukraine as a country is lost for them . 
   who killed people in odessa ? 
  a lynch mob , first russians killed few ukrainians , then ukrainians killed few more russians ... lets be objective , right ? 
   whose artilery devastated donetsk and lugansk ? 
  both of them according to oecd because of using multiple rocket launchers of unguided missiles such a grad and smersh . 
  moscow basicly organised this junta in donbas led by borodai and girkin , `` volunteers '' from the city of moscow . 
   empire is simply that above a kingdom . 
  the emperor is the sovereign above kings that 's a funny concept , but what if a parliament is above king and nobility is the soverign that elects deputies and monarchs ? 
   unwritten promises chit chats in another words . 
   1610 are you for real ? 
  that was over 400 years ago and no , the republic was not an empire . 
   russian aggression against ukraine was more predictable was it really ? 
  ask yourself , was you surprised when it happened ? 
  i was and especially if i remember how the high hopes of `` orange revolution '' crushed with reality and ended up with yanukovych in charge . 
  they could wait this time as well , in few years it could end up the same as before , but someone got impatient ... 
  actually [ ukraine was richer than poland in 1991 ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gdp_production_current_us&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=541810800000&amp;tend=1393887600000&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg&amp;iconsize=0.5 ) . 
  then something really bad happened to it and apparently the shock therapy worked for poland . 
   unlikely [ it 's official ] ( http://www.money.pl/gospodarka/unia-europejska/wiadomosci/artykul/polska-bedzie-platnikiem-netto-w-ue-w-2016-r,220,0,1976796.html ) but because of technicalities and just this year . 
  no idea who do you consider `` eurosceptic '' , but the anti eu parties in poland are minimal . 
  well said . 
  not just nato , any kind of a millitary alliance would n't want to include members with ongoing territorial disputes , unless it really wants to be a side in it . 
  yeah , keep importing middle eastern `` workers '' , we prefere our neighbours . 
  said like a true hero ... russian interests are all over europe , imagine that some of them are against ours , but i guess it depends what you consider as such , if you consider that at all . 
  guns , bombs , prostitutes ... 
  calm down , i have other things to do besides talking with russian apologists . 
  lets see . 
  nazarbayev - old commie , rules kazakhstan since it was still ssr , karimov - same story except that in uzbekistan , rahmon - another sucessor of ussr , crushed opposition in a bloody civil war , with help of russia of course , survived assasination attempts and coups . 
  turkmenistan is a bit different because the old comunist fart died and power was passed to his sucessor by the party . 
  elections in these countries are joke , the appointed candidates gets about 90 % support , if there 're any counter candidates at all . 
  their foreign relations concentrate almost entirely on russia , all of them are members of cis and the new eurasian union , besides other similar organisations . 
  moldova is the poorest country of europe , after brief war , of course with russian participation , it 's isolated and influenced by russian military separatist region transnistria , the russian minority and soviet style politicians are highly influential . 
  belarus is a museum of communism , allied and in a way united with russia , heavily dependant on preferrential prices for gas and oil from moscow , quaite a bit like ukraine until recently . 
  armenia is traditinally pro russian , also ruled by a post communist president and the same member of russian led international organisations , also hosts their military bases . 
  there 're millions of slavs already in western europe , at least two millions in germany . 
  poles are also the biggest minorities in britain , ireland , norway and iceland . 
  eh ... look at the rulers of central asia , all of them were leaders of ssrs and they 're in power since then . 
  belarus is associated with moscow and it 's their only military allie , completly dependant on cheap gas and oil . 
  sorry , but you 're again talking bullshit in favour of russia , they 're extremaly influential on most of these countries , but they 're loosing this power constantly . 
   millions of slavs , 
  w\u00f3dka 2 . 
  cigarettes 3 . 
  disco polo, 
  fags are still quite cheap in poland . 
   way to smuggle it this makes me wonder ... what else could be smuggled because of uncontrolled and tolerated illegal border crossings ? 
  by moderate left medias or these few conservative that barely exists and probably just in america or britain . 
  i know , but is it just geography ? 
  look at the baltic states . 
  they , in opposite to poland , were part of ussr and now they 're members of nato and eu even if estonia or latvia are much closer to petetsburg and moscow than ukraine is . 
  poland is bordering kaliningrad , also belarus is allied and in a way united with russia . 
  i disagree that 's just geography and i 've never said that the reforms were nothing because it was really a painful process in the 90s . 
  regardless of reasons ukraine was in a limbo , still tied up with kremlin by economy , cis and military bases in crimea . 
  with etchnic minority , soviet and internationalist nostalgia , but it was not as close as belarus . 
  there were two sides , one trying to get closer and rebuilt more direct realtions with the `` east '' and the other trying to go `` west '' . 
  before maidan and yanukovych there was the `` orange revolution '' and also because of that i was shocked by the reaction of kremlin for this change of power . 
  just your `` elite '' was divided between those two concepts while we cut off the ties with moscow ( but unfortunatelly not with the far left regime ) and our politicians had a clear direction , there was a consesnsus on the strategic goals in foreign politics . 
  excuse me , but poland has limited abilities and no matter if we 'd like to , the `` big boys '' do n't let us sit at the adult table in minsk . 
  poland offered several billions $ credits and both gov and the people organised quite a lot of humanitarian aid for the conflict zones . 
  there 's visa free border movement and quite easy access to work visas or even the `` card of a pole '' , you just need to know basic language . 
  again the whole political `` elite '' agree on this issue , no matter how divided in domestic and details of foreign politics , every single party has a clear position towards kiev and moscow . 
  it is , but only to some point of identification . 
  if you follow that outdated classifucation just for the sake of belonging to the `` better '' part , the one with better propaganda , then it 's tribalism indeed . 
  today there 're no pure doctrines , not a single party follows them to the point of encyclopedic definition and mass medias does a lot to put labels , usually a stigma and for some reason it 's almost always `` right wing '' . 
  you do n't see often `` left wing '' or `` internationalist '' or whatever adjective next to the politicians and parties because that 's the one and only `` normal '' tribe , the other has to be extra oridinary and thus just a temporal `` mistake '' of history . 
   pis in poland , emerged from the nationalist right no , it did n't . 
  they 're actually quite socialists , closely cooperating with trade union `` solidarno\u015b\u0107 '' and many top party members used to be active in opposition to the far left regime . 
  they 're also conservative and besides of anti comunist opposition they 're referring to the memory of anti german resistance and some kind of nostalgia for pre war poland , which was also ruled by socialists like pi\u0142sudski . 
  the nationalists movement ( national democratic ) died out , today it 's just a bunch of football hooligans with something like three deputies , elected by mistake on a back of kukiz . 
  ok , lets assume these are just facts , but the question is what are you going to do about it because pointing fingers and complaining is too easy . 
  next year poland will be net contributor , just by technical delays and just for a year , but anyway it 's not that simple to say that eu funds are the only reason for improovements , it 's not even the main reason . 
  poland is the least corrupted state of eastern eu , but it 's also less corrupted than spain and especially italy , the old union members . 
  there 're requirements which we had to fulfill before joining and it took many years and cooperation of several governments , including post communist which signed the accesion treaty and post communist president which ratified it . 
   ukraine has been getting torn apart by the east and west all throughout it 's history  slavs are just one step above arabs in the eyes of the west like i 'd hear a typical polish martyrology . 
  stop making excuses and blaming others , they 'll exploit your weakness no matter who you are , just start working and be patient ... oh and create some serious opposition to this `` elite '' in rada , but please , not neo nazi . 
  so what happened after that murder ? 
  was there any reaction , revision of the language , moderation of comments , whatever ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not defending offensive language and i never use it , but the only difference between comments on gw for example and youtube is a target , an `` enemy '' . 
   poland is n't wild west [ you have no idea ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/number-of-guns-per-capita-new.jpg ), 
   controversial and biased leftist propagandists yes and they are , but still they 're reporting in most of cases about facts , just with thier own spin . 
   i do n't know why they 're doing this ... organized money . 
  fearmongering and sensationalist , so called `` tabloid '' informations are clickbaits . 
  and this works both ways , i mean all sides and medias does it , some choose `` nazism '' as a boogeyman , others takes `` muslims '' . 
  you 're doing the same actually . 
  ther 're [ very few ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/number-of-guns-per-capita-new.jpg ) guns in private hands in poland and the problem with max kolonko is not that he 's just another one supporting liberalisation of gun control , but that he 's manipulating and fearmongering in a cynical way to attract the viewers . 
  no idea about wideoprezentacje , this guy is annoying . 
  do you feel concerned that hysteria and venom in medias already claimed a life of marek rosiak few years ago ? 
   kukli this reminds me another fun show from 90s polish tv , but with animal dolls and rhymed dialogs . 
  it was called [ `` polskie zoo '' ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xcsosk3lt9i/hqdefault.jpg ) . 
  now you 're just making some wild theories . 
  do you think it 's hard to manipulate other people ? 
  much higher than in wwii apparently ... 
  jokes aside , i just do n't see how this `` workers '' argument applies if they could import much closer and actually citizens of eu to do it . 
  not to mention that it could be much easier and cheaper to educate , employ and integrate them . 
  i just do n't see any rational thinking here , it seems to be purely ideologic and emotional `` politics '' . 
  why then germany waited as long as they could before allowing workers from the `` new '' eu member states ?
