  the situation of abkhazia and south ossetia is different because separatism of these people has some historical background while the `` noworisja '' is created from nothing , there was never any separatism or etchnic conflict , it 's just made up like transnistria . 
  this was internal issue of ukraine , the same as scotland is british or catalunya spanish , it ca n't excuse any other country interfering and especially not in military way . 
  russia just invaded and annexed this area , with or without local support , it 's relevant and dangerous precedence . 
  the founding people of europe were schuman , de gasperi and adenauer . 
  i wonder what they could say if they see this mess ... you ca n't have democracy without demos , this is one thing that the internationalists do n't understand . 
  rulers of a `` federalised '' eu would not be representative and alrenated from people , even more than they 're at now . 
  we ca n't all have the same goals because we 're different , countries and people are just different . 
  we can and we have some basic goals which are universal , like we all want peace and prosperity , but we have different needs and different ways to acheive it and we can have also different understanding what ` prosperity ' for example is . 
  expected by whom ? 
  not a single eu member recognised south ossetia and abkhazia , even if official report claimed that georgia attacked separatists and it was ok to invade georgia . 
  the other topic is , as i 've said , security or military and there 's absolutelly nothing else that russia can offer . 
  relations works both ways and i do n't see a reason why france or italy should beg russia to be nice . 
  no problem , sierakowski will not let us forget about him . 
  especially for slave traders . 
  it was not the crown , but nobility which pressured queen to expell them and the converts because that was a rich competition . 
  anyway this does n't proove that exploitation of castrated men and female sex toys in al-andalus was anything better . 
  and a far left or moderate person would never say that for example krytyka polityczna is `` far '' . 
  it all depends . 
  so , now `` really '' we 're going to ignore borders and international agreements because it 's ** easy ** for a strong country to take teritory of a weak one ? 
  then i see russians and their useful idiots whineing about expansion of nato ... 
  / r/polska is a little circlejerk , poland is much bigger . 
  it also depends on perspective , a leftist person would never say that the medial empire of michnik is lefty , but everybody else probably will . 
  depends when and for whom . 
  one of the first people which described poland in xc . 
  ( the land of mesco ) was abraham ben jakob , known also as ibrahim , a jewish slave trader sent by ummayads to bohemia . 
  myslim slavery is often ignored , but that was a full scale industry . 
  that was retarded and not the only `` argument '' like that , but still they both accomplished some compromise with lisbon treaty and measuring votes . 
  even if i think they should n't bend to pressure and sign that treaty i 'm quite sure that donald would sign everything * in blanco * . 
  there were books about merkel published in germany which described her past . 
  never heard about that idea of museum and the one of wwii in gda\u0144sk is under construction . 
  not sure about recognition of borders . 
  as i 've said , he wants to be a strong figure and as every politician creates his image in opposition to the others and negative emotions , but the way he 's demonised by the leftists is the same wrong as he 's praised by the supporters . 
  anyway their policies ( or rhetorics ) are against corporations , banks , quite protectionist and socialist , if you consider that the german companies are very strong here ( for obvious reasons ) then you can imagine why they blame germany that poland is falling behind . 
  you really should n't take all of that seriously , there 's a lot of criticism of germany and merkel all around europe , but again ... the words are cheap , decissions matters . 
   island monkey how nice . 
  i 've never said it was * only * about economy , but this relates to many things , including peace . 
  so you exclude the `` monkey '' , south , east and your `` union '' looks kinda sad , but have it your way if you ca n't have a compromise and ... unity . 
  no idea what 's a `` common way '' , but i smell some utopic engineering behind it . 
  yes , in al-andalus after muslims conquared iberian penisula . 
  when spaniards got rid of it , the ottomans were conquaring byzantine greeks and tatars harrasing eastern europe . 
  all of these countries were full of christian slaves ( saqaliba , mamluks , yanissary ) , men were castrated or brainwashed since infancy to be loyal soldiers , women were sexually exploited in harems . 
  the russian economy is smaller than italian and even more corrupted . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/2012_russia_products_export_treemap.png ) is what they 're exporting . 
  i suppose that some european leaders will be bribed or convinced with some fat gas and oil contracts , so it will happend eventually , but it 's not in our interest to feed this regime and we get nothing for accepting their politics except for encouraging them . 
  it was all this way for the past 26 years , every time we were listening to them and showing good will , they saw it as weakness and exploited without giving anything in return . 
  i was rather talking about your issues with hungarians , which minority is pretty big in slovakia . 
  no , it was not expected and everybody was shocked that russia could invade ukraine , the local gov and people of crimea were asking several times for more autonomy and other concessions , but never were supported by russia which was just interested in naval military bases . 
  there 're areas and even countries in the world that are unrecognised , for example taiwan . 
  i doubt that any of these countries buys as much of their gas and oil as germany or poland . 
  the only other reason which russia could be important for europe is security and they 're a danger for peace so either we continue the failed policy of appeasment or `` explain '' them that it 's not in their interest to continue provocations and wars around here . 
   inhabitated by a russian majority just because they displaced tatars . 
  it 's not about the population , but about territorial integrity and international rules which were violated . 
  do n't make comparations to wwii , i hope that we have it behind us , but the actions of russia ca n't be just ignored . 
  i see no reason why should anybody accept the annexation of a territory of another country and why should we make any concessions towards russia if it 's and was never willing to take a step back . 
  crimea is an issue of ukraine and russia , we should react to this kind of behaviour , but it 's up to them to resolve their common borders . 
  they could start by giving back the spanish and romanian gold reserves . 
  poland had no losses , we 're used to russian embargos and our exports are doing better than ever . 
  we were `` normalising '' relations with russia for the past 26 years and look where we are . 
  i see no reason for recognising annexation of any territory in europe and lifting sanctions against russia , we do n't need them for anything else but gas and oil , they need our money even more . 
  i 'm actually not surprised about some french or italians , why should they care about some distant country which they ca n't even put on a map , but you ? 
  ukraine is a neighbour of slovakia , you have your history and etchnic minorities too . 
  redrawning the borders of europe and annexing parts of the other countries is a dangerous way . 
   third-country nationals residing ** legally ** in member states , and the prevention of , and enhanced measures to combat , ** illegal ** immigration and trafficking in human beings . 
  whatever germany decided to do with illegal migrants after they broke the law does n't work backwards . 
  we all should pay or support defence of schengen borders , combatting human trafficking , illegal border crossings and remove unauthorised residents . 
  tolerating and encouraging criminals should be punishable . 
  same is here and also they do n't have to explain what they 're spending money for , just they ca n't exceed the budget and there 're some restrictions about private donors . 
  it looks to me like a social campaign and i do n't see the name of any party in it , even if it looks unethical since the pm is mentioned . 
  what do you mean by `` national consultation '' ? 
  was fidesz using the public money and institutions for collecting these signatures ? 
  about 1.7 m sounds impressive as for a country of 10m . 
  well , that was temporary also because this wave of immigrants was deflected towards croatia and winter was coming , but most of all these migrants were just crossing on their way to german paradise . 
  it could turn some ugly way and i can only guess that was kinda shocking . 
   campaign proclaiming fidesz really ? 
  i suppose that parties in hungary are getting money for their campaigns and have to declare everything , even if they 're spending it for wine , cigars and go-go clubs like the party of donald did in poland . 
  may i see something about that campaign ? 
  no , this is still quite a bit of money , but local governments has to take huge loans because at least part of the investment has to come from it . 
  so it would take a bit longer to develop infrastructure , but at least we would n't be in debt , or not that much . 
  eu is positive especially because of freedom of trade , movement and work , the funds in theory should reduce the differences between the member states but as we can see nothing comes for free . 
  denemark has no gas , we should have these pipes from norway long time ago and now with schroeder pipe we 'll have troubles to built it or take bigger tankers for lng port because angela and her poodle donald lied that the pipe can be moved deeper . 
  so funny . 
  you really do n't get it , but i do see a difference between germany and russia . 
  yeah , you 've missed the part in which illegall immigrants learns about german hospitality and germany learns that ca n't keep everybody so it has to send them to the other states . 
  do as you wish in your country , but do n't make the others to break schengen rules , smuggle migrants along their territory , then close the borders and dump migrant quotas on everybody else . 
  unless that state is rich and powerfull ... 
  if eu is no more a place to serve common interests of its members then it 's not an union anymore and that 's not what i was voting for in referendum . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/migrations/news/germany-suspends-dublin-agreement-for-syrian-refugees/ ) . 
  disgusting blacmail . 
  do as you wish , we did n't make the rules about european funds before accesion and this is not the reason we joined . 
  with this arrogant attitude you makes people which suports eu ( like me ) to hate it . 
  ca n't remember when ever you did , but in this case hungary was hit the hard way by the crisis and bashed by the irresponsible utopists when tried to control the illegall border crossings . 
  orban is obviously trying to get some points in domestic public , the outcome of such a referendum , if passed , is easy to predict . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i 'm just criticisng the way this treaty was used because qualified vote was not the only option and if the previous polish gov would n't be pretending to oppose and cheated people ( and v4 ) then maybe it would be possible to find blocking minority . 
  many of these treaties were broken already , for example in $ zone . 
  even if that was all in line with letter of the law , germany should be criticised for its approach and suspension of dublin treaty , which resulted in temporal and local suspension of schengen and not only by german gov. 
   competence can be exclusive , joint with national governments , or supporting , with national governments having lead competence . 
  so when we broke any treaty or refused to honor agreements ? 
  i agree that it would tarnish our reputation , we 're not germany to break dublin treaty or suspend schengen and bash the others which wants to enforce these rules . 
  it 's not like somone would make a debate in ep or launch a mechanism to mess into internal german politics just because we do n't like the ruling party .
