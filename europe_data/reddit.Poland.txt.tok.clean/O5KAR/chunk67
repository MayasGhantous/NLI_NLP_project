  i 've seen how they 're showing literally three guys distributing some anti ukrainian flyers in warsaw like that would be something serious ... 
  same way the other medias are working , inflating numbers of protestors that they agree with and ignoring others . 
  americans maybe , the american gov not necessary . 
  poland is the only eu country i know which people have to get visa in order to visit usa and their behaviour in case of cia prisons was just disgusting ... americans tortured their prisoners without even our knowledge and then we had to pay compensations and take the blame because that was obviously against unhrc . 
   that 's basically everyone . 
  well , we did n't just elected communists and warsaw pact was fighting mostly its own members ( like czechoslovakia ) . 
  the other thing is that the same communists ( then called post communists ) decided to join nato and eu , a day or so after bombing of belgrade ( they also sent our troops to iraq and made the secret cia prisons ) , but there was a consensus about the alliance and european union amongst all of the major partiers , several governments worked for many years to join . 
  could you explain what 's that deal with nato about ? 
  eu is something else and i think it would be in serbian interest to join it , but as you say , it 's up to the people . 
  i understand why there 's a special relation between serbia and russia and why there 's a monument for nickolas ii ( i 'm following [ the great war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/thegreatwar/featured ) and learned to respect serbia a lot ) . 
  but ... ca n't understand why people which are obviously against separatism and kosovo independence supports some russian puppet states in ukraine . 
  military alliances are n't usually a matter of referendums , but if parliament , president and thus government comes from elections , it 's also controlled by the people . 
  i see no reason for serbia to join nato and really ca n't understand why montenegro wants to . 
  ok , but there is or was some npd and other nationalists ( if that 's `` far right '' ) . 
  abusing this kind of labels is just confusing and always makes me suspicious if that 's not just an `` insult '' , usually it is and does n't help to understand anything . 
  is alternative for germany really `` far right '' or is it just another `` nagative '' label used for political opponents ? 
  they should , but obviously the way it 's taught in britian and sweden does n't work . 
  i mean that especially stds and other diseases should be taught in biology classes , including the ways to prevent them , also by anticonception . 
  got it , but maybe the lessons were more harm than help , no idea really . 
  besides , it 's not like they 're banned , parents and pupils have a choice at now and personally i do n't see a reason for anything except of biology . 
   sex ed was n't a separate lesson in itself ok , i thought it was . 
  and how is he responsible for that ? 
  no idea what `` progress '' you 're talking about , but stds and teenage pregnancy is a problem since quite a bit of time , same as these sex education classes . 
  it looks to me that the reason is not cameron , but these lessons . 
  i 've heard about it , but it was introduced some time after i 've finished high school . 
  reproduction and sex is just biology and i do n't see a reason why to make some special classes just for that . 
  considering the statistics of teenage pregnacies it seems that britons are ignorant already . 
  no offence . 
  so what 's that sex education for ? 
  or , what 's the difference between it and biology ? 
  it has to be the system , not the people . 
  do n't know such statistics , but you can compare these numbers to the other countries , with or withour sex ed and with different ways to teach it . 
  so it seems that sex ed does n't work because that should be the reason to teach it , preventing spread of stds and teenage pregnancies . 
  i guess if you can abort your kid whenever you wants then nobody cares about the consequences . 
  every girl i used to have sex with was kinda a `` serious '' relationship and most of them were on pills . 
  i would n't even want to touch an `` easy '' girl and i 'm disgusted by prostitutes , but that 's just me . 
   no safe sex and std 's going rife because of that generation [ o'rly ? ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teenage_pregnancy_and_sexual_health_in_the_united_kingdom ), 
  why then britain is leading in numbers of teenage pregancies and swden in some of stds ? 
  it does n't work obviously . 
   lying about what sex is about you mean that it 's about procreation ? 
  i 'm going to be bashed for that , but leftists also lies when they advertise aborting people . 
  same in poland , it is just on biology lessons , or at least it was when i was in high school . 
   fantastic sex education . 
  i wonder , why stds are so widespreaded in countries like britain or sweden . 
  also , britain tops the numbers of teenage pregnancies in europe . 
  should n't sex education prevent this kind of problems ? 
  do n't you have it in biology classes ? 
  no , it was not similar for the reasons i 've alredy wrote about and you just ignored . 
  it 's not blocked , neither denied , there 's just some vague idea to not allow people say that the german camps were polish , which is obviously a lie . 
  you really have no idea . 
  for any kind of help to a jew there was a collective death penatly to the whole family or a village , for a single german that was killed they were catching a hundret of random people and executing on spot . 
  i linked already intelligenzaktion , there was also aktion ab , massacres in pia\u015bnica , palmiry and hundrets of places where germans slaughtered millions of people and just for your information , not only jews were exterminated in the german death camps . 
  aushwitz i was the first camp there and it was just for polish `` criminals '' . 
  now you must be kidding me ... not just collaborators were executed , but also tens of thousands soldiers of the anti german resistance just because they were n't communists . 
  these `` liberators '' put the leaders of secret state and home army on a kangaroo trial in moscow just because they organised uprising in warsaw . 
  are you so ignorant to not know that your `` allies '' had nothing to say about the borders , expulsion of millions of people and politics of post war poland which was just a soviet puppet occupied up until 1993 ? 
  i 've told you , you must be confusing poland with france , there was no german puppet governemnt here , no collaborating administration or any officials , not even any volunteer waffen ss , but just a pack of degenerated people paid to sell the jews and those who hid them , some propagandist actors and few guards in camps . 
  all of them were executed , so i have no idea who do you want to interview . 
  is [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligenzaktion ) a `` propaganda '' ? 
  and note , this is just a one of many examples of german policies . 
  so , the minority of `` superior race '' in poland was collaborating with germany and hated for that . 
  i do n't quite understand where do you see an `` error '' in that , should poles love the ones who mistreated them ? 
   worst of the camp handlers still , do n't get your point . 
  there was collaboration with germany and it was , as you quoted , mostly the german minority because they were considered worthy , in opposite to the polish `` sub humans '' . 
  the worst thing poland did was not collaborating with germany , keeping worthless alliance with france and britain , not giving up and resisting which caused us millions of victims under german occupation . 
  i 'm not , [ read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22polish_death_camp%22_controversy#operations_to_whitewash_german_responsibility_for_wwii ) . 
  the camps built and operated by germany were located in annexed or occupied territories of poland . 
  there were no officials collaborating since germans executed all of them , including teachers , scientists , doctors , sportsmen , politicians , journalists and every active public figure . 
  policemen and railroad engineers were mobilised and forced to work or face execution . 
  according to germans , poles were subhumans used as a slave labour , so no ... it was very much different than in collaborating france . 
  i also do n't think that stupidity or lies should be punished , it would be much better to educate people about the german death camps and all the crimes they 've commited . 
  you mean like it was in germany with former nazi officials making up stories about `` polish death camps '' ? 
  are you implying that the polish politicians collaborated with germans just like the french did ? 
  yeah , except that berry does n't write his own speeches . 
  english is not my mother tongue , but this is a pathetic excuse . 
  how could that camp be `` polish '' then and why would a polish soldier infiltrate it and escape to report about conditions inside ? 
  now these camps ( actually museums and memorials ) are polish because of location and ownership , but not then . 
   there are very good reasons to forbid holocaust denial in germany and there was a very good reason for adenauer to whitewash german criminals and coin the term `` polish death camps '' . 
  i agree that this move would be wrong , if it 's going to be passed , instead of that we should correct what was done by returning the guilt where it belongs , to germany . 
  yeah , with all of these slums and gangs . 
  so how `` ambiguos '' was it when barrack obama awarded jan karski , which according to him escaped from a `` polish camp '' ? 
  there 're more examples of using this phrase in a context of wwii . 
  one of many . 
  do n't get me wrong , i think it 's a bad idea . 
  it would be much better if the polish gov would run a campaign like the german did , but instead of falsifying history and whitewashing criminals we should promote the accurate name ** german death camps ** . 
  that 's funny , because a one of these idiots is an american president . 
  i do n't blame him , but someone wrote this speech for a ceremony of awarding jan karski , a soldier of polish resistance which infiltrated ** german death camps ** and brought a report to the allies , including roosevelt , which ridiculed him . 
   the west german intelligence formed agency 114 ( german : dienststelle 114 ) within the gehlen organization ; headed by alfred benzinger ( a nazi abwehrpolizei ) , who in 1956 launched a coordinated action to move the blame away from the war criminals under various investigations . 
  benzinger adopted the loaded phrase `` polish death camps '' in the mid 1960s in order to suggest , contrarily to the facts , that poles , not germans , were responsible for the mass genocide during world war ii . 
  no , unless you consider these which are shifting blame and whitewashing germany as `` conspiracy theorists '' . 
  not even close to german levels .

  [ 14 ] enough of this . 
  the polish gov should make a similar action with `` german death camps '' , which in contrary to the german operation would be just historical truth . 
  like penalty for holocaust denial ? 
   soviet agents taking the role of the former agitators and that was the case of infamous kielce pogrom after the war . 
   there 's a reason why jews did not want to stay in europe after wwii and there 's a reason why they stayed in poland before , not just because they were kicked out of almost every single european state , but also because they were settled by russians in xixc in the `` pale of settlement '' . 
  unfortunatelly people do n't read about the jewish life in poland , but only about death and under german occupation .
