  appeasment and pacifism did n't worked well . 
  i do n't find french , italian or spanish people too distant or `` foreign '' ( well , they 're foreigners to me ) , but i guess it does n't work both ways or at least not for everybody . 
  anyway , there 's a military alliance called nato and even if [ public opinion ] ( http://www.stripes.com/polopoly_fs/1.351648.1433958651!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_804/image.jpg ) would rather give up , betray or scrap the alliance , the goverments takes decissions . 
  excuse ? 
  you obviously ca n't see irony . 
  you 're lying , the case is in court and they were n't sentenced yet . 
  again you ignore inconvinient facts and change the subject to concentrate on unimportant details . 
  you are lying , the court is not obliged to do anything . 
  the bill about `` invigilation '' was created by the `` liberal '' party and parliamnt was ordered to ammend it by the constitutional court exactly in the points about gathering data , somehow these `` defenders of democracy '' were n't able to execute this sentence for the past two years . 
  you 're not just a liar , but a two face hypocrite , you do n't mind abuse of incorrect journalists if that 's the correct party doing it and then you whine about some imagined `` dictatorship '' just because they 're loosing elections . 
  so it was allright to break in to the office of `` wprost '' because someone else allegedly broke the law ? 
  hopefully we 'll see how these poor , `` illegally monitored '' officials monitored these journalists and their families , but i 'm quite surre that they 'll find few powerful defenders . 
  there is n't such a bill and the law about police , amended on request of the constitutional court , somehow was n't preventing the `` liberals '' to monitor more people than in any other european country . 
  not to mention these journalists and the others during the previous term of conservatives . 
  btw . 
  according to the amended law about police the people responsible of keeping the professional secrets ( journalists , lawyers ) ca n't be monitored without previous permission of the court and the gathered data has to be destroyed immidieatelly if it 's not related to the case . 
  ... and why `` liberals '' attacked wprost in the real world ? 
  neither are those who migrate to germany at now , dishonest politicians and mass medias do n't even use this word anymore and i was using quotation marks for a reason . 
  more like turned against `` liberals '' , which is not surprising after that raid and such a nice `` solidarity '' from the lefty journalists , except for olejnik , which was also `` convinced '' to not complain too much . 
  if you wants to make a `` proper '' argument , tell me how would you react if anti terorists will pay a visit to some left paper like gw or post communist weekly like polityka ? 
  i 'd be outraged despite my personal opinion about these rags . 
  edit : i understand it 's convinient to ignore the other part of my comment , i will be awared with some downvotes for sure , but we both know that this is the sad reality of `` public '' media in poland . 
   dictatorship obviously you have no idea what are you talking about . 
  there 's no more dictatorship in poland since the far lefty regime allowed free elections . 
  in 1989 only 25 % seats in parliament , first completly free elections in 1991 . 
  i understand why the lefty or `` liberal '' politicians and their propagandists cry about `` dictatorship '' when they loose elections , but this is just their political campaign . 
  so what about those 90.000 chechens and about a million ukrainians ? 
  does n't matter because they are n't all over the medias , or are `` refugees '' just these people forced by some quotas from germany ? 
  i know very well what 's a separation of power and there 's no violation of that in poland , if you claims otherwise then it 's you who has to proove it . 
  prosecutor general was the minister of justice until 2010 , why was n't that a problem before ? 
  no matter that personally i 'm against reversing this situation , but the criticism in this point is based purely on ignorance or bias . 
  i can take a joke , but the `` liberal '' politicians and lefty mass medias seems to be serious when they write for example that hungary and poland are more dangerous than isis ( berliner zeitung ) or that all the medias were taken over and `` culture '' nationalised ( suddeutsche zeitung ) . 
  this float is just unimportant joke , but when investors or rating agencies like s&p takes jokes and biased journalism as serious factors then it 's not funny anymore . 
  sorry , i also do n't find rapes , sexual abuse and the whole situation in germany as anything funny . 
  maybe i 'm just grumpy . 
  officially 833.259 visas given from january to december 2015 , unoficially there 're much more ukrainian `` refugees '' in poland . 
  somehow i do n't see the `` right wing nationalists '' chasing them out , but i see employers asking for more and employers organisations asking to grant them permanent residence . 
  so is it me who cries that another gov takes over the public media , just like every other was until now ? 
  foreigners do n't have to know the situation of `` public '' media in poland , but you and the other polish redditors could at least try to not be hypocrites ... 
  wprost is owned by pmpg polskie media s.a. now , why do n't we stop being hypocrites and just admit that the `` public '' media in poland were always just state owned and controlled by gov ? 
  is it really worth to lie and destroy the image of poland just to criticise only a one of these governemnts ? 
  the lefty mass medias were quite suportive towards russian gov or at least ignored and excuses it , until the invasion of ukraine . 
  same way was with the `` liberal '' party that depends on their support . 
  the biggest newspaper `` gazeta wyborcza '' published many interviewes with putin and some of his people , unoficcial boss of that whole medial empire ( agora s.a. ) adam michnik was sometimes hosted in russian state tv channels and papers , but also on the valdai club ... should i continue ? 
  i 'm not butthurted , neither surprised how the polish gov is pictured by `` liberal '' opposition and mass medias , i 'm just surprised that people actually believes in these horror stories . 
  just like every other gov was taking over the `` public '' media . 
  in opposite to donald , he did n't sent anti terrorists to seize laptops and pendrives in `` wprost '' which published some inconvinient recordings , he was n't ordering his befriended media owners to kick out some journalists from `` rzeczpospolita '' and `` uwa\u017cam rze '' , then the most popular weekly magazine ... 
  you seriously thinks in germany that kaczy\u0144ski took power in some military coup like jaruzelski and is opressing people ? 
  that 's indeed quite funny . 
  that 's all nice and interesting , except that the conservative party is not nationalist . 
  tens of thousands chechen and about a million ukrainian `` refugees '' prooves you wrong , but they are n't all over medias because they do n't actually make such problems . 
   poland abolishes the separation of powers and freedom of press . 
  no , it does n't and there 's more freedom of speech here than for example in germany . 
  state owned medias were always controlled by the gov and so it was under the previous gov , but that was the `` correct '' party of merkel stooges so it was allright then . 
  i do n't make him anything , i just answer to some paranoid theories by giving examples of his real , not imagined , political activities . 
  ok , so it was n't half , but these two lefty criminals were the worst , especially kiszczak , responsible for militia and secret police which murdered and tortured many people . 
  should i mention also that the first elections were just quarter `` free '' ( except for senate ) and that dictator jaruzelski was elected by the parliament as the first preisdent ? 
  i guess that he was also better than kaczy\u0144ski , because apparently everybody is ... 
  wikileaks is full of unimportant garbage and still it has nothing to do with any `` coup '' in ukrainian parliament . 
  maybe you just do n't understand how governments are dismissed and voted in , but it does n't matter because there 's absolutelly nothing which could excuse russian invasions and creation of separatist puppet states in ukraine , georgia or moldova . 
  just stop listening to their gov propaganda and think for yourselve about who 's the danger for peace and stability in europe . 
  it 's used by some unknown morons , following this `` logic '' one could say that swastika is a simbol of resistance and vice versa . 
  because this simbol represents what was intended by its creators , no matter some political or ideologic groups trying to exploit it for thier own goals . 
  so now swastika is a `` nationalist '' simbol ... how about the flags ? 
  are the national simbols `` nationalistic '' , or maybe communist since all of them used these ? 
  june 3 , 2015 even if that would be true , it has nothing to do with the so called `` coup '' . 
  not to mention that none of these `` advices '' were realeised and soros is not representing american gov , or any otther . 
   hacked by `` cyber berkut , '' a reliable source lol, 
   as a nationalistic symbol so i repeat my question , since when this is a `` nationalistic '' simbol ? 
  you could also explain what does sfastika have to do with anything here , but i can guess that some people , especially left extremists , consider that as a `` nationalistic '' simbol as well . 
  you mean the `` coup '' when president appointed an internim gov after negotiations with opposition and guarantees of german , french and polish fms ? 
  not to mention that this gov got 3/5 support in parliament ... where 's the role of usa in it ? 
  the etchnic russians are minority in donbass , at first their junta was led by girkin vel `` strelkov '' and borodai , the `` volunteers '' from moscow and they 're obviously supported by russia with weapons and everything else . 
  stop listening to that bullshit propaganda of russian gov. 
  so how does it proove that it 's suddently a `` nationalistic symbol '' ? 
  these vandals were obviously idiots not just because of destroying some jewish tombstones , but also because they put a simbol of german national socialists next to the simbol of resistance against them . 
  russia is the only country in europe that annexed territory of another country since wwii and currently supports an armed junta in donbass to destabilise ukraine . 
  since wwii and colapse of ussr there were wars in moldova , georgia ( three times ) , yugoslavia and currently in ukraine . 
  you 're either misguided or just biased if you ca n't see that russia is a threat to peace in europe and nato quite the opposite way , guaranteeing peace . 
  so what about the sources ? 
  i believe that a `` leader '' which elimintes his critics and shoots at protesting people is a cowardly asshole . 
  then demonstrations were n't so peacefull and turned into a civil war , believe whatever you wants . 
   kotwica as a nationalistic symbol since when ? 
  and even if , they use polish flags , the same as far left regime did , so ? 
  nationalists had their own resistance known as nsz , most of them joined ak anyway . 
  depends , depardieu moved but i 've heard he was complaining recently . 
  it 's a movie star anyway and not just a `` commoner '' . 
  there 're many reasons to complain and life in eu also can be hard ( depends where ) , but that 's no reason to support russia . 
  they really have no idea about russia , but i also do n't think they `` love '' it , it 's just busyness . 
  also russia is simply corrupting some politicians like marine le pean and even the german chancellor schroeder . 
  i 'd say that rather in france and italy , including some politicians , but there are some of them in every country . 
  the most common feature of these people is anti americanism , strongly promoted by kremlin which has no other ideology left . 
  unfortunatelly american foreign policy gives them quite a bit of arguments , but still i ca n't figure out how does it excuse russian policies . 
  yeah , it 's really sad to see so many useful idiots in europe , for some reason just in the countries which are far away from russia and have no idea or experience in dealing with them . 
  do n't know details and i doubt that has anything to do with the crash two years after . 
  i hardly doubt that was the way you picture it , but again , it 's completly different and unrelated event so i do n't even bother to google it and read more . 
  again some made up stories . 
  i understand that it 's absolutelly necessary to accuse the incorrect president of whatever , but why should i care about politicians and propagandist bickering ? 
  you 're just parroting their theories .
