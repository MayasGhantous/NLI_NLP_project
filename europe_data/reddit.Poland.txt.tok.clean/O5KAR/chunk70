  [ sure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_syrian_civil_war_%28january%e2%80%93april_2011%29 ), 
  there was n't rebellion yet , just peacefull demonstrations which were assaulted by the army . 
  you mean the investigators of the previous gov ? 
  the investigators that hear voices of dead generals and build their theories with such professional instruments like their own ears ... 
  it was prooven wrong by the phonoscopic analisis . 
  i guess you mean the `` previous '' flights , two years before , which are not related to this incident and making up some theories of pilots psychic conditions is just not serious . 
  one bullshit does n't make the other right . 
  imagine , it 's possible that all of them are wrong ... 
  i see , so if some demonstration is ( allegedly ) supported by another country then it 's just allright to shoot these people ... and that makes assad a better `` leader '' than some presidential candidates in us . 
  remind me when hilary or donald started massacring demonstrators . 
  ok , i was slightly wrong again , but the bottom point is that was n't in flight , but on the ground . 
  if a soldier ca n't handle orders and pressure then he should just resign , but i guess they 're going through psychologic tests because i ca n't imagine a `` stressed '' pilot in the army . 
  i 'm not a military pilot . 
  political situation in poland is quite stable . 
  i do n't think that these theories and investigations will make any effect , people have already established opinions and very few can change it . 
  the previous gov was making their job so much harder ... 
  he 's simple dumbass . 
  kaczy\u0144ski `` jarek '' stood behind wa\u0142\u0119sa then and made him to run in elections , he also negotiated the first `` non communist '' gov ( with half of communist ministers ) of mazowiecki . 
  i 'm not interested in these paranoid theories and alternative reality . 
  no idea about your age , but i 'm old enough to remember some and fill the gaps in my knowledge from second hand sources . 
  you also see what was shown to you and if not some people we 'd still have no idea about his embarassing alcoholism . 
  these double standards makes the people remember more faults or mishaps of the incorrect president or party than even serious offences of the correct ones . 
  keep watching tvn and reading gw . 
   in the middle of the flight source ? 
  i 've told you that this conversations with pilot took place on the airfield in kiev , a detail that is somehow ignored by the `` fans '' of that president . 
  that 's just a bunch of made up assumptions and theories . 
  i can see the russian answers like ballistic missiles in kaliningrad , constant embargos and provocative maneouvres with belarus , to list just few . 
  in another words , the foreign politics ( if there was any ) of that gov failed miserably . 
  if you still do n't know what i mean , these concessions are visa free movement with kaliningrad , resignation from american abm , supporting russian membership in wto and many more . 
  suddently , after invasion of ukraine , even the monument of soviet `` friendship '' in warsaw is not welcomed anymore ... 
  that was obviously a joke , the same as russian judical system is just layghtable . 
  it does n't change the fact that these controllers were giving wrong commands and informations , which was also registred on the plane recorders since these from the `` tower '' just disappeared , as i 've said . 
  you ca n't dismiss it with some buzz words like `` conspiracy theory '' . 
  you should listen him sometimes , maybe then you 'd admit that he 's just brainless arrogant . 
  what a surprise ... 
  i guess there 's no crime or stupidity commited by these `` correct '' presidents which would change your mind . 
  neither i believe that , but there 're too many questions that ca n't be answered by insults . 
  i thinkt that both of these conspiracy theories , the one in which president ordered pilots to land and the one of assasination , worked well for the `` liberals '' and their ratings . 
  or maybe that 's just my conspiracy theory ... 
  true , i forgot about that . 
  so they finally landed in their destination , or not ? 
  it does n't matter anyway and has nothing to do with the crash in smolensk , except that it serves some wild conspitacy theories . 
  how do you like the monument that komorowski built for the bolsheviks ? 
  ok , seriously these `` liberals '' made a lot of concessions to russia , which includes mishandling the so called `` investigation '' of the crash in smolensk . 
  i could make a whole list of `` friendly '' gestures and decissions , but until the invasion of ukraine these fools regarded russia as a normal country . 
  the same goes for lefty mass medias , which together with russian propaganda accused the conservatives of `` russophoby '' . 
  nobel peace prize that was awarded also to arafat , obama , al gore and eu means nothing . 
  in contrary to the boastful and idiotic declarations of wa\u0142\u0119sa , he was n't alone in solidarno\u015b\u0107 , kaczy\u0144ski was as well and this is not what defeated communism . 
  i was n't asking about a beauty contest . 
  kwa\u015bniewski should be charged at least for giving out polish military base to the foreign secret services . 
  human rights court should accuse him , not the whole state . 
  that 's just your opinion , i say he is simply dumb and embarassing , not to mention that furniture and other stuff which he `` borrowed '' or `` destroyed '' . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.npw.gov.pl/491-49db27c18de2f.htm ) i guess we should kidnap these two controllers like russians did with nadia savchenko . 
  what `` conspiracy theories '' ? 
  there were several transcripts published by that gov , but it has nothing to do with the fault of russian controllers . 
  you should adress these `` jokes '' to the polish military attorney which accused controllers and obviously will not be able to judge them because russia will never allow it . 
  out of context . 
  not ot mention that some of these transcripts were already changed after phonoscopic analisis and there 're like ten different copies , some of which lacks a minute of recording . 
  edit : i believe that there was no conditions to land , but the controllers did n't close the airport and allowed landing . 
   worst president in the history worse than dorky electrician which pardoned a boss of mafia , amongst other `` acheivements '' ? 
  worse than alcoholic post communist which sent our troops to iraq and let cia to run its torture facilities in polish military base ? 
  i should n't mention `` cinkciarz '' komorowski because there 's nothing to talk about . 
   his brother i just love these disgusting conspiracy theories ... 
   were well advised by the russians to not to land no , they were n't . 
  controllers are accused by the polish military attorney at least because they gave wrong commands and informations to the pilots . 
  what warnings ? 
  controllers allowed the plane to land and were giving wrong commands , for example that the plane is on track and course when it obviously was n't . 
  recordings from the `` tower '' disappeared . 
  great , so if everything 's clear russia should give back the plane and recorders . 
  you mean the reaction of the people , or the gov ? 
  as far as i remember there were suspicions from the beginning and gov of russia nad poland blamed pilots and president immidieatelly , a one pro gov tv station even made up `` leaks '' from the recorders claiming that president was thretening lives of pilots if they refuse land . 
  and that 's how the presidents of ukraine , baltic states and poland appeared in tblisi ? 
  the conversation with pilot took place in kiev , on airport and there was armistice . 
  the pilot was awarded by the `` liberal '' gov which until recently loved russia and ignored countries like georgia . 
   he ordered the pilot to land . 
  this conspiracy theory was prooven wrong . 
  edit : dear downvoters , if you can proove this conspiracy theory that president ordered pilots to land , then please come out of hiding and enlightem me . 
  your emotions and opinions about that president are not intertesting for me . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i could guess that there was a division between these two groups , but how did it affected common people , besides of povs ? 
  there was a wallon legion , a waffen ss unit i guess , so they were n't `` untermensch '' for sure . 
  another , little known fact : there was a polish resistance in belgium , not as big as in france , but still . 
  polish 1st armoured division fought in ypres , tielt and ghent , amongst other cities in belgium , then they moved to netherlands . 
   broken democracies like orbans hungary or the more recent polish disaster politics hahaha what ? 
   get rid of their dictators you mean the democratic , elected governemtns ? 
  no thanks for such a `` help '' , comrade . 
   putin friendly one like v4 you 're kidding , right ? 
  ca n't say for sure , but when both the jews and people aiding them were executed then it 's obviously impossible to recognize them . 
  also , communists ran anti `` zionist '' campaign in 1968 and kicked out jews ( or just communists of jewish descent ) from the party , army and administration . 
  that could n't help relations with israel . 
  was there a death penalty for aiding jews in belgium , netherlandes or france ? 
  if so , was it a collective punishment , like execution of a whole family or a village ? 
  as far as i know there was n't and occupation of these countries was quite different , dutch , belgian or french never were considered `` sub humans '' by germans . 
  nord stream 1 was n't right either . 
  it 's a shame that russia can corrupt a leader of the strongest european country ... also merkel and donald after her promised that if the pipe will be blocking port in szczecin and \u015awinouj\u015bcie ( barely opened lng hub ) , it can be moved deeper . 
  this is just another blatant lie . 
  solidarno\u015b\u0107 was first of all a trade union , most of the protests were organised by the workers and had a social and economic background . 
  there were other movements and organisations , but also unorganised protests , many were put down in a brutal way with dozens of victims like in 1956 or 1970 . 
  i guess it depends how you 're measuring it , according to [ world bank ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:bgr:pol:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg&amp;iconsize=0.5 ) bulgaria had sligthly lower gdp per capita by ppp , but then it looks like somthing really bad happened to ukraine . 
  we 've had no concentration camps per se , even if thousands of solidarno\u015b\u0107 leaders were put into some internment camps during 1981 martial law .
