  then you whine that he 's accusing people of something . 
  you do n't get the comparison . 
  the `` progressive '' parties use not just a one party as their symbolic `` enemy '' , these are catholics , conservatives or `` nationalists '' , everything they consider as `` backward '' and opposed to their plans . 
  you thinks they 're all different , but i see just different shades of the same colour . 
  that 's just your opinion . 
  rhetoric of every side is just like that , they 're only referring to different symbolic and `` enemies '' . 
  your comments are pretty good example of that . 
   jews let me guess , it 's another `` stereotypical generalisation '' , but i 'd say that 's just a lie and quite a pathetic one at that . 
  not even the lefty mass medias and politicians are going that far in their grotesque accusations . 
  so , who was complaining about empty promises ? 
  i really do n't care how stalin called his doctrine or foreign policies . 
  not my problem that far left populists ridiculed their own accusations by inflating them . 
  just you 're talking about far right movements while your only knowledge comes from lefty mass medias and the same politicians . 
  i do n't really care how you label the gov of poland , the point is that they 're not blind followers of german gov , unlike their predecessors so i 'm not surprised that your medias and politicians are getting mad . 
  i agree there should be , same as with the leaked tapes and i was complaining about it then , even tried to protest but i 'm not in any organisation or party so , who cares . 
  most of all , the major medias in poland are extremly biased , without their attention and support of some trade unions , parties or such there 's nothing going to happend . 
  the major newspaper gw actually supported that `` coup '' exactly because constitutional tribunal could stop the new gov and it was obvious that the `` wrong '' party is going to win . 
   but generalisation about the steorotypical so that 's why you 're posting that ? 
  great idea . 
  indeed , this paranoya is laughtable . 
  no , they do n't have and just to remind you , it was all started by the previous gov which literally took over this tribunal passing a law with the help of these `` independent '' judges . 
  imagine that there 're democratic countries which does n't have such courts or tribunals so it 's not about any `` democracy '' , despite the hysteric rhetoric of the opposition . 
  it 's done in a stupid and crazy way , provokes conflicts and unites opponents , but this is going to affect their ratings and nothing really special besides that . 
  first of all , it 's good that demonstrations in poland are peaceful and very well organised , except that they 're usually little compared to the other countries . 
  secondly , all of them does n't matter except that they mobilise hard opponents / supporters . 
  the party currently in charge was protesting quite often for the past eight years and they 're well organised also in social networks , grassroot organisations , their own medias and especially in the net . 
  all that matters is that they 're in charge for now with absolute majority in parliament and president from their own camp , if the opponents does n't like this fact , they have to wait four years and use ** democratic ** ways to change it . 
   `` they are not real poles , communists everywhere , pis the only rightful way '' i dare you to get a source of this quote . 
  in regard to `` communism '' and some conspiracy theories both sides use exactly the same rhetoric , except that many of anti gov protestors actually consider communism or jaruzelski junta as `` better '' times . 
  how about personal attacks on kempa , or president ? 
  as for the whole rhetoric in general , it 's wrong on so many levels to compare the present situation to communism or martial law ( same as it was before ) , to say that right after democratic elections there 's a danger for our personal liberties and `` democracy '' . 
  just to be clear , i do n't support rhetoric of either side and usually i do n't like slogans on demonstrations which are pointless anyway . 
   something like this you mean democratic elections , or demonstrations ? 
  i 've seen in berliner zeritung an article which stated that `` hungary and poland are more dangerous than isis '' so really another `` fascist '' reference is too little , try harder . 
  yeah right , except that stalinism was not any ideology and no , it was not just in a one country when it was exported all around the world . 
  i know that legacy of far left regimes is shameful and nobody wants to be associated with it , but no matter if it was lenin , trotsky , stalin or mao , all of the communist dictators were insane mass murderers . 
  every promised a lot , but the campaign of po in 2007 was probably the most childish and populist bullshit i 've ever seen in my life . 
  trade unions , consideration for workers and other social groups with their interests . 
  nationalism is a sister ideology of socialism , but they are n't nationalist at all , just not internationalist or cosmopolite and maybe a bit protectionist . 
  just google that budget for 2009 and the way it was updated . 
  as for the promises of the new gov we 'll need to wait a bit , a bit less than eight years , but most probably it 's not going to end well . 
  still , it 's much more serious than promising `` miracles '' or that everybody 's going to return to poland and so on and so no ... 
  no , it is n't or at least it 's not everything , but the point is that those guys are conservative socialists anyway . 
   will grab all the power they can because power just like it was for the past 8 or 5 years of democracy ... oh wait , that was the correct power grabbing . 
   national conservatives rather conservative socialists . 
   do you remember when kaczy\u0144skis said `` football hools are the best patriots '' ? 
  for comparison - he said `` students are drunk scum '' , and the people that protested yesterday are `` the worst kind of poles '' . 
  i do n't remember . 
  please refresh my memory , but this time quote exactly and with the actual context . 
  pis makes its own demonstrations , not even in the same city as the `` radicals '' ( nationalists in fact ) . 
  the `` extremists '' votes rather for korwin or kukiz , but also not all of them are as much demonic as they 're pictured . 
  for example in 2009 , right after european elections budged was changed . 
  not to mention the stories about qatar investing in our shipyards , which was just a lie . 
  they got this budget from the previous gov which had a habit of making `` optimistic '' plans right before elections . 
  it would be changed as usually , no matter which gov could be in charge . 
  besides , it was done few days ago , they rule since few weeks and the negative trend on stock exchange is continuing since many months . 
   will not be taxated you was suggesting that they 'll not be taxed when they obviously are . 
  nobody makes them any favors , credit unions just are n't banks . 
  most of redditors would n't bother to admit their mistakes . 
  still this is really serious in opposite to the case of bierecki and that was my whole point . 
  they 're paying taxes already and nobody wants to change it , what you 're talking about is additional tax on the banks . 
  ok , i was slightly mistaken . 
  some were [ arrested ] ( http://szczecin.wyborcza.pl/szczecin/1,34959,19118928,sad-w-szczecinie-b-prezes-skok-wolomin-moze-wyjsc-z-aresztu.html ) , not sentenced and the bail set on 1mln . 
  z\u0142oty is quite a big one as for poland . 
  the case of bierecki is considered by prosecution , it 's not even in the court . 
  it seems you was n't searching good enough or just in wrong places . 
  it 's english speaking subreddit and really nobody cares about the fights between the local polish parties , not to mention that the post is about stock exchange . 
  szyd\u0142o said nothing about it , head of her office asked the tribunal why it was proceeding not in the full lineup despite announcements . 
  [ here ] ( http://ppiop.rcl.gov.pl/?r=orzeczenia/index ) and before you start making some excuses i should add that there 's absolutely no legal consequence of such actions and it was criticised by [ marek safjan ] ( http://trybunal.gov.pl/wiadomosci-trybunalskie/wystapienia-publiczne-prezesa-i-wiceprezesa-trybunalu/marek-safjan-2/ ) . 
  so how this gov disregarded constitution ? 
  i thought we 're talking about unconstitutional law , but as for disregarding the sentences of constitutional court it 's unfortunately not a bullshit . 
  they did , exactly the same as previous gov and all the others . 
  no , it 's not serious , at least not as much as the hysteric opposition is suggesting . 
  besides , i was talking about economy . 
  it 's far too soon to judge their actions , especially if nothing really serious happend . 
  also the ministers responsible for finances and economy are considered as the better part of gov. 
   smaller and therefore will not be taxated source ? 
  credit unions are nothing special and they works all around the world , some of these related to the previous gov and president got bankrupt and their heads , in opposite to bierecki , have serious troubles with the law , some were sentenced already . 
  you said it was in constitution , but anyway it 's the law since they 've made this interpretation and it does n't work in past . 
   i 'm repeating my question , where in the constitution it stands that the president has to take the vows without delay . 
  unless you give me an answer , i see no reason to comment your private opinions . 
  yeah , sure but at least i 'm referring to exact chapters and articles . 
  it 's rather pointless to discuss until you back up your words with anything like that , so ... 
  i 'm repeating my question , where in the constitution it stands that the president ** has to ** take the vows ** without delay ** . 
  so where 's that point in constitution ? 
  i 'm waiting ... 
  the law says it clearly , elected candidates are becoming judges only after they swear an oath in presence of president , until then they 're just `` elected persons '' . 
  just read that article 21 . 
  only since the interpretation of tribunal the president is obliged to accept vows `` as soon as possible '' . 
   only ct can take those judges out no , it can not . 
  who said that president broke the constitution ? 
  the judges were elected not because of resolution , the previous ones were dismissed in this way . 
  according to the previous interpretation he should accept the oaths asap so he did that . 
  only then ct decided that just two of them were elected legally , but still it can not affect the law in reverse . 
  really ? 
  show me in which chapter and paragraph of this constitution exactly . 
  read the chapter about constitutional tribunal , art . 
  indeed president has no right to dismiss or oppose a judge , but he has no obligation to accpet the oath , at least he have n't had until the interpetation of tribunal , but it was ** after ** the new judges were sweared in . 
  those elected by the previous parliament are just the `` elected persons '' according to art . 
  yeah , right .
