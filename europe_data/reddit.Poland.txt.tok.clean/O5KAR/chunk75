  maybe you should learn to read and then tell me in which point of that chapter there 's written that president has to do anything `` without delay '' . 
   both potential faction leaders are now tied down by the danger of potential state tribunal charges in case they try to fracture . 
  are you for real ? 
  this is just empty talk of the ( current ) opposition , do n't fall for that . 
  neither gowin , nor ziobro are involved in this mess and just to remind you , the latter one was about to get judged by that tribunal , or at least that 's what we were hearing for the past eight years . 
  oh , you guys looks so cute , plotting to overthrow democratically elected president ... with the hands of his own party . 
  no idea who are you replying to . 
  president has no obligation to take any vows , the judges are obliged to give them in front of president and it 's clearly written in the chapter . 
  so if this tribunal ruled otherwise , then just since their interpretation this is the law . 
  it said also that president should swear all of them in , not just the `` legal '' ones , but since the new parliament elected the others and they were sweared in , those are the new judges . 
  i just love those empty threats and mighty accusations , especially when pis just won elections and nobody really gives a damn about this cynical campaign made by hypocrites who did exactly the same . 
  neither the people , nor the eu , not even reddit cares , try your luck in court . 
  does n't matter . 
  those judges should n't write law for themselves , it 's just unethical . 
  their work is to rule if the law is constitutional , that 's all . 
  we do need as long as we have this constitution , but rzepli\u0144ski lost all of his credibility since he worked together with previous gov on ** unconstitunal ** law and let them appoint five judges instead of three . 
  he should just resign , at least from his position as a head of tribunal . 
   just commited a coup d'etat , according to some people some very funny people . 
  lets not forget to mention that po worked on their `` coup '' together with three judges of this tribunal , including its head rzepli\u0144ski . 
  so , the judges of constitutional court with its head and the ruling party wrote a law which was partly ... unconstitutional . 
  great guys , independent experts according to ** some people ** . 
  ok , so what power has the french parliament if you have the same kind of presidential system ? 
  nobody even knows who 's your pm , if you have any . 
   seriously , it does n't give a good name to ukraine and it 's already established `` tradition '' in your parliament . 
  i 'm afraid not , otherwise guardian would n't write so biased articles or hire some far lefty activists from poland to write for them . 
  the `` public '' tv is the biggest film producer in poland and almost every movie is sponsored from the public money . 
  it was always dependent on politics and if it was possible to make movies about evil poles killing jews , then i see no problem about making something positive for a change . 
  it 's just ukraine , i do n't remember fights in the other parliaments around here . 
  alright , you 're free to have your opinion and i 'm free to disagree . 
  as for the movie i do n't mean just the unicorns or the main character which is some macgyver / rambo mashup , but the whole plot , characters and dialogs which are just poorly written . 
  not just the fantasy parts are inaccurate , but also those supposed to be serious events are all wrong . 
  it 's just a poor movie , not worth to be watched more than once , but ... that 's just my opinion . 
  never heard about it and i see nothing in wiki or google . 
  early polish kings seek their legitimisation rather in the papacy than empire . 
  i 'm just replying to your comments , is there something wrong about it ? 
  there were several jagiellonian kings of bohemaia and hungary . 
  vratislaus ii was never a king of poland . 
  i agree , but the quotas are not any solution and except for ukrainians nobody wants to immigrate here , poles are actually emigrating . 
  greece is not a destination for those `` refugees '' , they 're just passing it in order to get into rich and generous states . 
  not even france is good enough for those people in calais . 
  sorry , but i have no sympathy for this kind of greedy people . 
  watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an0yuhytsh0 ) , it 's hilarious . 
  you must be kidding me ... 1612 is a fantasy bullshit exactly in the style of hollywood fairy tales with typical dialogues and characters trying too hard to be funny or smart . 
  wenceslaus ii and iii were also kings of poland . 
  there was , made by the soviets , but unfortunately it was a bullshit because al did n't took part in the uprising . 
  in warsaw most of these blocks were renovated and painted like [ this ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/84/27/11/z17989252ih,najlepsze-blokowiska-w-warszawie.jpg ) . 
  besides , blocks are not just in the post communist countries . 
  you know that the polish gov agreed to the idea of migrant quotas , right ? 
  we already accepted hundrets of thousands ukrainians , but unfortunatelly they 're too nice so you do n't see them rioting and forcing their way through the borders . 
  it seems that the quotas applies just to the `` special '' people . 
   started the media campaign against immigrants so how did they started it ? 
  also , i do n't remember any anti immigrant campaign in medias since vast majority of those are lefty and they 've made a pro immigrant campaign . 
  also , as someone mentioned already , the previous gov supported the idea of quotas and nobody really cares about any campaigns or comments . 
  you 're barking at a wrong tree . 
  yeah , so when are you going to take quotas of ukrainian immigrants from poland ? 
  not that i 'm complaining about them , but since you 've mentioned actions and consequences ... 
  yes , germany was divided and that was the border between both cold war blocks so that would be the first place of fights . 
  now times are different , the border between east and west moved eastwards and russia is much weaker , it ca n't project its power anywhere besides the post soviet area , except baltic states . 
  the other problem lies in the `` west '' with some political powers still taking russia seriously , considering their threats and interests as valid arguments and ignoring countries like poland even if they have much bigger trading interests with us . 
  it 's hard to predict what would happend in european politics and america also has some isolationist sentiments so i 'd prefer to be secure . 
  that was about to be the frontline , but since nato would bomb eastern germany and poland in response , it was allright for russia . 
  just talk , but some people takes that seriously , especially when they whine about usa and nato . 
  not sure if finnland and sweden are in danger , i do n't suppose that even poland or the other former puppets are , but as for now russia works to keep and expand its influences in former soviet republics . 
  and they 're actually in retreat . 
  depends , red and blue clouds are nukes , red circles are areas of dropping the neutron bombs . 
  i agree , but both the nukes and russian threats are more simbolic than realistic . 
  nukes are paradoxally defensive measures since nobody would risk invasion on a country that owns them , but this is not the case here . 
  it 's not even a serious idea . 
  finnland and sweden were thretened when they considered to join nato , it 's just the russian `` diplomacy '' . 
  if there would be any , i 'm sure that russia would whine alot . 
  so i guess you 're not worried about those threats to poland , finnland or sweden ? 
  you really thinks that you 'd get away if s. . . hits the fan ? 
  btw . 
  the map is an old , declassyfied ( in 1999 ) plan of our mod . 
  [ old news ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wmw6ovq.jpg ) but at least russia is not thretening you openly . 
  just btw . 
  we used to have nukes , but it was secret until 90s and they were all controlled by moscow . 
  yeah , maybe you do n't remember , but this is not our first conversation here and i do n't need to look at your posting history to know who you are . 
  so what about that tribunal ? 
  no matter if you do n't want to discuss it , the point is that gov does n't need any constitutional courts to govern the state . 
  fyi germany is in range of iskanders from kaliningrad . 
  turkey has no nukes and as for this comparation ... seriously ? 
  some berliner rag wrote that hungary and poland are more dangerous than isis , so i guess there 's no comparation which could be more idiotic . 
   political instability what `` instability '' ? 
  opposition goes nuts since they lost elections , but the gov has a stable majority and support of president . 
  i know you hate it , but just get over it and accept the result of elections . 
  anyway , it 's just wishful thinking , or rather empty talk . 
  victoria, 
  then i guess neutral dutch were equally guilty of german invasion in wwii . 
  no offence , but this relativist proverb is just irrational . 
  so now we 're suddently discussing this report ? 
  i told you to read this conversation again from the beginning if you 're lost already . 
  since there 's no single faculty dealing with plane crash investigations there 's not a single person specialised just in it . 
  and as for those `` experts '' of the master miller , all of them except of three ( or four ) doctors hold also master degrees . 
  which comments , please tell the redditors what kind of an evil guy i am , 
  ... why do n't you look at your comment history or just this conversation tree and stop fooling around ? 
  it 's the first time you 're talking about cfit , at least first time with me . 
  well , that 's some progress , at least somone considers other side in these relations . 
  now , if i may ask , what 's the fault of poland in here ? 
  excuse me , but how are you becoming a `` trained aviation specialist '' ?
