  aside of macierewicz , most of his people are professors of the american , australian or candian universities which are ranked far , far above any university in poland . 
  ... why do n't you look it up and compare the names of guys who investigated both of these incidents ? 
  then tell me , which of them were present in both of these commissions . 
  ok , i posted zero videos , podcasts or texts promoting any kind of a party , but you already made up a whole legend about me and my bias . 
  so why are you defending this conspiracy theory if all of these `` evidences '' happend to be faked ? 
  it just does n't make any sense , but there 're still belivers spewing this bullshit every time this crash is mentioned . 
  but hey , he was drunk and `` pressuring '' , on the direct orders of the eeeevil president . 
  was n't he ? 
  if you say so , then i 'm delusional . 
  now tell me , which of those `` experts '' is hearing voices of gen. b\u0142asik in his head ? 
  i 'd really like to know who was responsible for this brilliant analising . 
  you must be kidding me . 
  those guys never investigated any serious crash except for some little planes and baloons . 
  yea rite , except they were supervised by the minister of internal affairs and then manned some body next to prime minister just to `` explain '' their great investigation . 
  tvn is as much `` liberal - conservative '' as cnn is and you , my dear redditor marcoos , you are spamming posts to promote a far left podemos wannabe party `` razem '' , but i 'm the biased one here . 
  fear me , 
  ... so this is that `` evidence '' ? 
  what happend to these leaks and recordings of gen. b\u0142asik ? 
  not to mention that this story was made up by russians in the first moments after the crash . 
  really i do n't give a f. . . about how many downvotes i get for saying that , but this theory was just made up for political reasons and it 's just pitful how many people still belives in it . 
  i 've said it once and i can only repeat , president ordered the pilot to land in tblisis when they were on airport in ukraine with all the presidents of baltic states , right after cease fire was issued . 
  this has nothing to do with the crash two years later . 
  not so much . 
  nobody cares about him anymore . 
  you know very well what kind of medias are in poland . 
  i 'm pretty sure it means bullshit . 
  and i 'm sure i can read and so do you , not to mention listening to such `` brainniacs '' like wa\u0142\u0119sa or assholes like palikot picking up every dirt against kaczy\u0144ski . 
  the mythical `` stance '' in georgia was in fact in ukraine , on airport where pilot was questioning the security of landing in tblisi right ** after ** the cease fire was issued . 
  there 's nothing in common between those two flights , unless you really have to make up theories in order to blame someone . 
  i mean especially those `` journalists '' who fabricated and repeated the infamous leaks and even after that was prooven false , pushed this theory just becouse they always hated this president . 
  i guess he means the fanatic belivers of lefty massmedias which created a conspiracy theory of president `` pressuring '' the pilots and actually killing himselve with the others . 
  oh and lets not forget the mysterious call from his brother , undoubtfully ordering to execute the whole master plan of suicide . 
  yeah , it would be good if they 'd open an international investigation with some experienced experts , not those local amateurs or some scientists working with ( currently ) ruling party . 
  unfortunatelly they wants to make the same `` mistake '' as donald and run a gov comission , but this time the gov has no support of lefty massmedias . 
  ok , so how are your relations with those countries now ? 
  are they still in denial and insulting you with some ancient propaganda or excuses ? 
  now look at our relations with germany and ask yourselve a question why we can get along with them and why ca n't we have normal relations with russia ... 
  i guess it must the fault of poland , right ? 
   president of poland might have talked the pilots into continuing dangerous approach and is responsible for the death of all those people ... and again this conspiracy theory . 
  fine , give me a ** single ** evidence which is not a fabricated leak for the use of presidential campaign of komorowski or speculatiuons of some lefty `` journalists '' . 
  just becouse pis would n't let it go and shut up they 've lost all the elections since 2010 until now . 
  the only reason that po was winning was the big bad boogeyman kaczy\u0144ski . 
  it 's just a meaningles label , not to mention that euractiv is sponsored by ec . 
  the current gov of poland is `` eurosceptic '' just becouse it 's criticising some of the eu policies , but this party was always advocating our membership and mobilised its voters when there was accesion referendum . 
  blame your politicians , it 's not like we forced you to enlarge eu and i really do n't think that you see what 's the real problem here . 
  not even all of the western europe countries are comparable , take portugal , spain or italy for example . 
  actually not even western and easterrn germany are . 
  just fyi it 's just your opinion . 
  my opinion is that 's a good move and should be welcomed also by the euro onanists unless they really thinks that eu is better without uk and some other eeeevil member states . 
  you do n't get it , it 's not just about one or the other person , but about the state , goverment . 
  you also admit that present russia , not just becouse of people in charge , is a sucessor of that state , its politics and identity . 
  it serves their nationalism as it used to do , repeats the same propaganda and excuses for each and every criminal policy . 
  excuse me , but eastern germany is still anything but success , the division is still vivid in population , economy or methality and billions of investments does n't cxhange it . 
  your cpomparation is false at least because french and english were real identities which were promoted just like the new identity of russians , in fact created by moscow and spreaded , often in brutal ways , in novgotod and other conquared areas . 
  the conflict of nagorno karabach is actually settled now which ca n't be unfortunatelly said about georgia or absolutelly artificial etchnic conflict in ukraine which is more an effect of current policies of moscow than something which existed before . 
  the reality is that russia deserves alot of criticism , but is unable to face it and review its old communist mythology . 
  i supose there 's no need to do it since that helps the goverment . 
  yes , i agree that could be just to make administrating this `` empire '' a much easier task , but the result was the same . 
  it 's true that by cleansing , expulsions and colonisation they were able to ease some etchnic conflicts , but they created some more of that and we can just watch the consequences of this policy in post soviet areas where still are many conflicts , often promoted by russia . 
  that 's your opinion , i ca n't say what was the real opinion of separate republics about their `` union '' before the referendums . 
  creation of a common , artificial identity is utopic and unrealistic task without already existing nationality so russyficiation seemed like an easier way . 
  if they 'd really want a buffer , they should refuse `` non agresion '' pact and alliance with germans since they 'd not risk a war on two fronts . 
  this treaty not only destroyed poland , but also pushed romania and finnland into the german sphere of influence . 
  beliving in german and soviet war propaganda is foolishnes . 
  both , except that treaty of versaillese was n't dealing with the eastern border of poland , but they 've had a common ground with germans since both considered themselves as `` victims '' of wwi . 
  which `` nationalists '' ? 
  soviets spreaded the russian language , moved borders and millions of people in line with some ancient mythology and also promoted this idea of `` united '' ru\u015b , panslavism or such . 
  and they were far more effective than the german tzar . 
  really it does n't matter what was their reason and who got this idea , what really matters are their murderous etchnic policies . 
  it was , amongst several other etchnic policies , but stalin was neither georgian , nor russian , he was just a communist . 
  i know and it was just becouse they lost elections to srs of kerensky . 
  the ocotober revolution was merely a lenin 's coup . 
  unfortunatelly it all happend and it 's too late to change it . 
  what we can do is to learn from that harsh lesson to not repeat the same mistakes , but unfortunatelly todays russia repeats many of them together with the same propaganda . 
  no , there 's a difference when you take a phone book and search for people with some `` wrong '' names becouse every one of them is suspected `` traitor '' . 
  that was a classic etchnic cleansing , no matter their excuses . 
  yea i know , most of these `` counterrevolutionaries '' were in fact srs or mensheviks . 
  i 've said it already in another comment , internationalists have no nationality . 
  the polish socialists were also divided , the internationalist faction tried to take over the power with the red army in 1919 , you know how it ended up . 
  sure , all of the killed and enslaved people were the `` enemies '' ... 
   communists did n't give two shits about whether you were ... really ? 
  why then they ordered to kill every polish person ( or suspected ) in 1937 and why did they expelled about 1.7 m of them from eastern poland , after they took it over with hitler ? 
  i know i 'm being selfish , but this is just a one example of their etchnic policies , so yes ... they did cared about nationality . 
  in case of collectivisation and the other femines , it 's disputed . 
  at the cost of tens of millions victims and slave labour . 
  yeah , the piles of corpses were the best evidence of this `` success '' . 
  read about collectivisation , kolhoz , `` kulaks '' and so on ... 
  i do n't really care if communists were plain massmurderers or idiots , i 'd say they were both . 
  the effect was horrible , whatever the reason or excuses . 
  the soviets blamed the farmers . 
  no , not at all . 
  there was a civil war in russia for a reason . 
  it 's just now when they mix the nationalism with old soviet propaganda and simbolism . 
  sure , `` share '' with kolhoz means `` give or die '' . 
  mismanagement was the whole idea of that state . 
  internationalists have no nationality . 
  stalin , as every communist was homeless . 
  yes there are , it 's just doubtful if it had etchnic background directed exactly against a one nation . 
   human errors nicely said . 
  this is what happends when you enforce insane ideology despite every reason and when it fails ... you push even harder and blame the people , farmers in this case .
