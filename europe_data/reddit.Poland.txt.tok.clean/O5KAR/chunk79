  are you nuts ? 
  you obviously forgot to mention that this `` nationalist '' and antisemite faction in 1968 was a faction of the communist party and this was all about the power struggle inside it . 
  apparently poles have to be ashamed of a goverment that was installed by a foreign power , but the people like dictator jaruzelski are just `` tragic heroes '' . 
  so , again the big bad `` west '' made poor little russia to invide its former colony ... 
  i agree it was a mistake to trust that the russian regime is civilised and predictable . 
  the future of ukraine , or any other country , with moscow would be the same as its past and if you thinks that the politicial and economic situation of that country is not related to this dependence , than you must be a fool . 
   better , or even just normalized , relations with russia we tried , the problem is that they see every concession as a weakness and exploit it for their own advantage . 
  russia is `` messing '' with poland at least since 20 years , but you do n't hear about embargos , nuclear threats or pure insults in your massmedias . 
  i 've said it already , we should send our forces there , but nobody considers going to iraq ... again . 
  our politicians are useless and i would n't blame france for cooperating with russia when we do n't do it . 
  as much as i always disliked putin , he 's right in here . 
  this is not the best , but the ** only ** solution . 
  i wish we would , but most of all i wish we would n't go with usa and uk to iraq in the first place . 
  it 's partly our fault what happend after that and especially becouse of that we should send in troops or at least air force . 
  unfortunatelly , nobody 's going to support this idea in poland , complaining is always easier ... 
  yeah , i remember also those comments like `` they provoked it '' . 
  i was n't making any point actually , i 'm just not forgetting so easy like some medias . 
  no , i do n't say anything like that . 
  i say that they both do actually the same thing , but just a one gov is facinmg such a shitstorm . 
  president has no such duty . 
  ... do n't you think that the law itself is wrong if it 's possible to do such things ? 
  and then the tribunal would judge legality of it 's own choice , this is the real mockery . 
  actually , how can i trust those judges if they were working on the previous `` coup '' and refused to reveal the project of a bill until they were forced by the administrative court ? 
  i mean of course meddling with the law to install their judges when it was clear they 're going to loose elections . 
  the real problem is not that a one or the other parliament majority is choosing judges , but just the way it 's done . 
  this prooves how weak and dependent is constitutional tribunal in poland . 
  have you heard that few years ago a former member of ruling party shot dead a member of opposition and nearly cut throat of another ? 
  where werte these medias then ? 
  typical fearmongering . 
  not to mention that the same was done few months ago by the previous gov , but that was the `` correct '' party so whatever they do is allright . 
  bunch of hypocrites ... 
  prepare yourselves for years of lefty whineing . 
  maybe becouse of soviets who draw these borders and moved millions of people . 
  the polish towns on the east were mostly destroyed and abandoned while german were resettled and rebuilt . 
  the so called `` curzon line '' was just a propsal made by some british politicians during the polish - bolshevik war , except for the bug river the eastern and northern borders of poland looks like drawn with a ruler . 
  first map is actually about population change . 
  rather the [ `` green lungs '' ] ( http://www.bdl.lasy.gov.pl/portal/media/default/htmlwidget/2.png ) ( masurian lakes are missing ) of poland . 
  the word `` refugee '' was actually misused by the politicians and medias so i 'd not be suprised that people also confused these with economic migrants . 
  which medias gives a bad name to this word exactly ? 
  yeah , right ... somehow i do n't see slovakia unsubscribing from un or eu . 
  the `` worst '' they can do is what they 've said already , ignoring german dictate in case of `` quotas '' . 
  then the question is pointles since , as i 've said , all of these states are obliged to follow the international rules . 
  obviously this survey was made in the context of current crisis and the idea of peoples `` quotas '' so the people answered just considering this case , or they 're just clueless . 
   that it is n't producing refugees there 're about 1,4 m idp in ukraine . 
  except that [ hundrets of thousands ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society ) are in poland already . 
  same was with about 90.000 chechens some years ago and guess what ... they all left for western europe . 
   human right of asylum they do n't seek that right in here , your oh so good politicians wants to kick them out to our countries . 
  as every subscriber of un human rights charter we have to respect the asylum rights , but there 's nothing in there about any `` quotas '' sent from another countries . 
  your `` moral '' arrogance is just disgusting . 
  maybe becouse most of people in that `` union '' were russians , but it was quite different in separate `` republics '' . 
  hard to compare it with czechoslovakia which was created peacefully after wwi and dissolved also in a civil way . 
  impossible becouse of such disputes and hostilities in early post wwi period . 
  the borders were n't just established by peacefull agreements and popular plebiszites . 
  relations between these countries were really bad and none of them tried to ease the tensions . 
   president of the 2nd polish republic he was never a president , only `` head of a state '' during the war with bolshevik russia . 
  poland is not stronk enough , but still too much to need support of the other three states . 
  ... we do n't make the rules , the structural and other funds were long time before we entered eu . 
  also , the `` refugees '' are not coming here , just passing by , it 's rather the opposite way if you do n't count 90k chechens and about 800k ukrainian `` gast arbeiters '' at least in poland . 
  there 's also a small german minority in upper silesia . 
  if you mean nationalists , then i do n't think they 're using torches , for an obvious reason , but they 're called `` fascists '' anyway . 
  the only march like that was organised by pis , which is quite social conservative and obviously they were bashed for that , as usually . 
  allright , but some people forgets that romanticism was not the only period in literature . 
  best book ... it all depends on what you like . 
  hard to choose , but besides of nobel prize winners like sienkiewicz ( quo vadis ) , i liked `` przedwio\u015bnie '' of \u017beromski , everything from kapu\u015bci\u0144ski or kochanowski ( renaissance poet ) and many more . 
  people say that sapkowski or lem are good , but i 'm not into fantasy or s/f . 
  if i 'd need to choose a one book , that 'd be `` wedding '' by wyspia\u0144ski , do n't know if it was ever translated and it could be probably hard to understand without the knowladge about xix/xxc social and political situation . 
  most ** xixc ** polish books ... ftfy, 
  you 're a sad troll . 
  now i see . 
  you 're just nuts . 
  you 're wasting your time . 
  i know very well the theories made up by the sect of `` wyborcza '' . 
  i 'm not going to comment pathetic insults and paranoid ideas of something i 've never said . 
  ... do you even understand what are we talking about ? 
  the fabricated `` leaks '' were about gen. b\u0142asik `` pressuring '' the pilots , that was the conspiracy theory i was talking about . 
  sure , because every `` putinbot '' criticise donald and vladimir . 
  i do n't need to imagine anything , it 's enough i see how serious goverments secures and investigates evidences . 
  just look at them and compare . 
  phonoscopic expertise prooved that there was no voice of gen. b\u0142asik recorded . 
  the one who heard the voices was wrong , whoever that `` expert '' was in gov comission . 
  experts which made this and the other mistakes , `` borrowed '' pictures from some blogger and admitted that they had `` no time and money '' to investigate the wreckage ... not to mention that they were experienced in investigating little planes and balloon `` events '' . 
  calm down . 
  obviously i 'm using bitter irony , but the fact remains that gov and its propagandists made up a theory for political use and that was pushed since the first-second day after crash . 
  the freedom of expression and gatherings is guaranted by constitution , you have no choice but to accept their existence . 
  many people are criticising them , but mostly becouse of ideological bias which is actually making them more popular . 
  still , i would n't overestimate the `` danger '' or importance of these people . 
  i see that some do n't understand simple words . 
  the pathetic way in which gov of donald handled this issue makes some people to suspect that they 're hideing something . 
  personally , i think they 're rather incompetent and cynical fools . 
  guess again . 
  indeed , it 's a pity that so many people belives in `` pressure '' conspiracy theory just becouse of their politically motivated hatred . 
  fabricating `` leaks '' and accusing someone of killing his twin brother during a presidential campaign is probably the most disgusting move i 've ever seen in `` politics '' . 
  yeah , nobody suspects the gov of putin and tusk of covering it up ... 
   leaked cockpit transcript from 2010 disaster that killed 96 reveals crew were made to attempt landing , undermining theory of russian sabotage there was nothing like that in the transcripts . 
  this `` leak '' was a fake made up during the presidential campaign and served komorowski for disgusting accusations . 
  officially the `` pressure '' theory was prooven false . 
  it just shows the way that this `` investigation '' was carried out and provokes suspicions . 
  not to mention the way that russia handled evidences , especially wreckage . 
  just a one question to the ones who belives in result of the official `` investigation '' . 
  just tell me , is [ that ] ( https://youtu.be/nuzoy0fwwuy ) the way you secure evidences ?
