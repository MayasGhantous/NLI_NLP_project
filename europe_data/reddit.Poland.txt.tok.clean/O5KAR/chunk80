  i do n't have any theories , except for the one that russians , gov of donald and their propagandists spreaded this `` pressure '' conspiracy theory to discredit the dead president and his brother . 
  i do n't see any ukrainians spreading the `` pressure '' conspiracy theory . 
   kaczy\u0144ski forcing the crew to land `` je\u015bli nie wyl\u0105duj\u0119 zabij\u0105 mnie '' ... conspiracy theory made up by goverment to accuse opposition . 
  i 'm sick and tierd of this bullshit . 
   polish president helped russia to do it by forcing his pilot this conspiracy theory was already prooved false , but still there 're some nutjobs beliving in it . 
  you mean the `` pressure '' conspiracy ? 
  seriously how do expect people to belive in this `` investigation '' ? 
  have you actually followed the way that serious countries like netherlands or russia are investigating plane crashes which involved their citizens ? 
  come on , you 're obviously reffering to the nationalists , but they 're an extreme minority here with no popular support . 
  it 's just once a year when all of them are gathering in warsaw , but still this demonstration is far less violent than many strikes or protests in the other countries . 
  allright , i admit my fault . 
  still i do n't think that you can call it `` hostile '' , at least not from our side . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._cities_with_large_polish-american_populations ) you have a list of american cities by the number of polish americans . 
  2011 uk census claims 158,300 polish born residens . 
  ah , now i get it . 
  unfortunatelly it 's not that simple as a regular transaction between two people and i hardly doubt that it 's germany which gets the benefits here . 
  your gas prices are far smaller than ours already and that 's all becouse of politics . 
  i 'm not sure if i understand you . 
  and that 's exactly what russia , with your help , is doing . 
  they 're not the only ones . 
  you 're confusing ukraine with [ belarus ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazoci%c4%85g_jama%c5%82%e2%80%93europa#/media/file:yamal-europe.png ) . 
  there 's no economic reason behind this project , gas is not going to be cheaper , but it 's just about politics and this is why lithuania and poland refused to join it . 
  fair enough , but you 're obviously relying on russia , norway and netherlands , besides the transit through our territory . 
  actually poland is a bigger trading partner for germany , but it 's not controlled by the state owned companies . 
  ok , but / u/kuyajohnny said that germany does n't want to rely also on poland , so i 'm just wondering why is that since , as i 've said , it 's not about transit fees . 
  eh , the military and economic policies makes people to migrate ... 
  besides , you wants us to share your problems , but when we have some issues it 's like you said , everybody 's on their own . 
  then i see complains that we 're cooperating with americans . 
  for many years our gov tried to appease russia with different gestures like free trade with kaliningrad , open universities for their citizens or `` resetting '' that abm deal with americans . 
  in return we get constant food embargos , nuclear missiles on our border and provocative maneouvres with belarus which scenarios included cracking down polish minority or bombing warsaw . 
  still there was no serious reaction until they invaided ukraine , which is our neighbour and obviously concerns us . 
  i 'm asking again , how is poland `` hostile '' towards russia ? 
  and how is it `` less hostile '' to germany ? 
  if it 's just about history then the difference is that you could get over it while they 're still stuck in soviet mythology , but it 's just history . 
  yeah and you know what ... that gas would be cheaper since gazprom set its prices for poland far higher than for germany , but there would n't be enough of it to supplie our demands . 
  our former goverments signed some terrible contracts for yamal pipeline , for which we do n't take any fees , but we have to take gas excuse me , but how are we `` hostile '' ? 
  your immigrants are your own problem as much as it was ours when there were coming chechens or ukrainians at now , so excuse me if i 'm going to be `` hostile '' and criticise the agressive regime which affects also us not just with arrogant threats or constant embargos . 
  not illegall since nobody prooved that he was bribed , but getting a position in this company right after resignation looks like a bribe to me . 
  we also take alot of gas and especially oil from russia , it 's in everone 's interest to have resources , but especially in their interest is to sell it since they produce absolutelly nothing else . 
  it 's not just about sponsoring their arms race , but when you deal with a monopolist you 're becoming dependent on him . 
  as for `` reliability '' of russia [ here ] ( http://szczesniak.pl/files/gazprom-ceny-europa-2012-izviestija.jpg ) you can see how much is gazprom charging each european country . 
  as well as invasion and takeover of crimea was planned since a long time , until there was a reason to execute it . 
  it 's not a concidence that both nord and south streams were about to overpass former russian satellites or `` unstable '' countries where moscow was uncertain of its power . 
  this guy should be charged for corruption , but i guess he 's just a one of many . 
  it means only that germany was equally `` reliable '' for russian interests . 
  if you wants to be even more dependent and run by corrupted politicians , then be my guest . 
  ... and who wants you to pay for it ? 
  as i 've said , poland is charging zero fees for transit and this pipe is not going to make it cheaper . 
  as for eu , it looks like that 's just another tool of your politics , you talks about `` solidarity '' only when it serves your interests , but now you tell me that every country should deal with moscow on their own . 
  do n't be naive , it 's all about ukraine . 
  and just before resignation he signed a contract for nord stream , such a concidence that he 's a president of this company at now ... 
  i do n't even know how many times moscow was issuing embargos on our frood in recent 20 years , rising gas prices and not allowing us to charge transit fees , but you call it a `` reliable '' partner . 
  if you 'd ever have any issues with krtemlin , be sure that they 'll use your dependence on their gas in every possible mean , mind that you 're not dealing with private market economy . 
  i 've answered already in the other comment and i agree with / u/andrei _ tv . 
  you 're just too blinded to see anything besides the money , but it 's much more . 
  there 's an issue in ec about charging different prices for eu members , which is obviously dependent on poilitics . 
  as long as you keep quiet and do n't criticise moscow , you 're going to get your gas cheaper than we do , especially if your highest aurhorities are corrupted by gazprom ... 
  poland can manage on its own , already half of our demands are supplied by alternative sources and few days ago there was openend lng port which would be able to replace 3/4 of russian supplies . 
  ukraine is in big troubles . 
   germany doesnt want to rely on ukraine or poland so you wants to rely on russia , but what 's the problem with poland ? 
  we 're not even charging any fees for gas transit , which is actually wrong . 
  also that pipe of schroeder is blocking access to the port in szczecin for bigger ships , it should be never constructed there . 
  why then eu was opposing south stream ? 
  russia is as much unreliable and corrupted state , but pushing ukraine even further into bankrupcy and europe into dependence on russia is not worth it . 
  really ? 
  so far i saw how western europe was loosing it over orban , not you 're going to have more `` reasons '' to whine ... 
  but anyway , people have no idea about portugal here , honestly i do n't remember the last time i 've heard anything about it . 
   afraid of being flooded with muslims ... xenophobic you have no idea . 
  conservative parties are popular in many eastern countries since a much longer time and this is partly reaction to the years of lefty dictatorship and corrupted post communist goverments . 
  the question of illegall immigrants is quite recent . 
  for example [ invasion of czechoslovakia ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/02/new-russian-invasion-documentary-dismays-czech-slovak-governments ) or [ invasion of poland ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/6118282/russia-and-poland-trade-insults-on-70th-anniversary-of-world-war-two.html ) and this is just a one of many examples , [ recently ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34369487 ) there was more of that , obviously related to the invasion of ukraine which is also suported by the russian people and criticised by europe . 
  i 'm not sure if censorship passed this comment or both of them since i was informed by a bot that it 's not allowed to link daily mail ... 
  yes , all of that is true . 
  still , even if simbolic the existence of poland as a state made it easier to `` transform '' it and join the opposite side with nato and eu . 
  besides of the territorial or etchnic issues i 've mentioned already , it 's in a way a continuation of that state . 
  ok , but the control was not as direct as in ssrs , there 're no issues with borders , russian minority or national identity and language . 
  it was satellite , but still a separate state . 
  yes , but it 's something different . 
   i do n't mean just the purges i mean especially excuses for invasions and occupations that your gov and its medias repeats after communist propaganda . 
  the ones who should pay are dead since a long time . 
  russians should n't compensate anybody , but it would be just decent to admit what was bad and teach the people what is good to not repeat the past and i do n't mean just the purges . 
  currently your goverment does the opposite . 
  thanks , i guess we all have similar stories , but i was just wondering how your father get away from that `` polish operation '' in which your grandfather was executed . 
  as for the label , it was `` ideological '' operation in theory and declarations of nkvd , but in reality when every person of some etchnic background is considered as an `` enemy '' and executed it looks more like an etchnic cleansing . 
  at lest that 's my opinion . 
  three days ago president of poland offered [ help ] ( http://www.nineoclock.ro/polish-president-duda-in-bucharest-we-are-shattered-by-the-tragic-colectiv-accident-poland-to-help-with-specialists/ ) on his visit in bucharest . 
   he said that he wanted to add more to his regret , namely to say that there are specialists at a hospital at siemianowice slaskie who can treat patients of such accidents and that can be of assistance . 
  the half that is n't polish anymore . 
  besides , these states are also sucessors of ussr so in theory poland could demand compensations from them , as well as germany from poland ... 
  it 's a pandora box . 
  impossible , at now russia is more interested in rehabilitating the deeds and excuses of soviet union for all of its invasions . 
  anyway , it 's not about compensations or money , i 'm more afraid of demoralisation of the people reasoning the criminal policies of soviet regime . 
  if i may ask , how was that possible your father survived ? 
  also , are people aware of that etchnic cleansing ? 
  the compensations for crimes against humanity are given to the families if their dead relatives are rehabilitated and considered as victims , which was refused by russian courts in 2004 . 
  several families applied to the european human rights tribunal which said that russia humiliates the families , but the massacre was a war crime and it ca n't be judged there since ussr did not sign the human rights charter . 
  massacre was still `` nothing '' compared to the expulsion of about 2 millions people from eastern poland or the nkvd `` polish operation '' in 1937 when every polish ( or related ) person in ussr was executed . 
  poland was not a part of soviet union . 
  eu is not a military aliance . 
  it 's a nato program , which includes also mediterranean countries such as spain and portugal .
