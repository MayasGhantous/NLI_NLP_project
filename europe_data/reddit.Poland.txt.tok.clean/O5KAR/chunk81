  those are , or rather would be ( someday ) defensive systhems , in opposite to what was installed ** already ** in kaliningrad and sure we just love it ... 
  so if americans are really interested , they should thank putin for making it even more reasonable with offensive missiles , provocative maneouvres and arrogant threats just right after that foolish `` reset '' . 
  then you tell me that poland is your `` enemy '' just becouse it wants to have defensive measures ? 
  do n't make me laught . 
  yeah , lets not provoke russia . 
  we just need to give up our defences and alliances , just then we 'll be no longer an `` enemy '' . 
   just do n't install usa rockets and radars near russian borders . 
  so where are these ? 
  last time i 've checked the ** idea ** changed to intercept short and medium distance rockets , so to defend europe , not usa which is far closer from sibiria . 
  you give us reasons to consider that and our own defence system ( under construction ) with provocative manoeuavres which scenarios include nuclear strike on warsaw . 
  obviously you 're missing the point about who is thretening who . 
  ten years is quite a bit of time and as for backup , the [ funny thing ] ( http://us-foreign-aid.insidegov.com/l/145/russia ) is that russia gets far more us foreign aid than any other country . 
  i think that everything 's possible , but there will be no `` leaks '' about what dirty job was going on in tajikistan or russia . 
  and in which part is that true ? 
  whatever the reason , most of people do n't know , nor care about this day , there 's not a word about it in medias . 
  poles cares more about balistic missiles in kaliningrad . 
  i was rather referring to the penalty , for being a jerk you can be ignored or ridiculed , but nobody would bother to report `` hate speech '' to some authority . 
  i 'm quite sure people are not so strict and uptight here . 
  at least most of them . 
   there is no solidarity with the people fleeing from war ... we accepted over 90.000 chechens in 90s , now there 're hundrets of thousands ukrainian `` gast arbeiters '' or just immigrants and their numbers are rising rapidly . 
  for both of these people poland is a neighboring country and they 're coming willingly , not becouse of some artificial `` quotas '' enforced by another countries . 
  the current immigration wave is going through multiple safe countries , which are unable to register and control them , just to get into some rich welfare states . 
  it does n't look like desperation to me ... 
  quite ironic , but the reason is that the lefty regime was enforced here under military occupation and puppet goverments so the people knew exectly what to oppose . 
  brainwashing was far stronger here , but it was much more primitive and less beliveable . 
  ... comparing some negative comments with a genocide . 
  really clever . 
  no matter how irrational it is , the jews and especially their `` supporters '' are the biggest reason for these negative opinions . 
  you ca n't expect sumpathy from the people you 're just insulting . 
  you obviously never heard about [ statute of kalisz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_kalisz ) . 
  that was xiiic . 
  as for negative opinions , it 's not yet forbidden here to have such and as for peacefull co-habitation it 's not working well in france or the other countries with similar policies . 
  and yes , the people often defend themselves when they 're being insulted and accused in general , sometimes with equally ridiculous accusations . 
  respect has to be mutual , not just one sided . 
  i really hate it . 
  we have museums and centers of modern `` art '' already , there 's no need to put this container in the busiest spot of the city ... 
  it would be the best to make a nice and big park in there with open public spaces , but then nobody would waste that much of the public money for something completly unncessary and ugly as hell . 
  it 's going to drain the money even after construction and i can bet that it 's not going to attract any serious numbers of visitors . 
  thanks , but i know this one . 
   xenophobic rhetoric for example ? 
  so , what was the reason to dismiss them ? 
  in poland that 's quite typical and never works because gov has the majority in parliament , even today opposition wanted to dismiss the minister of defence , a while before nato summit and even the leftist journalists consider that an irresponsible move . 
  did it really ? 
  french economy was quite stagnant even before and as a mayor $ zone member state it 's also responsible for the way it works , or do n't . 
  i do n't tell you what to do , quite the opposite , i want the internal policies of member states left for national governments , only common and external issues should be resolved by the union . 
  i agree that it 's a major challange and eu with its policies failed to improve it so far , only spain shows some recovery but eveywhere in south grows far left movements which wants more spending , social privillages and no `` austerity '' . 
  once you give something to the people it 's very hard to take it back . 
  ... no , you 're still missing my point . 
  i 'm nobody to make any decissions or proposals , i just tell you what 's my opinion and it 's not `` harmonization '' to our level because that would be ridiculous , i just say that your socialist policies slows down and destroys your economy . 
  poland could be an example in many cases , at least in ecnomic growth but not yet the wealth , i also like the way that people are peacefull and calm in here , they do n't vandalize cities , steal and burn when they 're protesting and police is not so `` tolerant '' to criminals but fair . 
  in general not just economy improved greatly since the bankrupcy of leftist regime , also crime and corruption constantly decrease to the level below spain and especially italy . 
  no idea , there 's no issue of that project anyway since even parliament decided it 's not valid and works on a new one . 
  that was my whole point . 
  again , poland is a member of eu and so the agreement you 're talking about is an internal issue of the union , the question is if poland violated it , or not . 
  yes and as i 've said eu and its members decided 12 years ago . 
  can we move on and treat each other as equals ? 
  i 'm really sorry about that and i wish we could help . 
  we do n't have a `` good '' economy , poland is still quite a poor country and i do n't want you to `` stfu '' but i also wants to say something , just like the other members because in theory that should be an union of equal members and everybody should be heard . 
  your policies could have something to do with your debt and suffering economy so maybe we could `` harmonize '' these in some other way than just accepting your socialist and expensive privillages ? 
  industry and production is escaping to asia anyway and you ca n't `` harmonize '' social privillages with the whole world, 
  which we 're a member of with all the rights and obligations , at least in theory . 
  i have no problem , you chose poland to join the union some 12 years ago and we chose that as well . 
  it would be just decent if you could treat us as a member and not a candidate which has nothing to say and more conditions to fulfill . 
  cooperation is always between at least two sides and it can have different forms or levels , a conflict in one field does n't mean that it 's impossible in the others . 
  sounds like a good plan to avoid justice . 
  is juppe the same pro russian as sarcosy ? 
  what 's his idea of foreign relations and the shape of eu ? 
  so it 's our fault now ? 
  poland subscribed fiscal compact and commited 40 bln $ to it , even if it has its own currency , whole union pays for bailouts and these are the ideas and responsibility of ecb and euro zone in general . 
  real decissions are taken `` behind closed doors '' in every parliament or goverment , the rest is some irrelevant bickering and pr . 
  you do n't have to accept any `` social dumping '' ( ? ), 
  but you did accepted our membership the same as we did accepted your conditions and policies , including cohesion funds and others . 
  eu needs reforms indeed but i just thinks it needs different change than the one you and internationalists propose , i even think that this will destroy eu finally and that 's not what i want . 
   nine rulings which the government does not publish good to know ( and thanks for the link , i 'll read that ) but as i 've said the courts recognise these . 
  as for now i do n't know any new law that was sued to the tribunal , it ca n't just judge everything without being asked to . 
  poland does n't want to exit and neither pis wants , or at least does n't want to loose majority but i must admit that the conflict with eu and pathetic behaviour of `` liberals '' gives them a crushing majority in opinion polls . 
  still , schulz and juncker ca n't just kick out a member state they do n't like , the only way out is by referendum . 
  no problemo , that 's also why i 'm here . 
  yes , the gov refused because of what i 've said , unclear loopholes in constitution . 
  the courts and local govs where the `` liberals '' rule declared that they 'll respect the ruling of tribunal regardless of publication . 
  it would be better , same as in case of previous gov and its law which actually started the whole mess , but it happened and the situation of judges is still unclear . 
  is sarkozy even allowed ? 
  should n't he be in prison actually ? 
  now you 're making drama and overreacting . 
  if you really do n't want a free trade , movement and exchange of services then just get out of eu because these are the basic and most important issues on which the community was built . 
  you have your patliament , gov and president to represent your interests in the international organisations like un or eu . 
  why ? 
  unless eu goes full retard and tries to humiliate , dictate and punish poland then i ca n't imagine growing majority for that . 
   the core of the issue is a new law the law was called unconstitutional , which also caused some problems because in theory tribunal should judge it in accordiance to presumably constititional law , but that 's the problem with unclear constitution and loopholes in it . 
  anyway , that law is not an issue because it does n't work , the parliament works on a new one . 
  that 's nice , i love you too . 
   theocracy eh ... and i was hoping that this is a serious comment . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  edit : i was thinking just about the europe and empires like austria - hungary . 
  no , you do n't get it . 
  fanatism is when you just wants to enforce something regardless of any rationale , support or possibilities , when you bend reality to serve your ideology . 
  it works for many different ideologies and beliefs but in this case it 's internationalist utopy . 
  there 's no european people , no nation or demos , thus no democracy and assembly like ep is just useless and expensive but not representative body . 
  i support union , not a federation . 
  i know this kind of narration and i do n't even want to judge these theories .
