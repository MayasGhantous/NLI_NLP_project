  if this kind of arrogant attitude will remain in brussels and berlin then i 'm afraid eu ( not europe ) will loose a lot of weight . 
  btw . 
  how 's marine polling after british referendum ? 
  i totally disagree with him and once again i warn to not do any desperate moves in actually unpopular centralist direction . 
  the data he presented means nothing , it 's like asking people if they wants just more actions on this or the other issue and of course they agree if they thinks that 's a problem which has to be solved , not necessary by eu which is not going to do it without national govs anyway . 
  your gov and president were asked afaik . 
  that 's how representative democracy works . 
  oh , and you were asked about the eu constitution but answerted incorrectly , you evil people you . 
  how much that was they proposed ? 
  250.000 $ for each ? 
  insolent hungary , thinking they can actually vote or decide anything , fascists !, 
  very useful and interesting . 
  if you 're interested , here 's a video recording from 1937 warsaw about [ election of a gypsy king ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6kiaotr9es ) . 
   clergy like which ? 
  anticlericalism is far more popular than antisemitism . 
  the `` antisemites '' are mostly , like i 've said , people believing in some crazy theories , but really i 'm not sure if there 're more of these who believe in `` jewish occupation '' than these who talk about `` vatican occupation '' . 
  lithuanian linked ? 
  antisemitism was not `` common '' , there lived about 3 million jews in about 30 million poland , compare that to half a million in 60 million germany and their relation to the jews . 
  should i give you examples from lithuania or ukraine , like this pogrom which has nothing to do with polish residents of lw\u00f3w ? 
  the etchnic and religious tensions grew with beginning of nationalism , creation of modern national identity and opposition to germanisation , russyfication and other opressive policies aimed at destruction of our identity . 
  that 's not an issue anymore . 
  actually not even antisemitism is as there 're no jews and the `` hate '' is more about typical stereotypes and conspiracy theories believed by a little margin of people anyway . 
  the problem is more with muslims and dark skinned people , not exacly black , there 's a serious paranoya about islam , arabs , terrorism and their uneacceptable behaviour . 
  people are scared even if there 's no serious reason . 
  maybe for a one century , exactly with russian `` pale of settlement '' and their nice attitude . 
  in every multietchnic society there 're conflicts with etchnic , religious or social background . 
  poland was still far more welcoming to the jews than ** every ** other country in europe from where jews were kicked out at some point of time , not to mention other groups , like protestants from france which were given few hours to pack things and go ... 
  same goes for these made up accusations . 
  first you post a one sentence and then the rest in edit , nice try ... 
  which ones are the `` really bad '' , you mean a song of gintrowski or mentioning the etchnic background of some leftist journalists ? 
  poor people , especially these atheists and gays , so much hate , so brave martyrdom ... 
  this is most of all a list of stupidity , non issues and non arguments , wild stories and just bullshit . 
  not even a bit of `` hate '' . 
  why do n't we talk about the leftist newsweek which `` accused '' duda during campaign that his father in law is a jew ? 
  this is more or less the same `` antisemitism '' which you 're accusing rm of ... and there 's more of that stuff which is completely irrelevant anyway . 
  do n't be a hypocrite and accuse lis of `` antisemitism '' as well . 
  you must be kidding me , are you seriosuly believing in these stories that pis won elections because of some radio and tv with few thousands viewers ? 
  compare it to the readers and audience of the leftist media which were the same supported with public money and their journalists the same replaced the previous when `` liberals '' took over the `` public '' media ... 
  it 's the same pathologic sutiation and i repeat again that mostly journalists of gp were hired in place of these from gw . 
  nobody denies that and i 've said already what i think about abuse of public money by this and the other gov. 
  yes , i 'm going to ignore such `` crimes '' as complaining about jewish american organsiations and their financial demands or any comment and a word about jews , germans and even atheists ... 
  this is just ridiculous , a catholic radio ca n't talk about atheism becuase they feel `` persecuted '' . 
  same bullshit like `` homophobia '' and everything leads just to censorship of so called `` hate speech '' but only for the chosen ones . 
  that was sarcasm , but thanks for another useless list of empty accusations . 
  do you know if there 're any lists of actual antisemites which run the anti `` zionist '' smear campaign in 1968 and kicked out jews from poland ? 
  except for mentioned deputy of the `` liberal '' party of course . 
   before the 20th century the pogroms in ee were happening when poland was occupied by russians , prussians and austirans ... 
  the `` polish king '' was a russian tzar and they did n't liked neither poles , nor jews . 
  never , not even for a moment in history of independent polish state there was institutionalised antisemitism or anti jewish legislation . 
  since at least xiiic poland was the ** only ** country in europe where jews had any [ protection and rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_kalisz ) . 
   listener calling so that 's the `` antisemite propaganda '' ... and surely you have that conversation recorded , right ? 
   regulary yeah , there was a one conversation some ~ ~ 12 or 20 ~ ~ 14 years ago ( 2002 ) or so , it was recently recalled because min . 
  macierewicz was participating ... no , they do n't accuse `` jewish groups '' and criticising eu is not forbidden yet , no matter if that criticism is reasonable or crazy . 
  they gave them ** back ** the funds that were already given and taken away by po , as i 've said both decissions were clearly political . 
  the same goes for supporting this or the other foundation , the problem is not that just the `` wrong '' one get a grant but the whole system of supporting collegues , party comrades or journalists is , it was equally wrong or even worse when for example [ this foundation ] ( https://iam.pl/en/structure-council-of-the-adam-mickiewicz-institute ) was getting loads of money for `` promoting poland '' with an ugly and expensive [ `` modern art '' ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/36302/pap_tecza_625.jpeg ) . 
  now that 's a bullshit , the public opinion has nothing to do with it and most of journalists in `` public '' tv are from gp , as opposed to protesting journalists from gw that were before , at least those which did n't get gov or ambassador jobs . 
  yes , they are , so ? 
  i do n't mean / u/ajuc personally . 
  read that section , there 's nothing but some controversial publicists criticising the jewish organisations with their financial demands and discussing about aushvitz which indeed was ** also ** a labour camp . 
  this is not any `` antisemitism '' , stupidity at most in the second case . 
  the rest are some empty accuastions , protests or declarations without a referrence to anything that this radio actually did done . 
  if you wants to see ~ ~ antisemitism ~ ~ anti zionism then check russian or iranian gov media or even better , publications of some po members like \u015aledzi\u0144ska - katarasi\u0144ska from 1968 and that 's just a one example of these `` democrates '' . 
  he complained that the gov is sponsoring `` antisemite propaganda '' . 
  would be nice to not accuse every opponent of `` antisemitism '' for no reason other than cynical smear campaign . 
  same goes for `` fascism '' , `` trechery '' and the other loaded words abused by a one or the other party . 
  you mean the compensation for taking back funds from their geothermal investment ? 
  that was a decission of [ warsaw court ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/fundacja-o-rydzyka-odzyskala-miliony-zlotych-za-odwiert,621375.html ) but of course that was a political decission when ministry took it back after elections , as well as it was when they decided to give up the case after another . 
  yeah , the title is kinda strange but that 's bbc and i guess they know english better than i do . 
  yes , i know and i 'm thankful as well . 
  i wish we would develop closer relations with romania too . 
   the money as the main reason it is a reason and a valid point , but not the only and not really the most important . 
  the feeling of stabilisation , security and belonging to the `` better world '' is also a factor , but imo the most important is what eu is really about and should remain ... free trade , exchange of services , work and freedom of movement . 
  this year poland will be a net contributor , just for a year and just because of some technical issues and i do n't see anything `` collpasing '' without these money , the gdp growth will keep its tempo , even is is slowing down a little bit due to other factors . 
  russia is not right next to romania , unless you consider the black sea and it 's not really a danger for us in present situation , but the situation can change here and there . 
  exactly . 
  poland also strongly supported ukraine and georgia , or at least conservatives do but that 's not so easy . 
  the british ? 
  do n't think so ... 
  yeah , as i 've said ... if this continues then every country will get out and if that 's the strategy , to discourage and kick out as many as possible then it seems to work perfectly . 
  no offence but poland has the highest support for eu out of all the member states but people still have some limits and the real problem is with the public support in the west , maybe except for italy . 
  and quite a lot from poland in 1939 . 
  ^ thanks !, 
  no , but that 's not the point here . 
  if the internationalists will keep pushing for their unpopular policies then everybody will get out of this kind of an union and they will stay alone in their ivory tower . 
  so , should i call them , after such journalists a `` reasonable massterrace which does n't use primitive propaganda , at all '' ? 
  neither is every person with national identity a `` nationalist '' but still they 're labelled like that in such pieces . 
  why `` shady '' ? 
  cultural marxism is a legitimate ideology , just like nationalism , why should anyone be shamed for beliefs and opinions when ( at least in theory ) we have democracy and freedom of speech ? 
  my first post was ridiculing typical leftist arrogance , how can i take seriously someone who labels his opinions as `` reasonable '' and gives solutions that `` everybody knows '' that are perfect ? 
  i believe that the `` european '' identity exists in some offices and palaces but not really amongst the people . 
  ... there were many people trying to destroy our identity in history . 
  they failed , we survived , life goes on . 
  there are and they 're set in treaties . 
  the constitution failed in the referendums in france and netherlands , succeded in spain with a small turnout and finally was smuggled as a lisbon treaty . 
  it was a mistake the same as the way it was enforced , it gelped with none of the problems that were before and came with each crisis , none of which was solved and only created more distrust and opposition to eu . 
  interesting , but i disagree that it would be a waste and ca n't really see how the other referendum could be cheaper . 
  personally i 'm in favour of more direct democracy with more decentralised union and state , a decission of this importance should have a strong democratic mandate . 
  yes comrade , the central planned and nationalised economy was so superior that we 've had to be tricked into selling that outdared and ineffective crap for peanuts ... 
  i know that but still both in slovakia and czech rep. president is mostly ceremonial figure , in hungary they 're chosen by the parliament and in poland we have a bit mixed and confusing system with some powers shared by the president and goverment . 
  first i 'd like to know where guardian gets its ideas from .
