  yes , i remember that pressure and i did n't like that at all , especially forcing ireland to repeat referendum . 
  our president said that he 'll sign that only after irish people decide , instead of making referendum here , but finally was forced the same . 
  do n't think that there 's any anti american party in here but pis currently is keeping equal distance to both berlin and washington , which is also quite unhappy about our internal politics . 
  as for vaclav klaus , i know just what he was doing with the lisbon treaty then and i 'd not say that he 's a `` moron '' , for sure i 'd prefere him than zeman but this is not my choice . 
  yeah , like i 've said it 's that when you oppose something or dare to have different opinion on some issue then you 're becoming an `` eurosceptic '' suddently . 
  apparently every non federalist politician is `` eurosceptic '' for leftusts . 
  pis was the same , always pro eu , campaigned in favour of accession referendum , negotiated lisbon treaty ( then the british were indeed allies but that was labour party ) and signed it , same as vaclav klaus which was also criticising that . 
  btw . 
  fico seems to disagree with merkel on redistribution of ~ ~ illegall immigrants ~ ~ refugees and if i 'm not wrong also on carbon reduction and russian sanctions . 
  no , but wealthier than spain or portugal for example . 
  not exactly sure about eastern germany but i can bet the difference was not that drastic and bohemia was much more developed than austria , it was the most industrialised and most educated part of austria-hungary . 
  which were already developed . 
  i do n't want to speculate and definetly not to support any dictatorship , even if they were quite soft ( especially salazar ) , i just wanted to say that you was wrong and it 's just a fact that both spain and portugal developed at that time from a level even below eastern europe . 
  ... except that during these ( soft compared to communism ) dictatorships they actually developed greatly . 
  before the civil war spain was poorer than poland . 
  germany preferes turks and recent `` refugees '' , they were the last eu member state to alow exachange of services and work with the new member states that joined in 2004 . 
  ok , so how should i call these people if you 're considering every of these labels as offensive ? 
  i belive there 're some cosmopolites or internationalists amongst the people but there 's few of them and plenty in the establishment of eu and many goverments . 
   conspiracy very funny but this is no secret and that 's what the article is about , pushing back `` nationalism '' , no idea why are you pretending that there 's no such policy or ideology promoted , as if that would be something shameful . 
  then you complain that i `` disrespect '' something that 's supposed to be non existing `` conspiracy '' . 
   you get mad do i ? 
  how am i disrespecting the `` european '' identity ? 
  i 'm not demanding or asking for respect for my identity , i just say that ignoring reality is foolish and creating alternative does n't work , is utopist . 
  i live in a legal system , the question is what kind of system that will be . 
  i do n't speak on behalf of anybody , i 'm merely referring to the opinion polls , elections and referendums but anyway the point is that these acual `` nationalists '' are few and just in several countries , what internationalists are complaining about are just regular people , not any politicians or activists . 
  ... it 's not like i have emotional relation to the `` european '' identity , it 's just non existing , artificial and non issue . 
  it 's just another failed internationalist engineering . 
  and still germany was inviting turks and other immigrants , much harder to integrate and incapable to fill the gaps in german employment which are still there . 
  spare me these excuses , whatever was the reason for this kind of `` tolerant '' policies , the influx of illegall immigrants does n't help the image of german establishment and that was my point . 
  i do n't want to fight against the internationalists , but they wants to fight against the `` nationalists '' or rather the common people which dare to have `` old school '' national identity and replace it with artificial , non existing `` european '' identity . 
  this is a very much existing problem , that 's also what the author complains about from his clearly biased position and fails to consider these `` nationalists '' as `` people '' actually with legitimate opinions . 
  he 's still just a single mp , his mandate represents his voters , maybe . 
  crazy opinion , not the fact that he 's talking . 
  i do n't want an union which does n't represent each and every nation 's interests nor seeks a compromise and common ground between them . 
  the national goverments represents the member states , ep do n't . 
  i 'm not going to complain that it 's an eu institution , in opposite to independent pew . 
  anyway it 's the same as with the previous poll , even if more detailed , it 's still unclear how and what kind of eu would be intervening into these issues and in which way . 
  considering the trends , distrust and opposition to eu is growing and the ruling `` elites '' should finally realeise that 's their fault and responsibility . 
  they have to change their attitude and policies if they wants to keep eu alive but instead of that we see more of the same , more internationalist and centralist ideas which would only scare and discourage more people . 
  it 's just irresponsible and counter productive even from the federalist pov . 
  and appointed president of ep by the coalition of `` christian '' democrates , socialists and `` liberals '' . 
  he has actually no authority to introduce any of these ideas , it 's just his opinion . 
  yes , i also dislike these slogans . 
  it 's not that easy , we 've seen how it was with lisbon treaty and that was a major change but the smaller issues are also sometimes enforced or vetoed by some members states . 
  ... you know how statistics and opinion polls are working ? 
  you 've seen that , neither of polled nations wants `` ever closer '' eu , 34 % french is the highest number but still 39 % wants some powerers returned to their national gov. 
  are there even such members ? 
  i thought that every state held such referendums . 
  i 'm afraid that in current situation eu should hold expansion , `` integration '' and maybe even return some powers to the national governments . 
  i do n't see their economies suffering from that and except for britain , which was always quite an odd member , neither of them wants to get out of eu . 
  there 're other countries where `` eurosceptic '' opinions are on the rise and other ~ ~ illegall migrants ~ ~ refugees contributing to these opinions . 
  i do n't say they did it because of some emotional `` reasons '' but i also do n't know why germany did that and now does something else with non european ~ ~ illegall migrants ~ ~ refugees . 
  or maybe it 's just that the results of this poll do n't fit your opinions . 
  anyway , if you wants something more detailed , i guess [ this ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/external/html/eurobarometer-062016/default_en.htm ) can help . 
  you may also look at [ exit and referendum polls ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/frexit-nexit-or-oexit-who-will-be-next-to-leave-the-eu ) in the other eu member states and think about reaction to these internationalist and federalist inventions that we hear about constantly . 
  you 've said that 's not the best idea , i do n't judge that . 
  maybe , but with the furious reaction to `` brexit '' around here i would n't be surprised if that was serious . 
  excuses . 
  pew research center is considered a serious institution , [ here ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/07/euroskepticism-beyond-brexit/ ) read more and check their methodology if you 're quiestioning that . 
  and why do you want to push back the `` nationalism '' ? 
  stop fighting the people , start listening to them . 
   if only rational reasoning was the basis of decision-making , the remaining 27 member states would , in line with their interests , move to strengthen the eu by taking immediate steps toward stabilisation and enhanced integration . 
   everyone is aware of what needs to be done : find a new compromise within the currency union between the stubborn german-led focus on austerity and the mediterranean countries ' need for increased spending to restore growth and boost competitiveness . 
  but europe 's political leaders seem to lack the courage to pursue this . 
  yeah , i just love this kind of groundless , arrogant declarations . 
  * `` shut up pesants , my opinion is the only reasonable !, 
  do as i say !, 
  and he can be replaced in the next elections , very soon . 
  anyway the people do n't want `` ever closer '' union , they wants more power returned to their national goverments . 
   that the people who do n't want it are out [ no , they are still very much in ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2016/06/pm_2016.06.07_brexit-05.png ) . 
   i would love to see a european google ( geugle ? ), 
  so do it . 
  there 's more than enough of central planned economy already in europe , us gov does not control or create companies and maybe that 's also why americans do it and europeans do n't ... 
   and , if the [ european ] commission does not act jointly , then we 'll take the matter into our hands and just solve the problems between governments . 
  he sounds reasonable , but unfortunatelly now it 's not the time for haste and desperate moves . 
  besides , that 's just his personal opinion and he 's just a finance minister , that 's not the official policy of the german gov. 
   heavily xenophobic uk i know that everyone have to bash uk now but they ( with ireland , sweden and norway ) actually were the first to open work market for new eu member states in 2004 . 
  germany was the last , waiting until the last possible moment . 
  no , it will not be easier without a major european state that was a net contributor . 
  [ absolutelly not ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2016/06/pm_2016.06.07_brexit-05.png ) . 
  the national goverments , in opposite to martin are legitimate representatives of people . 
  you was n't certain what 's utopist so i 've answered . 
  if you wants explanation and arguments you could just ask for that . 
  i understand what you wants to construct , the problem is that 's utopist and just do n't exist . 
  there 's no europan nation or demos and you ca n't just make it up by some social engineering or propaganda , the people [ do n't want `` ever closer '' union ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2016/06/pm_2016.06.07_brexit-05.png ) and i 'm sure they 'd just oppose a single , central gov. 
  not even the ep has any strong legitimacy , elections have terribly low turnout and people do n't feel represented by these parties or factions . 
  it 's actually useless institution , expensive and powerles , it 's probably the only parliament without actual legislative power . 
  i see , thanks for information because i know very little about yout domestic politics . 
  i do n't mean that some pipeline is or is not a bad idea , i mean that schroeder got a job in it and serves de facto the russian gov , it 's clearly a price they paid for nordstream and in my opinion that 's clearly corruption . 
  maybe i should n't take it personally but i felt like that was the op 's intention . 
  it does n't matter if you like the idea of democracy , that 's the way it is and you should learn to live with it . 
  sure , judging that i 'm not really surprised that he failed at school . 
  that 's wiki , but i 've got a downvote for that ... stay classy / r/europe , i love you . 
  no , it does n't mean that especially when a retard can become a top official in the whole eu . 
  i was hoping for iceland vs poland but that 's just my nationalist bias . 
  no offence to the others but i 'm cheering for wales now . 
  i 'm absolutelly impressed by iceland . 
   polish immigrants taking our jobs ? 
  that 's really low . 
  internationalism is utopist for me .
