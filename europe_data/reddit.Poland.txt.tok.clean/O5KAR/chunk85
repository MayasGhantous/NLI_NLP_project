  this is not parliamentar or any kind of democracy . 
  you can interpret it in any way you wanrs , some issues are clearly not supported , some are , some countries want this , others wants that . 
   schulz attended the heilig-geist ( holy spirit ) grammar school , a private roman catholic school run by the holy ghost fathers yeah , about that ... and he attented it for 9 years . 
  i do n't care about farage , he 's nobody and never held any responsible office . 
  we have a saying : * `` better is the enemy of good '' * . 
  not sure if fitting but the real question is if that 's an improvement and i say it 's not . 
   for free are writiers working for free ? 
  are the booksellers , publishers and printers working for free ? 
  that would be slavery or communism , which is no difference really ... but fortunatelly nothing 's for free . 
  why do n't you start listening to the people before it 's too late ? 
  instead of that we have more of utopist wet dreams . 
  because for some reason few obsessed people ca n't work with the union as it is or was so they 'll risk its stability , memberships and even its very existence and for what ? 
  to have more power . 
  btw . 
  schulz could n't even finish a middle school ... such is the eu `` elite '' . 
  i do n't even know and never met a retard that could n't pass `` matura '' . 
  ** edit ** : i see the downvotes and i must say that i do n't hate retarded people , i think that martin can be a valuable member of our community and take responsible jobs , as a coffee kid for example . 
  ukraine and moldova were poor and corripted some time before the pro eu goverments were established , not to mention that the ukrainin president was a minister in the previous govs. . . 
  yes , sweden and norway are considered , the contest will be open and connected with the order for cruise missiles for the submarines ( for about 2bln $ ) . 
  i doubt if germany can provide these . 
  the outcry is pretty big and i do n't know if reactions could be any different as nobody really takes their propaganda and excuses seriously anyway . 
  neither i consider russia suicidal , it can only become dangerous when gets unstable with some political crisis or typical for them palace coup . 
  we 've neglected not just our defences but international relations , prestige and influence , russia was given a free hand and its policies tolarated for too long , same as turkey . 
  eirope is just too soft and ineffective when dealing with some strong neighbours . 
  and why former ssrs ( baltic states ) should not be allowed to have sovereign foreign politics and join whichever alliances or organusation they can and wants to ? 
  if you mean nordstream then nobody calls it a `` provocation '' . 
  i brought the so called `` refugees '' because this kind of unpopular and insane policies angers the people , it 's not about a pack of `` nationalists '' which are in every country but the commomn people which turns against the `` elites '' when they ignore their issues and pretend to be `` empathic '' to the others . 
  sorry , be pragmatic , the economic cost of sanctions is a serious argument , you just have to have better if you wants to convince people , you ca n't ignore reality and insult your opponents forever . 
  i call that `` idiotic '' when nonoe else but a foreign minister openly criticise the exercises of his own military alliance and was not criticising russia and belarus for theirs , especially `` snap '' drills which are closed to the foreign observers . 
  every country can do it and every military can be interpreted as threatening . 
  the problem is that we neglected our defences for years when moscow was modernizing and developing its own . 
  another `` provocative '' headline ... horrors !, 
  they linked a wrong article obviously but i was n't expecting such a reaction in post brexit / r/europe anyway , if not the censorship i 'd rather link sputnik or rt. 
  it 's not just about a `` threat '' , but the promised `` answer '' and that 's why it 's called a `` provocation '' . 
  you mean to `` intervene '' by sanctions for russia and credits for ukraine ? 
  like russia cares about international law ... that would harm their propaganda most of all . 
  i doubt that 's the case . 
  crimea is about military bases , nationalism and all of the propaganda around it is just for the people , separatism in georgia is nothing new ( in opposite to ukraine ) and in both cases it 's used to hold nato . 
  basicly russia accepted the fact of loosing both of these countries and tries to reduce the losses , if they ca n't have these states , then nobody can . 
  the russian bear is getting old and its circus smaller . 
  that 's what kremlin owned sputnik sugessts , you can find it at the bottom of their article . 
  i 'm arguing or actually quoting that `` building up military capabilities '' seems to be a problem for russia . 
   these actions by western colleagues tend to undermine strategic stability in europe and force us to take a retaliatory measures , primarily in the western strategic direction . 
  how can i interpret it in any other way that they consider our `` military capabilities '' as a provocation that has to be answered ( i wonder in which way ) . 
  are you sugessting that britain would defend ukraine ? 
  that whole costume party in crimea and proxy war in donbas is not very convincing , everybody knows who 's behind it anyway . 
  it is , this deal is just a part of `` building up military capabilities '' and that 's what russia criticise in general , of course when these are the other 's capabilities . 
  he also said about `` nato countries '' , which does n't mean the whole alliance , just these coutries . 
  it 's obviously a mistake . 
  and why a nuclear power such as russia has to hide when invading neutral countries ? 
  ... google that title , i do n't want to accuse you of anything but you 're clearly mistaken . 
  no idea which article was you reading , but it was n't * `` germany , poland make ` historically unique ' deal to combine submarine fleets '' * because there 's that quote from shoigu . 
  yes , i 'm not sure if that was you who pointed that out some time ago . 
  it was discussed , supported and opposed as every us action anyway , that was not some war by proxies ( or `` hybrid '' war as it 's called now ) and nobody was pretending that some unknown pilots bought their aircrafts and uniforms at some hardware store ... 
  ... read the article of sputnik , if any article is `` lying '' it 's that one which is also said here that was the source . 
  if you have something better then i 'd really like to see it . 
  used tanks , costing maintnance , being replaced by newer models and if you look at the other contracts it 's not really uncommon . 
  anyway it 's not like poland `` stole '' it or forced germany to sell them at this price and as for subs they will be rather ordered from sweden or norway afaik . 
  i guess that sputnik is censored on this sub as well as many other media ( which is stupid imo ) but the article `` germany , poland make ` historically unique ' deal to combine submarine fleets '' clearly quotes these words of shoigu . 
  of course the russian gov criticise ** every ** nato activity and that includes this agreement . 
  which `` academics '' ? 
  this is the narration created and repeated by kremlin over and over again but the reality is that moscow does n't control eastern europe anymore , these states are free to choose whichever alliance they wants and invasions of neutral neighbours clearly proves that it was necessary . 
  ca n't see relation between kosovo and ukraine , is that some `` revange '' on ukrainians for what americans did 6 years before ? 
  that does n't sound serious ... thet 're actually retreating from georgia and ukraine , desperatelly scorching the land and keeping it as a buffer with instability and border disputes . 
  lets be honest , criticism of kremlin is viewed as `` trechery '' by russians , they takes its side not just because it 's the right side , even when it 's wrong it 's just `` their '' side and we 're the `` enemies '' . 
  there 's also no opposition , no alternative to the ruling party and its politics but there is and quite a lot of choice and criticism of the establishment in the `` west '' , their gov media like rt and sputnik are clearly adressed to the foreign public . 
  i do n't like censorship , we should challange the russians in this information war instead of hiding and escaping . 
  everybody cares and everybody was and is discussing that exactly because that 's usa and not russia which does whatever it wants without consulting anybody . 
  read the [ original source ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2364203.stm ) , russia and france opposed the `` language '' and the latter one wanted to propose an alternative resolution but still they voted down the one proposed by usa while china abstained . 
  how is russian invsasion of ukraine , which is the reason for sanctions , related to us `` imperialism '' ? 
  what intervention ? 
  this is an agreement between german and polish submarine fleets to establish a single command , what is wrong about it ? 
  o really ? 
  point out at least a one `` lie '' in my comment . 
  ... in the usual sense that polish taxpayers pay for 100 % of our military hardware , like german leopard 2a5 tanks ( 203 million $ ) and upgrade of 2a4 ( 605 million $ ) . 
   if nato can undermine russias nuclear retaliation capabilities it ca n't . 
   russians will do the same do what ? 
  if you mean they 'll not discuss with us then you 're quite late because they were n't consulting anybody about modernization of their nuclear arsenal , deployment of ballistic missiles at our borders or actually anything . 
  usa and nato almost every of its actions consulted in un , where even russia aprooved invasions of iraq for example , just to complain about it later . 
  yes but the problem is not just the russian public opinion , which does n't really matter for kremlin as it ca n't influence its politics . 
  the problem is that there 's growing support for putin in europe and even usa , many people just listen to this kind of narration and believe that it 's russia which is reacting to nato actions , not the opposite way . 
  not sure about baltics , if so then i condemn it and the same goes for arresting absolutelly unimportant piskorski but we do n't censor or prevent pro russian or clearly kremlin made media and organisations . 
  i do n't care what people say and it 's not `` whataboutism '' because it 's just not a comparable situation . 
  your russophobic comment is a provocation . 
   `` the military-political situation along [ russia 's ] western borders remains unstable . 
  the united states and other nato members continue to build up military capabilities , primarily in countries neighboring russia , '' russian defense minister sergei shoigu so , building up `` military capabilities '' is a provocation , of course only when we do it . 
  typical hypocrite barking of russia , probably even they know how ridiculously that sounds but they have to nail it to the people . 
  edit : this is mostly just a simbolic move but poland wants to buy at least three submarines until 2020 for about 1.5 bln $ and replace that old junk we have at now . 
  can they ? 
  actually , why so many czechs are against eu membership , is there some party or media which wants secession ? 
  i know little about sobotka but the previous czech president klaus seemed much more reasonable and most of all sober , no idea how czechs could elect someone like zeman ... 
  do n't think so . 
  i guess you mean the sanctions imposed on crimea . 
  i do n't think that russian organisations or gov owned media are forbidden in europe . 
   it was unclear what president putin was referring to when he spoke of troops 1500 kilometres from the finnish border . 
  russia maintains military bases significantly closer to the border near st. petersburg , at alakurtti and in murmansk . 
  oh it 's very clear that he 's just lying . 
  besides these bases , there were many [ exercises ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/russian_troops_near_finnish_border_placed_on_combat_readiness/7871824 ) right next to the border of finland . 
  if i recall correctly there 's barely 34 % support to leave eu in czech rep , but only 49 % support to stay . 
  it 's still quite a lot , in poland that 's barely 13 % for leaving and 81 % in favour of staying .
