  the same wanted russia but that 's not my point . 
  getting personal benefits from political position is what i 'm calling corruption and that 's exactly what schroeder did . 
  you 're the same missing my point . 
  i 'm not judging economic aspect of nord stream here , only that the former german chancellor signed a deal with russia right before retired and then got a ceo job in the russian state corporation that constructs and operates it . 
  you do n't see anything wrong here ? 
  what kind of transit fees ? 
  we do n't get a penny even from oil pipeline `` druzhba '' . 
  what would you say if merkel will get a job from russian gov or some oligarch ? 
  poland is `` pulling '' its lng hub and pipeline to norway and i 'm asking again ... what kind of transit fees are you talking about ? 
  that 's positive for schroeder 's pocket first of all . 
  if you do n't see how 's that unethical and suspicious then really i ca n't help . 
  the point is , iraq has nothing to do with russia , the same as afghanistan , lybia or any other war and intervention that russia complains about . 
  but before that it 's supporting resolutions in un security council like a true hypocrite . 
  building nord stream obviously , for what he was rewarded with a top position in that russian state corporation . 
  russia supported invasion of iraq in un security council and resolution 1441 . 
  i should look it up because i 've never seen it , but i 'm not following him . 
  far left suffered horrors of far left regime ? 
  that 's absurd . 
  i 'd say that korwin is quite pro russian , no idea how to label `` zmiana '' except they 're unimportant group of clowns , clearly paid by russia . 
  as for the nationalists , they seem to be more anti ukrainian and they often repeat russian propaganda . 
  the problem is not with the people that are `` supported '' by putin or kim , but with the ones that return favours . 
  the best example would be former german chancellor schroeder , but also look at what are doing your leaders on retirement ... 
  the former president of poland aleksander kwa\u015bniewski , wildly supported by the leftist media , post communist and drunker used to be `` advisor '' to comrade nazarbayev and then an `` advisor '' to [ bursima holdings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burisma_holdings ) owned by some ukrainian oligarch connected to yanukovych . 
   ukip are they really russian leaning ? 
  i see , it seems i was mistaken . 
  sorry for that . 
   the polish foreign ministry told voa that poland has not issued visas for north korean workers after the north conducted its fourth nuclear test in january . 
  they were , as well as in qatar , dubai and several other places . 
  i remember that and i knew about a long time before from polish media . 
  despite excitement of several people , this is not reaction to vice reporting . 
  really ? 
  i 'm afraid that we understand each other but we disagree on reasons behind kremlin politics towards neighbours . 
  that 's not what i 'm sugessting , but konowing the history i would n't be surprised , anyway my point is that was just another provocation , a threat . 
  so you say it never happened ? 
  right ... poland was not exercising offensive actions against belarus , actually until recently there were few and little drills in here . 
  neither eu , nor nato were reacting to russian threats , provocations and muscle flexing . 
  the same as in case of lithuania , this situation changed after invasion of ukraine but what would be the reason to excercise it in 2009 ? 
  again , we 're talking about 2009 . 
  no idea what was that `` answer '' for even if we assume that the un ( not nato ) operation in lybia was somehow related to poland in 2011 . 
  you 're just making up theories and excuses . 
  why would we do that ? 
  the few belarussians in eastern poland are our citizens , they do n't complain and nobody wants to antagonize them , nor to insult and provoke belarus or any other neighbour . 
  also , 2009 was not that recent . 
  these are strategic military targets , not civillians . 
  with these exercises your gov expressed its relation to the polish minority , considered as aliens , enemies and possible target for military . 
  that 's not funny . 
   according to nikiforov , the russian federation agreed with the brics ( brazil , russia , india , china and south africa ) countries to join efforts to sailfish os development in response to the total domination of us software , i.e. 
  microsoft windows , google 's android and apple 's ios that fully control most of the world 's it-market . 
  first of all , it does not say anything specyfic , nothing official and secondly ... it does not mean that everybody will be using russian os but rather that each of these countries desperatelly tries to compete against the dominant american corporations . 
  you thinks that china or india do n't do it already ? 
  ~ ~ afaik [ it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rostec ) as every of mentioned above projects a gov idea and ownership . ~ ~, 
   market of russia and other brics nations wow , are n't you a * bit * too optimistic ? 
  somehow i do n't see russia competing against china and india , not even against south korea . 
  no idea really and i do n't know if state corporations should produce phones just for the sake of having `` your '' phone and not profit for which you need to compete without state subsidy . 
  same here , very few people buy local electronics , maybe except for [ goclever ] ( http://www.goclever.com/uk/ ) with 5 % of market share in 2015 ( 8 % in 2014 ) . 
  it 's mostly assembled with the same chinesse components that everybody use anyway , but these are some private companies , not the gov or some ministry ... 
  no idea really and i do n't care anyway . 
  that 's some beauty contest , or what ? 
  one anonymous official and his theories are far less reliable source than the official opinion of public french authorities . 
  all i see in here is creative pr from french authorities and still no idea why would ukraine made it all up . 
  that 's quite a far fetched conspiracy theory , even as for you . 
   kiev may have orchestrated the incident to serve its own interests i see french are becoming paranoid . 
  besides , what interests and how could it serve ? 
  i was asking about scenario of `` zapad '' 2009 exercise . 
  how would you feel if poland and nato will practice fight against belarussian minority ? 
  ... you 're hopeles , but i 'm going to ask again . 
  ** when nato invaded ukraine ? 
  that 's nice , but what do you think about exercising suppresion of a polish uprising in belarus ? 
  culture + administration + technology + science + religion ... 
  politics is also a matter of culture and however that was corrupted in xviiic , abused and used against pesants , it was working well for few centuries before . 
  no , but you say that lithuania became dependant on poland and weaker because of that , i say it was the opposite way and lithuania benefited from that relation greatly . 
  it was not just polish , but latin and more common , catholic and european culture . 
  almost every document or literature was written in latin then , just in renassaince developed `` fasion '' for national language and a major cultural boom which came also to lithuania , with polish language . 
  i 've heard there 's a one in latvia . 
   abrams came dead last you sure ? 
  you became dependant on our help against teutons and moscow , your elites ( the `` pagans '' , not orthodox ) and people were baptised in catholic rite , peacefully . 
  nobility was `` adopted '' to the polish coats of arms , you adopted our administration with voivodeships and local parliaments ( sejmiki ) ... did i missed something ? 
  now , i 'd say that union with lithuania made poland weaker , concentrated on some exotic moscow or turkey and crimea , drained our resources and changed social relations because the richest , most powerful and dangerous , corrupted magnates lived in ukraine ( some things never change ) which was just a pain in the ass ... 
  not exactly , alexander was left as a `` magnus dux '' and w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii became `` dux supremus '' in [ treaty of ostr\u00f3w ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostr%c3%b3w_agreement ) . 
  oh and after death of witold the grand duchy would pass to jagie\u0142\u0142o or his sucessors . 
  lithuanians argue that `` applicare '' does not mean annexation exactly , hard to say what does it mean in that context . 
  besdies , the future unions settled that in a different way . 
  it was a great deal for jagie\u0142\u0142o . 
  are you sugessting that union made it weaker ? 
  lithuania alone would not survive fight against teutons and moscow for a long time , besides the elites would get assimilated anyway as they were already marrying ruthenian women and considering orthodox baptism . 
  the biggest since cold war drills `` vostok 2014 '' involved 100 - 120.000 troops . 
  meanwhile crimea was taken over by the armed `` tourists '' . 
  depends which , i 've heard about international observers attending `` zapad '' . 
  not enough you evil homophobe , give more `` rights '' , more !, 
  believe me , i 've seen quite a bit of interesting conversations on democracy now !, 
  or info wars . 
  for me it 's nothing special , it 's actually very good that there 's opposition , various opinions and parties competing against each other , even these which are de facto useful ... for the foreign regimes . 
  in russia or china you 'd be branded a `` traitor '' and harrased for criticizing gov. 
  rt is just playing some rebel alternative to the `` main stream '' media , which is quite laughtable as for a tv founded and directly sponsored by the russian gov. 
  you obviously missed the news , including the one above . 
  look at the whole study , the important question is [ this one ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2015/06/russia-ukraine-report-27.png ) . 
  no , i did noticed just a show called presidential campaign , [ opinion polls ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/1-nato-public-opinion-wary-of-russia-leary-of-action-on-ukraine/ ) tells me something else than you . 
  i 'd sooner see germany as our enemy than usa but lets get back to reality and forget the non existing federal army . 
  as for now there 's nato , most of which members are european and eu countries , but somehow i do n't see serious commitment from france or germany and i 'd not be surprised if they 'd just make some deals with russia over our heads or even against our interests . 
  doubt so , it 's also another dangerous federalist wet dream and i 'm afraid that this military could be abused .
