  most of all its command would be the same as eu itself , incompetent and driven by irrational ideologic `` reasons '' like parity or quotas of positions for each member state . 
  it works because america is the world 's most powerful country , poland by far is not . 
  also we spoke about a single united army . 
  there was no way that poland would give pomerelia to germany . 
  britain was more afraid of balance of power on the continent and relative power of france . 
  whatever the losses would germany and russia suffer , they would get along anyway and if you 're sugessting to keep pre war status quo to not upset them , then forget about it . 
  appeasment was a mistake and i told you when it ended , but somehow you failed to notice that . 
  also there was a referendum in austria , but germany invaded before the results were published . 
  mind that we 're talking about mad , sadistic people with `` racial '' superiority complex . 
  what else would they say ? 
  for sure not that they will stop exercising and provoking because `` trust '' is so dear to them . 
   everyone was given the right to self determination expect the central powers after the great war this comment makes no sense here , but anyway you 're wrong . 
  there were referendums in masuria and upper silesia , there was n't any in pomerelia or greater poland and especially not in german puppet `` kingdom of poland '' because everywhere there was vast polish majority . 
  there were also rebels against germany , their forces were demilitarised and ordered to retreat . 
  you also forgot that thanks to your appeasment germans got everything they wanted until they broke munuch treaty , took over the rest of czechia and literally appointed dictator of slovak puppet state . 
  that 's history . 
  it was cold war and russia was doing exactly the same , both were aiding some competing factions all around the world , not just in middle and south america . 
  which country of latin america would be a `` spere of influence '' of usa now ? 
  ok , trust in whatever you wants , the russian threats and scenarios of exercises are not the most important thing here , they 're clearly directed against poland and nato which is finally answering to these and still in quite a moderate way . 
  russia is targetting poland anyway since at least its accession to nato , i 'm sure that people know it very well especially if russia constantly thretens the neutral countries like sweden and finnland . 
  that 's not going to work , sorry but still there would be a drastic disproportion of forces , like between usa and the rest of nato . 
  a single military would be terribly stretched if it would defend everything and the biggest country would need to contribute most while getting nothing in return except for conflicts in command , fear and complaints about power abuse . 
  sorry , there were international observers there and i assure you that we 're spying on these countries , it 's not just 2009 and not only telegraph . 
  you thinks we do n't have services or media that follows the events from neighboring countries ? 
  anyway that thing about polish minority in belarus is enough of a provocation and these massive drills should be adressed by nato a long time ago , if they can do it then i see no way how our drills can be criticised . 
  of course russia will whine but we should just ignore it . 
  we have eu and nato where we rely mostly on america since we 're unable to deter russia alone . 
  intermarium or any alliance of this kind would end up with poland defending eastern europe and it 's just not able to do so since at least xviiic . 
   preemptive strike on russian nuclear facilities not with their mirvs and they could just develop anti rockets or adapt their sams . 
   poor denmark !, 
  they 've said the same about finnland and sweden . 
  they also exercise nuclear strikes on warsaw on their drills with belarus . 
  finally . 
  since years russia and belarus have massive exercises `` zapad '' in which they simulate nuclear attacks on warsaw or supression of polish minority . 
  pity that it took invasion of ukraine for nato to wake up . 
  -0.1 % sad , but according to estimates . 
  the previous quarter was the best in eight years . 
  not sure , googling shows a lot of american complaining and some sources say it 's not even possible to rank them because only top three ( germany , denmark , poland ) were announced . 
  you 're messing everything up . 
  so what if i 'm laughting at that american guy , it 's quite laughtable when the other guys appearing on that `` show '' talks about some neonazi neocons trying to take over the world ... how not to laught at these people ? 
  the story you 've made up ( or rather repeated ) is the one about victoria nuland constructing the uktainian gov with american ambassador . 
  and no , my timeline is not mixed up , yanukovych signed a deal with opposition , dismissed gov of azarov and appointed yatsenyuk while you 've said that was ** after ** yanukovych fled the country , not to mention refusing return to the previous constitution ( before he made his own ) despite that was a point of agreement . 
   address any of my points without insults and revisionist history ... when did i insulted you ? 
  and what `` revisionist history '' ? 
  yatsenyuk was appointed by yanukovych and you was just wrong . 
  open some map and see where 's europe , russia and america . 
  europe should ** not ** be idle and ignore agressive , militartistic regime at its borders when its invading couuntries and annexing their parts right under our nose . 
  all of the wars and military conflicts in post wwii europe involved soviet union or russia , except for a war in yugoslavia and separatism in kosovo , basque country or northern ireland . 
  so , forgive my `` ignorance '' but i will repeat my question . 
  when nato invaded ukraine ? 
  really ? 
  actually i 'm surprised that any american would visit that ridiculous anti `` western '' propaganda machine . 
  forgive me if i offended that guy but someone who talks this kind of bullshit with some crazy conspiracy nuts seems to be equally unimportant and insane . 
  that means exactly that , i 'm not going to make up a whole story based on a one intercepted phone call and not very surprising at that . 
  i do n't say you 're russian but for some strange reason you listen to their gov owned mass media and now you links something unrelated which does not answer how `` yats '' ( so funny ) got his office . 
  you should [ read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agreement_on_settlement_of_political_crisis_in_ukraine ) more if you was n't following the news at that time . 
  no , i 'm not mixing up anything . 
  well , he was also grand duke of lithuania , livonia , prussia , ruthenia , samogitia , courland etc. . . 
  this is actually interesting because i do n't see other than polish ( or dynastic ) coats of arms on our money . 
  not sure from where that one is , but [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/sobieski_crown.png/800px-sobieski_crown.png ) is a one with sobieski coat of arms from a church that he sponsored in gda\u0144sk . 
  the shield motif is [ janina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janina_coat_of_arms ) , a coat of arms of his family . 
  [ johannes hevelius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johannes_hevelius ) , famous astronomer from gda\u0144sk named a one [ constellation ] ( http://frombork.art.pl/pl/wp-content/uploads/images/h_g177.jpg ) for sobieski , his sponsor obviously . 
  it 's [ scutum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scutum ) . 
  you must be kidding . 
  ottomans just took over podolia and with their crimean puppets they were pillaging our lands and kidnapping people ( jasyr ) . 
  if not austrians then ottomans would partition poland . 
  would you like ~ ~ milk ~ ~ juice from [ baltona ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsz4ejfeyfi ) ? 
   500 lei 482.84 z\u0142oty and yes , romanian , bulgarian and especially moldovan wines are cheap and tasty . 
  sobieski deserves it more , no dis to srm king jadwiga . 
  they should give him a [ laurel wretch ] ( http://24kurier.pl/media/2374/1-1-5-l.jpg ) . 
  and hussar wings . 
  excuse me , but what kind of fear ? 
  i know that warsaw was rebuilt . 
  sorry , i was posting some pictures but it seems that photobucket is also censored on this sub ... well , you can just google images of warsaw old town and there 's quite a lot of it there . 
   progressive left leads to far-right elaborate . 
  i do n't . 
  the life was much harder then , shorter , less healthy and much more dangerous . 
  they do , but there were some old , regional and even city dialects which were completely lost because of wwii , because of one or another genocide and especially migration , expulsions and population transfers . 
  i think that every language is evolving anyway but there 's something more ... the way these people acted and spoke then , it was a different world , culture and different problems . 
  can you be more specyfic ? 
  do you mean the picture of the old town ? 
  it could be much closer comparation because in here it seems like we replaced ruins of the old town with glass towers and it 's not true . 
  there 's no history of education in europe without catholic church , convents , univerisities and colleges . 
  to be fair , protestants also had their schools and contributed to common education , but protestantism is really unclear to me and not because i 'm catholic ( i 'm not ) , it seems like everybody can make own `` church '' and sell everything as a `` religious '' thing but also these are completely controlled by the monarchs in protestant states . 
  me too , i have some and i know where to find hours and hours of old propaganda and newsreels from all around the world , including dutch [ polygoon ] ( http://www.openbeelden.nl/media/743037/dankdienst_voor_poolse_troepen ) . 
  the old town was reconstructed and praga ( eastern riverside ) was occupied by the soviets when germans slaughtered people on the western side and demolished it . 
  it was not just the fight and bombardment but also a systhematic demolition . 
  already in 1939 considerable part was destroyed , estimated 10 % of the city . 
  then there was made the [ ghetto ] ( http://sharemap.org/public/warsaw_ghetto#!flash ) in the very center with at least 400.000 of jewish warsaw residents and [ razed to the ground ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/warsaw_ghetto_destroyed_by_germans%2c_1945.jpg/1920px-warsaw_ghetto_destroyed_by_germans%2c_1945.jpg ) after uprising . 
  there 're old buildings and as i 've said , reconstructed old town and quite a lot of other areas , but these pictures are just confusing because they show different areas . 
  ok , but it 's not true that there 're no such pictures of warsaw from that time . 
  no , both are facing west , first shows the old town in direction of ghetto and second shows part of city centre in direction of wola . 
  have you asked the french ? 
  two things , [ ruin of st. john 's cathedral ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/ruins_of_st_john_cathedral_warsaw_1945.jpg ) and construction of [ warsaw spire ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/warsaw_spire_february_2016.jpg ) . 
  [ not exactly ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/destroyed_warsaw,_capital_of_poland,_january_1945.jpg ) the same perspective but that 's obviously old town market square and not the present centre with a palace of stalin . 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/silmyauxlhm ) you have a video about reconstruction of the old town , of course it contains some propaganda of the leftist regime but if you do n't know the language then it does n't matter . 
  the last part of the video is in colour and shows the finished work . 
  most of the old town was reconstructed between 1949-53 , then there was cathedral and other churches and royal castle was finished in 1981 . 
  do n't think that we put skyscrapers in the area of old town ... 
  no , completely different .
