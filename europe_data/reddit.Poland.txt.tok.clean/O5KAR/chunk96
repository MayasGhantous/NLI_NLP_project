  first is a frame from animation and it shows the old town . 
  the second is a picture of the present center of the city , completely different place . 
  i mean that there 're no pure doctrines , people and politicians do not follow any ideology to the point from its definition and these can also differ . 
  what you 're talking about is populism and it 's typical for each and every party in democratic system , not just to these labelled as `` populists '' by some mass media . 
  democracy is just about getting majority of votes and as long as the winning people follow their promises then it 's fair , even if that would be a bad policy then people chose it and they will pay the consequneces . 
  do n't think so . 
  these parties and politicians are also changing . 
  would you call cameron a conservative , or merkel a christian democrate ? 
  not even hollande is considered socialist now because the actual leftists are angry as f. . . on his politics . 
  the additional problem which we have in eastern europe is the patologic legacy of a leftist regime , like corruption , but really do n't idealise western europe and especially its politics . 
  do n't get offended , i just heard this kind of combo of cookies and terrible , secret talk from some american which was a very frequent host on rt. 
  yes , i 've listened . 
  people are discussing politics everywhere and talking who 's going to take which position , big deal . 
  you really thinks that the big american conspiracy was made with a one phone call ? 
  not to mention that the gov of yatsenyuk was appointed by yanukovych and voted by parliament , but russians somehow forgets that . 
  does it really matter ? 
  it 's pathetic that kremlin has nothing but intercepted chit chat and cookies to back up its narration . 
  when did i denied the fact that ukraine is corrupted ? 
  or that 's the ideology , like in poland ? 
  the `` fascists '' currently in charge are introducing some massive social , demograpgic and housing programs but they 're not called leftist , usually . 
  and who will command it , in which language ? 
  we have a military alliance and that should be enough . 
  we could have maybe eu police and border guard but also not without local services of each member state . 
  the eu army would be like eu itself , the people in charge will be put there because of their political faction , nationality , gender or anything but competences . 
  * budget leeway `` because it 's france '' . 
  imagine they do it in poland , but these schools are also funded mostly by the state because the leftist regime nationalised them . 
  ususally catholic schools are private and not so cheap , but they 're on a very high level and nobody 's teaching creationism there . 
   originated in the us but are now dotted around the uk why am i not surprised ? 
  well , germany did invited these immigrants , in theory to avoid humanitarian catastrophy but they were going to germany anyway . 
  it 's also clearly a german idea to share immigrants between all the eu member states and people are afraid that 's going to be a permanent mechanism . 
  i do n't know much about the issues of romanian membershiop in schengen , but greece should be kicked out or helped and controlled because driving migrants to the border with macedonia is definetly not the way it should work . 
  hungary should not be bashed , but aided in defence of schengen border , the whole naive and utopic leftist attitude should be just abandoned , but this is unfortunatelly the mainstream euro politics . 
  why does that sound familiar to me ... oh yeah , i 'm also watching kremlin today . 
  pity that there was n't any other mysterious leak , but if some informal chit chat about politics is everything that `` leaked '' to the russian services then that was a really secret `` coup '' . 
  and as for the cookies , they surely were secret weapons of mass destruction ... that 's african level of scummy corruption , typical for former colonies , but it did n't came with biden . 
  you 're naive or blind , but most peobably just hypocrite . 
  i remember that very well , it was n't a long time ago actually , the same biased attention to different demostrations , some juvenile fights over attendance and not a single conservative publicist except for re hired pospieszalski . 
  that 's your chancellor talking . 
  yes , it is but it 's still just an advisor body and / u/lared930 just confused these two . 
   refuse any help with refugees and block every attempt at a sensible solution we 're sending our border guards to hungary because we do n't want these evil magyars to [ treat the immigrants like you treated jews ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11860682/germany-prepares-for-arrival-of-40000-refugees-this-weekend.html ) . 
  taking in every illegall migrant and giving them money for nothing is not the way . 
  we have legal obligations , conventions and rules about asylum and migration . 
  refugees can applie in our embassies and councils , but illegall migrants will be arrested and deported . 
  maybe , but it 's not just a one `` bad guy '' that not just supports the polish gov , but oppose the ec and ep inquiries and accusations . 
  britain ( guess that 's a `` big name '' , or not ? ), 
  and romania are not the members of visegrad group and we 're not supporting each other on many issues , unfortunatelly . 
  i think it 's just disrespectful . 
  yes . 
  the visit was more than that , it was not planned but president visited the site and laid flowers and i remember many positive comments from romanians . 
  that was a `` mini nato '' summit with all of the [ leaders of eastern europe ] ( http://media.wplm.pl/pictures/830x600/path/2015/11/04/800/413/bfe11208b66c441a821bd4085994c1ce.png ) , i guess to discuss a common position for the actual nato summit in warsaw this year . 
  leaning ? 
  it was always controlled by the gov , now you just see how it looks like from the perspective of opposition and all of these leftist journalists which were put in there after death of kaczy\u0144ski and takeover of komorowski as acting president . 
  if remember well that was his first decission , to dismiss the media council , in the middle of their cadention . 
  even wajda was babbling something during elections that they have `` friends '' in tvn and `` that other station '' but they need to take over public media . 
  that drunken clown recently excused france from breaking eu treaties `` because it 's france '' . 
  read that whole article , not just the headline . 
  we recognize and we follow the treaties , like when we 've had to undergo the excessive deficite procedure , because we 're not [ france ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/675779/eu-french-budget-jean-claude-juncker ) . 
  this is not a matter of intenrational treaties and it 's really not clear on which base ec inquires poland and for which reason . 
  do n't be naive , countries have interests even in eu and there 're also groups of interest in ep and ec . 
  this is also how donald got his nice office and why his party was not criticised for exactly the same actions , especially in case of public media it 's just hypocricy because they always were controlled by the gov in poland and every was replacing journalists . 
  still ec is something else and vc is just an advisor body . 
  i just wanted to make it clear that the inquiry was not started by the polish gov. 
  he was fired from tvp , ca n't find info if he was fired from gazeta.pl too . 
   12 % of your budget you do n't know how eu funds works , do you ? 
  also , i 'm very sorry that poland has the biggest population in ee so it 's getting more money than bulgaria . 
  many people see that there 's something wrong happening , they 're called opposition and they 're protesting , but they 're not convincing for the majority and as long as we have democracy ^ ^ tm they 're the sovereign . 
  like it or not , it 's just like it is and poles just do n't like foreign influence on our internal issues like constitution and tribunal . 
   there will be a state propaganda machine remind me since when there ** was n't ** ? 
  public media , just like every state owned company was ** always ** taken over by the ruling party whichever that was . 
   1 leader has come in support you mean david cameron , milos zeman , boguslav sobotka , robert fico , viktor orban or klaus iohannis ? 
  edit : hungary was not investigated , only bashed and insulted . 
  not many poles know about that and sorry to say , but romania is a very rare subject of news or comments . 
  it 's a pity but the worse is this kind of arrogant superiority complex which i 've seen in leftist media ( na temat ) when they were ridiculing the visit of our president in bucharest . 
  this is unfortunatelly more common . 
   started by pis themselves you 're confusing european commision with venice commision . 
  is there any inquiry into the , allegedly threatened freedom of press ? 
  yes , but it 's still irrelevant . 
  what matters is that the medias in poland are extremaly biased and their influence on politics is patologic , anti democratic . 
  really ? 
  can you give me his name ? 
  s/he did not . 
  well , i 'm no expert , but these guys looks really young ( i do n't mind that most of them are black ) and they still looked like a solid team . 
  better , so maybe it 's not that the poles get dislike for russians , but rather for russian politics ? 
  oh , and history , another very nice topic to talk with russians . 
  who said that he 's a politician ? 
  also , do n't make me laught ... the whole lid is completely dependant on support of journalists , exactly opposite is with pis which controls its journalists . 
  the `` liberal '' gov was introducing laws ( like parity or in vitro ) , hired and dismissed ministers when they were `` too catholic '' or feminist `` experts '' and all of that was because of constant campaigns of leftist media . 
   not so vocal oh they were . 
  some journalists , politicians and `` authorities '' such as [ kuczy\u0144ski waldemar ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/1,75968,18508237,apel-obywatela-do-rzadzacych.html ) were quite vocal about that it was a ** good ** idea to appoint more judges by po - zsl . 
   any proofs ? 
  he 's wrong , tvp is not paid from gov money but from taxes . 
  what 's the difference between lis and sakiewicz or kurski ( jaros\u0142aw ) and stankiewicz ? 
  none , except for the sides that they 're working / protesting for or against . 
  they are opposition leaders , not just journalists . 
  do n't know what they were trying to do , especially in defence but this team could beat germany ( because we ** always ** have to get them in a group ) and we have some really good players this time ( including ajax striker , arkadiusz milik ) . 
  i do n't think you sucked , or our team just sucked more . 
   disslike for russians only for these russians which became the same interested in politics , which usually means they 're becoming completely obedient , incapable of criticising gov and believe its propaganda to the point . 
   shitting on the russian people where ? 
  hitler was `` cartoonish '' compared to stalin or mao . 
  there 's also another way , czechoslovakia split peacefully , same as the new yugoslavia ( serbia and montenegro ) .
