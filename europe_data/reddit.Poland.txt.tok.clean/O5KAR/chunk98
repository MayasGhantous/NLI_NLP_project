  doubt so , it 's much more expensive but i guess we 'll be forced anyway . 
  danzig was destroyed , as you can see . 
  we 've build gda\u0144sk . 
  do as you wish but ec should use the same measures for every member state , unless it wants to be marginalised and ignored . 
  somehow we could afford it in [ gda\u0144sk ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/gdansk-destroyed-rebuilt-photography-karol-nienartowicz/ ) , wroc\u0142aw was also terribly destroyed and reconstructed . 
  similar with warsaw but i know many ruins and even quite fine buildings were demolished to make space for some socrealist projects . 
  somehow i doubt that germany was in a worse condition . 
  bravo !, 
  ok , i will change it if that obvious typo is really confusing for anyone . 
  all animals are equal , but ... our constitution says that it 's not allowed to take credits or give finanacial guarantees when public debt exceeds 3/5 of annual gdp . 
  security threshold was at 50 % until the `` liberal '' party moved it to 55 % in 2013 . 
  since 2009 poland was under excessive deficite procedure , for that reason gov rised vat and donald promised that will be just for a year . 
  of course it was a lie , even in 2015 when eu lifted that procedure no taxes were decreased and the `` fascist '' gov is also silent about it . 
  sure , france can destroy its economy , go on a full strike and demolish its cities ... because france !, 
  and foreign minister . 
  in 2016 poland will be [ net contributor ] ( http://www.money.pl/gospodarka/unia-europejska/wiadomosci/artykul/polska-bedzie-platnikiem-netto-w-ue-w-2016-r,220,0,1976796.html ) to eu , but just because of technical issues and just for a one year . 
  do n't worry , soon the eu funds will end and our politicians will start panicking because they ca n't think in longer terms than the next elections . 
  wait ... what about the rules and law ? 
  polan confused !, 
   all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others . 
  you know who, 
   shitty and expensive coal why tree hugers do n't like atom ? 
  why the lefty media were n't complaining that the former minister aleksander grad takes huge cash for doing absolutelly nothing but promising to build a nuclear plant ? 
  now we 're going to import electricity from belarus because even they can manage it ... that 's how we 're getting dependant , but we do n't use gas and oil for production of electricity anyway and it can be hardly replaced by `` renewable energy '' . 
  poland just finished its lng port in \u015awinouj\u015bcie ( right next to szczecin ) and it should cover 1/3 of our demand when will be fully operational . 
  also there 're many high level meetings with iran recently . 
  there was some plan , or at least idea of `` energetic union '' , loudly announced by donald , which was just babbling ... as always . 
  anyway i 've heard that this ec is investigating gazprom for monopolist malpractice , but i doubt if it will ever come to any conclusions . 
   global one world government yeah , nwo ... 
  please , do n't make me laught . 
  russia should build its own abm if it 's such a terrible weapon instead of running its mouth and whine . 
   spellbinder that was a great show . 
  we 've had few years ago a fracking fever , people seriously thought that poland could be not just self suffucuent but even export gas . 
  many [ corporations ] ( https://www.mos.gov.pl/g2/big/2011_12/8c28059015da612c7db1c93c9d294f69.jpg ) were granted concessions for exploring and extracting shale gas ... 
  the last i 've heard about it was that most of them resigned because it 's just not efficient , resources are too cheap now and extraction in poland is too expensive ( also because the `` liberal '' gov and president issues horrible taxes ) . 
  i hope that 's a joke , not a threat . 
  that was [ numerus clausus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/numerus_clausus ) and it was not just about the jews and not only in poland . 
  no need to link me , i know about all of these incidents , the most famous one in kielce was actually prepared by the communist secret police . 
  also there was an atisemitic campaign in 1968 because soviets supported arabs , the people were protesting and even sending aid to israel . 
  anyway this kind of things happened , there were people which were reporting jews to gestapo for money , some were extorting money and some were stealing or killing ... 
  criminals are in every country and especially under such occupation people were often desperate and demoralised , but it was never legal or tolerated under any sovereign polish government . 
  ... imagine that there 're negative ( as well as positive ) stereotypes about every nation and there 're also opinions about goverments and states . 
  what can i think about the jewish people when everything i hear from them are insults , accusations and demands of compensations ? 
  you talk about poland being antisemitic ( still no idea how was that related to my comment ) and i tell you that it 's not so simple . 
  i 've said that antisemitism was everywhere , i do n't say that every country had anti jewish policiy , i say that there were antisemitic people in every one of them . 
  also , at some point of time every country expelled jews ( 1290 in [ england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edict_of_expulsion ) ) or mistreated in some way , in poland at the same time ( 1264 ) jews were granted many [ rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_kalisz ) and welcomed . 
  at least you 've had independent state , not a puppet ruled by the same people which invaded us in 1939 , murdered hundrets of thousands and expelled 1.2 million to the gulag camps . 
  btw . 
  the polish forces on exile also stationed in palestine , first the carpathian rifle brigade which evacuated from syria after france gaved up and then the army of gen. anders which was composed of gulag survivers . 
  there were also many jews in that army and it was ignored that many deserted and stayed in palestine . 
  thanks a lot . 
  i guess that / u/mysterious _ manny was only joking , but in general i 'd be glad if people would point mistakes ( not just linguistic ) and help to learn something instead of just downvoting . 
  yes , you 're probably right , except that germans usually were n't thretening you but moscow is more than enough . 
  communism is leftist no matter if idiots like you are butthurted when i remind them that . 
  ... you have no idea . 
  i was already posting [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/4ksjoz/poland_introduces_nato_lessons_in_schools_ahead/ ) on / r/poland some time ago . 
  these are extra curricular activities prepared by ministry of foreign affairs and ministry of education . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.msz.gov.pl/pl/polityka_zagraniczna/szczyt_nato_2016/lekcje/ ) you can read the official website of foreign ministry and download exact scenarios of these lessons ( if you 'd know polish ) to see that 's not any indoctrination . 
  also , do n't compare a military alliance which was forced on us by a puppet leftist regime and a one that we joined as a sovereign country with democratically elected representatives . 
  edit : forgot about censorship on / r/europe and confused some links . 
  they 're constructing nuclear plant in there . 
  thanks , but it could be better . 
  you 're comparing a mopolist provider of essential resources to some companies operating on free and competetive markets . 
  so now russia will have some competition and already because of oil terminal in gda\u0144sk we could renegotiate prices with rosnieft . 
  also ec is already investigating that case of politicially motivated prices . 
  thanks for advice , but usually it 's too late . 
  ... of course not . 
  sorry , my english is lacking , but i thought that this sentence is correct . 
  if it is n't then still it should be clear who invaded ukraine . 
  you forgot that it 's not the first project of a pipeline to norway , also the previous gov and minister pawlak wanted to extend this contract for additional 30 years and it was just the intervention of ec which stopped him ... fortunatelly and i 'm honestly glad to see it , the leftists and `` liberals '' are not trying to `` normalise '' relations with russia anymore since they invaded ukraine . 
  i would n't be surprised if the next gov will abandon the deal . 
  it was already planned in late 90s and then a post communist gov abandoned it , of course for economic reasons ... 
  the previous `` liberal '' gov was n't able to finish construction of lng port that was initiaited by the `` fascist '' gov when it was in charge previously ... eight years before . 
  so yeah , it can change in 6 years quite a lot . 
  it 's enough that different prices for each country are politicially motivated . 
  i 'm not sure but it would be probably cheaper for poland to import the russian gas from germany , but gazprom would not allow reselling . 
  russia has also a long history of corrupting ep and european politicians , with chancellor schroeder on top of that . 
   personally met not once . 
  i 've seen newsreels and radio broadcasts from radio berlin where he called for a jihad against the allies , in 1941 he organised a nazi [ coup d'etat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_iraqi_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) in iraq . 
  he was creating muslim waffen ss units in bosnia , there were also some azeri waffen ss but i 'm not sure if that was also his job . 
  how 's that related to my comment ? 
  anti semitism was everywhere but only in poland it was never institutionalised and that 's the real difference not just with germany , but with almost every european country . 
  i will never understand why jews are picking on us , you 're reducing centuries of peacefull coexistence to few criminal events and it 's not improving your image ... 
  the founder of '' \u017begota '' , the only underground organisation in europe designated just to aid the jews , [ zofia kossak-szczucka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zofia_kossak-szczucka ) was considered `` antisemite '' before the war . 
  a pre war leader of nationalist and quite antisemite onr [ jan mosdorf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_mosdorf ) was killed in auschvitz for helping jews . 
  these are just two , quite controversial , out of many examples which i can talk about for hours , the point is that some people were and some were n't sympathetic to the jews but all of them tried to survive under brutal occupatiuon . 
  you ca n't expect everybody to risk life , because that was the punishment for helping jews . 
  also you ca n't just dump millions of people under one label to accuse and insult a whole nation . 
  write all of the nationalities with capital letters , not just your own . 
  turkey is not in eastern europe . 
  thanks , edited . 
  recession is negative gdp growth but what is the use of that if it serves only gov propaganda and people have to pay higher taxes ? 
  donald just lied and you 're just making up excuses for him while he was n't even bothered by the `` journalists '' to answer for any of his `` mistakes '' . 
  no , that was aws - uw with pm buzek ( po ) speaker of parliament tusk ( po ) , minister of finances balcerowicz ( ... ) and his coffee boy petru ( . n ) . 
  i do n't say that privatisation was wrong and i think that even if few crooks got filthy rich in this way , that was still necessary and benefitial ... 
  but , i do n't want these people around anymore , they 've done enough . 
  there 're many more positive facts and poles should be proud because that 's their hard work and sacrifice which is exploit by the `` elites '' to show off and pretend that 's because of their brilliant leadership . 
  it was a gift of uncle joe after all . 
  many things are changing very fast in here , see what happened in the [ last two years ] ( http://maciejmargas.com/jak-zmienila-sie-panorama-warszawy-w-ciagu-2-lat/ ) . 
  i was once in berlin also few years ago , it was clearly a post soviet city too , at least partly similar to warsaw .
