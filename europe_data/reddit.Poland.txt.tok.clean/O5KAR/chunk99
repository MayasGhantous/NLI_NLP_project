  as for destruction and recovery , look at [ gda\u0144sk ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/gdansk-destroyed-rebuilt-photography-karol-nienartowicz/ ) , it 's beautyfull but it 's like disneyland , fake . 
  yes , from this point of view it 's covered . 
  it 's not so terrible but that 's a matter of taste i gues . 
  and i 've heard there was no recession , we were a * green island '' ... ok , enough of this bullshit . 
  they just lied , for this or the other reason and you just ca n't accept it . 
  ... working like creating scam with retirement funds in 1997 and taking these money in 2013 , or with the popular privatisation program which was the lifetime `` acheivement '' of lewandowski ? 
  no wonder they have such nice chats with some oligarchs like kulczyk or president of national bank about fixing currency for elections , but these were the `` illegal tapes '' so it does n't matter . 
  responsibile , self proclaimed `` elites '' pfff, 
  lets even assume that 's true , but does it change the fact that they 've lied ? 
  hell no . 
  lowering this tax back , as it was promised could help kopacz , not to mention voting against the migrant quotas even if donald made it a qualified vote . 
  when pis will rise the taxes then i 'll be commenting . 
  i think that the anti polish sentiments were very strong in germany . 
  some slavic countries collaborated and many volunteer units were created from ukrainians , russians and even muslim bosniaks . 
  the interpretation of national socialist german `` racial '' theories was quite flexible . 
   white countries united and controlled by german puppet dictators you was obviously wrong at least in this case . 
  kl auschvitz i was constructed for polish prisoners , jewish came later . 
  there were many ways , in poland when they suspected someone they were ordering to make a sign of cross or just take the pants down and prove that your dick is not circumcised . 
  franco was a puppet of germany ? 
  germans had no need at least for a puppet polish state or gov , every educated or active person was about to be [ executed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligenzaktion ) , even before the war there were prepared [ lists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_tannenberg ) for elimination . 
  according to the `` race '' laws it was forbidden for germans to mix with `` lower races '' , physical contacts were punishable with death ( for the `` lower race '' ) . 
  every major german company and many private people , including farmers used slave labour , about 1.5 million just from poland . 
  at least 400.000 kids considered as `` racially valuable '' were [ kidnapped ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kidnapping_of_children_by_nazi_germany ) and sent to german families , those considered `` racially unworthy '' were executed , sent to extermination camps or for the experiments ... 
  i can continue for hours but i 'm geting angry already so lets say that you 're wrong about intentions of german national socialists and millions of their supporters . 
  yes , i 've noticed there 's something odd about it but die welt is apparently a serious source ( usually ) . 
  you do n't have to race and it 's far less `` suffocating '' than london or paris and many more really big cities . 
  pity , because i love it . 
  sure . 
  bonus picture , [ warsaw 2015 ] ( http://maciejmargas.com/wp-content/uploads/full3.jpg ) . 
  [ warsaw 1945 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/warsaw_ghetto_destroyed_by_germans,_1945.jpg ), 
   new pis legislation it 's not exactly a new idea , actually the separation of these functions in 2010 was the new thing . 
  pis was always against it and just reversed that reform after elections . 
  the point was about lies , not about taxes . 
  glad to hear that . 
  i wonder how it is in the other countries . 
  yeah , i 've noticed that also in poland , i mean the `` normal '' media are acting more and more like tabloids while the real tabloids , except for typical sensations and gossips , can have quite diversed and pluralist opinion sections . 
  so anyway , there is n't really a problem with pro russian `` trolls '' in finnland ? 
   actually increased vat and promised to do it just for a one year because of eu eccesive deficite procedure which finished in 2015 when he was in brussels and his puppet kopacz did nothing of course . 
  i also doubt that the current gov will decrease it , they 're suprisingly silent about it and were n't criticising the `` liberals '' for that ... 
  ok , but how is he popular amongst the people ? 
  is he running in elections or is there some party in which he 's working ? 
  what russians and their propaganda consider newsworthy is something else , they obviously will give space to this kind of people and show them as representants of finnland or some serious political force ... do n't you have some statistics , media watchdogs and monitoring ? 
  it should be possible to say how many people are reading , how many there 're new users and commentators . 
  i guess that your media market is dominated by leftist and `` liberal '' media , as everywhere , but do you have some conservative or `` nationaist '' media that are not so clearly pro russian as you say that mv is ? 
   fascist country that oppresses minorities etc. 
  sounds familiar ... but these are the correct minorities that i 'm hearing about . 
  that mv looks like some crazy nationalist outlet , but ... how serious are these ? 
  how much of audience and traffic they have on forums ? 
  there 're clearly russian medias in poland and some party `` zmiana '' ( its leader was arrested recently but i think that he 's not any spy ) , but nobody really cares about them and they have almost no audience or supporters . 
  there 's also that crazy libertarian or `` showman '' korwin which is quite pro russian or pro autoritarian and just likes the way putin governs , they have few mps in euro parliament and in the last elections they get 4,9 % ( few votes short from threshold ) . 
  no , that was discussed between gorbachev and us secretary of state james baker about unification of germany and advance of nato in there . 
  there was n't even any clear promise to not include new members , but anyway ... 
  i do n't care about some chit chats , what really matters are written agreements . 
  there was no such promise or any kind of a contract , it 's just a bunch of kremlin bolloks . 
  the issue of cuba and whole south america , as well as many countries of africa and asia was a part of cold war and stuggle between both camps , if not us then ussr would control this or the other country . 
  whatever was or is the influence of usa on europe it 's soft , mutually benefitial and most of all it 's our sovereign decision which we can debate , protests and change freely , like it was in case of france for example . 
  the soviet rule was anything but subtle and benefitial . 
  moscow always was at the big boys table , even if it 's poor and weak compared to rising powers like china and india . 
  you really do n't get it ? 
  the whole oligarch `` elites '' of uktaine are the same as russian or in any other post soviet state , with this difference that in rusia they have lots of resources and a one boss to control them . 
  all of the post soviet states ( except for baltics , i wonder why ... ) are poor and corrupted and the oligarchs are just the former communists , it 's all connected to eachother and countrues like belarus for example have economy based on trade and politically motivated preferential contracts . 
  there 're no pro or anti russian oligarchs , there 're just corrupted post communists oligarchs which can be bought by anybody . 
  do n't know , do n't care , internal problem of ukraine and none business of moscow . 
  absolutelly , i was saying the same many times but if you wants to show a bunch of angry football hooligans or neo nazis , you 're going to find them in every single country . 
  are there many pro russian shills and trolls in finnland ? 
  how 's the general situation in social media there ? 
  wow , already downvoted ... 
  i was accused of paid shilling for pis on / r/polska just because i was posting some links and comments criticising or ridiculing leftists and `` liberals '' when they were still in charge . 
  some people just ca n't stand different opinions . 
  i agree they do n't need to pay , there 's too many of volunteering shills all over the net and i mean from both sides but except for leftist portals and newspapers , the dominance of `` right wing '' is very evident . 
  not long ago the polish net was just overrun by the `` korwinists '' despite the pathetic numbers of votes in elections . 
  when the `` liberals '' finally noticed how terribly weak they 're in the net , even weaker than leftists , on a party meeting somone proposed to hire trolls ... lol i 'm quite sure both of them have paid shills , these days they 're called ... journalists , 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/rape_rate_per_100%2c000_-_country_comparison_-_united_nations_2012.png ), 
  yes at least because i do n't want to have millions of angry and hungry ukrainians storming our borders , smuggling guns , drugs and prostitutes . 
  the snap elections were a paty of the deal , but yanukovych refiused to sign it and just fled the country at night . 
  what east ukrainian narrative ? 
  you 're talking about kremlin propaganda i guess and simply russians or `` soviet '' orphans dreaming about collapse of ukraine , it 's annexation or partitions with poland ... whatever , that was the internal politics of ukraine , at least until russia invaded it . 
  so russia can start acting like it wants to have normal relations . 
  the previous gov did more than enough to appease moscow , up until invasion of ukraine , all we get in return were more arrogant insults , provocations and constant embargos which only prepared us for this one . 
  they do n't want to have good relations and make business , then fuck it , we 'll manage without them . 
  you 're making up theories again . 
  stick to the facts . 
  again , more assumprions , theories and even less of reasoning . 
  you do n't get what i 'm talking about and what was the point from the beginning . 
  spare me these kremlin fairy tales , there were no promises , but some chit chat on a party and it 's not kremlin business what kind of foreign politics and military aliance we have . 
  they can fuck off and take care of their own problems , you can cry about `` paranoya '' or some other `` russophobia '' but it 's just in our interest to keep moscow weak and far away . 
  ... yeah and some other countries are our neighbours , so ? 
  if moscow would be able to take care of its puppets then ukraine would n't be the second poorest country in europe and maybe then people would n't rebel . 
  oh for f. . . sake , nobody except you was talking about expansion . 
  understood ? 
  bullshit , already some years ago there was `` orange revolution '' and it failed miserably after a while , it would be the same in this case but putin got impatent and greedy . 
  i do n't care about their interests , we have our own and we have a conflict here obviously . 
  the game changed when their puppet president gave up and appointed opposition gov of yatsenyuk , so he was ordered to flee and the narration of a `` nazi coup '' was made up to discredit the legal ukrainian authorities , its sovereignty and territorial integrity of the whole country . 
  why should we support a hostile and dangerous foreign country instead of eu member states ? 
  just because some bangladesh or russia has no health or work standards it does n't mean that we have to outsource all of the production there and pay them for their arms race so they could threten us . 
  ... so what else is that ? 
  nobody ignores own interests , appeasment is exactly about that , selling out the others in order to secure own interests . 
  ... so because just you thinks that i 'm talking about expansion then i 'm the paranoid one ? 
  wtf are you talking about again ? 
  what russia does about ukraine except of supporting its puppet donbas junta ?
