i expected to get a picture , showing two attractive girls , in memes-language called `` grills '' / s, 
  true . 
  as far as i know , the majorities : * croatia : catholic christians * serbia : orthodox chritstians * bosnia : more muslims than christians ? 
  * albania : full kebab :p ** am i right ? 
  ** always interesting to know such `` random things '', 
  wow nice anti kebab memes :d * kosovo is serbia ( a classic ) * turkey , is it europe ? 
  haha :-), 
  we all know , but the memers on r/polandball are too stronk :p, 
  i laugh , how memes on the internet might bring kids/people really to think that we can not into space : - /, 
  * meanwhile somewhere in the usa : * `` where was this country again , that 's called europe ? 
  wow we are behind germany in potatoes : - / xd, 
  to the question `` why do poles hate us '' the answer is clear : because of the ** most common sterotype against romanians : romanians = gypsies ** if you ask , why this sterotype really exist , do n't know , but if you go to smaller towns , you will meet alot of these people that want to trick you , watch your future for you , sell a flower :p . if you ask these people : `` where are you from ? '', 
  99 % say either from romania or bulgaria : - /, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i 'm talking about poland not france, 
  we fought the longest vs germans and russians in ww2 , how can we be weak ? 
  hahahahaha, 
  wow did n't expect from sweden to have such a high unemployment rate :p, 
  what ? 
  did you even read the wikipedia article that the guy over you posted ? 
  do you understand english ? 
  so why do you started even to argue with me if it 's written down there !, 
  if you do n't understand it , use a translator instead of writing fucking bs like `` ignorance in your comment is straggering '' for me polak = polish person . 
  same as i call my german friend a deutscher , i do n't think he will cry in a corner after that !, 
  i do n't think you are right , polak for me means `` polish person '' how the official definition is like . 
  there is nothing i would feel insulted !, 
  what ? 
  xddd, 
  '' it is an anglicisation of the polish language word polak , which means a polish male or a person of polish nationality '' ok , did n't expect that such a word would get an anglicisation ... you are good man . 
  i think , i have a lower iq than you xd, 
  `` polack '' instead of polak . 
  stopped reading this bs . 
  then i looked again over it saw `` lower iq '' stopped reading , enough internet for today xdd, 
  `` not even '' and that 's what every country should do lel . 
  however we have nice mama merkel who is inviting all these poor people that have to run from `` war '' instead of fighting for their country xd, 
  the role of turkey : `` accepting '' refugees , getting millions of money for `` free '' . 
  not giving them the turkish citizenship =  sending them to an european country after 2/5 years after they are `` officialy '' refugees from turkey , not from syria . 
  easy money , easy life ... 
  you mean , ikea like ? 
  i thought this would be rather `` bad '' news for germans . 
  in poland we talk about big companies from germany like mediamarkt , kaufland , saturn etc. 
  that pay 0 $ taxes in our country !, 
  that 's what will happen with these german starbucks ' , too . 
  less money for you , which ca n't be good , right ? 
  such `` rankings '' seem really dumb to me !, 
  germany is crying : `` oh man , poland is losing it 's democracy . 
  let 's tell the eu and punish them . 
  oh , something changed at their biggest tv company , this has to be a bad move !, 
  it 's for sure to only show certain things in the media and spread propaganda . '', 
  then obviously my country might drop 29 places , because of media from other countries , telling how bad our press freedom is xdd i mean , which data do you use to say that ireland has a `` better press freedom '' than their people from the uk ? 
  why is turkey at the same `` level '' like mexico ? 
  well , we know now that your son learned how to comment on polandball fb page xd, 
  stadt wien are you triggered yet ? 
  i 'm happy :d, 
  you know shit ;-), 
  you seem like uneducated ;-), 
  source : hungaryball on facebook . 
  [ hu -- pl relations wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations ) [ `` pole and hungarian cousins be '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ), 
  how is that related to the date where it was found ? 
  ( 960 a.d. ), 
  `` blur any person and sensible persons surroundings . 
  blur private areas which cant be seen by a normal pedestrian '' that \u00b4 s exactly the same in poland , still we are well coverd xd, 
  best ally ? 
  lol . 
  i think there are better allies in europe . 
  true , like most european countries , you have to decide : are you rather on usa \u00b4 s side or russia ... 
  i like the photoshopped with the muslims and merkel more :d http://i.imgur.com/exw8ii5.jpg, 
  `` i wouldnt say poland is safer than germany '' xddd, 
   turkey has no nukes wrong . 
  turkey has nukes `` from nato '' . 
  nato nukes are stationed in turkey , belgium , germany , italy and the netherlands . 
  additionaly to that , russia , england , france , china , india , pakistan , north korea and the usa have `` confirmed '' nukes . 
  probably many other countries , too . 
  like iran , israel ;-), 
  gg , very sad day . 
  space is space , who cares if you went there with your bus or your bicycle ? 
  you do realize that this already happend and is a meme ? 
  while turkeys `` democracry '' is no joke and real :d, 
  no , i will just mute you know instead . 
  posting on reddit what could be done in real life , wo n't help your country you know ? 
  you have also to do these things !, 
  i was just talking about the statistic , but you came up and mentioned things that have to be fixed in your country , so please move forward and invest sth . 
  for your children 's future , instead of writing about on reddit . 
  you are blocked now , since i ca n't help every single bastard on the internet . 
  kek, 
  true , but still # 1 in europe ... 
  when we had the euro 2012 in our country ( and ukraine ) , i heard many times the `` prejudice '' that we polish men are known for respecting our women in a great way . 
  i thought it 's funny , but it 's the third time now that a statistic is actually proving that right :-), 
  yeah yeah , just keep talking shit . 
  i heard in germany there are many people that do n't even try to work , since they get a flat and all they need `` for free '' and have a better life , than working for a few euros per hour :p, 
  there were times , where poland was one of the strongest if not the strongest power in europe . 
  today so many people with medium or low education leave still the country , because they get 4 times more paid in germany , england , sweden for basically the same job . 
  how are these the `` glorioues days '' ? 
  :p sure , i personally ca n't say anything bad and the rich people in my country wo n't either , but if you watch the lower levels of the society , you wo n't find many that are happy . 
  also if you want to talk about army , which was also glorious back then xd , it is n't great either . 
  why would americans sit in our country , if everything is great ? 
  the glorious days of poland : - /, 
  typical american nonsense . 
  hahahahaha, 
  morocco and alergia , also muslims .
