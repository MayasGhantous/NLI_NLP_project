  so where is the point ? 
  why do you try to defend anyone here , i do n't get it ... 
  as far as i know they were from syria , so get your things right . 
  if you think i 'm a criminal , car thief etc. 
  i would have nothing against that , as long as i 'm safe in my country !, 
  why would i care what other people think about me , as long as i do n't have to deal with them ? 
  if people from my country go to another one and `` steal cars , kill people ... '' then the consequences are ok . 
  same as germans have to accept if german pedophiles are arrested in poland and they get the prejudice , because of that . 
  now back to our cases from today : the whole difference here is : people steal ( in this case kill ) things/people in your country , while your politics do n't do anything against it , but do even the opposite : invite all people of the world to a great party - . -, 
  of course innocent people were the victims , which is sad . 
  but my point is that it 's one of the results of the `` welcome to all '' - merkel politics and it 's a `` penatly '' for the politics in germany , why would i want a penalty for innocent citizens ? 
  and ? 
  it 's germany and germans should have the right to rule over their countries . 
  if today would be your `` nineties '' and germany from then , would be europe today , maybe there would n't be a terror rate that is that high ... 
  i think , you missed something ... 
  if you want to tell me that i used the `` wrong word '' , ok . do n't call it `` mass rape '' , call it `` high rape per m \u00b2 per hour '' - . -, 
  '' the populist view that refugees = terrorist attacks is still wrong . '', 
  - . - i do n't want to discuss here again , because mama merkel is strong in this one ... just gon na say one thing : if there were no muslim refugees in france , do you think they would just fly over from syria and bomb people 1 day after ? 
  i think it 's safe to say , that it 's way easier to kill people , if you live in the country , you want to do such an attack , right ? 
  first of all : a muslim refugee killed a person after he was 1 year in germany . 
  who cares if he is from isis , al kaida or just killed because he can - . - second : like @shakal7 already said `` polish citizens '' , because there were at least 2 dead polish people at the attack in nice . 
  what ? 
  the point is that merkel should n't care that much what is going on in other countries ... 
  racist ? 
  dude , if you want terorists in your country , take them . 
  you can have them all !, 
  i wo n't be sad for a moment that you call me a racist on the internet hahaha, 
  `` it that why all the poles are leaving to over countries . '', 
  here the difference starts , i ca n't remember when a polish emigrant did a teror attack the last time ... hmm , but ok ;-) `` all the poles '' , yeah because there are like 50 million polish people in your fucking ass country , right ? 
  xd i 'm not gon na discuss with a random boy on the internet what he thinks of muslim terorists or not , great that you will fuck off from the eu !, 
  i do n't want scum in my country , that 's all . 
  and i hope that never happens !, 
  now that a muslim killed a polish pregnant woman in europe , i 'm 100 % sure we all polish people should re-think and maybe accept `` refugees '' , right ? 
  the problem you forget , is that the big amount of turkish people have already german citizenship , so obviously in your statistic they are listed under `` german '' . 
  same goes for the the attacker of munich : most media wanted to call the community down , against muslims , so they just said `` it 's a german '' at the beginning , not mentioning that he has roots from iran ... 
  retarded ? 
  who cares about the love ? 
  i just read the first few words from this guy saying `` he did n't break any law in poland '' . 
  so since when is it legal here , to open a filesharing site that contains copyright content ? 
  correct , it 's not allowed !, 
  why do you talk so much shit ? 
  please stop using the internet and sharing false information . 
  please do n't share idiotic thoughts about `` what would be the best way , to kill as many people as possible '' , ok ? 
  yeah i 'm not `` pro guns '' either , but with this amount of radical muslims in europe , no idea if a gun or two would n't avoid certain things ... 
  you can argue both ways : ( ofcourse with the typical sterotypes ) american : if people in the train had guns , he would n't even touched 2 people and already be dead . 
  european : good that he could n't get a firegun , so he only had an axe/truck / * ... * : `` only '' , because we saw what a man with a truck can do ... 
  erdogan is very lucky that only a smaller group of soldiers wanted that . 
  if the whole army joined that action , there should/would be no real way , to stop them !, 
  sadly ? 
  in certrain sports , yes :d, 
  now the 1-1 against portugal does n't feel that bad anymore : _ ), 
  finally !, 
  i do n't know if it was the world championship , or sth . 
  else , but i remember that we were close to getting # 1 last time , too but that we sadly had too few golden medals !, 
  happy for them boys and grills xd, 
  i tell you one thing : i know many people ( mostly older one ) that repeat every day , that communism was better and believe me , i do n't even try to discuss , because i know that it might be true . 
  sure , there were no rich people , but there were no poor people either and the country cares about the infrastructure , investements etc. 
  so even if obama himself used your words `` should care about democracy , because without it shit can get bad very quickly . '', 
  that would n't really help , because obviously they would react like that : `` ok then . 
  so no `` democracy '' ? 
  can we pls get more money now ? 
  it 's the safest country in europe , not only for jew , but for nearly everyone , since we do n't have many muslims in our country and a good anti-terror force :-), 
  no , the biggest issue is the money of low educated polish people , they fucking dont care what happens with the politics , they wanted a fair life , so they voted for another party . 
  what does democracy help me , if i have to work for 20 years to get the same car , a german person can get , with the exact same work ) in 5 years ? 
  i can buy food for my family and pay taxes with this `` d e m o c r a c y '' , right ? 
  i hope you got my point . 
  like i already wrote in many posts here , tried to explain . 
  so i just copy past it : '' [ ... ] more about `` i do n't care '' . 
  the `` average '' pole ( ok maybe slightly-undereverage ) gets 20 % of the money for the same work as someone does in other countries , who the fuck cares then for such changes ? 
  most people just voted for right-wing party , because they wanted a change , if there wo n't be any `` war '' and people will live in freedom , they do n't really care , at all ! '', 
  now you come here and think that we are stupid , but now that big obama tells us that we have to worry , we will start worrying ? 
  wtf ? 
  it does n't care if it 's merkel or obama , that 's not the problem !, 
  the problem is that so much time passed since ww1 and ww2 , poland was rebuilt etc. 
  and still people get paid for work like in some 3rd world country in africa !, 
  that 's the problem . 
  and again , why should a 60 y.o person ( who wo n't be able to live from their annuity , when he turns 67 ) care about some changes in the system , when it has no `` direct '' effects ? 
  yes , and that 's exactly the reason why `` noone '' cares !, 
  most people voted for this right party , to have a change !, 
  because low educated people get way less money than for the same work in other countries . 
  sorry if that sounds `` harsh '' , but these people do n't give a shit about any change , until everything is in piece and the financial situation wo n't get worse !, 
  it 's less about understanding , but more about `` i do n't care '' . 
  the `` average '' pole ( ok maybe slightly-undereverage ) gets 20 % of the money for the same work as someone does in other countries , who the fuck cares then for democracy ? 
  most people just voted for right-wing party , because they wanted a change , if there wo n't be any `` war '' and people will live in freedom , they do n't really care , at all !, 
  when we already talk about windturbine sizes . 
  [ we had the `` biggest '' one in the world back in 2012 with 210 meters ] ( http://epoznan.pl/gallery2/476/dr2jtzmgmmkqgxvcjc6y4z8mb7747q2z_gallery.jpg?1402508643 ) . 
  over 4 years though , so the record is probably already beaten :p quite interesting topic though , when i travel through some parts of my country there are areas that are full of modern turbines . 
  though they seem smaller , than the one that were built 5-10 years ago . 
  as a polish person : most people here are mad at `` history '' , how poland went from the poland that had power and was known , to the `` needs money to rebuild the whole country '' - country . 
  biggest shot was obviously fired when germany and russia decided that they have to help each other to eliminate poland from the map . 
  after the end of ww2 most bigger cities , roads etc. 
  had to be rebuilt completely . 
  so ofcourse most people are not satisfied . 
  we are one step infront the goal and then our country joins the eu and `` right-based '' parties from england , germany and co. say that they spent their money for us !, 
  none mentions that they invest money in our country and not give it to us . 
  another reason : people telling us what to do . 
  one example is the german eu politics martin schulz , who raged 100 times at tv : all countries have to accept all kind of refugees . 
  it 's not ok , to just take money but not accept them . 
  obiously many people see in that a `` unbalanced power in the eu . '', 
  you can say it like that : germans again try to rule over europe by telling us what to do !,
