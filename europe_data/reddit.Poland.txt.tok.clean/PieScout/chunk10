  why not just scotland ? 
  * you mean all of our culture is our glorious culture that litwa did not contribute to * / s,

  ** rekt **, 
  glorious stork . 
  a large majority of people i know / heard from voted leave for the shits and giggles ... 
  i think its the stork , ** i think ... **, 
  they should lower the voting age to 16 like scotland did for its referrendum . 
  the elders really threw the young generation under the bus : /, 
  ok , let me just clear this up because when i read it i got really damn pissed . 
  what you just described to me is very very ** very ** inaccurate representation of poles , just like with everything ` the bad stuff shines brightest ' , like i do n't even classify that representation as fellow polish people . 
  most ** actual ** polish people ( nowadays ) already know english and have degrees in different fields which is a problem for poland because those people with degrees are needed really damn badly . . and they 're young so they are needed * very badly * . 
  my father for example did not learn english in schools because of communism ( duh but at least he has russian ) so when he moved to america he learned english there with no help . 
  polish people are very adaptive and we are brought up on ` work hard now and you children will have a better life ' stuff like that , and depending on what region ( maybe ) and your background religion might play a huge role in your life ; but in the uk poles are more culturally catholic than practicing . 
  as an immigrant in the uk , im scared ... 
  * we 're serious *, 
  polska loves uk !, 
  plz do n't go : c, 
  the secret prison in poland is not secret ... it was on the news last year and the where-abouts were told . 
  `` fuck off '' - love from wales .

  * wow i did not expect that to actually happen *, 
  im not trying to wipe away the british , not at all , im just saying how everyone forgot that a lot of foreign fighters helped in the battle of britain and after all out countries have gone through the uneducated polititions out there just want to kick us out . 
  the school i went to never taught anything about the battle of britain , its probably because the town im in has a lot of britain first activity . 
  yes i know , its just the school education system * does not * teach anything about how the czechoslovakian and polish air forces won the battle of britain . 
  no i mean , the school system ** does not ** mention or teach anything about how the czechoslovakian and polish air forces won the battle of britain . 
  its all told to be the british forces but the truth is the british were loosing against the germans badly . 
  yea but british people do n't know their own history properly . 
  * gosh why do poles complain so much its annoying and god its annoying boy its good i do n't complain * . 
  i live in the uk and its not really that bad most of the time ... until you go to the polish deli and - why is everything expencive,

  russia should totally be removed from sporting events because they are always violent i totally agree , its just by doing that they will be more violent ... 
  yes but they 're russians , of course an official would cheer them on for beating up the dirty western pigs . 
  i have no idea what just happened .

  * yes comrade *, 
  boom russia in a nutshell .
