  or one of those really cheep ones ) focus on middle aged ** british ** men who work low skilled jobs ( no offence if anybody here reads these types of newspapers ) . 
  the class that reads these newspapers are also very against immigration . 
  so now when i 've taken all of this into accout i 've basically just wasted my time ... 
  wow that makes me feel worse . 
  ** god damn it most of them are polish **, 
  eyy . 
  as an eastern european lady i can confirm it does not . 
  sweden can not into patriotism . 
   great accent, 
  see you 're thinking outside the box . 
  but would n't that mean a cardinal would have to give birth to you ? 
  this slav right here . 
  i really wan na be czech , they 're really stable and fun to hang out with . 
  or maybe finland because its fucking finland . 
  i live in the uk and let me tell you as a foreigner in this country , yes its really damn fun . 
  * poland has not perished my friends *, 
  what countries actually qualified this year ? 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfpepjfb12g ) talks a lot about it , although its about the slavic * language * its accurate because when the tribes started to move about so did the language . 
  beautiful . 
  i give you permission to squat . 
  potatos !, 
  western slavs best slavs . 
  but we have some similarities , and long ago we were one culture . 
  we 're called a lot of things . 
  but we 're slavs ... 
  even the gene its self , is squatting . 
  lol no . 
  its genetic . 
  see , the slavic culture was pretty alright , but then the soviet union came about and now we ca n't have nice things . 
  you ca n't be a slav if you do n't love russia bla bla bla . 
  ** well where the fuck is the middle group **, 
  croatia , czechia , slovakia , slovenia and hungary all use the latin alphabet and have very similar cultures . 
  ( exculding hungary and the baltics ) eastern europe is split into 3 slav groups , west , south and east and each of the 3 groups are influenced by their non-slavic neighbours . 
  for poland , czechia and slovakia we were influenced by germany and austria whilst the eastern slavic countries are more mixed because of how much land russia takes up which gives them many neighbours . 
  um , are you totally sure ? 
  the further east you go in poland the more eastern european the culture and places look and feel . 
  geographically we are more central europe but come on all slavs are really similar and eastern european . 
  im polish actually but i 've been living in the uk for a long time . 
  with what i see , yee eastern european countries are either team russia or team nato . 
  serbja can not into russias love . 
  i mean i am polish . 
  yea it always backfires , because russia wants all the power where no one else gets a say in how things are run . 
  yea russia will probably forget . 
  russia is still butthurt over the cold war and how nobody wanted to be their comrade , whilst ukraine wants both good relations with the eu and russia but thats impossible in europe . 
  because ukraine is becoming more westernised and russia does not want that . 
  you a commie ? 
  if germany * really * pisses of russia , they have their minority to fall back on when people ask why they 'd start the war . 
  serbia is always forgotten about , its funny because of how much serbs love russia . 
  well not anymore . . 
  woo number 4 babyyyy . 
  is this ... german humour ? 
  ** shit this is not good **, 
  ** shots fired **, 
  because its tasty , but it does not taste the same when its out of christmas time : /, 
  i swear , no one ever eats karp outside of christmas time . 
  well , i do live in the uk for quite some time now ... 
  well glorious polska is just around the courner and we have loads of lidls c :, 
  growing up , when ever i asked about ww2 i got told that saying . 
  its pretty damn true . 
  oh my fucking christ its just lidl calm your shit . 
  are you sure ? 
  your description sounds more like roma gypsies . 
  well now its luton , if you look well enough , there are books and studies that say luton is the worst town in the uk . 
  its known as the worst town in the uk ... 
  * few * thank god i did not go this year . 
  i do n't get it . - . 
  wait , so its not being cut ? 
  ** everybody sign **, 
  start a kickstarter for it . 
  russia is the worst thing to happen to the world - polska, 
  we really are very intolorent . 
  pretty legit . 
  we just ca n't stand the fack that russia is slavic whilst everyone else is not . 
  really damn accurate . 
  yea , its all russia 's fault : /, 
  ok , most slavic countries hate each other sadly , but holy hell we are are basically family . 
  but you are our comrades :3, 
  yes we 're all slavic we are all too similar to each other . 
  75 % , i have lived in the uk for 10 years and i passed :d, 
  thanks man . 
  * pierogi are better m80 *, 
  i am a pole who grew up in the uk , saying im a brit of polish decent kind of insulted me somehow . 
  whilst reading i was thinking about my past experiences with my cultural identity because its kinda complicated . 
  i was born in poland , i identify as polish , i follow the culture and religion , speak the language and love my home country . 
  but when i was really young my father moved my family to the uk because situations back home were too poor and at the time my father was moving to the us and back , he then got an opportunity to live in the uk because its closer and was better for him . 
  the primary school i attended somewhat brainwashed me , keep in mind i was very young . 
  they taught me the ` queens english ' , made it so i * really * celebrate british holidays ( although my parents never somewhat want me to ) and in a way when i was really young made me forget what nationality i was . 
  when i moved up to high school and started thinking for myself , something turned on and i started learning about poland ** myself ** because i never when to school back home so i never got a polish education . 
  i was mindblown ; the uk ai n't shit compared to poland , i was proud to be the nationality i was born into but when i realized that as a kid i disrespected by culture so badly i felt really damn bad . 
  because of how i was brought up my polish is starting to get really bad and im extremely self-conscious when talking to other polish people because i 've been in situations where i say something that makes no sense and im made fun of , and i feel even worse because i love my nationality and my culture but to most other polish people i just look at me as an ` anglik ' . 
  but what i 've noticed over the years is that i do n't get along with polish people and most ** super british people ** , i always got along with people who are ` international ' and not my culture and british people who are not fully british or have interests in different countries ( really hard to find those times of people here ) , especially recently people from other post soviet countries that have also moved to the uk because times were tough back home ; what we have in common is that we 're all very appreciative of being where we are at and we talk about how our parents and their families hated communism ( sometimes the pro-russian person comes along but we just shrug them off ) . 
  ** tl : dr ** : poland is better than uk m8 and im self conscious about who i people my mother tongue . 
  lol poland 's cities have no counter-parts . 
  thats right you do ... 
  with my experience , hungarians in the uk usually stay close to the romanians . 
  so are we really that bad ? 
  if our government and the hungarian government were not so fucked up i think our countries friendship would of been forgotten by the general public : c, 
  the czechs , slovakians and hungarians are the most popular choice for polish people , but i live in the uk and let me tell you , hungarians dont talk much to us here and there are not that many czechs and slovakians here , but you know who does ? 
  lithuanians . 
  2 of my closest friends are from there and although when we speak about russia we dissagree we are actually very similar .
