  `` good job putting stairs for the wheelchair cyka comrade !, 
  by the way you hear tank noise - kurva is russian shit storm '' . 
  brb moving to australia . 
  poland at number 36 , we can do better . 
  so why did they say it 's inhuman ? 
  first the us , now france ? 
  who 's next ? 
  find out on the next episode of hetalia, 
  is it inhume because they 're banning a person in a wheelchair ? 
  stop shout kurwa, 
  its in all caps so it seems they 're shouting, 
  most people in poland forget about ireland , i live in the u.k. and let me tell you polish people and irish people are like a hand in a glove . 
  we 're so similar , i 've never met or seen a pole and an irish person not get along . 
  this video has been posted on here before but i do n't mind . 
  i love the video and hope irish becomes more wide spread with the irish people . 
  polan can not in to child . 
  but it 's ok portugal is worse, 
  more like deutsch . 
  and serbia je russia, 
  i like how she said staged . 
  because you can stage death . 
  the russian soldiers in ukraine are staged . 
  lol london probably ca n't participate, 
  ** triggered in polish **, 
  i do n't understand , is it just in rome or across europe ? 
  aleksander, 
  ** gets popcorn **, 
  ** all ch\u0142odnik now !, 
  all ch\u0142odnik now . 
  shh it 's ok . 
  t h i c c, 
  ukraine , i choose you !, 
  * to fill the gap made by the people who left our country *, 
  lol really ? 
  are you sure ? 
  are we talking about poland , poland ? 
  the one everyone is leaving ? 
  yea . . just marie curie and lech wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  poland only has 3 ? 
  really ? 
  sweden can not into swedish . 
  poland did that ... 
  shave his moustache as well . 
  all i 'm thinking of is kurdish weeaboos . 
  japan took refugees ? 
  there are turks in japan wut, 
  i blame the germans . 
  see i work in an airport that does flights to cork and dublin . 
  usually people flying to cork have a strong irish accent ... like could you repeat that again x4 ... whilst the people going to dublin have a more brit-afied accent . 
  i never even knew cork had a independence movement . 
  i 've missed you flag-beard-man . 
  not gon na lie , if it were from a game i play i would make it my home and lock screen . 
  `` you would think this is not germany but it is germany '' . 
  aw do n't bully w\u0119gry . 
  my friend you 're a national treasure :3, 
  god bless tusk-sama . 
  he fits the picture pretty well . 
  tvp makes me lose iq points whenever i watch it . 
  damn it greece control your gods . 
  god damn gorale . 
  18th baby woo, 
  can i volunteer as tribute ? 
  london school yes my friend english very good . 
  u r not my friend , you are my brother my friend . 
  ** finally **, 
  wait , no air ... polen can into space ? 
  sadly no . 
  tldr : poland has been covered in gasoline and set on fire , instead of putting the fire out , more gasoline is being thrown on the fire because our politicians expect the gasoline to put it out . 
  ouch my feelings . 
  you 're onto something . 
  oh fuck since when is this hetalia . 
  ha ha :d, 
  china is in germany ? 
  since when ? 
  * inhales * ** china **, 
  holy shit that 's amazing . 
  can korwin just like ... stop breathing ? 
  fuck off france he 's ours . 
  he looks like justin trudeu ( i spelt that wrong whoops ) . 
  oh god what is that thing, 
  excuse me the potatoes are not mashed, 
  cheers . 
  ok the tesla post made sence . 
  i need an explanation for this . 
  do n't worry , before a nation is accepted into the eu there 's like loads of different examinations they have to pass ( most of them are human rights related or so ) . 
  this is why serbia and turkey are having such a hard time getting into the eu because they 're not passing their examinations . 
  i 'm disappointed in the polish immigrants that just let this happen . 
  god dang yanks !, 
  it 's thursday not tuesday ... 
  lol new city . 
  i fucking love how he gave the new station a japanese name to call him . 
  japanese iron sucks . 
  * sneaky albanian flag . 
  probably all killed each other . 
  polan can into hockey ? 
  you misspelt polska there guys / s, 
  i 'm not gon na lie i really wanted to like this when i saw it , then i watched it ... it 's extremely bad : /, 
  explain ... * edit * : i got to watch the video .

  we need to pray for spain ladies and gentlemen this is an attack .
