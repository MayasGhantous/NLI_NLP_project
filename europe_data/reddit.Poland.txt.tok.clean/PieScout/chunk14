  his fame seeped into csgo for a while . 
  i 've seen that series , it 's pretty good , personally i think poles are put off by how russian are so brainwashed ( hear me out ) . 
  your government seems to teach that anything close to russia is theirs and if you disagree with the government or protest against it you 're wrong . 
  i myself am put of by the fact that freedom of speech is very limited . 
  but let me tell you ; when you tear down the political wall we are basically family ... 
  come on neo was classified as the best csgo player for a few years .

  holy shit guys a russian guy just complimented us . 
  i 'm going to down vote this post . 
  not because it 's bad .

  time travellers from japan came to world war two italy and told them about their idea for an anime they wanted to make about the axis powers . 
  is n't poroshenko under suspicion of corruption right now ? 
  i heard he 's been stealing money to fund his company or something . 
  ukrainians are the polish people of poland ( let me explain ) . 
  in the eu the poles do the jobs no one wants to do , in poland the ukrainians do the jobs no one wants to do . 
  why is latvia 's an anime character ? 
  they 're still not in the eu though ... 
  kabum tss .
