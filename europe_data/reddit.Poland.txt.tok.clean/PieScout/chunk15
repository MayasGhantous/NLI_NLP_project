  they deserve the win 100 % . 
  extreamly talented team . 
  everyone , we need to get these numbers higher, 
  turkey , armenia , azerbaijan and georgia not in yurope ? 
  * thinks *, 
  `` would you be comfortable if you child was in a relationship with a polish person ? '', 
  pretty acurate i 'd say . 
  they 're still selling the eurovision songs of the year on cds , and they 're actually being bought . 
  you know they still make eurovision cds right ? 
  * turkey not europe , but armenia , azerbaijan and georgia are * ** thinks **, 
  more like ukraine / s, 
  gorale are similar to us , the natives of greenland are a different race to danes . 
  but apart from that stupid argument , everyone knows greenland will not get its independence any time soon , but maybe one day . 
  the land is too dependent on danish money . 
  probably in teh future tho , not now that is . 
  everyone knows how dependent greenland is on the dank dane money . 
  greenland really should get their independance . 
  what hobnobs tho, 
  what biscuit was it tho, 
  well , with what i here of the stereotypes from florida ... 
  ty m9, 
  it took me way to long to notice that this is meant to look like as if the roman empire were an actual country . 
  rip , you 're not polish enough, 
  agreed, 
  yep, 
  damn it we 're florida, 
  heck yea, 
  maybe ... salty ? 
  hmm , are you sure man ? 
  i live in the uk and every shop that sells polish apples ( obviously imported ) taste the same , they taste good . 
  my friend i think the russian propaganda got to your taste buds . 
  are they ... ** triggered ? 
  you sound like you 've never had one of the best apples a nation ( its poland btw ) can give to this bad apple world . 
  or you 're just a salty ruski . 
  bit like when they banned our glorious polski apples . 
  god damn yanks . 
  ha ... ha ... 
  poland / s, 
  poland is strange in the fact that economically , poland and germany work well together like a hand in a glove . 
  but the people seem to not like each other ... 
  were they playing against a german team by any chance ? 
  i mean is kinda true , most of the people in the home army were very young , which is why we still have living uprising veterans . 
  wait , spain had the louisiana area ? 
  was n't it french ? 
  * fine yourself a man who can protec but also be kute *, 
  lol who cares pff, 
  thats actually really cute . 
  screw you czechy our tatry are higher !, 
  they have ... right ? 
  the people against it won the court order ... 
  oh jan pawel we finally we did it , im actually crying, 
  the triggered kaczy\u0144ski meme is my favorite :3, 
  im aware , 4 for # 1 , along with cheap polish energy drinks . 
  cool * people . 
  everyone is allowed in the frugo club . 
  tymbark is good and all ... but its old . 
  frugo is fuckin ' ** hip with the new kids boi ** * scateboards away *, 
  frugo proves that poland is god 's favorite country . 
  ** where is maluch **, 
  dude i know about the thrift shops growing up they were the only places we could shop in , and they are always run by a grumpy old lady : /, 
  close enough . 
  what my family do , is send my family back home stuff that we buy in the uk that they can also but in poland , but if we buy it for them they wo n't become homeless after buying it in poland . 
  * thanks iron curtain for fucking up europe to this day *, 
  what are the other numbers not in red about ? 
  * kabum tss *, 
  wow ... thanks . 
  they will become the new french , but instead of strikes its protests . 
  hell yea !, 
  polan best anime, 
  um . . take their sabers ? 
  * puts w\u00f3dka away : c *, 
  we did it kurwa get the w\u00d3dka we celebrate, 
  all single handedly ... 
  its kinda s\u0105d how western news have not been shedding light onto this yet ... 
  i swear leopold like caused a genocide . 
  roses are a huge deal , they have good yogurt , lost of caves , rapid declining populations with abandoned towns , i once watched a documentary about how bulgaria has no heros that fought for the country ( or something along the lines of that ? 
  ) , nice beaches , cheap place to go on holiday , birth place of cyrilic , very cool place . 
  not voting . 
  only about 6 million people voted for pis out of a population of 40 million ... 
  where do i sign . 
  its because the elderly went through ww2 , poverty , communism , everything . 
  they 've seen it all so they know best and they do not want to pass the baton to the young generation , the ones who have not fought wars or lived under communism . 
  if he is so grief stricken to the point of insanity he needs to ** step down for the love of jan pawe\u0142 **, 
  phones were being taken from people filming by pis henchmen , its like we 're turning into the ukrainian government , there will be fighting soon . 
  and he 's a anti-social lonely old man who eats by himself everyday . 
  jarek in a nutshell, 
  he 's still playing with it lol, 
  do n't worry , we 're nearly there too . 
  i am many , nature prophet , death prophet ... bout it, 
  me too . 
  it took me years to understand the joke . 
  holy christ . 
  wilno :p, 
  i smell turkey, 
  i dont get it ... 
  its meant to be polish ... 
  the french and the brits . 
  im claiming this picture as the most perfect thing to come out of litwa .
