  ` of the world ',

  i must say , russians have quite the imagination . 
  well , yes we were on the map but half was under soviet control the other by nazi : /, 
  so when poland was not on the map yes ? 
  when was this :o, 
  hmm ... not legit enough . 
  hm , ` how poland was portrayed ' , in the clip the lady says romania , the butcher sounds like an american trying polish for the first time ... hmm smells fishy . .

  war in a nutshell . 
  im not explaining , go read a book ... 
  iz good . 
  lets not bring this up again ... 
  they should know by now . 
  what the hell is polands one about ... 
  * always read the thread before typing *, 
  its a yaoi anime so all of the male characters are gay yes i know , but polands personality is compleatly wrong , thats it . 
  i know who miroslaw is , stop sending me wiki pages : /, 
  with what my government wants me to know , it was actually the ukrainians . 
  but i understand where you 're coming from . 
  yes but thats accurate we 're not gay or stupid dude . 
  yea i know it what i said was ment to be kinda a joke . 
  i blame putin . 
  he probably tells the people that the relationship is totally fine but its a bit complicated . 
  ** when you 're down , down low ** . 
  kartofel best potato . 
  ` does not like russia ' . 
  i mean come on that 's a joke right ? 
  i 'll pay it myself god damn it . 
  ** but he 's a cocky crossdresser **, 
  100 % will do . 
  ** i need answers **, 
  ok i kinda get it now thanks . 
  will do . 
  open ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  what is it talking about ? 
  yes everyone is gay , but why is poland * super gay * ? 
  who actually wanted to change the name ? 
  the government or the people ? 
  you just watch me . 
  what about czechy ? 
  i did not want it to seem crule im sorry : c, 
  it just sounds so good . 
  * finally * somebody agrees that poland looks like a guy with a weird hairdo on :d, 
  wow revenge must taste good for them now . 
  im not explaining why we 're called poland again look it up yourself guys . 
  that 's exactly what i said . 
  also ; we 're mean and really somewhat self-centered and we only think of ourselves . 
  we should get the whole subreddit to photoshop money onto the map of portugal just to make them feel better . 
  i swear to jan pawel if i see ` can not into space ' one more time i 'll build a spaceship myself . 
  why do we hate russians ? 
  well ... 
  ** how dare you mention space ** . 
  the japanese think we 're stupid and gay . 
  * beautiful explanation *, 
  japanophile is when someone is ** super ** interested in the culture but not so much anime , weeaboo is wanting to be japanese after watching 3 animes . 
  ok this is just hetalia . 
  also ** i do n't remember armenia in the anime i need explanation ** . 
  i mean it is france ... 
  why are we catholic ? 
  because poland . 
  simple my friend . 
  i mean , historically polish people have basically been the field people , without our glorious fields ** we ** would of never invented vodka . 
  our fields really do make up our country and i personally like the story behind poland 's name . 
  duh of course we can but no one seems to remember them except for us : c, 
  you do n't like czechia ? 
  * poland can not into stronk : c *, 
  good point , why is the czech republic not called bohemia ? 
  for ever and ever amen . 
  ` called poland ' ? 
  ** clears throat ** well its because when poland finally became a country when adopting christianity , we were just named after our fields . 
  the polish word for field is pole/pola so just comebine that shit with ska and you have polska . 
  we hate china ?
