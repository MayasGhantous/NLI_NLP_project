  since when ? 
  oh and im quite sure the whole of north africa is never shown on maps of europe . 
  proud of you . 
  norway and turkey just look so accurate . 
  well , at least poland is still green . 
  come to think of it ... we 're all huge assholes every now and again ... 
  we worship mushrooms . 
  mushrooms are love mushrooms are life . 
  well if history has taught me anything about russian and german relations there is always something in the middle ... * plot twist they speak polish *, 
  you should just move back to canada anyways , europe is going more down hill everyday . 
  so basically , i retired army guy who fought in afghanistan thought the portuguese people were muslim and started being super racist to them whilst people joined in ... god damn it poland get your shit together : c, 
  so . . the japanese got this stereotype from the americans ... . - . 
  i find the poland character in hetalia really fucking annoying , he 's some what gay , really stupid but there is still something about him that 's really polish ... do the japanese really see us as stupid camp people ? 
  eyyy somebody said it , my man m80 . 
  south east poland . 
  i do n't even know what the lard thing is all about ... explain plz . 
  ` can not into nordic ' *, 
  latvia can not into potato . 
  4-5 and 6 + is usually seen in families from africa and muslim countries , depending where you live in europe its not that uncommon . 
  i asked this question last year ( well not exactly the same but along the same line ) . 
  and im still curious , how are / r/europe 's belorussians doing ? 
  ** stupid people ** ... 
  it sounds like some generic anime theme song . 
  i do n't blame you . 
  my laptop broke last year as i started college and without the support of video games after a hard days work its been hard . 
  shame only south and east europe ... im the uk : /, 
  what sub ? 
  how does that even work . 
  m8 my voivodeship has macedonia . 
  the eu is great for people that want to start a new life somewhere else or for someone that wants to improve the quality of living for themselves and their families ; british people tends to not immigrate . 
  also when britan joined the eu was just a trade agreement but as times changed and countries join britan started wanting to leave because they had less power over what britan can do . 
  you ca n't be more correct . 
  mutts are the best dogs to have , even cat cross-breeds are popular in poland , crossbreeds best breeds . 
  yep . 
  just another day in good ol' luton . 
   gurbuz represents the high town ward in luton after being elected in may 2015 . 
  she also sits on a panel supervising bedfordshire police . 
  beautiful ... 
  i mean ... like actually beat them and ** win ** the world cup . 
  now i like the concept and i love my country but hahaha oh my god * wheeze * poland as a super power , and we beat brazil in football * whoo * hahahaha that 's a good one . 
  same here . 
  i think ( just like everybody else ) russia is only hated for its politics and the brainwashed people who really think everyone is against russia and shit like that . 
  culturally we 're quite similar ( well all slavic countries are ) . 
  excuse me , where are the polish ? 
  you guys are really close to russia . 
  you 're number 1 to us ... but we 're number 2 for you ... ** depression intensifies **, 
  yea we hate everyone . 
  im quite surprised that italians are more favorable than hungarians : /, 
  we need jeremy kyle to sort this out ... 
  i mean , the comment explains the situation well . 
  its like poland and russia ... its like talking to a brick wall ... 
  well , historically kosovo is really important to serbia and its probably the pain of seeing something important as that stab you in the back in a way . 
  also rita ora is from kosovo and i 'm quite sure serbia would want her on their serbian list . 
  western europe will obviously lose its christian religion but look at eastern europe and southern europe , they 're very religious and it does not look like they 're becoming athiest anytime soon .

  oooooh , thanks that helped a lot . 
  may i ask , whats a kangaroo court ? 
  ok its not as large as the ukrainian but its growing , last year it was on the news . 
  there is a very large russian population in poland who have moved because of the same reason as you . 
  go to / r/poland and you 'll get some sort of response because this topic has been talked about .
