  when some people hear you `` dare '' say this , they go on an insane tangent about how you must hate soros and so on . 
  i am !, 
  how did you know ? 
  but seriously - omg !, 
  here i go being so serous again  - are you surprised that someone responds to a statement they see as untrue ? 
  well it depends what you mean by anti eu . 
  do they want to leave the eu ? 
  do they criticize the eu on certain aspects ? 
  yes . 
  i wouldnt call this nitpicking . 
  your statement just isnt true so i pointed it out , im not calling you out on a technicality or a minor detail , i disagree with the full sentence . 
  sadly , i have to agree , i wish it wasnt different but ... 
  the only thing i would partially disagree with is '' so in the end , it 's the fault of voters being dumb . '' . 
  while i agree with this , i think our system is partially to blame for it - the lack of interest of people , how easy it is to influence masses , etc. 
  not true , there will always be protests , no matter who is in charge and no matter what they do . 
  its impossible to govern perfectly and fix everyones problems without causing some other . 
  the only debatable thing is the scale of protests . 
  no , but they are constantly showed as such . 
  i dont see a problem in that , its just stating a fact . 
  saying this doesnt make someone a shill . 
   it 's not entirely their fault either , considering the level of political debate in this country has been dragged down to the level of literally photoshoping donald tusk in a nazi uniform . 
  the fault lies on both sides ( not just politicians , but the media backing them ) . 
  sadly the level of debate has been shit for a long time and it probably wont improve . 
  while that photoshop was stupid , showing your opponents in extreme ways isnt new , for example newsweek front cover of macierewicz ( important politic in pis ) as a taliban . 
  but this is actually true ( organizing buses to get people to warsaw , not the soros part ) . 
   while pis will likely try to discredit it as always by saying that there were maybe 8,000 and everyone was paid to attend . 
  edit : lo and behold a pis shill appears in the thread . 
  i dont see anyone saying there were 8000 people , so when you say shill you mean someone stating the fact ( [ for example ] ( http://wroclaw.wyborcza.pl/wroclaw/7,35771,21756583,platforma-szykuje-autobusy-na-marsz-wolnosci.html ) ) that po is paying for buses to get people to warsaw ? 
   those estimates are so wildly diverging exactly , i understand it can be hard to get exact estimates , but the famous `` 250 000 '' march was just ridiculous . 
  edit : why the hell is this a controversial topic ? 
  even when gazeta.pl ( one of the main anti-pis media ) counted how many people there were during that march , they counted around 60 000 people . 
  compare that to the 45 000 police estimate and the ** 240 000 ** estimate of town hall . 
  are you against this specific topic of referendum or generally asking the population that left their country to weigh in on any matter ( like elections ) ? 
  fair enough , that makes sense . 
  thanks . 
  does it ? 
  admittedly , my knowledge of the german constitution is basically non-existence ( thats why im asking ) , but when it says `` death penalty is abolished '' , doesnt that refer to death penalty in germany only ? 
  the referendum would be about the death penalty in another country . 
  well its either that or a specific referendum on what should be changed . 
  its to early to tell . 
  while it definitely would put pressure on the rest of the parties , it doesnt force them to do anything . 
  most of the other parties are considered `` total opposition '' : anything pis says/does is horrible , a good portion of their voters think in the same way , so its very likely that even with a majority `` yes '' referendum , they will oppose the changes . 
  read it again ... 
  i didnt say a word about may or even this threads topic . 
  recap : * ** operationcalendos ** : `` it 's a good thing thank god for your brexiters . '', 
  * ** h33i0 ** replies to ** operationcalendos ** : `` i voted remain , mate . '', 
  * ** kaerbemevig ** : `` read it again . 
  he ( operationcalendos ) never said you ( h33i0 ) were a brexiter . 
   '' * ** me ** : `` read it again . 
  he ( h33i0 ) never said he ( operationcalendos ) said he ( h33i0 ) was a brexiter . 
   '' but if you want to discuss this topic , fine by me . 
   stop it . 
  i conveniently assume that may produces only white noise . 
  whatever she says is either void or vague at best . 
  in comparison to someone like jeremy corbyn , may actually answers questions and speaks on point . 
   she may even lose elections . 
  everythings possible , but i wouldnt hold my breath if i were you . 
   and the picture is that we know nothing . 
  literally just nothing . 
  i wouldnt go that far . 
  taking into account what we do know i strongly disagree with / u/operationcalendos on this topic and personally think may is a good option for the uk . 
  very good idea , the constitution really could use improving , but i doubt anything will come out of it since 2/3 votes are required in parliament to change the constitution ( which pis doesnt have ) . 
  read it again . 
  he never said he said he was a brexiter . 
  my point exactly  i tried to give a random example of something with no political connections , yet i instantly saw a couple , lets face it - kaczynski is omnipresent ... 
  i completely understand that , there is absolutely nothing wrong with your comment i said it myself : your comparison is pretty good . 
  my comment was a not so serious remark about people having the `` talent '' of connecting any random topic to pis . 
  you could be talking about drinking a beer at the beach in the states and they would be able to connect it someway to kaczynski . 
  not saying that is you , i obviously dont know you , it just seemed similar . 
  cheers . 
  obviously , im not insulted/angered/anything like that . 
  the comparison you gave was actually pretty close , just that this topic had nothing to do with pis/duda , yet you connected it , 
  no offence , but i think you might have a slight obsession . 
  macron using the new `` white power '' sign , 
  hard to say , but i doubt anything meaningful will come out of this due to pis not being able to work with most of the opposition ( both sides are at fault ) . 
  if they are able to change anything or not , its also a political/pr move : * to blame the opposition if and when nothing gets fixed - `` look , they are not willing to work with us to help you ( the people ) '' . 
  * to improve relations ( `` steal voters '' ) with another parliament group kukiz ' 15 . 
  they currently have around 10-13 % support and are considered the only possible ally of pis ( the rest of the opposition always criticizes pis ) . 
  one of the main election promises of kukiz '' 15 was to change the constitution , so pis trying to do this is a nod in their direction . 
  give him a moment and he will be speaking russian like the best of em - cyka blyat !, 
  thanks for the info , i appreciate the insight , however i totally disagree with your conclusion `` as one can see , my summary was pretty accurate . '' . 
  this was your summary :  czech republic refused everything . 
  this isnt and afaik there arent any examples of the eu or specific country ( like greece ) requesting any form of aid ( other than just taking in migrants ) and czech refusing it . 
   the oficial position is `` we do n't care what happens outside the borders , just close them '' . 
  your own last 2 points disprove this :  * help to lebanon , turkey and jordan to arrange better conditions in their refugee camps  * solving of the syrian conflict with russia and usa about the last part :  solving something is the last one , and basically contains nothing but `` let others solve it '' we can discuss how much czech republic ( or any other country for that matter ) is doing to solve this crisis , but the fact is , it is not ( just ) czech republic 's job to solve this . 
  dont expect a single country to singlehandily solve/meaningfully improve this situation . 
  you could similarly describe the eu : `` number 1 is relocate migrants , solving something is the last thing they are doing '' , basically relocate migrants and `` let others solve it '' . 
   are you going to play the fool on this until the last moment ? 
  this is such an empty statement - no matter how ridiculous of a thing i predict , treat it seriously or it will be to late if it happens . 
  ive seen people talk like this about so many idiotic predictions , even stuff like : pis will soon order the police to shoot at protesters . 
   you have a government often listed alongside russia and turkey and thats the problem , anyone who actually thinks poland is like russia/turkey has no clue what is going on in poland or is deliberately lying . 
  to early to tell , but either way pis doesnt have the votes to change the constitution , so dont expect any wacky changes . 
   i think the constitution absolutely needs to be changed . 
  if poland could pull of to change it with the broad co-operation it demands a lot of the legal problems they are going through could be solved . 
  totally agree  however with pis in charge i am not sure what is going to actually be proposed . 
  it doesnt really matter who currently is in power here , changing the constitution requires 2/3 votes in parliament . 
  neither group has that and will need votes from the other side . 
  sadly i think this will purely be a political/pr move , the chances of the government and opposition reaching a compromise in any important matter is slim to none . 
  mind providing any sources of this ? 
  not saying it didnt happen , but i only recall their refusal of taking in migrants , not any other form of aid .
