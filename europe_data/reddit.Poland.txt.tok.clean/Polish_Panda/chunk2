  the question is if the incident happened , not if they were there or if they tried to talk to the the police ( both sides confirm that ) . 
   missing cctv footage does not proof much . 
  it depends , if i say in front of store x , y happened and you check a cctv camera that shows the area in front of store x and you dont see y happening - that proves y didnt happen . 
  that being said - is this as clear cut as that , probably not , but we dont know . 
   only that the dude was not stupid enough to attack in a place with camera surveillance . 
  come on , if this happened , you are giving this idiot way too much credit , is he a spitting mastermind ? 
  fair enough , i misunderstood your previous comment . 
  it looked like you were saying `` this ( situation ) is no lie , you guys dont get it '' . 
  not at all , the relationship between eu/poland and poland/wroclaw are not the same . 
  wow , you certainly get around to know about 100 000 people , do tell ... 
  everyone is equal , but some are equal-er . 
  i agree , but then why did you say in your previous post `` this is no lie . '' ? 
  you are the one that stated with 100 % confidence this happened , not me . 
  you mean like the muslim girls words ? 
  how do you know its not a lie ? 
  because it suits whatever you want to believe about poland ? 
  those 2 statements in no way are inconsistency . 
  so everything the police say is a lie now ? 
  not technically a tourist , but during a student exchange programme in the early 2000 - `` wow , so you guys have tvs ? '', 
  such as ? 
  there is no point discussing with you , if you truly believe anything is free in business and politics . 
  dont forget that they are giving out money out of the goodness of their heart , no strings attached , non whatsoever ... 
  such a beautiful place , ive been there once and would love to go again . 
  thats a good question . 
  my first thought was a doctor might not want to prescribe it `` just in case '' , since it is not suppose to be used as a regular birth control pill , it is an emergency contraception . 
  they are also not as effective ( [ source ] ( http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/eceffect.html ) ) :  ** they are not as good at preventing pregnancy as birth control that 's used before or during sex , like the pill or condom . 
  ** but i cant think of a reason why the doctor wouldnt ( as long as it is `` just in case '' , not as a regular birth control method ) , so you have a `` back up plan '' in case something happens ( rubber breaks , forget to take the pill , etc ) . 
  that being said , i am not a doctor or a morning after pill expert in any way , this is just my educated guess . 
  this does not really answer austinvonrivia question . 
  these are actually reasons why someone might want to do this - `` prepare '' early , when you are not in a rush to get to a doctor . 
  that doesnt make sense with what you said before , you clearly stated  v4 will never be reasonable . 
  it would be something different if they were against it in the first place before the voting took place . 
  they were against it in the first place -  it is something different -  they are reasonable or at least they have the potential to be reasonable ( which is an odd thing to point out ) . 
   but they were the minorities . 
  this did n't have veto power i presume . 
  yes , but you are singling out v4 for not being reasonable , when in fact they are the ones fulfilling your criteria ( being against it and not voting for it ) , unlike most of the eu . 
   v4 will never be reasonable . 
  it would be something different ** if they were against it in the first place before the voting took place . 
  ** so i pointed out - they were against it . 
  one a lot more than others , hint `` glasses '' , 
  yes , but thats beside the point . 
  joeflux asked why they voted for it , i pointed out they ( 3/4 ) didnt + poland voted yes , but imo our old government would have followed through with it ( therefor not a lack of consistency ) . 
  [ they ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34331126 ) were ( mostly ) against it : `` but romania , the ** czech republic ** , ** slovakia ** and ** hungary ** voted against accepting mandatory quotas . '', 
  poland was the only v4 country that broke out of this and voted yes . 
  i genuinely believe that if the previous government ( that voted `` yes '' ) was still in power , we would have taken in the migrants . 
  that says more about you than him , mate . 
  several reasons : political pressure , pragmatism ( knew migrants wouldnt stay in their country anyways ) , etc. 
  iirc hungary , czech republic and slovakia ( not 100 % about them ) didnt vote for this , so its not a surprise they refused . 
  in case of poland , this isnt something i can prove , but i genuinely believe that our previous government that voted for this , would have taken in the migrants . 
  dont forget about 2 year state of emergency . 
  macron is targeting the visegrad group ( a cultural and political alliance of ** four central european states ** ) . 
  i think the key part is `` voluntary '' . 
  you freely decided to do so and you followed through - good on you . 
  out of curiosity , what do norwegians think of the migrant quotas ? 
  ill just leave [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kgqf5rvpy0 ) here , 
  its not only the v4 . 
  the 2 year migrant quota programme ends in a couple months and only about 15 % migrants have been resettled . 
  that shows it is a much wider issue , not only v4 . 
  but hey , lets focus on the ** e ** vil ** e ** ast . 
  and poland being in the eu is ultimately very beneficial for other eu countries , if it wasnt - we never would have gotten the chance to join . 
  you obviously have no idea what you are talking about . 
  this is the last time i try to explain things to you . 
   the only thing that changes is avoiding situations where teenage girls buy and take few such pills per month . 
  this is n't sugar , you know ? 
  his meaning is very clear . 
  we should avoid situations , where young girls over use these pills , because that is dangerous . 
  it ** isnt ** like sugar , because if young girls took sugar pills every day nothing would happen . 
  the morning after pill is an ** emergency contraception pill ** and should not be used as regular birth control , you most likely wont believe me , so ask your doctor the next time you see them . 
  wrong , you completely missed his point . 
  he said it isnt sugar , because it has side effects and if misused is dangerous . 
  if you take a `` sugar pill '' every day , nothing will happen , hence `` morning after pill isnt sugar '' . 
   2 . yes you did one bad thing with another . 
  no clue what that means . 
   it is relevant . 
  it is not . 
  thats pure whataboutism , thats like saying , kids can get alcohol so lets not stop them from getting cocaine . 
  just because they have unlimited access to one bad thing ( aspirin ) doesnt mean they should have unlimited access to another ( morning after pill ) . 
   there is nothing wrong with an anti-conception pill being otc . 
  the morning after pill ** is not ** an anti-contraception pill and should not be used as one . 
  that is when it is dangerous . 
  your type of thinking is the exact reason it should not be otc . 
  but ... but ... populism ... 
  bs , you cant make it any more clear than saying - it ** isnt ** sugar . 
  did i say that ? 
  more importantly , the morning after pill is a emergency contraception and it should not be used as a regular birth control pill . 
  it is a bad thing ( dangerous ) when abused . 
  again , completely irrelevant . 
  so what that aspirin ( and other meds ) are also being over used - two wrongs dont make a right . 
  that is a completely different discussion to have , how to prevent stuff like aspirin being mis-used . 
  [ typical `` racja mojsza ni\u017c twojsza '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snkzgn_xivs ) . 
  for non-polish speakers . 
  scene from a old polish comedy , that points out the absurdity of politics . 
  different politicians `` debating '' . 
  each one saying essentially `` there is only one truth , my truth '' , `` even if the truth belongs to you , it still belongs to me more '' . 
  for the sake of argument . 
   and the fact you compared the pill to `` sugar '' he didnt , he quite clearly wrote : `` this ** is n't ** sugar , you know ? '', 
   in poland , the uneducated kids have access to pseudometh `` dopalacze '' , e-cigarettes , alcohol , whataboutism , just because they have access to bad things , doesnt mean they should have access to other bad things . 
  that being said , i disagree with this new law , imo making it `` behind-the-counter '' is a much better solution . 
  it wont stop people from getting it in time ( thats the major issue of having to go to the doctor for a prescription ) , but it will help educate and prevent it being overused - dangerous ( he rightfully pointed out that this does happen ) . 
   you somehow think your country is exploited by the eu and it would be some kind of superpower without it .
