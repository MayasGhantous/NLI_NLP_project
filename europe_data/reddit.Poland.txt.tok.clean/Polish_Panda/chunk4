  why ? 
  oh who cares about those pesky details ... 
  i meant politically , as in gain x new young voters , lose y old voters . 
  is x  y and are the new voters `` reliable '' ( young people probably change who they vote for more often than older people ) . 
  also , i remember pis wanting to just import it , dont know if their thinking changed , but i hope so . 
  to me ( admittedly im not an expert in this field in any way ) that doesnt make much sense . 
  agreed . 
  of course , but the question is : would it be worth it ? 
  they would gain some young voters ( which most likely would be less `` reliable '' - more likely to change their voting preferences ) , but could lose part of their older electorate that is strongly against legalizing it completely . 
  this probably will change with how people see marijuana in general , but that will take several years . 
  i havent really looked into this topic much , but i think it probably would hurt `` normal '' parties ( like pis , po or even n ) more than it would help them . 
  unfortunately i dont recall any proper polls about this , but i think the support for total legalization is a lot lower . 
  while i agree they are doing this for political reasons ( young voters , targeting kukiz15 , korwin , etc ) , but come on - drug addicts ? 
  the vast majority of people support this ( poll from january : 78 % agree , only 6 % disagree ) . 
  you dont have to be a drug addict to think this is a good idea . 
  the `` good old days '' when everyone was a millionaire . 
  finally , all it took was a rapper in our parliament to make this happen . 
   wonder how long will it take to legalize cannabis , period . 
  very , its not going to happen under pis , i highly doubt po+n would either if they win in the next elections . 
   ehm , that is what i said , did you ? 
  i might have misunderstood , but you said :  but what about the mother that kills a tyrannical father who threatens to kill the son when he sees him again ? 
  ** the wording fit ** , the ruling would be unjust . 
  my point was - it doesnt fit the wording of murder , therefor its not a good example . 
  i agree with what you are saying , but practically speaking , the more vauge the law and the more left for interpretation , the more chances of abuse . 
  of course someone can later on fight that in court , but the damage has already been done . 
  additionally site like fb , twitter , etc. 
  will get rid of more and more posts `` just in case '' . 
   each law can be redicioulus . 
  theft is difined in germany as taking something that is posession of someone else and is punishable by up to five years in prison . 
  the wording includes when i steal a lollipop from a baby . 
  murder is , among other things , always given , when i kill someone in his sleep , but what about the mother that kills a tyrannical father who threatens to kill the son when he sees him again ? 
  the wording fit , the ruling would be unjust . 
  that is why , when you actually look at the cases , that every law read without sense and understanding can be ridiculed . 
  but in the example you gave - '' mother that kills a tyrannical father who threatens to kill the son when he sees him again '' does not fit the legal definition of murder - i would give the definition here to prove that , but there is no universal definition ( different countries , different laws , different definitions ) . 
  also killing is often divided into sections ( murder , manslaughter , etc ) with clear boundaries . 
   and by the way , fundamental rights are always discussion . 
  in germany , the first draft of art . 
  2 i gg was basically `` every human can do whatever they want '' and the changes to `` are free to develop their personality freely '' was done , as you can see in the documents of the draft of the constitution , only to make it sound better . 
  yes , im not saying that is a necessarily bad thing , just that when times change ( growth of social media ) , the laws change with it ( saying certain things online becomes illegal ) and its best to make sure , that those changes are in the right direction ( not censorship , not interpreting the law for other - sometimes political - reasons , etc ) . 
  times are much different now , as / u/stardate _ 94262-92 pointed out , social media have drastically changed the circumstances . 
  slippery slope doesnt mean that you turned into a totalitarian shithole , just that with times changing , its best to keep an eye out for how the government changes with it . 
  imo blindly trusting people in power and saying `` everything is fine '' without looking into it , is just wrong . 
   every law sounds redicioulus if you take it on its own without any further system to back it up not really , many laws are very straightforward - this specific action is illegal ( no room for interpretation on the action ) . 
   this law is , due to being restrictive of a fundamental right of democracy , widly discussed by the constitutional court and has to be read restrictive and in the thight boundaries the constitutional court set for it . 
  thats the thing though , it is `` wildly discussed '' that means there is a certain level of interpretation allowed and when its about a fundamental right , that ** can ** be dangerous . 
   every step outside of these boundaries ( you do n't read in the text of the law ) by the government makes their action unconstitutional , and thus , the law not applicable for these cases . 
  but there are no specific boundaries , as mentioned before - there is a certain level of interpretation/discussion . 
  the constitution court can not go through each case ( not just these 36 ) and decide which post is ok and which isnt . 
   i said all 36 were incitement , harassment or threats . 
  which is factually correct . 
  no , you didnt . 
  here is a quote from your first post this all started from : `` all of the people in question made violent threats though . '', 
  stop lying . 
   jesus christ , buddy . 
  even for / r/europe standards you are thick . 
  yeah ... ad personam isnt going to win you an argument . 
  so far you : * lied ( `` all were threats '' ) * kept switching your story ( started with `` all threats '' then switched back and forth a couple times with `` all threats ... or harassment or incitement '' ) * had problems reading and understanding ( `` one person accused of making threats or harassment based on someone 's sexual orientation '' = all 36 ) * made claims without any source ( `` in this case probably had hopes that they would find proof that the gents in question are not just inciting , but are actually planning or doing some arson/terrorist stuff themselves . '' ), 
  but im the thick one ... suuuuure . 
  fair enough . 
  but isnt the movement illegal because of the ideology ? 
  i dont understand what you mean by that . 
   that would already depend on the case , because the whole point is whether what was actually said can also count as incitement . 
  well , since it fits the legal parameters , i dont see why not . 
   yes , only 36 where they had a good chance to prove that it was meant as incitement and in this case probably had hopes that they would find proof that the gents in question are not just inciting , but are actually planning or doing some arson/terrorist stuff themselves . 
  it 's similiar to how they raided the members of a specific facebook group and found proof of them taking the action into their own hands . 
  there are probably plenty of other cases , the vast majority actually , where it was more of an insult . 
  where are you getting this from ? 
  im guessing that just like with `` all were threats '' you are just making things up to `` strengthen '' your argument ...  why do you think they would only go for 36 and not for all or the majority reported to them ? 
  i dont know , we dont know enough about these 36 to make any conclusions . 
  it could be anything from `` what you are saying '' to `` these 36 needed to be shut down for x different reasons '' . 
   or harassment or incitement . 
  thats not what you said earlier . 
  these are 3 very different things . 
   of course they were , can you read ? 
  can you make up your damn mind ? 
  first you say : they were all threats , then : all threats ... or harassment or incitement , now they are all threats again ? 
  let me know when you finally decide ... also , better leave out the `` can you read '' comment , so far you are the one with reading problems : you thought/think this : `` most of the raids concerned politically motivated right-wing incitement , according to the federal criminal police office , whose officers conducted home searches and interrogations . 
  but the raids also targeted two people accused of left-wing extremist content , as well as ** one person accused of making threats or harassment based on someone 's sexual orientation . 
  ** '' ... means all 36 were threats . 
   does n't exsist . 
  incitement always implies an actual action ie . 
  violence ...  incitement can be racist hate speech , but `` racist hate speech '' is not a legal term in germany anyway and therefore not illegal . 
  the german term is `` volksverhetzung '' which is incitement and which by definition implies that someone is trying to get someone else to do something . 
  ill just leave this here : volkserhetzung , the official english translation of the german criminal code uses ** `` incitement to hatred '' ** , is a concept in german criminal law that refers to ** incitement to hatred ** against segments of the population and refers to calls for violent or arbitrary measures against them , including assaults against the human dignity of others ** by insulting , maliciously maligning , or defaming segments of the population ** . 
   well you implied they were raiding homes of people who did n't do anything illegal under german law . 
  i clearly stated in my first post , we simply dont know what specifically the raids were for . 
  i would like more information . 
  me refuting your lie that `` all were threats '' does not imply anything like that . 
  add to that , incitement is a wide term and can refer to many things . 
  afaik they cant show/do anything connected to that ideology - `` heil '' , use the swastika , etc. 
  why ? 
  because that ideology is illegal . 
  just to be clear , you agree , racist insults can be treated as incitement ? 
   also you need the intention to insult someone . 
  not really , people are insulted over different things , its very subjective . 
  if you said a `` dumb pollack '' joke , not because you wanted to insult someone , but you genuinely thought it was funny , that doesnt change the fact that some people will laugh , others will be insulted . 
  you cant really tell someone not to be offended by something . 
   but the whole point of incitement is to rile people up . 
  when you talk about people being cockroaches that need to be decimated that may on the one hand be an insult , but more importantly it 's also incitement . 
  thats clearly more than just an insult .
