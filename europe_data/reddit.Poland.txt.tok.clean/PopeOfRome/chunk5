  when we joined eu , all criminals from my city went to uk . 
  and trust me they were worst kind of people . 
  when they left , our security increased immediately . 
  and this is something i experienced personally . 
  from the point where i was scared to leave my house in the evening , to the point where we could stay whole night outside without fear of being robbed or beaten . 
  also my friend in police said that between 2004 and 2008 burglary cases dropped dramatically . 
  that 's just one small city . 
  that 's very interesting stroy . 
  thank you  i do n't understand how anyone can be mad about someone 's family . 
  does it really matter who was your father or grandfather ? 
  you should take responsibility only for you actions . 
  it 's too sweet for me . 
  i ate large pizza . 
   but on the contrary , what would you say if a public school put half moons up in the classrooms ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  same with star of david , cross or anything else . 
  i never understood why people have problem with cross or any other symbol . 
  as atheist i feel nothing when i see the cross . 
  it 's like any other unimportant design element . 
  sometimes i think that some atheists not differ from radicals . 
  they fight every sign of different ideology just to prove that they know better . 
  i 'm not saying that we should kick him from hospital ( i was n't clear ) . 
  i said that he should pay for his treatment after he is cured from disease that he refused to be vaccinate against ( if he skipped free vaccination ) . 
  it 's time to make it serious . 
  it 's not only about their health . 
  there are people that ca n't be vaccinated due to diseases or being too young . 
  they are safe now , because community is immune . 
  what is going to happened to newborns when dangerous diseases will become common again ? 
  older child can easily handle a lot of infections , but newborn will die . 
   or void your medical insurance . 
  maybe it should . 
  its free choice . 
  you can be part of our system , respect vaccination rules , or you are out . 
  it 's like with car insurance . 
  if you caused an accident and you were drunk , you wo n't get money for you car even if it was insured . 
  but there are more examples similar to kosovo . 
  abkhazia or `` novorossia '' ( i hate this name ) . 
  russia clearly has imperial ambitions . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that we have to look from russians or serbians perspective , to understand what they feel . 
  i 'm sure they feel the same thing about kosovo , we feel about abkhazia , crimea , novorossia . 
  i 'm not defending them , i 'm just trying to understand . 
  you seems to not understand the core of my utterance . 
  instead of crimea , we can get abkhazia . 
  russian intervention without annexation . 
  any difference ? 
  or so called novorossia ... 
  the only difference is who is trying to intervene . 
  we are scared of russia , and we are scared of their imperial politics . 
  that 's why we support kosovo , and condemn russian interventions wherever they annex or release states . 
  if we want to be clear , there was nato intervention in serbia/kosovo . 
  in fact there is no much difference between kosovo/bosnia and crimea/abkhazia . 
  we have to face the truth that we support one secession , and condemn another . 
  we must also admit , that the only reason we do that , is because we feel threatened by russia . 
  we do n't condemn kosovo independence by the same reason russians support crimea/abkhazia - it was their intervention , they feel it was `` right '' to do this . 
  kosovo intervention was our , it was supported by our politicians so we were right in our opinion . 
  i 'm not trying to judge what is right , but you have to take into consideration that two people will draw different conclusions looking at the same situation . 
  i 've been there so many times from 90 's to 2015 , because i have family in kaliningrad oblast . 
  unfortunately / u/hipokryzja is right . 
  there is absolutely beautiful railway station ( since 2003 if i remember correctly ) , and frightfully ugly bus station next to it , where you ca n't even find toilet ( well , there is ... hole in the ground with shit on the floor ) . 
  it perfectly describes the whole city . 
  and there are more cities like this in example sovetsk . 
  i love this city , because there are places in old town , where you can literally forget that you are in russia . 
  then you turn back your head and you see large [ lenin monument .

   the cherry on top is when the game is locked to russian language only . 
  what the f. . ? 
  i love this [ top 1 % argument .

  [ i do n't want to write the same things twice so i 'll link my response to another msg . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5mxcjc/polish_cities_provide_free_public_transport_due/dc8jlet/ ), 
  i 'm counting only raw fuel cost for such distance . 
  i 'm not counting other costs because i need car anyway for other things like shopping etc. 
  so no matter what kind of transport type i 'd choose , i 'll pay for all these things . 
  now raw fuel costs : 9.5 km from home to my workplace so about 20km per day . 
  i 'm programmer and few days in month i work from my home , so i have like 15-20 working days . 
  but i 'll count worst-case scenario - 20 days . 
  it 's 400km per month . 
  i have rather new car so i can easily make 6-7l / 100 with eco-driving . 
  fuel costs about 4.50-5pln which means 400km costs 100-150 pln . 
  my example . 
  i drive to work 20 minutes by car . 
  it takes another 20 to go back to home . 
  when i use public transport , i spent 2 hours in buses . 
  now the best part . 
  monthly pass costs 100 pln . 
  i pay exactly the same for the fuel ( if not less ) . 
  is there any reason to use public transport in my case ? 
  tell that to young boys who joined guerrilla warfare when germany attacked my country in 1939 . 
  some of them are still alive . 
  you can ask them why they killed and committed violence . 
  we are under attack . 
  we know our enemy and we are loosing this battle . 
  whole europe , different countries , nationalities , religions are in danger . 
  i 'm afraid that sooner or later radical movements will take control over europe and turn against minorities . 
  better fight real enemy in the source of the problem before we find imaginary problem here in europe . 
  unfortunately you are right . 
  he was shot . 
  i ca n't believe it . 
  i visited berlin christmas market so many times . 
  i wanted to go this year too .
