  maybe time to tone down a notch and stop acting like teasing you is teasing all france . 
  not everyone lives in rural french village without internet , ya know ? 
  i 'm curious how the polls were conducted . 
  for sure methods in 1945 and in 1994 were different , is this accounted for or not ? 
  yeah i always liked argument `` cant make taxes higher bcoz business will run away '' . 
  obviously we should get our taxes to 0 % in this case . 
  according to imf low development of financial sector is bad for economy because you can not get credit for starting or continuing a business . 
  if it is overdeveloped it 's bad because as i understand it starts serving itself rather than the economy by introducing some weird financial instruments ( hedge funds etc. ), 
  that have higher return rate so people like to put their money there but do n't lead to actual growth . 
  also they mention some social factors like draining smart people from other branches etc. 
  basically it becomes cancerous . 
  yes , thank you . 
  haha i guess so , me being first example . 
  source and deeper explanation : http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1508.pdf ( graph is on page 16 ) . 
  one of the contributions for good polish economic results lately . 
   millions of poles that have emigrated in the last 10 years would definitely agree with the ruined part . 
  about 2 millions migrated after opening job markets and since then this number is stable . 
  this is not good of course , i agree but i dont know if it was possible to stop it at all . 
   proof is that out of all presidential candidates , not even one has the faintest marks of a true statesman because president 's power in poland is a joke and everyone knows that . 
  elections of president are just muscle-flexing for parties before parliamentary elections . 
  ~ ~ yeah although i 've read they are pro-russian which bothers me . 
  also the leader is n't the best one , but we will see . ~ ~ edit : i derped , mornings are hard . 
  goodness indicator = ( ihdi * amount of bigmacks you can buy with average salary * internet speed ) / ( child mortality rate * amount of parliamentarists * taxes ) yeah , something like this . 
   independant independent from logic i presume ? 
  while gdp of course its not the only parameter , it is still important . 
  you know those money are there so that western companies would have access to polish market ? 
  so it 's not like it works only for poland . 
  i do n't know why people see it as free money , it is an investment and if western governments fail to capitalize on their investment then , well , what can i say . 
  does n't matter , government steals from people and our politicians are the worst !, 
   after all taxes family in uk will have enough money to buy all necessities pay rent and so on without problem and still have money for some luxury item/time yes but this is simply the effect of them being richer , i have never stated that `` polish taxes are low so people can buy more '' . 
   this is no longer case for polish family where after taxation families need to shoestring their budget till next payday . 
  point of welfare state is exactly to help those people getting education they cant afford and stability to find best job suitable for them so their full potential can be used . 
   taxation in % is the same but overall repercussions are completely different . 
  i am fully aware of that , but that 's missing the point . 
   taxation is prime reason for this . 
  people keep repeating this in internet but i have yet to see any data supporting that . 
   sure there are people who managed to get out of minimal wage hell but overall most of polish families are ~ in minimal wage territory which means again that they should n't pay so much taxes because it eats into their living standards and people simply run away from it . 
  and lowering taxes , decreasing government spending serves always the richest , history has shown that . 
  unless we are talking about highering tax exempted income threshold which is socialdemocratic policy i agree fully with . 
  but that 's exactly what higher taxation for richer would balance out . 
   those 2mln poles probably wo n't come back and if you can count 2mln is amount that is worth more than 10 % or 20 % tax reduction that would possibly keep them in country . 
  it would maybe keep some of them . 
  or maybe even more would leave because public services would be worse . 
  this is pure speculation based on no data . 
  hard to refute such claims . 
   i like how you just discarded whole austrian economic with one sentence . 
  no i did not . 
  last year maybe because they are coming back from negative gdp growth . 
   you just directly contradicted yourself . 
  no , i just provided you additional data . 
  of course , people in poland believe we pay extremely high taxes . 
  hence the candidates answer as shown on the picture . 
  edit : i even get downvoted for stating the obvious , this is really funny discussion going on . 
  i mean come on people think that , why would you downvote me . 
  i guess i should not be surprised after i try to provide some data and facts everywhere in this thread and get downvoted by `` hurr durr lower taxes '' brigade . 
   you emigrated to a country with much lower taxes than poland , but you want to make the situation in your home country even worse than it already is . 
  nah , im not gon na bother refuting this . 
  this is too funny . 
   you just ignored that and spew some unsourced bullshit about eurostat/oecd . 
  because i assumed if i cite those names you can do simple google search but apparently no , so here it is for you : http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/gen_info/economic_analysis/tax_structures/2014/pr_92-2014_en.pdf page 2 , tax revenue as % of gdp ( 2012 ) poland 32,5 % , czech republic 35 % , france 45 % , germany 39,1 % , not gon na cite the rest you can see for yourself . 
  page 3 tells as similar story about implicit tax rates . 
  anyway you can see more data supporting my point here : http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/gen_info/economic_analysis/tax_structures/index_en.htm here you can see corporate tax rates : http://economic-incentives.blogspot.fr/2013/04/corporate-tax-revenues.html surprise , surprise , poland is well below the average . 
  i could throw at you even more data but apparently your `` wage calculator '' is the only source you trust for some reason . 
   ok i see you 're one of those types who ignores arguments and just repeats . 
  i still wait for data that would support your point of high taxes . 
  data . 
  numbers . 
  anything . 
   you prefer living in poverty as long as everyone is also poor , instead of living a well-off life with many rich people around , so you concentrate on taking others down to your level . 
  that 's the most hilarious thing i have ever heard concerning my stance on economy . 
  well done , bravo . 
   have fun paying 50 % in taxes and being treated like shit in return . 
  yeah i 'm having such fun in france right now , thanks . 
   the taxes to gdp are relatively low because they are so high individually lol wat ? 
  i 'm talking about % figures , both income and corporate taxes are one of the lowest in europe  low wages are because of high taxes . 
   houses would be cheaper if not for 2 % transaction tax . 
  ohh and i thought its because we have one of the lowest amount of houses per capita in europe due to zero amount of communal housing . 
   this enormous tax has a very far reaching repercussions , because most businesses start small , and for that you need savings . 
  you are aware of the fact that poland has much higher amount of companies per capita than healthy western economies ? 
   poland would be much , much richer if it had low taxation for the last 25 years , especially because the emigration would be much lower , in a positive feedback loop . 
  that 's simply wishful thinking with neither economical or historical evidence . 
   what ? 
  almost everyone does it . 
  even if they do n't get a part of the paycheck under the table , they buy smuggled cigarettes , alcohol and often fuel . 
  oh god , please do not assume everyone is like you . 
  the fact that you or your close friends do that says nothing about general society . 
  yes it 's easy to buy , so what . 
   total taxes in poland are already ridiculously high for everyone . 
  according to what data ? 
  because certainly not oecd or eurostat  they are the main reason for a very high brain drain , i always thought it 's because of low wages and no social benefit net that would allow for having a family  because the only way to prosper is to either evade taxes ( risky , complicated and limited in scope ) or emigrate . 
  did you just insult all the hard-working people in poland that get by without dodging taxes ? 
   scandinavian countries were already one of the richest countries in europe before ww2 , especially sweden and denmark . 
  even finland , the poorest of them , was on the level of austria . 
  [ not according to data ] ( http://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0cciqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.researchgate.net%2fprofile%2falexander_klein6%2fpublication%2f237210850_aggregate_and_per_capita_gdp_in_europe_1870-2000_continental_regional_and_national_data_with_changing_boundaries%2flinks%2f02e7e52ef6f842b5ce000000.pdf&amp;ei=e7hdvfaujyi3uzqagfgm&amp;usg=afqjcnhdrb7eoyok1gmz0su2k7wmt_h1gw&amp;bvm=bv.92291466,d.d24&amp;cad=rja ) from table3 . 
  on page 20 gdp per capita in 1913 was finland : 2,288 sweden : 2,806 norway : 2,454 denmark : 3,768 whereas uk : 5,030 germany : 4,181 belgium : 4,263 netherlands : 3,539 france : 3,245 if you check then data for 1950 you can see how much they improved thanks to their policies and despite war . 
   as long as there is no totalitarian authority ruling whole world with an iron fist , there always will be tax havens . 
  i see , you simply lack imagination , its either laissez-faire or authoritatianism , come on . 
   pehrhaps because it 's not really relevant to our current situation perhaps it is  by a negligible ammount . 
  actually , such move would n't have any effects other that you could pat backs of your likeminded buddies how `` those rich cunts totally got what they deserved '' . 
  i like how you just discarded whole keynesian economic with one sentence .
