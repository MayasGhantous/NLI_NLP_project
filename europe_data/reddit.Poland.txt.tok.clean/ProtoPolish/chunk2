  and those who actually know something about politics vote either for korwin or some smaller leftist parties . 
  the ones who downvote this guy propably never lived in poland . 
  he promised to reduce taxes , he increased them . 
  he promised to reduce the number of officials , there are a lot more now . 
  he promised that poles would come back from emigration - millions left . 
  before his election he said he was libertarian ( that 's how he won it the first time ) later - that he is a social democrat . 
  he also said that he is ** not polish ** but kashubian . 
  he is a lying piece of shit who escaped this country as soon as he got the option . 
  why not ? 
  it 's fun, 
  he chose the lesser evil . 
  either he would invade ukraine or russia would border nato from a strategically important direction, 
  awful . 
  putin is a bad man , but a pretty good president for russia . 
  he also seems quite responsible . 
  would you prefer zhyrinovsky or however it is written ? 
  which african empires, 
  every time i see such maps i am ashamed that polamd fucked up so much in the xviii century . 
  from the largest force in europe to nothing . 
  we could 've colonized africa : (, 
  my grandfather , when he was still alive , always used a pitchfork when they came close to his house trying to sell ( steal ) something . 
  worked perfectly , but it was n't very handy . 
  sorry , but ... kurwa jego ma\u0107 nosz ja pierdole, 
  / u/protopolish , obviously . 
  i would prefer paying for bigger orphanages than for abortions , you know /, 
  i 'm not saying this is a general problem with society . 
  i 'm saying that we ca n't tolerate such stuff . 
  it 's true . 
  yes , that to . 
  but at least with heterosexual couples , this does make some sense since they can have children . 
  feminists ? 
  there have been cases became pregnant on purpose just to have an abortion and brag about it, 
  i do not oppose homo marriage . 
  in fact , with the current system , i do support some form of civil union for homos . 
  i just believe they should n't receive any tax benefits . 
  and also that the state should n't even care about who is married with who . 
  more like `` i am a libertarian who believes marriage should n't be handled by the state and also that abortion should n't be promoted . 
  my comment here would be very offensive , but i wo n't post it because i do n't want to get banned . 
  but you can imagine what words i would use . 
  nobody really cares about ukraine . 
  the western countries panicked because they are afraid nato would get attacked . 
  i 'm sorry , but it 's true . 
  ukraine does n't matter . 
  r/europe . 
  jk , it 's awesome, 
  the polish government recently `` invested '' 2 million into gypsies , to find them jobs . 
  result ? 
  not a single one of them found a job, 
  why do you want him to die ? 
  what is mister ? 
  `` green europe '', 
  it 's not about borders . 
  it 's about people . 
  men are meant to defend the women and children . 
  if you would run away , you 're not a man . 
  towards romanians , completely neutral . 
  towards gypsies , extremely negative . 
  i have met a lot of them , and none were likeable . 
  better a living ~ ~ citizen ~ ~ ** human ** than a dead hero, 
  post soviet ? 
  oh and i wo n't be rambo . 
  i will be the terminator, 
  so basically you are proud of being a pussy . 
  well , i thought this sub was about politics . 
  lol, 
  and here we can see a typical russophobe . 
  i love how the us is becoming increasingly leftist while europe starts to think . 
  good luck national front !, 
  i also saw this documentary about whole gypsy villages in slovakia . 
  they are awful . 
  i mean , they do exist in poland too , but there is way fewer of them compared to how big poland is . 
  yes , i do agree there are infectious diseases . 
  socialism , for example , is a terrible disease which is being spread mostly through a bacteria called public education pubic healthcare etc recommended treatments : quarantine, 
  did n't realize health was public . 
  is my health public too ? 
  i wo n't ask about yours , because it obviously is n't since i do n't care about it . 
  i feel really sorry for romanians . 
  people hate them because they confuse them with gypsies . 
  jes jes weri gud weri gud frends, 
  lithuania . 
  because we were one country and because gib wilno, 
  i did n't expect that ... every single person i know does have running water . 
  i guess it 's way worse in polen b, 
  for , how is it even possible that an european country does n't have running water in its rural areas ... 
  i love this . 
  completely ignoring what i wrote . 
  typical skypl, 
  [ i did my best ... 
  polan !, 
  honestly i do not understand your point . 
  no , that was what allowed them to annex us . 
  what led them to attack us was hitler 's sick nazism . 
  if being stronger would be the only reason , why did n't we invade the czech republic , slovakia , lithuania , latvia , estonia and ukraine yet ? 
  not true . 
  the crimean parliament which was elected while crimea was still under ukrainian occupation unanimously voted for joining russia . 
  crimea democratically decided that they want to leave ukraine and join russia . 
  hehe . 
  do you support lgbt pride parades ? 
  it absolutely does n't change the fact that lviv was built by poles , for poles , and forcefully taken away . 
  either gib back geld or leave the city .
