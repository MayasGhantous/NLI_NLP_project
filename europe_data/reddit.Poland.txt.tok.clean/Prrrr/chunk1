it works pretty well for all 28 members . 
  and krakow is far worse than wroclaw . 
  ^ but ^ it 's ^ still ^ worth ^ to ^ visit ^ them ^ all . 
  i would n't expect that - `` not angering russia '' would anger polish electorate . 
  poles generally do n't give a fuck about russia , but recent russian actions are taken seriously here ( but kremlin 's cold war rhetoric is viewed as ridiculous , because economy of russia is worth less than 5 % of eu+us ) . 
  my first impression - brad pitt from inglorious basterds, 
  oh shit , tiny poland assembles 5x more cars than russia . 
  lol, 
  in other words - money transfers inside eu are cheap , fast and standardized now . 
  this is huge step in the integration of eu economy . 
  i also recommend georgian wines . 
  maybe there 's cunning russian plan - they want to increase alcoholism in our countries ? 
  flaki !, 
  well , it 's more like digg before demise . 
  this recording is in a way coherent with what he said at bbc : eu/pl defense should n't depend on us taxpayers . 
  well , poland is probably the most pro us country in europe , but its blind infatuation comes to an end ( there no particular reason , maybe the fact that pl feels that eu is closer ally ) . 
  btw do n't take ` fucks ' personally , check what nulad recently have said , 
  it seems that you might know something about knp plans . 
  are they willing to join any political group of ep ? 
  sorry homie but we have some `` dark pages '' in our history ( some `` recent '' ones : invasion of czechoslovakia or emigration of jews in 68 ) . 
  it can not be denied and it should be discussed openly . 
  relax . 
  these are the most exaggerated _ stereotypes _ . 
  still it does n't diminish ukrainian 's right to be self-determent . 
  you are saying it 's ok that russia can control its neighborhoods . 
  so i 'm just asking : how would you feel if it were you under ~ ~ russian ~ ~ anyone 's control ? 
  do you remember when russian `` sphere of interest '' contained part of germany ? 
  ddr ? 
  would you like to live in such country ? 
  nah , usa is too smart to allow this . 
  these `` refuges '' ca n't recognize and appreciate well developed and peaceful country . 
  i wonder what did they imagine and expect . 
  anyway , it 's better for finland this way . 
  high five portugal !, 
  you are right . 
  `` extortion '' is a better word . 
  remember : when the shit goes down you can always flee to catholic poland , 
  i 'm not a fan of orban , but he 's the only eu politician that says and does what should be done in this situation . 
  he did n't placed wrongly understood political correctness over law and order in his country . 
   human rights , equality , justice , tolerance yes . 
  and people from syria , afganistan , nigeria , somalia and iraq will embrace these western values . 
  lol, 
  nah , it 's not so bad . 
  you get a good press in poland , even from pro `` culture enrichment '' outlets . 
  that 's the first thing that i thought . 
  fix it yourself , it 's just a leak !, 
  are they expecting that someone will come and do everything instead of them ? 
  fix a tent , mop a floor and do the cleaning ? 
  it does n't require special tools or phd . 
  anyway , what else they have to do ? 
  i think `` no '' is caused by an overall mess and chaos taking place in de , fr , it . 
  we are still in shock that whole eu ( including us as well ) ca n't implement any solution . 
  eu politicians are lazy as fuck ( d. tusk and entourage ) and do n't have even an idea how to solve the situation . 
   a lot of hate from divers true . 
  i 'm a driver and i fucking hate those dickheads . 
  but before you downvote me , let me explain why : 90 % of polish cyclists do n't know traffic regulations : `` let 's fucking ride in the middle of the road , or sidewalk , or pedestrian crossing . 
  red light ? 
  it does n't apply to me . 
  should i signal turning ? 
  never ! '' . 
  additionally they have their monthly dickhead meeting : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/critical_mass_ ( cycling ), 
  with his nose !, 
  ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ i ^ ^ could n't ^ ^ help ^ ^ myself, 
  well , the fact is that polish economy is still too small . 
  i 'm 100 % pro $ , but we have to get real : adopting euro right now would be a burden for eurozone and us . 
  imo eurozone should unify its fiscal policies deeper and stricter to prevent another `` greek situation '' . 
   the greeks arent getting all that money of course they do n't . 
  that 's not the point of bailout to get money to eat them away . 
  it 's just for a debt roll over and to buy time to apply reforms . 
  btw fuck you guy/girl that downvoted me because of an opinion . 
  this is 3rd bailout . 
  do you think this is easy for creditor countries ? 
  i wish greece all the best . 
  if pl were member of eurozone , i would gladly chip-in to save them . 
  but at the same time i understand german pov . 
  so what ? 
  that guy made a large pile of shit and said `` my job is done !, 
  so long , suckers ! '', 
  `` correct your numbers or we will correct you '', 
  but peaceful denmark ? 
  it 's ... confusing . 
  russia is having a serious problem with diplomacy . 
  to be more exact , they want to viewed as ant russian party , but their actions are completely opposite ( i.e. 
  deliberate damage to eu unity and pl-usa relations ) . 
  are you referring to this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/why_die_for_danzig%3f ? 
  what ? 
  yeah , you are like austria , but with cute language . 
  that 's absolutely true what you are saying . 
  the problem is that world accepted what russia did to ukraine . 
  sanctions are bypassed , business is going on as usual and money is flowing to russia . 
  i do n't want do mention denouncing because that 's a joke . 
  russians can literary do anything what they want and it will be left without any consequences . 
  this wo n't happen . 
  but business on both sides will suffer . 
  they are talking about missing sock . 
  wow , this poll does n't reflect reality at all . 
  netflix in pl has such sieved library that it is n't worth 2 $ . 
  i do n't understand why they even bother to `` enter '' polish market . 
  it reminds me ebay and yahoo , they were literally crushed by local competitors . 
  ebay 's representatives were laughed at when they said that they wanted to educate polish consumer ( allegro was way more better back then and still is ) .
