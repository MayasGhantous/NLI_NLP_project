is that stalin behind him ? 
  anarchists vs islamists ? 
  let them kill each other, 
  what a douchebag , so many people lost their jobs because of him , lol, 
  i 'm a nationalist but i kinda look forward to the idea of a european federation . 
  fuck this shit , i do n't want those criminals and chavs back in poland . 
  pls keep them, 
  what the fuck is wrong with these people ? 
  [ poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asju4y8ofkc ), 
  thanks , europe is our home and we have to fight for it , no matter if it 's warsaw , berlin , rome or paris . 
  do n't worry , even if only 1 % of the german population would be ready to defend their country and europe , it 's still 800 000 people :d not that bad , and it 's only 1 country . 
  netherland in polish is `` holandia '' lol, 
  not a surprise . 
  they probably would n't be interested even in defending germany, 
  but remember , if we fight back , they win, 
  there 's nothing wrong with european nationalism , we can be proud too, 
  make libya italian again, 
  irish language is beautiful , you should use it, 
  [ cejrowski thread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuc5mny_zeg ), 
   retirement home i ca n't understand how people could send their grandparents to a retirement home it 's not a thing in poland , or at least in my family . 
  grandparents stay in their own house to their death . 
  shit , every news about poland on / r/europe is about refugees , stop this pls, 
  yeah , rejected nationalism while praising their military and fatherland , lol . 
  it was just different kind of nationalism, 
  we can help them without smuggling them into europe . 
  i always considered descendants of european colonizators to be european, 
  where did i say it 's germany fault , lol ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5cgsdleyfo malta should have chosen this . 
  we accepted some and they ran off to germany, 
  it only helps pis . 
  now they 're hated in poland , but if europe keeps threatening us , they will be seen as defender of our nation . 
  good fucking job : /, 
  nothing, 
  this . 
  one multicultural continent is enough, 
  public institutions should not sponsor things like this . 
  but the eu is n't anti-nationalist, 
  i do n't get it, 
  world war ii was won by american industry . 
  where are you from ? 
  and democracy, 
  i respect your grandfather , i hate commies but i know that regular soldiers did n't care about politics, 
   spent 3 years at german labor camp were n't soviet prisoners of war treated like traitors by stalin ? 
  wars are n't fought only on battlefields . 
  germany never had the industrial capability to win this war . 
  the allies could produce more tanks than germany had soldiers . 
  because russian propaganda . 
  they do n't even know about the lend-lease act . 
  i always wonder why soviets in war movies use only soviet tanks , trucks , planes etc , while in reality they had thousands of tanks , cars , trucks , planes and trains from the western allies . 
  why ? 
  it 's quite simple - because people like military parades . 
  and you pacifists and anti-militarists wo n't change that . 
  of course we would exist , iii reich was already defeated when the western allies declared war . 
  it would just take a few years more, 
  lol , i always wondered why the us ca n't have military parades like in the old days , they looked glorious . 
  lol he got 5 upvotes for openly saying he 's a commie . 
  imagine if he said this . 
   i 'm a fascist . 
  well , a national-socialist to be precise . 
  western europe *, 
  democracy was bashed that day too, 
  i 've got nothing to celebrate,

  she wants a tighter cooperation between france , germany and russia , does n't she ?

  rich spoiled kids protesting against capitalist opression again ? 
  yeah , there are 2 churches not far from my house . 
  it does n't annoy me , i 'm so used to it that i do n't even notice it to be honest . 
  itt communism apologists, 
  fighting against the taliban and al-qaida is now seen as starting problems ? 
  poland liberal = conservative who loves capitalism conservative = conservative who likes capitalism,

  of course , we will leave you alone , have a good day *, 
  i heard that he harasses his employees . 
  for families, 
  it is quite massive , 500 pln for every child is a lot for a poor country like poland . 
  they 're religious , against the legalization of soft drugs , anti gay marriage , nationalist , but at the same time they 're increasing welfare and the minimum wage, 
  well , it 's quite a confusing situation , pis is conservative , socialist , pro-eu and semi-authoritarian at the same time . 
  it 's not far right , it 's just right wing . 
  and i do n't support them , they 're traitors and idiots . 
  i 'm kinda alt-right so yeah , i like trump . 
  i have a higher opinion of americans because trump, 
  that 's your opinion and by respect i mean respect,
