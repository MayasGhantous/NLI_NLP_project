  you did nothing until the france was attacked . 
  alliances dont work , if you dont keep what you promised to the ally . 
  may be , but the worst effect of the west virtually not joining the war was the soviet invasion on september 17 . 
  we would fight germans much longer , but the russians attacked from the east . 
  and they wouldnt , if they wouldnt have seen that the west abandoned their obligations . 
   always fun to see eastern europeans constantly talk shit about the west and still expect it to come running to help if eastern europe is ever in trouble . 
  i just literally said we dont . 
  what a joke . 
   i say fuck your culture . 
  and that makes you a nazi , if i can bring myself to lower to your level . 
  the rest is just laughable . 
  nato is not taking memebers `` to help them '' . 
  its an alliance , its easy to google the definition . 
  thats not true . 
  the `` alliance '' was proposed by brits and was serving their agenda only . 
  they knew that if hitler attacked the west , he would crush it ( as he later did ) , so they threw us under the bus to gain some time . 
  they promised to stand with us and didnt . 
  where do you see blaming ? 
  also , how do we ask for help ? 
  hes got union jack as a flair , i thought hes british . 
  without us you guys are nothing . 
  sorry to say that , but its the truth . 
  and in the current cultural situation , a bit of will and scotland will take you over . 
  or pakistan :p . 
  for the record : thats exactly what we in the eastern europe expect from the west . 
  there is still a chance that you guys would act honourable , as you promised , but last time you didnt , i doubt it would be different this time . 
  allies , pfff . 
  is [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kfnhxibec ) what you propose ? 
  nothing has ever been achieved by cowardice . 
  hey , its just like us , lol . 
  the world was supposed to end the next day , dont you remember ? 
  damn it . 
  you are too intelligent to have this bet with me  . 
  and thats why main stream media trust index is at 6 % . 
  '' [ wie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ) ?! '', 
  i bet there will be some whine about this soon  . 
  this year . 
  i read it was about the age too , but cant find it . 
  cant provide the source - ignore it . 
  please . 
  nobody even reports it anymore . 
  maybe for irish people . 
  english man would say this is very definition of racism  . 
  read it again . 
  its not only about ethnicity - altough i think it may be very problematic , especially if someone wants simply to have a family , not broadcasting their virtues . 
  it is only logical to assume that a family of different ethnicities or races will face more problems than `` usual '' one . 
  but the `` desire to have a child '' usually does not mean 14 year old criminal - and with this law , thats what your risk . 
  i believe the romanians will sooner emigrate to a country with more traditional approach and apply for kids there . 
  af far as i know the romanian problems with romas , this will basically stop all the adoptions . 
  keep in mind , that this process is very damaging for eastern european countries . 
  and i dont even mean depopulation , but pure cost of educating and raising those people is quite significant . 
  we cover all the expenses , the west offers better money and social policies unaffordable to us and takes over our human resources , so to speak . 
  yes , a number of emigrants send money `` home '' , but in my opinion this benefit is not justified . 
  in overall , current immigration policy hurts eastern europe . 
  im not saying im against it , as i believe certain values are more important , but bear in mind , that we didnt design it and its not beneficial to us . 
  hmm , i wonder if there is any common denominator ... 
  yeah , but why its not known in other parts of europe ? 
  why , sweden ? 
  swedish youth thinks its `` exciting '' , at least that was the reason given in yesterdays article . 
  lol . 
  i think you will find [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii#poland ) interesting . 
  if one man claims you are a donkey , laugh at him . 
  if two people do that , check your ears . 
  if three people claim that , buy yourself a saddle . 
  if you dont see difference between `` recent '' actions of russia and germany , then too bad . 
  one can never have a normal talk with russians . 
  i give you reasons why neighbours are affraid of russia , dont you see there is point in denying it ? 
  you guys just dont see consequences of your actions !, 
  im reading nowaks history now and it seems that relations were very `` normal '' until xiii century - after the east was conquered by mongols , it was a place of terrible things . 
  in my opinion the mongol invasion had huge resluts . 
  yeah , i bet crimeans are delighted , especially those who had to run . 
  russia promised to guarantee ukrainian borders if ukraine gets rid of nuclear weapons . 
  i bet their concerns then were met with `` it ` s absurd ! '' . 
  now people die there . 
  we didnt forget georgia , too . 
  be honest with yourself , you know everyone around you is affraid of you and for good reasons . 
  let me put it this way : only fools would feel safe with such a neighbour . 
  if russia would border itself , it would declare itself the biggest threat . 
  a hint : it was much different before the crimea . 
  now we are just affraid we are next . 
  as history teaches us . 
  oh , yeah , nice suits . 
  i was hoping for some huge `` bigotti '' sign on my chest  . 
  good point . 
  we know that , we are between germany and russia , lol . 
  oh , how i wish !, 
  but you are right , that was an exaggeration . 
  maybe we can get along better some day . 
  finally !, 
  we need to get along . 
  end the division between slavs !, 
  uh , i need to get some romanian ** bigotti ** clothes . 
  since , you know , we are such bigots  . 
  how many syrians among them ? 
  do you even know ? 
  if they would be real ** refugees ** , they would be happy to come here . 
  we would keep them alive . 
  but germans give them houses and cars , so ... 
  its like 3 guys  . 
  they really hate us and dont come here .
