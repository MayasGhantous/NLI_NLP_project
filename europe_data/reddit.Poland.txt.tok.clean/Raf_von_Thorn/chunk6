  we have equality now . 
  everyone has exactly the same rights . 
  what we have to lose ? 
  everything that shapes a community . 
  we are very traditional and conservative , for us to change it the way you propose would be like france accepting poliandria . 
  okay . 
  what benefit does poland receive by allowing gay marriages exactly ? 
   if there were people with expectations , regarding solidarity and so on thats also part of the game  . 
  thanks for a nice answer , i appreciate it . 
  dude . 
  thats how the things work !, 
  im curious , what would be an alternative approach ? 
  yes , and polish goverment job is to take care of its citizens . 
  as much as german or danish goverment . 
  underpaid job is better than none . 
   but your opinion is disrespectful to many people . 
  what would you recommend ? 
  to keep my opinion to myself ? 
  if thats okay , why dont you keep your sexual life for yourself ? 
  going to prague tomorrow  . 
  find yourself your own american !, 
  no worries  . 
  you have listed several countries ( like brics ) , claiming its impossible they have high sol with such political problems they have . 
  i believe its completely possible to have high sol , even if failing in some categories . 
  thanks . 
   standard of living refers to the level of wealth , comfort , material goods and necessities available to a certain socioeconomic class in a certain geographic area . 
  the standard of living includes factors such as income , quality and availability of employment , class disparity , poverty rate , quality and affordability of housing , hours of work required to purchase necessities , gross domestic product , inflation rate , amount of leisure time every year , affordable ( or free ) access to quality healthcare , quality and availability of education , life expectancy , incidence of disease , cost of goods and services , infrastructure , national economic growth , economic and ** political ** stability , ** political ** and religious freedom , environmental quality , climate and safety . 
  as you can see , politics affects only fraction of sol components . 
  let me get this straight . 
   because i have to patience for homophobic people . 
  sorry for that . 
  if your opinion is also rude to me , why ca n't i be rude to you ? 
  i have some convictions , beliefs . 
  i present those , without being rude or personal . 
  you dont like my convictions , therefore its justified to be aggresive towards me . 
  also , i dont believe i said single homophobic word in this conversation . 
  point it out , please . 
  this is the definition of [ tolerance ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tolerance ) . 
  it seems to me im the beacon of tolerance here and you dont tolerate me ( us ) or our convictions , beliefs . 
  please rethink this . 
  thank you . 
  fair enough . 
  i still think you would be surprised if you visit . 
  whats sol ? 
  i said `` it has rude '' ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  now check out your comments in this thread and count your derogational remarks and mine . 
  do you honestly think wishing me a `` happy life in vatican '' is in any way funny or clever ? 
  why do you say things like that ? 
  who said something like this ? 
  we are not gay frendly . 
  we are gay neutral , so to speak . 
  and nobody cares for your respect . 
  have a happy life !, 
  in this case its literally about hunderds of thousands polish jobs , especially in the construction and transportation . 
  what was west germany gdp before the marshall plan ? 
  no worries , poland has got unlimited respawns . 
  i like his version better . 
  then the joke is on them , as the polish girls are in uk  . 
  if the reasons i gave you are bigotry , then yes , most of us are bigots . 
  therefore it makes a norm here , right ? 
  the real question here is : does a community , a nation , has right to have its own views and feelings ( apparently defeintions too ) , or should they be dominated by global mainstream . 
  its not diversity when everyone thinks the same . 
  we are a traditional and conservative nation . 
  if thats not your taste , im sorry . 
  im glad there is a place thats better for you . 
  thats just rude and immature . 
  you will not gather any points for your case like that . 
  whats wrong with our values ? 
  what bothers you ? 
  you are mixing economy with politics and culture . 
  the report is about economy . 
   russians do n't want to touch you with a ten mile pole . 
  after ussr and `` fraternal socialist brotherhood '' failed , russians have learned their lesson to stay away . 
  google `` ukraine '' , mate . 
  who do you think we are ? 
  we wont take used ones !, 
  your children will thank you  . 
  what if we get out of this `` generational ponzi scheme '' ? 
  socialism in this shape is not possible to survive . 
  we cant just keep on growing our numbers , at some point we will run out of resources . 
  people are so closed minded that they cant even imagine another way . 
  texas is bigger than poland and only 20 milion people live there . 
  is that the newest explanation ? 
  not religious fanatics , not sharia supremacists , not even crazy people . 
  they blow up spontaneously . 
  at random . 
  the thing is , that most of us are conservatives . 
  and we think its a good direction . 
  and yes , we believe that a child is happiest with mother and father , whats naive about that ? 
  also , you didnt answer my question . 
  why do you want to hijack the term of marriage ? 
  do you realize that all you say is just pretty sentences without any solid argument ? 
  i give you reason and logic , you say `` youre stupid '' !, 
  good luck , im genuinely sorry you take it personal . 
  [ working on it ] ( https://www.polsa.gov.pl/en/ ) , 
  marriage is an thousands years old institution . 
  procreation ( and socialization ) is its most important role , but there are secondary ones ( like companionship or generally economic ) . 
  in gay `` marriage '' the secondary ones are most important ( statistically gay couples have less children than traditional ones ) . 
  therefore its completely legit to claim , that a `` gay marriage '' is simply a different thing .
