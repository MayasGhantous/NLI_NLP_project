  could have been worse . 
  no need for such a pompous language . 
  that is just a sheer stupidity . 
  edit : downvotes because you disagree or did n't get the joke that stupid is n't the comment i replied to , but marine ? 
  handball < 3, 
  if you 're saying we 're good at football , how bad the czechs must be ? 
  yeah , poland 's perspective . 
  thanks for answering , 
  noob question : how do nuclear plants look from our perspective ? 
  my speculation , but because it 's `` a left-wing policy . '', 
  obviously , anything more progressive than the `` patriots '' is considered communist , therefore un-polish , anti-polish and bad . 
  edit : sorry , wrong comment . 
  the answer to you : it seems to cover all the city . 
  there 's less of a problem outside poland 's major cities from what i 've seen ; i now live in krakow , but when i was commuting last year from tarn\u00f3w , a mist-like thing very often covered the air once i was ~ 10 km from city limits approaching by the a4 highway . 
  it is very worrisome . 
  the city is very nice , but the air quality is unhealthy and the pollution is high to the point of the air smelling like a public crapper . 
  particulate matter pm10 was at 308 \u00b5g / m ^ 3 today at 2.00 pm ^ 1 ( eu 's standard ^ 2 is 40 \u00b5g / mg ^ 3 ) . 
  this is about 7 times more than it 's ought to be . 
  it is n't normal , nor is it healthy .

  it 's the 3rd polish republic at the moment . 
  the current government likes to say they 're ` cleaning up the mess it 's became ' and it became a joke that it 'll basically be the _ 4th _ republic once they start ruling . 
  _ lechistan _ is poland 's archaic name and since the same people who ` clean up the mess ' cherish our history ( read : use it in populistic purposes ) , it 's lechistan * . 
  _ empire _ , because , obviously , ` polan stronk . ' * on a funny note , this name is still used in some languages , e.g. 
  persian . 
  we 'll pass over to russia . 
   there is about 65 millions refugees around the globe . 
  i know . 
  and we , as humanity , should strive to shrink this number . 
   yeah , these us citizens probably have moral responsibility to help these poor eritreans , just need to get rid of trump . 
  this was just a comparison to show anyone can be an illegal alien , but since you say that ... 
   they want the libyan coast guard considering the situation in the country - in terms of economy and security - i think it 'd be pretty easy to bribe them . 
  dunno if it _ is _ , but my first thought was that there is quite a chance . 
  they still could be allowed to come , economic migrants or refugees . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure one could consider eritrean migrants to be political refugees , considering how tight of a grip the local government has on the population . 
  and you may say we do n't need to accept economic immigrants ( or even refugees ) - you 're technically right , but it may help you empathize seeing how many poles left to usa during cold war and stayed there - in 1970 they counted 5,105,000 ; in 1980 : 8,228,037 - many illegally . 
  damn right . 
  i 'm wishing someone reintroduced it , a modern train with this design . 
  even if it did n't make for a perfect way of transport , maybe it could be some kind of a tourist attraction ? 
  we have pendolinos ( i suppose pesa darts may count to ? 
  ) , so we do n't need a brand new fast train per se , but it 'd be nice to see it around . 
  i agree . 
  i 'm in favor of taking refugees ( as one way of helping ) , but we need a system that is secure and makes sense . 
  while i empathize with refugees , it seems like the current way they 're getting to europe gets people super insecure , which is also kind of understandable . 
  we need control , however i do not agree with populists saying we should kick everyone out while sealing the border - it 's better to meet somewhere in the middle . 
  big bro at it again, 
  lol . 
  mul\u0163umiri ( only textual flair shows on mobile ), 
  i need to know - what is the fish shaped country ? 
  poland does n't either , when it comes to imigrants and terrorism . 
  edit : wording, 
  it 's long . 
  having lived there for 5 years , i prefer writing czechia . 
   they have their own social media afaik . 
  you 're thinking vkontakte . 
  that 's likely . 
  there _ are _ people like that tho . 
  there 's a lot of the catholic church 's influence on politics . 
  there 's the concordat . 
  the constitution itself states the marriage is between a man and a woman . 
  you see the moon ? 
  look further . 
  some people seem to be triggered by how others can _ love _ each other . 
  i 'm easily a eu federalist . 
  i wish i could give you more upvotes . 
  offtopic , but i do n't get the downvotes . 
  you 're at the moment being far more mature than the most i 've seen on reddit . 
  i 've spent 9 years in european schools ( poland & czechia ) . 
  i find it strange and stupid that we had no single class on how the union works and who is who . 
  might be something in high school , but it does n't seem to be enough from what i see in discussions concerning the eu . 
  after 2004 you can see the sudden change of progress for the better . 
  bilboards stating that something was funded by the union are a common view . 
  i like \u017co\u0142\u0105d\u017a , personally . 
  ' #polandmasterrace ', 
  supporting a federal europe myself , i do believe it was one of the pettiest laws eu passed . 
  who said i spoke of quality ? 
  i know . 
  did n't make the gif . 
  reposting from / r/polska, 
  `` droga kreta '' means `` mole 's road . '', 
  did you mean `` droga kr\u0119ta , '' or curvy road ? 
  it 's funny , because it 's still true . 
  there was an alert , higher so at the beginning of the conflict . 
  the topic of russia invading is generaly a popular one , due to past imperialistic tendencies of the country that reached our borders many times in last two , three centuries . 
  it was quite often said that they could try to go via belarus , it being `` putin 's puppet state . '', 
  it 's calmed down since , but there 's still some speculation - not as much as before , but still - about russia 's further plans ; it 's obvious at this point that it is involved in donbas by proxy and the question is whether or not it 's going to escalate and anexate the whole ukraine , and - eventually - also poland . 
  sld is bunch of ex-communists . 
  i 'm glad they did n't make it and to have a fresh progressive party . 
   non-russians , which one do you find culturally nearer , us or russia ? 
  i find myself closer to the states . 
  i like russian music and the language , but overally i 'm tilted westwards , though born in poland , country relatively similar to russia . 
   after the trump victory , there has been a lot of media discussion in india about a similar wave simmering in europe . 
  how does the general sentiment seem in your country ? 
  this has been around for a while , long before trump made the stunt . 
  though i find the root of the issue to be similar . 
  they 've gained some momentum since the last elections ( october 2015 ) , when law & justice won . 
   famous yogis from india always talk about yoga and ayurveda being very popular in eastern europe . 
  how true is that ? 
  what is your general impression about these traditional sciences ? 
  i would n't say yoga 's very popular , but it is a thing .
