probably . 
  btw , i love the political correctness :  the independent report from the labour mp for stockport was commissioned to see what has changed since the rochdale case in 2012 when nine ** asian men ** were jailed for grooming girls with alcohol , drugs and gifts before forcing them to have sex with multiple men . 
  not sure if you 're interested in poland , but here it is - if you 're in a fairly expensive restaurant it 's not uncommon to tip , up to somewhere around 5-15 % . 
  if you 're in a `` regular '' restaurant then you are n't really expected to tip , but you can round up the price , i think 10 % would be already quite generous . 
  * cough * , italy , * cough *, 
  i know , but if there are poles that do n't like romanians , it 's primarily because the stereotype is that romania is mostly inhabited with begging and thieving gypsies , and most romanians in poland ( or at least in the 90s ) were gypsies that ... let 's say were n't doing their best to protect their reputation . 
  * cossacks but yeah . 
  looks like the feeling is mutual because a lot of poles do not like gypsies . 
  ( yes , i know that not all romanians are gypsies ), 
  probably retirees happy to settle in a country with low costs of living . 
  bulgaria is cheaper and warmer than poland , so it 's a better place to retire to , and poland is n't the best country to live in , otherwise there would n't be so many poles moving to northern and western europe . 
  not really , as the map also shows all countries of europe and two eurasian ones ( turkey and russia ) . 
  there are a lot of very dangerous substances ( e.g. 
  codeine or opium based ) already more or less easily available from pharmacies in many countries , and it does n't mean we are having whole generations dying at 28 from overdose . 
  as long as it 's clearly marked what it is , and how dangerous it is , i do n't see a problem . 
   miros\u0142aw hermaszewski was born into a ** polish family ** in lipniki , volhynia , formerly in poland ( wo\u0142y\u0144 voivodeship ) he was born in 1941 to two poles , and two years prior to that volhynia was part of poland . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roseng%c3%a5rd#violence  fire crews have also been threatened and attacked . 
  as a result , the malm\u00f6 fire department refused to respond to fire calls in roseng\u00e5rd without police escort . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roseng%c3%a5rd#demographics_2  unemployment and education are two major issues in the area . 
  only 38 % of the population in roseng\u00e5rd are employed and 60 % complete elementary school , compared to a city-wide average ( inclusive roseng\u00e5rd ) of 80 % . 
  that * does * look very bad to me . 
  greenland ( denmark ) - 19.4 russia - 9.2 lithuania - 6.7 moldova - 6.5 united states - 4.7 portland - 3.3 otoh ... chicago - 18.5 detroit and new orleans - 50 + each, 
  it 's a polish beer , not a czech one . 
   it 's not bad , but i think czechs have better tasting beer than we do ( and it 's cheaper ) . 
  he should definitely try some czech beers while he 's in prague - they 're both good * and * cheap . 
  i do n't live in germany , but when i traveled to berlin for 2 days some of the tourist places were swarmed with fake petition gypsies . 
  because the negotations are done in an undemocratic , intransparent manner , behind closed doors , and because it may result in more harm than good with the rent-seeking via stricter copyright and ip laws ( vide acta ) , which are ( at least to me ) draconian to begin with , and with poorer countries losing more of their sovereignty to richer ones . 
  fwiw , it has several potential upsides too , such as potentially simpler laws and regulations with some of them shared by the countries signing the agreement , but i do n't think they can make up for the downsides .

  abroad we are often known as hardworking . 
  among ourselves , probably not so much , and i think there is a lot of truth in saying that poles complain a lot . 
  more `` everywhere '' , both work and touristic , other times just shopping or traveling through to other destinations . 
  but i mainly traveled to cities , the closest thing to `` rural '' were small towns in the mountains , but most of the time i went to medium to big cities . 
  does it include people of all ages ? 
  germany 's number looks very low to me ( i have never had a problem with speaking in english whenever i was in germany , and i 've been there at least a 100 times ) , while poland 's number looks very high . 
  do n't worry , we will get kaliningrad back . 
  unfortunately most poles are unaware of the scale of mass surveillance in poland : https://www.eff.org/issues/mandatory-data-retention/poland, 
  not the particle states , i meant which one here : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/map_of_usa_with_state_names.svg / u/newisbad was asking because / u/bleach143 has `` european union '' as his flair , and it does n't tell much ( not implying that it should ) . 
  which state are you from ? 
  stories of people old enough to remember it ( family , friends ) , internet , and books ( mainly solzhenitsyn ) . 
  * paid unless they 're both sailors or something . 
   there have been some cases where the parents mutilate the children when they are babies ( usually burns ) so that they would make more money by begging because people would feel sorry for them . 
  they do that a lot in india . 
  burning , blinding , cutting limbs , you name it . 
  stupid american and western european tourists can be partly blamed for this . 
  in poland it 's taught by the clergy , but the state ( = taxpayer ) covers the costs , it 's about 1 billion pln per year iirc ( 1 pln = 4 $ ) . 
  this . 
  we only get to see gypsies . 
   it 's especially funny when people like you steal `` bad things '' from other entities - in this case soviet union , as poland was n't independent in 1968 . 
  this . 
  the closest thing that comes to my mind right now is the invastion of vilnius in 1919 . 
  but then there were very few casualties and no genocide took place . 
  too much time on reddit maybe ? 
  well ... that was my impression when i used to live there . 
  eventually i learned some french , but my first year there was n't fun . 
  wages are rather low compared to western europe , and fortunately there are n't many high social benefits , so the few foreigners that come here are those that want to work ( they are mostly ukrainian or vietnamese ) , and my impression is that they 're law-abiding , hard working people . 
  ( maybe with the exception of * some * vietnamese that belong to mafia and charge their compatriots for `` protection '' ), 
  normal , as in most countries behind the iron curtain were like that . 
  ( and so was poland , that 's why / u/komalt described it as `` normal '' ), 
  i understood maybe 20 % of what they were saying ... 
  it does n't necessarily mean it would be more difficult to travel , uk could still be a part of efta or eea . 
  i doubt they are crying . 
  they usually own and manage their foreign stuff & businesses through various proxies . 
  funny thing is , a lot of those beggars actually earn decent money for the type of `` work '' they 're doing , especially in busy places . 
  here 's an interesting experiment someone did in poland : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iptmna0fhtk# it 's in polish but they do n't talk much and you 'll still laugh how they tricked the gypsy woman . 
  they calculated a beggar can earn 21 pln an hour on average . 
  minimum wage is about 6-7 pln an hour after taxes . 
  the last sentence in that video says : `` consider how much you earn , and is it time to change your profession ? '', 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_estonia#composition ), 
  3 years ago there were 133000 homeless people in france : [ source ] ( http://expresse.excite.fr/133000-sdf-et-29-millions-de-mal-loges-en-france-n13637.html ) so those 0.3 % could be from natural causes ( many of them are old ) . 
   these are n't international destinations , just european ones . 
  eu ones , to be specific . 
  nothing about norway , belarus , ukraine , russia , former yugoslavia , etc. 
  unfortunately , most of the money ends up in the politicians ' and their friends ' pockets . 
  we might be hard workers but that is * definitely * not because of communism . 
  i 'd say those immigrants want to make the most out of their situation while they 're there . 
  communism actually did the opposite to many people because it created an entitlement attitude that the state has to provide for you . 
  in pre-1990 poland there officially was no unemployment because you could always get a job from the state , regardless of whether there was a need for such a job , and it was natural for 8 people do a job that could be done by 2 ( the requirements to get a job was not having skills but being `` passive , mediocre , but faithful '' . 
  absolute number should be shown alongside percentages because poland is still behind a lot , hence the growth . 
  according to the imf poland is still a developing country , and developing economies have more room to grow , so it 's not surprising that poland is leading in gdp growth . 
  other european developing countries that are not growing as quickly ( romania , bulgaria ) could mean that something hinders the growth of their economies . 
  i think , like most poles , he does n't like guns . 
  the anti-gun attitude has origins in post-wwii poland when iosif vissarionovic dzugasvili ordered everyone to return their weapons ( that does n't need explaining why , i hope ) . 
  70 years after the end of wwii and a quarter of a century after the end of the people 's republic of poland , most people are strongly against guns of any kind and the gun laws in poland are one of the strictest in europe . 
  people think guns can only be used for attacking and dismiss the argument that they can be used for self-defence . 
  as for the `` shitkicked cowboy country '' -- that 's stereotyping . 
  a lot of people seem to think all of us is like southern us ( especially the poor or redneck parts ) . 
  ** poland ** due to a lot of construction and road building going on in the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , the parking fees will be cheaper 30-60 % next year . 
  switzerland and iceland are expensive ... 
  if you can do it i 'd recommend work remotely for someone based in western europe and live in eastern/southern/southeastern europe where costs of living are 1/6 to 1/3 of what they are in western europe . 
  lipniki were part of poland before the war and his parents were both polish . 
  i also do n't have to mention he was a polish national when he went into space . 
  warszawa is more expensive than other cities . 
  it 's 6zl ( 1.50 $ ) or 8zl ( 1.90 $ ) in a more expensive place in lodz . 
  i thought we were the m\u00e9xico of europe ? 
  i remember that everyone had to attend religion classes by default ( of course the only religion it was about was catholicism ) , unless you specifically did n't want to -- then you parents had to write and sign a statement and the student would attend ethics classes and if there was no competent teacher for that the student could have free time during the period the rest of his classmates had religion . 
  this is somewhat true ... 
  i consider myself an agnostic ( not a leftist one though ) and i am opposed to abortion ( could be an influence of my catholics upbringing ) though i am also against the state forbidding abortions because it does n't work . 
  illegal abortions or trips abroad to perform abortions make up the difference between today and pre-1989 times when abortions were easier to conduct . 
  these figures only show legal abortions .
