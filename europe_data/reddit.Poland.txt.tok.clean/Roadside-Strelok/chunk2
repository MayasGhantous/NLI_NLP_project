  a lot of women who want to abort but ca n't due to the law do so illegally or do it legally but abroad . 
  no one works more than 8h a day in spain ? 
  source ? 
  gothic series is/was huge in poland . 
  services , rent , utilities , etc. 
  are generally cheaper , but electronics , cars , and anything we do n't produce locally costs as much as elsewhere or more . 
  nice to see something new around here !, 
  * korwin-mikke ( polish `` w '' is pronounced like english `` v '' ), 
  til . 
  the wages are still 3-4 time higher in most of western and northern europe than in poland . 
  not slavic , but still `` brothers '' . 
  i would n't say it 's 35 % , though . 
  the scale was from -1 to +1 . 
  gypsies got -0.85 , and the highest rating was 0.73 . 
  since 0 is neutral 0.35 would translate into 6.75 on a 0 to 10 scale . 
  so maybe not super positive , but still positive overall . 
   what do they have against vietnam ? 
  i also found this strange . 
  a lot of them are well-integrated and speak very decent polish ( native-level polish if they were born here ) , and they 're hard-working . 
  so far i 've only heard good things about them . 
  well , i 've heard bad things about vietnamese gangs , extorting from their compatriots and running up high bills in rented apartments from 24/7 marijuana grow lights , but those guys are a very small minority . 
  it used to be higher in the 90s when the usa were seen as almost a paradise ... these days not so much . 
  also , many people dislike our governments ' ass-kissing attitude when it comes to relations with the us . 
  well , my experiences and observations are different - i used to see a lot of squatting among both strangers and my family , and i too used to squat a lot . 
  for some reason i do n't see people squatting as often nowadays . 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/vladimir-putin-phones-elton-john-after-request-to-discuss-gay-rights-in-russia ), 
  .22 lr is more like 0.25 zl per round , 0.80 zl would be if bought directly at the range if you do n't have your own gun and permit . 
  .38 , yeah , about 1.3-1 .6 zl . 
  9x18 and 9x19 are about 0.75 zl . 
  7.62 x39 is ~ 0.6-0 .8 zl . 
  safe is a minimum few hundred zloty , but you 'd probably want something that will hold at least 4 long guns and have place for ammo and handguns . 
  such as safe costs ~ 1000-1500zl . 
  jumping through all the hoops to get the permit ( club membership , exams , license , medical , etc. ), 
  will run you around 2000zl or more . 
  including the safe you 're looking at  3000zl minimum . 
  should take around 5-8 months . 
  after that you just need to pay your monthly or yearly club fee , which is usually between 0 and 100zl per month . 
  add few hundred zloty per year for tournament fees that you should attend to keep your license ( should n't take you more than 2 days out of the year to keep up with that ) . 
  maybe it was `` deactivated '' . 
   in poland it 's quite difficult to own a gun . 
  i would n't say it 's difficult , but time-consuming to jump through all the hoops ( it takes a good 6 months to get the sports permit ) . 
  eh , it 's the same in poland , gun stores , gun clubs and firing ranges have shitty websites 90 % of the time . 
  some of them do n't even have a website ... 
  my thermometer showed 39c in the shade several weeks ago . 
  which one if i may ask ? 
  it 's not that we do n't like foreigners , it 's more that foreigners usually prefer countries with a higher standard of living . 
  it 's actually safer than western europe . 
  ukraine , georgia , maybe moldova . 
   for one , there 's nothing more free than freedom to move your company 's headquarters to where you think is more profitable . 
  true . 
  not so true about this though :  giving special deals to the big corporations , bailing out private companies with public money, 
  show me one . 
  stop generalizing . 
  not all countries are so retarded when it comes to knives . 
  in my country for example you can even legally walk on the streets with a double handed sword , only knives hidden in objects where one would not expect to find a knife are forbidden , e.g. 
  a blade hidden in a walking cane . 
  you may not remember , but i do , all over the world many people started realizing that a similar thing may happen to their own money in their bank accounts , and enough of them turned to bitcoin which subsequently saw a price increase from $ 20 to $ 266 in a span of few months . 
  now it seems they want to take a significant percentage of anything above 8k $ , i do n't think people are going to easily forget about this . 
   nothing blew up apart from people losing 50-100 % of anything above 100 000 $ , yeah , nothing blew up . 
   dea wouldnt go away because people would still try to make shit without paying tax on it only if the taxes would be high enough to incentivize tax evasion . 
  smuggling cigarettes is profitable in many countries , but i have n't yet heard of anyone trying to smuggle potatoes . 
   cerstve means `` fresh '' in czech and `` stale '' in russian and ukrainian ( usually referring to bread ) i have n't heard of that one so far . 
  in polish we also refer to stale bread as czerstwe/czerstwy . 
  we still have kurwa , but c\u00f3ra * is an archaic form for daughter ( these days c\u00f3rka is more popular ) . 
  * in polish \u00f3 and u are pronounced exactly the same way, 
  agreed . 
  i just pointed that out because afaik all of the green countries on the map have low rates of young adults living with their parents mostly due to handouts they can afford to give out . 
  not everyone has or can afford insurance against theft , not to mention that it rarely pays the full amount ( at least where i 'm from ) . 
   defence of property is never a ground for a defence of self-protection against a charge of murder , across europe . 
  it is in poland , please do n't generalize . 
  it 's because our government does n't have too much money to hand out freely , much less to young and able-bodied citizens . 
   government money is enough to survive on  people appreciate the responsibility of taking care of yourself lol . 
  rent for smaller apartments is around 1000 pln outside of warsaw ( where the wages are also appropriately higher ) . 
  singles and couples can usually live fairly comfortably in a 30-40 square meter apartment . 
   dear foreigners , on behalf of my fellow lithuanians , who do n't know that certain n-words are considered slurs elsewhere , please do n't take offense if you hear yourself being called a `` negras '' [ neh-ghras ] . 
  that should signal sincere curiosity . 
  but if you hear a `` nigeris '' - punch the fucker in the mouth so it seems it 's like with polish , while `` czarny '' is inoffensive and simply descriptive , somewhat similarly spelled `` czarnuch '' is a slur . 
  one of them is even * the * ceo . 
  google `` casting couch '' . 
  i too like marche slave . 
  aside from that , i also like op. 61 by mendelssohn http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ua_w1wb5a dvorak 's and shostakovich 's symphonies are also nice . 
  or about 10 ` 000 rounds of ak-47 ammo each . 
  it 's not true , but if it 's over a certain amount , it must be reported . 
  do n't forget about the cheap oil . 
  relevant username . 
  serbia , and bosnia and herzegovina are also 1st world ? 
  they 're both poorer than romania, 
  the standard of living is a bit higher in czech republic , poland is still considered to be a developing country by the imf : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developing_country https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=17711ffc-0524-76ab-ceb0fe206e46c125 p. 22-24  wealth per adult ( 2013 , usd )  czech republic - 44,975  poland - 26,056, 
  poor romanians again being equated with gypsies . 
  at least they got poland right , to put it humbly . 
  source ? 
  does this apply to people who have employees working remotely from abroad ? 
   kto sieje wiatr , ten zbiera burz\u0119 who sows the wind , will reap the whirlwind . 
  lol . 
  is this something about `` mother 's cunt '' ? 
   at some point , a government has to be willing to say to its subjects , `` fuck your rights pls not again , germoney, 
   1/3 of the economy is done outside official bookkeeping i have a hard time believing it 's this low . 
  in poland the figure depending on the estimate is 15-25 % . 
  it 's * relative * poverty , what qualifies as poverty in the us would easily be middle-class in many european countries . 
  that does not sound like they are right wing to me ...
