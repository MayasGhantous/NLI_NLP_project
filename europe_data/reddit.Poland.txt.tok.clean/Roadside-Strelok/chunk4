  programmers who work for non-local clients can often earn as much or more than in several western european countries like germany , belgium or italy . 
  you should have mentioned you were talking about a room . 
  but yeah , a room is doable outside of warsaw , especially if location & quality are secondary concerns . 
  you wo n't find a flat for a 100 pounds per month this is not 1998 . 
  a room , sure , but even then it 's stretching it . 
  i replied on my mobile phone and thought you were responding to a different comment . 
  it 's not that it 's a point of pride , but people are more likely to be exposed to english vocabulary in their written , rather than the spoken form , so they might not always immediately understand the words unless they are spoken to in their native language 's pronunciation , so in poland * wi-fi * becomes * vee-fee * , in france * chewing gum * becomes * shwingum * , etc. 
  another point raised in a different comment also applies to polish :  it 's just that in order to properly pronounce an english word in the middle of a greek sentence you have to completely change your cadence and speech and it shows , it 's slightly jarring in conversation , it does not flow naturally . 
  fwiw , i noticed similar things happening in a few other countries such as france , poland and india . 
   so if you do n't do it you can be perceived as lazy or that you are leeching your parents . 
  ... as opposed to leeching from the taxpayers . 
  * smuggled * implies illegality , but what optimus did was perfectly legal . 
  article in english since i was n't allowed to submit it directly : [ chancellor : ` compulsory education or training until the age of 25 ' ] ( http://www.thelocal.at/20160906/austrian-chancellor-announces-ambitious-plan-to-boost-employment ), 
  also , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestapo%e2%80%93nkvd_conferences, 
   i put / r/polska as the official polish sub . 
  i think it 's fine . 
  / r/polska is also a geo-default sub unlike / r/poland . 
   poland - / r/poland is for english-language posts , / r/polska is for posts in polish . 
  the latter has 42k subs , the former has only 7k subs . 
  english posts on / r/polska seem to be allowed . 
  / r/polska mod here while we wo n't outright delete non-polish posts , they are generally discouraged as / u/gbursztynek noted above ( below ? 
  ) , and those users are often redirected to / r/poland . 
  on the sidebar we have :  * for english language posts try / r/poland . 
   i wonder what the longest ( realistic ) polish word means/is . 
  i googled and could n't find anything . 
  there are too many ways in which it is possible to lengthen many words , many of which are at least very occasionally used . 
  if someone wanted to `` cheat '' they 'd just use names of very long chemical compounds , e.g. 
  the full name of the titin protein which measures 189819 letters . 
  there are longer words , e.g. 
  automatics are still in a minority : http://www.statista.com/statistics/204123/transmission-type-market-share-in-automobile-production-worldwide/, 
  * masakra * can be translated to * massacre * but in today 's usage it mostly means `` terrible '' . 
  300 rounds is n't that much really , and does n't take that much space . 
  someone participating in dynamic shooting may easily shoot this amount in one visit at the range . 
  i do n't know what 's the black market rate for 9x19 ( i 'm assuming the guy was using a glock chambered in 9mm - as most are ) , but on the legal , regulated market , 300 rounds would cost him like 80 eur or less ( at least that 's the going rate in poland for non-bulk quantities ) . 
  what happened to the ` journalist ' ? 
  did he end up in prison ? 
  are n't the guns which find themselves in belgium originating from the balkans ? 
  magazines are not regulated gun parts he could have bought it anywhere in the eu . 
  these are not new words : https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=rightist%2cleftist&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=1&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3b%2crightist%3b%2cc0%3b%2cs0%3b%3brightist%3b%2cc0%3b%3brightist%3b%2cc0%3b.t4%3b%2cleftist%3b%2cc0%3b%2cs0%3b%3bleftist%3b%2cc0%3b%3bleftist%3b%2cc0, 
  czechia - guns & beer, 
  `` referendum '', 
  why sad ? 
  the more of them come , the more will romanians ' wages increase - at least in the relevant sectors , but other industries may also benefit from increased spending . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers#summer_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/august_sabbe, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide  genocide is the intentional action to systematically eliminate an ethnic , national , racial , or religious group . 
  the word is a combination of `` genos '' ( race , people ) and `` cide '' ( to kill ) . 
  the united nations genocide convention defines it as `` acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_ ( 1937 % e2 % 80 % 9338 )  it was ordered by the politburo against the so-called `` polish spies '' and customarily interpreted by the nkvd officials as relating to `` absolutely all poles '' . 
   in order to speed up the process the nkvd personnel reviewed local telephone books and arrested persons with polish-sounding names . 
  poland has had and still maintains diplomatic and business relations with north korea , this is not a first time nk lends its people to other countries ( poland , russia ) for cheap work . 
  when was 900 euro/month upper middle class in hungary ? 
  15 years ago ? 
   it 's applied to people worldwide uncovering corruption . 
  true . 
  last year in poland an ex-building inspector was released after 8 years of internment in a mental asylum for refusing to participate in some corruption scheme . 
  i wonder how many more cases like his are out there . 
   75 % lower than the eu average i think you meant it was 75 % of the eu average . 
  if it was 75 % lower than the eu average , cornwall would be poorer than bulgaria 's poorest region ( and bulgaria itself is the poorest eu country ) . 
  you 're right that price is the primary reason why manuals were always more popular and this is what people got used to , but that does n't negate the fact that clutch-wearing is a non-issue even for relatively novice drivers . 
  maybe american clutches are simply of inferior quality ? 
  til me and everyone i know is a professional driver . 
   ~ ~ most people ~ ~ clueless americans wear out their clutches ftfy it 's not an issue if you actually know how to drive . 
   they were massively over-represented in overstaying visas compared to other eu countries . 
  not anymore , check the recent [ entry/exit overstay report ] ( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fy%2015%20dhs%20entry%20and%20exit%20overstay%20report.pdf ) total overstay rate : poland - 1.49 % and for some vwp countries : hungary - 2.92 % portugal - 2.31 % greece - 2.31 % san marino - 2.28 % italy - 1.60 %, 
   $ 1000 to register are you sure it 's not a zero or two too much ? 
  it usually costs only ~ 20 euro in poland . 
  it 's poorer than many ( most ? ), 
  african countries . 
  take it with a grain of salt , the poll does n't seem to discern between countries and ethnicities . 
  most people do n't have anything against ukrainians but may perceive the country as poor and backwards , hence the negative views among some . 
  and no , no one here advocates the return of ukraine to poland , it 's not even discussed or treated seriously . 
  looks like a toy with that orange tip . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qguw3xxsk ), 
  median wage after taxes is around 2400 pln . 
  legal owners very rarely commit crimes with legally acquired guns , it would n't change anything apart from making the society even more restrictive , and providing a false sense of security . 
  ignoring how impossible that sounds , that still would n't prevent people bringing guns from outside the eu . 
  same with people making their own guns ( there are detailed manuals freely available ) . 
  so far it seems it is n't known where he got the guns and grenades . 
  if he got it where he probably got the grenades from ( dark web or the balkans ) then no stricter anti-gun laws would have helped here , unless you are advocating to turn france into a dictatorship with random house searches , leaving schengen , armed border patrols , etc. 
  even then there 's always enough demand on the black market for people to want to risk smuggling arms . 
  there are no eu countries where an underage non-resident could buy a gun without holding a french gun permit ( which he obviously also would n't get ) . 
  we can and after jumping through a few hoops there are very few restrictions on what we can own aside from the fact that full-auto is almost impossible to get , but so far it seems our government is n't going to do jack shit to protect us from this new directive , even though they call themselves right-wingers/conservatives . 
  i hope you succeed . 
  and some people wonder why i wish i had been born a czech . 
  think you could invite him for an ama ? 
  some places in lesser poland , e.g. 
  it got as low as -39 in a few places this winter . 
  https://pl.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/pali\u0107_jak_smok maybe it depends on the region . 
  it 's `` he smokes like a dragon '' in poland . 
  netflix already costs more or less the same all over europe . 
  you missed * \u0144 * . 
  i 'd say most are either neutral or sympathetic to the issue . 
  i myself always support self-determination though it sucks to see that some of the kurdish factions are socialist . 
  still , they at least are n't marxist-leninists , and i find rojava an interesting experiment . 
  i used to see cops guarding synagogues 24/7 in 2007-2009 in france , never saw any near churches, 
   these rifles do n't look like ( nor is it their intent ) a sportive `` instrument '' . 
  yes it is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpr8oqyjkic not the same rifle , but to some equally scary looking . 
  in poland people also shoot those during competitions , though we prefer not to draw unnecessary attention in public . 
  no , it 's just no longer given for free to keep at home , people can still easily buy it themselves . 
   kgb men like putin took power from them that 's debatable whether he managed to take power from the oligarchs ...
