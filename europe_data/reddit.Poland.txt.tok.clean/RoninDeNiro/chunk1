i 'd but awesome bicycles for all of my friends . 
  i 'm with you on most of those . 
  the only time i ate entire bowl of kapu\u015bniak was back in my military service , when there was nothing else to eat . 
  / r/polska is the official sub tho, 
  since our former pm shares name with current potus , we have our own version of / r/the _ donald - / r/the _ donek . 
  2000 $ / hour wage . 
  of course it is - my mum and all of my friends live here . 
  yeah . 
  one time some drunk guy was banging at the door , i called the police and nobody took the phone . 
  i called both the police line and the local precinct . 
  i was also stopped twice for dui ( rui ? ), 
  test whilst riding my bike to / from work - of course i 'm hammered everytime i wear lycra and a big backpack . 
  but to be honest it was more weird than bad - at least to me . 
  it 's kinda weird that both austria and australia use the same service rifle . 
  all of the guns he describes come from belgium , so it 's an easy guess , 
  do n't worry . 
  i was taught in the military that ak in ak-47 is derived from its constructor 's initials . 
  alcohol culture . 
  i eat about 2 big tablespoons per day during cycling season . 
  pb + plum puree is awesome on fresh bread . 
  edit : autocorrect mistake, 
  beer . 
  airwolf and voltron opening themes . 
  i guess i like basic flags because german flag is my second favorite after yours . 
  i just like the color combination . 
  roadbike with a compact crankset and 11-32 casette . 
  it 's better when you 're fit though . 
  adam ma\u0142ysz , but i 'm old and do n't watch tv anymore . 
  younger folk would propably say robert lewandowski . 
  i 'd go with [ karol wojty\u0142a ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pope_john_paul_ii ) . 
  well , you need to boil it to make tea , coffee or a soup :p, 
  i do , but we drink it after boiling most of the time . 
  taste is fine . 
  i buy bottled water because i like the fizzy kind . 
  yeah , we love used german cars . 
  we drive them to death , and try to spend as little money as possible into maintenance . 
  i do n't think it 's very big . 
  over half of poles are overweight and 25 \u2105 are obese . 
  we do n't care what we eat as long as it tastes nice . 
  it 's propably a lot better in big cities , i heard that co-founder od cdprojekt is planning to open a vegan restaurant in warsaw . 
  i do n't think i know any vegetarians in real life tbh . 
  i had no idea . 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  there are many awesome classics from the commie times that i like , but [ `` ale wko\u0142o jest weso\u0142o '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_xsuuqnt9e ) by perfect is propably my favourite . 
  which one ? 
  it 's like mexico with temperate climate and with far less crime . 
  [ n\u00f3\u017cki w galarecie ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=n%c3%b3%c5%bcki+w+galarecie&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewittei4jnnrahuhxrqkhvufc0kq_auibigb ) is ( are ? ), 
  pretty gross [ flaki ( or flaczki ) ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=flaki&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjfu4rajnnrahxkarqkhyinbj4q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=vozpuyw67houhm%3a ) can look disgusting as well . 
  whole house smells like shit when you prepare them . 
  have some more then . 
  same bunch of guys btw , just a little bit younger . 
  i wish you could rename cities in empire : total war . 
  you 're not alone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69isxks1bes yes , i know that japanese tv can be weird . 
  5k race under 18 minutes . 
  that would just add to the confusion . 
  no idea , i 'm not a woman . 
  just play the witcher games . 
  i ocassionally run in races . 
  does relay race count as `` playing sports '' ? 
  i used to play wfrp when i was in highschool , i 'd say it was polish equivalent of d&d in terms of popularity . 
  i 'm not a fan of having to paint the figures myself though , so i 've never tried the battle version of the game . 
  i think it 's pretty popular here , despite it being very expensive . 
  as for armies - i liked to play kislev and border princes in warhammer fantasy mod for medieval 2 : total war . 
  nobody reads but we have so many experts on various topics , 
  sure . 
  this game haunts me , i 've bought it on release and have n't played at all . 
  i 'm not well read by any stretch of imagination , but i like andrzej sapkowski ( witcher series are based on his novels ) , and stanis\u0142aw lem ( `` solaris '' * , `` the cyberiad '' ) . 
  best game with worst ai . 
   multiplayer is solid though . 
   gwent is love , gwent is life . 
  i thought that being polish would give me first dibs on gwent beta , but i was wrong . 
  i 'm still not in . 
  yes - in the military , quite a lot of rounds actually . 
  in highschool we had .22 lr rifles but we did n't go to the range to shoot unfortunately . 
  it 's also noteworthy that pc games you buy in stores are usually much cheaper than what you would pay in the west . 
  steam prices on polish store are the same as the rest of eu . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bh5rmbv.jpg ) was n't shot by me , i 'm only one of the tiny guys standing near the tower . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/dky0o_2flj4?t=163 ) . 
  is n't road racing / cyclocross like a national sport in belgium ? 
  cycling culture and infrastructure , so jealous of netherlands and belgium . 
  which state is it ? 
  i need to know if i 'll ever move to us :p, 
  cycling without helmet . 
  i ride a lot so i do wear one most of the time , but huge majority of people do n't . 
  sure , except our rednecks [ keep their guns wrapped in oiled rags and buried underground . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnwzladgrmc ), 
  it is buggy , ui could be better ( tiny icons ) but i do n't complain because i got the game for free . 
  i think civ5 complete with all of the expansions is a better game at this point but not by much . 
  if you can stomach the early 90 's style of visuals , then go for open ttd . 
  i think that the game looks beautiful to this time , it 's easy to learn and very moddable . 
  it also does n't cost anything . 
  civ 6 , kerbal space program , mercenaries 2 , warthunder and empire total war . 
  i 'm thinking about learning how to build proper railroad networks in open transport tycoon . 
  tt deluxe was one of my favourite `` childhood '' games . 
  i 'm not excited by any particular games in the future . 
  i 'd love to try vr in elite : dangerous or something like dcs or il2 : battle of stalingrad though . 
  it 's always weird to hear the phrase `` kielbasa sausage '' . 
  if by `` where i live '' you mean my little town , then only english teachers would be fluent . 
  you can learn it in school , beginning in the elementary but i do n't think most people care about it . 
  go 50km south and it 's a completely different story ,
