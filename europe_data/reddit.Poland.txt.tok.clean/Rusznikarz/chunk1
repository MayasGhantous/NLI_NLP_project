1.7 m legaly staying people ... 
  there are quite a ` few ' unregistered ones :p, 
  well does n't warsaw have like the same population as lithuania ... supersirus, 
  to say the truth in poland situation is very simillar in multi-party system we have 2 major parties and the rest have pretty much no chance in elections . 
  as most people are opposed to party x so they vote on party y and not the others ( all are pretty bad ) as that would give party x higher chance for winning or a coalition . 
  damn , now you made me translate it ; /, 
  maybe they only look old ... 
  right now . 
  but take into account that this data is probably heavily based on historical data . 
  be careful or i 'll emigrate to better part of europe !, 
  well us is the most comparable country in the world to eu as both are developed , consider themselves modern . 
  comparison with china/india/russia / brasil would be pointless as they are n't developed yet . 
  and japan cheats in life expectancy :p . also not many people from japan here to comment . 
  noble peasants :p, 
  non-white people are very rare sight a bit less so in big cities but still . 
  but romania still gets more foreigners than us ... 
  but old grudges never vanish . 
  why would they need british imperialism when they have russian one ... 
  maybe for young countries ... 
   bor\u00e1t that borat ... 
  they f * ck up otherwise rather nice borders . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_joke your welcome ... 
  i like how it feels like your talking about poland ... polish p\u00f8lse the best !, 
  oh god . 
  poor bulgaria :(, 
  polish minority blah blah/evil lithuanians opress polish minorities ... 
  not in poland they do not !, 
  it 's quite funny how easy it is to identify foreigners here ... 
  now now calm down we stole their jobs too !, 
  meh , losing english language would be bad ... 
  well if sanctions would hit only the big boys there . 
  there probably would be no hard feelings against the west in general population ... 
  pretty much [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/02/ukraine-dead-odessa-building-fire ) . 
  im not in any way saying that it was averange ukrainian is at fault but every country have it 's share of f -- kups ( in poland we have ruch narodowy ) there 's no way to avoid it . 
  and setting fire to a building when people are inside can not be justified . 
   what did you expect from people who like to burn people alive like it happened in odessa ? 
  right sector and alike are nazis agree with this . 
  but please remember right sector does not have 40 mln members . 
  my bet would be there are few thousands people like that in ukraine at most which would be pretty normal , 
  truth is after watching some vice videos on youtube about ukraine , i no longer can even imagine how bad ww2 must have been ... 
  i think he meant that some people wanted to be open . 
  but not everyone and the pissed part was probably part of the reason for partitions so yes , he is right . 
  commonwealth was n't some [ magical ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/targowica_confederation ) country where everyone agreed with each other . 
  is this for real ? 
  gdp per capita in poland is pretty much equal around eastern europe, 
   not my problem . 
  mayve you should fix it . 
  ideally by turning russia into your friend . 
  yeah !!, 
  become friend with russia !, 
  let them annex you !, 
  us always appear in media as kinda war hungry ... also forgot about napoleon we are one of the few countries who like the guy . 
  uk on the other hand has sizable polish minority who would probably go ape shit if uk ignored poland :p but overall there would be basically two possible scenarios either majority come to help or no one . 
  as if say france helped the rest is very likely to follow suit . 
  the first major player to help is the important part . 
  i no way did i mean to sound as if i meant france is less worthy ally than uk/germany . 
  us is kinda you know all those movies and they 're media/jeans corrupted my mind so i think they would go all freeedomm :p ^ ^ ^ ^ le ^ ^ ^ ^ pen, 
  well we like to complain ... and we are a bit of the pessimists duo to polish history lessons ... also the most pro-eu one have eu flag on their flair ;p ( i changed as it can be quite annoying not knowing where that person is from ), 
  but did they do any significant combat before france was attacked ? 
  also have you heard of poland declaring war on japan during ww2 ? 
  us was totally relieved back then !, 
  i mean i know that france is most powerfull of uk/germany/italy ? / france . 
  but i have no knowledge about the track record he spoke off . 
  would be glad if there was one so please correct me . 
  what track record ? 
  fighting some terrorist groups is different than fighting nuclear armed state ... or are you talking about ww1 when they defended themselves or ww2 when they also defended themselves ? 
  this guy xd, 
  yeah . 
  hurt bear all the time and sooner or later he will attack you . 
  poland is not a small team it 's just reeaaaallly bad . 
   but it actually creates the precedent that you are fighting so it basically opens violence as a way to comunicate . 
  im pretty sure if you hurt an adult bear it could get violent castrated of not ... 
  youp , i would be worried about mr. putin taking foreign assets to cover their loses . 
  somehow i think long term domination against bear would be rather hard ... 
  and i am an emir of brussel, 
  but they still will need to buy a reactor . 
  watch out with praising coal ^ ^ ^ there ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ lot ^ ^ ^ anti-coal ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ around, 
  better nuclear then russian gas or dirty coal . 
  except people have more money but they can still buy the same amount of things , as the amount of things around have not changed the prices will rise ? 
  now i do . ^ not ^ very ^ serious, 
  ` electronics ' are in unique position as they are improved all the time on the other hand it 's very hard to improved on say furniture . 
  but yeah deflation fear is mostly about  it means that money sitting around grows in value . 
  therefore , any investment must be really profitable to be worthwhile, 
  in poland i think its 500 +, 
  west slav best slav !, 
  well lithuanians have their own gaz import terminal and we have enough coal for everyone :p, 
  meh have coal also gasport will be done next year, 
  i doubt it . 
  but one can always hope !, 
  have you seen the arms of isis they would n't be able to buy them without usa help !!!, 
  lol, 
  you guys ... 
  seriously only tiny minority of crazies think you should still pay for ww2 . 
  why do you think our first two good highways go to germany . 
  obviously to help you invade !, 
  yea good idea pay as much as poland ... 
  like every other culture/country in history ? 
  youp he have quite a mythos around him . 
  but then no other guy in poland can brag about defeating soviets ... 
  that 's why spain is in crisis !,
