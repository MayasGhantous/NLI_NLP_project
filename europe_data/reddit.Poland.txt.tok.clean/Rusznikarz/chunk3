  the only guy in the government i though is good at what he did ... oh well, 
  if nato does not help poland we kill pipes !, 
  eh , but the us army would have to eat something ... 1.5 mln 24h/7 tourists, 
  vast majority of russian soldiers also does not have combat experience . 
  but yea today they could just paradrop around helsinki and just capture the capital . 
  but yea it would end in afghanistan 2.0, 
  wait , so the entire ukraine thing is to take rightful polish place as nr .1 russia hater from us ?? 
  how dare they !, 
  kuril islands anyone ? 
  russia sphere of infulance - belarus , xxxstan ; germany - all of eu germany wins in the long term, 
  but mah communism !, 
  also no homeless and no jobless ? 
  have you hard of `` democratic '' people 's republic of korea ? 
  this . 
  well that guy ca n't even speak proper english ... sikorski would be better but oh well ... 
  you want a pole to drink russian vodka !? 
  sure, 
  switching from w\u00f3dka to whisky would be hard ; /, 
  so let 's go with letting turkey occupy greece as its a former part of ottoman empire which turkey is a successor state . 
  also from genetics points of view you are pretty close so you should be totally united with your former brothers ... 
  well ... 
  they speak funny all the time will slovaks only 99 % of time ;d, 
  crimea also did n't have a right to leave ukraine ? 
  or did i miss some law permitting them ... 
  but they killed a bit more poles overall :p, 
  so if i say russia pls annex warsaw , polish government is nazi , they should do just that ? 
  not really . 
  do n't worry the cires wo n't end that easily, 
  all hail sea-germans . 
  you mean to the russians ? 
  yea they were realy helpfull in 17.09 . 
  seriously though german reich jokes are n't that good . 
  and north korea have ? 
  per taxpayer in chechnya or russia ? 
  please tell me it 's chechnya because that would be ridiculous . 
  heh for a second i wanted to give you links to articles/wikipedia sites comparing russia to fascist country described in that dictionary but it would n't be worth the effort . 
   a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power , forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism , regimenting all industry , commerce , etc. , and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism . 
  [ fascism ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fascism ), 
  the enemy of your enemy ** is ** your friend though it 's how humans have worked for most of their history . 
  im not saying turkey is great or anything it 's pretty much as bad as russia ( maybe slightly better as it 's harassing its neighbors slightly less , at least lately ) . 
  but you wo n't convince people from poland that turkey is as bad as russia because they have n't hurt poland nowhere as bad , and people are much more concerned about themselves it 's how humans work you know . 
  i said `` some competition '' ;p but wars were always about business in one way or the other getting access to important resources , taking someone 's land , slaves , keeping the population under control there are hundred of reasons but in the end it 's all about greed -  war = business, 
  it 's local monopoly so there will still be some competition . 
  ** panzer r\u00fcckzug wagen ** , now with faster reverse . 
  i think average people are n't really afraid of invasion , but rather the fact that they do not think eu would do something if russia started to be more of a `` bully '' . 
  say rising gas prices embargo things like this rather then full scale invasion . 
  basicly people want to you know stand together so that they countries are n't as easy target for `` bullying '' from russia and someone at least coming to their defence ( like you bull one you bully all ) . 
  well it 's kind of truth you know in poland during communism ( probably east germany to ) everyone had work , not everyone had something to do during it but everyone had it . 
  also no homeless people . 
  but the lines oh the lines . 
  when my aunts comes from us they behaves like someone visiting third world country , but it 's probably only my aunts . 
  other then that nothing really your glorious rulers are kind of an eyesore but that 's about it . 
  you ca n't even spell glorious tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko name you `` worthless ally '' :p, 
  i must say that i have n't expected that . 
  wait , what , poland help other countries ? 
  i 'm shocked . 
  you should know that `` normal '' is good in eastern europe :p, 
  heh , i hate when polticans whine ... 
  it 's a silly country when the far-right is the whiny one . 
  yesss poland the best !, 
  640,000-1 ,080,000 dead totaly worth it . 
  well it 's a successor state is n't it ? 
  same as today poland is a succesor state of 2 world war poland and , germany is succesor of the ol' germany and so on . 
  and at least some of the dislike towards a country is born from history/parents/grandparents . 
  you know changing your name does not erase what you did in the past . 
  if it did why did people in ukraine massacre people in volhynia it was n't them that did bad stuff to ukraine it was the polish-lithuanian commonwealth !, 
  im playing a bit of the devil advocate but yeah this is what people who hate on russia at least in poland think there 's also the fact that they feel threatened by russia and russia does not really do anything to alleviate that fear . 
  but you see humans are selfish so people do n't really care what usa does in the rest of the world in europe they did n't do nowhere near the bad things russia did . 
  besides us participated in 25 wars since 1900 and russia in 41 ( most of which in europe ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_the_united_states http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_russia so excuse us that most people in europe prefer the us slightly more than russia . 
  yes but im pretty sure ukrainians are the direct descendants as in by blood while the russians are the successor state , like with byzantine empire being the successor state of roman empire . 
  also today russia do not have that much in common with kievan rus as the entire culture have evolved and changed over the years and pretty much wiping the name ruthenian as their culture name for all easter slavs so even that connection is rather weak right now . 
  wait pan-slavists in poland ? 
  i lived here my entire life and never met one o.o, 
  well i think ukraine culture is descended from ruthenian which was main ethnicity kievian rus that predates russia/grand duchy of moscow/novgorod republic by a lot . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruthenians http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kievan_rus' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muscovy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novgorod_republic, 
  yea when was the last time you saw tibet as a country on some map ? 
  mainy so that english stays as one of the main languages of the ue because i do n't want to learn german/french ... :p, 
  http://www.prlib.ru/en-us/news/pages/item.aspx?itemid=4950 it exist !!, 
  but it seems to be mainly eastern slavs thing . 
  in poland pan-slavism = russian imperialism pretty much so we do n't realy care about `` unity of slavic people '' . 
  btw is it realy some big thing in russia the whole concept of pan-slavism ( not the imperalism ) or is it just the politicians thing ? 
  it 's not about being a top dog . 
  it 's about the fact that big countries can exploit small and weak countries , ofc . 
  that 's not always the case but unfortunately it often was and still is . 
  it 's the same with russia and usa atm . 
  usa cab put a lot of sanctions on russia because they account for like 1 % of usa trade , but the same thing apply the other way , now if you say ukraine account for 10 % of eu trade and eu account for 50 % of ukraine trade and both are suddenly in conflict ( like trade dispute or whatever ) would you seriously think that eu would care about any of the ukraine interest and them losing a lot of jobs if ? 
  now replace them with any other countries and you will have my opinion that eu is good because big countries are much harder to be bullied into submission and will always have better deals ( therefore making their citizens richer ) then small ones . 
  i should have a polish flag for better effect ; /, 
  yes but that 's the same thing is n't it ? 
  one is caused by government and the other `` naturally '' but the result is the same people can buy less from other countries increasing local production as the labour is cheaper but then again exports would n't even start kicking in for several years as it takes a while to ramp up production . 
  the effect in the end is the same wages are falling be it through devaluation or cuts in wages and firing people forcing them into jobs paying less ( as we have now ) . 
  oh ... maybe bohemia/czech republic those guys have similar conditions ... 
  well america is pretty bad but if given choice between them and russia i would pick us 9 out of 10 times . 
  and as germany is n't realy keen on becoming an alternative even locally ... 
  us will have to do, 
  pretty much this . 
  overall qe is riskier than devaluation but easier to stomach for people in the short term . 
  but devaluation would essentially kill currency as world reserve currency because i have hard time believing that other countries would be happy to lose some of their reserves because of other country trouble . 
  yes but only if people want to invest in uk you do n't usually hear about trade outside uk using pounds do you ? 
  and at least from what i 've seen large corporations open a company in say luxemburg pay taxes there then employ management for the eu branch in uk as they are the best in english ( obviously ) not to mention business friendly and then outsource the production to some other eu with lower production cost ( cheap labor ) countries .
