  it 's very effective way for 3 people to have a job instead of 1 . 
  practiced commonly during communism with many people doing the job one person could do easlly . 
  just keep in mind he was a genocidal maniac , 
  if they won though ... we would be screwed . 
  i pay my taxes !, 
  i demand to see it . 
  if america responds the rest would n't have `` much '' to lose in also responding as america alone could crush russia . 
  if usa did not respond i could see the rest not reacting as they could have trouble with russia . 
  with gigantic colonial empires ? 
  there are some polish putin fans too :d ... ^ ^ * hides ^ ^ in ^ ^ shame *, 
  poland was guaranteed by uk and france kinda making conflict global . 
  with hitler wanting to exterminate our jews and kill half of the rest ca n't see it ending well ... 
  exploitation and mass murder ? 
  same thing really nazis just had better tech for it ... 
  obviously thanks to that our opinion will matter even more in eu , top 5 you know :p, 
  with them separating poland will advance to be 8th most populous country in europe !, 
  can confirm recently heard that a friend of a friend of my sister was briefed on plans to invade kazakhstan ...

  it already happened with poland/germany after ww i, 
  meh we got shit like this for at least a decade . 
  russian nationalists like all nationalists are bad , but comparing them to terrorist organization ? 
  unless you want to blame them for sins of their predecessors which is also stupid ... 
   the defense budget will rise by 1.2 billion euros in 2016 to 34.2 billion and increase to some 35 billion by 2019 , allowing the defense ministry to push ahead with plans to modernize the army , the sources said .

  really ? 
  i can kind of get the start since it 's popular on flags but crescent moon seems to be only on muslim countries flags . 
  surely there is some link between it and islam . 
  well your country have 112 guns per 100 people poland got like 1 so our police would probably become like yours in no time . 
   and if your defense minister is so smart he is a fucking moron . 
  the biggest one of the major pis players i have no clue though how in hell he became a major player anywhere other than a mental clinic . 
  so russia is de jure of poland ? 
  they want nato bases not us bases duh ^ ^ ^ ^ ( lol ), 
  my great great great grandfather was cooler than yours !, 
  i think english is german has most native speakers though, 
  well at least they have it warm in france when they strike ... 
  just like norway : ddd, 
  you did it wrong then it should be '' where are the netherlands in holland ? '', 
  our f-16 purchase was registered under mof rather than defense thus not counting as military spending so not entirely true :p, 
  like us personnel not paying vat ? 
  if they could collect all taxes that should be paid they could lower taxes without reducing spending ? 
  rarely since its expansive but i love me some meat :p,

  did n't the pope die in 2005 ? 
  who is this imposter ? 
  i have no clue if you 're serious or not . 
  does he suggest in his post that he believes they would be good at it ? 
  he simply stated that blaming eu for problems they can not solve is stupid . 
  i mean you are right democratic people republic of north korea is technically democratic, 
  well to be fair when i saw that statistic it was one of the few times in my reddit history that i felt ashamed of the people in poland . 
  obviously not , just mocking the last line . 
  obviously they are different white people are white and brown people are brown obviously . 
  well unfortunately weak are the playthings of the strong . 
  if you do n't want countries in eu to be playthings of china , us and russia you would have to centralize it a lot . 
  why ? 
  im guessing ypg get some of the money for allowing them to pass . 
  wow and i though our politicians are morons ... 
  damn it must have been amazing time on the internet before paid troll profession apeared, 
  well but you have to agree semi-theocracy < military dictatorship,

  yes :p, 
  oh puerto rico is still not a state hehehe calling dibs on 52 !, 
  what ?!, 
  we signed up to be 52nd state not 53rd !, 
  sure the more allied armies in poland the better :p though some might argue that germans would n't be reeealy welcome . 
  personally i would select germans as the ones in those nato bases rather than us to finally kill off this ridiculous notion of evil german nazis . 
  what ? 
  if anything we need less of it . 
  the article has putin in its title so obviously there would be heavy putinbot presence, 
  therefore no plane was shot down in syria , all good . 
  why would n't they ? 
  i mean all of those states would like for assad to keep his position,
