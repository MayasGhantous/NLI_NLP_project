appology for ww2 & post war era crimes would be nice start . 
  what the hell is `` schweden '' ? 
  ok i 'll pass on trying to define geographical borders of europe . 
  i 'll stick to cultural / political europe . 
  http://imgur.com/xwyw5rl blue = cultural europe red line - border of political europe, 
  poland finest http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janusz_korwin-mikke  in his electoral interview to the eu parliament , janusz korwin mikke expressed his belief that hitler did n't know anything about jews ' extermination . 
  jkm also stated that he believes women should not vote , children shall be lashed and putin was right seizing crimea . 
  i 'm fluent in polish ( my native language ) and english . 
  i 'm also able to communicate in german , spanish and russian ( on ** very ** basic level ), 
  there is a joke about radom radom is radom of europe  bada bum tsss, 
   the member states of nato and russia will , together with other states parties , seek to strengthen stability by further developing measures to prevent any potentially threatening build-up of conventional forces in agreed regions of europe , to include central and eastern europe . 
  i guess russian armed forces massed at ukrainian border with large parts of them magicaly appearing on the other side could n't be called threatening build-up of conventional forces . 
  it 's in the last question in transcript :  q : i have a question about -- what 's the president 's position on positioning permanent nato troops or nato bases in the eastern european countries -- for example , in estonia -- or prepositioning some equipment in those areas as some of these analysts and some of the estonian politicians they have called for ? 
   mr. kupchan : i think that the discussions in wales will focus intently on the kinds of measures that need to be taken to reassure estonia and its neighbors , and that we will see more military activity in your part of the world , including training exercises , defense reform , defense capacity building , increasing rotation of nato troops through estonia and through the region in which estonia resides . 
  ** i doubt that we will see movement toward the creation of what one would call permanent forward bases ** . 
  as you probably know , ** there is something called the nato-russia founding act , and that act addressed the question of the setting up of permanent bases ** , and nato is in a situation right now in which it is refraining from moving in that direction . 
  i always thought that i travelled more ... http://imgur.com/0x2uhkx, 
  it has everything : swastikas , ukrainian nazis , blood , evil west and scary obama . 
  i also think it was about soviet uniforms . 
  on the other hand people in poland love russian army choirs , they concert a lot here . 
  well , to be honest , with current political climate , every russian cultural event in poland would gather protestors , shitload of them . 
  i 'm not trying to make any specyfic point . 
  we , people from central/eastern european states can just sit back and take big sip from our `` we told you so '' glass . 
  the mere second the word about it reached kremlin , putin halted any military aid for separatists , pulled russian forces from ru/ukr border and dissolved whole armed forces of russian federation . 
  then he started crying . 
  he reached for his pocket , grabed a key and used it to open locked drawer of his big oak desk . 
  he reached inside and took out his gun . 
  he put it against his head . 
  ' i lost ' - he wispered crying . 
  ' i failed mother russia ' - that was his last thought , whle he pulled the trigger . 
  it 's funny beacuse before their brought down plane with your citizens on board , dutch government was firmly opposing any sanctions against russia . 
  i do n't think that anyone wants seperate passports in polish . 
  polish minority is just asking to allow them to write their names and surnames with polish characters in official documents ( passports , ids etc ), 
  you 're incorrect , to the certain point . 
  does polish imperialism existed during polish - lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  yes . 
  was `` uniting all the slavs '' one of its goals ? 
  sorry to disapoint you but technicaly speaking , polish constitution specifically forbids same sex marriages . 
  on the other hand , it do n't forbid civil union . 
  article 18 of constitution of republic of poland :  ** marriage , being a union of a man and a woman ** , as well as the family , motherhood and parenthood , shall be placed under the protection and care of the republic of poland . 
  something went very , very wrong here . 
  in poland we have bicameral ** parlament ** . 
  lower house - ** sejm ** , upper house - ** senat ** . 
  ** zgromadzenie narodowe ** - is n't a name for legislature . 
  it 's a name used when sejm and senat are called to debate together ( calling up a national assembly ) . 
  baisicly it 's called in one of four cases : * to receive the president 's oath of office * to hear a presidential address * to declare the president 's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health * to bring an indictment against the president to the state tribunal, 
  hash , hash . 
  we like to pretend that pilsudzki was n't a dictator . 
  they did n't need to invade , [ they were already here . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_group_of_forces ), 
   they ca n't be sued for anything it 's not completly true , mp can be arrested and put on trial if they are cought commiting a crime or if sejm votes , to remove someone immunity . 
  but it 's a joke party . 
  i 'll explain it to you in very simple manner . 
  thay had licence for agreed period of time . 
  that period ended . 
  they applied for renewal . 
  we said `` no '' . 
  there is nothing to be sued about . 
  i 'm well aware of that . 
  i never said that german occupation was a good thing . 
  nazis were evil and so were soviets . 
  put yourself in our postion , imagne that after liberation of netherlands , us secret police arrested most of intelectual elite and either shot them in a head and burried them in unmarked graves or send them to the work camps . 
  imagine that they set up puppet goverment , and bullied you into submission . 
  imagine that every one opposing their rule was either killed or dissapeared and was never heared of ever again . 
  imagine living in a totalitarian `` paradise '' , brought to you on bayonets of your `` liberators '' for almost half of a century . 
  sorry but wo n't get even an inch of love for ~ ~ reaping an pillaging ~ ~ glorius red army , from either me or from anybody from other central european country . 
  it has something to do with silly little things like : mass murders , mass deportations , instaling totalitarian dictatorships or stealing people land and heritage . 
  it was n't glorius day . 
  it was the day in which europe was divided and comerade stalin got his filthy hands on almost half of it . 
  russian orthodox church just went full retard . 
  you never should went full retard . 
  yes , for worst . 
  much worst . 
  i always was arguing with my friends that modern russia , despite its interior problems and `` wannabe great empire again '' attitiude is n't threat to european security . 
  it 's xxi century , cold war is over and soviet union is gone . 
  well i was wrong . 
  russian state always will be threat to european security . 
  in poland , \u017candarmeria wojskowa ( military gandarmerie or military police , to be precise ) , acording to new law introduced few years ago , can act as a support for police , when they are called upon . 
  in said situation they act as normal police unit . 
  so far , goverment called mps during some big events ( euro 2012 or 2014 iaaf world indoor championships ) to support police in crowd and traffic control . 
  it 's time to put stop to the aggressive estonian imperialism !, 
  well , not soon . 
  it 's still only a concept - there is long way to go . 
  this video is from chmielnickij oblast , not from kiev, 
  beacuse if government would declared and tried to enforce martial law , the whole situation can spin out control in matter of hours . 
  martial law means more violence , more violence means more deaths and more deaths pretty much means civil war . 
  dear sir , i must admit that your weekly `` fidesz - lets have some laughs ! '', 
  reports are really making my day , week after week . 
  silesian autonomy movement [ ruch autonomii \u015al\u0105ska ] main goal is autonomy within poland , not independence , so you really ca n't label them as separatists . 
  to be more precise , they want to restore [ silesian autonomus voivodeship ] ( http://tinyurl.com/ncvwbdq ) which existed in second polish republic . 
  can you be antisemite in a country without jews ? 
  yes , you can !, 
  welcome to the fascinating world of polish right wing politics !, 
  silesians in poland actually want autonomy , not independence . 
  they have some support , but they lack any real political power . 
  i doubt that it will change in few next decades . 
  let 's just dovnote you into oblivion . 
  without a comment . 
  it was another provocation from russia and its agents . 
  that embassy was standing there on purpose !,
