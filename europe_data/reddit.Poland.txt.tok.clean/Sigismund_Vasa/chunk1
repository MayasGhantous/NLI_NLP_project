how did you calculate polishness/germanness of wroc\u0142aw ? 
  they are someway [ correct ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_great_bulgaria ), 
  `` most likely mieszko i of poland founded the town in the 980s , thereby connecting the polish state ruled by the piast dynasty with the trade routes of the baltic sea '' plus the closest descendants of goths who lived in pomerelia before slavs live now in southern europe ... 
  did poland really do that ? 
  i thought they hated each other 's guts . 
  polish chavs prefer sitting on benches or staircases . 
  no we 're not ( anymore ) . 
  well `` fyrom '' is situated historically in the region of [ macedonia ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_%28region%29 ), 
  i 've heard that people in moldavia also use `` fuck your mother 's onion '' . 
  do they really ? 
  unfortunately a lot of people in poland actually think that both warfare and political situation in eastern europe did n't change even a tiny bit since 17.09.1939 . 
  russia ( however undemocratic it might be now ) is n't ussr . 
  russia did n't even declare ( official ) war on ukraine so why would it invade a nato country all of a sudden ? 
  reminds me a bit of hans mein igel actually . 
  is it a popular destination for school trips ? 
  probably also around 8 % . 
  it 's pretty much the same demographic . 
  i was in bistrita few weeks ago and i have to admit that romania 's really underappreciated . 
  carpathians are just wonderful , cuntryside does n't differ that much from slovakia or eastern poland and roads are n't that bad either . 
  of course there are some shitty estates with almost abandoned blocks but there is also a lot of newly built houses ( most of them not yet plastered for some reason ) . 
  the amount of john paul ii i saw traveling along that country ... ( plus maybe germany and czechia ), 
  and i thought i 'm the only one who hates him . 
   reichenberg was german for a thousand years [ ?

  you could have at least waited for the 1st of september with posting this . 
  or post some other video . 
  this guy 's annoing . 
  i did n't know someone can get that salty about a stupid stereotype . 
  bloody yankees, 
  soo what 's the best way to describe them ? 
  and terrorist is not ? 
  are you really going to nitpick at every single word in my rather shortened definition of terrorism ? 
  they were collaborating with germans . 
  killing drafted soldiers who invaded and now occupy brutally your country is ** resistance ** . 
  plus i would ' t like any german resistance fighters to kill allied soldiers but i would still call them ** resistance fighters ** . 
  even if they they fight for the bad guys . 
  that 's because they were fighting with occupying forces and not shooting to civilians . 
   french terrorists you mean resistance fighters ? 
  goebbels would be proud . 
  i 'm really suprised that there is n't yet a bunch of poles arguing about our prime minister . 
  i thought that 's all we do in the internets, 
  puppet government in occupied poland ? 
  i think he meant teutonic order . 
  liberla right ? 
  like libertarians ? 
  that 's because germany has money . 
  money good . 
  invest in eastern poland, 
  regular inappropriate, 
  you 'd be loved even more if you would gib back wilno ! ^ bloody ^ lithuanian ^ cunts ... / s, 
  says a guy with no flair . 
  flair up so i can mock your country , you bloody ... !, 
  why would russia even want to invade ue ? 
  most , if not all , modern wars are either civil wars caused by religious or ethnic differences or separatist movements . 
  russia is even afraid to officially admit that they help separatists in donbass ; why would they just wage an open war all of a sudden ? 
  even khrushchev was n't that crazy . 
  well that proofs that only sanders/clinton supporters are eager to crash other rallies . 
  i have not heard about sanders ' rally being shut down because of aggresive trump voters . 
  i have to agree that trump should not be asking his supporters to get anti-trump protesters out , but i 'm pretty sure that it 's handled in most cases by security/police . 
  so what ? 
  that does n't make me feel any safer as a european . 
  he was just saying that there is a growing problem with safety in europe . 
  because of the anti-trump protesters . 
  [ you 've seen nothing ... ] ( http://www.zamek-ciechanow.pl/rewit/rewit1.jpg ) . 
  there is a plan to rebuild the ducal castle in ciechan\u00f3w according to [ this project ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/4/8948/z8948264q,zamek-w-ciechanowie---dom-duzy--wedlug-ostatnich-ustalen.jpg ) even though there is enough documentation from renaissance to rebuild it [ like it was ] ( http://www.zamek-ciechanow.pl/rewit/lewicka_1.jpg ) . 
  the `` renovation '' will include building a moat ** inside ** the castle . 
  oh god , [ that abomination of a building stands right next to a gothic church ] ( http://urbnews.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/solpol_foto_barbara_maliszewska.jpg ) . 
  czech republic : [ sma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sma%c5%been%c3%bd_s%c3%bdr ) with tartar sauce and krokety is just perfect . 
  [ `` before wwii poland was a bastion of democracy '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_coup_%28poland%29 ), 
  ok , you 're right , last one might be a bit of an exaggeration . 
  well , that 's the thing . 
  everyone in poland is proud of krak\u00f3w , gda\u0144sk , zakopane etc. 
  but what can you find outside big tourist attractions ? 
  [ sights ] ( http://www.castellum.pl/static/photo/mini/1/443-1143522.jpg ) [ like ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/ae/8b/d5/z13994926q,ponad_300tablic_reklamowych_stoi_na_20_km_drogi_miedzy.jpg ) [ these ] ( http://mojakolej.blox.pl/resource/zielona_gora_ul_kupiecka_westerplatte.jpg ) . 
  i would love poles to care a bit more about their surroundings . 
  i mean all those billboards , pseudo mansions popping up in countryside , historical buildings left in ruins or painted bright-yellow . 
  i seems that almost no one is concerned how does the historical center look like in their own town . 
  but if you ask anyone they will say of course that they 're patriotic . 
  first proper polish state was found by piast dynasty in greater poland , it was always one of the most populous and urbanised provinces of poland . 
  gniezno/pozna \u0144 / giecz were first capitals , but in 11th century wroc\u0142aw , krak\u00f3w and sandomierz also became important . 
  during the reign of kazimierz odnowiciel the capital was moved to cracow , though pozna\u0144 and wroc\u0142aw were still relevant during the fragmentation period ( attempts to reunite poland by henry i the bearded of silesia and przemys\u0142 ii of greater poland ) . 
  warsaw was n't even the capital of masovia at the time . 
  capital was moved there at the end of 16th century so that it would be closer to lithuania . 
  it was still smaller than other major cities in poland . 
  [ and an example of undemocratic art for you . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/pkin_widziany_z_wfc.jpg ) but to be fair , i do n't really understand what you 're trying to prove . 
  was da vinci a great artist just because he lived in a monarchy , was `` artist 's shit '' only created because piero manzoni was able to vote ? 
  is saudi arabia a cultural center of the world ? 
  until around 2010 practically the only liberal party was sld , which consisted mostly of ex-communists . 
  in 2010 janusz palikot founded [ his party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/your_movement ) and it scored 10 % . 
  it was anticlerical , pro-marijuana and all of that but it was disbanded in 2013 . 
  i think nowdays most young people vote for libertarian parties like korwin ( conservative libertarian ) an . nowoczesna ( liberal-libertarian ) because they feel like all the previous ruling parties were just raising taxes and unnecessarily keeping [ zus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zak%c5%82ad_ubezpiecze%c5%84_spo%c5%82ecznych ) alive . 
  i think that left-wing parties in poland either do n't realise that socialism is n't necessarily liked right now or they know that they ca n't compete with korwin and its [ popularity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ps1ilt9rwi ) . 
  `` minority '' but yeah , that 's how it was . 
  gda\u0144sk is slightly out of place ... 
  wot, 
  either czech republic or uk, 
  until now ( i mean like literally few days before election ) we did n't have any liberal parties that would n't have ties with communist regime . 
  there was ruch palikota which got 10 % few years ago but recently it merged with post-communists which might discourged some voters ( like a lot of my friends ) from voting on them . 
  few months ago i also wrote : `` the other thing is that until few years ago polish political scene lacked any libertarian parties .
