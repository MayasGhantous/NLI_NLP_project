  by the logic of this definition they could run to china or australia . 
  the eu structural funds ? 
  talk about comparing apples to oranges . 
  which ones ? 
  mind you they have basic human rights, 
  smart work can be extremely hard , i do not understand what do you mean . 
  no one said they are lazy , they just have huge problems to overcome and until recently there was not enough incentive to work on them or the work was not effective enough . 
  if population was against a change , work on changing their perception . 
  the world changes around you whole the time , definitions not always apply to current conditions . 
  case and point : war in ukraine . 
  no you are not your ancestors but you benefit from their sacrifices and hard work . 
  why do you think arab spring happened ? 
  it was not in order to improve their immediate living but to give opportunities to their children and grandchildren . 
  exactly what your ancestors worked on . 
  it 's not only a matter of physical work . 
  if you disagree with some legislation you are free to work on changing it . 
  europeans worked on our rights for centuries , even by means of revolutions and blood spill . 
  i agree with the statement . 
  you are free to pay them in order to improve their conditions . 
  immigrants have ** no ** right to improving their living conditions . 
  they have the right to escape war and prosecution . 
  eu can facilitate change in middle east but we are under no obligation to improve their lives . 
  we have our own to take care of . 
  should poor people have the right to apply for asylum ? 
  once leaving the first safe country they are forfeiting their refugee status because by then they are not running from anything , they run towards . 
  i do n't see myself obliged to make anyone prosperous by the means of my taxes . 
  if they do n't accept their living conditions they are welcome to earn improvement . 
  i do n't mean to be an ass but basic logic provides this . 
  if they were refugees they would stop where they are safe from war . 
  they riot and demand a way to germany and sweden . 
  those are faaaar away from the warzone . 
  they have ** no ** right to demand where they should be settled . 
  seriously , i thought that within those 3 nations at least 2 would be from v4 . 
  ca n't ... stop ... watching ... 
  agreed , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  it 's media trying to equate one with the other . 
  that 's what i had in mind . 
  it could actually look * decent * if it were clean . 
  that might be the actual problem with the numbers shown . 
  those 7k protesters are both far right racists and people not radical that did n't mind joining them . 
  silent majority has its own opinion but stays at home ( both pro and against immigration ) . 
  we really need to finally wash it ... edit : [ the palace looks rather good when lit up at night ] ( http://img4.garnek.pl/a.garnek.pl/013/934/13934935_800.0.jpg/centrum-warszawy-noca.jpg ), 
  thanks for the friedman talk video . 
  quite interesting that what he was saying just 3 years ago we can see happening now . 
  eu disagreeing , v4 being actually a thing , russia flexing muscles ... 
  scary shit . 
  now i need to read it . 
  i 'm glad i found this comment train down here . 
  i was wondering for a second what is going on when i saw thread being delisted . 
  upvoted for visibility . 
  poland indeed could accept say 10k * refugees * , no one denies them asylum but everyone runs around calling illegal immigrants refugees . 
  those two are extremely different . 
  i 'd venture a guess that you would n't find opposition to grabbing 10k * refugees * from refugee camps in turkey and relocating them to poland until the war is over . 
  likewise you would n't find an opposition to paying for camps in turkey . 
  mandatory quotas want to throw us couple thousand immigrants . 
  they do n't want to be here , we do n't want them here and it 's not going to work like that . 
  besides expected numbers of immigrants to reach europe are constantly being raised , so the 10k quota would be a one time of multiple quota . 
  official stats are `` close to 1000 '' for pro immigration and 7000 against, 
  fucking finally . 
  banning an opinion that has ` some ' coverage in facts is retarded . 
  * people * are not inherently better or worse that the other . 
  there 's hoping they wo n't have as much power over constitution . 
  so ww2 fixed ww1 for germany ... by that logic to fix ww2 ... 
  no you 're not , do n't lie . 
  embrace it . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ laughed, 
  [ relevant ( first 30sec ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l62m2e6wcw8 ), 
   what the fuck is wrong with these guys anyway ? 
  it 's always far-right or far-left with them . 
  is there no middle in germany ? 
  right ? 
  i noticed that too . 
  nowadays they ca n't even raise their voice , that 's how pacifist they are . 
  why do we actually need submarines ? 
  buying those and maintaining them is a pain . 
  yeah , well , it 's been so common throughout the history they named such an incident . 
  i believe it 's called ' a sin ' ;-) on a serious note , it 's not unusual and i do n't blame them ; current christian values are good for utopias , not the state of affairs we have nowadays . 
  if you want eu to be abused sure , be a good christian . 
  we will see shortly how such politics pans out . 
  i 'm not angry , i 'm frustrated that everyone is avoiding making a stance . 
  that 's the correct answer . 
  i got that . 
  they do n't need help as understood under refugee status , they are migrating for work and/or benefits in germany . 
  yeah , you go first . 
  war refugees should be put in camps and wait for war to be over . 
  illegal immigrants should be either not let in or put in the very same camps . 
  no exiting the camps until the war is over . 
  current situation is beyond ridiculous . 
  never heard of that , thank you . 
  deport those people to locked down refugee camps . 
  australia managed this issue some time ago . 
  i just want to say thank you for keeping up on posting in ttip threads . 
  you 're always cool headed while repeating yourself over and over and taking heat . 
  while i disagree with your stance on the matter i 'll always gladly read your posts . 
  thanks . 
  the long con . 
  was n't there a case against a homeless guy when he was insulting president komorowski ? 
  i mean if i were to report him , prosecutors would have to take the case . 
  whether they would go out of their way to press any charges or not would be up to them . 
  most likely not but still ... and no i do n't like laws against free speech but it ai n't one .
