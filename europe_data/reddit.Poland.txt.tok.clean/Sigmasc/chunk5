  no partying for me ... 
  as someone who just learned about this historical significance , this naming is confusing as hell . 
  you expect everyone who comes here to explain everything in few paragraphs ? 
  the way i see it , i contributed by warning everyone that what op says is sensationalist and untrue, 
  i 'm sorry but when someone 's saying the sky is green you just call bullshit without explaining the physics of it . 
  besides it was explained by others what 's wrong with that . 
  that 's borderline sensationalist and you 're just making stuff up . 
   which was then corrected to lebensraum . 
  we are discussing whether or not lebensraum has bad connotations . 
  you 're saying it 's a perfectly normal word in german which i agree to but am arguing that it 's a very stigmatized word outside of german vocabulary and is what op meant . 
  sure but that does n't fit the context of this conversation started by  a hugging friend nato is just an extension of hitler 's policy of ** lebenrauch ** . 
  which was then corrected to lebensraum . 
  you correctly pointed out that lebensraum is a perfectly normal word in german but neither in previous posts nor in the op 's quote lebensraum was used as a german word but as a connotation to nazi and their meaning of ` lebensraum ' . 
  it might not have a strong connotation in german speaking countries but it has outside . 
  especially since pop culture picked it up and propagated . 
   polish deep religiousness is mostly statistical one at this point . 
  yeah can confirm . 
  while church attendance might still be high many of us are christian only on paper . 
  heck , there is a running joke that confirmation rite is a ` farewell to church rite ' . 
  church wedding is a big part of our culture and since you need the confirmation , well , so be it . 
   up to ~ 50 % wanting to limit it to situations involving rape , incest and health issues . 
  but that 's actually what the law says now . 
   just because some nazis had ideology using that word does not mean that it 's still problematic . 
  then why is swastika banned ( in germany ) ? 
  it 's a symbol like any other [ ( dated back to 10,000 bc ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika ) , say christian cross . 
  connotations so strong do not disappear . 
  it 's worse actually . 
  we have no direct input on the matter and it 's behind closed doors . 
  i just want to say that i love everything about this conversation . 
  [ i present to you : bob ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mciiz3hgpva ), 
  it would be interesting to see a clash of us and eu laws/interests . 
   i cringe whenever poland gains more influence in the eu - i was born and raised here and know what that might lead to . 
  it 's not our culture that is gaining influence . 
  we 've been under communism for almost 50 years , that 's 2 generations that had n't progressed like the west did and on top of that our intelligence ( as in highly educated people ) got a huge axe during wwii . 
  go on the street and ask young ( ! ), 
  people what they think of homosexuals and you will see a huge shift in mentality . 
  as cruel as it may sound , we need to let our elders die out to be more progressive . 
  it 's mostly the older , more religious , closed minded generation . 
  similar thing goes with over 90 % being catholic . 
  sure almost everyone has been baptized so on paper it looks like 90 % is catholic but the reality is quite different . 
  it 's a piece of our culture now . 
  requirements ? 
  maybe , but we need a willing parliament to do so . 
  we need to change our constitution which requires 2/3 majority . 
  if i may add : preferably gained if not the same . 
  oh and please do n't make a nuclear wasteland out of us . 
  sorry , i was n't jumping on you , i meant my poorly written sentences as an agreement . 
   russians where in russia of course silly . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ were ^ ^ ^ asking ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ it . 
  i will need a truckload of popcorn to watch that . 
  [ it 's due to infrastructure . 
  where is business there people are more content . 
  old age is not a cause . 
  it 's all that old age brings that 's killing you . 
  then why not choose a dictator ? 
  give him all the totalitarian rights except from control of military , courts and election committee . 
  military would keep him/her in check , courts would see that he gets a fair trial if needed and election committee oversees referendums for his/her removal if that 's what people want . 
  it is actually doable , all we need is will to do so ... and a guy to manage a whole country singlehandedly . 
  department of redundancy department would like to have a word with you . 
  there 's nothing wrong in being a dictator as long as you 're doing it right . 
  dictatorship has bad connotations ( due to the past ... and present ) but it is really a great way to govern . 
  for the record , i 'm not being sarcastic . 
  pis even if wins wo n't form a ruling majority because they wo n't cooperate and everyone saw what happened to guys who worked with them - they got swallowed ( for others : pis won 2005 elections and formed government with 2 smaller parties . 
  those parties ' electorate moved to support pis and now the two are out of the parliament ) . 
  i 'm voting for po even though i disagree with many things because there is no alternative . 
  i disagree . 
  while pis was in charge of things , our relationships with other countries were n't that good . 
  they presented the `` we demand '' politics and that would n't score us many points on the eu level leading to less money attributed . 
  god i hope it 's terminal . 
  i 'm sorry but both links are working for me . 
  when i opened them and saw them i thought `` they look like shit , maybe that 's what he meant by broken '' but then i read it was about `` united states considers the prime suspect in ** last week 's ** terrorist attacks on new york and '' and figured the looks of it being 2000-ish are correct . 
  i forgot to put my tinfoil hat today . 
  sure many countries had their own programs , sure they cooperated but i doubt chancellor knew they were tapping her phone too . 
  as a de facto head of a country you would n't willingly accept that . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  i do n't really know how media spinned it in germany or whether they remind the public about the fact but taken steps like this law say they are doing something about it . 
  [ * never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . 
  it did bother one person who happens to be a chancellor . 
  besides it does piss off germans , not german government . 
   will it create yet another world wide web , censored , like in china , to protect users from knowing too much ? 
  at the moment it 's the americans that are headed that way . 
  we do at least have ( or soon to have ) a strong net neutrality law . 
  i like the way eu is protecting our data but the idea that anything could be removed from the internet is absurd . 
  once something hits the internet , stays on the internet , period . 
  right to be forgotten would have to be international law for it to have teeth . 
  that would get them off the hook of american jurisdiction , would n't it ? 
  also any data handed over by the subsidiary would that much more piss off germans and fines would be that much greater ( including espionage i assume ) . 
  i think there 's cause and effect somewhere in there . 
  we are n't in a hurry to be frank . 
  sure we are obliged to enter the eurozone but since there 's a shitstorm in there we are n't really rushing to do so . 
  i think the 2009 boss would be more fitting . 
   humans can not be even trusted with a simple task like flushing i giggled ; and then i became sad because it 's true . 
  ( aside from that being more hygienic ), 
  woah , til . 
  why is that ? 
  what 's wrong with krakow ? 
  or warsaw for that matter ?
