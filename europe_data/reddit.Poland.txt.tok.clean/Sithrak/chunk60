  scooter ? 
  not applicable to everyone , but you never know, 
  would make even more sense if poland did anything at all to alleviate its coal dependency . 
  and yet poles voted out the government of the last 8 years and claimed that `` everything is horrible '' . 
  poland . 
  ever great at judging things . 
  oh god no . 
  not going to educate people ignorant of overwhelming scientific consensus . 
  yes , it is a major issue , but it wo n't irradiate our country just like that . 
   why they do n't build nuclear power plants is a mystery to me . 
  incompetence , coal lobby , ignorance , nimby , lack of political will . 
  we kinda got much better at not-irradiating countries since chernobyl , you know . 
  nuclear plants are built nowadays in a way where you have to constantly work for it not to shut down . 
  even the recent fukushima disaster was caused by the * strongest earthquake in japanese history * and a huge-ass tsunami hitting the nuclear plant . 
  these are a bit rare in poland . 
  or even invest in renewables , if nuclear is too hard . 
  poland is not the optimal place for most renewable options , but we sure could do much more than we do now . 
  well , we can ponder those perfectly solvable problems for another decade or two . 
  as / u/wonglik said , lack of political will . 
  the ignorance towards climate change in poland probably only rivals that of us republicans . 
  and no , climate change is happening now , not in 80 years . 
  we are getting record droughts and floods already . 
  i am certain it would be hard to explain to a poor african villager that poaching last lions or rhinos is not very good . 
  humans will always need to strip and destroy everything , when they are poor . 
  with po being a zombie at least since presidential elections , the po/pis vote split is less interesting than it was , say , in the two previous elections . 
  essentially , this map follows a first-past-the-post rule ( not linked to actual voting ) and so is n't very informative considering how many parties competed . 
   you only know things presented to you by the western media , which is completely biased towards liberal conservatism / free-market capitalism , because the owners are rich businessmen , and this is what jobbik stands against . 
  not saying non-hungarian sources represent jobbik very well , but please do not paint it as a fight against some grand capitalist conspiracy . 
  europe and even america have plenty of major media outlets that are against or highly critical of free-market capitalism and corporate power . 
  most of distortion about hungary ( and poland , for that matter ) is caused by lack of interest , not some agenda . 
  this as well as attitudes to refugees constantly remind me that the term `` eastern europe '' is very much alive and well , as a cultural phenomenon . 
  used to happen in poland a lot , but seems to have quieted down in the last decade or so . 
  praise be . 
  you are a lab rat for endless experiments trying to make the world economy work , regardless of left wing or right wing approaches . 
  my point was simply that there is no single economic outlook that has been proven to be `` correct '' . 
  of course , leftist governments have a huge potential for idiocy just as well . 
  venezuela is my absolute favorite . 
  `` empiricial evidence '' ? 
  the world is not a lab . 
  economy has not been `` solved '' . 
  every success and failure , be it right-wing or left-wing , was accompanied by countless additional uncontrolled variables . 
  we have not fully cracked the human biology . 
  we do n't even fully understand the psychology of a single human . 
  we do n't fully get the sociology , that is the behavior of human masses . 
  we still do n't comprehend the extent of cultural interactions . 
  and economy is just another layer on top of that . 
  it is not solved , not even close . 
  on the other hand , he has less tax dollars and so can start getting into a crippling debt faster . 
  sure , it can make sense ( even though i disagree with them ) . 
  it just does not conform to some prevalent left-right labels . 
  they can , however , grant sweeping rights to natural resources , labor and tax breaks to their business chums , with little regard for their citizens . 
  instead of corrupt state monopoly , you get a brutal exploitative business oligarchy . 
  different label , similar bullshit , citizens screwed . 
  poor countries get poorer if their rulers are dumb . 
  their ideology is secondary to their corruption and incompetence . 
  a ruler being right-wing wo n't help you if they fail to manage cash flows properly . 
  `` left-wing '' does not mean `` communism '' . 
  it is a wide field , from which also right-wing parties draw , and the communist version you describe is only an extreme option that no one serious in the west advocates . 
  is the economy a binary choice between `` free market '' and `` socialism '' ? 
  or is it , perhaps , a wide spectrum of various solutions from all possible schools of thought , with every country drawing from a range of economic inspirations , regardless of how they define it ? 
  i like how even you , an admitted commie hater , admit that `` nationalist '' is a negative term . 
  those dirty commies won , man . 
  commies won . 
  this is not true . 
  only a minority of polish voters can be actually classified as `` religious '' . 
  plenty are socially conservative , though , but non-religious or anti-church stances are present even in the new parliament . 
  nowoczesna , for example , wants to heavily curtail church privileges , despite being `` right-wing '' . 
  po also has some secular-minded folks , though it is a mixed party . 
  parties of all coloration wasted their chances . 
  you say sld and palikot ? 
  i say aws and previous disastrous pis rule . 
  arguably , the most successful rule was that of po and now they were utterly destroyed , lol . 
  glad to hear the right-wing ideas are the divine truth . 
  polish parties are messed up and defy traditional classifications . 
  neither were previous left-wing parties actually leftist , nor are the current right-wing parties fully rightist . 
  the winner , ** pis ** is very traditionalist socially , but promise a sweeping welfare state . 
  sadly , a dumb deficit-driven version of it . 
  a new party , ** nowoczesna ** , are free-market zealots who also dislike church dominance . 
  main left-wing post-communist party who lost in these elections , ** sld ** ( part of zl coalition on the ballot ) , was de facto rather conservative , pro free-market , great fans of the american war on terror and anti-immigrant . 
  another outgoing party , ** twoj ruch ** ( part of zl coalition in these elections ) , wanted legal weed , burn the churches , abortion for everyone , but were also for pro free market and hugging the job creators . 
  so , while we might lack self-defined left , left-wing positions are both very much present in the new parliament and were already absent during the previous term , depending on where you stand . 
  so the society and the economy have been `` solved '' and the conclusion is that right-wing is the only truth ? 
  of course there is historical rivalry and actual russophobic stances exist . 
  pis , the party who just won in poland , is definitely russophobic . 
  i consider any such nation-specific phobia dumb . 
  but reactions to powers mostly come from their actions . 
  the same happened with america - wars in iraq and afghanistan , rendition , guantanamo etc. 
  caused huge waves of anti-american sentiment in europe , something that still partially remains . 
  same with russia . 
  people are mostly pissed about putin 's actions in ukraine , downing of that passenger plane , poisoning of litvinienko , magnitsky case etc. 
  and not by some prejudice . 
  hell , germany was one of the most pro-russian countries in europe until recently . 
  pussy riot case was noted not because people agree with what they did - most people do n't like punk performers yelling in major temples . 
  but the punishment they received was disproportional and this is what caused all the outrage . 
  i mean , years of prison for a juvenile protest disturbance ? 
  that 's crazy for most europeans . 
  so you reduce current european antipathy towards putin to russophobia ? 
  or is it possible that many people just really , really dislike putin 's actions ? 
  are you implying he is not playing power politics and that he does not see eu as a rival entity that he would prefer to be disunited ? 
  i would find it very hard to believe .
