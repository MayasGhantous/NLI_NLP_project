im just saying that most media is bullshit . 
  this is really crazy , but fox and friends do shit like this all the time . 
  hahahahahaha ... no . 
  sorry , but you clearly have no idea what you are talking about . 
  hey , britain , it 's better together !, 
   ( i was very amused by that campaign , you could swap `` scotland '' with `` eu '' for pretty much everything they said , and it still worked !, 
  [ counterpoint ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xorha/timothy_snyder_since_2013_putins_main_foreign/ ), 
  oh yea , i see that each time flying between poland and uk . 
  these beautiful wind farms , 
  thank you . 
  uk is surprisingly low . 
  i do n't follow too many eu politicians on twitter , but [ @jsaryuszwolski ] ( https://twitter.com/jsaryuszwolski ) , epp vice-president , seems to be quite decent . 
  he is a pole , but posts plenty of stuff in english . 
  yea , i follow him too , he posts plenty of great stuff , though he is not an eu politician . 
  and still generating less co2 per capita than germany !, 
  now beat that !, 
  kasparov have been posting many opinions loudly speaking up against putin . 
  if you 're on twitter it 's worth observing him here : https://twitter.com/kasparov63, 
  an excellent talk . 
  listened to all of it , and tbh : i ca n't think of anything to disagree with . 
  several of these issues were highlighted by different authors , but rarely you see one person putting all of it in one coherent talk . 
  i really wish more people would become aware of this context of the events . 
  yea , i 'm still shocked how the heck did it happen that all of them got into the parliament at the same time . 
  and now mr. biedro\u0144 is a mayor of a city . 
  these are one of those rare events when i 'm totally positively surprised by what awesome things poles can come up with . 
  more progressive than any other parliament in the eu !, 
  hehe, 
  uk has lagoons now ?!, 
   and generate as much as 8 percent of the uk 's total power . 
  wow ... out of 6 tidal powerplants ? 
  is n't that slightly too optimistic estimation ? 
  hahahaha , great video . 
  guy speaks truth . 
  but way too old . 
  not just her . 
  epp vice-chair & eu commissioner sandra kalniete , [ polish ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xp05i/kremlin_denies_polish_officials_entry_to_russia/ ) and few other delegations were denied entry for the funeral . 
  seems that russians are planning to blockade any eu representation . 
  nothing unexpected , but still sad . 
  here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xcfmh/yes_i_am_a_russian_occupant_antiwest_propaganda/ we already have a topic about that video with a very lengthy discussion and plenty of upvotes . 
  that 's true for vast majority of countries where christianity is a dominant religion . 
  notable exception being holy see . 
  read my post carefully . 
  when christianity was born in the middle east - there was no eu . 
  when eu was born - christianity was absolutely dominant religion in the eu , making it basically a native religion of the european union . 
  whatever you want it or not - christianity is the native religion in the eu , islam is foreign to us , much like buddhism is . 
  it 's changing recently , yes , but none the less - comparison with poland or ireland is very much missing the mark . 
  arguably china possess more land in europe than turkey , if you 'll add all of the private land owned by chinese * investors * across the eu . 
   but ... but ... they participated in eurovision !, 
  on that basis i demand australia joining the eu before turkey . 
  lol, 
  [ we do have that ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wydobycie_ropy_naftowej_w_polsce ) , just not nearly as much as texas does . 
  ^ ( sorry for article in polish , feel free to use google translate ), 
  but ... [ brussels is already a capital city of the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brussels_and_the_european_union ) . 
  amusing considering that saving your own teeth tends to be much more expensive than buying gold teeth . 
   that changed when they realized hitler was even more of a dick than stalin was . 
  [ debatable ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_famine_of_1932%e2%80%9333 ) . 
  by a sheer number of casualties it 's likely that a famine in 1932 alone caused more deaths of ukrainians than whole ww2 did , including causalities on both sides . 
  and then there were other victims of stalinism in ukraine - both : before and after the war . 
  in poland it 's both . 
  only cop cars can catch you anywhere , and speed cameras are located in publicly known locations ( some of our sat nav systems got warnings when you approach speed camera ) . 
  i 'd prefer ... both . 
  that seems like an optimal solution . 
  only imho putting speed cams on a roads and then publishing locations online is rather counter-productive . 
  if we 're paying for a speed cams from our taxes - these better would fulfil their role of catching speeding drivers . 
  perhaps then we 'd finally get rid of this stupid culture of driving constantly above the speed limit . 
  it 's not the same without guns :(, 
  ahh , these vampires ... o_o :p, 
   the blame is on europe why ? 
  it 's police and french government to blame for doing nothing to check these migrants and kick them hell out if they are not allowed to be there or if they 're destroying any property / stealing . 
  in-country checks are fully allowed and legal in europe . 
   uk citizens do n't have an id card so they ca n't be asked by the police to show their papers that 's not a problem . 
  british citizens tend to speak english fluently and have passports . 
  everyone who does n't have an id card or passport should be automatically stopped by a police for investigation regardless of what nationality he or she declares . 
  that should allow you to catch good 99.9 % of migrants . 
  schengen zone is just an excuse used by police and government for not doing anything . 
  and fyi : ** uk and ireland are not a part of schengen ** . 
  nice renders . 
  though it looks unrealistic . 
  good old days of \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 are long gone , since the fall of soviet union russia created only 1 new military transport plane - medium an-70 which was worked on back in a soviet days . 
  there is a second one being worked on - tiny il-112 which still is n't ready even though it was suppose to fly already in 2011 . 
  i would have my doubts about this plane if it 'd be airbus showing that render and telling us that they 'll build it in 2024 , but russians ? 
  sorry , not a chance . 
  it 's suppose to carry up to 200 tons , so a middle ground between [ an-225 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonov_an-225_mriya ) and [ an-124 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonov_an-124_ruslan ) . 
  supplies can be delivered using conventional methods . 
  i imagine it 's more about delivering tanks from factories to the russian borders or from one military district to another than delivering them to the front line . 
  russian military right now is build very much towards rapid response capabilities , so it sort-of makes sense . 
  fyi truck drivers in general despise calais . 
  these migrants rob them of food , damage cargo , damage trailers , even climb on a trailers and cut through to get * smuggled * inside . 
  i know a guy who owns transport company - he lost thousands of euro in calais due to immigrants damaging property . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  and if police finds anyone in a truck or trailer - it 's a driver who 's accountable . 
  so this footage is not shocking at all . 
  drivers react in only way they can . 
  great , i can only dream of having a long weekends like that . 
  that 's true for every country in the statistic . 
  netherlanders work 30 hours on average ... that 's 6 hours a day mon-fri ... . makes me jealous . 
  this and a fact that the percentage of reported cases varies from country to country . 
   for the purposes of our coming coverage , we will assume that the scientific consensus about man-made climate change and its likely effects is overwhelming . 
  wait ... what ? 
  '' * for the purposes of our coming coverage * '' ?
