  nothing got `` ruined '' unless you 're looking back before '70s . 
  there 's plenty of shops accepting euro in border areas or biggest tourist centres ( eg . 
  also almost all payment terminals will accept foreign credit or debit cards , so if you have a card with an account in euro you can pay almost everywhere . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_da_si%c4%99_lubi%c4%87 ) , you can search youtube for title of the show , there are [ full episodes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhbzz4dvyz0 ) available . 
   many eu websites and programs are only available in the big three languages ( en , fr , de ) , and if you only speak one of the smaller languages , you 're screwed . 
  hopefully since joining eu there 's no child that would grow up knowing just one language . 
  and if he knows two languages - it 's almost unthinkable for one of them not to be english , german or french . 
  as for everyone else - eu should n't force them to learn languages . 
  but in modern world it 's more than clear that knowing english is very , very desirable . 
  just wait 2 generations and english will be lingua franca whether you want it or not . 
  ( unless something dramatic happens ... hopefully not ), 
  before ( & after ) the referendum about joining eu we 've had a tv show called ' * europe can be liked * ' ( pardon my rough translation ) that invited german , brit , frenchwoman , spaniard , italian , and guys/girls from few other countries that lived in poland for several years to talk in a fun way about various customs , habits , holidays & other stuff in their countries . 
  it did an amazing job warming up the view of average * westerner * and making people feel connected to the rest of europe , even if it was often times done through stereotypes . 
  so yea - having that positive view of even an individual , ' * token german * ' , might be a great start to bring out some positive emotions towards rest of the europe . 
  and while we see americans through mass media as a superheroes , rich , beautiful , explorers of space , we almost never have a chance to see other europeans through mass media in positive roles . 
  then why not call yourself a * patriot * ? 
  word that does n't have any connotations towards a political ideology that * nationalist * does . 
  it 's a specific choice one makes , one that brings additional luggage , even if there are specific , albeit narrow , branches that discard certain elements of it . 
  well , suppose i 'll bite , at least for this one post . 
  it 's not comparable . 
  being a socialist specifically identifies you with a political ideology , being nationalist in a meaning that / u/tonygaze quoted - '' * patriotic feeling , principles , or efforts * '' does not . 
  if that 's the meaning you have in mind - one without political ideology - then the natural question is why not to describe yourself as a patriot ? 
  if it 's one that specifically implies political ideology then , at least for me , there 's nothing positive in it that could n't be accomplished by other , much more moderate ideologies , and nationalism as such ranges from barely acceptable ( eg . 
  civic nationalism ) to cancerous ( eg . 
  racial , neo - ) ideologies in modern world . 
  for me there 's a clear distinction between patriotism and nationalism . 
  if someone 's patriotic - i 'm cool with that . 
  if someone 's choosing to call himself specifically nationalistic - it comes with all that luggage like xenophobia , racism , sexism , your nation being superior to other nation , etc. 
  redditors should stop equating nationalism with patriotism . 
  can not into space . 
  african english accents were always by far most problematic for me . 
  second place probably thick indian accents . 
  no big issues with british/scottish accents , surprisingly . 
  i might be a weirdo , but female english with irish accent was always the most beautifully sounding language for me . 
  as long as the most prevalent type of journalism is `` he said , she said '' - i doubt anything will change . 
  media are not interested in fact-checking and this gives politicians free reign over what they can blame on who . 
  so obviously exporting faults outside of your government is preferable and rewarding thing to do . 
  poland : it falls under art . 
  16 of the police law - basically : attempt to use physical , technical ( eg . 
  tasers ) or chemical ( eg . 
  tear/pepper gas ) force to disable the subject . 
  that also includes non-penetrating rounds ( rubber ) , though police never has them on a casual patrols and would n't use in a case like that ( they wou in this case , reasonably thinking , person in question would be disabled and a firearm would be taken away . 
  however if he would still resist arrest - police is authorised to use firearms based on art . 
  17 point 2 - person declines to drop firearms or other deadly tool . 
  now , how would the scene like this look like in poland : policeman has to shout `` police !, 
  '' , call him to drop the weapon , if it fails - shout again `` freeze or i 'll use the weapon '' - if he will freeze then police is * not * authorized to use firearm and has to take the weapon away or disable the subject by other means ( art . 
  16 as described above ) . 
  that 's the end of the event . 
  if he would n't comply - policeman has to fire a warning shot before shooting the suspect . 
  even if he would be fired upon - it 'd be a disabling shot , * if * he would be hit at all ( that 's a big if - police uses firearms so rarely that they lack in skill and training . ), 
  now , speculating a bit more : this lack of skills is also an important factor in decision making process - they 're much more likely to use non-lethal force even if they are authorized to use firearms . 
  however someone that looks like a foreigner , is impossible to communicate with , and has a firearm would give a response that 's difficult to predict - either fear of terrorism will win , fear of international scandal will win or training will win . 
  it 'd be such a rare event that it 's impossible to predict the outcome . 
  [ edit ] oh , gold , thank you , though i really do n't deserve it , i 'm not an expert on a topic . 
  also : pardon for my shitty english  . 
  lol . 
  you really think that eu would force refugees on countries with a power of it 's army ? 
  name checks out , i see . 
  yes , sure , i am . 
  we grew up from city-states , we 'll grow up from countries , and looking far in future - we 'll grow up from federations of countries into a planetary government , or perhaps even leap right into multi-planetary governments as we 'd expand beyond our home world and even further in future - beyond solar system . 
  pretending that there 's something special in countries that makes them ethernal form of top-level government is naive , to say at least . 
  neighbor from where my parents used to live used kurwa as a comma in sentences . 
  and '' * napojony * '' for not being thirsty any more ( though it 's used mostly for animals , when referring to humans it 's considered ... funny ), 
  generally they focus on deprecating eu . 
  they also try to push isolationism - germans are just as dangerous as russians , we should defend western border as much as eastern , we should n't buy any equipment from the west but rather build and design ourselves , making [ western betrayal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal ) look like one of top-2 most important things in the entire history of poland ( another one being [ volhynian massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) ) , saying that we should be economically 100 % self-sufficient ( there 's one copy-pasta i seen a few times with links to how our self-sufficiency is falling ) , how evil west is taking over polish companies ( oftentimes followed by calls for nationalization ) , some talks about how we should quit the eu and start intermarum ( rarely directly , oftentimes though it 's implied , with varying member states , v4 being one more common option ) , over-blowing comments from individual politicians with the aim to make them look like an official eu stance ( eg . 
  recent comment from luxembourg foregin minister about expelling hungary from the eu ( which was not even an official stance of luxembourg ) , oftentimes followed by a remark on how it 's inevitable to have the same happening to poland because xyz ) , equaling strong government with good or soft government with bad ( again , ru = good , eu = bad ) , creating fear of muslim immigrants flooding poland if eu ever integrates further , etc. 
  when war in ukraine was at it 's peak they also talked a lot about how crimea was never ukrainian soil , but that never really gained any grip , and attacking any actions of politicians ( regardless if government or not ) that were aimed at supporting ukrainian territorial integrity and democracy . 
  oh , there 's also been some comments about cia staging maidan , but that never gained much grip either . 
  in general it 's a little bit different than in other countries , because some attacks do n't really work here - people are more ... sensitive to stuff that 's obviously pro-russian , and do n't react positively to anti-americanism , but if you package it in some nationalistic or anti-party box - it tends to get a positive response . 
  as for how they ( propagandists ) are called - usually '' * 5th column * '' or '' * russian < insert curseword of choice  * '' . 
  also it 's often implied that they get paid for commenting , but that 's the case also in national politics , so to distinguish - people make references to ruble . 
  if anyone 's interested what missions specifically are a mega projects (  = $ 1 billion ) : * upcoming cosmic vision l-class missions ( [ juice ] ( http://sci.esa.int/juice/50067-mission-summary/ ) , [ athena ] ( http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/54517-athena/ ) , [ elisa ] ( https://www.elisascience.org/articles/elisa-mission/elisa-mission-gravitational-universe ) ) * already operational horizon 2000 mission : rosetta * other : [ envisat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/envisat ) , [ herschel space observatory ] ( http://sci.esa.int/herschel/ ) , [ bepicolombo ] ( http://sci.esa.int/bepicolombo/ ) * international missions led by other agency/agencies : hubble and james webb space telescopes , international space station , [ soho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_and_heliospheric_observatory ) * also if you want to count larger programmes : galileo satellite navigation , [ copernicus / sentinel satellites ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/observing_the_earth/copernicus/overview4 ) , [ exomars ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/space_science/exomars/what_is_exomars ) , [ atvs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automated_transfer_vehicle ), 
   juncker just proposed the construction of an ** enormous ** eu military headquarters . 
  afaik : that never happened . 
  matter of where and how large hq would be is not even close to resolution . 
  i would n't expect it to be any sort of `` megaproject '' - even [ new nato hq ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49287.htm ) is not a megaproject ( generally a cost of $ 1 billion is considered to be the point where megaprojects begin ) . 
  as for talking with foreigners - i usually try to switch into the english form of my first name as soon as possible , cause pronouncing my surname ... well ... god have mercy over the soul of any foreigner attempting to do that . 
  it would . 
  then again : people got used so much to calling east-west split that they struggle to imagine that north-centre-south might exist . 
  yep . 
  i can visit guiana space center with my national id card , no need for passport , i do n't know why but it makes me extra-happy . 
  pardon , meant hdi , already edited to fix it . 
  as for average income - russia is nowhere near , no idea where you got that . 
  that 's why i included two other factors . 
  poland is too large . 
  with over 38 million people it has so much inertia that i would n't be surprised if it 'd be the last country of 2004 enlargement to catch west in average income , gdp per capita , hdi . 
  some do , some do n't ... 
  yep . 
  and it 's fine with foreign corporations extracting it . 
  just ... not russian . 
   do you really consider than an original and/or interesting conversation topic ?

  you should really look up a definition of mass murder before posting bs like that . 
   they could n't reach northern england ( several ports ) let alone scotland ( plenty more ports ) from northern france , they could n't because of many reasons ( most notably : lack of air superiority combined with radar ) , but from purely technical point of view - they could have . 
  germany got bombers with a 6000 km range ( eg . 
  [ ju 290 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junkers_ju_290 ) ) , distance from calais in france to northern scotland does n't exceed 1200km . 
  only problem to solve after achieving air superiority would be in making sure that british navy does n't get close to continental europe . 
  that 's all they needed to land invasion and that could be done quite easily with a bit of help from [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radar_in_world_war_ii#germany ) ( [ 200km range ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seetakt_radar ) if you 're lucky ) and having a bulk of their air force relocated from east to france .
