  nightmare man . 
  nightmare . 
  i invite you to polish train operated by `` pkp przewozy regionalne '' in a middle of the winter . 
  you 'll have a nightmare redefined . 
  yep . 
  the high percentage of nationalists in general population also checks out . 
  very nice overview of the situation . 
  i heard about few of the things mentioned in the article ( eg . 
  italians being outraged on tusk 's twitt stating simple facts they refused to accept ) , but it 's really nice to have all of this in one place . 
  overall i would say that he is fulfilling my hopes for his presidency . 
  perhaps not as quickly as i 'd like it to be , and not as smoothly ( eg . 
  lack of attendance to the general affairs councils is a very bad decision ) but i for one agree with pretty much every major decision he tried to push for , and i 'm most glad to see him building an active role for the president of the european council as opposed to van rompuy-style pure mediator . 
  that 's not to say that what van rompuy did was wrong , cause it was very needed and wanted back in a day , but the active presidency of tusk is a good way of building fundamentals towards future federalisation ( which is something i 'd like to see ) . 
  the european council i 'd want to see is one where each government leader represents interests on his own nation and a president looking above it , for the interest of the entire union - and that 's what tusk seems to be trying to do . 
   tusk 's declaration of an unapologetically political , if not necessarily national , agenda for his office has proved divisive in brussels . 
  funny enough - in poland he is accused of not pushing polish agenda ( or as some newspapers call it `` representing polish interests '' ) . 
  imho these accusations of tusk trying to push polish interests are unfair - he has been trying to make eu secure its external borders because he thinks it 's the best thing to do , not because it 's some polish agenda . 
   drafted , it needed consent of the heads of states to be implemented . 
  it was agreed by interior ministers , then ratified by eu leaders . 
  in either case : it was democratic , unless you do n't find your prime minister and minister of interior to have a democratic mandate . 
  @ 1 - i know nothing of romanian internal politics and its attempts of getting into schengen , but afaik currently schengen members agreed not to expand zone any further , especially during the migrant crisis , so i find it highly unlikely that germany is the only one behind this particular refusal . 
  what we lack is understanding of eu democracy among public . 
  '' * powerful countries ( germany , france ) shift their weight around to impose their will * '' - germany and france can not do a thing without support from other members . 
  the only reason why they are leaders in the eu is because most of the other countries agree with what they are saying and find it comfortable to have germany and france to blame if their proposals would fail , so these two are talking in the name of many . 
  '' * this , is dictatorship * '' - you have no clue what is dictatorship if you are saying that . 
  hopefully you 'll never get to live under one . 
  '' * i will continue to do so for the foreseeable future and i strongly encourage you to do the same * '' - i see no reason to , and i gladly support european products , cause in many cases the only alternatives come from china . 
  i 'd much rather have my money stay here than go feed country ruled by the communist party of china that hardly cares about human rights . 
  '' * in the long term , if nothing changes in democratic terms * '' - not much will change in a foreseeable future , as we 're going through few quite difficult situations in the eu ( euro and migrant crisis , uk referendum ) , what creates a very strong atmosphere against any new treaty . 
  majority of the eu countries are opposed of any significant changes to the way eu works , afaik that includes your own country . 
  @ 5 '' * the immigrants / refugees the eu ( merkel ) will impose on romania * '' - you have some extremely strong anti-german bias combined with little knowledge on how the eu works . 
  fyi : these migrants were * imposed * by ** every country in the eu with exception of 4 ** . 
  ( [ link ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34329825 ) ) '' * since as westerners you will never agree to fiscal redistribution * '' - in the 2013 eu spend $ 5.561 billion in romania , so your complain is rather pushy . 
  @ 6 '' * make no mistake , the only thing holding together the social fabric ... * '' - i would say that it 's much more than that , but ... still though : neither of the things you are talking about is going to be changed by the eu quotas on migrants . 
  also keep in mind that it 's highly unlikely all of them would stay in romania for long . 
  '' * merkels desperate and pathetic pivot to turkey * '' - merkel had little to deal with that , it was a collective agreement of the eu member states after the european council meeting . 
  and now you call it '' * pathetic pivot * '' , but i seen people on this very reddit arguing for exactly that solution to be implemented - keeping the migrants in turkey instead of letting them into europe , providing them with money for refugees , and so on . 
  i find it amazingly ironic that when people here on reddit proposed that solution - it was upvoted like the best thing ever . 
  now that eu implemented it - suddenly people think it 's the worst thing ever . 
  oh , and eu wo n't `` forcefully redistribute '' anyone . 
  current agreement is that you can refuse taking them ( in exchange you 'll have to pay 0.002 % gdp to support other countries financially if you do n't want to do this directly ) . 
  but afaik your government agreed instead to voluntarily take the refugees in after loosing the voting . 
  @ 8 '' * one could fucking rebuild syria from the ground up with that amount of money . 
  * '' - no , one could not . 
  and fyi : costs vary a lot from country to country . 
  @ 9 '' * why do western socialists and a considerable % of the population believe it is possible to help these regions by massive emigration ? 
  * '' - that 's something worth a separate topic to discuss . 
  if you really want to explore it - i 'd encourage you to just go and ask here , on / r/europe . 
  sure , you wo n't get an accurate answer , cause reddit population is very different from general public , but it will give you some ideas on a reasoning behind it . 
  i seen few topics around here asking somewhat similar questions , so you might try doing some search beforehad , perhaps you 'd find the answer you 'll looking for ( but i 'm quite sure it might not be the answer you want to hear , nor the one that has most upvotes ( reddit somehow tend to think it 's all about * guilt * , which is not accurate ) ) . 
  @ 10 '' * make no mistake , if we bring in tens of millions of people * '' - but we wo n't , so there 's nothing much to discuss , really . 
  not even turkey or jordan come close to these numbers and they have by far more migrants than europe does , and eu will . 
  besides , face it : migrants have next to no interest in living in romania , so you are perfectly * safe * from them in your transylvania . 
  '' * vote for politicians who will work with v4 * '' - buahaha , i chuckled on that one . 
  v4 is meaningless . 
  it was meaningless before conflict in ukraine , but after that - it should be more than clear that v4 is one parody of a group . 
  '' * because we need to counter-balance * '' - then make your politicians build that counter-balance , cause most of the eastern and central european countries have next to no desire for creating anything of that sorts . 
  even on a quotas only hungary , romania , czech republic , and slovakia voted against - everyone else supported the programme . 
  you know what i see in your post ? 
  [ fear , uncertainty and doubt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt ) . 
  along with [ hating ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hater_%28internet%29 ) . 
  not much more than that . 
  but to be fair - mass media are playing along very similar lines ( as some of the links you provided show ) , so i 'm not terribly surprised . 
   the relocation decision was made by the council , no , it was n't . 
  it was made by the [ ministers of interior ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34329825 ) . 
   voted on by people he did n't and could n't vote on . 
  voted on by interior ministers of individual countries . 
  seems like your problem is with the way your national minister of interior is selected , not the eu democracy as such . 
  [ comet landing ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/space_science/rosetta/science_on_the_surface_of_a_comet ) is the most famous achievement from the recent stuff . 
  from some old things - they were the only space agency to have balls to send a [ probe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giotto_%28spacecraft%29 ) through the tail of comet halley bringing [ unique ] ( http://sci.esa.int/giotto/14610-giotto-encounters-comet-halley/?fareaid=15 ) photographs from the encounter . 
  they also have a very extensive programme of earth studies ( including the network of [ sentinel satellites ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/observing_the_earth/copernicus/overview4 ) currently being deployed with an open data policy ) and various space observatories ( between many [ gaia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaia_%28spacecraft%29 ) currently building unprecedented , enormous 3d map of astronomical objects , but they also cooperated with nasa on much more famous hubble and james webb ) . 
  but you are on / r/europe , not / r/murica ... 
   i wish nasa , esa , jsa , cnsa , canadian space agency , and the russian space agency would all work together good luck convincing us government to work with china on a space exploration  would all work together for a mars mission . 
  well , esa seems to be set for working with everyone on a leo and eventually : moon exploration . 
  esa set itself up in a great location for the space politics - it 's sort of a mediator between different parties , and one agency that cooperates with everyone openly , and without any limits . 
  that 's the advantage of growing up as a fully civilian space agency , as opposite to others that are either indirectly controlled or deeply affected by military . 
   how many animals must die on that length before other animals learn not to go there ? 
  not many . 
  so far it 's mostly individual , separated cases , not a mass-murder of any sorts . 
  first months are always the worst , and we 're past that already . 
   i think not being able to migrate might have a nasty impact on the population ? 
  not really . 
  it 's an areas south of hungary we 're talking about , not siberian taiga . 
  it will have an impact , but species wo n't be in any danger of extinction . 
   it 's a good way to wipe out whole species :( no , it 's not . 
  animals will learn to avoid territories where they die . 
  deers are not lemmings . 
   but a single snare vs. a whole border covered in snare it 's rarely a single snare . 
  and snares humans build on purpose can be much more cruel than what you see here . 
  ( source : my close family member is a forest guard and a hunter ), 
  in 2014 it was 5 355 pln per square meter , comparing to 3 980 pln average monthly wage ( 1 680 pln minimal wage ) . 
  100 % agreed . 
  in theory it can , in practice it did not . 
  animals do n't really know what barbed wire is , humans do . 
  in effect it 's not much different than snares humans used ( and in some parts of europe still do use ) over a centuries - forest service rarely publishes photos like that , but they do encounter equally if not more massacred animals in an amateur traps people make . 
  some do it for food , most do it for * fun * , * sport * , sheer cruelty . 
   everyone likes them . 
  ... that would make a better average than in most of europe . 
  i know plenty of people who do n't like dogs . 
  heck : i know few people who do n't like any pets at all .
