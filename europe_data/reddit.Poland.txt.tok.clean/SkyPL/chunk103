  i vote for a mandatory paintball guns mounted on the crossings to shoot people that do that . 
   maybe they do n't know what f. . . indicators are for they surely have no slightest clue . 
  from my visits in uk more than often i felt like i 'm the only idiot on the road that 's actually using them ... 
  but i still feel safer on a british roads than polish . 
  to begin with - people tend to use breaks in a more reasonable way . 
  god damn it / poland, 
  of course . 
  most of them are , when looking outside of the anglosphere . 
  interesting . 
  all of the good universities are in western or northern europe , with 1 popping in from south and east . 
  nothing from central or south-eastern . 
  if dug out this train will be a very important find , regardless if it 's full of gold or empty . 
  from early georadar scans it seems that it 's a complete armored train from ww2 - not even one was preserved in any museum to date . 
  additionally it seems to include a few complete armored vehicles ( including tanks and tank destroyers ) onboard - again : with immerse historical value . 
  a possibility of finding additional equipment like weapons , ammunition , highly unlikely ( probably rotten down ) but still possible : documents , could really open a new chapter in our insight into the ww2 . 
  finally ps . 
  imho that 's one of the things that eu should take care of and unify across the entire eu , cause the current state of things is way too dangerous for my liking . 
  weird . 
  in 2013 lithuania was spending 0.8 % , in 2015 they 'll spend 1.11 % and their current target is to reach 2 % by 2020 ( sources : [ 1 ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/03/us-lithuania-defence-iduskbn0mu12720150403/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w5_show?p_r=4445&amp;p_d=151726&amp;p_k=1 ) ), 
  oh , i get what you mean . 
  good point . 
  population did not vote . 
  the representatives of these 7.7 % voted * against * , representatives of vast majority of population voted * for * . 
   is extremely stupid or extremely manipulative . 
  or just extremely imprecise . 
  no reason to automatically assume stupidity or ill will . 
  that 's not how it works either . 
  representatives of the countries voted , decision was made based on that , and vast majority of countries voted * for * . 
  there was no ' * arbitrary decision from the eu * ' . 
   second , did these people present themselves without delay to the authorities ? 
  if they are doing anything without delay - it 's running away from the authorities . 
   how would a v4 military fare ? 
  it 'd be a bit more powerful and less coherent version of polish army . 
  other v4 countries got relatively minor armies - even looking by % gdp it 's : hungary - 0.9 % , czech republic - 1.0 % and slovak republic - 1.0 % . 
  compare that to poland with 2.2 % ( [ source , 2015 estimate ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_120866.htm ) ) . 
  but v4 army would n't make much sense anyway - who they 'd be able to stand against ? 
  not russians , that 's for sure , cause orban is more pro-russian than any polish post-communist party . 
  czechs and slovaks meanwhile would prefer to ignore everything and everyone . 
  v4 is an illusion with no actual will to do anything coherent . 
  should have moved to latvia instead of stealing . 
   i would add psl but i think they never were in opposition  for those curious : since regaining democracy in 1989 , psl was in government coalition during years : 1991-1997 , 2001-2004 , 2007 onwards . 
  every time with a different party . 
  they 're very ... persistent . 
   he too spoke of `` hypocrisy '' , but he aimed at eu members such as france and spain , which have anti-migrant fences , but which criticise hungary 's razor-wire barrier . 
  oh yea , i found that especially amusing . 
  either support fences or do n't - a rational arguments can be put out for both sides - but having fences yourself and at the same time bashing hungary for that is laughable . 
   waaaaaaay less messy not really ...  maybe go get some inspiration there , mods ? 
  from a sub that 's 8 times smaller ? 
  yea ... we 're long past that point . 
  you never voted to be in a purely economic union . 
  [ you voted for a membership in european economic community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 ) which already was a partial political union that established several things that brits apparently do n't like any more , including a guaranteed [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/treaty_establishing_the_european_economic_community#title_iii_.e2.80.94_the_free_movement_of_persons.2c_services_and_capital ) . 
  hahaha , the most positive subreddit about it is / r/anarchism ... hahahahahahaha, 
  actually , [ yes , you do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato ), 
  oh , stop complaining already / poland, 
  well , the current doctrine is that we 'd be first to react . 
  so as much as in the end we all will rely on [ america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihnugaaea4m0 ) , polish army will be there to provide support early on , to let the ball rolling and start up nato defenses . 
  and to be fair - if poles meet in person with hungarians , * lengyel , magyar -- k\u00e9t j\u00f3 bar\u00e1t * always seems to make people smile , 
  an act of democracy would be to follow the constitutional path . 
  if we 'd ignore all the rules in the name of abstract impressions of what democracy is and what it is n't - in a worst case we 'd end up in anarchy , in a best one : in a rule of mob . 
  constitution is not blocking anyone from conducting such referendum , but it has a specific order in which and how it should be done . 
  otherwise it 's not much better than what russians did in ukraine . 
  yep , and in this case : democratic order of doing things was infringed . 
  1 square meter garden ? 
  what he is supposed to do with that ? 
  plant a radish ? 
  democratic order is set by a constitution , constitution that , as far as i 'm aware , is forcing such referenda to be made on the territory of entire spain . 
  someone is wiping his ass with a constitutional order - he gets punished for that . 
  imho it looks amazing inside and outside . 
  one of the best-looking buildings in warsaw . 
  well , there 's that too , though apparently people think that noone will be there to pay for their retirement , so i provided more ... fun solution , 
  your sarcasm detector is broken today , 
  certainly amusing that he first complains about the opponents of mass migration into europe using a [ black swan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_swan_theory ) - type arguments , and then he does exactly the same . 
  catering to american audience with american humor, 
   the age pyramid still looks better than most european countries . 
  then governments should act to change it in your country instead of pulling migrants in . 
   this does n't happen in europe . 
  in some countries it does n't . 
  in other it does . 
  europe is a very diverse continent , despite of what some media try to imply . 
  musk kissed it himself, 
   `` many studies show does not happen '' . 
  the only studies i 've seen show that middle eastern and african immigration he is doing the same thing [ as last ~ ~ heavily ~ ~ mildly up-voted video did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lb43j/the_european_refugee_crisis_and_syria_explained/ ) - drawing conclusions on the european immigrants based on a statistics of latino american immigrants in the us . 
  people elected him to the european parliament , we might not like it , but in fact : he ** is ** representing poland . 
  or ... you know ... you could focus on encouraging your population to have more children instead of importing people from other countries . 
  [ yhym ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/tin_foil_hat_2.png ), 
  let 's not forget my favourite excuse : it 's not islam , it 's poverty . 
  we can not blame islam , because islam is diverse and christianity is even worse - look : crusades and inquisition . 
  not sure if you can find over 700 scientists with enough patience to withstand politicians over the span of few years , though i would certainly like to see similar initiative on a national level , given huge disregard of science or ... well , even logic that too many members of national parliament display all too frequently . 
  yes , and they do n't walk with falanga but rather polish flag . 
  well , electing president that says things that either undermine nato or partially dismantle it certainly does help in repeating the cause of the precious growth ... 
  well , he lost a popular vote , but won thanks to electoral college . 
  most of americans do not see it that way and strongly disagree . 
  it 's still very much work in progress but last 2 months gave signs for a positive conclusion and in deed - succesful formation of the eu army , even if without some countries who try to obstruct it ( \\* cough \\* poland ) . 
  held it last year , and this year will come close ( for large satellites they are pushing as many launches as the industrial base can output rockets , so there 's not much they can do to sign even more contracts for launches within next 2 years , new contracts go beyond that ) . 
  random fun fact : arianespace was the first commercial launch provider , and for a while they held 100 % of market . 
  technically it 's an illiberal democracy - a. . . very specific approach to democracy . 
  there 's more to it than just a tyrrany of majority . 
  all rockets have components imported from various different locations , but ariane family is quite unique in sourcing large sections of rocket from various different countries . 
  current ariane 5 , which is even more complex , leads the market by revenues and is one of a few launch vehicles to enjoy 100 % success rate within last 10 years . 
  perfect for intelligence purposes .
