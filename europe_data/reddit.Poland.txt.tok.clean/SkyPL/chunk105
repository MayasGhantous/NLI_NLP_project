   what our government was trying to achieve . 
  appease the voters . 
  you have n't been paying much attention to the right-wing press , have you ? 
  they hated caracal and tiger since the first critical opinions from pis appeared . 
  add to this the connection between nszz solidarno\u015b\u0107 and president duda , their strong and loud support during presidential campaign , connections of macierewicz with sikorsky and pratt & whitney , all the bs about western betrayal , and the entire campaign of lies built up around caracals to the point where even general public started believing that it was the worst choice ( which was met with next-to-no response trying to avoid harm to the relations with aw and lm ) . 
   it was done deal not really . 
  contract was n't signed yet , negotiations were ongoing and - while extremely rare - it was possible to abandon it at this stage . 
   or perhaps they want to go back to being usa 's lapdog and buy from them ? 
  my bet is that they 'll buy helis from both : mielec and \u015awidnik . 
  contract to satisfy us desires was the one for patriots , where we picked inferior product for the sake of appeasing usa . 
  here us interests are secondary at best . 
  domestic policy became the top priority . 
   this is such a bad move diplomatically . 
  it was bad * diplomatically * , it was bad from * quality * point of view ( both s70i ( even the armed variant lm recently proposed ) and aw149 are inferior to h225m purely based on specification ) , it was bad from * financial * point of view ( all 3 helis were in comparable price , armed s70i will likely be more expensive than previously proposed and priced unarmed variant , and both : s70i and aw149 were inferior helis as already pointed out ) , bad for the * economy * ( in a long term poland could become one of the pillars in airbus manufacturing chain , world 's second-largest aerospace company , not to mention benefits from linked turbomeca offer for manufacturing makila 2 engines in poland ) , and it was bad for * military * ( h225m was their preferred option even before other factors came in , and that 's not to mention upcoming delays in procurement which very likely will lead to stranding our military without a helicopter in this class once mi 's end their life span ) . 
  yes , so did i. 
  if something works and people think it works thanks to someone else - it makes sense to point out that it 's not the case . 
  using eu as a scapegoat while omitting positives it brings is a huge problem they try to address . 
  be grateful that you never lived in a state that actually * is * doing propaganda . 
  cause from your clueless post it 's clear that you never had to go through that . 
  refering to the rest as the `` continent '' i 'm fine with . 
  it 's when brits call it `` europe '' that feels off . 
  uk is on the same continental plate , no matter what linguistic acrobatics you attempt . 
  somewhat misleading title : there 's been no new `` swelling '' of the cost estimates . 
  -40 is the kind of temperature where if you 'll throw the boiling water up in the air - snow will fall back down . 
  nuclear as in ... the nuclear bunkers ? 
  to survive nuclear blasts ? 
  what happen to faith ? 
  i do n't know . 
  they were campaigning for that just like everyone else did , and `` dziewuchy dziewuchom '' was n't * the * organizer behind it - * multiple * different groups , random people on social media , and political parties themselves were . 
  as far as i see it - guy has waaay oversimplified point of view on the whole matter . 
  [ po ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_platform ) is a former government party , one that suffered a big low during elections last year after 8 years of being a major party in a coalition government . 
  in eu parliament they 're epp . 
  [ . n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_\\ ( political_party \\ ) ) is a new liberal centrist party that was funded last year and became a 4th party in the parliament . 
  in eu parliament they joined alde , though do n't have any meps . 
  ( see wikipedia links for more ), 
  esa was allowed to make some evaluations , so hopefully they spotted all the issues ... hopefully ... russians recently suffer from a huge quality control issues ( even briz-m that pushed exomars on its interplanetary trajectory suffered from what seemed like an explosion right after the separation of spacecraft , through russians deny that anything like that happened ) so there 's certainly an unusual amount of tension for this landing , just as it was for the launch itself . 
  esa could built lander on its own , but there 's just not enough funding . 
  still though - even if schiaparelli fails - the core of the mission is orbiter itself , the largest spacecraft ever sent to mars will science the fuck out of it , 
  current status quo has a very , very strong support . 
  i doubt there will be any large attempt to push for further liberalization , and as long as the current government is in power : it will never pass through the parliament ( read also my previous comment ), 
  there were 2 projects proposed by citizens : one to make law more liberal , one to make law more conservative . 
  it was pis and kukiz '15 who voted liberal one out in a first reading and supported conservative . 
  no matter how you want to spin it - pis does bear the responsibility for this circus . 
  i 'm pretty sure acta took at least a week , this one was almost day-to-day , with night time sejm sessions . 
  there 's been some token help from most countries - but sadly just that : token . 
  european border and coast guard will have more capability than all these tokens combined . 
  arianespace is mostly private with very varied ownership . 
  ariane itself is more european rocket than it is specifically french . 
  lol . 
  poland does n't have a single us military base , regardless of how much we 'd want to have it . 
  we 've got some hardware storage and that would be about it at the moment . 
  [ cbos , march 2016 ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/pl/publikacje/news/2016/13/dane/1320161.jpg ) : should abortion be legal in a case of : threatened mother 's life , threatened mother 's health , pregnancy as a result of rape or incest , known that child will be disabled , mother is in difficult material situation ( poverty ) , mother is in difficult personal situation , mother simply does n't want to have a child . 
  [ ibris , june 2016 ] ( http://www.rp.pl/spoleczenstwo/160609815-ibris-polacy-chca-calkowitego-zakazu-aborcji.html#ap-1 ) : do you support total ban of abortion with exception of situation where mother 's life is threatened : yes : 57,9 % women , 59,5 % men . 
  i wonder how that even happens . 
  even turkey is in , haha, 
  fighting tax evasion was his election promise since he was picked as an epp candidate for the president of the european commission . 
  haha , sealand applying for eu membership - now that would be something, 
  stra\u00dfbourg parliment building should be used for university , or something like that . 
  no pan-eu military command should be placed in any of the largest countries . 
   during storm season [ last year ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/yvuwyxnm19jtqrjqiuowo94iorgn1fnhz2zewzp1teo.jpg?w=838&amp;s=18a78f26a67130d7f7a937e0c252fe24 ) they had no problem with that ... 
  good luck explaining that to reddit . 
  i seen several attempts - none of them successful . 
  there 's also no point pretending that there 's some malice intend in this particular interview . 
  poe 's law does n't have anything to deal with being * enraged * , just that it 's difficult to distinguish sincerity with parody ( specifically online , though this guy moved it outside of the net ), 
  he 's an incarnation of poe 's law . 
  it got nothing to deal with lack of sense of humour . 
  i watched him live , talking some shit about iphones . 
  had no idea who the guy is , thought he 's some special kind of retard that i never heard about . 
  they should have some warning before he starts talking , or something ... lol . 
  poe 's law in action . 
  it 's a similar model to the [ state of the union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_the_union ) in usa . 
  which is precisely why they should get in and lead it . 
  had a [ different longbow ] ( http://images04.military.com/media/equipment/military-aircraft/ah-64-apache-longbow/ah-64-apache-longbow_002.jpg ) in mind ... 
  [ with regards from rosetta project scientist ] ( https://vine.co/v/5zemtzziumv ) . 
  i 'm glad that they 're doing it . 
  definitely one of the positives of the lisbon treaty . 
  well , that went quick . 
  i see even junker himself intervened , nice . 
   europe, 
  fyi : it 's easier to corrupt money from the national budget than eu . 
  majority of eu finances are checked on both : national and eu level making them much more difficult to be defrauded than whatever money your country puts on a table . 
  he is a mep and he is a british politician . 
  analoada ? 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  if i recall it right - someone calculated that we 'd have to turn the area of an entire warsaw into a single solar panel in order to power the country . 
  money is n't that much of a problem - we can afford it , especially given rather decent financial terms proposed . 
  but a lack of strong political support and competent , determined people to lead the project is . 
  i still insist that we all should start calling pineapple ananas in english - eventually if enough people would use it - it 'd become an acceptable english word and we 'd solve this bs . 
  they could always invest in eastern poland ... 
  that 's not relevant . 
  we 're talking here about police / british military , not homicide rates . 
  according to [ this site ] ( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/tables/organisation_summary.html ) there 's been estimated 363 deaths from the hands of british security in a period of 32 years ( 1969-2001 ) , which is still a low number in a grand scheme of things , though certainly very high per ni citizen ( population in '90s was bit over 1.6 m , so doing some very lazy maths : avg . 
  11.3 causality/year = 0.14 mln citizens per causality , much worse than in us , even more so considering that ni population was lower during the most heated period of the conflict ) . 
  vast majority of causalities were from republican and loyalist paramilitary groups ( in 2:1 proportion ) . 
   personally , i think this is a bad move and that the problem they seek to address with it can be solved differently , for instance by requiring a physical address ( residence ) in the country where you get the contract in for example . 
  ( edit : maybe not so good , see below ) that does n't * solve * anything for a top-up phones . 
  east stratcom also has a [ twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/euvsdisinfo ) with highlights of their weekly newsletter which you can subscribe to [ here ] ( https://europa.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cd23226ada1699a77000eb60b&amp;id=b3e14c337c ) for english version and [ here ] ( https://europa.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cd23226ada1699a77000eb60b&amp;id=318900f5c5 ) for russian . 
  so no , it 's not just a pdf . 
  they actually do a solid work , being the only organization i know about that 's regularly monitoring and debunks russian propaganda . 
  their huge problem though is the accessibility of data .
