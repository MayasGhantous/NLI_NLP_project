  actually you could argue that it 's dramatically higher or absurdly lower , depending on which year you are looking at , simply because the sample size is so miniscule , that if you 'd say `` noone gets killed by police in uk '' you would n't be far off the mark . 
  apparently since 1920 there 's been so many killings of people by police ( regardless of skin color ) that [ you can list every single one of them on a single a-4 page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_united_kingdom ) , and many of them even have their own wikipedia articles ( o_o ) . 
  in 2015 there 's been 3 killings , compared to [ 1,186 ] ( https://thinkprogress.org/heres-how-many-people-police-killed-in-2015-e9e78c890966#.4ybhfzifx ) in us . 
  in the entire year uk got a day worth of us killings . 
  or 1 killing per 21.4 mln citizens in uk vs 1 killing per 0.269 mln citizens in us . 
  so ... sorry , but those guys are wasting their time in uk . 
  it 's actually a `` news '' from may , so ... it came before net neutrality . 
  that 's one of the plans . 
  to be more specific - 1.65 gw powerplant that 's suppose to begin operations in 2031 ( delayed from 2029 by the new government ) . 
  that said though - they still have n't decided on the localisation , even though list was narrowed down to 2 proposals ( \u017barnowiec and lubiatowo-kopalino ) . 
  other than that ... well ... more coal \\* eyerolls \\* . 
  then work for a smaller company . 
  it is more than just corporations . 
  it 's china , they do n't need to get it certified all over the world , they can use it purely domestically and/or for military purposes , no need to sell it abroad ( if you are not aware - certification is required only in you sell planes on a certain market , you can still fly there ) . 
  that 's other than the fact that it 's a pure cargo craft , so i doubt they 'd have a huge problems with certification , these undergo far less strict requirements than airliners do . 
  came in to see how our special-care patient [ jkm ] ( http://www.thinkingabout.eu/topics/janusz%20korwin-mikke ) is doing - scrolled through a grandiose list of 7 entries over 3 years , was no disappoint . 
  mortars are using explosive projectiles , which are `` destructive devices '' . 
  it 's a military plate , these are not available in any public register . 
  but yes - it should have all the proper paper work done . 
  afaik in us it 's legal to own main battle tanks as long as you have a license for destructive devices . 
  on another fun note - you can own front-loaded artillery without a license , as long as it 's using solid projectiles . 
  ( usual variations between states might apply ), 
  i linked it for images more than anything else ... 
  [ ekhm ] ( http://www.armslist.com/posts/4616205/oklahoma-city-oklahoma-nfa-firearms-for-sale--fully-operational-main-battle-tank-with-120mm-live-cannon )  the main gun is registered as a destructive device with the atf and comes with 10 projectiles . 
  more projectiles are available . 
  just to clarify - register plates are painted on armor , but they do look like a proper plates . 
  to give an example - polish [ leopard 2a5 with a register plate ] ( http://www.smartage.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/9-7.jpg ) painted on a lower glacis . 
  you forgot about [ trains ] ( https://warisboring.com/giant-missiles-on-secret-war-trains-cool-concept-tough-to-pull-off-ccef941cb724 ) . 
  and here 's a post covering the matter of so-called merkel 's `` invitation '' of refugees : [ chancellor merkels ` invitation ' in the refugee crisis ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?st=isipz7h2&amp;sh=016630cb ), 
  slovenia with population of 2 million had more submittions than poland with population of 38.5 mln ... just saying ... 
  funny enough r pcmasterrace brought by far more traffic than r europe . 
  so ... good job pc gamers ? 
  of course , nowhere near they are now , but still . 
  they not only can do , but they actually * do * a lot of good stuff . 
  it 's extremely unlikely that these companies would leave , given the fact that ireland still have the lowest corporate taxes in europe , even if taxed fairly . 
  google was borderline meaningless in china . 
  losses were minimal , perhaps they even saved money , given the resources they spent on complying with chinese censorship like a little dogs . 
  just to clarify : this ruling covers only a period between 2003 and 2014 . 
  commission does not have a power to recover money from the illegal state aid beyond 10 years from the initial inquiry ( 2013 ) . 
  which means that still a large portion of money will be lost to irish taxpayers . 
   ireland 's tax system is not only illegal nothing like that happened . 
   the eu competition ministry is not a legal body european commission has an authority to do that . 
   this is not an ex post facto law they broke eu state aid rules which were first implemented in 1957 , so by the time ireland joined eec in 1972 - they were already obligated to follow them . 
  none the less - ruling covers only the period between 2003 and 2014 . 
   just seems like it 's going to get tossed on appeal pretty quickly . 
  of course , even if all-knowing aliens would descend on ufos from space and hover over this paper that established * apple sales international * so-called `` head office '' without employees or premises , announcing hereby that apple is guilty - they 'd still run as soon as possible to appeal . 
  [ here 's an official press release ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-2923_en.htm ) that might clarify the extent of bs they did for you . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:main_players_for_international_trade,_2014_\\ ( billion_eur \\ ) _ yb16.png ) is a good graph illustrating how it shapes in an actual numbers , but that 's only eu-28 , not an eea ( switzerland and norway also made it to the list , including them , eea as a whole , is a number 1 in both : imports and exports ) . 
   from the uk and now the eu . 
  no , they 've been attracting companies from the eu for years , if not decades . 
  there 's no `` and now '' in it . 
  this makes no sense . 
  if they want to trade in eu , they have to have an office * in the eu * , so post-brexit uk is * not an option * . 
  it 's not a loophole , it 's some nonsense you just made up moment ago . 
  just like google is , yet - they get far more criticism , especially on reddit . 
  interesting that we do n't have anyone here strongly defending apple . 
  somehow every time google gets punished - we have at least one guy claiming that google * did no wrong * and ec is * the evil * . 
  i like how the first place this news was posted on reddit is / r/yurop, 
   they want an eu with more external powers at the same time they viciously oppose common defense polity and foreign relations . 
  in fact they even opposed european border guard . 
  sorry , but what they are doing * is * contradictory . 
  we already tried that , did n't end well, 
  united earth ... man can dream ... 
  hm ... so germans use belugas to deliver airplane parts and sperm whales to deliver car parts ? 
  do n't worry , most of the people here are very aware what is the reason for sanctions and do support them . 
  does n't change the fact that it 's a very hard time to be an orchard owner, 
  well , i would n't exactly call him a hero , but this list certainly casts him in a very positive light , even though the headline clearly tries to imply malice . 
  i 'm not in warsaw , but appreciated having conferences organized in places that are easily accessible and somewhere around centre of the country instead of a relatively small city in south-eastern outskirts . 
  does n't have to be warsaw specifically though it makes sense given the fact that space-related companies are far more prevalent in there than rzesz\u00f3w . 
  the same can not be said about big cities in central poland , or heck , even krak\u00f3w / katowice/gda \u0144sk / gdynia all of which got better communication with rest of the country . 
  it 's a citizens debate , so warsaw would be a natural choice . 
  aviation valley is not exactly a stellar location for the objectives of this series of debates . 
  even on the industrial level : if it 'd be about aviation industry - sure . 
  but in space rzesz\u00f3w has very little to offer . 
  sadly none of these are in any location i can reach at that date :( ( also : poland - rzesz\u00f3w , come on , they really went a full on with this `` invest in eastern poland '' meme ), 
  got ta love media which make this a headline . 
  lol come on reuters , you can do better than that . 
  it might be a slow news day , but not that slow . 
  [ pigs are kryptonite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quqchgqal-8 ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasa_ ( ship ), 
  i have never seen this `` plumber '' thing used outside of reddit . 
  on the other hand : `` can not into space '' is much more annoying given the fact that we 're a members of esa , got few satellites and had polish astronaut ( within interkosmos ) before most of other nations did . 
  and this * meme * is waaay too popular , i even heard it once from a manager working for an aerospace company , and it 's not like he was in a meme-target-group , age-wise ... 
  that 's a huge simplification . 
  economical divide was not nearly as important factor as it might appear for you , and it was n't anywhere near as uniform as you try to make it look , there was no clear western-eastern split on a borders , and a structure of wealth was vastly different than it is now making any such comparisons largely irrelevant . 
  what 's the key to the understanding is the eastern orthodox church vs catholic church split , and a politics of the region which were another important factor . 
  in both cases our region always was very separate from eastern europe , hence : central europe . 
  actually it existed since middle ages . 
  it 's hardly a new invention , though certainly gained in popularity in xix century . 
  having `` eastern europe '' as everything east from germany is mostly a cold war invention . 
  very unlikely . 
  but pis might be up for a surprise if they think that having a new chairman is going to radically change the rulings in their favour . 
  pretty much , yes , though general intend seems to bite it from various different angles , and because ct rules over laws , not bills , every bill passed takes a bite off tribunal , even if the most harmful laws within it are rejected on a constitutional grounds . 
  much like it is on most of the governmental buildings . 
  it 'd make sense . 
  interesting that it stimulates brain every 15 minutes . 
  one would expect it to be needed just to jump-start the brain , but once its running - continued stimulation would n't be necessary . 
  this makes me wonder what happens if for whatever reason device stops stimulating the brain - will he fall back into coma within an an hour ? 
  someone summon illuminati , please ? 
  eu did not force anyone to take refugees , eu had no borderguard nor deportation agency until last month , eu did not execute any fines on countries that did not take refugees , eu did not have a permission to defend external borders .
