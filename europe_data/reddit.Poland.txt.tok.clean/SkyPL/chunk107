  the sun 's editor 's probably expecting motherland calls size statue in kremlin for his role . 
  allows ? 
  it was a necessity . 
  it 's more of a problem for nato ... if it continues on that route it might become a real security concern . 
  uk 's membership in esa is not dependent on its membership in the eu , though british scientists and companies wo n't be taking part in post-brexit eu-funded programmes , such as galileo ( sat nav ) and copernicus ( earth observation ) . 
  which means more contracts and jobs for companies and individuals on a continent , including czechs . 
  usually a clear corelation between higher education and lower number of right-wing voters , even if they win overall , that 's been true even in [ 2015 ] ( http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,140716,title,wybory-parlamentarne-2015-tak-glosowali-polacy-wg-wyksztalcenia,wid,17933492,wiadomosc.html ) polish elections , where pis won the elections among all groups , yet they noted significant decrease in popularity as you went up the education pyramid . 
  oh , i agree . 
  just pointing out that looking at the share of population is far from ideal given the fact that for various reasons crime rates , types of crimes , and numerous other factors differ in both groups . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_lives_matter#.22all_lives_matter.22 ) got some coverage on that slogan , not perfect , but should give you some better understanding of the underlying background . 
  the assumption is that police by default thinks that white lifes matter , so the blm movement wants to bring blacks on an even ground . 
  [ crime rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_and_crime_in_the_united_states ) would be more relevant , given the fact that we are talking here about police interventions . 
  ideally you 'd compare total number of interventions with white and blacks to the number of white and blacks killed to get your '' * x as likely to be shot as white people * '' , but i ca n't be bothered to look for it . 
  it 's getting more and more extreme . 
  * no , * brexit does not mean that uk sailed away from european coast , and it does n't mean brits are going to build rockets and launch away from earth either . 
  brexit wo n't make uk go any further away from us than you would be otherwise , the rate our continental plate drifts away from north american is not affected by referendum or article 50 . 
  here 's your chance guys !, 
  quoted sentence does n't imply that they do n't realize it either . 
  they are merely pointing out a fact from the * study * , a separate one to what was said in a headline . 
  vpns push ratings in other countries , 
  i do realize it just fine . 
  that 's not the point . 
  re-read the post , only this time keeping your fingers away from caps lock . 
   in absolute numbers the united states clearly comes out on top . 
  with nearly 10 billion visits to streaming portals and over 3 billion to torrent sites , the u.s. beats all other countries . 
  also i would n't be surprised if their choice of '' * 14,000 of the largest global piracy sites * '' would be english-centric , given the fact that muso focuses on us and eu markets . 
  it 's in their direct interest to show the results you are seeing . 
  not to mention that i would much rather see a study from someone who does not directly profit from fearmongering with piracy . 
  you have no idea what would be the consequences of such action . 
  it 's unimaginable , even for most bold politicians . 
  noone will do anything like that , it 's absurd insinuation . 
  +118 ... ama with random british police officer got more upvotes . 
  emotions . 
  that 's how . 
  it 's been removed ? 
  i 'm confused ... 
  `` stealthy submarine armed with icbms sent to defend gibraltar from spanish invasion '', 
  eu with them would n't be eu , more like ... gu , global union , or something like that ... 
  i can almost hear his world view breaking apart . 
  yes and no . 
  in poland we do have races between the leaders , but at the end its party that won the elections , and on a few occasions we 've seen pms and the entire cabinets changed during the term , without any new elections . 
  meanwhile you ca n't swap us president for the other one from the same party without elections . 
  i 'm pretty sure that when randomly asked on a street - you do n't really have time or will to `` check facts '' , and for sure you do n't know all the governmental agencies . 
  in front of a camera , probably most of them were stressed out and/or thought it 's about suffering . 
  jesus would be grossly unpopular in xxi century with his views . 
  yep . 
  at this point ttip is almost dead . 
  there 's so much opposition across the citizens of the entire eu that it 'd be laughably easy for any party to earn some solid political capital by vetoing it . 
  somehow i ca n't believe that across 28 member states there wo n't be anyone to grab that low-hanging fruit . 
  and all it takes is just one state to veto it . 
  he would take it for one day , give all the money earned to orphans , and publish every paper g&s gives him on public domain . 
  next day he would put fire under g&s hq . 
  day after he would single handedly capture the whole management and put them in a jail , built with his own bare hands on a finnish swamp . 
  he would spend following three days feeding on a blood of banksters . 
  by the seventh day apfsds-t had completed the work he had been doing , so on the seventh day he stopped working on everything that he had done . 
  then apfsds-t blessed the seventh day and made it holy . 
  1991 never forget . 
  mmmm ... realizing election promises ... hopefully they wo n't go over the top with that ... 
  from what i seen - police is respected in germany comparing to what they get in poland . 
  this video is so popular precisely because of how extremely uncommon things like that are , in fact - that 's the first time i recall watching anything similar . 
  more than often it 's [ hwdp ] ( https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hwdp&amp;utm_source=search-action ) . 
  not amsterdam ? 
  maybe he actually is an * england man * , as in : his body is in a shape of england ? 
  you never know . 
    a government official said there was a `` pact with holy father john paul ii '' to protect it . 
   who said that ? 
  any context ? 
  head of the chancellery of the prime minister [ did ] ( http://wpolityce.pl/polityka/302134-beata-kempa-brzegi-przygotowane-na-sdm-mamy-zawarty-pakt-z-janem-pawlem-ii ) . 
   were also involved in official catholic movement such as official masses etc. 
  you misread . 
  they are not making an accusation that they participated in the event . 
  i 'm relatively cool with them visiting masses or various events , even speaking , but there need to be some border on how far it can go , especially during campaign . 
   sources please - both from francis and ` leaders ' . 
  as for francis - they are talking about [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36636845 ) . 
  as for `` leaders '' - i do n't recall that . 
  there was the infamous speech of pis mp paw\u0142owicz from 2013 , but she 's not a leader ... maybe someone else knows what they had in mind . 
   it 's 20 % of this ` article it 's 1 paragraph out of 8 . 
  more like 12.5 % , 
  more likely it gets an anonymous id for your phone ( as opposite to identifying you by name and surname ) . 
  i guess that 's to mitigate ddos attacks ( put caps on amount of queries per user per time ) . 
  oh , that 's just the usual * i disagree , therefore it 's wrong * . 
  in its influence on european , and recently even us , politics . 
  how is that a problem ? 
  i would say the opposite - it 's great . 
  my family lives in wroclaw , and still runs adsl with something like 4 mb/s . 
  that 's the problem with infrastructure - it 's ... spotty . 
  telecoms invest only in where it is profitable , and they tend to do it to the extreme . 
  if your house happens to be `` too far '' , you 're fucked . 
  we actually do have that in poland . 
  works ... alright , i suppose. , though there 's nothing like 60 % decrease in price . 
  more like 10 ... 
  the key figures sit in us and noone out there even considers touching them . 
   `` unlike the others , i find its smell is quite pleasant , '' he said . 
  `` it smells of life . '' oh , ok , so everyone found it stinking like a too-old-cheese , but one guy who liked it . 
  well ... that 's slightly misleading title . 
  the view probably comes from the fact that it seems to be such a big affair . 
  i will wash my hands after touching pig , dog , or every other animal living its life outside the house , simply because they collect dirt and all kinds of pathogens while running around . 
  but i do n't feel like reminding people that animal x is * impure * and i have to wash my hands . 
   it 's not like they start loosing their beard and start loosing their muslamic powers hahah , guy 's brilliant . 
  should photoshop pig noses instead [ edit ] as recommended by other redditors - dog noses would be even better ( and still funny ) .
