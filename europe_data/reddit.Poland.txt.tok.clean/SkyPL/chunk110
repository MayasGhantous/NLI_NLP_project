  early announcements are a great way to make sure people know that they do have these papers . 
  pretty sure they just do the usual - built the website and a searchable database from tons of documents in various formats . 
  this stuff takes time , whether you want it or not . 
  they would not spend # 11bn . 
  ni would be integrated into the country , so it 'd play by the same rules other regions do . 
  there would be a huge restructuration coming if ni would choose to join ireland . 
   the uk subsidizes ni to the tune of # 11bn . 
  and at the same time :  the british taxpayer is not going to continue giving us # 11bn a year indefinitely also : after reunification ireland would take it on , much like it does for its other regions . 
  we were talking about so-called swiss scenario for uk , a framework of bilateral agreements . 
  not the `` trade deals '' as such . 
  sorry for being too vague , thought it 's obvious . 
  true . 
  but the actual war was n't near that border , ukraine is a huge country ( unless you count annexation of crimea as a war , in which case - fair enough , that 's much closer ), 
   on their border technically these were n't on their border , with last one being fought roughly 700km from eu border . 
  you could fit the entire portugal in that space , with enough to spare for cyprus ... 
  nah , these are n't bad . 
  2nd , 4th , 5th are actually decent . 
  there are some [ awful ] ( https://jrokita.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ob-2.jpg ) * illdesigned monstrosities * if you really want to find them . 
   i have yet to see a wto sanctioned trade deal where one side is free to take tarriffs on the same product the counterpart isnt . 
  so there is not much to be negotiated first of all - tariffs are the easiest bit . 
  you either have them or not . 
  it 's about everything else . 
  and secondly - if it 'd be as easy as you think deals like ceta would n't take several years to negotiate , and uk would n't have to hire foreigners to negotiate their trade deals . 
   the reason the eu doesnt want in this case it 's countries themselves that do n't want to do it outside of the union . 
  which , by the way , you rightfully pointed out yourself in the previous post : '' *** they want *** * a relation , but through the eu * '' . 
  do n't change the narrative to fit your point of view from one post to another , cause that 's just silly . 
  oh , by no means i mean that . 
  but it 's only natural that elements of strategic importance are equally important in offensive war as they are in defensive . 
  please , next time link the article instead of a picture . 
  if you 're worried about paywall - copy & paste contents into the comment . 
  member states want to negotiate trade deals as a block instead of going in 1vs1 because it gives them much , much more negotiating power . 
  why do you imply that it 's evil in some way ? 
  they try to protect their own interests . 
  it 's uk that plans to walk away and stupidly thinks it will give it some privileges/advantage in negotiations , others are in no obligation to play their game . 
  politicians are * willing * to say a lot of things in order to achieve their goals . 
  for turkey it is to become a westernised , secular country with healthy democracy - if that 's achieved eu might consider getting them in , though even then it 'd be difficult given the fact that any single member state can block turkey from joining the union - with clear reservations from cyprus , for obvious reasons , and opposition towards islamic countries from central european states - i do n't see that happening , no matter if requirements would be lowered or not . 
  politicians are just making sure that this carrot on a stick is visible to turks . 
  it does not mean that they 'll be allowed to eat it any time soon . 
  your individual country might not , but for nato these are strategic locations . 
  they isolate kaliningrad and provide nato with the closest bases to moscow . 
  you still think only about uk-ireland , i think about everything outside of you two . 
  you know : the entire world that you get to see once you sail outside of your isles . 
  but ... [ it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terminology_of_the_british_isles ) a geographical term . 
   it was only used in the british empire , and it not recognised in ireland because of that . 
  hold your horses there . 
  it was n't `` only used in the british empire '' . 
  pretty sure entire worldwide [ scientific ] ( https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;q=%22british+isles%22 ) community uses this term to describe british isles . 
  maybe it 's limited to outside of ireland , though i would n't be surprised if irish scientists would use it too . 
  heck : i learnt this term on a geography lessons in school , and that 's in a country that was in a hostile political block to the british one , that never was a part of the british empire nor had anything to deal with it . 
  [ meanwhile in poland ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/naj%c5%9bwi%c4%99tsza_maryja_panna_kr%c3%b3lowa_polski ) . 
   the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland hence : uk - ni = gb . 
  uk - ni - scotland = not-great britain . 
  that 's the logic he follows . 
  you wo n't be able to use great britain as a name of your country , just like you wo n't be able to use united kingdom after northern ireland leaves ( uk is a derivative from * the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland * - no ni , not united any more , all that you 're left with is `` great britain '' , and after scotland is gone - it 's not great britain either ) . 
  i do n't know how to explain it in any more basic way , cause you clearly have a problem with understanding the message , it 's not even that you disagree , it clearly seems that you do n't even understand it . 
  so how do you call them ? 
  it 's a geographically correct term , much like ... germanic basin is , even though it includes areas beyond germany or these inhabited by former germanic tribes . 
  there wo n't be any new treaty without agreement from all member states , and until article 50 is invoked - that also includes uk . 
  we have exactly the same situation in poland . 
  district voting in senate , which does n't wield the primary power and there are reoccurring ideas of abolishing it . 
   it 's just that the uk could empower them a lot more outside the eu and make them more effectual . 
  oh , the mythical ' * everything will be better once outside of the eu * ' . 
  wish you best luck , though i do n't see how eu was an obstacle in empowering cooperatives . 
  but well - it 's all up to your political elites now . 
  if you think his video is so full of false information - feel free to make a post listing mistakes he made and telling people what is true . 
  i 'm sure many redditors would appreciate it instead of random shitposting . 
  only problem being that apparently uk does n't want the norwegian option . 
   those with the hill farms do the butterflies what the actual fuck ? 
  hahahaha, 
   if memory serves they also want to help uk farms form co-operatives once outside eu competition law . 
  that sounds weird . 
  polish farmers can form co-operatives just fine , and last time i checked - we still were n't kicked out of the union . 
  how is that suddenly a huge problem for brits ? 
  i smell someone is trying to shift his own incompetence on the eu . 
  [ edit ] just checked and according to the national cooperative council ( yes , we do have that ) currently in poland there 's 700 cooperatives of farmers with \u2248 42 000 members . 
  [ s ] ( http://www.krs.org.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30&amp;itemid=286 ) that 's only farmers - there 's additional 221 cooperatives of milk producers and 118 cooperatives of beekeeping & gardening ( weird mix , but that 's what it is ) . 
  also worth noting that parliament being a sovereign is something very rare among democracies . 
  in most democracies people are a sovereign . 
  it 's one of these weird shits that uk got , other obvious example being unelected and basically unaccountable upper house of the parliament - the house of lords . 
  he won elections . 
  his term ends in 2019 . 
  he was also a strong proponent of the unified eu foreign policy , which national leaders did not want to see . 
  morgherini on the other hand - she just does n't give a shit . 
  politicians in brussels can do very little about it . 
  it 's national media that parrot russian bs half the time , and national regulators that in most countries do next to nothing to punish bland lies . 
  you know that the world of diplomacy is not all-or-nothing ? 
  negotiating deal over south china sea by no means would mean chinese would run away from investing in europe . 
   a better solution would be of course to have smaller , more nimble units that can negotiate independently yes , let 's give up all power to china already . 
  if someone thought that ashton was too passive - mogherini is even worse . 
  someone , that would speak in the name of europe , with the approval of europe , but without playing to the dozens of conflicting tiny , meaningless interests that got more to deal with dickmeasuring than anything substantial . 
  depends how you look at it - expats are a loss to the country they left . 
  so yes - freedom of movement can be a pain . 
  his post is badly worded , but conveys the message . 
  there is no eu ban on gmos however imported gmo needs to comply with regulations . 
  in his post replace `` gmo '' with `` non-compliant gmo '' and you 'll get an accurate post . 
  perhaps so , but these days it feels shittier than ever before . 
  [ look ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/armstrongeconomics-wp/2014/05/gdp-poland-ukraine.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://i.tyzhden.ua/content/digest/tridico_gdp%20poland%20ukraine.jpg ) . 
  nothing to apologise for . 
  bj will provide entertainment for the entire eu for months to come . 
  he has n't even started yet , and it 's already amusing .
