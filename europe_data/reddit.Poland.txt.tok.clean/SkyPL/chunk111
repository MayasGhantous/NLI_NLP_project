  british foreign relations on the other hand ... well , now there wo n't be any doubts who to blame , so there 's the plus . 
  may is a clever politician , giving brexiters some responsibility so that in need she could fall back and scorch the earth . 
  thanks for your explanation . 
  i would n't guess . 
  point being : states are not some nearly-ethernal entities with centuries and centuries of existence , be all and end all . 
  they are created much like national identity is . 
  while eu is not a country and currently people in the eu do n't want it to become one - who are we to tell that eventually people wo n't identify with it much like we identify with our current nations , and tribes in northern finland identified with themselves just 3 centuries ago . 
  of course . 
  neither was finland until 19th century ( or 1907 if you want to count the year when it became a proper , independent state ) . 
  it 's one of the youngest countries in europe . 
  saudi arabia purchased 388 french leclerc tanks . 
  wait ... no ... that 's not what he means , is it ? 
  generally it is n't in the interest of a nation to disband the eu either . 
  eu is not there for the `` sake of eu '' - if you think than then you are the one grossly missing the point , not just of this conversation , but of the entire political system that exists in europe . 
  and yes , union does serve the interests of citizens , only problem is that majority of the people , yourself included , do n't really know in which ways it does , and often various national issues are blamed on eu , even if eu as such had absolutely nothing to deal with them . 
  i am much more concerned about national governments not serving the interests of people than the eu . 
  eu has rather good track record in doing what their little power they have allows them to do , on the other hand national governments decide pretty much everything while at the same time after recent elections i ended up with a bunch of incompetent idiots . 
  that 's really wild speculation . 
  the reality is that finns voted 57 % to join the union , with 71 % turnout , giving this decision a very strong democratic mandate . 
  objectively you might be right , but for some people ( eg . 
  national conservatives ) these bounds are incomparably stronger . 
  the interest of the citizens of the regions in finland should come first . 
  the finland as an organisation ought to be completely expendable , and disbanded if deemed to not be a benefit for the citizens . 
  calling others `` idiots '' or `` eu propaganda '' wo n't change the reality . 
  and the reality is that this state of uncertainty hurts both : british and eu economy , and it 's not just `` some bankers '' that are affected by it , but numerous people , from scientists , to small companies looking beyond domestic markets . 
  junckers reaction is perfectly appropriate . 
  european ... 
  good 1/3 of the posts here give me headache . 
  how difficult it is to use [ google ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=juncker+political+career ) before posting bs like '' * he was never leader of anything * '' ? 
  jesus , that anti-intellectualism is getting out of hand . 
  and it 's not like you are etching these words in a stone on a desert - you are using internet , answers to basics like that are seconds away . 
  you want to see rocket launch ? 
  read further down :  industrial output during the year rose by a record ** 97.8 ** per cent . 
  yep . 
  the scale of shifts is unprecedented , with some of the most notable journalists fired during last months having more than 8 years working in tvp ( 8 years was the time previous government was in power ) . 
  this whole narration of `` it happened during every previous government '' is precisely one of the government propaganda machines working hard to justify their actions even though it has little to deal with facts . 
  there . 
  nailed it . 
  and it 's not just media - same with politicians ( \\* cough \\* ukip \\* cough \\* ) . 
  i think they can hold one as soon as article 50 is invoked . 
  waiting till uk leaves the eu would be an economic suicide . 
  the major advantage of separation would be to avoid the sinking boat syndrome , hopefully luring a lot of companies from england to scotland . 
  not to mention that they wo n't have to waste time on negotiations that eventually wo n't apply to them . 
  what that damage would be ? 
  pretty much the only bad thing i can imagine is if border would be shut and england would put tariffs on everything from scotland . 
  and that 's extremely unlikely to happen . 
  in any other scenario it 'd be only beneficial for scotland , at least as far as economy goes + most of the arguments #leave camp used during their campaign ( with notable highlight being '' * this is ours independence day !, 
  * '' haha ), 
  there are no loopholes being used and noone is * forced * to work towards euro nor anyone is * forced * to take it when they are eligible . 
  it 's all up to national parliaments . 
  we are obligated to join eurozone * eventually * but there is nothing eurozone can do to * force * anything you talk about . 
  they can be in schengen and have a bilateral agreement with uk no to have a * hard border * , as you called it . 
  one does n't exclude another . 
  schengen would be applicable only to scottish citizens , not british . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  i 'm sure there 's few more languages than just polish using it , just did n't wanted to shoot in blind . 
  english used in eu parliament is already rich in a vocabulary that 's a mix of words borrowed from various languages , often making it far more consistent with the continental languages than british english is . 
  to give you an example - using `` actual '' for * current * ( as in current events ) is fairly common in eu parliment as it derives from words used in continental languages ( in polish it 's aktualny ) , while it 's not even a thing in * proper * english . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/translation/english/guidelines/documents/misused_english_terminology_eu_publications_en.pdf ) you can find more examples of words that are being used in eu parliament english but are incorrect in british or american english . 
  i would n't be surprised if eventually eu would have its own english , recognized by the international community , much like india does . 
  english evolves for the needs of people faster on the continent , with fewer native speakers , than it does in uk or us . 
  and after all that 's what it is all about - language is there to serve people in communicating with each other . 
   it 's quite rare never heard it being used in poland aside from people of making fun of czech . 
  slow news day ? 
  before ww2 poland was 2/3 roman catholic polish , now it 's like 91 % . 
  in deed , massive change . 
  only in a different direction than you think it is, 
  less visible over time ? 
  i 've been tracking eu politics since poland joined the union and have exactly opposite impression . 
  i assure you that 5 years ago you and most of the people upvoting your comment did n't even have any idea what epp is . 
  there 's been a huge increase in visibility and prominence of the eu parties during last election cycle . 
  it 's off the scale . 
  no idea how you came up with * less visible * . 
  and yet it 's exposed in most of the newsstands as if it 'd be one of the bestsellers in a country . 
  these screaming covers are clearly the way to go - even if people wo n't buy it , they 'll still see the message . 
  the more often they see content like that the more familiar and acceptable it becomes . 
  spotted a hidden german option !, 
  and yet this government managed to surge biggest protest since the fall of communism in poland . 
  quite amazing if you think about it . 
  you 're just repeating their propaganda . 
  i do n't know if you noticed , but majority of the journalists * replaced * were working for tvp much longer than last 8 years , some started their careers right after the fall of communism . 
  it 's not true that every time a new party wins they replace most of the crew , that 's something unique to this cadence of pis . 
  while the last time they won elections was also a record-breaking in terms of journalists fired - it was n't anywhere near the * purge * we 've seen this time . 
   they take our council houses - but let 's not build affordable housing . 
  to be fair - abusing the system of council housing was surprisingly common few years back . 
  but they reformed the system and now it 's fairly tight . 
  * poles - helping solve the holes in council housing system since 2004 . 
  *  they fill our hospital beds - but let 's ignore the thousands of qualified healthcare professionals from the eu who work in the nhs and the hundreds of thousands of uk emigrants and retirees enjoying free reciprocal healthcare around europe . 
  the better argument is that statistically - poles pay in far more to the nhs than they take out . 
  you have to remember that polish immigrants are usually in prime of their age - they rarely get sick , older people usually are back in poland , and poles tend to keep their kids at home and help them on their own instead of going to the doctor on every opportunity . 
  not to mention rather negative opinion about nhs among polish immigrants , even if adults do get sick - they are very likely going to go back to poland and pay a private doctor there instead of opting for nhs . 
  from top-25 news during last year : 15 imgur , 6 english-speaking , 1 nl , 1 de , 1 be + 1 i.redd.it, 
  well , there 's [ * what happened in your country this week ? 
  * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qz95o/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20160703/?st=iqdvigmq&amp;sh=74f823b4 ) , so at least we have some good stuff going on ... though i miss the times when people posted and entire paragraphs of news from their country ... 
  skip to last paragraph for tl ; dr , meanwhile , a summary of the article : a chechen family found refugee in eastern poland , got their entry doors covered in gasoline and ignited . 
  since the beginning they were a subject of racist attacks . 
  they say that when they go shopping people harass them , say stuff like '' * poland for the poles , and you , gypsies , get the fuck out to your country * '' , husband was attacked by a man with broken bottle , but managed to escape before any harm happened . 
  even their neighbours do n't let them live in peace , with one of them commenting to the newspaper : '' * it 's their fault . 
  ever since they came in there is no peace . 
  previously , there were no such comedy * '' ( pardon my rough translation of the quotes ) they report that there is no week without attacks on the family , on several occasions a groups of skins attacked them with bottles and gas , once they stole their shopping .
