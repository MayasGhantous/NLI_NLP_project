  newspaper reports that it 's just one of the series of attacks . 
  on the same day there was an identical arson attempt on another chechen family in the town . 
  also a year earlier there was another attempted arson of the sultan 's flat in a nearby village , thankfully he managed to wake up in time and extinguish fire . 
  tl ; dr : no physical harm was done , doors of 3 refugee families were put on fire , they are regularly harassed by locals . 
  also worth noting that it 's an article from 2013 , before refugee crisis started . 
   american media garbage is a never ending monolithic freight train of lies and disinformation . 
  only a single digit iq fool reads , watches and believes their propaganda . youtube , never fails . 
  of course . 
  but every time someone from germany says anything about reforming eu / r/europe whines how germans want to rule the europe , how it 's undemocratic , how they only care about benefiting themselves and screwing everyone else , with a general conclusion being that they should shut up ... 
   the plan would transform frontex `` into a border defence and deportation agency '' hehe , this should get all the upvotes from reddit . 
  i 'm surprised we 're 7 hours in an only 5 up arrows . 
  more broomsticks . 
  she ca n't reform it on her own . 
  there needs to be an eu-wide consensus for reform . 
  and from what i see - it is there , or at least - it 's building . 
  meanwhile in france ... 
  if they 'll move on with article 50 within some reasonable amount of time - i surely agree with you . 
  but if they 'll try to delay it again and again - i can see it becoming an issue . 
  it was `` a resolution on the decision to leave the eu resulting from the uk referendum '' if you want to be specific , and they already decided that said offer is null and void , regardless if uk invoked article 50 just yet or not . 
  eu parliment 's resolution on brexit specifically pointed out that it 's invalid . 
  [ here  ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=motion&amp;reference=b8-2016-0838&amp;format=xml&amp;language=en )  recalls that the settlement agreed by the heads of state or government in february 2016 stipulated that it would only enter into force if the uk decided to stay in the eu ; ** it is therefore null and void ; **, 
   i do n't recall such radical attack in recent years . 
  [ i do ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/bialystok/podpalono-domy-czeczenskich-uchodzcow-won-do-swojego-kraju/tv4y1 ) , it was an attack on chechen refugees . 
  somewhat close to the profile of an attack in this very news . 
  but it 's not owned by a single corporation . 
  if you 'll look through topics on brexit on this subreddit you should stumble upon a lost some guy posted a few times of the major british newspapers and their owners . 
  vast majority of newspapers are held by various different owners , and going by sales : it 's nowhere near the half in hands of a one man . 
  still - it is a significant share , and in some locations these tabloids are the only press that shops have available . 
  wait , wait , wait ... can they actually do it ? 
  i thought that legally they can not conduct any negotiations until article 50 is invoked . 
   below 10c\u00ba at night i do n't even bother turning the heating on if it 's +10 \u00b0 c , house keeps enough heat from daytime and just people living , breathing , to comfortably get through the night . 
  you guys really need to work on that insulation ... 
  last offer negotiated by cameron is invalid , so what rompuy said there should n't come as any surprise, 
  fucking space , that 's what !, 
  a tallest skyscraper if you include spire , yes . 
  if you do n't then [ mercury city tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercury_city_tower ) , also in russia , is the tallest building . 
  funny enough - the next tallest building in europe will also be in russia , and it will be one of the best looking sky-scrapers out there , the [ lakhta center ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lakhta_center ) . 
  yea , only krak\u00f3w is like barad-d\u00fbr of poland . 
  great way to shorten your life with all that air pollution . 
  oh , of course , but you can into space for much longer . 
  esa is not the first time hungary had something to do with space exploration . 
  he asked about esa membership and can hungary into space , so i added the missing part to your answer . 
  if it will be voted only by european parliament than it will mean that the consensus reached among the leaders of the member states was that it 's not mixed . 
  otherwise it 'd be impossible to accept it without agreement from the national parliaments . 
  final decision is not made yet , so let 's just wait and see . 
   the memberstates do n't use such a generic statements . 
  it was n't all member states . 
  good reminder for leave camp on just how long does it take to negotiate a proper trade agreement . 
  to quote conservative michael gove :  people in this country have had enough of experts, 
   since last november . 
  [ ekhm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:hungarian_astronauts ), 
  they 're actually made from cotton fibre , not paper . 
  we already did deter it . 
  polices did change . 
  it 's not open door any more . 
  immigration is nearing the levels before the crisis . 
  well , maybe leave campaigners should have thought this through before joining the leave camp ? 
  that should be like the very least one can ask you for when you campaign for something . 
  though calling it the `` independence day '' just days after the movie under the same title where london is being demolished in quite a spectacular way was much more appropriate than anyone expected it to be . 
  the whole anti-science movement is growing in strength , and it starts getting dangerous to the scientists . 
  things like brexit campaign openly saying that '' * people in this country have had enough of expert * '' only makes anti-science more and more mainstream and acceptable . 
  transitioning period will be difficult , but the end game will be more employment on the continent , which is always good . 
  on the other hand - surveys like that are good in showing people just how many aspects need to be accounted for when making a law on the subject , and how much more thought is put into them than average joe even can imagine . 
  yep , [ matching the eu-wide trend ] ( https://i.redd.it/acj2hsk4vv4x.jpg ) . 
  it did , during one of the last threads on uk lacking negotiators people even posted links to remain campaign pointing that out . 
  but an usual - media focused on nigel & boris or some obscure whoever saying some stupid shit like ww3 or nazis . 
   would be nice to not accuse every opponent first of all - he did not . 
  and secondly - even english wikipedia has a [ whole section ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_maryja#allegations_of_antisemitism ) dedicated to the allegations of anti-semitism in radio maria , with several examples provided . 
  it 's not really that hard to use google to do some additional research , if you have any doubts about positions they promote . 
  flipping u.s. department of state [ called ] ( http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/102301.pdf ) it `` blatantly anti-semitic '' . 
   you mean the compensation for taking back funds from their geothermal investment ? 
  huh ? 
  it got nothing to deal with what he posted . 
  of course . 
  that 's one of the benefits of democracy . 
  you are free not to vote , you are free not to identify with the eu , your country , your region , your city or village , you are free to support this or any other idea for future . 
  do n't break the circlejerk - it 's all cameron 's fault . 
  question was ' * how satisfied or dissatisfied are you in the way ningel farage is leader of ukip ? 
  * ' ( read the headline ) - which got nothing to deal with whether people * like * or dislike him . 
  [ ping / u/a _ wild_blue_card ], 
   i know what i 'm talking about . 
  i have zero interest in your anecdotal experiences . 
  what i care about is reality as expressed by numbers and they show one thing - infrastructure * is * improving , even despite of the fact that companies already got that inflow from big businesses . 
   he has done more than quite a bit of the parliament members . 
  he has not . 
  in fact : he is one of the least active meps in the entire parliament , 700th out of 750 ( [ source ] ( http://www.mepranking.eu/mep.php?id=124879 ) ) . 
  and that 's being generous to him by counting speeches as an activity ( the only thing he actually does to any noticeable degree ), 
   not at all . 
  you either never looked at the actual numbers , or do n't know how to interpret them . 
  [ here 's some small sample ] ( http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2016/03/global-broadband-speeds-average-5-6mbps-in-q4-2015-vs-13-9mbps-in-the-uk.html ) from quick google search . 
   germany recently decided to milk the dsl copper lines until they will fly apart . 
  first of all - germany as a state can not make such decision , it 's isps that do it . 
  and secondly - do n't catch on some random news headlines , they 're usually grossly misleading . 
  even if isps stick to dsl in one location for as long as they can - they still improve the network elsewhere , as replacements are pretty much universally faster . 
   some countries put a lot of attention to the internet infrastructure ( ee/fi/ro ) as a differentiator , others do n't . 
  and that got nothing to deal with the eu as such , it 's isps that make their investment decisions . 
  also : there 's no correlation between net neutrality laws and the average internet speed . 
   this regulation could potentially degrade the internet experience not more than it is already degraded . 
   is eu trying to resurrect ( a next generation of ) the deceased minitel why would it ? 
  it 's legal without eu doing anything .
