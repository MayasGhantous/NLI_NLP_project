  what ? 
  first time i hear that . 
  he is the guy that talked numerous times on how he would block federalists , and threatened that uk would quit the eu if it 'd federalize . 
  now you call him a federalist ? 
  he might be pro-eu , but he 's no federalist for sure . 
  jesus ... how plainly do i have to explain it ? 
  what he says is that british government can not use leave note as a lever to renegotiate it 's concessions , either from february or treaties , it * has to leave * if people say so . 
  he was n't talking about the scenario where uk chooses to stay . 
  you have to remember that there wo n't be any vote for federalization as such - it will be a process with numerous small deals done on the way . 
  so divide and conquer on a specific issues . 
  plus it 's obvious that you can take all the countries with conservative governments ( and quite surprisingly : uk is currently not doing even that , heck : new government in poland was making a big deal out of it 's alliance with uk and uk is ... apathetic ) . 
   given ** ever ** . 
  he did not say that . 
  besides - if voting to stay uk should be focusing on gathering allies to reform the eu , not looking for any more of the special treatment . 
  they already got more than enough . 
  eu needs a reform , not uk playing with `` deals '' . 
  yes , he did . 
  during the negotiations he had . 
  that 's the past . 
  and that 's not what is mentioned in a title of the article . 
  so please , spare me `` you 're the one misrepresenting here '' if you 're even less informed than whoever wrote this article . 
  he talks about what would happen * if uk referendum would end up with a leave vote * . 
  something headline conveniently is missing in order to manipulate facts . 
  context ( junker 's quote taken from bbc article on the same subject ) :  so there will be no kind of renegotiation , nor on the agreement we found in february , nor as far as any kind of treaty negotiations are concerned . 
  ** out is out . 
  ** junker is talking about a scenario where uk votes to leave . 
  even that piss-poor article says down the text ( emphasis my ) :  his statement appears to ** rule out ** any attempt by the government to ** use a leave vote as a chance to force further concessions ** from the eu while retaining some form of membership . 
  he does not mean that there wo n't be any reform if uk stays . 
  title is very much misleading . 
  oh , universe has collapsed , let 's jump down the mountain . 
  / s i 'm not saying that there 's something to be * proud * of . 
  anyway , no point discussing it further , cause you 're clearly missing the point . 
  oh , i totally agree . 
  just pointing out that the real cause is outside of the europe , and that one is a fundament that needs to be addressed for a long-lasting resolution . 
  that 's glass half empty . 
  in a glass half full - numbers of the incoming migrants went waaaaaay down , and the negative prospects of ever increasing number influx came out to be false . 
  while the immigrants are still coming - as they always have - and those that are here are still a real problem - we 're not facing 50 000 + / month any more . 
   also i do n't trust their figures one jot . 
  i posted figures are from 2 separate organizations , precisely to address complains like that . 
   too little too late sure . 
  still - it started heading in a right direction , which is something to enjoy . 
  building infrastructure to handle them wo n't help with the cause either - cause is n't in europe , the real cause is in a middle east and africa . 
  yep . 
  precisely my point - crisis did not end , but it is becoming more manageable . 
  it 's still shit though . 
  ok , facts : macedonia shutting borders for the first time happened in august 2015 , fence was built between november and early 2016 . 
  hungarian fence was built till september 2015 . 
  in case of remain vote uk should start building alliance of nations towards reforming the eu instead of asking for more exceptions . 
  part of the negotiations is making them a proper democracy . 
  it 's literally one of the conditions of joining . 
  be assured that turkey under erdo\u011fan 's illiberal democracy , would n't get a support from european parliament , and would n't fulfill the requirements . 
  negotiations do n't mean that they 'll join within next few months . 
  an important reminder in case someone forgets that having a quote is not enough - it 's worth knowing a context too . 
  thank you for posting it . 
  last few days i read here several time how we 're getting flooded with immigrants and actions of the eu bear no effect , and how we 're all doomed . 
  well , apparently it 's not a common knowledge that crisis * is * , actually , dying out . 
  actions such as the deal with turkey , calling in nato , improving frontex , etc. 
  bear the effect . 
  of course countries like macedonia and hungary building fences against eu should also be mentioned . 
  so here , i made a graph from a data of united nations high commissioner for refugees ( [ unchr ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php ) ) and [ eurostat ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_asyappctzm ) . 
  let these numbers sink in . 
  only ... they were n't actually working in unison . 
  why not 70:30 ? 
  poland had no agreement with germany similar to the secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  who else are they going to scapegoat ? 
  it 's pretty much an universal policy across the eu governments to blame shit on eu , not matter how irrelevant it is . 
  being in eu in a way is a paradise for national politics - they can escape responsibility for a surprising amount of incompetence . 
  you really need a strongly pro-eu government to avoid most of it , and even then they 'll fall the temptation every now and then . 
  if you have 1 coin , sell a banana for 2 coins - suddenly you score a 200 % growth !, 
  magic , is n't it ? 
  they both attacked poland in a coordinated manner , to the point where they made a [ joint russian-nazi parade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sko-upb6yo4 ) celebrating their victories . 
  so sorry , but that * russians did nothing wrong * revisionism is getting old . 
  yes , they did not have a formalized , official alliance , but functionally : it was an alliance , alright . 
  literally all of it is misinformation . 
  the fact that you read it and say that it 's not all misinformation says only about you . 
  there is no `` eu congress '' and uk parliament will remain in place , even if eu would federalize , it 's a matter of available powers , but it will be there and it will be democratic . 
  noone is going to divide uk into regions ( strictly speaking : uk is already divided into administrative regions , but i get the message , that 's not what they mean , still : noone is planning what they do mean ) . 
  ttip is not going to privatize anything , it 's a trade deal , trade deals do not privatize . 
  it might open a window for such privatization , but even that 's unlikely to happen ( from what i heard polish government is n't worried about that and says that it will retain control over health care system , i see no reason why british would n't ) . 
  and no , ttip is not inevitable , in fact : it 's more unlikely to happen now than i though it would be just year ago . 
  no more queen is probably the most absurd of all claims . 
  visa-free access means just that : visa-free , it does n't mean we 'll suddenly have all turks moving to the eu , it does n't mean that schengen zone will be expanded , and turkey is extremely unlikely to join eu in foreseeable future , not to mention that it 's even more unlikely to join schengen ( they move away from the eu , not towards , no matter how often politicians try to bait them , not to mention that before they join - they need to be voted in by members and uk could veto it if it 'd remain in the eu ) . 
  eu armed forces would not replace british , but it does make sense in a way [ eda ] ( http://www.eda.europa.eu/ ) does - voluntary way of decreasing costs . 
  i imagine countries like belgium or holland would be particularly interested in eu army . 
  eu will inevitably collapse in the same way uk will inevitably collapse . 
  sure , eventually every government collapses . 
  but i see no reason to worry about it in any foreseeable future . 
  eu adapted to the debt crisis , russia , and currently is in a process of working out a migrant crisis , and even though it 's badly hampered by national quarrels - this year number of immigrants started to drop , with last months being a record-low ( i still do n't get how it 's not a headline in all the media ... 
  i guess good news do n't sell well ) . 
  i guess we see two completely different eus . 
  typical brexiter logic - thinks that eu is failing , and at the same time federalization ( which would be an enormous success not even most rabit federalists see possible in any foreseeable future ) scares a shit out of him . 
   i prefer youtube where i can find common ground . 
  that 's saying a lot about you . 
  not enough germoney to build * wie\u017ca eiffla * in poland , we do with what we have ... 
  up-side-down is a symbol of distress . 
  quite appropriate , if you ask me . 
   i wonder why you guys like it so much . 
  do we ? 
  there was a joke while ago : why there was no terrorist attacks on poland ? 
  because if arabs would crash a plane into the palace of culture & science everyone would thank them for it .
