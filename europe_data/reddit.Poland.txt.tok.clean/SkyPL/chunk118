  2 bottles of sprite , a candle and mentos . 
  they [ clearly did not watch the * study * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is2vg1o7op4 ) , should have picked cherry coke instead . 
  funny how under almost every news regarding savchenko we had posts saying that she 'll never be released and whatever eu and ukraine are doing to see her released is just a laughable waste of time . 
  glad to see them proven wrong . 
  pretty sure someone already considers * moving * the border to annex wherever the next eurovision will take place . 
  it got profits back . 
  what would be great if companies would n't avoid taxation ... 
  not really . 
  china invests more in robotics and a factory automation than the entire europe combined . 
  no forest = no diseases = no problem . 
  sure , always . 
  unless they are gypsies , that is ... or if you 're not albino-white with blue eyes than just in case - stay away from football fans , cause they just might think that you are muslim migrant from syria about to rape his girlfriend ... or just to be safe - keep away from anyone bald . 
  but jokes aside - yes , there is a distinction between migrants from the eu and from middle east / africa , just keep in mind that if you might vaguely resemble anyone from any of these groups - you might not be welcomed by poles . 
  ... and think that instead of this boring article they could have posted a simple table . 
  what regime ? 
  you know what word `` regime '' even means ? 
  pretty sure you never even been in a country with regime , yet alone lived under one . 
  canadian houses are popular only among people who otherwise can not afford a `` proper '' house . 
  there 's also * deluxe * version , [ houses ] ( http://domyskibinski.pl/realizacje/127-dom-chmielniki ) made of wooden logs , much thicker and more solid than canadian , usually made by [ gorals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorals ) , or people who claim to be gorals  . 
  when plastered houses from logs look much like these from brick , so half the time you ca n't even tell , though many owners choose to expose logs , because ... well ... it looks nice . 
  still the brick housing dominates the market of newly built buildings . 
  to be fair - prices for houses in the us are rather low comparing to the eu . 
  look up [ horseshoe theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) . 
  that would be iceland , would n't it ? 
  with nearly 100 % of energy from renewables , all the time , and not just occasionally . 
  but yea ... that pessimism ... 
  i just enjoy the moment , even if it 's just a moment - shows that portugal is clearly on a right path . 
   i would like to see them out of nato , ( ... ) funnily enough , i think that our allies should actually want to be allied to us . 
  canada is a fairly active nato member , one of the more decisive , as it came out during the war in ukraine , and certainly one that wants to be allied , either be it with us or with you ( i presume - uk ? ) . 
  random fun fact - for their cooperation within nato with poland canada and us are the only two foreign armies to take part in polish armed forces day ( and knowing how allergic poles are to having foreign forces march on a parades on our soil - that 's really saying something ), 
  interesting , did n't they say at some point that they wo n't be taking sides on this issue ? 
  oh , your freedom to get cancer and let others get cancer around you . 
  much freedom . 
  there 's been plenty of mock bombs , even in my primary school back in a day , i would hope that by now mock bombs does n't really count . 
  pretty sure all they 've seen are some of his few-minute-long videos on youtube . 
  helicopter is actually french , or if you want to push it - ukrainian/russian/dutch . 
  calling it polish is such a huge stretch that it 's laughable . 
  wow , reading these comments i can say only that google circlejerk is real . 
  most did n't even bother to read any arguments ( that 's actually not all that surprising ) , just the usual bs on how google is great and not monopoly at all , evil eu is unjustly punishing them for migrants/not helping their own companies/europe sux/yadada, 
  but it 's not disruptive new tech !, 
  spacex , future , mars , electric cars !, 
  we all know it 's just germans trying to suck up before next invasion . 
  i 'm pretty sure trump 's hand is too large . 
  yea , fairly popular in poland . 
  we call it ' * dark bread * ' . 
  or as american conservatives call him : * b. hussein obama * . 
  not a discovery , but realization : norway never had it 's own astronaut , yet everyone call poland as the one that can not into space , even though it did have an astronaut . 
  i preemptively sold all my polish stocks before the elections . 
  had some doubts , but thought : better be safe than sorry . 
  i have n't thought that i 'd be so happy with my decision . 
  you should set a flair for yourself . 
  btw : i 'm amused how almost all the replies you got just confirmed your entire post . 
  poor portugal ... 
  that 's an equivalent to the current situation in the eu , where english is an official language of the eu , without precisely defining if it 's scottish english , queen 's english , irish english , or any other variety , even though some of them are standardised . 
  india just has an `` english '' as one of its official languages , so does the eu . 
  it 'd first need to be defined to become an official language/one of official languages of anything . 
  not the other way around . 
  and that process on its own will take years . 
  if it 'd need to be standardized at all ( i would guess that simply english would remain as one of the eu languages as it is now ) . 
   except for french . 
  that 's oddly specific ... 
  eu parliament is particularly rich in a vocabulary that 's a mix of words borrowed from various languages , often making it far more consistent with continental languages than british english is ( eg . 
  using `` actual '' for * current * is fairly common in most of the continental languages ( in polish it 's * aktualny * ) ) . 
  it might be weird for brits , but it was bound to happen as the language evolves for the needs of people faster on the continent , with fewer native speakers , than it does in uk or us . 
  also europeans tend to be much more affected by us english than british speakers are , at least in a countries that prefer subtitles over full dubbing ( thank hollywood ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if eventually `` eu english '' would become it 's own entity much like `` american english '' is . 
  i would presume it 'd be a mix of us and british english with numerous loanwords from other european languages . 
  both [ voting to leave the eu ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1659864/skys-brexit-map-reveals-most-pro-leave-areas ) , haha, 
  only you have to drink from the other side of the glass, 
  european integration is progressing even among the people that hate it , 
  he is not your buddy , comrade . 
  it 'd be more useful to have a percentage of average below the value in usd . 
  also what this odd color-coding is suppose to mean ? 
  other than that - they diverge from the [ cambridge economic history of modern europe ] ( https://i.imgur.com/z8l5nwy.jpg ) someone else posted [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4fgw10/soviet_occupation_caused_210_bln_damage_to/d2a2h1a?context=5 ) . 
  i see you 're getting down-voted , so [ here is a wikipedia article covering the topic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victory_in_europe_day ) . 
  your post is factually correct . 
  no reason to down-vote . 
  if something is not just european any more then there is no point calling it european . 
  i 'm fine with united federation of planets if we advance to that level , if you are so interested in semantics . 
  and i would love if we 'd keep on advancing above and beyond our puny nationalism , just like we 've advanced beyond tribes and city-states at some point of history . 
  and noone is '' * bothering * '' with values . 
  that would be a different union , not european any more . 
  and noone forbids anyone to have the same values eu does . 
  you 're right , it was n't * signed * , [ it was presented ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration/index_en.htm ) on 9 may 1950 . 
  was n't schuman declaration signed on 9th may precisely because of that ? 
  to celebrate the end of war and beginning of unity at the same day ? 
  i find it to be a great idea . 
  i liked [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwbizawuidw ) , really special considering that it took part in odessa [ around these events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_pro-russian_unrest_in_ukraine#odessa_oblast ) . 
  huh ? 
  i always use this definition when asked :  the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values are common to the member states in a society in which pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men prevail . 
  from treaty on european union ( and in before `` europe is not eu '' - today is the day of european union , on 5 may there was a day of the council of europe ) . 
  of course it did .
