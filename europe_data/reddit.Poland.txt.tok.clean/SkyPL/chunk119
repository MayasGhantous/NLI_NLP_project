  but we all know it 's not really an option for almost anyone . 
   from the fluctuations of currencies , countries in the eu can mitigate that risk with euro if they find it crucial to their stability . 
  self-sufficiency is not necessary for catching up with anyone . 
  what matters more is a trade balance , and even there - a lot depends on a structure . 
  you can have almost no raw materials and still grow a lot thanks to services and/or manufacturing . 
   had much , much bigger numbers . 
  no , they did not . 
  it was always much smaller than this one ( i did some research and ca n't find any that would go above 10 000 according to the town hall , 30 000 according to organizers . 
  no matter what you think you 've seen - that 's the numbers . ), 
  hardly hijacked - it 's their own fault that they chose not to participate in any of the protests . 
  kod was open to cooperation with anyone willing to further the cause - it 's not a political party , it 's a movement for democracy , whoever is willing to help can join in . 
  the other two did participate and in large numbers so you see what you do . 
   are demonstrations really uncommon ? 
  no , not really . 
  in warsaw there 's at least one a month ( * monthiversary * of [ the airplane crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) ) , in may and november there 's few more . 
  and remember that pretty much every larger manifestation summons counter-manifestations , no matter the cause . 
  also since the new government started doing the mess they do several ( no clue how many ) additional manifestations occurred . 
  oh , and there are always some manifestations in the election years . 
  i would say that warsaw can see it 's fair share of manifestations . 
  yes , sorry , it 's mary in english . 
  that 's 135k ( for those too lazy to do the math  ), 
  no euromaidans , do n't be ridiculous . 
  oh , yes , sure , just like police has a conflict of interest , only in the other way around . 
  it 's not . 
  town hall has a po majority while organizers were kod . 
  other parties , including po , joined it , but it 's hardly `` the same movement '' , just aligned goals . 
  in either case - there never will be an accurate number , best you can hope for are estimations , and when they vary so much - it 's difficult to tell which one is most accurate , even more so as i 'm quite sure that more numbers will pop as time goes on . 
  all i can tell is that 240 000 looks too much , while 30 000 looks way too low . 
  should list all the estimations : * 240 000 - town hall * 200 000 - city mayor * 100 000 - organizers * 30 000 - police ( updated to 45 000 ), 
  as for the third one - the full name was `` poland , have courage !, 
  mary will be victorious !, 
  '' , one of the headlines they used was :  let 's not be afraid to face the traitors of the nation on 7 may march !, 
  there 's been 2500 people on it according to the town hall , 4500 according to the police . 
  it 's seems to be the largest demonstration since the fall of communism ( [ edit ] i 'm shocked - government-controlled public tv said that it ** is ** the largest march since the fall of communism . ), 
  nothing can beat the [ gypsy vampire warloc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov3xp5zxsya ) . 
   50 % due to immigration i guess you do n't like your growth , seeing that immigration is one of the major reasons behind brexit campaign . 
  it 's even better : one tiny british boat shoots flares at a tiny spanish boat while defending enormous us submarine . 
  brace yourselves , stack of 40k separatist rebels is about to spawn !, 
  definitely something worth reminding considering how often i see people posting things like '' * eu was never meant to be political power , but only trade union . * '' . 
  i 'm also glad to see that there are still people alive who were some of the decision makers and can tell the tale . 
  yep . 
  also you can have screens playing either some videos or landscapes . 
  and besides - it 's not like claustrophobia is an issue 50 % of people have , quick google search gives me between 5 and 7 % , it 's not like buses went out of business because 5-10 % of population suffers from serve motion sickness . 
  it was a joke - he specifically avoided mentioning california to avoid looking hostile and still get the point across . 
  but as i see it does n't work with reddit , i suppose out here every reason to get mad on juncker is a valid reason . 
  flash was shot into the celling , likely with some compensation . 
  it 's a map [ from wikipedia ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:europe_regions.svg ) showing regions of europe . 
  there 's one wild card : polish government . 
  they 're in a very good relations with uk and ready to sacrifice a lot on eu stage to further their own political games . 
   do the numbers present amount of editions published ? 
  first image top to bottom : tv - number of viewers ; radio - marketshare ; web portals - number of visitors ; daily newspapers - overall sales ; weekly journals - overall sales ; second graphic is again : overall sales . 
   local press belong to springer . 
  most of local press belongs to verlagsgruppe passau which is not owned by axel springer . 
   this train of thought is too narrow good luck explaining that to the people . 
  after all these years this view has become sort of common knowledge among polish media and in politics . 
  it has some psychological background too , due to [ western betrayal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal ) they 'll always fear relying on anyone from western europe . 
  it 's not even a matter whether they are quality journalists or not , rather the whole thing [ did not happen as presented by polish media ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/621chf/polands_foreign_minister_in_a_nutshell/dfj2ls2/?st=j0up48hv&amp;sh=12bcc957 ) . 
  not to mention that apparently spiegel is owned in [ 51 % ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/621chf/polands_foreign_minister_in_a_nutshell/dfiz7bq/?st=j0upb34v&amp;sh=181a49bb ) by its own employees , what makes waszczykowski 's comment even more delusional . 
  [ this one ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/san-escobar ) ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_escobar ) ), 
  it 's not as much about fees ( though they 're certainly a factor , especially with as stressed budget as we have now ) as it is about russia cutting off gas supply specifically to poland , with little to no negative consequences to other eu member states . 
  current situation is that if russia wants to cut supplies - they have to do it for few countries at a time , cause we all use the same pipelines . 
  since ns they can start choking poland , since ns2 they 'll be able to cut poland off almost completely . 
  otherwise they would n't be poles . 
  it 's our national hobby after all , 
  it 's about [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61lqin/donald_trump_printed_out_madeup_300bn_nato/ ) , but yea , not a real invoice . 
  striking difference between slovakia and czech republic ... 
  i guess you guys split your country by who drinks what . 
  that conflict must have been unbearable in czechoslovakia . 
  i recall just passing by a tv when the second plane hit the building , my reaction was `` oh , a new disaster movie i have n't seen yet '' - only a moment later i realised i was so wrong ... 
  pretty sure they will do it . 
  even if only out of spite for 27:1 loss in ec presidency election . 
  their fm already announced that they will [ * play rough * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yu7t3/poland_says_will_play_rough_with_eu_after_tusk/ ) . 
  they do n't think in the logical criteria of what can be earned politically or what is good for poland , they only care about what * they think * will play well with their voters . 
  and that idea currently is that standing up to the eu is what they should be doing , basically : show people that the enemy is outside , that we 're in some sort of threat from the eu and they are the people who can defend poles . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ( nota bene , formulated by frenchman ), 
  i would n't say that , at least not about alt-right ( which was the topic up the tree ) - accusations are very , very often that they deny truth , be it about climate change , the way migrants get to us or crime statistics , for another example . 
  there is a good reason why conway came up with an `` alternative facts '' . 
   the idea that a country with high hiv rates can accuse the west of `` homosexual degeneracy '' is the most ironic shit in the yet and yet western countries led it slide . 
  what a fucking joke the eu is . 
  eu is not an authocratic state , we do n't have an entire networks of media devoted to * spreading our message * . 
  eu diplomats are that : diplomats . 
  not a 6-year old children throwing accusations at other states . 
  when russia throws an accusation - noone asks eu for response , and in almost all cases it 's not even a subject eu has any influence over . 
  pretty much everything russia accuses west about is solely in a hands of individual member states ( i struggle to think of one example where it would n't be the case , but i 'll let it slide with `` pretty much '' anyway ) . 
  english , obviously . 
  other branches could include german , french and spanish , basically : look at what rt targets . 
   at that point in time , the eu had no power and therefore nor responsibility to deal with that problem . 
  western media or even eu itself failed to communicate that . 
  all while rt was running 24/7 campaign blaming eu for the crisis to the point where you could see their phrases being copied by anglosphere media , even if only from their sheer laziness to create some original content and research into the topic . 
  buffer between us and ru . 
  something like that would allow ru to expand their sphere of interest through slowly corrupting lone states in that zone , placing pawns - autocrats - as a leaders of these states . 
  at some point it would contribute to another warsaw pact - which is what they ultimately want . 
  i 'd expect something bigger closer to the elections or after the first round . 
  le pen is a dream for them - i doubt anyone else leading in the race could give them more recruits . 
  glass celling . 
  she 's got nowhere to go unless some radical change happens . 
  ec president is like a prime minister . 
  epp campaigned with junker as their * pm * during the last elections , they won , now they have him as a * pm * . 
  i think it 's a good system and should n't be changed , though there certainly should be more big media debates with other candidates and ep elections should be more about ep parties and less of an opportunity to protest against current national government . 
  that 's nothing that can be changed by making the president directly electable .
