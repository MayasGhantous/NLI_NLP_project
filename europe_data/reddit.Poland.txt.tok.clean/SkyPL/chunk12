  * unspecified modernization of armoured divisions * simulators * unspecified amount of [ c-295m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eads_casa_c-295 ) and [ m-28 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pzl_m28 ) transport planes * unspecified amount of [ kto rosomak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosomak ) * unspecified amount of [ spike ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spike_%28missile%29 ) at missile systems * various patrol equipment ( everything from light transporters , uavs to c&c infrastructure ) * tons of other speculations , like a long range air-to-ground missiles ( for f-16s with up to 300 km range ) , ifvs , etc. 
  already ordered , to be delivered : * [ alenia aermacchi m-346 master ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alenia_aermacchi_m-346_master ) training jets * plus most likely several points from the list above ( i know kto rosomaks were already ordered , do n't know the details about other stuff ) . 
  all of this was planned long before ukrainian crisis . 
  with new * threat * military guys will most likely want to additional equipment , right now on top of the list is full-on anti-missile system ( plenty of speculation about getting us back again to build it , but some people say that a purchase of iron dome might be an alternative in case negotiations with us would fail again ) . 
  [ o_o wtf ?!,

  and ... that song is exactly suppose to win ... what ? 
  more like : eurosexism . 
  [ there 's another video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws0omv1k2zs ) , love the comment left on it :  podw\u00f3rkowa wyliczanka , do tego dodana melodia . 
  little bit of boobs , little bit of ass , little bit of blowjob , and we have a hit for crowds . 
  groundbreaking in a way that this * term * will most likely go through a period of reforms , reforms that will decide future of eu . 
  futile in a way that people ( heck : even many of the meps coming for their first term ) do n't understand how eu is working and many of them will make a decisions based on the other factors than simply looking for a good of their country ( eg . 
  to give a yellow card for a current government , so that they 'd do something coming country elections ), 
  / r/conspiracy -  `` all uprisings are done/paid by a foreign powers '' generalizations are really a bad thing , you know ? 
   you can not dictate , but you can choose whether you recognise a non-democratically appointed government . 
  anyway , legal or not that 's how things work , leaks showed the us were involved in the choice of government . 
  eu+r ussia should have taken that lead to ensure stability rather than leave it to the us who aims for geo strategical gains . 
  as i said : neither en nor us can or should enter the talks with russia or any other countries on deciding who will govern in ukraine . 
  there 's a difference between being involved by giving advices and directly deciding who will take a seat in a government after the negotiations between 3rd parties . 
  what you said reminds me a return back to the communist era when leaders of prl were decided in moscow . 
  oh , and fyi : not only us but also eu sent it 's advisers through the process , just like russia gave advices to yanukovych while he still was in power . 
  only after the shooting noone in kiev wanted to listen to russians any more , so no wonder russians did n't want to approve a new government . 
  even people from the party of regions [ turned their backs ] ( http://www.novostimira.com.ua/news-eng-100734.html ) on yanukovych after the tragic events . 
  then there 's a speculation that russians did wanted to see ukraine destabilized and all of the perfectly-executed plans we 've seen on crimea and see right now in an east ukraine were planned long ago and putin 's cabinet was just waiting for a pretext , so even if huge sacrifices would be made to get russia involved in a creation of the government - they still would put a terms that are intentionally impossible to be approved by anyone in kiev or western world ( eg . 
  federalization which already came up during the initial talks between eu-us-euromaidan-yanukovych-russia that ended up with a famous agreement that was later on broken by euromaidan / yanukovych ( depending how you look at it ) ) . 
   remove eu support and they lose legitimacy . 
  that 's not going to happen no matter what . 
  it 'd be nothing else than an empty threat . 
  whole eu instantly adopted a rhetoric of `` this was the first time people died for eu '' which made it impossible for eu to threat with withdrawal of it 's support . 
  theft then . 
   lot of arms and ammunitions had been sold to regime prior to arms rebellion . 
  fn herstal ( rifle shown of picture ) sold guns and rifles to libya , as well as beretta of italy . 
  actually every major manufacturer of weapons deal with qaddafi . 
  that recoil gun is old , from vietnam era , and that anti-aircraft launcher is the russian old one too . 
  i am not say there in no foreign sourced weapons that those are not ones . 
  then there 's a video thing which was very nicely debunked by omran . 
  seems like you found one of these blogs that focus on misinformation and making the author feel good for all the people reading stuff on his website yet at the same time too stupid to counter comments pointing out obvious mistakes in his way of thinking / analysis . 
  greens . 
  ready to ruin your world in next elections !, 
  lol, 
   ( for instance the little bit of radiation nuclear reactors emit in normal use ) the funniest part about it is that if you buy like a ton of coal and will put a geiger counter right next to it - it 'll show much higher reading than the one you get from standing right next to nuclear powerplant . 
  ( it 's the same if you stand on a ground with shallow coal deposits - in poland an upper silesia got locations like that , where half a meter under ground you can find coal ) radiation can be a really confusing thing if you do n't really understand how it works . 
  seems like some of the people from greens got no clue . 
    because putin will not stop in ukraine  opinion and conjecture , people said the same after georgia . 
   when the maidan took down the government , the eu should have entered talks with russia , to find an acceptable solution for an interim government they both supported , up until the next elections . 
  that 's illegal . 
  3rd parties can not and should n't dictate the way another country governs itself . 
  equally well we might simply do the partitioning of ukraine and just get over it . 
   and this should be done leaving no space for us interference , since they have no business getting involved . 
  us was involved long before interim government . 
  and by this - it 'd be impossible for them to move away . 
  besides - they 're the * world police * in their own eyes , so they would n't even want it in a first place . 
  he \u2260 his government . 
   you do know there is a middle ground between hitler and the eu right ? 
  you have n't noticed that each time something moves away from the rules of democracy and order - people automatically bring torches ? 
  just look at the eu - right now one of the major complains people have against it is the fact that presidents and eu commission members are not being picked in democratic elections . 
  with some people openly asking for direct democracy over eu laws . 
   who is to say that a concerted effort to compete with the rt narrative and some western psy-ops would turn us into the ghestapo ? 
  go , watch cnn if you want someone competing . 
   why ca n't there be a more streamlined military command and we not be nazis at the same time ? 
  care to elaborate ? 
   like a daimont in the light !, 
  :d hehehehe, 
   however , the most iconic romanian song is probably dragostea din tei the most iconic one is [ gypsy vampire warlock ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov3xp5zxsya ) - you just ca n't compete with that guy . 
  funny considering that uk is the one complaining most of all about eu laws and how they 're pushed down their throats ... 
  oh ... the gypsy vampire warlock from romania !, 
  that 's definitely the best one ever . 
  spain is jelaous, 
  yep , cause germany is a part of central europe too . 
  and it 's not just now - for example before ww1 germany and austria-hungary where also considered to be a central europe . 
   in areas such as currency we often pair with denmark and sweden , in energy with poland , in many other things with the netherlands ( that 's one/two examples per area . 
  i 'm sure there 's more countries as well ) . 
  very nice example of what i 'm talking about . 
  sometimes you agree , sometimes you do n't - each country got it 's very own vision of eu . 
  respecting vote of people does n't mean we ca n't discuss it , 
   i doubt the stakeholders within the eu is going to let that happen that 's something that many experts opting for uk leaving eu are afraid of - that pure economic calculation will loose to the principle of making an example out of uk . 
  yea , only they 're opposed of very different aspects than britain is . 
  yes , sometimes they do agree , but pretty much every one of them got different view of what eu should and should n't be . 
   ** the norway option **   it brings back :   * democracy   * sovereignty   * self-determination of our nation via   * major policy powers returned norway option basically means that you are a subject to majority of eu laws with ** no say ** in making them and at the same time also paying contribution into the eu budget ( norway contributes as much money to eu as if it 'd be a regular member ) while receiving very little to no money at all ( your farmers will be very unhappy about that , budgets of smaller cities will also suffer ) . 
  you get an *** illusion *** of self-determination . 
  oh , and please remember that norway option is against what ukip fights for - getting rid of immigrants from central europe . 
   back then `` you could tell just by the way people dressed and walked '' who was a pole and who a german , well , i do n't know how it is in germany , never been long enough there to make an observations like that , but in uk i can quite easily find poles in a crowd . 
  yes , sometimes i mistake them for czechs , lithuanian , etc. 
  but in general - * the way they dress , walk , and look like * is still a valid way of finding * comrades * . 
  how about we let the guy answer for himself ? 
  huh ? 
  the '' * abhorrent and arrogant * '' european court of human rights ( as farage put it himsel ) . 
   there 's a good rebuttal here :d this was a great one . 
  ukip at it 's finest . 
  why not ? 
   i 've had six conversations with lavrov in the last weeks . 
  the last one was kafka-esque , it was other planet , it was just bizarre . 
  nobody is better at telling you that red is blue and black is white ... that 's what we are dealing with . 
  and he figured it out just recently ? 
  that kerry guy is n't particularly bright , is he ? 
  `` reform '' is a magical key here that solves all of the problems everyone have with eu . 
  reality is much more harsh though , and the reforms one author might want to see ( in this case : '' * it would be almost unrecognisable from its current self * '' ) are vastly different from what other authors would like to see , and these are different from reforms that politicians of different parties would like to see . 
  catchy header though . 
  and when he is supposed to look for a job ? 
  almost like in poland .
