   it would counteract the main anti-eu sentiment of `` unelected people in brussels make decisions for us '' it would n't . 
  people who make these claims already think that about ep , despite of the fact that ep is elected and has a vote over laws . 
  eurosceptics like these are very difficult to fight , and they 'd always drift in a direction of * it 's all just a facade * rather than * wow , eu is changing to be more democratic * . 
  sentiments like that should be fought , but through * giving more power into ep hands * and informing european public , not giving more power and publicity in a hands of ep president ( or ec as some propose ) . 
  wow ... savage ... 
  yea , yea , a joke , but one person makes no difference , even if he has 10 children . 
  it 's a matter of many factors that affect whether people want to have children or not - and honestly : no government has fully figured it out yet , to bring some systemic solutions that would directly solve demographic issues . 
  in fact it can be argued that no government * can * solve it in a first place , as many things that make a statistical difference are not dependent on a government ( eg . 
  impact of mass media on a perception of family life and what it means to have children ) . 
  but they wo n't block them , they 'll just keep on adding fines until they comply . 
  and facebook wo n't quit either - it 's better for them to comply even with the harshest polices than to quit the eu market . 
  it 's not just there . 
  map listing root cause of quakes would be very informative . 
  i 'm fairly certain that pretty much everything in poland is caused by human activity , specifically mining . 
  i do n't know if people are aware , but there are dna test you can take to see if you 're resistant . 
  i took [ this one ] ( http://www.delta-32.com/ ) - it was quick and simple , but sadly : no luck with resistance . 
  : / ( in before : mythical polish race of black plague survivors . 
  juncker , is that you ? 
   they do n't call themselves left wing or right wing . 
  because they are a centrist party . 
  meps are directly elected by the citizens of each country . 
  to super-simplify it for you : bureaucrats are basically assistants , in the end everything depends on how meps vote . 
  that 's how it works in ep and that 's how it works in most of the national parliaments ( yes , i have a shocking news : bureaucrats are responsible for enforcement on laws and they do participate in writing laws on a national level ), 
   they are elected sorta they are elected . 
  ( yes , there 's a period right there ), 
   would need to queue [ apply ] , meet the accession requisites , hold negotiations and the result would be the one decided by those negotiations well , so nothing new here . 
  when they talked about fast-tracking membership it was n't about bypassing any of these points , but rather ensuring that everything is done as quickly as possible , without delays . 
  let 's give it a try , ** poland ** : * donald tusk won a second term of his presidency in the european council with support of all member states but one : poland . 
  * the candidate of the current government party ( pis ) was also polish , from the same party tusk was ( both : nationally ( po ) and eu-wide ( epp ) ) - jacek saryusz-wolski . 
  looks like he got played with zero benefits for himself ... he also got kicked out from po , but still remains the epp member . 
  country 's wondering why the heck he agreed to this debacle . 
  * before the vote : * mfa campaigned for saryusz-wolski * polish prime minister sent a [ letter ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yeatv/letter_of_prime_minister_beata_szyd\u0142o_to_the/ ) to leaders of other member states * mfa tried to delay the vote * after the vote : * polish prime minister [ chose to attack hollande ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yp27u/polish_pm_ridicules_fran\u0e23\u0e07ois_hollandes_4_poll/ ) . 
  she also was [ welcomed ] ( https://dorzeczy.pl/kraj/24043/powitanie-beaty-szydlo-na-lotnisku-kaczynski-jestem-dumny-ze-mamy-taka-premier.html ) after the summit , on the airport , with flowers . 
  leader of pis said '' * what pm beata szyd\u0142o has shown in brussels fills us with pride , she was in a very difficult situation and yet under pressure she defended polish cause . 
  this will remain in our memory and the history * '' . 
  * kaczy\u0144ski , leader of pis , also says that the eu is [ on path to disintegration ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yhi60/polands_kaczynski_says_eu_on_path_toward/ ) * pis meanwhile spins the entire thing as their own victory through [ national tv ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ylndt/polish_tv_tvp_airs_alternative_report_on_eu_summit/ ) ( also : eu bad , eu non-democratic ) * our minister of foregin affairs escalates the thing even further , this time saying that he will block other eu initiatives and [ `` play rough '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yu7t3/poland_says_will_play_rough_with_eu_after_tusk/ ) * [ continued ] ( https://uk.news.yahoo.com/poland-urges-eu-reject-tusk-presidency-124700104.html ) attacks on tusk , asked other leaders to reject him despite of 27-1 end result * poland [ threatened to sabotage the whole eu summit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yf6b0/poland_threatens_to_sabotage_eu_summit_in_bid_to/ ) * pis accepted a bill that allows them to [ takeover previously independent national council of the judiciary of poland ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/7,75398,21466394,pis-przejmuje-krajowa-rade-sadownictwa-ten-projekt-zmieni.html ) . 
  it sparked an outrage that was quickly overwhelmed by the whole tusk affair * there 's an ongoing campaign for a referendum regarding pis education reform . 
  also 3rd [ strike ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/7,75398,21481543,trwa-strajk-rodzicow-przeciw-reformie-edukacji-tysiace-dzieci.html ) of parents occurred , where they did not sent their children to the school , saying that they will continue striking every 10th of the month until the reform is stopped . 
  * there 's an ongoing massacre of trees . 
  to over-simplify : a bill entered in force allowing anyone to cut down any trees on their land . 
  this lead to a massive wood-cutting in a whole country , often times clearing space for large buildings in areas where they were not permitted before . 
  any attempts of opposition to fix the law were quickly struck down by pis . 
  accusations of lobbyism , corruption , and filling pockets of rich with money followed . 
  * related to the above through the minister of the environment : he took part in a [ hunt ] ( https://oko.press/minister-szyszko-wzial-udzial-rzezi-bazantow-groza-mu-konsekwencje-dyscyplinarne/ ) on [ pheasants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_pheasant ) which was basically : releasing them from the cage and shooting in place . 
  * [ women 's protests on 8 march ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/tylko-w-onecie/miedzynarodowy-dzien-kobiet-2017-protesty-w-calej-polsce-relacja/y2fmqwx ) , fuelled by many things , the most recent one being pis minister of health who said that the day-after pills are an early-abortion pills ( what sparked its own outrage in a medical community ) . 
  * there 's been a small and short scandal with pis-selected ambassador to germany , andrzej przy\u0142\u0119bski , being a former secret collaborator of the communist government of poland . 
  * pis government gave a green light [ for a canal ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5w3hqj/poland_greenlights_strategic_canal_to_baltic_sea/ ) through mierzeja wi\u015blana , giving poland independence from canal in russia * someone [ cut jackets ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/polska/spoleczenstwo/uczestnicy-miesiecznicy-smolenskiej-pocieli-kurtki-kontrmanifestantom-,artykuly,406758,1.html ) of the people protesting against mensiversary ( ? monthly anniversary ? ), 
  of the presidential plane [ crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) . 
  during said mensiversary crowd chanted that ' * they selected man with blood on his hands * ' ( implying donald tusk is responsible for the accident ) . 
  * related to the airplanes : ministry of defence [ rejected ] ( http://www.defence24.pl/559964,mon-odrzucil-oferty-na-srednie-samoloty-vip ) 2 ( all ) offers for the mid-sized vip ( government ) planes , noone knows what 's going to happen now with these . 
  but a day later they decided to [ buy ] ( http://www.energetyka24.com/560596,boeingi-dla-vip-z-wolnej-reki ) a large vip airplane from boeing without any procurement what so ever . 
  * minister of defence himself meanwhile went back to the topic of presidential plane crash , saying that [ russia was responsible ] ( http://natemat.pl/203463,po-tryumfie-tuska-w-brukseli-spadlo-morale-w-szeregach-pis-macierewicz-oglosil-wiec-nowa-ofensywe-smolenska ) for the disaster and they they have new , previously hidden , proofs and a results of an ` important ' experiments . 
  he did not disclose what these might be . 
  * [ training ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yhcqc/dutch_and_german_troops_training_in_poland/ ) of nato troops in poland * m2 bradley crashed with volkswagen polo ( bradley was on a transport truck , no causalities ) * redditor wrote a great overview of [ what happened in polish politics since the beginning of 2017 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xncov/2017_in_polish_politics_and_its_just_the/ ) - not complete , but none the less : worth attention . 
  it 's been a long week in poland ... and i 'm sure i still missed quite a few relatively important events . 
  but you get the tactics of our government : do so many things and create so much noise that people get tired of it and do n't pay any attention to what 's actually being done . 
  similar in poland - quite popular , spreads through the word of mouth . 
  sorry , that whole paragraph did n't make much sense with double ` most ' . 
  should be : most do n't vote , and among those that do vote - pis still has the largest support and it comes from a base for which that stuff does n't matter . 
  laughing through tears , laughing through tears here ... 
  still it 's annoying for the rest of the eu , cause other populist parties will proclaim it a great victory and a conspiracy of the establishment to pull them out of power after they lost democratic elections . 
  in a way it 's funny how they 've put themselves in a position where miserable defeat can be proclaimed as an enormous victory ( look no further than the yesterday 's 27-1 debacle of the polish government for another absurd example ) . 
  there are 2 large alternative parties in the parliment : [ po ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_platform ) ( former government party , one tusk was a founder and a pm of ) and [ nowoczesna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_\\ ( political_party \\ ) ) ( new centrist party funded by an economist , pis sells it as a ` refugee for former po people ' even though there 's very little to back that claim ) , there 's also [ kukiz ' 15 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukiz%2715 ) - nationalist-right-wing-populist party , but they 're no alternative to pis , more like their sister party/group of loosely-associated-individuals that supports pis more often than not . 
  the voices arguing for rule of law , transparency , reforms are everywhere . 
  i 'd say that there 's way more of them than the pro-government , but the government does n't care , just like they do n't bother with public consultations or dismiss proposed amendments * en masse * . 
  but you have to remember that stuff like rule of law , transparency , objectivity , truth , do n't really matter for most of the poles . 
  it 's kind of like in the us with trump supporters - they do n't give a shit about any of this either , or they think that the previous president ( in this case : government ) was far worse - and then there 's the silent majority that does n't vote for whatever reasons , be it that they do n't care or that they find politics way too disgusting . 
  ratification of the conclusions got nothing to deal with election of a president . 
  these two are separate . 
  so them not signing the conclusions will only be bs for domestic purposes , with zero power over election of tusk as a president . 
  it 's always easier to put the blame on the `` economic situation '' or `` politicians '' than oneself . 
  i for one welcome the change after hearing for x months about us elections . 
  finally some important european elections getting attention they deserve . 
  we 've had some other polls posted here showing the same , eg . 
  from [ february ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5v7sn2/france_dedicated_poll_macron_23_le_pen_226_fillon/ ) . 
  clearly there 's a desire to strengthen the bonds much further than governments like these in poland or hungary are willing to follow . 
  very likely it 's the only way for eu to progress further and eventually form a federation . 
  to pick only those that actually care and want . 
  with poland refusing to do something as basic in the name of unity as taking [ 10 orphans ] ( https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-02-03/the-latest-poland-refuses-to-take-in-10-orphans-from-aleppo ) , or [ closing ] ( https://wolnemedia.net/nbp-zlikwidowal-biuro-integracji-ze-strefa-euro/ ) office for the integration with eurozone - can anyone blame them for wanting to push the core faster ? 
  i know i ca n't . 
  multi-speed europe is not as much of a creation of germany , france & few others as it is a failure of poland , hungary & few others to adjust the speed to the rest of the union . 
  we 'll likely end up focusing on what eurosceptics wanted - economic union - while core of the union , with security it provides , will sail way . 
  it already exists . 
  was created in response to the migrant crisis . 
  tl ; dr in english ? 
  worth noting that it it 's not due to their investment in past , but rather the fact that they constantly pay for access . 
  ethernal access to the system is not what uk paid for . 
  that 60bn covers various commitments , including access to gallileo in the current budget period , but once it 's over and uk is out of the eu - they 'll have to negotiate access like any other 3rd party . 
  i think they do , and i think they are pretty competent in manipulation tactics they use . 
  the whole deal with smole\u0144sk is there to create and mobilise electorate base - and it is working , pis got much stronger and active during the elections base than any other party in the polish parliament . 
  for the rest of the people they got other bites , such as 500 + . 
  they 're pretty clever in targetting their message , even in choosing channels through which certain types of messages are distributed , targetting different groups of electorate , choosing their battles and creating further polarisation of the society at the time of their choosing while at the same time forcing opposition into constant defence . 
  they certainly learnt their lessons from their 2005-2007 coalition government . 
   which is funny because he was originally in the same party as tusk ( po ) but switched to pis afaik he did not . 
  he was excluded from po , but did not join pis . 
  he 's just their candidate to the presidency . 
  for now his membership is only with epp . 
   because he is flip-flopping and looking out for his career . 
  not exactly ... he 's been quite consistent in his views , some of which were uncomfortable for po long before the whole affair . 
  but it did n't matter because he 's been focused on epp affairs more than po .
