  i admire your government . 
  we ended up with folks who during last 3 days said that they still consider uk to be their key ally in europe and talk about being the biggest , most loyal ally to the us . 
  it 's almost as if they would n't even be watching any news since they got elected over a year ago . 
  but what you can expect from a party whose foregin minister thinks that san escobar supports it for the un security council ... 
  sounds about right ( if religion is any hint - ghana is mostly protestant , with 13.1 % catholic , 5.2 % declaring no religion , poland is 87.5 % catholic , 2.4 % declaring to be non believer ) . 
  i 'll use the same arguments some of the trump voters did - no better alternative . 
  of course not . 
  he 's just fine with grabbing women by the pussy whenever he feels like it . 
  i imagine someone could try selling it as keeping up to the level of south korea ... 
  is there even a single frenchmen on this subreddit that thinks she will win ? 
  cause i do n't recall one ... on the other hand i seen your argument several times , but nowadays it seems to be thrown around just for the sake of it , more than anything with an actual merit towards her victory in elections . 
  it 's enough he 'll make a big show out of every tiny accomplishment and people will likely elect him again . 
  look what he did with carrier deal - bribed company to stay , called that he saved more jobs than he actually did & in reality more jobs were created every day of obama 's presidency , without bribing , yet trump supporters think that his presidency was a disaster . 
  in modern us it does n't matter what you do , it matters how you advertise it . 
  [ edit ] : see [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/5pkjka/redditor_explains_how_trumps_alternative_facts/dcs8rl9/?st=iy9xwdzq&amp;sh=400dc361 ) for more eloquent version the point i was making . 
  if he cares about climate change then why he does n't have a programme to quit coal and gas powerplants by 2035 , and instead attacks nuclear , which is by far less harmful to the environment ? 
  it 's the same problem with all of these anti-nuclear , so-called pro-environmental politicians - always have a deadlines to quit nuclear , never to quit coal . 
  pathetic . 
  not to imply that it 's wrong or evil , but following the new testament you 're pretty much bound to be called `` leftist '' . 
  if noone does that then it might be a hint that you 're doing something wrong ... 
  core obviously would be the whole society groupped around [ rydzyk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadeusz_rydzyk ) . 
  but there 's more to the game , priests supporting nationalist movements ( eg . 
  jacek mi\u0119dlar ) or those openly supporting one party ( eg . 
  jerzy wi\u0119cek , adam kalina , antoni dydycz ) are not exactly pushing pope 's message to the crowds ... 
  possible . 
  i heard no studies about that , but anecdotal non-evidence is that most ukrainians i know here , in lower silesia , have some family that speaks polish and they learnt the language through them . 
  not at all : /, 
  you 're still ahead of everyone else in that matter . 
  nothing to show off , really . 
  there 's a shortage of low-skilled-low-wage employees . 
  they fill the gaps quite nicely - a number of western ukrainians tend to speak ( somewhat ) polish thanks to their grandparents , and others find it easy to learn due to relative similarity , they 're also quite young and willing to work for wages very few poles would . 
  it makes them a very welcome sight for a large number of employers . 
  economy 's growing , people are happy . 
  i like how he 's super-uncomfortable for nationalists who more than often strongly refer to their catholic roots . 
  basically here in poland a large part of our catholic church pretty much cut ties with the pope and his message , cause it 's not comfortable politically or ideologically . 
  and hopefully wo n't be , at least not during my lifetime . 
  the generation of my parents and grandparents lived through the hell i wish noone else in my or your family will have to expirience ever again . 
  in deed you have . 
  i was wondering if i 'll have to refute the usual trolling , but i see you 've got that covered already , hehe, 
  technically false . 
  ukrainians did during the maidan . 
  problem is : there are no similar programmes . 
  space agencies are very good in avoiding stepping on each other toes . 
  even in similar types of missions there tend to be a significant differences reducing the overlap to the minimum , or introducing brand new studies never done before . 
  and in space science even a single instrument can be more expensive than an entire ( small ) rocket . 
  random vaguely related note - among some part of the us space community focused on martian exploration proponents of lunar exploration are called '' * lunatics * '' . 
  it 's voluntary in the same sense eu membership is voluntary . 
  if you 're a member you have certain obligations and privileges . 
  cryosat is a part of [ earth explorers ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/observing_the_earth/the_living_planet_programme/earth_explorers ) within esa 's [ living planet programme ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/observing_the_earth/the_living_planet_programme/esa_s_living_planet_programme ) - that 's where you should be pointing at , 
  still there 's a lot of funding , great university base and comparatively large vc funds . 
  i would be far from calling their system `` shitty '' , cause i 'd quickly run out of adjectives to describe the state of things in countries like poland . 
  everything depends on brexit negotiations . 
  i doubt uk will do anything to compromise their science base , historically they 've been much more devoted to it than vast majority of eu governments ( which is shameful for us , everyone should put as much support as uk does , meanwhile in my own country it seems like we 're moving backwards ) . 
  eo budget is already high and the deployment of copernicus will open a new era in climate science , there 's more to do in individual members states than esa , to have these climate scientists working the enormous volumes of data that esa outputs for everyone willing to use . 
  worner says that unless something unexpected happens they 're membership will remain unchanged . 
  they just wo n't participate in eu programmes , key two being galileo or copernicus ( both enormous with notable participation of uk companies , so other member states are happy that the door for new contracts opens , but there 's still plenty where british can participate ), 
  they spend much less than europe . 
  it 's 20.5 billion usd for the entire period of 2016-2025 . 
  last 2 years they 've seen quite drastic budget cuts . 
  actually roi back to economy is 6:1 for investment in esa , so even purely on a financial level they do an amazing job . 
  it 's more than that . 
  for many americans he 'll become the face of europe and the primary source of information about the eu . 
  this will both : help building up support to trump 's anti-eu polices and build anti-eu moods in us population ( which due to the fact that they are english-speaking have unproportionally strong influence in europe through online channels like social media ) . 
  yeah , fox news viewers if anything already did not share any sympathy for the eu as such , but those caring little or nothing now will be pumped with nothing but negatives , even those that do n't exist . 
  in polish ( holandia ) , dannish ( holland ) , icelandic ( holland ) and few other languages it 's the official name of the entire country , not just erroneous reference . 
  i wonder what 's their justification of this ? 
  ( almost ) noone 's using the damn thing , it died out even here outside of occasional memes or trolling . 
  being anti-right wing polices and actions of israeli governments does n't mean that he is anti-israeli as such . 
  and to make it even worse : he 's using his money to promote this `` agenda '' !, 
  and that 's a lot of evil money !, 
  oh , the horror !, 
  so good we have murdoch !, 
  relax . 
  nothing 's wasted , not even a single satellite , and it 's not a 3rd in a row . 
  too much drama today ? 
  yea , yea , keep swallowing that russian propaganda . 
  amusing how suddenly people like schulz despite the fact that he was criticised on this subreddit almost all the time during his presidency . 
  in the end he was the one behind cancellation of the whole deal and a humiliation for 5sm , despite of the fact that number of members supported their membership . 
  do n't confuse gdp % with an actual amount of money spent and the capabilities of each country . 
  estonian army can be wiped out within an hour , despite of their 2 % that you praise so much . 
  they are incapable of carrying any load ( even their own , beyond their borders ) . 
  assistance can be provided by any means . 
  sending 20 first aid kits to satisfy the requirement . 
  not at all . 
  there 's plenty of self-respecting scientists publishing in meaningful research in other languages , in aerospace two largest in europe are german and french , they rarely reach the number of citations even some sub-mediocre research from uk does , so be extra-careful trying to make a stupid extrapolation like that . 
  and noone 's pretending any such thing . 
  luxembourg actually has fairly high corporate tax - it 's 29.22 % , it 's in eu 's top-10 , much higher than hungary 's 9 % . 
  why luxembourg is considered to be a tax heaven is due to the fact that they have a 0 % tax on dividends and capital gains ( conditions apply ) - so they are very specialized in what they do , i 'm not surprised at all that other countries , including hungary , overall look like a better places to choose for your daily tax heaven needs . 
  wow , hungary 's worse tax haven than luxembourg ... have to remember that . 
  only a some degree of `` accepting eu law without having a say in it '' is incorporated in everything from soft brexit , hybrid to some of the hard brexit scenarios . 
  the whole brexit debacle somehow forgot to mention that ... 
  one does n't exclude another , 
  i have a bad news for you then : it 's not even planned ( there 's one built towards rabka zdr\u00f3j , to be completed in 2018/2020 but beyond that - it 'll stay as it is ) . 
  mostly because just how enormously challenging it 'd be to accomplish ( either fuckton of tunnels or demolishing large parts of villages ) . 
  bs on top of bs . 
  no , she did not damage the eu , if anything he helped keeping it together , despite of what some bsrs like you think - she is not responsible for everything bad that happened during last 3 years , nor every solution implemented ( not even a significant portion of them , for that matter ) . 
  strategical decisions made were done with a wide support from most nations in the eu ( although not all of them , as it happens most of the time in democracy ) , and finally , if between other you think about refugee crisis and her role in it , i 'd first recommend you to read [ that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) in detail . 
   the eu all said yes read , learn to read . 
  it was a question during ep presidential debate , not a stance of the eu itself ( the current one is to keep both though there are movements to change it eventually ) . 
  nah , not that retard , again .
