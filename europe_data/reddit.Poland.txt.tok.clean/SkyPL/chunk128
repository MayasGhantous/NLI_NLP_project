  20-30 % lower launch price while helpful - is not be-or-not-to-be for any attempts of flying beyond leo . 
   what advantage does the moon have with respect to mars it 's closer . 
  it 's hard to overestimate just how much of a difference time spent travelling to and from the destination makes , it allows you to make an emergency evacuation almost at any time , it allows you to run near-real-time communications , it allows you to run literally hundreds of trips between earth and the moon during a single martian cycle , it requires less fuel ( if you take everything into account , including landing ) , it 's much more economically viable for commercial exploration , and it has fewer engineering challenges than trying to bring humans to the mars does , yet alone making sure that they 'll survive 2 + years on a surface out there . 
  moon is a gateway to the exploration of the entire solar system , mars is a gateway to ... mars . 
  yea , it 's been a significant improvement over what esa has how . 
  conference had a very positive outcome . 
  even norway managed to cancel expected tightening of its space budget , which was a good news to hear . 
   let the missions speak for themselves . 
  that was the policy ever since esa creation till roughly the late 2013 . 
  it was an utter failure , with almost noone knowing esa even exists , and those that heard about esa missions always thinking that these were nasa 's . 
  outreach is not an option , it 's a necessity . 
   with philae we watched a weird tv show where literally seconds after a quick nod from mission control we launched head-first into speech after speech from politicians you have some twisted view of what actually happened . 
  i watched the landing event live in one of the polish tv stations and do n't recall any politician , it was all centered on people in mission control . 
  and beyond that , in various media ( including 2 documentaries ) moments like andrea accomazzo jumping up with the entire team hugging and celebrating , interviews with tatooed matt taylor or fred jansen almost in tears of joy in his eyes , have gone into memory of thousands if not millions . 
  for many it was the first time they even heard about esa , or linked any particular mission to the agency . 
  yes , it was n't flawless , but it was without a doubt a great success . 
  it is , but good luck making it happen . 
  you 'd have to rewrite the entire copyright system , and that 's such an enormous challenge that i doubt any government or commission would be able to achieve that . 
  well , they said that they 'll fight tax avoidance , so that 's what they do ... though i do n't know how that vat on 22 eur gave you additional 13 eur ... that 's all it is - just added vat . 
  if stores scam you on additional fees exploiting law as an excuse then well - look for other stores , it 's open market , whoever offers the best sales wins . 
  nope . 
  whether you like it or not - there were cubans who welcomed the revolution and cubans who still think that his regime is/was a great thing . 
  to them he was a hero . 
  just like stalin was a hero ( and still is ) to many russians . 
  it 's just a diplomatic talk , do n't confuse it with praise or support , cause you only make yourself look like a fool . 
  fyi : there were two bills with * enough signatures to make them talk about it in their parliament * - and guess what ? 
  they dismissed one asking for liberalization of law in the first reading , while the one for increasing the ban went further on . 
   the way too soft reaction of pro-eu forces . 
  : / yep . 
  they accelerated process on an inter-governmental level ( eg . 
  eu border guard , upcoming eu army ) but forgot that the most important matter is making sure that benefits are clear for the citizens and that they want it first . 
  the thing you mentioned about press is also spot-on and really does not help . 
  that 's because falling down through the atmosphere is the best it did ... 
  just fyi : `` east of the oder-neisse line '' we tend to hate russian government and their actions , especially in foreign policy/invasions/little green man/etc . 
  russians , without going into politics , got much better opinion . 
  in an ideal world when media releases news headline that comes out to be russian propaganda - they should release a headline with equal importance pointing out that it was all bs . 
  or perhaps even do something unimaginable : fact-check . 
  then again : we 're far from ideal world ... 
  was n't it sold to chinese ? 
   not advertised enough , they advertise it on social media . 
  whenever eu spends money on tv , press or any other `` big '' adverts they are accused of `` spreading propaganda '' . 
   ignored by media ? 
  part of the freedom of media is freedom of ignoring stuff and focusing on bs in national politics 24/7 . 
  wow ... it 's like trying to explain economy to the child . 
  johnson 's more clueless than i expected .

  people in comments joke that someone managed to execute [ peking plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peking_plan ) yet again . 
  an interview in polish with anonymous major from armed forces of ukraine for largest polish defense industry website - defence24 . 
  interview is available only in polish , therefore i 've posted few highlights below - mind you : it 's my custom selection and interview contains many other informations . 
  i highly recommend reading it . 
  they just wait for ground to dry so that their equipment would n't drown in a mud . 
  they are still reorganizing . 
  attack right now could push them out of ukraine . 
  * in my judgment potential future attack would follow : mykolaiv ( large city between odessa and crimea ) , debaltseve and mariupol . 
  they wo n't concentrate on one point . 
  it will have an element of psychological warfare . 
  attacks from land as sea . 
  they are already preparing for that , landing crafts are being brought to crimea . 
  none of the western countries will resist . 
  * the biggest problem from the frontline troops point of view is that they do n't let them fight . 
  each time they make progress they 're asked to retreat . 
  * people wanted to create new , modern and strong army made of volunteers , but due to corruption and deals that was made impossible . 
  such army could win this war in two months , instead we 're giving up village after village , people see it and loose morale . 
  retreat from debaltseve was n't necessary , but it was forced on soldiers . 
  * civilians in eastern ukraine change their view on ukrainian army - they 're much more friendly since september when army started to help them with rebuilding and supplying aid . 
  till then everyone thought ukrainian army is made of fascists bringing nothing else than devastation . 
  ** geopolitics ** * destabilization is not only in an interest of russia , but also france , germany and the uk . 
  strong and stable ukraine is not comfortable for anyone . 
  neither west nor russia wants competition . 
  what happens is another [ ribbentrop-molotov pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  * sanctions are meaningless . 
  west sanctions leaders that do n't care about their own nation . 
  it makes no difference to them , they 're self-sufficient . 
  * information warfare is continuing . 
  we 've lost it and now europe will share the same fate . 
  all our values , culture , history and most importantly - truth is being altered or destroyed . 
  * we do n't need help from countries that left us - germany , france or uk - we 're hoping for countries that do understand us and are our neighbors - baltics and poland . 
  we 'd also like to count for other central european countries . 
  * even if they ( west ) want to train us - it 's not to deter russians or help us - they are just sending a message to russia that it should n't even consider attacking europe .
