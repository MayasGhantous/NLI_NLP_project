  only here it 's not 40/20 mph but rather 40/20 kmph . 
    sweden - scandinavian imperialists , fjords , ikea  fjords in sweden ? 
  where ? 
  that 's in there to portrait how much poles know about scandinavian countries . 
  usually very little mixing them around . 
  picture looks exactly like the last drunk scandinavian i 've seen . 
  our volcanoes have a * normal * names . 
  :p oh , and it was [ chrz\u0105szczyrzewoszyce ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ) , not przebrzezin . 
  i guess poles in general know relatively little about scandinavians . 
  the first thing that comes into my mind is [ the deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29 ) , one of the [ bloodiest conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/most_destructive_conflicts#wars_and_armed_conflicts ) in a history of man where the commonwealth lost roughly 1/3 of it 's population ( yes , swedes killed more people in 5 years than over 19 crusades managed to do over a centuries ) . 
  other than that we admire your social care system , iceland is a beautiful country ( used to be one of the top tourist locations for poles ) and we 're always jealous of you in every statistic  . 
  now immigration to sweden and norway seems to really improve the situation as people learn more about scandinavian countries through their friends and families . 
  one of the tales that i remember is about [ bornholm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bornholm ) where supposedly noone had locks in the doors , and on a fields you could find buckets for money where you paid and then dig out vegetables from a field if you wanted ... until poles came in and started to * exploit * people there . 
  \\* eyerolls \\* anyway - when i think of individual countries it 's like that : * norway - crude oil , tuna , breivik * sweden - scandinavian imperialists , fjords , ikea * finland - winter war , lakes , winter sports , freezing cold ( blame your flag with so much white ) * iceland - geysers , aurora , crazy-complex names for pretty much everything ( next time you erupt a volcano - rename it to something that can be pronounced , please ) * denmark - high-tech stuff , least scandinavian of all scandinavian countries , bornholm was very helpful during communism , we still have no clue how did you manage to grab greenland . 
  what you all share is obviously viking legacy ( muscled blonde males with blue eyes - aryans would be proud  ) , governments that actually know what they 're doing ( poles are always jealous to see governments that manage their countries well , cause we always look down at our own ) , obscure languages , you prefer to live in a smaller communities outside of the capital city when everyone know each other , plenty of wild forests ( especially in n-s-f trio ) , you seem to be ... indifferent to most of the stuff ( or as someone put it : socially awkward / snobbish ) . 
  yes , of course . 
  why would n't it ? 
  it 's one of the biggest wars in european history . 
  america agree money pretty, 
  i really wish scots would actually know for sure whatever they 'll be permitted to get into eu right after declaring independence ( if they 'd do so ) or if they 'd have to negotiate their way in like every other new country ** before ** voting in the referendum . 
  not that it 's a major deciding factor on a matters like that , but it certainly add something into equation for those in doubt . 
  fair enough , 
  nationalities . 
  so ukip came out to be hypocrites again ? 
  shocker . 
  anyway - i 'm curious how it compares to similar schemes in eu member countries . 
  i thought we 're going by individual countries ... 
   everyone assumes that freedom will be used to express differing opinions , but that is not always true . 
  freedom means that there are no obstacles to release anything you 'd like to . 
  it does n't mean that there is a ** demand ** for everything you publish . 
  where the demand is significant enough there will be a supply to satisfy it ( sooner or later ) . 
  especially now in a day of internet when pretty much anyone can open his own tv station , get a radio broadcasting , newspaper , book , etc. 
   in such case , a state can intervene by heavily funding more objective , non-commercial source of information most ( if not all ) european countries have got a state media . 
  only problem is that `` objective '' and `` state '' does n't mix well when it comes to media . 
  russian media are mostly state-controlled . 
  i doubt it 's really relevant to the discussion about free press  for that case - freedom of press index seems to be doing an excellent work in measuring the problem . 
  yes , very much agree . 
  that 's why i read news from different sources - internet is very much to thank for that . 
   but some countries have a more biased group of journalists than others and measuring this would be very interesting in deed . 
  well , that 's a wild statement with very little to back it up . 
  as you said - it 'd be very interesting to see anyone trying to measure it , but i have n't seen any studies on that topic . 
  imho pretty much all of the countries are filled with very biased media in various directions . 
  if anything - some countries got more press that 's ** far ** right or left and that might be measured by the volume of sales and number of options , but that 's pretty much all . 
  freedom of press means that you can have press biased in every direction and it 's not being crippled by anything else than natural market competition . 
  vast majority of content in media are commentaries ( even simple news are often mixed with commentaries - it 's often done by something as simple as choice of words , for example : `` demonstrates '' vs `` separatists '' vs `` rebels '' vs `` terrorists '' ) . 
  and these by their nature take a stand on this or the other side . 
  that ** is ** their job . 
   if the press uses its freedom to undermine objectivity and freedom of unbiased information it has no function . 
  press is never objective . 
  news agencies sometimes are , but even there you can often see bias in this or the other direction by a choice of words or topics . 
  it was behind poland since 2012 , before snowden case . 
  ( just look up the table on wikipedia - it 's all there ), 
  looks about right . 
  though i 'm little bit surprised that poland got freer press than uk or france , both aspiring to be * european beacons of democracy * . 
  ( poland wins with us too , for that matter ), 
  what are these weird rectangles ? 
  on germany or between france and spain ), 
  that 's suppose to be controversial or what ? 
   the first minister said it was a `` good thing '' confidence had returned to the country yep . 
  that 's truth , and it 's very nicely reflected in independent surveys . 
  i totally agree that it 's a good thing when people feel confident about their country - it encourages economic growth and in general : people are happier , which is always nice . 
   and called the russian president `` more effective '' than his portrayal by the press suggests . 
  well , regardless of what press suggests , and by what means he achieved that - putin is an effective * leader * , probably the best one russia had since it 's transformation . 
  [ here is a nice summary of where he did well ( and where failed ) ] ( http://en.ria.ru/analysis/20080301/100381963.html ) . 
   on sunday mr salmond 's office attempted to distance itself from the remarks , pointing out they were made before the annexation of crimea . 
  even if he 'd do it after the crimea - there 's nothing wrong with his statement . 
  he just pointed out an objective truth . 
  we start linking to random wikipedia articles for no reason what so ever ? 
  if so then [ yikes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plasmodium_diminutivum ) ( yes , i just clicked `` random article '' ) . 
  erm ... 
  i thought i explained that already . 
  excessive farming is the cause why * every day , 288 hectares of farmland are lost * . 
  what would you expect farmers to do ? 
  preventing landslides in any ways other than seeding trees with a very deep root system ( not all kinds of trees give you the effect ) and waiting till they grow to hold the ground and prevent landslides is extremely expensive , it 's usually done by sticking few meters long poles into the ground . 
  it 's not feasible for anything else than dedicated constructions like building houses on a hill and preventing landslides of a risky ground right above it . 
  planting trees can be done , sure , but it almost never happens . 
  reasons are quite obvious : it takes minimum several years till trees develop roots long and strong enough to make a difference , and the density of trees per acre depends on many , many factors , in either case : you give up a notable portion of land ( and by this : income ) to something that might or might not pay off ( first of all there 's a risk landslide will happen before trees are ready , and secondly there is a hope that it 'll never happen ( some types of the ground are more prone to landslides than the others ) , so noone risks loosing money on expertise , seeds , and wasted space ) . 
  oh , and to make things even worse : you ca n't just plant these trees on your own farm and think it 'll prevent the landslide - they need to be planted in specific , crucial locations where landslides might begin , and that means some people might be forced to sacrifice all their land for the good of others . 
  reaching an agreement on something like that is next to impossible . 
  even more so because after the landslide you still can farm that ground on a next season . 
  so loss for a single farmer is n't enough to justify expense . 
  must be some different eu than the one i live in . 
  ukraine too, 
  so true , so true . 
  most of the discussions i have with people about eu resolve around them giving various euromyths to show how eu is evil , me trying the debunk them , and they either not believing me or saying `` do n't you see the whole picture ?! '' . 
  lol, 
   jobbik got employment and the cultural committee instead , the latter includes education as well . 
  yea ... back in a day ( ~ 2006 ) in poland we had our nationalists ( [ lpr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/league_of_polish_families ) ) in control of ministry of education - it ended up with plenty of shit and tons of controversial ideas . 
  it 's been so bad that , according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_giertych#minister_edukacji_narodowej ) , 137 000 people signed a petition to dismiss them from a ministry and ambassador of israel in poland said that he 'll avoid any contacts with the minister . 
  you got just a committee so it should n't be that bad , but ... brace yourself . 
   romanian pm says might be bullshit everything that every pm says qualifies as `` might be bullshit '' . 
  usually it 's excessive farming and deforestation . 
  then you add intense rain over a short period of time and it 's done . 
  the fact that summers in italy are very hot only helps to accelerate the process ( dry ground is much more prone to landslides after massive rainfalls ), 
  some people still think in cold war terms . 
   they talk about `` godlessness '' and `` lack of patriotism '' . 
  oh come one !, 
  both of these are good things !, 
  poland stronk !, 
  yes , i remember it .
