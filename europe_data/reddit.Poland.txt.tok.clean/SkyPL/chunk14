  fascist right sector is killing ukrainian children . 
  what a pile of bullshit . 
  i guess this thing breaks a new record in talking shit in a topic of ukrainian crisis . 
  yep . 
  that 's basically the problem - brits worked as a doors for us to spy on an entire eu . 
   it 's just a different use of the wording `` french '' , and the american use makes little sense . 
  that pretty much nails it . 
  the way americans claim the be this or that is rather nonsense from a perspective of european . 
  especially when in many cases we 're talking here not about their parents being of a given nationality but grand ( grand ( grand ( grand ) ) ) parents .

  now here the weird thing begins : [ osce states on twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/osce/status/459747578297716736 ) that these were n't osce monitors but rather a team sent under [ vienna document ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_document ) on military transparency ( signed between many also by ukraine and russian federation ) . 
  there is no official statement from osce on their website . 
  german defense ministry meanwhile said that the [ mission is overseen by the vienna-based osce ] ( http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/04/25/idinb4n0m002q20140425 ) . 
  ukrainian ministry of interior affairs [ released a statement ] ( http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/article/1036294?annid=1036295 ) saying that 7 osce observers were captured with 5 ukrainian soldiers and a driver ( i guess driver was also part of the team under vd2011 ) - ukrainian government tried to negotiate their release , but response was that they needed to contact authorities in russian federation before doing anything . 
   dear federalists , wrong reddit .

  english with irish accent . 
   i was led into a room where i was accused of working for the cia , fbi , and right sector , the ukrainian ultra-nationalist group . 
  they forgot about anonymous , jews and illuminati . 
   i do n't yet know what he got for my release , but i hope it was n't very much , because no one should be allowed to take hostages no matter what their political demands are . 
  well , that 's a very good question : what happened that he got release ? 
  never the less - i 'm most glad to see him free . 
  he is one of the best journalists out there . 
  and then who 's going to reduce power of socialists ? 
  i 'm not the one who down-voted you ), 
  even if they 'd form a group - it 's still not going to have a majority necessary to make any decisions . 
  so in a current perspective it 's meaningless . 
  reading comments - apparently brits do n't care . 
  and everyone who dares to criticize is automatically * paid eu troll * . 
  it 's still a week to the ruling . 
  and it 's quite obvious that country filled with hqs of banks operating in eurozone will be opposed of anything that might hurt their interests . 
  they 've been moving since yesterday afternoon , some of them conducting exercises as close as 1km away from the border . 
  still though none have entered ukrainian soil just yet - but it 's pretty much exactly the same scenario we had in crimea . 
   in europe , by contrast , easy access to the local printing presses before and after the foundation of the ecb , together with the new fiscal rescue mechanisms , ensure that investors start to become nervous only when debt ratios are 10-20 times as high . 
  as a result , the debt level rises until it spirals out of control . 
  ecb or euro got very little to deal with the real cause of a problem . 
  if not ecb - governments would play on other mechanics , either messing with constitutional limits of debt or by printing money . 
  difference is that in eurozone when individual countries reach their threshold of debt suddenly whole eurozone is in trouble , countries can not be left on their own to rot . 
  as long as citizens are too stupid to understand that their benefits need to be cut down in order to reduce national debit and there is no massive pressure on the governments to reduce expenses - debts will increase and next crisis caused by this will be impossible to avoid . 
  and as far as i see - change is not going to happen any time soon . 
  populists are still very strong in eu ( if not to say that they 're getting even stronger now than ever ) and an enormous opposition to cutting spendings is still there , with protests in greece even further discouraging governments to make any decisions that are certainly necessary in a lot of countries ( including these outside of eurozone , like poland ) . 
  i 'm from upper silesia too , and never heard it . 
  the whole thing with visit cards was funny too . 
  why al qaeda does n't do that ?!, 
  it 'd make everyone 's life so much easier ... lol, 
   singing is n't exactly hard . 
  i would disagree with this part ... 
  no stalin on the list ? 
  seriously ? 
  hitler was just a spark , legacy of stalin still burns today . 
  imho the version of the hitler/stalin/churchill trio is much more accurate . 
   romanian ( rumu\u0144ski , adjective ) means a thing of unknown and untrusted origin . 
  it does ? 
  long story short : russia is against eu and everything that 's against eu is automatically good . 
  i do n't see a problem to be honest . 
  pretty much every new country joining eu has it 's own language , so in grand scheme of things ireland using irish is n't anything extraordinary . 
  yea , they could use english , would be cheaper , but irish is an official language of ireland , so noone can really forbid them to use it in europarliament . 
  welcome to the polish scandalize , conspiracy theorist & far-left magazine . 
  for a preservation of mental health i advise to avoid it like fire . 
  btw : reminded me of [ mr. putin blamed poland and lithuania for inciting protests and training protesters in kiev 's main square , known as the maidan . 
  meet the lithuanian terrorism international school ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zpa8y/mr_putin_tuesday_blamed_poland_and_lithuania_for/ ) - sounds similar , does n't it ? 
  owner of this magazine is extremely sentimental to the communism , one of polish historians called him the `` goebbels of [ martial law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martial_law_in_poland ) '' . 
   the upper house should act as advisers , nothing more free money !, 
  awesome . 
  where do i sign up ? 
  seriously though : i never was a fan of a systems where we had a whole body created solely for an advisory purpose with no real power in anything . 
  though i certainly agree that eu needs a clear distinction between legislative , executive and juridical powers for it 's bodies . 
  for those interested in net neutrality it might be worth reading through the answers we got here on reddit in [ ama with margrete auken , member of european parliment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20q04q/i_am_member_of_the_european_parliament_margrete/ ) . 
  it 's very complex issue , really . 
  i can barely lick the surface here . 
  imho the major cause of that lays in a fact that major part of eu knows first hand what censorship and what propaganda is from an * evil * state ( americans historically had it done only by their own state ) . 
  what americans consider to be `` patriotic '' for us , europeans , very much reminds the best days of cccp / goebbels ( no offence meant , we 're just by far less patriotic than americans ) . 
  yea , methods changed since then , sure , but in many ways restrictions you put on the internet remind people the restrictions on a printed press from communism ( or ww2 nazi propaganda ) , so that 's why we 're resisting by far more to the influence of government / corporate lobbyists than you do , and that 's why we still have meps fighting for neutral internet and it 's much easier to find a support for that in eu than it 'd be in us . 
  yes , pretty much every point i gave here can be countered with various examples where it 's not truth ( eg . 
  uk was n't occupied by nazis nor communists - but on the other hand now it happens to be the most restrictive country when it comes to the internet freedom in eu ) , europe got vastly more diverse history than us , but i 'm trying to give you an idea how history shaped the behavior of current politicians . 
  then there is a fact that european anti-piracy agencies are uncoordinated and each one speaks with it 's own voice , so there is not so much of a directed pressure from them . 
  they also got lower budget than us counterparts and they 're mostly focused on affecting laws in individual countries as opposite to affecting eu parliament and commission ( they still do it , only not on a riaa scale ) . 
  i 'm certain other people can give you much more ideas why law is so different between us and eu when it comes to this matter . 
   my only guess is that each member state in the eu has several news stations many of them are owned by few corporations across different countries printing different titles . 
  axel springer is most obvious example , and often relations between large media conglomerates in eu are so complex that you 'd be amazed . 
  yes , there is more `` free '' press in eu than us , but the difference is n't as huge as you might think on a first glance . 
   or is it just that the eu is so new , they 're trying to put on a good face ?
