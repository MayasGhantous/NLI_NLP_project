   israel is certainly culturally close to europe i do n't think so . 
  they 're very distinct ( they 're international culture , but with solid roots in middle east , not europe ) and i really doubt any notable percentage of them would think of themselves as a europeans .

  i really hope guy will come out of this safe and sound . 
  i really , really like his materials , one of the finest pieces of journalism i seen in recent months . 
  [ here is his coverage of ukrainian crisis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plw613m86o5o7dfgzuucd_pvwbocdo472b ) .

  let 's face it : this whole syria thing is shit on a both sides . 
  imho noone from the `` western '' world should have any involvement in that what so ever . 
  it 's either regime that killed unknown amount of people ( only question is if these were hundreds or thousands ) , or the future terrorists who right now cut off the heads of their opponents shouting allah akbar . 
  or actually , if forced to choose - i 'd pick assad regime like russians did . 
  at the very least he was somewhat predictable and ( to a degree ) kept order in the country without turning it into afghanistan . 
  oh , that 's a nice website . 
  my results : * labour , lib demo : 75 % * conservatives : 73 % * scots : 72 % * plaid thing : 69 % * green : 62 % ( thought it 'll be more ) * ukip : 52 % * bnp : 51 % looks like i 'd be better scot than brit , 
  oh , love it . 
  even my friends who know nothing of british politics laughed . 
   well done . 
  who would have thought farage is a hypocrite ? 
  results of voting between people from the audience on whatever uk should not take part in the first world war . 
  before the debate : * for ( uk should have not fought in the ww1 ) - 19 % * against ( uk should have fought in the ww1 ) - 40 % * do n't know - 41 % after : * for - 27 % * against - 62 % * do n't know - 1 %, 
   you know that every lobbiest in brussels from bp and shell will be all over the drafting of this union . 
  they are for years , and not just in brussels but also every single country in the europe . 
  obviously they are most active in countries that extract or consume largest amounts of gas and oil , like uk or germany , but they keep activity in smaller countries too . 
   so the idea for this union is a good thing , but i fear the implementation . 
  me too . 
  but as they say : no risk , no rewards . 
  sounds brilliant , 
  i 'm quite sure that market could keep current standards if it means less noise and healthier life . 
  transcript ? 
  robots are gon na make great britain fall , and unemployment go out through the roof !, 
  depends for who - one that gets the service or one that provides it , 
  well , that sounds nice . 
  still below my needs ( if recharging would take 10 hours than i 'd need at least 1100km range ) , but it 's a very positive development . 
  hopefully in less than 20 years we 'll be able to make a trip across the europe on a single charge , 
  yea , they make penguins . 
  you know - that silly-looking missile . 
   also the promotion of other fossil fuels in favour of other sustainable sources of energy worries me a lot . 
  you read something that is n't written anywhere there . 
  it 's not `` instead '' it 's `` in addition '' . 
  increasing renewable energy sources is , was , and will be a major target for the eu . 
   however , it seems that this would be a ploy by current eu members to push fracking of shale gas down our throats . 
  nope . 
  more like : make legislation easier and setup common standards so that those countries that want them ( like poland ) could get lower prices and simplified procedures . 
  those that do not want fracking wo n't loose anything . 
   we could end our dependencies on all the fuel we get from drilling in the earth within 15 years if we wanted to . 
  debate whatever eu economy can afford it or not is still running . 
  some countries can , and they aim meet this goal at various points of time . 
  eu is consistently pushing renewables down the throat of all eu countries whatever they want it or not , so there 's no reason for you to complain , i guess . 
  better than 86th * subyekt * . 
   when needed , rent a large ( or fast , or whatever ) gasoline car nice idea , sadly : way too expensive . 
  especially if you take longer trips ( say : 2 weeks ) or you want to have car delivered to your doors . 
   electric cars need to be better in all aspects before they will take off . 
  i 'm not that demanding . 
  it 's enough if they could make 5-6 hours trip on a one charge and recharging would be very quick ( say : replace accumulators instead of charging them ) . 
  i really like them  great work germans . 
  funny , really well designed and at the same time get right to the point . 
  [ i 'll leave it here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpkkqnijnsm&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=257 ) . 
  i do n't mind unified id cards ( just like i do n't mind unified registration plates ) , but only if they do n't contain any biometric data ( fingerprints , retina scans , etc. ) . 
  there 's nothing good that can come out of carrying such a sensitive data in your wallet every day . 
  i think that the rules in which eu contribution is set should be equal to everyone . 
  not `` everyone with exception of uk '' . 
  i thought you were talking about legitimate concerns , not what some people might or might not feel . 
  brits got as much say in what lives of everyone else are in the eu as they got in yours . 
  and brits exploit it by far more than any other eu nation - just look at the eu rebate . 
  nope , the problem are banks and governments lying to both : it 's own citizens and international organizations . 
  euro is just a victim of a propaganda . 
   using the euro sent almost all of southern europe into default because of the faulty way the eurozone is constructed . 
  it was because of lacking regulations and `` creative accounting '' . 
  euro was n't a problem - countries and banks exploiting the system were . 
  poland still is n't bothered : / as if meeting higher financial standards would do any harm . 
   what are some things i 'm missing ? 
  hacking , bounty hunters , mercenaries , organ trade , kidnapping ... you get the picture . 
  russian is the language of internet criminal underground . 
  poles are very very active in the internet . 
  one of the most active non-english speakers group in the internet . 
  just look at the wikipedia . 
  and it 's hardly an exception . 
   leaving the eu would be economic suicide , though . 
  no it wo n't . 
  it 's ridiculous statement . 
  but certainly uk will loose a lot . 
  how much ? 
  depends on a negotiations , it 's very hard to tell . 
  they might end up with the largest economical crisis in last 50 + years , or they might barely feel it at all . 
   completely ignoring any legitimate concerns people might have which might cause them to vote ukip . 
  as if these posters would focus on legitimate concerns instead of populist propaganda . 
   depressing to see so much hate and fear receive so many votes . 
  it gets votes because we want everyone to see that it 's a propaganda and what 's wrong with ukip lies . 
  not because we support fud . 
  you forgot one important part : uk is the only eu country that gets a discount and does not pay it 's fair share to eu budget . 
  other countries , notably france , pay additionally to cover uk membership in eu . 
  thank margaret thatcher for that brits . 
  austria is aiming for 100 % self-sufficiency in energy by 2050 thanks to renewable energy , so hopefully - you wo n't have to worry about it at all . 
   if you try to argue with the false information , you get massively downvoted for `` siding '' with putin i would say that few recent cases , including the one where notes regarding jews being forced to sign on a list , are there to prove this statement false . 
  yep . 
  it makes no sense what so ever . 
  you do n't see a problem - there is no problem . 
  history of [ polish-scottish relations ] ( http://voices.yahoo.com/scottish-polish-connections-history-relations-between-2536000.html ) is very long and friendly through the time . 
  there 's plenty of interesting facts there and even now poles see scots very positively , perhaps because we share a history of being subjugated to other nations . 
   we love them .
