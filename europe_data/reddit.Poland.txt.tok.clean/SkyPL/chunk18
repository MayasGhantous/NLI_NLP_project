  besides - candidates for members of european commission are chosen individually by the eu governments , and europarliment or european council is required to approve , so any piece of legislation still needs to be approved by people who have a direct democratic mandate . 
  it mostly is . 
  eu got a very , very limited authority to affect economy in individual countries . 
  otherwise we 'd solve problems in spain already . 
   what are the great songs from your country ? 
  there are none . 
  ^ ( typical polish negativity ), 
  for un to be of any relevance all of the countries with veto right would have to give it up . 
  but they wo n't - certainly russia and us never will - so i personally do n't have any hope in un what so ever . 
  it 's a joke . 
  pathetic imitation of what it was suppose to be with no relevance to the real world outside of un halls as soon as interests of any country with veto right come on the board . 
   a lot of people do n't take a vocal opinion against him they do n't do anything against him . 
  not even during elections . 
  right now support for putin clearly goes up across the board . 
  imho support for putin is honest - does n't have anything to deal with having `` endangered jobs '' or anything alike . 
  all of the surveys made across russia show one thing : support for putin and actions of russian government is there in the society . 
   but not nearly as much as would appear to the naked eye it 's as much as independent surveys show - which is very close to what appears to the naked eye . 
   they did n't feel entitled and proud of their deeds for the rest of the century . 
  that 's imho one of the key issues . 
  russians are still proud of ussr and `` achievements '' of stalin . 
  germans despise hitler and a 3rd reich . 
   with the most important macro-economic decisions being made centrally within the union . 
  voted by representatives of all the members . 
  that 's the difference - each country still has a say in it 's own interests . 
  yea ... the blue one ... gash ... , 
   hi , my name is kelley and i am addicted to polish decorated easter eggs people have some really creepy addictions ... , 
   the u.s. readiness to impose new economic sanctions on russia over ukraine is offset by the european union 's reluctance to introduce stronger measures that could threaten its already fragile economic recovery . 
  let 's face the reality : us readiness to impose sanctions is there only because us has next to no business relations with russia . 
  and you know what 's funny ? 
  even despite of that us did n't do anything significant beyond what eu did . 
  plot twist . 
  someone in comments under that article put a key issue :  but the alliance has geopolitical importance . 
  failing to uphold article 5 would end nato . 
  so even if us would n't send it 's army to defend `` one city in estonia thats 90 % russian '' i 'm quite sure other countries would , including poland . 
  besides - what 's up with these `` nukes '' anyway ? 
  guy seriously thinks that the only way to stop russian intervention is by nuking one of the russian cities ? 
  time to grow up , or something . 
  if any of the us leaders would share this attitude world would be a nuclear wasteland by now . 
  yea , sure it is . 
  noone expected everything to be done in a day , right ? 
  but it 's better to have an alternative in several years than do nothing . 
  improving relations with iran will give us a chance to affect this country in some ways and improve situation there . 
  cause after budapest memorandum came out to be worth as much as paper it was written on we lost pretty much all of the arguments we had to do anything about iranian nuclear program or their lack of democratic standards . 
   it 's the un 's job to come to an objective conclusion . 
  un is paralysed imitation of what it 's suppose to do . 
  russia has a veto right - it makes it impossible to reach any `` objective conclusion '' there unless this `` objectivity '' will be in line with what russia wants . 
   personally i am for un peacekeepers from a neutral country , may be germans , swedes . 
  only problem is that every eu country is now viewed as a side in this conflict , so german or sweden would n't pass . 
  it 'd need to be someone from south america or so to be considered `` neutral '' . 
   he called for a joint `` anti-terrorists '' operation with un peacekeepers . 
  clearly guy has no clue what blue helmets do . 
  meanwhile [ `` green men '' arrive in slovyansk ] ( http://zn.ua/ukraine/k-boevikam-v-slavyanske-pribylo-podkreplenie-iz-zelenyh-chelevechkov-143240_.html ) . 
  looks like the situation will not calm down any time soon . 
  `` merkel candidate '' ? 
  why not `` cdu candidate '' ? 
  is that one of these bs journalists promoting `` germany = = merkel '' point of view ? 
  it 's going to have any capability of dodging ciws ? 
   france and the uk will co-ordinate their development and acquisition approach to eliminate duplication in the missile sector great news  wish more countries in eu would follow the same pattern . 
  some of the comments there are really funny . 
  luxembourg crush russia . 
  or  well if luxembourg says so it must be alright . 
  beware russia , bankers on a crusade , for king and dividends !, 
   it 's more complicated . 
  all of the linguistic matters are always more complicated than one sentence  in either case though i think we both agree that this whole section `` concerning the etymology of the word `` ukraine '' '' is missing the truth . 
   i would n't say so . 
  at least not to someone with a basic knowledge of the language . 
  well then , this `` basic knowledge of the language '' must be extremely rare in poland , cause relatively few people know that * pierogi ruskie * relates to ruthenia . 
    `` ruskie '' or `` rusek '' as a pejorative term is used not only for `` russian '' ( though mainly ) , but also as `` ukrainian '' weird , i never really heard '' * rusek * '' being used to describe ukrainian . 
  i guess it 's some regional thing . 
  news agencies still ca n't grasp an importance of decisions made by europarliment and how it affects life all across the europe . 
  it 's slowly changing , situation is better than the last time , but imho it 'll take at least another cycle till we 'll be able to get any good informations about elections on an eu-wide level . 
  poland seems to be off . 
  according to most of recent polls po ( part of epp ) wins with pis ( part of ecr ) . 
  this could give epp a win in the europarliament . 
  in either case though : it 's going to be a very close call .

   therefore `` \u0443 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f '' ( u kraya -- at the edge ) [ of russia ] . 
  funny how in poland it 's tough as '' * at the edge of polish-lithuanian commonwealth * '' , not russia . 
  little bit over 200 years ago ruthenia was south-eastern edge of polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  and it 's been under control of poland and lithuania since 12th century if i 'm not mistaken . 
   200 years ago ukrainians used the term `` \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438 '' ( rusyny -- ruthenians ) to identify themselves . 
  we can not translate the term `` \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d '' ( rusyn -- ruthenian ) as `` russian '' . 
  it is a big mistake . 
  it 's quite common mistake made in polish too , but that 's because russia and ruthenia share the same core . 
  the primary example of that mistake would be that many poles are thinking that * pierogi ruskie * are russian pierogi when in fact these are ruthenian pierogi . 
   the fact that muscovy ( present-day russia ) was n't a part of the grand duchy of lithuania means that `` zemlie ruskoe '' ( lands of ruthenia ) , means `` lviv region '' ( in broad sense -- `` ukrainian lands that were a part of the grand duchy of lithuania '' ) and therefore has nothing to do with russia , and , consequently , can not be translated as `` russian lands '' . 
  it specifically relates to [ ruthenian voivodeship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruthenian_voivodeship ) which was part of administrative division in polish -- lithuanian commonwealth . 
  still though administrative `` ruthenia '' was only a part of what 's considered a [ ruthenia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruthenia ) in ethnic perspective ( most , if not all of which was also a part of the commonwealth ) . 
  i do n't understand what author wanted to say in this whole section other than the fact that ruthenia existed outside of muscovy - which is nothing surprising , quick search in wikipedia could tell you that without invoking some centuries-old documents  . 
  really ? 
  wow ... far right never ceases to amaze me . 
  this whole thing sounds like something taken out of a hollywood movie . 
  looking forward to the results of this investigation . 
   meanwhile , one nationalist group , the united kingdom independence party , has refused to work with her . 
  no meaningful alliance than . 
  good , let them stay that way . 
   not only am i not anti-semitic , but i have explained to my jewish compatriots that the movement most able to protect them is the front national , you might not be anti-semitic , does n't mean people in your party are n't  . 
  if there 's something that can unite these far-right parties - it 's an anti-semitism . 
  for those unaware : ict stands for [ information and communications technology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/information_and_communications_technology ), 
  ** poland ** well , we have [ congress of the new right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_the_new_right ) which according to recent polls will enter polish parliament for the first time ever in upcoming elections .
