  but they 're not really a far right , though very close to that . 
  most of the people think of them as a condensed craziness but certainly they do have some ideas that can be accepted by wider audience - see ideology section of the article on wikipedia . 
  then there 's [ nop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_revival_of_poland ) which is a classical example of far-right group : fascist , anti-semitic , homophobic party of white power skinheads . 
  support ? 
  below 1 % . 
  some believe that even their own members do n't vote on nop in elections . 
  oh , and just to be clear : party like that would be illegal in poland , however they keep on dodging bullets by insisting that what their members do in their free time got nothing to deal with activity of party itself . 
  there were attempts to delegalize it but general consensus seems to be that it 's better to have all of these retards indexed in one organization and keep them on a list so that police and special forces would have it all in one place instead of letting them spread around forming dozens of groups doing whatever they want . 
  in either case though they have no slightest chance of getting into parliment or ... anywhere else for that matter . 
   i 'm just as concerned about the ultra-liberals running europe as we speak o_o which europe is the one you speak of ? 
  cause the europe i hear about is constantly accused for being very socialist - pretty much a continent that 's the most pro-social in the world right now . 
   yes , i was saying that ukip and 5sm are not far-right . 
  far right perhaps not , but they are a right-wing party . 
  it 's a classical [ right-wing populist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right-wing_populism ) party - if you 'd look for an example of these in europe ukip would be near top of the list . 
  they 're anti-immigration from eu . 
  if immigrants are n't from the eu - they 're fine . 
   authoritarian putin regime so ... it 's official now ? 
  cia factbook is going to change it 's entry for russia from `` democracy '' to `` authoritarian regime '' ? 
   at the very least that a lot of the bill for expensive security should be helped by countries that may not be directly on the border . 
  i 'm almost certain that border countries of the schengen area already get a donations to ensuring security of their borders . 
   we pay # 100 , but we expect more than 100 prescriptions for this drug wow ... now that went cheap . 
  why any doctor would go for that ? 
  it 's a silly amount of money . 
   in 2012 , gsk paid $ 3bn ( # 1.9 bn ) in the largest healthcare fraud settlement in us history after pleading guilty to promoting two drugs for unapproved uses and failing to report safety data about a diabetes drug to the food and drug administration . 
  some people never learn ... 
  nope , i did n't . 
  but you missed the point of my post . 
  `` scheduled exercises '' become a running joke on this reddit since shortly before [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zgxcr/poland_conducts_military_exercises_near_ukrainian/ ) . 
   now please , explain why would anyone downvote any of these posts ? 
  look at the context . 
  for example your first and second posts quoted came out to be completely out of context - seems like here you repeated again the same problem here that you had there . 
  you do n't look at the context , just post whatever comes up to your mind . 
  that 's why you get down-voted . 
   and as the rules say , you only downvote if you think a post does n't contribute this rule is , was , and will be bs . 
  almost noone is following it and there 's no way to enforce it . 
  people will down-vote for numerous reasons . 
  from political views , through the fact that you post something taken out of nowhere , down to the point where they strongly disagree with even part of your otherwise truthful post . 
   despite this , i will get downvoted because i went against the general circlejerkery of this subreddit . 
  then why the hell you even read it ? 
  i do n't read subreddits that are full of people i consider to be jerks ( for example : / r/worldnews ) . 
  noone is forcing me to , so it 's logical to avoid reddits i do n't like . 
  why you do n't do the same ? 
  [ i see what you did here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22rpxl/have_you_noticed_prorussian_astroturfing_in/ ) ;  [ sing along , sing along !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z4m4lnjxky ), 
  comments on onet.pl are living a legend on it 's own . 
  we call them here `` scheduled exercises '' . 
  just put / s at the end of a post ( or line ) - usually helps , 
   being down voted right away . 
  people overreact . 
  i seen it quite often that those with russian flag in their flair get down voted just for a sake of it , no matter what they post . 
  sometimes it 's totally ridiculous ( eg . 
  guy supports a post that got +30 votes and gets downvoted to hell in few minutes ), 
  well , i do read some of the mainstream media websites , and as far as blindly pro-russian comments go : they get down-voted to hell . 
  never the less - there 's more of them now than there used to be during the peak of euromaidan ( back then it was very much pro-ukrainian and anti-svoboda + anti-pravy-sektor ) . 
  let 's not go over the board with that , shall we ? 
  it 's true for mainstream media , but that 's true just as much for english-speaking mainstream media ( or any media that 's focused around certain ideology ) . 
   additionally , the so-called referendum was organized in a matter of weeks by a self-proclaimed crimean leadership that was installed by armed russian military personnel after seizing government buildings one of the things that gets forgotten most often of all in this whole crisis . 
  and thank you nato for not calling it straight off a `` referendum '' as press likes to do . 
   the court highlighted circumstances in which claims for independence would be illegal . 
  this would include if `` they were , or would have been , connected with the unlawful use of force '' . 
  an example of `` an unlawful use of force '' would be an invasion and occupation by a neighbouring country -- which is exactly what russia has done . 
  funny how just few days ago i had a discussion here with the guy who insisted that the presence of russian army on a streets of crimea does n't invalidate anything that happened there . 
  wish nato would publish that document earlier . 
  o_o drugs too much ? 
  cyprus is . 
  it 's in vast majority inhabited by europeans . 
  yea , geographically it 's not , but greeks that live there are as european as it gets . 
  georgia will probably hang in the same status as turkey does - never-ending application . 
  you mentioned  reddit has enough influence so i 'm just trying to show that reddit as such does have enough influence . 
   surveys by who ? 
  who do they ask ? 
  google , pick the survey , sources should be below , methodology on the website of agency that made the survey . 
   i 've never been asked my opinion ... let 's not go there , please . 
  last time i had an argument about `` how survey work '' and `` what is statistic '' i ended up wasting good half an hour of my life . 
  you replayed to the post :  serious question , can you give me something pro russian that is n't just propaganda ? 
  that 's why i thought you linked to something that 's pro-russian but not a propaganda . 
   these events do n't reflect the will of the people you clearly have n't see any surveys about support for either annexation of crimea or putin himself . 
  yep . 
  / r/worldnews is read by roughly 300 000 people ** every day ** . 
  that definitely qualifies as something worth their time . 
  newspapers got less reach than that subreddit . 
  and how is that exactly `` pro-russia '' ? 
  russia cutting gas for unpaid bills is suppose to be something positive ? 
  it 's rather bad news - that they did n't got money - than anything pro-russia . 
  neutral at best ( they loose money so they 're forced to do something about it ) . 
  if you 'll find something positive happening in russia - feel free to make a separate post about it . 
  but that certainly is a bad example for positive stuff going on there . 
   can you imagine someone on / r/europe condemning ukraine for doing this ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  we had plenty of people doing that on different occasions , myself included . 
  let 's be clear here : there never was any explosion , russians did not assassinate polish president , polish prime minister did not cooperate with putin to kill anyone ( no matter how many times opposition party pis will show the same [ photo ] ( http://cdn8.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/t/251119/wsieci-tusk-i-putin_17521297.jpg ) as a supposed proof of conspiracy between two leaders ) . 
  just a few days ago prosecutor 's office released official statement saying that investigation proved that there was no explosion onborad . 
  but conspiracy theorists just ca n't get over it when all of the facts confirm that nothing from these claims ever took place . 
  we 're not / r/history, 
  funny how every person that even implies usa got any control over canada automatically gets downvoted . 
  here , have an upvote for saying truth . 
  allowing eu to expand beyond europe is like opening a pandora 's box . 
  yes - canada is really nice country , and we share common values with them on pretty much every front , but the european union was created to fulfil particular role in europe , not to become a `` savour of the world '' , for that we 'd need to create some new union . 
  i do n't want to see eu become crippled like united nations is . 
  totally paralysed by the amount of countries that joined it .
