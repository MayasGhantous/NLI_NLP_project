  no need to make it only for a '' * coming coverage * '' . 
  consensus ** is ** overwhelming . 
  i like how they link wikipedia to look more convincing . 
  that 's still purely for defensive purposes . 
  funny enough - i recall some survey where poles asked if scotland should have independence were by far more supportive to this idea than any of the countries in the uk did . 
  then in some public discussions on a radio asking people why poles would want scotland to be independent and someone said that scotland is more european than the whole rest of the uk , so they should have a right to stay in the eu if uk leaves . 
   questionable assumption that anyone feels european . 
  hardly a questionable assumption considering how many people here actually do feel european . 
   tanks are for attacking no , they are not , but they can be used in that way , yes . 
  first random example - poland . 
  we have huge tank army , 5th in europe for that matter , and yet in no way they 're going to be used for any sort of attack on other nation - we got them purely for defensive purposes . 
   what we need is more planes since we only really have 1 outdated jet fighter and a bunch of soviet ww2 planes i would argue that it 's a worse investment than mbts . 
  every baltic country borders russia directly and is small enough for modern russian long range anti-air missiles to create area denial over significant part of it 's air space without crossing the border , and i doubt any of baltics or even all combined can get an air force significant enough to make a difference - while at the same time it 's very expensive to purchase and much more expensive to maintain than ivfs or mbts are . 
  modern mbts capable of urban warfare , such as leopard 2 a7 + could at least take part in some battles and inflict causalities to the enemy before being taken out by . 
  in my humble opinion what baltics could use is a higher number of modern mpads , few medium range anti-air missiles such as rapier , hidden and widespread caches of anti-tank missiles ( especially in urban areas ) , man portable uavs and as you said - hardware for soldiers . 
  also some specialized equipment could be very beneficial . 
  jamming equipment for electronic warfare , laser designators ( for nato air force to provide support ) , counter-battery radars , night vision , body armor , etc. 
  joining one of * future soldier * projects from other nato nations could also be very beneficial for the performance of your army while at the same time nowhere near as expensive as developing your own project . 
  but that 's more of a long-term perspective . 
  launching 20 icbms or one mirv missile is enough to overwhelm any shield just by a sheer chance . 
  and democratic governments will have a hard time surviving even a single hit from nuclear weapon in a large city . 
  that said though - it 's not going to happen . 
  mad makes conventional warfare by far more likely than any nuclear conflict . 
  even if us and ru tanks would be shooting each other ( which again is very unlikely to happen in a first place ) . 
   the eu started out as an economic zone these days are long gone , sir . 
  lisbon treaty was pretty much a final nail to the coffin of viewing eu as a simple * economic zone * . 
   and then on the other claims like yours that russia trying to invade a country of 5 million that they share a long border with would end in blood and misery for them gets upvoted . 
  myth of the winter war is very strong , and not to be underestimated . 
  even russians have fear , or at a very least respect to finns . 
  that 's why he gets all these upvotes . 
   finland might have reserves of 350k men , but does it have the equipment and supplies ready for them at a short notice that will have them at modern standards ( not 1939 standards with a flask of water and a bolt rifle ) ? 
  well , russians can , that 's certain . 
  something i highlight every time people underestimate russia : [ nato-russia exercise gap ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap ) . 
  that said though - finland wo n't be attacked by 3400 planes nor even majority of western military district forces . 
  any attack on finland would mean that russia needs to secure it 's borders in far east , south , and most importantly west . 
  risk of retaliation from nato would be way too high to put majority of their forces in finland . 
  no , he was n't . 
  these are two separate cases . 
  here we have air force lieutenant , previously they captured colonel working in the land forces . 
  @ part about poland  the germans really do n't like poles , and among germany 's 9 neighbors , are disliked the most . 
  with neighbors like that - it 's not surprising . 
  if poland would be in the same spot germany is - we 'd hate ourselves more than anyone else . 
    poland is considered a country of car thieves by the germans . 
  that 's so '90s . 
   poles really shore up their hatred for their eastern & southern neighbors , primarily russia and ukraine , although they do n't like czechs , slovaks or lithuanians either . 
  what ? 
  i never met a pole who would n't like czechs or slovaks . 
  ever . 
  if anything - we find them to be funny , nice people - particularly due to language which sort-of sounds like a parody of polish ( no offense meant to our czech friends , but it 's quite difficult to explain relation between our languages , and i know it does n't work in both ways ) . 
  ok , i did some research and [ here is a polish study ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2014/k_020_14.pdf ) on how we see other nations : * czechs are our favorite nation . 
  from all countries in the world . 
  * second place : italians * 3rd : slovaks . 
  * germans took 15th place with 39 % liking them , 27 % being neutral and 30 % not liking them * two neighbor countries that we dislike most are russia and ( less ) belarus . 
  ** with that research done i conclude that this article is pure bollocks . 
  **   oddly , they do n't really mind the germans , and probably still fear them a bit -- you never , ever hear jokes about germans in poland . 
  never heard of pole , rus and german jokes ? 
  these are nearly as popular as jokes about pole , czech and rus . 
  paywalled, 
  an excellent news . 
  perhaps with these numbers they wo n't achieve much , but every bit counts , even if only for morale . 
  btw : they serve in mykolaiv , [ city pointed out by ukrainian major as a potential target for future russian attack ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2z4co7/they_dont_let_us_fight_ukraine_without_commanders/ ) . 
  that should give russians a good reason to reconsider if what this major said is truth . 
  finns and their simple lives ... until recently we never really got that comfort : /, 
  this :  all what middle class means is that it 's between working class and upper class . 
  it got nothing to deal with having a good life . 
  is an important part . 
  what you quoted is just an anecdote . 
   do n't you dare tell me that people in poverty are generally happier . 
  i never said anything like that . 
  you are reading something from my posts that i never wrote . 
  define `` many '' . 
  i would say - enough do to recruit them as a spies or at least : collaborators . 
  it 's partially a fault of the sentiments towards `` the days when they were young '' , partially fault of the education system which says barely anything about the post-war events . 
  anti-american ( xxi century ) and anti-german ( xx century ) propaganda also took it 's toll in convincing some people that poland should stay neutral between us and ru interests ( so some people harm poland in some imaginary view that it helps restoring balance to the west-centric politics ) . 
  in either case - it 's a margin of society . 
  spies are in every country and they do it for various reasons . 
  sometimes it 's belief , sometimes it 's money , sometimes it 's revenge . 
   not much better in finland i 'd assume . 
  finland military is actually build around ~ ~ guerrilla ~ ~ mobile warfare with plenty of hidden caches and infrastructure build over decades for nothing else than fighting overwhelming soviet , and later russian forces . 
  assuming simultaneous attack on both countries finland will be by far harder pill to swallow than poland in first several months , until polish resistance would start delivering large quantities of weapons , especially missiles . 
  then a simple numerical advantage would lead to higher causalities in poland , that 's obvious , but finns really should n't be underestimated . 
  they are better prepared for prolonged war with russia than poland is . 
  well ... at least we have nato . 
  you guys will need another simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 ... 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bmpt_terminator ) - the only operator of this vehicle is ... kazakhstan . 
  russia is ** not ** using it . 
  it 's basically a tank - just replacing main gun with multiple smaller weapon systems . 
  * somewhat comparable * vehicles : [ cv-90 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combat_vehicle_90 ) , [ type-89 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitsubishi_type_89_ifv ) , [ dardo ifv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dardo_ifv ) , [ abhay ifv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abhay_ifv ) - all of them though are cheaper , more mobile and lighter . 
  armata was supposed to have a first official presentation on 9th of may , however it looks like russian mod opted instead for modernized t-72 up to b3 standard for deployment in the east . 
  this new variant was supposed to modernize t-72s `` up to t-90a standards '' however in reality t-72b3 in many ways is inferior to t-90s , most notable issues of t-72b3 currently in operation by russian federation include lack of satellite navigation or automatic target tracking systems . 
  what russia operates is worse than the export variants of the same model which do feature both systems . 
  if armata will in deed hit the production lines - it will be the first new russian tank design since 80s . 
  the * famous * t-90 is in fact a modernization of t-72b . 
  still though i doubt armata will be ready for production in next few years . 
  sanctions are a huge setback for russian capabilities in developing/stealing new technologies and so far all that russians shown were 3d renders . 
  armata looks to be in earlier stages of development than so laughed on the internet obrum/bae [ pl-01 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl-01 ) , at the same time being more complicated and expensive vehicle . 
  cause they do n't fit the narration of showing how australia is supposedly bigger than europe . 
  fyi , to whomever made this map : area of europe is 10.18 million km \u00b2 , area of australia is 7.692 million km \u00b2 . 
  / eot, 
  just that whiner is unhappy - it does n't invalidate him being in a middle class or whatnot .
