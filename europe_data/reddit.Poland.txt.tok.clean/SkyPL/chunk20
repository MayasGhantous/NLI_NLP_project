  european union constitution says :  the union shall be open to all ** european ** states which respect its values and are committed to promoting them together . 
  canada is not an european state . 
  technically it 's always been partially european partially asian . 
  first settlements on cyprus were made by greeks ( europe ) and phoenicians ( asia ) , it kept on switching hands numerous times through the history , belonging to the powers from europe or asia . 
  right now it 's inhabited mostly by greek cypriots , which are europeans . 
   i 'm not a fan of keeping a particular group out of something just because they 're not already part of our group . 
  ** european ** union is european because it 's in europe . 
  feel free to make a new union that would combine countries across different continents . 
  perhaps there is a need for it , sure , but i do n't see any desire to make it . 
  hold your horses cowboy !, 
  never said that they 're reborn angels . 
  just hearing something positive about right sector must be a pain for russians who see everything in black & white terms , and that almost certainly will spawn some silly twist by rt or other kremlin-controlled media . 
  bad idea . 
  canada is not europe . 
  eu should stay european . 
  interesting how there 's a stripe spanning from central germany to northern poland . 
  one from a cold war , obviously . 
  ca n't wait to see the response from kremlin propaganda . 
  us trade representatives have something against eu dodging nsa ? 
  who would have thought ? 
   different name , same difference ? 
  nope  sure there 'll be a bit of hostility in the beginning but i 'm sure that 'll subside and pragmatism will win yea , only the pragmatism might be in this case to teach other eu countries a lesson that you ca n't just hop in and out of eu at will without consequences . 
  turkey is just in a customs union , not in a single market . 
  whatever uk will be allowed to get into the single market without any obstacles is yet to be seen , just like it 's yet to be seen if uk votes against eu and then again if uk will leave eu . 
  yea , law changed since then . 
   i am quite happy for banks and financial institutions to have plenty of freedom so long as if they fail then they are n't bailed out . 
  the problem at the moment is that the sector is too large in the uk and so if large numbers of banks fail they have to be bailed out . 
  that bail out wo n't be sponsored by british government alone . 
  in current polices an entire eu will pay for bailouts ( germany will have a largest share in that ) . 
  if uk is out of eu - you 're on your own with bailouts . 
  noone in eu is going to send you even one euro to handle that . 
  and seeing current attitude i very much doubt british government will ever pass any law that does anything to the bail outs . 
   it 's clear as daylight that britain in general and the city especially benefit a lot from eu membership . 
  obviously not for the brits . 
  they think that whatever britain benefits from eu is outweighed by their annual contribution to the eu budget and `` limiting '' laws `` imposed '' by * evil * brussels . 
  banks working in uk and doing stuff to money of british citizens will still operate in uk . 
  banks that operate in an entire eu will move their hqs away - yes - but the only `` power '' that they 'll loose over uk is their power to employ british citizens . 
  in response to shrinking employment it seems like british government will enable laws that give even more power to the banks that decided to stay there ( hoping to encourage more to stay / return back ) and that means you 're fucked up even more than now . 
  as i said - eu is the one that limits power of banks - british government is the one getting into their asses . 
  you need to read the article , it says something quite opposite . 
  eu is the one that imposes limits on banking sector and uk is the one suing them over and over again for doing that . 
  plus :  `` i think we had a compensation plan that shareholders liked , '' gulliver said . 
  `` sadly , because of the eu directive , we 've had to change . '' oh , so sad ... 
   if britain votes to quit the eu , sherwood says , parts of london 's banking business would inevitably drift to frankfurt and paris . 
  yep , and it wo n't be just banks doing that . 
   for the numbers to actually be comparable , you would have to exclude anyone not in the workforce - in which case you would get a much higher return on investment on a danish worker vs anyone else ( since , on average , a danish worker pulls down a higher wage and as such also contributes with a higher taxable income ) . 
  it 's more complex than that . 
  taxation does n't change - company has higher profits thanks to lower costs , so it can invest more in development or hire more people - all of which are taxed . 
  immigrant employees do n't affect income of a country . 
  if anything - they do it on a positive side - immigrants on average are younger and healthier male employees , which means less time spent on a sick leave , less time spent on maternity leave , and no costs for future pension ( vast majority of immigrants do n't work long enough in the country to earn the right for pension , so they basically pay for your parents or grandparents while your children will never pay for them ) . 
  there 's of course many more factors to that , but you get the picture . 
   is that for a foreign worker to actually contribute , they would have to be doing a job that did n't exist prior to them taking it put it in a different way - what if they 're doing a job that could be kept only because of lower costs ? 
   otherwise their contribution has to be subtracted the welfare cost of the worker they displaced . 
  that assumes worker will be unemployed for a whole duration of them being hired . 
  in a country-wide statistic it 'd mean that the raise of immigration is directly proportional to the raise in unemployment rate among danes . 
  and there is no such relation in any country that got immigrant workers . 
   danish unions have already criticised the report . 
  of course they did !, 
  lol . 
  what did you expect them to do ? 
   whats the point though ? 
  people get paid for that . 
   reddit is just a site , [ over 300 000 views per day ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/about/traffic/ ) certainly does n't make it `` just a site '' .

  sounds okish . 
  obviously it 's suppose to work as deterrent . 
  this + the fact that anti-terrorists actually start to capture people might really discourage local revolts and make it much more difficult for russia to gain territories through the revolts - which is what the ukrainian parliament tries to achieve . 
  it 's still a very , very modest law comparing the ** [ the one in russia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2180vf/russia_3_years_in_jail_for_calling_to_return/ ) ** . 
  ukrainian law still allows you to come out on a street and speak of your mind . 
  in russia you ca n't even do that . 
  [ they do much more than that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegal_immigration_to_the_united_states ), 
   wasting money on increased barriers is n't going to do shit . 
  wasting money on keeping people in refugee camps is n't doing a shit either . 
  something really needs to be done about it , regardless which way it is decided to be . 
  personally i 'd be extra-careful with scenario like the one you proposed - it 's only more encouraging then then what we have right now . 
  and that means more deaths of innocent people , and more broken law , and more smugglers living their life ( indirectly ) off the eu money . 
  equally well we could open the borders completely and let everyone come in . 
  is n't it the same what people on a border of us and mexico used to say before us actually started to do something about illegal immigrants ? 
  ca n't we take a lessons from us ? 
  i mean : they have a very efficient system of handling illegal immigrants , do n't they ? 
   but most of that is my 10 trolls that stalk me everywhere . 
  they need a hobby . 
  oh yea , hate ppl like that . 
  frustrating as hell . 
  by ethics - they 're very very rarely , but still does n't change the fact that getting into europe through human traffickers is illegal . 
  there are legal ways to get into europe , and it 's easier than legally getting into us . 
  illegal immigrants = = law breakers . 
  nah , people usually down-vote stuff for a reason , only sometimes it 's impossible to guess what that reason might have been ( i seen almost everything during my short stay on reddit - including people down-voting for typos ) , here very often it 's due to political views . 
  i see you 've managed to collect minus 868 votes across reddit - quite an impressive result , so i can see why you might be a bit frustrated . 
  perhaps try to look for a different reddit , one that 's closer to your point of view ? 
  there 's so many of them that it should be possible to find one . 
   i ca n't make any recommendations though , cause i 'm relatively new reddit member ( registered bit over year ago , but started using it roughly month ago ) . 
  well , i 'll give it a try then , and read through all of it . 
  you got me more interested . 
  i 'm most curious how did he managed to dodge the eu laws while being in efta at the same time . 
  this would be quite unique , as noone have done that yet . 
  will be an interesting read , hopefully . 
   maybe some of you could just read instead of vote .
