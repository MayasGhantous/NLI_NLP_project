  yea , had a laugh there . 
  read the top one and just kept on going to the end . 
  silly people . 
  they 're more afraid of what would happen if these people get in power than a physical attacks . 
   main fears :  european and american politicians -- 37.9 % i 'm not sure if people in eu asked about the same would n't end up with even higher percentage ... 
  there are so many crazy politicians that there 's always someone to fear there . 
  88 % said yes ?!, 
  wow ... 
  i 'm amazed . 
  i expected some support , but 88 % is really astonishing result . 
  yea , politicians still most likely wo n't give a shit , but never the less - impressive unity on that topic from danes . 
  link from the post does n't work any more . 
  here 's a corrected one : http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/brexit%20entry%20170_final_bio_web.pdf, 
   yes , he outlines what would be ideal , is he ? 
  header of the table states :  box 2 : comparative positions of norway , switzerland and turkey and proposed uk position after exit as far as i see - that 's his proposed scenario of the uk exit from eu , not a starting scenario to step back from . 
   for example not contributing to the eu budget , he points out that this would almost certainly be impossible . 
  the only quote i read about that is :  it would be worth agreeing to one-off or time-limited measures , such as continuing to pay the uk 's eu budget contributions ** to the end of this budget period ** which is quite contrary to what you said . 
  but i did n't have time to read an entire document , so feel free to throw in an appropriate quote to support your statement . 
   -- besides - that also makes me curious , if in deed guy is saying that contributions can not be avoided - then what 's the point ? 
  is n't the whole thing about uk leaving eu out there ** because ** uk is a net contributor ? 
  ( well , this and the fact that they do n't like immigrants from eu while they do like immigrants from commonwealth ) what 's the point of leaving eu if they 'll still have to keep most of their law in line with eu ( to stay in efta ) and they 'll still have to contribute money , while at the same time having no say in eu law making process and having no share in eu expenses ( in 2012 uk received [ 6.933 m ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) euro ) ? 
  good luck to them . 
  this is probably the most important news for ukraine in last few weeks . 
  i 'm glad to see eu acting , and trying to actively help ukraine beyond short-term perspective of a current crisis . 
  trees grow in a same spot + buildings stand in the same spot = `` little has changed '' . 
  let me quote one of the commentators there :  only an american could come up with that title . 
  these are politics . 
  experts in politics will say whatever those paying them want to hear . 
  so we have `` experts '' saying everything - from total isolation of uk from continental europe to , basically , '' * have everything , but do n't pay your contribution * '' . 
   and there 's nothing wrong with cherrypicking . 
  yea , very dominant point of view in british discuss on a topic . 
  yep . 
  all the money spent on these people should be instead spend on sending them , the illegal immigrants , back + sponsoring a prison somewhere in africa for these :  there are people smugglers , merchants of death , earning and profiting from human beings , from the death of other men the fact that we allow illegal immigrants to stay is basically sponsoring human traffickers . 
  that 's the most shameful thing that happens in the eu right now . 
   estimates can vary depending on who 's making them . 
  that 's the same with every single estimation , including the one for uk . 
  we had the same thing in poland . 
  in my city you could win a car by filling in annual tax declaration ( which is mandatory anyway - lol ) . 
  [ reminded me of this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nawe7xk5e4a ), 
   who the fuck thought ukraine was in the us ? 
  remember : 10 % of every society is made of idiots . 
   the event was organized by ruch narodowy , or national movement , a polish organization that opposes foreign influences , views homosexuality as an illness and believes poland is threatened by a leftist revolution hatched in brussels . 
  worth to add : their support is around 1 % in election polls . 
  yep . 
  still cherry picking . 
  scroll to page 10 - they pretty much want all the benefits switzerland has ( minus few that they do n't like ( notably : free movement of people ) or do n't care about ) without contributing the the eu budget like switzerland does . 
  i ca n't see how anyone in the eu would be stupid enough to agree on that . 
  authors of this document live in a fairytale . 
  and the other half lives in a countries that are not a federations . 
  at the same time none of these federations formed from something identical to the european union , so they 're hardly relevant to the situation in europe . 
  but as i said - i do n't expect understanding it , just face the reality : there are alternatives , none of which leads to a certain collapse as you think . 
  i guess we 're lucky enough to open our eyes and see many different options in between . 
  i 'm not discussing merits of these different alternatives , i do n't feel qualified enough to start any constructive discussion , as i 'm not a supporter of either of them . 
  if you want to convince someone about invalidity of them - go , find a supporters of them . 
   i 'm not thinking in silly absolutes , yes you are . 
  collapse or `` pick what i think is best '' are absolutes . 
   a pure confederation , which is pretty much what the eu system is now has never been tried at the scale of what 400 million people ? 
   ( ... )  the eu is not some special fairytale land where humans act differently from everyone else on the planet . 
  obviously it must be when it survived pretty much a lifetime without a collapse , and actually - it seems like it 'll keep on going quite nicely without switching to federation next year or so . 
  there are many ways to address issues eu is facing right now - that 's what politicians are discussing in recent months , but be assured that none of these solutions involve turning eu into a federation . 
  as i already said : stop thinking about eu in a context of usa and events that happened during your unification . 
  they got exactly nothing do deal with situation in europe . 
  i doubt you 'll ever be able to understand it , and there 's nothing wrong with that , just accept the reality that alternatives are discussed , they are on a table , and federalization is n't going to happen in next 10 years - it 's not even sure if it 'll happen at all . 
  we 're much more flexible than jumping into one box or another . 
  just for an example , even current eu is n't a pure confederation - it 's more of a mix between confederation , federation , and an economical alliance . 
  and that 's where eu is headed right now : mix of three forms . 
  whatever it 'll turn into pure federation is very doubtful looking at the current trends . 
  but at the same time it 's nearly certain that it will survive just fine . 
  eu is not us . 
  never was , never will be . 
  scenarios that worked in us got nothing to deal with european reality . 
  now , do n't feel offended , but you ca n't understand it simply because culture of american states is silly-short comparing to the culture europeans have . 
  and that 's very much tied with their national identity . 
   sure , there are completely untested alternatives that europeans eu ** is ** something that 's completely untested right now . 
  it does n't get any more untested than what we have . 
   i do n't accept any alternative future for the eu , you are free man , you can think as you please . 
  does n't change the fact that there are alternatives , including even deeper integration ( into one super-state ) than these proposed by supporters of federation . 
   no sane person should please , do n't use * ad personum * insults to a large part of eu population . 
  you see - support for federalization is still relatively weak . 
  and there are many reasons for that - most of which are totally alien to americans , mostly because the path you took while transforming individual states into single federalized country . 
   eu ca n't hold it all together , it will simply fall apart again . 
  so far eu is , was , and in foreseeable future : will be holding it together without federalization . 
  stop working in absolutes . 
  nothing will collapse if eu wo n't turn into federation . 
  yes , it 'll be much weaker entity , but catastrophic scenarios you try to draw are silly . 
  eu would collapse only if people would try to implement federation right away . 
  eu citizens are very tied to their national and centuries long cultural identity - and that right now is on a raise , not fall ( just look at the results of most recent elections - in hungary ) . 
  federalization would mean nations stepping back to a degree , and that will meet a lot of resistance . 
  it already does , that 's why parties like british ukip gain so much support . 
  ^ ( each time someone compares angela merkel to the * empress of europe * ukip and similar parties gain one additional supporter , hehe ) what people in eu need right now is a lot of education and agreeing that working for a good of eu means working for their own good , and achievements of eu are as much of their own achievements as they are for everyone else in it . 
  cause you see - the identity of european union citizen is something that pretty much does n't exist in a mind of average citizen within eu countries . 
  and without that - any attempts of federalization will end up as a complete failure . 
  so please , do n't say that `` eu will either go federal or go back to warring with each other '' - it 's bs that got nothing to deal with reality . 
  there are many , many alternatives , all of which include keeping eu and pax europa only in different forms and with different jurisdiction . 
  noone will `` back to warring with each other '' just because there wo n't be a federation . 
  it 's completely detached from reality . 
   i completely disagree , if the eu ca n't even make it to the point of being a united federation , it will collapse . 
  you disagree with what ? 
  the fact that there are other scenarios than federation ? 
  seriously ?
