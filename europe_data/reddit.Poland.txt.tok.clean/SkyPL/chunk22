  we have this discussion in eu - about what will lay ahead and whatever it 'll be federalization or not - for last few years . 
  do n't show typical american ignorance . 
  eu wo n't be doomed if it wo n't change into a federation - there are many alternative scenarios , like a deeply integrated confederation , forming an unitary state ( basically : goes even further than a federation ) , or pursuing only economical union , while in every other respect remaining as they are today . 
  and that 's just a beginning - there are many more ideas that take bits from a different types of governments . 
  eu is not usa . 
  scenarios from us wo n't work in eu . 
  stop thinking in silly absolutes . 
  let 's not be so ignorant please . 
  [ google shall give you many more alternative scenarios ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=future+of+eu ) . 
  now that 's something !, 
   these states were the equivalent of european countries . 
  so were parts of the germany . 
  and to make it more funny : germany unified later on than usa did . 
  and some of them are more powerful than some of the states in usa . 
  you want to try china than ? 
  a rising superpower ? 
  or russia - a former superpower ? 
  i 'm 100 % certain i would n't be able to locate all of the european nations . 
  i 'm not even sure if i heard about all of them in a first place i doubt there 's a single person on this reddit that could list all of the european nations from a memory , yet alone locate them . 
  again : * nations \u2260 countries * administrative division of a country \u2260 countries, 
  yep . 
  you still keep on going offtopic . 
  we 're not discussing an impact on legislation . 
  we talking about percentage of laws that came from brussels . 
  these two are linked ( number of laws that come directly from eu is just a part of overall impact eu has on a legislation ) , and impact of legislation is more important for the author of this article , but it changes exactly nothing to the fact that '' \u201975 percent to 80 percent of laws are made by eu institutions '' is complete bs with number taken out of nowhere . 
  will be or wo n't be . 
  nothing is certain yet . 
  eu will evolve , but there are many different paths than federalization . 
  us might collapse at some point in future . 
  it does n't change a thing . 
   none of the europeans ones . 
  sure you can . 
  just think about it . 
  ... ok , so here is one : scotland . 
  yes , it 's not labelled `` state '' but it is a part of an administrative division of an european country . 
  and i 'm certain you 'd list quite a few more after thinking about it , 
  already posted : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22ijgp/the_polish_soldier_who_snuck_into_auschwitz/, 
  `` true impact '' is an extremely subjective term . 
  i just called on what the lady said . 
  it was n't truth , and , from purely objective statistic - it 's not . 
  i think you imagined that i 'm arguing about something i never even mentioned . 
  if not - please , show your numbers . 
   the difference being that each state was , in the past , the equivalent of a member of the european union that past was long before i was born , or even : before my grand-grand mother was born . 
  germany was also made of small countries that later unified into one very long ago . 
  i do n't care to know where each one of them is either . 
  unification of usa into a single country : 1788 unification of germany into a single county : 1871 ( and than again in 1990 but that 's irrelevant to this example ) so you see - last time germany was made of separate countries happened to be much later than when usa was yet noone is asking me about the location of bavaria . 
   so when people are telling me `` fuck man , americas are retarded they ca n't name loads of the states in europe '' , well , neither can we do the same for them . 
  there is no relation between these two situations . 
  * in one you have administrative division of a single country . 
  * in the other one you have different countries . 
  these are vastly different . 
  each one ? 
  certainly not . 
  i also would n't be able to pinpoint all lands in germany , or oblasts and republics in russian federation . 
  still though i would be able to show at least 5 of them , which is more than i would in russia or germany - quite impressive considering that poland neighbours with both of these countries and i never even been in us . 
   does the eu have the natural resources ? 
  yep . 
  quite a lot of them . 
  right now coal , and north sea gas ( + to a degree crude oil ) are most widely used eu resources in energy production . 
  eu also mines uranium but it 's barely anything to satisfy the needs ( only 3 % of eu needs are satisfied by mining within it 's territory ) . 
  in longer perspective shale gas will play an important role . 
   what are the potential difficulties ? 
  costs . 
  that 's the major real obstacle right now . 
  eu could supply itself with energy from renewables , nuclear and coal powerplants in 100 % . 
  but we 're very much dependent on gas because it 's cheap and there 's plenty of infrastructure ready for it . 
  then there 's politics , especially the fact that corporations like gazprom have relatively strong lobby everywhere around eu . 
  in a very long term perspective there 's also [ iter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iter ) and [ thorium reactors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thorium_fuel_cycle ) but for now the will to develop these projects is rather underwhelming ( there 's pretty much nothing done about thorium and iter is suffering from constant delays and whatever technology will be developed into anything more serious is still under a question mark ), 
  duplicate : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22i1r2/eu_top_court_rules_eu_data_retention_law_invalid/, 
   reverse flows technically possible afaik it already happened during last crisis . 
  germany pumped gas to ukraine . 
  so it 's not just theoretical possibility . 
   gazprom has raised legal doubts over reverse flows did n't gazprom said that it 's straight on illegal because contracts they signed forbid resale ? 
  i seen one of the gazprom representatives saying something along these lines in the news . 
  yep . 
  i agree with pretty much everything said in that quote . 
  if you are trying to make a counter-argument to what i said there i must be missing it . 
  source ? 
  everyone are better in that . 
  lol, 
  hopefully in a from that respects private life . 
  most of the plugs from that wikipedia page are cross-compatybile amd some features are purely optional . 
  sir , you made an intelligent answer to a troll post . 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  `` a bit '' - i see what you did here !, 
  tv translation time !, 
  yea , this article is ful of bollocks . 
  the fact that words translate differently depending on a context ( one word has multiple meanings ) or that sometimes one word gets translated into two ( or more ) is rather common , regardless of the combination of languages . 
  if you have sleed = \u015bnieg z deszczem then you also have prze\u015bcierad\u0142o = bed sheet . 
  and 3 summers ago could be translated either to `` 3 pory letnie temu '' or in more casual way `` latem 3 lata temu '' ( that might vary depending on a context ) , but in general sense `` 3 lata temu '' is an aceptable translation , as whatever you meant `` summers '' or `` years '' will come out from context . 
  just like `` czy widzisz ten d\u017awig '' translated to `` do you see that crane '' is meaningless without a context for english-speaking person ( is it a bird i 'm looking at , or not ? ), 
  `` the '' is something that most of the european languages do n't have . 
  you sir , just won all of the arguments in that topic !, 
  hehe  fair enough  we 're getting into way too subjective topics to argue about them , 
  all what i claimed is under links provided . 
  you just need to read it . 
   she says at least 75 % of all eu countries laws come from brussels . 
  i dare to call that bs . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.jcm.org.uk/blog/2009/06/what-percentage-of-laws-come-from-the-eu/ )  the house of commons library has published a new , much more comprehensive study of the percentage of uk laws that originate from the eu . 
  it is freely available as a pdf and despite running to 59 pages i 'd strongly recommend reading it in full .
