   its conclusion ? 
  ** the true figure is around 15 % . 
  **  update , june 2012 : a new german study has revisited this topic , focusing on germany , the uk , denmark , france , austria and finland . 
  its conclusions can be found in more detail here . 
  short version :  * uk -- 15.5 %  * denmark -- 14 %  * austria -- 10.6 %  * france -- between 3 % and 26 %  * finland -- between 1 and 24 %  * germany -- 39.1 %, 
   basically , there are perfectly good reasons why a married man with kids who suddenly feels attraction to men man or woman - does n't matter . 
  point still stands . 
   on the other hand , traditionally oppressed minorities tend to get very , very offended at anything that suggests that they may be inferior . 
  yep . 
  good point . 
  but we ca n't allow one minority ( people who have problems with handling their emotional part of life ) to suffer because the other minority demands more `` comfort '' . 
  cause as far as i 'm concerned - that 's what it is - make them feel more comfortable that there is noone trying to help people resist `` temptation '' . 
   and i do n't know why , but gays are often more sensitive than other oppressed minorities ( say racial minorities ) , about this equality or inequality of value thing . 
  well , i 'm afraid we wo n't find out , cause as soon as someone would want to make a study on that - he would be labelled as a homophobe and could forget about his future career . 
   then again , lifestyle in a small uk town is not that interesting either . 
  still nicer than in a city of equal size in poland  but still , generally they are more suitable for people who like to stay home and tend to their garden . 
  you see - brits can relax , stay at home , tend their garden . 
  poles living in such a small city are busy worrying if they 'll have a job in next year and whatever they got enough money till 1st of next month . 
   how strong is their influence in poland ? 
  i would say : between marginal and non-existent . 
   i have mosly heard westerners talk about asia and africa in such a general context . 
  that 's because you spend most of the time listening to westerners . 
  i heard asians using this logic just as i heard `` westerners '' using it . 
   except with very broad strokes , like `` same-sex marriage is making significant headway in europe . '', 
  not really a good example . 
  in most it does , in some parts it does n't ( notably : russia ) . 
   but asia is far more diverse , and so is africa . 
  i 'd argue with that ( especially the `` far '' part ) . 
   the eu is such a ubiquitous term , you no longer have to label anything european union anyway . 
  the chart could say `` map of national hdi indexes in the eu '' as opposed to `` in europe '' if they are not going to include switzerland , norway or many eastern nations . 
  are you seriously backing your argumentation on some labels incorrectly put under some statistics i 've never seen ? 
  as if it 'd be the first or last case when statistics are incorrectly labelled . 
  there is no reason to pull out any far-going reasoning out of that . 
  [ compare uk to pl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_freedom_day ), 
   so basically your reply to someone asking for sources is twitter , a wikipedia post that proves nothing of what you said , reading helps , not just browsing through headers . 
  read the events that happened during anschluss , then compare it with the events during crimean crisis . 
  twitter posts were there to just make it a bit easier in case you would be too lazy to think about it , but seems like even that did n't help . 
   utterly incapable of backing up any of his own statements with actual sources or facts comment left under the post full of links to various sources . 
  ridiculous . 
  yep . 
  knowing basics of english certainly makes it much easier . 
  other than that - low taxes , very good social care ( poles are very much family-oriented , so that 's important for them ) , cultural influence ( britain feels much less `` alien '' than france ) , and the fact that there are so many immigrants already in place ( at the beginning these were mostly ww2-era and people who escaped from communism , now it 's younger immigrants who pull in their friends or families ) . 
   i do n't know anything about poland but lifestyle in budapest , hungary is pretty swell as long as you can pay for it . 
  well then , you pretty much nailed situation in poland ( only in warsaw it 's actually not bad - it 's much harder in small cities , like suwa\u0142ki ) . 
   why does n't he just speak to polish people who are raising their families here and have gone native ? 
  cause they 'd laugh him in the face . 
   # 100 a week wtf ? 
  why he would do that ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  i doubt there are many poles getting such a low payment . 
  especially in london . 
  `` our '' = british . 
  you might want to edit your title . 
   again , citation required . 
  [ ca n't use google ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=osce+not+allowed+in+crimea )   ex-president was kicked out of his party  definitely going to need a citation on that . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=yanukovych+out+of+it's+party )  inevitable comparison to hitler 's anschluss thrown in for good measure . 
  all without producing a single source to back it all up . 
  [ that and more ] ( http://twitchy.com/2014/03/19/washington-post-writer-finds-similarities-between-putins-words-and-hitlers/ ) , or just [ have a wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anschluss ) - similarities are obvious . 
  i refused to be [ trolled ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/troll_%28internet%29 ) any more . 
  we already have a post about that : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22ez51/next_crimea_local_legislators_in_donetsk_declare/, 
  very good points . 
  i linked to itar-tass cause they were the first news agency to publish this information . 
   more companies of the sector flocking to europe . 
  i approve . 
  and it seems like eu too sees that as an opportunity - with all the legislation passed that supposedly defends independence of the internet . 
  i personally ca n't wait to see some of the 3rd world countries grow up as an it power hosting servers `` free '' of western jurisdiction . 
  usa opposes everything that 's not usa-centric by default . 
  nope . 
  in may there will be both : presidential and local elections . 
  parliamentary elections will be in october . 
   and one month for a referendum is apparently far too quick , but 3 months for a presidential election is fine ? 
  yes , cause presidents are elected regularly every 4 years . 
  you do n't divide country every 4 years . 
  there 's a huge difference in a significance of these events . 
   i would not say it is exclusively americans though . 
  many europeans will talk about policies in `` europe '' or the difference between the us and `` europe '' . 
  depends on a context . 
  in the same one you could see asians talking about asia , or africans talking about africa . 
   you will see many charts and figures labeled `` european '' or `` in europe '' when they only include eu members . 
  european unionian sounds weird . 
   one interesting difference between this and crimea is , so far , that in crimea russia tried to keep up appearances of a legal process . 
  obviously they did n't convince majority of the world , not even china , so this time they want to cut it short . 
  but to a degree they still try to make it look like a legit process - there is `` referendum '' , there are `` local legislators '' , there are people making speeches under donetsk coat of arms , etc. 
   citation required . 
  the osce did try to send observers monitoring the military situation , but as far as i know none were sent to monitor the referendum or any other democratic matter , as my earlier source documented . 
  again : they ** did ** send observers documenting any potential breaches in democratic standards - which is what you asked about . 
  they were refused to perform their duty . 
  yes , it was n't during referendum . 
   seperate election for an independent government , so irrelevant . 
  everything that 's in line with your point of view is relevant , everything that 's not is n't . 
  you 've got to be fucking kidding me . 
   not really , given the armed mob outside the kiev parliament and the fact that of the 449 members of the kiev parliament , a mere 328 were present ex-president was kicked out of his party during it 's own country-wide congress where there was no maidan protesters outside . 
   i 'm willing to bet a lot of money that of the 121 mps not present that day , the vast majority belonged to the party of regions ( 127 seats total ) . 
  it was n't a vote made through mps but rather an internal vote of a party members . 
  like in every other democratic country parliament does n't have a power to kick out people from an independent party . 
   do you have a list of who was present and who was n't during that vote ? 
  do you have a list of all the people that voted in crimean referendum ? 
   country-wide does n't matter , really ?
