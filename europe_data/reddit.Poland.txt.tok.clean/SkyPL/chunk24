  you did it again ? 
  really ? 
   not hypocrisy , merely irrelevance . 
  that makes it 3 times . 
   prove its relevance . 
  hands down i do n't know what to say . 
  it 's like you 're arguing that 2 +2 <  4 and i 'm suppose to prove you it is equal to 4 . 
  countries interested in an annexation of a territory never ever can have any of their troops deployed on it during the voting process , period . 
  and that 's why presence of international troops in afghanistan is vastly different from a presence of russian troops in crimea . 
   invocation of godwin wtf ? 
   here 's where you once again conveniently ignore some facts . 
  the referendum allowed crimea to choose between russian annexation and a return to the 1992 constitution . 
  this is in effect the constitution that the crimeans repeatedly voted for in the early 90 's , but was suspended by force by the kiev government in 1995 . 
  i 'm very well aware of the situation . 
  it changes exactly nothing . 
  people were n't given a fair choice . 
  it was either join russia now or become independent - and that means that crimean parliament controlled by russian citizen from a russian unity party could vote it 's own annexation into russia any time . 
  there was no option to vote for current status of crimea . 
  also one more fact you very conveniently ignored about constitution from 1992 :  in june 1992 the parties reached a ** compromise ** and crimea was given the status of ** `` autonomous republic '' ** . 
  then they broke earlier compromise :  in may 1994 , the crimean parliament voted to restore the may 1992 constitution . 
  and in a response ukrainian parliament abolished the 1992 constitution within it 's own jurisdiction . 
  in 1994 ukrainian parliament was ruled by communists of ukraine which obviously you consider a pro-russian party . 
  so look !, 
  pro-russians were against crimean constitution !, 
  that 's the whole story that you so conveniently try to twist into your own point of view painting a picture of an * evil * kiev parliament . 
   such polls were done before the euromaidan coup , back when crimea still had legal representation in the kiev government . 
  that 's why their organizing national elections in may . 
  only they want to do them in as democratic way as possible , with an opportunity for everyone to have a campaign beforehand and without asking any foreign military powers to send their forces in ukraine . 
   and to any objective person reading this those reasons are nothing more than petty excuses . 
  the very same arguments could have been made when kosovo declared its independence , yet back then the osce was more than eager to send in observers . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22ez51/next_crimea_local_legislators_in_donetsk_declare/cgm5z1q + google : differences between crimea and kosovo . 
  there are dozens . 
  all of which combined give you a picture why osce agreed to send observers there and they did not to send them in crimea . 
  ( and what 's your source to justify usage of word `` eager '' anyway ? ), 
   which to me seems like even more reason to send in people documenting any potential breaches in democratic standards . 
  but they ** did send observers for that ** . 
  and they were forced out of the crimea by russian forces !, 
   typical propaganda obfuscation of truth . 
  of the 100 elected members of the crimean parliament democratically elected in 2010 , 92 belong to outspoken pro-russian parties . . 
  the current prime minister belongs to the third-largest pro-russian party in the parliament . 
  what you are saying is an obfuscation of truth . 
  party of regions was a country-wide winner , the same party that expelled former ukrainian president and the same party that still has a majority in kiev . 
  qurultai-rukh is clearly anti-russian party . 
  soyuz pro-communist party , they never went to elections with any `` reunion with russia '' headlines . 
  russian unity is a new party that never had any chances for large support , regardless who won country-wide elections . 
  people are not stupid , they wo n't vote on a party led by russian ex-mafia leader . 
   irrelevant and you 're the one accusing me for * conveniently * leaving facts out of narrative ? 
  typical hypocrisy . 
  it 's a critical issue that basically makes or breaks the whole thing . 
  that 's how you recognize democratic standards from authoritarian standards . 
  last famous example of referendum in very similar situation was anschluss of austria when german troops came with arms before the referendum and were present through the voting . 
  only hitler allowed people to choose * status quo * in anschluss referendum - while the one on crimea was only `` yes for independence '' or `` yes for joining russia '' with no option to tick for current status . 
   look at recent opinion poll , page 37 for example . 
  similar polls were done in crimea with similar results ( support to join russia never exceeded 50 % , not even during georgia-russia war ) . 
  i would n't use that as an argument in light of recent events ... 
   the whole point of observers is to tell the world whether the referendum was fair and democratic or not it was not for the reasons listed in the article you linked to . 
  it can be objectively judged that democratic standards were infringed even solely by time schedule of the referendum and all the events around it ( like putting leader of party with 4 % support as a prime minister ) . 
   no recent election held in iraq or afghanistan would be fair and democratic either none of the parties holding their military forces in iraq or afghanistan ever wanted to annex even 1 sq meter from it 's territory . 
  also [ un has it 's own mission there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_assistance_mission_in_iraq ) . 
  your comparison is ridiculous . 
   the only reason i can see not to send in observers is because you know the democratic outcome of the referendum would not be in your favo think for a little longer than half a second . 
  get your info from different sources than just rt. 
   as long as the referendum is a fair and legitimate voice of the peoples then i have no problem with it you did n't read the important part :  referendum no later than 11 may . 
  that pretty much eliminates any possibility of a fair referendum . 
  you do n't do referendums on things like that in a month . 
  such things should take years with a proper public debate and everyone given a fair chance to express their opinions as well as having a time to think about it . 
  there also should n't be an external pressure to make a decision like the one from russia right now . 
  observers are not enough . 
  even an extremely controversial independence of kosovo took 12 years of pursuit in various forms to become reality . 
  not 34 days . 
  never implied anything alike . 
  just stating facts . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hjg9z/photo_gallery_atlas_of_prejudices/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21s0v9/atlas_of_prejudice/ + several more that got deleted already . 
  please , stop posting that . 
  we already have it : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22ez51/next_crimea_local_legislators_in_donetsk_declare/, 
  [ source of referendum date  ( https://twitter.com/shaunwalker7/status/453114805264871424 )  so there will be a referendum on the `` people 's republic of donetsk '' joining russia will take place no later than 11 may . 
  what the ... [ rt : activists declare donetsk republic after capturing regional administration in eastern ukraine ] ( http://rt.com/news/donetsk-republic-protestukraine-841/ ) :  the council in donetsk issued an address to russian president vladimir putin , asking for deployment of a temporary peacekeeping force to the region . 
  meanwhile new republic publishes [ letter from donetsk - `` busloads of people are coming from across the border of russia , armed with bats '' ] ( http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116960/letter-donetsk-not-pro-russia-its-menaced-russian-tourists )  but crimea is not the only place where we see russians . 
  here in southeastern ukraine they come as what we like to call `` tourists . `` this means busloads of people are coming from across the border of russia , armed with bats and other unpleasant things , who come to beat ukrainians who support their new government . 
  they came to kharkiv and beat the students there , and now they have come here . 
   i never imagined waking up in the morning , looking out the window and seeing armed people wearing masks outside , or knowing that they are somewhere near . 
  it 's absolutely beyond my peaceful and non-violent reality . 
   on march 6th , about ten thousand people took part in demonstrations for peace and for the unity of ukraine at lenin square in donetsk . 
  no one was surprised to see around 1,500 hired mercenaries and pro-russian activists at the same time in the same place . 
  also ** [ read that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22ez51/next_crimea_local_legislators_in_donetsk_declare/cgm8h3r ) ** . 
  yep , exactly . 
  same differences to these described exist within nearly every european country . 
  so , yes , statement that op made :  i always find it funny how many americans talk about `` europe '' as a whole is very much truth . 
   there are no reliable , up-to-date figures on its use but a 2009 survey of 1,300 mental health professionals found that more than 200 had tried to help at least one client to reduce the attraction they felt for somebody of the same sex . 
  and what 's wrong with that ? 
  i know that psychotherapists help husbands to `` reduce the attraction they felt for somebody '' else than their own wife , or other random people reducing attraction to someone of the opposite sex . 
  simply because there are logical reasons not to get into romance with that person yet he ( or she ) is very much attracted to her ( or him ) . 
  for me it looks like someone is trying to make a scandal from something that never was a scandal at all . 
  some people ca n't handle their emotions and need help with that - whatever it 's directed at opposite sex or not - there 's nothing wrong either with people looking for that help or people providing it !!, 
  looks like russians try very hard for everyone around to taste kremlin propaganda . 
  what , you have bbc broadcasted in latvia ? 
  lol now that 's weird . 
  what else you have there ? 
  mixed you with lithuania : / sorry . 
   bucharest ended up like this in the process .
