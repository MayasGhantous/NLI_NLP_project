  looks like a proper 21st century . 
  poland even after these investments will look like a joke comparing to uk when it comes to quality and availability of internet connections . 
   countries with indigenous minorities of other nationality ( since afaik , russophones in latvia are non-citizens ) , usually have rebroadcast agreements with the state tv 's of the ` motherlands ' . 
  is n't latvia the one country that did n't wanted to broadcast polish tv for polish minority living there ? 
  ( there 's 6.6 % of poles in latvia ), 
  so now being positive about invasions of countries controlled by regimes or * de facto * mafia is something tv can be banned for ? 
  seriously ? 
  from all of the reasons why one might consider banning american tvs - this would n't even hit my list . 
   it was restricted for broadcasting war propaganda . 
  considering how excessive their work was - i would consider ban from a government-owned tv frequencies to be perfectly valid . 
  if people can still get it from a privately owned channels , like satellite tv , ( and i presume they can ) than everything is in order . 
  they themselves obviously do n't give a shit about free speech so i 'm not sure if any arguments about infringing it would really work . 
  i 'm pretty sure that paying country like libya for permission to drop them would be cheaper than maintenance of these refugee camps . 
  then just give them a choice : either you say where from you are or libya awaits . 
  it 'd be problematic only in first year or two . 
  than they 'll learn that reaching europe does n't automatically mean that they 'll stay there and we 'll have some very nice decrease in deaths on a sea . 
  last time i checked nato was quite a successful deterrent . 
  density of russian troops slowly achieves critical mass . 
  really nice design . 
  like it , 
   is due to be completed by 2024 . 
  bummer : /, 
  you mean the same estonia that just signed deal for a new nato base on it 's territory ? 
  no , it wo n't . 
  nearly every country in europe is . 
  but relax - japan will be the first one to reach that status , so we can learn on their experiences , 
  duplicate of http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/225gif/eu_launches_flagship_sentinel_satellite_project/, 
  it 's in a middle , so ping times are good , 
  why any of these people is allowed to stay on melilla instead of being forced out to where they came from is beyond me . 
  it only encourages more people to do the same and more lives are lost . 
   flood the continent with non-white immigrants yea , hitler would very much agree with you , just replace `` non-white '' with `` non-aryans '' ( i guess he considered them to be `` purer white '' ) . 
  my point was that there was nothing to shed - poland was n't a marginal player even before crimea . 
  it was an opt-out , not opt-in filter . 
  if it 'd be an opt-in filter i would n't have anything against it . 
  and no , it 's not a `` porn filter '' - [ have a read ] ( http://ncac.org/the-great-firewall-of-britain/ ) or something , do n't get brainwashed by government . 
  missiles included ? 
  awesome , i 'll take a six-pack . 
   helping poland shed its image of a marginal player in eu policy making really ? 
  saying that after poland had a president of the european parliament as well as commissioner for financial programming and the budget ? 
  plus plenty of other influential people in the eu ... someone needs to catch up with reality . 
  you do n't have a say on things like these discussed in the article out of nowhere . 
   if your average american even knows [ we should n't go this way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmep97yqcrq ) ... , 
  bought in a shop . 
  so ... the answer to your question is that herman van rompuy is the guy that gets insulted in a one statement along with an entire country by ukip member ? 
  it 's quite a well known statement and i still think that what farage said there might have been told by a drunk retard under british pub , but never should have a place in public debate . 
  `` blocking ( ... ) internet traffic will become illegal in the european union '' - that 's a huge oversimplification . 
  otherwise the great firewall of cameron would become illegal . 
  and i have a very strong feeling uk wo n't suddenly switch into * freedom mode * when it comes to the internet . 
  feel sorry for latvia . 
  no need to worry lavrov , it 's all just a scheduled exercise . 
   we 're creating an island for more green energy production . 
  o_o wow ... that sounds epic . 
  any links ? 
   false hope how ? 
  hydro is better in all ways than solar and wind . 
  if you can build it without ruining the environment - yes , it is better . 
  sadly that 's not always an option - this is way solar plants will be always preferred closer to equator over hydro powerplants ( especially if certain countries got only few large rivers - like ethiopia which builds right now an enormous powerplant on a river nile that will have long term unforeseen consequences to all of the life down the river ) . 
  fossil fuels are more renewable than nuclear fuel is . 
  so . . yea . 
   it is less embarrassing if you use a useful measure like greenhouse gas emissions per capita . 
  still worse than poland with it 's evil coal mines everywhere . 
  it 's still rather suspicious - as far as i 'm aware global coal reserves are 200-300 years . 
  bp says that known reserves will last for 147 years ( if everyone would share them ) . 
  how did they come up with 500 years estimation ? 
  i guess they hope something similar to gas extraction will happen - some new process is going to be invented that allows mining of previously inaccessible resources . 
  mds work in mcdonalds . 
  yep . 
  now you , please , ready my post again and think for a moment , 
  uh , yes . 
  i 've eaten pretty much everything from that list in poland . 
  plus a few in czech and slovakia - but that 's probably only because i 've been there only few times . 
  i also know my family in ukraine knows way over half of the foods from that list . 
  so ... there 's noting special in that list , really . 
  in deed he is . 
  poor link i suppose  _  but i 'm nearly certain i 've read that polish coal reserves will last for over a 100 years . 
  oh well , do n't have time to google more than 2 minutes . 
  if it 's just 30 years - we 'll be largest energy importer in the world . 
  there is no way we could build alternative powerplants to cover entire country in 30 years . 
  and i guess we 'll see more protests from the coal miners than usually ... 
   i want energy independence . 
  then switch 100 % to renewable energy . 
  that 's the only way to have a real energetic independence . 
  afaik norwegian gas is too expensive . 
  even us proposed lower prices than norway , including shipping . 
  per person ? 
  trying to stick with a comfort zone ? 
   point is that : there are countries in europe ruining environment by far more than poland does , so let 's not go over the board with criticism . 
  [ edit ] here are stats : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal comes out that ** poland has lower impact on the environment than germany ** even in a statistic ** per person ** ( 8.6 vs 9.8 tonnes per inhabitant ) . 
  now deal with that !, 
  source ? 
  last time i checked it was [ roughly 120 years ] ( http://paliwa.inzynieria.com/cat/19/art/36212/mae-oszacowala-rezerwy-ropy--gazu-i-wegla - ), 
   does the coal industry have a strong vested influence in polish politics ? 
  coal miners do , but they 're not the reason for why we use so much coal to produce electricity . 
  it is purely practical matter . 
  we do n't have resources to build multiple nuclear powerplants ( one is under construction ) . 
  poland is on steady course increasing share of renewables ( 19 % by 2020 - everything seems like we 're on a road to achieve the goal without a problem ) , but in a scale of country-wide needs it 's just a small part that is also proportionally very expensive to what it outputs . 
   i think that poles have a much more pressing problems to deal with before they proceed for a moment it 's a state of our national grid . 
  lots of infrastructure still remembers soviet era and really needs modernization . 
  we did some in last years , but nowhere close to the needs . 
  total black-out of entire country is still a real possibility .
