   poland who bases its energy strategy on coal and continuing to ruin the climate fyi : polish energetic sector `` ruins '' environment by far less than german . 
  building nuclear power plant takes years and it wo n't satisfy even 1/4 of country energetic needs . 
  also few countries can really afford large-scale switch to nuclear powerplants , and those that can - have a very strong opposition to that both : among politicians and general population . 
  as for renewables - similar thing : they 're very expensive ( over 10 times more expensive than nuclear powerplants in some cases ) , ca n't be used everywhere , ca n't power entire grid , and there 's large distrust in society ( '' * global climate change scam * '' , '' * decreasing competitiveness of industry * '' , '' * rising prices of the energy * '' ) . 
  they 're practical . 
  could make a promises of covering polish desert with solar farms , but what for ? 
  that would never happen anyway . 
   well , but what if the respect for human rights , liberties and freedom are cultivated in that culture and country . 
  imagine the profound impact it will have on the rest of the middle east . 
  that 's why eu keeps turkey hanging on a promises - to make them improve and show rest of the middle east where 's the way to prosperity . 
  turkey even now is doing very well comparing to other countries from it 's region ( israel doing even better than them , but they 're vastly different from all of the other middle-east nations ) . 
   as to the heritage : turkey is close enough to europe to have some common history with european nations . 
  sometimes it was nasty ( ottoman empire etc. ), 
  sometimes not so much ( allies in military campaigns ) . 
  sadly : it 's mostly nasty . 
  but i 'm not sure if that matters much right now . 
  there 's much more to the reasons for why turkey is not in eu than just scandals or behaviour of the government ( regardless if it 's just this case or what you 're talking about ) . 
   based on what exactly ? 
  i gave you a quote , ready my post again - it 's all in there . 
  there are many similar opinions from both : economists and owners of private companies . 
  even my company ( it industry , so in theory one of least susceptible to such a change ) will close it 's uk office and move employees to germany or ireland if uk will be moving out of eu for real . 
  from your posts i see that you think leaving eu would n't affect companies and that majority of them are in uk for uk employees and/or uk market - you 're dreadfully wrong . 
  they are in uk because uk is the best option for them in the eu - if uk will be out of eu - they 'll find another country that will be the best one . 
   i believe nissan in sunderland actually export more nissan cars to japan than nissan japan manufactures itself . 
  [ nissan : we may quit britain if it leaves eu ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/10434906/nissan-we-may-quit-britain-if-it-leaves-eu.html ) . 
  and there 's more to follow ( [ another random example ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/04/goldman-sachs-warns-london-exit-britain-eu ) ) . 
  remember : economical power of uk now is n't the same as it 'd be after leaving eu . 
   forget what we would do . 
  every european firm would be gone in very short order ^ [ source ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/09/02/uk-britain-europe-goldman-idukbre9810hi20130902 ), 
  poland was calling for that long before ukrainian crisis ( even before nord stream affair in 2006 ) . 
  only now we have a very strong argument supporting our cause . 
   in an ideal world , the uk would find a totally unique model -- far fewer costs and full access to the eu market and a strong say over the rules . 
  i call that : cherry-picking model . 
  and sadly : that 's how large portion of uk media imagines it 'll look like , while anyone saying anything against that is automatically marked as an evil pro-eu lobbyist . 
   the decision on whether to approve the final uk-eu deal would be made by a so-called qualified majority vote , in which the uk itself would not take part . 
  a strengthened protectionist block of southern states could permanently block any liberal deal , whilst , without the uk , a northern liberal alliance would be radically weakened . 
  oh , i love these simplifications ... evil south and good north . 
   under eu law , the european parliament -- notoriously integrationist -- could also veto both an exit deal and future trade deals of course they can . 
  otherwise any country could demand to leave eu while still having a say in it 's polices and cherry pick best trade deals , like in proposed `` ideal world '' . 
  oh , and implying that being pro-integration is something evil got boring 2 years ago . 
   better off outers often make the valid point that `` we sell more to them than they sell to us '' , implying that the eu would strike a generous post-brexit trade deal out of sheer self-interest . 
  however , while a post-brexit uk could fairly easy strike a new deal on goods , i would n't be so sure of that . 
  eu would might want to block uk from as many trade deals as possible for two reasons : 1 . 
  encourage companies in uk to move back into eu ( i can easily imagine corporations like hyundai leaving uk as soon as it gets out of eu ) . 
  discourage other eu countries from following uk . 
  nearly all of these `` romanian foods '' are simply `` central & eastern-european foods '' . 
  but i guess headline like that is n't catchy enough . 
   why did n't my country think of it ? 
  you do n't have any maps that are that old . 
  ca n't wait to see china to weak up one day and make that : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0zte5z8tju, 
  yep , but from practical point of view - all you need is a national id card to enter uk if you 're from schengen area . 
  well , it 's hard to disagree with these arguments . 
  but let 's face it : turkey was n't close to joining eu even before all of these scandals came out to the daylight . 
   rich class is getting richer . 
  welcome to the 21st century . 
  i do n't know if you 've noticed but that 's a world-wide trend . 
   nigel farage , the leader of the united kingdom independence party ( ukip ) -- an anti-european and anti-immigrant party that is gaining momentum in britain -- declared last week that the european union has `` blood on its hands '' for negotiating a free-trade agreement in ukraine . 
  that 's not only him . 
  we had people with identical point of view even here on / r/europe . 
  here 's original post on a same topic : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21x8tb/lego_is_a_tool_of_satan_warns_polish_priest/, 
  no , they downvotes come from the fact that he grossly overestimates strength and logistical capacity of russian army . 
  whatever russia will take next bite from ukraine or not is a pure guess while he talks about it as if it 'd be a certainty - it 's not . 
  especially now when russia slowly calculates how much it 'll cost them to pacify it ( you quite clearly can see that they toned down their attitude and the amount of special forces intercepted by ukrainians in mainland drops ) . 
  also saying that russia will take whole ukraine clearly says that the guy has no slightest idea what 's the situation there . 
  and seriously - russia reclaiming eu countries as `` past soviet territories '' ? 
  what kind of total bs is that ? 
  that dude has no slightest idea in what world he lives . 
  it 's not '90s any more . 
  for those interested in situation there i can recommend : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plw613m86o5o4imgwtpbze59hrqdpbrhr8, 
  it 'll be first eufor mission in 5 years . 
  last one was eufor tchad/rca deployed to chad and central african republic from 2007 till march 2009 . 
  un forces took it over for almost two years , mission ended in december 2010 . 
  finally some good news from greece  looks like cutting the expenses paid off !, 
  growth , regaining their financial independence - brilliant . 
  keep it going greece !, 
  by comparison : only 0.7 % of people living in uk are chinese . 
   how about a double-headed robin ? 
  i read it : double-headed goblin, 
  also : fuck indonesia , comrade !, 
  it 's 1st of april joke , 
  thanks to putin ? 
  it 's [ pierogi ruskie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi#poland ) ( wikipedia argues it 's `` ruthenian pierogi '' , but thanks to putin we can keep calling them `` russian pierogi '' ),

  that 's nothing .

  nah , [ we had some success on that front already in the past ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war_in_1920 ) , 
  europe does not want into russia . 
  great , and really important news . 
  we still have 70 people dying every day on a roads , so any decrease of that number is something to cherish . 
   i was n't asked . 
  yes , you were . 
  indirectly in elections . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  one step at a time . 
  they 've been doing that for quite a while , so it 's nice to see another step done . 
  what 's wrong with the old canada ? 
  yes , it 's south ossetia . 
   another thing they did n't ask us is if we wanted to send our military troops in countries which only the american right-wing politicians wanted to attack . 
  random fun fact : noone ever can force any nato member to send it 's army abroad . 
  romania was asked to send it 's army just like every country that precipitated in nato operations outside of europe .
