   the international monetary fund announced agreement on a $ 14-18 billion standby credit for kiev in return for tough economic reforms that will unlock further aid from the european union , the united states and other lenders over two years . 
  this will be a very painful period for ukrainians . 
  during transformation in poland we had unemployment going up 3-fold , you could find villages where there was not even a single person employed . 
  at some point less than 20 % of unemployed had the right to benefits , while nearly 50 % of young people were unemployed . 
  government was also running an enormous privatization effort where many of newly created companies quickly bankrupted under incapable management . 
  those that survived first few years struggled quite horribly - situation in polish shipyards is something that many people still ca n't forgive to the previous governments . 
  getting corruption under control is also an enormous challenge that will meet a lot of resistance from people in power ( if not from government - than from police , justice system , and pretty much everyone used to taking them ) . 
  brace yourself , winter is coming . 
  german flag = confusing , 
  lakes in polish high mountains - notably : [ wielki staw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wielki_staw ) ( [ photo ] ( https://secure.flickr.com/photos/100208006@n04/9734682075/ ) ) and in general - tatry [ can be really amazing ] ( https://secure.flickr.com/photos/michalsleczek/3568267762/ ) and at the same time very different from alps . 
  on the other side of a border , in slovakia , there 's [ very nice ] ( http://mojeubytovanie.sk/images/stories/j3.jpg ) [ ice cave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dob%c5%a1insk%c3%a1_ice_cave ) and slovakia in general is very rich in caves ( which are quite close to each other if you go by car ) - really worth seeing . 
  ( this way you could tick two countries with one go  ) on the way you might want to see [ wroc\u0142aw ] ( http://www.wroclaw.pl/en/wroclaw-attractions ) which has tons of unique architecture ( featuring largest zoo in poland , centennial hall complex , amazing aula leopoldina , and tons of different things ) as well as a very rich history ( you 're from germany , so this might be particularly interesting for you ) while at the same time not being so full of tourists as ... [ krak\u00f3w ] ( http://www.krakow.pl/english/visit_krakow/2601,glowna.html ) which is another large city you might see on a way ( well ... not exactly , but relatively close ) - it 's famous from having second largest castle in poland , and really beautiful [ old town ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krak%c3%b3w_-_stare_miasto ) with plenty of reminder about jewish culture that used to be very rich in this city . 
   further restrictions have also been proposed regarding the right of residence while searching for a job . 
  time limits of three and six months are being considered , the interim report said . 
  say hello to homeless immigrants . 
   i 've been doing a little [ research ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org ) oh ... that 's a nice website there  switzerland for me - shame that my german is horrible and i always had hard time when learning it . 
  believe me - it 's far from being the best city to live in europe . 
  for many , many reasons . 
   that moving this equipment in bright day light without guards , looks not `` so threatening '' . 
  for you - not . 
  for media - yes . 
  it 's classical pr stunt . 
  ( moving impressive stuff in daylight hoping some random people will record that and publish online - very likely to happen considering how many people have smartphones these days ) russians hope to destabilize situation in ukraine even further . 
  ( politicians are busy with war instead of elections , separatists can smell `` crimea '' , etc. ), 
   the real moves are done at night and more guarded etc. 
  yep . 
  is n't romania planning to buy some brand new long and medium range sams ? 
  i know poland does . 
  you forgot to add that us actually have nuclear weapons deployed right now in belgium , germany , italy , the netherlands and turkey ready for use almost instantly given the permission . 
  rapid response capability is in there needed be ( and it works perfectly keeping russians at bay ) . 
  we did n't even exist on a map , cause you both and russians partitioned us long before world wars :( , 
   to which i say : hitler should have used bigger bombs then . 
  thank god americans listened to your advice . 
  try harder , cause that was completely unsuccessful attempt . 
  soldiers do n't need to know foreign languages , but many of the professional armies teach english anyway . 
  all of the officers in nato know english just fine - which is essential for chain of command . 
  i understand your logic , and it makes perfect sense , but eu is not usa . 
  we 're not one country . 
  unless federal europe would become reality - eu-wide conscription wo n't happen . 
  having eu army ( which to a degree already exists ) is by far more realistic than having eu conscription . 
  for many reasons ( mostly political ) . 
  which makes even more sense for non-nato eu members to push for eu armed forces . 
  [ yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eufor_tchad/rca ) , [ more than once ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eufor_dr_congo ) ( and these are just ops within eufor ), 
   yes , but ca n't much of that be solved through the european union recruiting directly from the population ? 
  too much resistance from population to do that . 
  people would need to identify themselves as `` europeans '' before `` french '' , `` poles '' or whoever else for that to work . 
  it 's by far easier to simply integrate eu armies while still let them keep their national identity than trying to implement eu conscription . 
  not to mention all of the legal stuff ( every eu country got different polices on a conscription - gaps in the approach are enormous and many countries do n't want it to change for various , very reasonable , reasons ) . 
   you should n't have a problem convincing them to lease some land for bases & training . 
  leasing bases and proving grounds is least of a problem , really . 
  not really - they 're cooperating quite closely with nato on two levels : economic ( arms exports and imports ) and strategical ( shared exercises , strategies , etc. 
  ) , they 're not a members though what makes them a perfect target group for joined eu armed forces . 
  and they already very actively take part in it - sweden was the country that initiated [ nbg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battle_group ) and is the largest contributor to this part of [ eubg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) . 
  also us would most likely be very happy of that as it means less expenses on us forces stationed in eu ( though that certainly is n't on their list of priorities right now ) . 
   now throw in sweden and finland not being in nato at all ( so they lacksall the extra cross-training , integration and standardization that other eu states have with each other through it ) both sweden and finland use standard nato equipment . 
  sweden even supplies several nato countries with arms exports . 
  ( i do n't know about finland exports though ) they also take part in some of the nato exercises and , what might surprise you , [ they even host some ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loyal_arrow ) . 
   and well shit ... it 's like one step forward and two steps back . 
  it 's like saying that nato is making two steps back for every step forward because some countries prefer stronger local alliances than these offered by nato itself . 
  all of the issues you listed apply as much to eu army as they do to nato - yet nato exists and works just fine having regular trainings , troops exchange , shared operations , etc. 
   it seems odd to have a european union army when you have nato not all of the eu countries are in nato . 
  try to search around on this reddit - we already had similar discussions ( one of the better started with a guy asking if eu should have an unified armed forces a week or two ago ) - you 'll find plenty of opinions . 
   the eu was founded on voluntary ideas , far from establishing a common military . 
  [ eu actually already has a common military unit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) . 
  it industry is very specific . 
  whatever you live in romania , lithuania , hungary , poland , or germany - you will always have tons of terms directly borrowed from english even if there are direct equivalents in your native language - it 's quicker and more understandable to us the same terms in spoken language as you use in code and/or find in manuals . 
  i would n't use it jargon as a way to judge anything about spoken language . 
  sadly - that does n't even come close the the most cruel things done there . 
  rt can do whatever they want - noone will give a shit after whole world seen that they 're nothing more than kremlin propaganda machine . 
  if you 'll outzoom you 'll see that poland is using that `` peninsula '' of it 's own territory pretty much only for mining . 
  there 's a large open-pit coal mine with a powerplant . 
   protecting ~ ~ from ~ ~ the people on the continent , at least . 
  there we go , fixed that for ya . 
  that evaluation is for gripen c/d , not e - irrelevant in context of this article . 
  ( if it 's real in a first place ), 
  every article or comment about military equipment containing `` best '' in the headline can be freely skipped . 
  poll made to show results desired by it 's authors . 
  let 's take for example a question '' * do you believe west 's reaction has been appropriate or overwrought ? 
  * '' - why there 's no option to say that reaction was too calm or that i have no opinion on that matter ? 
  it 's just neutral and negative ( depending on point of view ) completely omitting positive and no opinion . 
  whoever made this survey tried very much not to be objective . 
  so . . what about non-eu citizens doing the same thing ? 
  why it 's only aimed at the eu citizens ? 
  [ 25 % of americans do n't know earth orbits the sun ] ( http://news.discovery.com/space/astronomy/1-in-4-americans-dont-know-earth-orbits-the-sun-yes-really-140214.htm ) . 
   i would n't be so sure of these stats are as relevant to the general public opinion as they seem to be . 
  many of those people simply repeat what they learn at school/home without really going into the matter . 
   i think at some point or another all european nations were involved in awful atrocities . 
  yes , only these were quite recent ( some of those who lost their parents or grandparents in that massacre still live in poland ) and usually people do n't praise ( or even : glorify ) those responsible for ethnic cleansing . 
  '' * slava ukraini * '' was what upa was shouting under red-black flags while murdering entire villages , torturing people and killing them in most [ atrocious ways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia#methods ) man can imagine . 
  of course [ ukrainians died too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia#ukrainian_casualties ) and we 'll well aware of this and a fact that there were ukrainians helping poles in those days , it 's just that the scale and cruelty of upa is something that still brings terror in a `` hive mind '' of poles . 
   it 's important that we acknowledge that , apologize and move on . 
  of course . 
  sadly i think this moment did n't come yet . 
  we moved on with germans , and that certainly was a great lesson for both sides , so i hope poles and ukrainians will learn to face their history in equal measure . 
   bohdan khmelnytsky was n't the saint either , and likely caused even more deaths among poles . 
  yes , but xvii century is distant history that we know only from books . 
  and i think that 's a major difference - * time heals all wounds * . 
   people carry that flag not because of its anti-polish meaning , let alone because of the brief connection to nazi germany . 
  ( ... ) but i do n't think praising him as a national leader means being anti-polish or `` radical '' . 
  of course .
