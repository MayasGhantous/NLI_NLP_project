  if we would think otherwise you would n't see as much support from poland as you do , 
   katyn massacre was mass execution of polish prisoners carried out by soviet secret police . 
  most importantly : this was a massacre of polish officers , engineers , scientists , teachers , businessmen - in general : polish elite of that era . 
  that 's why poles find it very difficult to forget about it . 
   intended to bring up the memories about the atrocities committed by ukrainian insurgent army . 
  we 're perfectly aware of that , and topic of upa is very common in public discuss on ukraine and euromaidan ( politicians faced a lot of accusations for taking part in a march that had black-red flags ) . 
  only , you see , poles actually can see a difference between radicals and majority of euromaidan protesters . 
  something many pro-russian people do n't . 
  i 'm impressed , 
   russian law enforcement raided an arms group that smuggled weapons to the country 's north caucasus ** from the european union ** via ukraine , ( ... )  crossing detained several of the smugglers , who had in their possession pistols made by desert eagle , smith & wesson , sig sauer and others . 
  cia wo n't be happy about that . 
  :d hahahaha . 
  you sir , just won this argument . 
  ca n't wait to see polish katowice declaring independence and turning into dubai of coal miners . 
  i think your description is wrong . 
  it looks like a flag of ukraine , not an actual split . 
  split that russians proposed was suppose to happen along borders of current ukrainian districts , with kharkiv and odessa being russian . 
  how about that : magyarorsz\u00e1g ^ that 's in hungarian . 
  this map is missing part that russia takes . 
  which is everything from southern and eastern ukraine . 
  blocking remaining , middle part , from any access to the black sea . 
  yep . 
  exactly . 
  [ something to show each time folks try to point fingers at nationalists on maidan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbgpgsmguku&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=210 ), 
  said the guy with silesian flag in his flair . 
  it 's disputable . 
   belarus and ukraine : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_riga get your facts straight . 
  in march 1921 there was no belarus nor ukraine as a separate countries . 
  it was all ussr - ussr that attacked poland . 
  ukrainians were fighting for their independence during that time , but in march they still have n't had it . 
  yes , in a way it was a betrayal of people fighting for independent ukraine , but it was n't a partitioning . 
   jackals gathered around the dead body you got your quote wrong . 
   this was little different from what stalin did to poland in 1939 . 
  it was very much different once you try to find out what was the situation back in 1938 . 
  poland was surprised by zsrr attack , and it was one of the reasons why german invasion succeeded so greatly - on the other hand poland notified czechoslovakian government before sending it 's own troops to zaolzie and czechoslovakia agreed on that knowing that germans are about to annex their country - it was basically lesser of two evils for them . 
  ( still though it 's certainly a shameful act , one of the darkest pages of inter-war history of poland ), 
  google translate :  on friday , vladimir putin signed a law on the adoption of the crimea and sevastopol to russia , which means their final accession as the 84th and 85th regions . 
  one of the legal consequences of the recognition of the peninsula will become part of russian criminal liability for those who will speak publicly about the need to bring it back to the ukraine . 
   c may 9 calls to action for the return of the crimea to ukraine will be punished by a heavy fine or up to five years , it should be signed at the end of 2013 , vladimir putin law on amendments to art . 
  280 of the criminal code . 
  ** newly introduced article 280.1 `` public calls for action to violate the territorial integrity of the russian federation '' ** complements article on punishment for calls for extremism and states that such appeals shall be ** punished by a fine or up to 300 thousand rubles . 
  or two-year income , or by compulsory works for a term of up to 300 hours , or imprisonment for up to three years ** . 
  if those appeals will be ** in the media or on the internet ** - by compulsory works for a term of up to 480 hours or by imprisonment for ** up to five years ** . 
   the bill was adopted on the initiative of the communist party gennady zyuganov , in collaboration with the communist deputies . 
  he passed the parliament as soon as possible - made december 10 , 2013 , december 20 for a third reading vote 447 deputies of the state duma , and already 28 december 2013 signed by vladimir putin . 
  nevertheless , the law will come into force until may 9 , 2014 . 
   the explanatory note zyuganov and other deputies noted that the territorial integrity of the current legislation is not considered as a separate object of criminal law protection , so `` imposed rules allow prevent possible separatist tendencies and calls for action to the assignment of the russian territory to foreign countries , as well as prevent the spread of information to justify these actions . '', 
  `` every state shall refrain from any action aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity of the territorial integrity of any other state or country , '' - quoted lawmakers declaration on principles of international law , adopted by the un in 1970 . 
   for opinion or debate on the advisability of joining the crimea to russia to prosecute under this law should not , says one of the authors of the initiative , an mp from the communist party vadim solovyov . 
  `` the law we are talking about such calls , such as : '' boys , let 's take up arms and disconnect the crimea '' - he explained rbc . 
  deputy ilya ponomarev , only voted against the adoption of the crimea to russia , will avoid criminal liability , sure soloviev . 
  however , he admits that `` fools and no law may be different excesses . '', 
   `` there was a case - an example mp - when gennady zyuganov wanted to prosecute for contempt of the president when he 's on one of his meetings with voters told an anecdote about putin . 
  there have already started testing , but gennady andreyevich then putin personally told this anecdote , the president laughed , and that the incident was over . '', 
   the penal code also punishes incitement to terrorist activity or public justification of terrorism , calls for extremist activities and aggressive war . 
  so practice on various types of public appeals have already gained , reminds chairman of the moscow regional bar association `` sazonov and partners '' vsevolod sazonov . 
  in particular , there is a resolution of the plenum of the supreme court 's practice in cases of crimes of an extremist nature , which understands public calls expressed in any form ( oral , written , using technical means or the internet ) access to others to encourage them to extremism . 
  it does not matter whether it was possible the man who criticizes the crimea to russia or ukraine urges to give it , to encourage other citizens to any action , the court will consider bringing to justice regardless of this , said sazonov . 
   the treatment of the film will depend on the discretion of law enforcement , says doctor of law , professor of constitutional and municipal law hse elena lukyanov . 
  `` if it will be necessary to deal with someone , problems with the interpretation does not arise , '' - she said . 
  they never thought this army would have to fight with russia . 
  ukraine hoped that budapest memorandum would make russia along with us , uk and france a countries that guarantee ukrainian borders . 
  in the end though it came out that budapest memorandum was worth as much as paper it was written on , so ukrainian army can pretty much only step down hoping to avoid causalities . 
   how much of those bases , for instance , was paid for by people in the rest of ukraine ? 
  vast majority of the infrastructure is post-soviet . 
  everything else was paid by ukrainian government . 
  kiev is contributing over 500\u00a0000\u00a0000 usd each year to crimean budget for development of the region . 
  but there 's one huge additional cost on top of what you mentioned : warships , fighters and military equipment . 
  i would n't be surprised if cost of warships alone would by far exceed cost of military bases ( if you forget about airports for a moment - these are quite expensive to both : build and maintain ) . 
   how much of ukraine 's debt should be assumed by crimea ? 
  as far as i 'm aware : noone really knows that just yet . 
  and noone will know until ukraine acknowledges crimean anschluss . 
  google translate is n't particularly great . 
  ok , corrected . 
  only korwin-mikke is ... basically like a parrot : you keep him in a cage cause he is funny , but do n't let him fly around the room because he will shit everywhere around . 
  so he is kept safely outside of the polish parliament . 
  this dude here on the other hand is a vice-chairman of the state duma , what changes things a little bit . 
   but tbh : i never heard of him . 
  still though find the whole thing to be totally ridiculous . 
  especially when this proposal went to poland - from all of the countries around , knowing our history ... 
  it 's just one gigantic facepalm . 
  google translate :  according to tvp ( polish national tv ) , the polish ministry of foreign affairs received an ** official letter from the state duma of the proposed division of the territory of ukraine ** . 
  poland was proposed to take the western districts . 
  - it 's just a sick mind can come up with - commented on the matter adviser to the president , prof. presidential adviser . 
  vice-chairman of the state duma and leader of the liberal democratic party of russia vladimir zhirinovsky has already said that poland should follow in the footsteps of russia and demand that ukraine `` devotion territories that are not ukrainian . '', 
  it was difficult , however , to suppose that the words of the controversial policy actions will follow , namely - officially a letter to the polish foreign ministry . 
   zhirinovsky : let poland make a call for a referendum  vladimir zhirinovsky proposes to poland demanded a referendum on the accession of our country to the five western regions of ukraine : volyn , lviv , iwanofrankowskiego , ternopil and rivne . 
  a similar `` offer '' got hungary and romania ws . 
  carpathian circuits and chernivtsi . 
  within ukraine would remain only its central part . 
   such opinions expressed zhirinovsky after the crimean referendum , arguing that `` it is time to not only russian lands were returned under the russian flag . '', 
  - the lands of western ukraine in the time of stalin 's regime were correctly attached to the soviet union . 
  the idea was to stop the german armies as far as possible ( from the borders of the soviet union ) . 
  but it was not the russian lands , they were not ukrainian lands - said then . 
   in a letter sent to the polish foreign ministry zhirinovsky argues that within the limits of ukrainian nationality were large differences in the mentality that they can not live together . 
  `` mutual dislike for many years accompanied by open conflicts , often transforming itself into a bloody massacre - entire villages were annihilated during the brutal fighting between polish and ukrainian nationalists '' - writes . 
  it is worth noting that the father of the zhirinovsky came from western ukraine . 
   `` the proposals are eccentric ... ''  - proposals are so peculiar that no one takes them seriously - says marcin wojciechowski foreign ministry spokesman , confirming that there is indeed such a letter from the russian duma received . 
  - vladimir zhirinovsky will get a courtesy reply , without reference to the content of your letter - ministry of foreign affairs announced . 
  - part of the russian elite still thinks in terms of the molotov-ribbentrop pact - sums wojciechowski .
