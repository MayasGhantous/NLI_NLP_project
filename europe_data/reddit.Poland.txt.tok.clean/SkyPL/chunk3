  being in a middle class is not determined by happiness or a `` good life '' . 
  it also got nothing to deal with being a hippie or not . 
  if we 're on that topic - i would like to warn everyone that staring at the eclipse through ** any optical device that 's focusing light ** , such as through the camera , can cause ** extremely quick and permanent eye damage ** if you do n't have an appropriate solar filters . 
  * nd filters are ** not ** suitable for viewing solar eclipse . 
  even strongest nd filters block visible light , but still lets very powerful and damaging uv light to pass through . 
  * if you have a dslr with live view - it 's always good to use it instead of an optical viewfinder as a precaution , but even then i would recommend using filter for solar photography if you want to shoot sun before it 's covered by the moon . 
  * ** sunglasses are also not suitable ** for looking directly at the sun - they do not block enough uv and ir light to prevent retina damage after longer exposure to the sun light . 
  so-called '' * uv filters * '' on glasses are nowhere near powerful enough to prevent eye damage from staring directly at the sun , they were never designed for that . 
  * tricks like squinting your eyes or looking with only one eye / corner of the eye do not help either . 
  things like sunglasses or smoked glass create a ** false illusion of safety ** . 
  why sun light is dangerous is because of all the uv radiation it emits - you wo n't see it , but it is there and it is dangerous . 
  your brain wo n't react to the uv radiation in the same way that it does to full spectrum of light , you wo n't feel pain , you will just start loosing sight . 
  unless you have equipment dedicated to solar photography or observing solar eclipse - you are risking permanent eye damage . 
  it 's not too dangerous if you are not focusing the light ( binoculars , lenses , telescopes , etc. ), 
  but even then - do n't try to look at the sun for minutes . 
  it might be tempting to watch the whole event from very beginning to the total eclipse in one go , but it 's also a great way to damage your eyesight if you do not have a proper , safe filters . 
  the safest way to observe solar eclipse is by using camera obscura ( hole in a black paper ) , binoculars or telescope to cast an image on paper in a [ setup similar to this ] ( http://astrobob.areavoices.com/files/2012/05/solar-eclipse-baja-projection-methods1-400x282.jpg ) . 
  with that method you can even see sunspots - it 's not only ** very safe but also lets you see more ** . 
  and under any circumstances - ** do not force yourself into looking at the sun ** . 
  if your eyes hurt - stop , right away , and take a break . 
  pain is the only thing your body can do to prevent permanent eye damage . 
  do n't fight it !, 
  sorry for rambling about permanent eye damage over and over again , but this is really serious stuff and becomes only more serious as more and more people without any knowledge try to observe the eclipse using various weird methods . 
  sometimes i 'm terrified by just how stupid things people can do during the eclipse . 
   the eclipse will apparently only partially be seen tho ? 
  yes . 
  you will see around 60 % . 
  esti can into nordic !, 
  seriously though : what 's the point of it ? 
  someone must have put a lot of work into that . 
  looks like a wasted time . 
  it 's `` equally populated '' , not `` equally sized '' . 
  [ best fragment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-1lqu6mae&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=470 ) :  but it really strikes a chord . 
  that 's how we germans work . 
   devastating europe two times within a century , but going nuts when somebody 's giving us the finger . 
  objective debating utterly out of question . 
   when greeks gives us the finger , we totally freak out . 
  cause we 're germans .

   middle class means a good life . 
  all what middle class means is that it 's between working class and upper class . 
  it got nothing to deal with having a good life . 
  i know plenty of people who definitely are not a middle class yet have a great lives that go above and beyond consumption , just like i know plenty of people who are middle class yet live miserable lives focused around consumption and every day stuff , usually buisness-related . 
  yea ... it ends in 1998 , so ...  the graph i linked to is a visualization of a [ data ] ( http://api.worldbank.org/countries/pol/indicators/si.pov.gini?per_page=1000 ) provided by the world bank api . 
  i do n't know if it 's useful for what you are doing but it might , so take a look . 
  [ mid 90s are a period when gini had an enormous growth , but peak was in 2004 ] ( https://www.quandl.com/data/worldbank/pol_si_pov_gini-poland-gini-index ) . 
  sorry , i should have linked source right away . 
  yes . 
  the peak of polish gini was in 2004 - when sld was near the end of it 's government , the party which as many politicians with roots in the communist regime . 
  poland is pathetic when it comes to r&d expenses . 
  then polish media are surprised that nothing is invented in our country , and so this nonsense expectation that something will be born out of nothing continues . 
  fyi : poland was n't a party in first vienna award . 
  only four countries did : hungary , germany , italy and ** czechoslovakia ** . 
  that :  poland actively worked with nazi germany to expand its territory . 
  is a total nonsense . 
  territories taken from slovakia by poland on a basis of anything remotely related to first vienna award were taken in cooperation with hungary , not nazi germany , and they were miniscule . 
  226 km \u00b2 according to wikipedia . 
  your government agreed on first vienna award . 
  it was nothing like munich agreement which was purely 3rd party agreement . 
  here is why they did it :  czechoslovak minister of foreign affairs was focused on building new relationships with germany and italy to negotiate guarantees for new borders -- stop grasping at straws in an attempt to make poland into some evil conquering empire collaborating with nazis . 
  if you want to stick with facts - [ let 's try that one for a change ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii#poland ) :  unlike in most european countries occupied by nazi germany -- where the germans sought and found true collaborators among the locals -- in occupied poland there was no official collaboration either at the ** political ** or at the economic level . 
  so how about taking a break and just facing a reality : our ** both ** nations were victims of that war and we ** both ** suffered incredible things from nazi germany and later on the ussr . 
  these games on how one or another country pushed border here or there are pathetic and meaningless in a scope of events that followed . 
  there 's really much more of what we ** share ** than what divides us . 
  i got baader astrosolar film - used it for solar photography . 
  but right now i do n't have any tele lens , so i 'll just use it for home-made eclipse viewing set , 
  mcdonalds :(, 
  if czechoslovakia was n't a subject to the munich agreement and betrayal from western countries poland would n't take zaolzie . 
  and if czechs would n't take zaolzie in 1920 we would n't have this discussion in a first place . 
  if here , if there , pointless discussion about pointless events . 
  [ weather forecast ] ( http://www.skystef.be/forecast14.html ) does n't seem to be too great - it 's cloudy in most of northen europe . 
  looks like those who took a trip to see the total eclipse are about to be disappointed . 
   by adopting an eu wide law about minority groups , to offer them protection . 
  why the heck it got anything to deal with laws for minorities ? 
  noone should be punished like that , regardless if he is a child or adult , majority or minority . 
  we do n't need a new eu-wide law for every single `` thing done wrong '' across 28 member states . 
   in eastern bloc countries , uk still lives in a cold war . 
  time to wake up . 
  eastern bloc is long gone . 
   is because of our expansionist practices in eastern europe not again this nonsense . 
   russia 's point of view & realise there are consequences for trying to interfere in their sphere of influence . 
  any sort of deals to be made in this area have to be done in conjunction with russian support independent countries have a right to decide their fate on their own , make agreements with whoever they want and discuss whatever they prefer without asking any 3rd party for permission . 
  fyi : [ russia had plans for re-taking crimea before any events of euromaidan happened ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/blog/aillar/1466544-echo/ ) . 
  bs you are repeating is nothing more than a russian propaganda to put doubts if sticking to the international law and order is something worth doing . 
  i despise muppets like you getting hooked up on that . 
  you forget that hungary was one of the aggressors then , as well . 
  and fyi : ** poland did not `` work with hitler '' ** . 
  they merely used an opportunity , but it never in any way was discussed or agreed with hitler or germany . 
  for a whole 11 months . 
  some people seen it as far south as wroc\u0142aw . 
  sadly here were i am sky is very cloudy today , so ca n't see even stars , not to mention any aurora . 
   ca n't deny that the first elections almost-won by po was basing on young people and promises of `` 1-mandate voting regions '' , lower taxes , less bueraucracy , etc. 
  the only thing they did from these promises was suspending mandatory conscription . 
  and lower bureaucracy . 
  back in early ' 00s it was really , really bad . 
  especially if you owned a company . 
  now it 's bearable . 
  there is no easy answer for that question . 
  each part of what we consider `` internet '' was created by different people for different purpose .
