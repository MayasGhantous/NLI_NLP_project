   - it is outrageous to propose poland , as experienced changes in boundaries , participation in the partition of a friendly country . 
  it 's just a sick mind can come up with - said in a bbc adviser to the president of poland - actually , this letter would be sent to a psychiatrist - he added . 
  really ? 
  i must be too new here , cause so far i have n't heard anything in line of `` flying piles of junk '' - imho gripen is basically the best option for countries that ca n't afford eurofighter or f35 . 
  for those interested : [ aircraft inventory of czech air force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_air_force#aircraft_inventory ), 
  hehehe , good one  so ... how many autobahns did they build ? 
  bill did not pass legislation process . 
  and that 's the key to whole issue . 
  key that many people totally forget about . 
  nope , it was n't top priority , no clue where did you find that information . 
  previous crimean government got just one radically pro-russian party . 
  it won 3 seats in elections . 
  and guess what ? 
  somehow it has a prime minister right now . 
  prime minister that is a russian citizen . 
  `` the other parties '' you speak of were : party of regions - which won elections in a whole ukraine at the time and currently holds a majority of seats in kiev , communist party of ukraine - which might be considered pro-russian but it 's more pro-communism than anything else , playing on sentiments for ussr . 
  and the 3rd largest party was crimean tatar one which was clearly anti-russian . 
  it 's not completely wrong . 
  something you call `` considerable popular support '' never reached anything above 50 % in independent surveys . 
  peaks of activity happened when russia was during the war time - like in georgia , but during peace support for separation went below 20 % on some years . 
  reality you need to face is that majority of crimeans did n't really wanted separation before armed russians appeared on the streets , and only political party openly demanding crimea to become part of russia got 4 % in elections . 
  cyprus never joined nato . 
  and besides - neither turkey nor greece have a nuclear weapons . 
  their tiny dispute is rather meaningless comparing to disputes georgia , moldova and ukraine have . 
  ( no offence to the inhabitants of unsinkable aircraft carrier ), 
  yea , we usually have just one big air show . 
  now nato sponsors a second one - without tickets or need to go all the way to the airport . 
  first situation needs to stabilize before anyone puts his money on a foreign soil . 
  yep , i 'd go for london too . 
  tons of tourists , people and students from all around the world , organized minorities from dozens of countries , and the fact that they speak english makes it really a place where you can talk to people from nearly every corner of the world . 
  somehow i 'm not convinced that joining any countries having territorial disputes with nuclear ex-superpower is a good idea . 
  i really hope it just stays on a level of initial agreements and wo n't go much further than that . 
  afaik nato follows general principle that country joining it 's structures should n't have any active territorial disputes . 
  eu should have done the same . 
  on the other just over a year ago someone set fire to a mosque in bia\u0142ystok ( where i happen to live ) . 
  to be fair - similar thing happened to catholic church in ptaszkowa ( build in 1555 ) and few other places around poland . 
  somehow burning religious buildings become popular in last few years o_o . 
  anyone is idolizing them ? 
   xiv century history [ xiv century you say ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/pu%c5%82k_jazdy_tatarskiej ) ? 
  poland - yes . 
  but we had this topic long before crimea , that 's why we 're building [ lng terminal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awinouj%c5%9bcie_lng_terminal ) . 
  it should be ready at the end of this year ( nearly perfect timing ) . 
  there are also plans to build [ nuclear powerplant in \u017barnowiec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbarnowiec_nuclear_power_plant ) ( english articles discusses it mostly in a context of powerplant that was supposed to be build by communists , but that location was selected for a new powerplant after the competition between 28 different locations ) - initial plans were to have it ready by 2020 , but knowing polish reality - it 'll be delayed at least by a year . 
  certainly current events put some more pressure on the project , which is always a good thing ( just look at euro 2012 - public pressure can do miracles !, 
   additionally germans are extra apologetic after ww2 , they 've paid reparations , officially apologised etc. 
  ( which can not be said about russians ) . 
  that did really a lot to calm down moods in poland , but it certainly was n't the only factor . 
  we had a lot of tourists in poland from germany and they left really positive impressions . 
  poles working in germany and being treated rather nicely is also something to be remembered ( contrary to newspaper headlines about '' * italian work camps * '' where polish immigrants were forced to work in some very bad conditions ) . 
  then there 's whole lot of shared interests between poles and germans in eu , and many , many other things that come into my mind . 
  these days even elder people look rather positively at germany - which is quite surprising all things considered ( my college grandparents still believe with some jewish conspiracy theories , but they never really speak about germans in any negative tone ) - somehow the distinction between nazi germany and modern-day germans really build up over the years . 
  seems like germans did great job establishing relations between themselves and poles . 
  yea ... you 're not starving despite of these prices !, 
  that qualifies as `` rich '' in our dictionary . 
  oh yea , wroclaw is my favourite city . 
  great mix of culture , people , and tons of things to see while still not being corrupt by purely tourist approach like krakow is . 
  i also really enjoyed polish mountains - zakopane is the `` winter capital of poland '' with tens of thousands of tourists , but there 's plenty of smaller , more calm villages nearby . 
  and in spare time you can take a short trip by car to slovakia - they got some of the most amazing caves in entire europe . 
  here be dragons . 
  yea , last time a friend of my tried that doctor kicked her out of the office threatening to call the police . 
  they got their seats in elections . 
  i do n't know much about positions they hold right now , but [ if i were you i would read this before making any insinuations ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20tyhu/head_of_ukrainian_state_tv_physically_forced_to/cg79yuj ) . 
  [ or that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20tyhu/head_of_ukrainian_state_tv_physically_forced_to/cg79nck ) . 
  still - there 's certainly a far-right electorate in ukraine , and hardly anything anyone in eu can do about it . 
  surprises every day . 
  great idea , but french will never agree on that . 
   an european defense treat could be enough , but anyway with the nato i do n't see the need . 
  if a nato member in europe is being attacked other european armies will help . 
  you mean : sweden and finland are fucked up ? 
  ( these are just two examples of countries that are members of eu , but not nato )  the problem here is the nuclear power . 
  is anyone willing to use it ? 
  i do n't think so but , what if russia attacks a nato member ? 
  the fact is that they know the consecuences , so the question is what kind of response do we do . 
  even if russia would attack nato member - noone would use nukes imho . 
  even if territory of one nato country would be fully occupied by russia - nato still would n't use nukes unless russia does it first , or gets dangerously close to doing so . 
  you see - risks are just too high . 
  countries can be retaken , if not now then in a year , 5 or 10 . 
  meanwhile nuclear fallout lasts centuries and no anti-missile system is 100 % accurate . 
  yep . 
  `` win '' in such a war would be to keep a current borders . 
  not in gaining any territory from russia . 
  seems like some people ca n't get rid of world war 2 & cold war mentality ( fight for everything or nuke the hell out of world - that 's not how wars will look like in xxi century ), 
   russia is not invading finland year ago everyone would say exactly the same about ukraine ( just to remind you - ukraine and russia consider themselves `` brotherhood '' nations - it was as likely to happen as us invading uk ) . 
  same in poland ( directly borders with russia ) - we still have trainings of our air forces where you can see migs landing on a roads ( and not just highways - we have too few of these in poland so it 'd be too obvious . 
  i once seen photographs from mig 29s landing on a road in a middle of the forest - looked epic , i admire skill of these pilots ) . 
  and here it begins . 
  what i was most afraid of . 
  comes out that these [ x ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zu03v/tatars_in_crimea_are_getting_giant_x_markings_on/ ) - es painted on the doors of crimean tatars were just a sign of a things to come . 
  and think that people so easily dismissed it . 
  i doubt they 'll move them out of crimea , cause that would be very provoking move to everyone around , especially turkey , but still - no good can come out of it . 
  it 's really amazing how well-prepared russians were to this invasion and how every move goes so smoothly . 
  almost as if everything would be planned years ahead and just waited for a chance to be executed ... 
  i see what you did here ;  , 
  wikipedia says that verification is needed - afaik turkey is n't allowed to close it completely . 
  unless you can show some reliable source that would n't be disputed even by wikipedia itself - point still stands . 
  i would argue that they 're culturally not europeans either . 
  no offence to turkey , but i ca n't see any reason to have turkey in eu . 
  they 're in nato already - that 's pretty much all we need . 
   b : integrate the rest of ukraine into nato with missile shields etc. 
  not with crimea occupied by russia .
