  glad that people actually were able to see it and kick him out of his office as soon as his term run out . 
  watched the same video and seen something completely different than you do : people in all age feeling in duty to defend their country from russian invasion . 
  everything made under ukrainian flags by regular citizens - not `` fascists '' . 
  unless something happened in last few weeks and we started to put equation mark between people who care about their nation and nazis . 
   even angela merkel has talked about putting more emphasis on subsidiarity in europe . 
  powers should go to europe when that is appropriate , and go to national governments when that is appropriate . 
  and i completely agree with this statement . 
  only problem being that when i hear it from a country that 's second largest power in europarliament after these elections will be ukip - the first thing that comes into my mind is `` cherry picking '' , not an actual improvements in legislation ( which imho are needed , mostly because some of the laws ( especially these on a topic of agriculture ) go way over the board of what eu should focus on ) . 
  yea ... 
  i hate when brits use that as a keyword for everything that 's supposedly `` wrong '' with eu . 
  [ why the crimean `` referendum '' is a manipulation : 10 facts you should know ] ( http://maidantranslations.com/2014/03/16/why-the-crimean-referendum-is-a-manipulation-10-facts-you-should-know/ ), 
  hahahaha :d nice how the same words mean different stuff in different languages . 
  strong words . 
  i really hope it wo n't come to that . 
  it actually means * truth * . 
  you 're really surprised ? 
  i guess that 's a testimony to how little western europeans know about eastern europe . 
   reform is good , but cameron may be too ambitious . 
  ambitious ? 
  for me it sounds like a list of demands intentionally made in a way that makes it impossible to achieve not to mention the fact that half of it is against anything eu wants to achieve and smells more like a cherry picking - what cameron wants can stay , but anything that somehow does n't lay in line with his political goals should be kicked out . 
  i agree very much with a principle of '' * europe if necessary , national when possible * '' but what cameron wants is `` europe if it suits me , national when possible '' . 
  i 'm honestly very disappointed cameron 's demands . 
  i hoped for fresh air in eu and really someone pushing for more modern eu refreshing it 's law-making for a benefit of all while still staying true to it 's principles . 
  instead we got a fart . 
  same as this one : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20jpfe/david_cameron_sets_out_agenda_for_eu_reform/, 
  czechoslovakia and crimea are two vastly different examples that got exactly nothing to deal with each other . 
  russians on crimea are free to move to their dream-land few km away from their current houses any time they 'd like to . 
  slovakians did n't have their own country and czechoslovakia was an artificial creation forced upon their centuries-long homeland by the allies . 
  majority of russians was brought to crimea in 1944 , it 's not their fatherland . 
  and yet they got vast autonomy living peacefully side-by-side with tatars and ukrainians since ukraine become independent - to the point where separatist party got 4 % in elections to crimean parliament ( just one of many lies in linked article - it were n't elections to the ukrainian parliament as author suggests ) . 
  not to mention the fact that vast majority of crimeans , even ethnically russian , on crimea consider themselves ukrainians , not russians ( again : independent surveys made before invasion ) . 
  and so on , and so on ... 
  in that whole point 4 there 's not a single paragraph that would n't contain straight on lie or a twisted fact to suit their pov ( read : they tell just half-truth forgetting about other facts that completely invalidate argument they try to make ) . 
  not a single one . 
  why strange ? 
  it 's beautiful . 
  yep . 
  also a study on how it compares with rest of the world would be very appropriate . 
  if we want to draw as huge conclusions as `` massive human rights crisis '' then we should get a whole picture , not just tiny part of it . 
   * uk police forces and justice systems able to protect british citizens , unencumbered by ** unnecessary interference ** from the european institutions , including the european ** court of human rights ** i laughed hard . 
   * free movement to take up work , not free benefits   * ensuring britain is no longer subject to the concept of `` ever closer union '' , enshrined in the treaty , to which every eu country currently has to sign up . 
  cherry picking at it 's finest . 
  sorry cameron , but noone in eu with half a brain will agree to your list . 
   there is a wikipedia-article about this secession movement , that describes it as a minor party , that got 2 % in the last local elections . 
  look !, 
  it 's almost like it 's equivalent on crimea !, 
  only they got 4 % , so twice as much ... 
  i guess that 's why they have a prime minister now , and * venetian independence * does not . 
   we are talking about something that will not happen because european citizens will not tolerate a cut in their lifestyle for some foreign people far away . 
  on that basis : no war should ever happen . 
  cause it always leads to cutting a life style of many people . 
  russia is paying that price as we speak with stock market going down the drain and ruble reaching it 's record-low . 
   military escalation is out of the question . 
  russia is still a formidable nuclear power with a full deterrent . 
  there are ways to intervene militarily without creating a war . 
  both : russia and us got plenty of experience in fighting wars with other people 's hands . 
  and besides - it 's enough that western banks will stop renewing loans to russia . 
  if that happens - they 'll be on their knees before you notice . 
  though that 's something government ca n't really enforce on a private banks . 
  exactly . 
  sir , you just nailed the problem . 
  yep . 
  long history of mutual friendship  not many of these in the world . 
   not really , current govt in ukraine is trying to pass laws that would ban any other parties other than theirs bs . 
  they ai n't idiots . 
  neither eu nor us would ever allow something like that go through the parliament . 
  and both of these are the only reason why ukraine did n't collapse into total anarchy ( money makes miracles ) . 
   nothing that happens in ukraine right now is democratic . 
  it 's called post-revolutionary period - and it still goes in by far more democratic way than anything that happens right now on crimea . 
  they are pursuing to get elections ready for may . 
  ( unlike crimea they have enough brain not to do them this weekend and they want to ensure truly democratic process of elections ), 
   the first casualty of every conflict is the truth . 
  [ yep . 
  this sentence always was and always will be true . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20ebue/how_the_truth_is_made/ ), 
  relax . 
  waters around crimea got enough oil and gas to cover all of the expenses . 
  oh , and russians wo n't have to rent land for their naval bases from ukraine - which also saves a lot of money . 
  well , invasion has been going relatively calm so far - no mass-deportation of tatars , no death count in thousands , no nukes were used . 
  just buy solar charger . 
  yea , they are n't cheap , but you can charge almost everywhere . 
  it very often is . 
  i charged phone on the airport , in a bus ( imagine my shock finding out that the bus had 230v plugs as well as usb charging ports o_o ) , train/bus stations , some of the restaurants and fast foods offer charging as well . 
  really , finding a place to charge your gear is quite easy if you bother to ask around . 
  having a charger with yourself obviously helps ( but eg . 
  on the airports they often have their own charger that you can borrow if you 'll ask nicely ) . 
  duplicate : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20d7dt/europe_pushes_ahead_with_plans_to_make_all_phone/, 
  nope . 
  what happens is basically that you `` hide '' all your data , but nothing gets deleted from server . 
  i guess so . 
  at least for once eu countries did something with it 's military forces before us did :p, 
  you 're late americans .

  would n't work . 
  poles are allergic to aggressive propaganda , 
  that assumes results of this referendum ai n't already done . 
  beautiful western ideals that got nothing in common with reality in that tiny part of eastern europe . 
  tatars taking part in the vote would only give yet another argument in hands of kremlin . 
  regardless how they 'd vote . 
  yep .
