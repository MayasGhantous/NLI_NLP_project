  basically : someone encountered teenager banging on some shit with pl in his nickname - complained on a forums - people remembered and in next game noticed someone saying `` kurwa '' or something like that - on a next day you have 50 posts telling that poles are the devils of internet . 
  and usually ** it 's much easier to find out who is a pole ** than who is german , french , brit or irish - poles either use quite distinct nicknames or got pl tags ( guess poles like to talk to each other in games and it 's nice to know if there are others ) making whole thing much more obvious . 
  so even if brits are the most vulgar and painful players in online games - noone could really tell cause everyone speak english and they do n't use any distinctive nicknames nor gb tags . 
  it 's a word of the month in my ( british ) company . 
   the fact people legitimately confuse us with austria poland = holland . 
  poles = russians . 
  now beat that . 
  i guess i 'm not either , cause i never heard of it . 
  polish stereotype of scots is something like ... a wild , brave man surviving harsh environment in his house made of stone , chopping wood every morning ... wait , that 's braveheart . 
  their current army is badass as well , 
  nah , uk food is genuinely bad . 
  all the good food is in fact from india/greece/turkey / wherever else . 
  there are two things that i still ca n't get used to and it always tastes bad for me : * bread . 
  it 's not a bread . 
  it 's some weird kind of aerogel . 
  99.99 % of british bread is air . 
  might be good for insulation - not so much for eating . 
  * chicken . 
  british chicken got very weird after-taste that no other chicken i ever tried had . 
  and it 's like that pretty much everywhere - whatever you buy it in take away or a store and cook yourself - it 'll always be the same , weird taste . 
  british chicken does n't taste like a chicken . 
  poland [ joined awacs in 2006 ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/sid-aee12187-23632a53/natolive/news_22147.htm?selectedlocale=en ) and got regular air patrols with these planes for quite a while . 
  though now they 'll certainly intensify . 
  seems like everyone are preparing for a possible storm to come . 
  double post . 
  here 's previous one on exact same topic : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zyqwj/abandoned_spanish_villages_given_away_for_free/, 
   sure , but we could be doing much , much better if the government wanted people from every country in the world can say the same . 
   now it 's a monolith where the silesians or kaschubians are frowned upon if they dare to speak about their own rights , culture and autonomous regions . 
  must be a different poland somewhere . 
  cause the one i know is nothing alike and none of the silesians i know shares your opinion . 
  nah , we like ukrainians too , and many poles genuinely wish you very best and would love to see you follow path to eu and growth like we did . 
  hearing stories about corruption , attacks of armed groups , and some other crazy stuff going on behind our borders is really saddening , especially if you 'll remind yourself that in 1990 ukraine was roughly identical to poland in terms of wealth . 
  so ... yea , do n't think it 's only about russia . 
  successful and healthy , democratic ukraine is very much in poland 's best interests just like it is in yours . 
  more like : american freedom and `` ours '' . 
  they knew very well it 's all purely for american interests and bypassing american laws . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k-300p_bastion-p ) . 
  recorded in sevastopol . 
  my guess ? 
  1 ) negates advantages of having us or any other foreign pro-ukrainian navy on a black sea . 
  2 ) there 's not a chance for ukrainian ships to safely escape grasp of black sea fleet . 
  noone was forcing ukraine to do anything . 
  eu already had a trade deal with ukraine . 
  later on it asked ukraine if it 'd want to expand it - initially it agreed . 
  later on russia asked ukraine if it 'd want to join their customs union - it agreed . 
  ukrainian government put itself into the situation where they had to pick the best deal . 
  and tbh i do n't see anything wrong with that - they wanted to see offers of both parties and choose the one that serves their interests . 
  noone predicted consequences , but at the time when ukraine initialized negotiations with both parties - noone could . 
  was n't he a member of some other russian company before ? 
  the one that manages nord stream ? 
  i never can remember . 
  huh ? 
  noone mentioned anything of that sorts . 
  schr\u00f6der suggests that eu should n't force ukraine to pick this or that customs union - i 'm trying to explain why it was n't possible . 
  so ... where are these free villages again ? 
  all i see are prices anywhere between 100 000 euro and ... well ... few millions per property ( not a whole village ) . 
  catchy header , but that 's all i 'm afraid . 
   might become a stronk farming nation !!, 
  is n't it already ? 
   `` i wonder whether it was right to provide a culturally divided country like ukraine ago as an alternative : association with the eu or customs agreements with russia , '' schroeder said . 
  he would have appreciated it if the eu had made `` two-way '' possible . 
  afaik `` two-way '' is not possible because laws required by each customs union are incompatible with each other . 
  one one hand - many poles , including myself , got ( distant ) families in ukraine and would like neighbour country to fare well ( just like germans wanted , and still wants poland to fare well ) . 
  on the other hand - [ massacres of poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) are something that still terrifies many ( even more so as it 's [ not the first time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koliyivschyna ) ) , and seeing upa flags in euromaidan makes many poles much more cautious about ukraine 's future than they 're ready to admit . 
   poles believe they have a special message , even a special gift , to convey to those around the world who struggle for liberty and civil rights , and especially to ukraine . 
  so they say ... hm ... well , it was truth more during interwar period . 
  now it 's mostly laughed at when someone mentions it . 
  many jokes were made on that topic when former polish president visited georgia during russia-georgia war in 2008 . 
  `` now '' ? 
  it never was legitimate . 
  yea , sorry mate . 
  i 'm new to reddit . 
  the true irony is that behavior of russia as well as crimean pm got all symptoms of the fascist government . 
   svoboda also pushed neo-nazi and other radical groups out the party , [ 40 ] distancing itself from its neofascist past while retaining the support of extreme nationalists . 
  second episode after [ marking of the houses ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zu03v/tatars_in_crimea_are_getting_giant_x_markings_on/ ) . 
  what 's next ? 
  and russia as well as crimean so-called-prime minister accuse ukrainian parliament for fascism and lack of tolerance . 
  so that 's the tolerance according to russians ? 
  a little bit communist is still too communist . 
  yep . 
  pretty much . 
  but imho major reason for why it 's complete bs is that everything changes very rapidly . 
  today we see [ ukrainian army moving into crimea ] ( https://twitter.com/euromaidanpr/status/442674694034960384 ) while few days ago many people thought that international observers will be allowed and referendum might be fair and just - today probably noone has any illusions about it anymore and conflict is going to escalate with increasing presence of ukrainian army on a peninsula . 
   i think it 's just common sense that we keep armed forced tied to nation states to protect the interests of each sovereign nation within europe , but that we develop frameworks for efficient co-operation so that we can work together on a case-by-case basis . 
  that 's how the situation looks like right now . 
  eubg is the framework for cooperation on military level . 
  yep . 
  without permission from uk government there would be no referendum on that matter . 
  that went easily . 
  yep . 
  it 's one of two or three in an entire europe if memory serves me well . 
  i think polish fm got notified that ukrainian army will be moving in to crimea ( it 's happening right now ) so consulate was moved out of the area as no one really knows where it will go from now on . 
  there might be a real war there now that both armies are about to encounter each other in strength . 
  other than that consulate also reported that there were threats of setting it under fire if they would n't move out . 
  so certainly it was n't safe any more to stay there . 
  ^ posted as a reminder for those who still have an illusion that russia will allow any international observers on crimea or that everything they do there got something to deal with democracy or peace . 
   you know who ate sugar ? 
  sugar is a nazi population control device . 
  let 's not forget that [ nazis loved chocolate ] ( http://nowiknow.com/the-nazis-chocolate-bomb/ ) . 
   they 're not paid and they are n't soldiers , just protestors .
