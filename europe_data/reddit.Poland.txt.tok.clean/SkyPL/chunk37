  it 's * de facto * invasion . 
  however if ukrainian verkhovna rada would invite european forces as a peacekeepers - we have every right being that and ca n't be accused of invasion . 
  ( that 's a huge if - first of all i doubt they ever will , and secondly i doubt eu countries would do that ), 
  still does n't change the fact that situation in scotland does n't have anything to deal with situation on crimea . 
   seems like the us is already starting to court ukraine into it 's arms . 
  well , better late than never . 
   kerry traveling there and the one billion dollar loan deal to start seems really nice . 
  nothing comparing to the loan from eu . 
  11 billion euro that eu gives is what ? 
  over 15 billion usd ? 
  so americans give 1/15th of what eu does . 
   it 's pretty much guaranteed that they will become nato soon huh ? 
  define `` soon '' . 
  ukraine wo n't join nato unless it satisfies requirements . 
  if ukraine allows russia to keep crimea it can forget about nato membership ( countries with occupied territories are not allowed joining nato , and none of the nato members will acknowledge crimean secession ), 
  exactly . 
  period to cool down , let ukraine have it 's own elections first , let people have at least a bit of taste to see how they 're doing , let them get some more information than just russian tv brainwashing , let russian troops go back where they 're suppose to be , give people some space and time to relax . 
  then we might talk about fair referendum . 
  after weeks of brainwashing from russian tv being denided of any alternative sources of information ? 
  i doubt they can make an objective decision . 
  and the whole matter of international observers is still doubtful - these were allowed in russia as well , yet election fraud did happen . 
  international observers are not an ultimate answer to everything . 
  vote wo n't be about creating independent crimea . 
  it 's either that crimea remains in ukraine or that it 'll join russia . 
   similar in some ways to scotland . 
  sorry , but situation in crimea got nothing to deal with scotland . 
  scotland was seeking independence for centuries . 
  majority of current inhabitants of crimea were brought there in 1944 by stalin from russia . 
  and even despite of this - surveys made before russian intervention shown that majority of crimeans does n't want to see crimea in russia . 
  today though outcome of referendum is clear : crimea will vote for russia . 
  only it 'll vote surrounded by russian army , with russian soldiers and russians brought by moscow to crimea taking part in a vote as well . 
  as someone said on reddit : now 150 % of crimeans vote for russia . 
  of course . 
  they also often were fighting against very inferior equipment - especially east from german border . 
  still though achievements and strategy of erich hartmann were really impressive . 
  i wish allies would have equally brilliant pilots . 
  1,404 combat missions and he never was shot down . 
   just like yanukovich did to the protesters ? 
  yep . 
  and i never was a big fan of protesters taking over government buildings . 
  protests on maidan - yes . 
  paralizing government - no . 
   let 's be honest here , if the crimea people want to go russia , let them bloody do it and let 's get over with it . 
  problem is that we ca n't tell if they want to . 
  before russian intervention - they did n't . 
  there are few other surveys done there over the time , ukrainian government did similar one as well before russian intervention . 
  haha , did n't see this one  . 
  i knew they were great , but did n't know they were that good !, 
  armed russians surrounded kosovian authonomy parliment , imposed pro-russian * prime minister * from a minority party and moved thousands of troops on a territory of kosovo while at the same time forbidding osce observers an access to crimea ? 
   however if people want full independence then that satisfies it too people ... which people ? 
  russians that live there since 1944 ? 
  russians and russian soldiers that were brought there last week ? 
  and how they can judge anything if they get pumped by russian propaganda every day through tv and newspapers ? 
  [ they just blocked access to ukrainian tv ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/mar/06/ukraine-censorship ) and [ kicked out osce observers ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/06/ukraine-crisis-osce-mission-idusw8n0lt00z20140306 ) . 
  so how exactly do you see any chance for self-determination ? 
  with referendum in little bit over a week and people forced to vote with russian soldiers watching their backs ? 
  great western ideas have very little to deal with russian definition of democracy on crimea . 
  go , educate yourself how exactly sergey aksenov become crimean * prime minister * . 
  oh , and one fun fact : [ in may 2013 ** 53 % ** of crimeans thought that crimea should ** remain as it is in ukraine ** with current form of autonomy , ** 10 % ** wanted autonomy to be ** changed ** , but crimea ** still kept within ukraine ** , while only ** 23 % ** wanted crimea to ** join russia ** ] ( http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2013%20october%207%20survey%20of%20crimean%20public%20opinion,%20may%2016-30,%202013.pdf ) ( page 17 ) . 
  read this : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zpjpf/crimea_will_have_referendum_on_1603_about/cfvu9xi and a bit of this : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zjzff/ukrainians_persecuted_russian_minority_by_testing/ - there are more examples of people being moved around to make `` shows '' for russian tv . 
  just look around reddit - we had at least 3 topics with other examples . 
   so a higher standard of democracy is not welcome when it does not benefit your political views ? 
  my political views got nothing to deal with that . 
  just a current situations in crimea . 
  another lecture : http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/03/222988.htm  there is safety nets existing to prevent voter fraud , independent investigations from the un etc. 
  un tried to send osce observers , it did n't end well : http://en.itar-tass.com/world/722275  go crawl into the cave you came from , why should we take you seriously / u/skypl when you argue like a prepubecent child . 
  how about you go educate yourself on a topic instead of pointing fingers on me ? 
  oh , and thanks for showing me how `` prepubecent child '' is arguing in your very own post . 
  i never said it 's innovative . 
  just that it 's quite a surprising move , 
  weak up . 
  russians yesterday kicked out international observers from crimea . 
  and right to self-determination can be satisfied by autonomy - autonomy that crimeans already have . 
  russians never called on un charter to justify any of their actions on crimea , so stop this bs talk you keep on blindly repeating over and over again stalking my posts . 
  oh jesus , another guy who blindly believes russian agenda . 
  of course these are ukrainians . 
  of course . 
   sweden in swedish elections , do n't apply swedish standards to russian politics . 
  ever . 
  random fun fact : the most successful fighter pilot ever was ... german [ erich hartmann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erich_hartmann ) . 
  his achievements dwarf these of allied or soviet pilots . 
  for a matter a fact : top 3 to the best world war 2 pilots served in luftwaffe . 
  achievements of polish pilots are n't particularly impressive comparing to many other aces . 
   once they get away with crimea expect referenda to be called by the local gov in those places . 
  `` those places '' meaning what ? 
  if you mean abhasia and south ossetia - their government already consider themselves independent . 
  why would they make a referendum on anything ? 
  certainly you are right . 
  never the less central government acknowledged by every other country in the world as well as all of ukrainian ambassadors ( which were nominated by former government ) is in place working , and police operates all across ukraine back again . 
  putin can say what he wants - fact is that majority of current ukrainian parliament is made of former pms - that includes people from yanukovich own party that voted for his removal from the office . 
  yep . 
  and last big russian action - abhasia and south ossetia - ended up with basically only russia acknowledging existence of these new `` countries '' . 
   obama has always said that if russia goes down this route he will make them pay a very heavy price for it , and i believe he really means it . 
  so do i. 
  or what - they 'll start shooting ? 
  it 'd be the beginning of an end for russian presence in crimea . 
  as per wikipedia :  the permanent representatives of the united states , united kingdom and france presented their opinion that the kosovo case is sui generis in nature and could not be perceived as a precedent . 
  we 've been going through this . 
  you obviously do n't understand what it means . 
  ** crimean autonomy already satisfies un charter ** and ** ukrainian law and constitution stands in perfect agreement with un law ** .
