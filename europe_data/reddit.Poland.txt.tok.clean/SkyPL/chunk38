  heck , you should read the article you linked to yourself . 
   however , the charter and other resolutions did ** not insist on full independence ** as the best way of obtaining self-government , nor did they include an enforcement mechanism . 
  and  the principle does not state how the decision is to be made , or what the outcome should be , whether it be independence , federation , protection , ** some form of autonomy ** or even full assimilation . 
  you must finally realize that what you think is right does n't have anything to deal with international law . 
  if russians would think that un charter is being broken by ukrainian government ( which holds the same position on that matter as i do ) they 'd exploit it to it 's full extend - these are russians , they are experts in exploiting every paragraph of international law to their own advantage . 
  and then they go out of these meetings and each of them takes a different stance on the issue . 
   i do n't think they would be able to arrest those occupying government buildings without using force . 
  they have a right to use force . 
  it 's a police operating within borders of it 's own country . 
  they key part there is `` police '' - no special forces , no military , just use police for that . 
  make everything as legal and clean as it possibly gets . 
  that 's what police is suppose to do . 
   they would n't surrender to ukrainian police force , as they do n't recognize their legitimacy . 
  noone has to surrender . 
  just take back the buildings . 
  russian police overwhelmed with numbers and batons protesters against intervention in moscow and somehow noone cried because of that . 
  and they most likely got spies in ukrainian military . 
  sure . 
  never the less - they wo n't shoot , not with eyes of an entire world looking at them . 
  russians do n't want full-out war , not just yet . 
  as long as ukrainians do n't kill anyone - russians will sit tight and look as angry as they possibly can . 
  with what ? 
  their own trucks ? 
  just drive through the fence if there is such need . 
  it 's their own base . 
  or if for whatever obscure reason fence must stay intact - use helicopters . 
  ukraine got plenty of them . 
  it 's unthinkable that hundreds of people are held ( in fact ) hostage with no access to food and limited reserves of water . 
   what is the international law ? 
  i was only aware of self-representation ? 
  according to un the need of self-representation can be satisfied by an autonomy - autonomy that crimeans already have , even a bigger one than many other minorities in europe - they have their own parliament . 
  let 's not forget about it . 
  yea , i know about it , linked to that article few times myself , only problem is that this is mostly a vapour . 
  everything is tied together when the need comes , so it 's real `` rapid response '' capability is doubtful to say at least . 
  not to mention the fact that it never took part in anything else than occasional exercises . 
  not even stupid escort duties . 
   if this is legal it 's not . 
  not according to ukrainian law , nor international law . 
   if this is fair it 's not fair either . 
  russians have been brining civilians and soldiers to crimea all the time during last two weeks . 
  all of them would vote . 
  and that 's enough to alter the results in whichever way russia wants . 
  next days will be crucial . 
  west got time to act till [ 16th of this month ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zpjpf/crimea_will_have_referendum_on_1603_about/ ) . 
  if nothing happens - it 'll be abhasia and south ossetia all over again - states recognized by russia and 4 meaningless countries on the other edge of the globe . 
  `` truxtun 's operations in the black sea were scheduled '' i love how everyone insist that everything was scheduled . 
  this referendum is illegal . 
  according to ukrainan constitution referendums can not be made on a secession from a country . 
  [ and yet referendum still will be there ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zpjpf/crimea_will_have_referendum_on_1603_about/ ) . 
  seems like the results of it are already done by russians and their separatist puppets . 
  just when you thought that russians ca n't surprise you any more ... [ cruiser description on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_cruiser_ochakov ) . 
  well then , i guess they got some time to buy it back if they really do care about this symbol . 
   not anymore than regular oil drilling . 
  should have seen oil drilling in russia . 
  that fucks up planet much more than fracking anywhere in the world . 
  so far russians are paying for that . 
  ruble is rescued from going down the drain only by russians pumping enormous amount of money into the economy . 
  and all that money de facto goes to usd and eur as investors move away from ruble . 
  excellent list . 
  funny how many of these points were already touched by [ samantha power in un ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/samantha-power-russia-ukraine-un-security-council-2014-3 ) before putin even made his speech . 
   the problem with events such as ukraine is that people expect the eu to act like a superstate , and then criticise it for not being able to do such . 
  well , one good think that might come out of it is that we 'll have some real eu army capable of actually doing something . 
  or at least : a real eu rapid response capability . 
  perhaps it 'll also do something for highlighting the need of both : energetic independence and common eu foreign policy . 
  cause right now as far as it goes for talking with russia and ukraine : there 's no eu , each country plays their tiny games on their own . 
  imho eu leaders and/or ministers should gather together , discuss matter , and then make any talks with either side only through eu representatives . 
  cause this crisis is facing whole europe , not just poland or lithuania . 
  yep . 
  my thoughts . 
  perhaps during next generation something like that might happen , but certainly not this one . 
  people that sit currently in the government are way too focused on their own nationalities to think about broad , world-wide picture . 
  and the younger of current politicians often go into nationalistic and euro-sceptic tone which is even worse . 
  perhaps the people to come after them will have a vision of europe as a single , leading world-wide player . 
   unsinkable aircraft carrier ? 
  never heard of those before militarized islands or peninsulas are sometimes referred to as an `` unsinkable aircraft carriers ''  so why not try politics first ? 
  but they are trying it . 
  only russia denies . 
  today there was suppose to be meeting between russian and ukrainian ambassadors - russia denied . 
  hopefully they 'll keep on trying and wo n't just give up crimean in a name of eu being left alone . 
   now they certainly ca n't ever get crimea if they lose it . 
  loose it ? 
  so far russians are sending more and more troops onto peninsula . 
  they have n't lost anything yet . 
  not even made their troops step back from ukrainian bases on ukrainian soil . 
  russian government never was too good with logic . 
  they do n't protect even their own citizens who protest against events on crimea . 
  and yea - they used it as a pretext . 
  heck : even some of the people on reddit adopt kremlin rhetoric and accuse euromaidan for supporting terrorism . 
   russia declares yarosh a terrorist . 
  they do [ because of that ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/world/721607 ) . 
   their movement rejects anti-semitism and xenophobia and will not tolerate it . 
  smart guy . 
  otherwise noone in west would give ukraine a single $ / $ . 
  i already did my part few weeks ago . 
  it takes a while but imho is really worth going through ( especially by people complaining that eu laws are `` bad '' for whatever reason - there 's your chance to have voice heard ) . 
  afaik `` kiev '' is just the name in english . 
  just like warszawa in english is warsaw . 
  yea , perhaps source of it is russian , but does n't change the fact that commonly accepted english spelling is kiev . 
  [ seem like wikipedia and oxford english dictionary agrees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiev#cite_note-15 ), 
  it 's just a prototype .
