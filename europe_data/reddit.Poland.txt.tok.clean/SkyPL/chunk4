  you can try reading [ history of the internet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_internet ) till chapter 7 , you will see just how complex this matter is . 
   show me at least one 10/10 polish girl picture . 
  you know that it 's a request that 's impossible to fulfil ? 
  every person got a different taste and likes different kind of beauty . 
  `` 10/10 '' is extremely subjective and noone can show you pictures you 'd call 10/10 just like that . 
   a putsch source ? 
   sponsored by the eu and the us ( no , it 's not a conspiracy theory , the us have admitted source ? 
  fyi : so did ukraine . 
  they actually trade by far more with russian than germany does .

  bear .

  obviously . 
   hope the soldiers get arrested polish news writes that they were arrested . 
  beware : story posted by tass , kremlin propaganda tube . 
  [ nato-russia exercise gap ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap ), 
  [ the shrodinger 's putin website ] ( http://laaake.com/ ) confirms . 
   kremlin 's troll army is quiet : sign of a coup no , they simply stop receiving commands from their overlords . 
  everyone could use a break from time to time . 
  yes , it does . 
  being able to mobilize few thousand troops in days notice for training is really impressive feat , and their combined arms performance really seems to have an edge over what nato is capable of . 
  russians might try shock & awe tactics - and they would probably win a lot of ground before nato armies would even weak up ... 
  i really wish nato would start performing similar large scale exercises . 
  last time we had anything involving over 40 000 troops was back during the cold war . 
  russians meanwhile made an exercises with over 150 000 troops twice in last 3 years . 
  they are definitely way more capable than during georgian war .

  crusade time !, 
  [ teutonic order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teutonic_order ) is still rollin ' , so are [ few other orders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_order_%28monastic_society%29#list_of_military_orders ) , i 'm sure we can bring back the spirit of the good old days !, 
   besides , nobody bought into the whole rebel thing in the first place some of my british friends disagree . 
  and plenty of different media in europe do as well . 
  only problem is that eu generals got relatively little experience comparing to the us . 
  russians on the other hand can not only match but most likely exceed us in terms of how well trained and prepared their staff is . 
  [ the gap in exercises alone is enormous ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/en/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap ) . 
  as far as i share your hopes - i think that military hardware alone is n't enough , and europe got very little beyond hardware and pure number of troops . 
  unit cohesion , strategy , rapid response capabilities , rapid decision making , this stuff just is n't here . 
  and all of this plays a major role that can not be underestimated . 
  perhaps , but it 's not far off from the truth . 
   although this would be a great opportunity to put an eu institution somewhere else than brussels . 
  maybe towards the east , poland could be an option in the future . 
  last time i checked trend was to minimize bureaucracy and move as many institutions to brussels as possible , not the other way around . 
  said mr. * independent * faroe islands . 
  oh the irony . 
   maximum fishing quota 's will be lower then currently ( to preserve a healthy fish population ) that does not mean that they are going to loose the industry . 
  it will shrink to the sustainable level . 
  keeping industry as it is will lead to loosing it completely as there wo n't be any more fishes to catch at this rate . 
  and the sales to the foreign nations is just fear mongering . 
  polish eurosceptics used that as an argument before poland joined eu and yet somehow our fishing industry is still largely in polish hands . 
  i 'm quite sure that russia is cheating on that image and takes into account it 's coastline in asia , not just europe . 
  but ... but these are not a regular rebels . 
  these are novorossiya rebels !, 
  from the interview it looks like he was n't fighting inside of the debaltsevo cauldron . 
  but i guess that he thinks that a proper assault and support from outside of the cauldron could save the soldiers inside . 
  but instead all they got were few small units , mostly just an infantry without proper anti-armor weapons . 
  no armored assault , no artillery support , even though ukrainians had both in proximity . 
  the same portal wrote ( again in polish ) a [ detailed analysis of the battle for debaltseve airport ] ( http://www.defence24.pl/analiza_dlaczego-ukraincy-utracili-lotnisko-w-doniecku-analiza-taktycznego-poziomu-dzialan-bojowych ) ( which was a prologue to the cauldron ) pointing out that the major mistakes ukrainians made were in command structures , poor utilization of available resources and lack of specialized equipment ( such as night vision , navigation , comms ) . 
  which seems to be matching this interview in a few points . 
  good interview . 
  [ related one with ukrainian major ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2z4co7/they_dont_let_us_fight_ukraine_without_commanders/ ), 
  for that matter - probably more important than being a soldier is , as pretty much everyone can hold a gun while relatively very very few people got decent medical training . 
  nope , it 's during the operation in persian gulf . 
  grom has a capability to serve in various environments - sea , land , air , urban , arctic , you get the point . 
  but i changed photo to make it less confusing . 
  well , there 's spetsnaz too ... the guys famous for beslan massacre . 
  wrong . 
  guy on a right is delta force instructor , guy on a left is one of the first grom soldiers ever . 
  it 's a photograph taken after the training , so he does n't wear full outfit . 
  pixelated guy is delta force instructor ( mislabeled ) , the other guy is one of the first ever grom soldiers - he served as a sniper . 
  photo was made during a first exercise grom had with delta force back in '90s . 
  i found some polish description of that photo . 
  it 's with delta force instructor during the first exercise grom had with them in '90s . 
  soldier in question served as a sniper ( yes , it 's not a sniper rifle , special forces are required to be capable with all kinds of weapons ) . 
  [ currently unit looks more like that ] ( https://i.imgur.com/s2bdkg1.jpg ) or [ that ( vid ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brv4j8hbw90 ), 
   the whole country would grind to a halt . 
  ... they grind to halt as soon as it [ starts snowing ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/6935965/britain-paralysed-by-snow-and-freezing-weather.html ) . 
  like : 15cm of snow ...  we could see up to 15cm ( 6ins ) or more in some parts of hampshire and dorset . 
  so ... erm ... that means that invasion on poland would lead to the identical events as annual snowfall does ... that 's depressing . 
  that [ rosomak ] ( http://www.mkd.mk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/rosomakafp450.jpeg ) b ), 
  i 'm not sure you want doing that - [ last time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_air_forces_in_france_and_great_britain ) we 've come in handy . 
  mogherini & her team in action . 
  somehow i 'm not surprised . 
  rt is the prime example . 
  sputnik international is it 's new offspring . 
  from news agencies there 's tass or interfax . 
  in general pretty much every [ russian media channel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_of_russia ) should be double if not triple-checked these days . 
  from non-russian prime examples would be daily mail , fox news , bild , everything that is a tabloid . 
  that 's true . 
  but he actually works and works hard - which is something you ca n't tell about many other ministers in current government  . 
  yea , he is actually quite decent . 
  far from perfect , obviously , but he happens to be one of a better defense ministers in last 25 years . 
  engaged in what he does and actually making military cogs move . 
  even mps from opposition parties tend to praise him from time to time . 
  that 's precisely what russia counts for . 
  that people will be dumb enough to say things like that and in effect - nato will be dissolved . 
   in practical terms , that would mean attacking the invading russian forces so they said in regards of budapest memorandum . 
  and now that paper is worth as much as the one i use to wipe my ass . 
  i 'm quite sure that at a very least all central and eastern european countries will mount a joined defense - regardless which one of them is attacked . 
  we share similar history in regards of russia and we know that if one falls - other will follow . 
  baltic is not a `` large lake '' .
