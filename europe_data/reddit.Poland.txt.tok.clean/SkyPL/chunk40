  yet they did n't . 
  why ? 
  because ** no un law was broken ** and ** no right was abused ** . 
  i highly recommend you to read [ samanta power speech in un ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/samantha-power-russia-ukraine-un-security-council-2014-3 ) - it will shed you some more light on the issue . 
   no , the ukrainian parliament does not need to agree , under the un charter any group of people have the right to self determination , it must be supported by the un and all countries within the un , and ukraine is a signatory to the un charter . 
  and as such it 's satisfying this un charter by granting undisturbed right to wide autonomy of crimea . 
   why would russia have to abandon the sevastopol base ? 
  i never said that they would have to nor meant to imply that . 
   putin seems to have a bad habit of doing things without thinking first . 
  oh , quite contrary . 
  he had everything well thought . 
  that 's exactly whey you see the results you do : crimea basically is in russian hands right now , and crimean parliament become russian puppet with illegal `` prime minister '' . 
  to be fair - this fact got very long historical basis . 
  russians were always pushing quite hard on electronics and it is simply a next stage . 
  their superpower ambitions and wanting to be independent of us in every possible way certainly also played a role . 
  no slightest idea . 
  i do n't know almost anything at all about radio maria . 
  though afaik jews are higher on their `` to-hate '' list than islamists . 
   says the guy who downvotes all of my posts whilst having a tantrum ? 
  do i ? 
   so do you believe that catalonia should be forced to stay within spain if madrid does not agree to a binding referendum ? 
  i know nothing about catalonia co i prefer not to comment on that . 
  how about this : if crimean way to referendum would follow the steps of scottish , and be done in a way where lack of any external pressure would be reassured and both : ukrainian government and crimean parliament ( not just illegally chosen so-called crimean prime minister ) would agree on it like they did in great britain - i would totally support it happily look how they , crimeans , vote independently on their own future . 
   un enshrines the right to self determination in their charter , stop repeating false information . 
  un never gave right for any region to secede from it 's parent country without it agreeing . 
  the need for self-determination is already satisfied by crimean autonomy and un charter stays in complete agreement with that . 
  stop implying that they only way of satisfying self-determination is secession from ukraine . 
  it 's not . 
   it 's called self-determination . 
  and we 're back home ...  as long as they forge their own destiny in the direction you want them to . 
   what ? 
  you even know what 's going on there ? 
  cause the more i read the more certain i am that you have no slightest idea . 
   you 'd grow out of it as you mature in your ideas . 
  parenting . 
   or do you believe they should be forced to stay within their larger states with threat of force as well ? 
  british government agreed for scotland to have referendum and set up conditions for it to happen . 
  both parties cooperated years for it to happen and there was ** no ** external pressure what so ever . 
  also scotts live in their land for centuries , not 70 years or so . 
  and if some of them think that they 're russians and they belong to russia - there is a country that they can go to , unlike scotland which does n't have it 's own country . 
  that 's radically different situation than the one in ukraine for these and many , many other reasons , some of which already been mentioned . 
  out there foreign government is the only one that legitimized referendum prepared by separatist minority ( yes , people you see now on tv were from a minor party in crimean parliament - there was no record what so ever of crimean parliament even gathering to vote on said referendum ) . 
  and right now noone can guarantee truthfulness of it 's results , not even un . 
   gee , i bet those tartar communities in poland would have something to say about that you xenophobic git . 
  yea ... years of conflicts back in the day . 
  but for some short period we managed to get along to some great effect . 
  right now there 's just a small minority in podlaskie voivodeship - and most poles are n't even aware of that . 
  currently pretty much whole political right-wing is anti-islamist , with maxtv ( most popular polish right-wing youtube `` tv '' ) being primary example of radical anti-islamists . 
   if the crimeans wish to leave ukraine , forcing them to stay is oppression of the people and suppression of their wishes . 
  i wish upper silesia would join germany . 
  so . . assuming i can find enough people to vote on it - i 'm being oppressed and my wishes are suppressed by the government ? 
  sorry , you really need to learn how the world works . 
  cause it 's definitely not as you think it does . 
   it 's sad that you ca n't understand that and believe it 's okay to not allow them to forge their own destiny . 
  they forge their own destiny through crimean parliment since 1992 . 
   yet you wo n't extend the same courtesy to those in the east . 
  western ukraine did n't separate from eastern just because they did n't like government . 
  they chose to dispose it and get a new one . 
  crimeans are free to take part in forming new government just like every other region is . 
  territorial integrity of ukraine or any other country is something no region can tamper with without agreement from said country government . 
  you allow that and you open pandora 's box in entire europe . 
  suddenly law means nothing everywhere . 
  there are no troops with russian markings , no trucks with russian markings , no ifvs with russian markings anywhere near any ukrainian bases . 
  yet somehow there are troops with standard russian-army issue equipment , professional military training , and heavy equipment used by russian army . 
  your choice which version you want to believe - russian troops or pro-russian troops ( aka `` militia '' or `` troops without markings '' ) . 
  wikipedia : best source of russian propaganda . 
  lol, 
   that 's not what self-determination means , i think you are completely clueless yourself what it means . 
  even wikipedia agrees with me : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination  the principle does not state how the decision is to be made , or what the outcome should be , whether it be independence , federation , protection , ** some form of autonomy ** or even full assimilation . 
   actually , yes they can , the un charter is very clear about the principle of self-determination . 
  yes , and one of the ways to satisfy that need is autonomy - autonomy that crimean ** already have ** and ukrainian government ** wants to extend ** by it 's own initiative . 
  my position : * no region in the world can decide on it 's own to which country can it belong * still stands truth . 
  un charter never allowed any secessions . 
   i 'm not even going to address your point about `` real '' crimeans because it 's just a preposterous and desperate position to take . 
  \\* facepalm \\* if truth is * preposterous and desperate * then i have nothing more to say here . 
  oh ... so that 's why uk embargoes sierra leone . 
  cause '' * a significant section of the market is involved * '' . 
  makes sense . 
  maybe i do ... ah , these nuances . 
   if you think war is that black and white never is , never was . 
  noone denies that . 
  you read way too much in my post . 
  4 paragraphs trying to respond on a single sentence is a slight overkill in implying me words i never said . 
   feel happy we even had a damn treaty and even came to help you you came to help us ? 
  last time i checked : ussr was the one marching through poland killing nazis . 
  on the other hand i quite specifically remember poles helping british soldiers , be it during battle of england or various campaigns in continental europe . 
  just in the end to give up poland in russian hands to the occupation that we finally ended ourselves in 1990 . 
  highly recommend reading through this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal . 
  one highlight if you really think uk was so great for poland in 1939 :  * france and britain did not launch a full land attack on germany , and did not declare war on the soviet union when it invaded poland on 17 september 1939 ; contrary to the terms of the alliances with france and britain *, 
   that 's still denying their right to self-determination no region in the world can decide on it 's own to which country can it belong . 
  it always needs to be agreed with central government , and ukraine ca n't afford loosing crimea . 
  also : according to all of the international treaties - including these signed by russia itself , like budapest memorandum - crimea belongs to ukraine . 
  majority of russian-speaking crimeans were brought there by stalin middle xxth century ( 1944 ) just to have peninsula re-assigned to ukrainian ssr soon after ( 1954 ) . 
  `` real '' crimeans are crimean tatars that lived there before infamous 1944 and some of them started to move back when ukraine become independent . 
  they do n't want to see crimea back in russian hands no matter what - due to all the pain they suffered from russian hands through the history . 
  only problem is that they 're at the moment minority on crimea . 
  so what - freshly imported russians are about to determine a fate of peninsula populated on stalin 's order ? 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
   if it could be proven to be free it ca n't . 
  that 's the problem i try to point out through all these posts .
