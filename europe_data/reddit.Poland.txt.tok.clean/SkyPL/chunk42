   also that would pretty much start a war . 
  what war ? 
  there 's no russian troops on ukrainian soil , and ukrainians got a right to invite whoever they want to their own military bases . 
  diplomacy can do miracles . 
  russians are doing one diplomatic miracle right now - no reason why we ca n't either . 
   lithuania has never met nato 's minimum expenditure target . 
  it never as requirement for anything . 
   instead of relying on the us , uk , and france so much . 
  more like us period . 
  besides : truth is always very complex in matters like that . 
  european union made people think that peace will last forever , so governments were very reluctant in increasing military spendings . 
  after all : who will invade country in a middle of europe ? 
  well - we got an answer this week . 
  soviets would regain poland and defeat germany regardless of what uk did . 
  you see - many simulations were made over a years and the only effect western forces got was speeding up the whole process . 
  germany could n't defeat ussr no matter what . 
  ussr would defeat germany eventually taking over what they wanted or even more . 
  you entered the war to secure your own asses more than anyone else 's in continental europe . 
  and that as a bright decision cause otherwise you 'd be a lone island next to gigantic * cccp * text on a map . 
  oh , and let 's not forget that poles help you win the war by far more than you helped poland during and after ww2 . 
  interesting . 
  polish opposition been fighting between each other and all against government for last year or so with an enormous intensity , but now they 're united more than ever and stand one next to each other praising compliments and calling to stuff . 
  [ seems like gives some effects ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zgxcr/poland_conducts_military_exercises_near_ukrainian/ ) . 
  only armies of eu are over 2 years ahead of russians in terms of technology . 
  oh , and then there are nukes . 
  and usa behind our backs . 
  russians are not stupid . 
  they 're just testing grounds . 
  if west will allow them to take crimea - they will . 
  but they wo n't go for an open conflict with any member of nato . 
  perhaps in 10 year or so they 'll be ready for that , but they are not now . 
  russia is n't either . 
  usa is . 
  and russians wo n't use nukes over some tiny piece of land in another country , not with all the nuclear arsenal stationed in europe . 
  they are just pushing borders - it 's nato and eu role to stop them . 
  it wo n't escalate to nuclear war . 
  russians are way too smart for that . 
  they use fear as their ally , but if west will make some deceive movements - they will tone down . 
  a miracle of nearly whole country supporting you ( yep , ukrainians do n't like russians on their own land ) and several night-ops helicopters . 
  pretty much the same how critical oil infrastructure was taken over during iraq war - heck : even polish grom special forces took part in that using very similar methods . 
  turkey says hello !, 
  nato got more than enough power in there . 
  turkish navy alone is a behemoth comparing to russian black sea fleet . 
  i there anything they wo n't deny ? 
  [ corpse got tired ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bhwluj4ceaedhjn.jpg:large ) - only on russian tv . 
  cause jet engines are best in blowing up a balloons . 
  hard to decide . 
  if they 'll bring flamethrowers - it 's nazi . 
  if they 'll bring trains and start sending them full to siberia - it 's soviets . 
  ( inappropriate joke is inappropriate ), 
  [ stronk enough ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_armed_forces#equipment ) . 
   and more fancy than hungarian , 
  yea . 
  we imagine them right now making poles feel much safer while russians conduct military exercises in kaliningrad at the same time conquering parts of ukraine . 
  feels almost like a real thing . 
  yea , everyone thought the same about pretty much every conflict out there . 
  syria being most recent highlight . 
  millions of people , thousands of videos posted every day , yet noone recorded chemical attack on civilians . 
  it seems ** [ poland got bigger balls than i expected ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zgxcr/poland_conducts_military_exercises_near_ukrainian/ ) ** ... ( links to the military exercise news on polish-russian border , not a picture of balls ), 
  [ you mean : on a bear ? 
  ] ( http://static1.fjcdn.com/comments/this+is+another+option+_eef621dd8b2d78adb9f84a385d1476f3.jpg ), 
  merkel makes a phone calls . 
  mostly . 
  [ hollande made a speech 2 days ago ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/2014/03/01/ukraine-hollande-appelle-poutine-a-eviter-tout-recours-a-la-force_983893 ) after talking with polish president . 
   they 'll lose most of their trade with russia , belarus and kazakhstan so either way ukraine is going to suffer . 
  russia ca n't really afford messing trade with ukraine just like ukraine ca n't afford messing trade with russia . 
  these two countries are very , very important trade partners for each other . 
  even in a face of war they wo n't embargo each other . 
  ( unless honor clouds maths ), 
   exactly the same time , march 2nd ... russians got timing ...  so we had our turn , i 'm afraid it 's you guys next . 
  damn . 
   with the whole world watching , through the eyes of very , very few . 
  the fever reporters are in there the easier it gets to manipulate information . 
  and crimea is really large - for an example reporters never were there to witness surrounding of any base , they always came in after the event - so `` creating '' and event is really easy . 
  yes , each day coverage increases , but it 's still very easy to fabricate information . 
  and even if someone is in there to record the lie - it might be already too late and too few will believe . 
  as i said earlier - each unit surrounded by russian `` unmarked '' forces was offered a surrender . 
  but they did not . 
  that 's just a character of slavic nations - we do n't step down under threats . 
  in the end though it really depends on a kiev . 
  if government decides to give it up - so the army stationed there will . 
   if the russians did n't back down after that it could be all out war by tomorrow morning . 
  there 's a lot of `` ifs '' in that whole situation . 
  if it 's even truth , if west does nothing , if russians decide to open fire , if press will be there to show it all around the world ... 
  i guess we 'll see tomorrow . 
   whoever starts this war will be easily and definitively identified . 
  that 's a wild statement . 
  you must know that all of what you listed works both ways : stuff can be proved or manipulated . 
  western ukraine will be left alone for sure . 
  still does n't change the fact that a big part of it is in a threat of being annexed . 
  and guess what ? 
  all of the essential military industry is on the east side . 
  without it and crimea ( what means no gas discounts ) remaining ukraine will be just a shell of former self . 
  moldova will be more likely target ? 
  i mean : it 's not a member of nato nor eu , so they can do crimea all over again . 
  oh - and 9 % of population identifies itself as russian , so they can use exactly the same excuse they do here . 
  somehow missed that part . 
   thanks for pointing it out . 
  no doubt !, 
  reactive armor was created to counter just one type of weapons .
