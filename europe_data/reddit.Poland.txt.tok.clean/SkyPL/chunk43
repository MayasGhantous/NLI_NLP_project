  it 's not even nearly as universal and resistant as multilayer composite armor . 
  talk with germans and french . 
  they 're the major two opposing anything else than diplomatic talks . 
  feel free to add it into our [ russian propaganda collection ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zdi0h/pl_foreign_minister_rtoday_setting_new_standards/ ) . 
  i seen your twitter list . 
  excellent work !, 
   here is what euromaidan reported 40 ( !! ), 
  minutes before reuters direct and smaller sources always got an advantage in speed  . 
  glad that large news media pick that up too . 
  the sooner everyone know about it the better . 
   no one have so far been able to confirm with russian military from what i hear . 
  well , so far some of the media i read ca n't agree whatever there really is a russian army or just `` unmarked crimean militia '' . 
  i guess we , the viewers , will see who is right tomorrow . 
  in either case though imho you do n't surround military bases with your own troops unless you want to do something about it . 
  and ultimatum like that perfectly fits current flow of the events . 
   this is really the game changer . 
  steel plated tanks are very vulnerable very very few currently used tanks have pure steel plate armor . 
  even t-72 features reactive armor . 
  most of the modern armors feature various multi-layer ceramic composites ( which is what leopard 2 , challenger 2 , abrams , and few other tanks have ) . 
  o_o lol ... really ? 
  must have different sources of information . 
  the only sources that claim it being `` the best tank in the world '' are those linked to russian military or russian press . 
  [ and that 's quite discouraging if you want to consider their truthfulness ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zdi0h/pl_foreign_minister_rtoday_setting_new_standards/ ) . 
  they already were offered a surrender while their bases were encircled . 
  none of them did . 
  tomorrow on 03:00 gmt we 'll have a full out war . 
  shit got real . 
  so ... after russia conquers crimea we 'll have record-high growth on a markets ? 
  sounds like a guy saved a lots of lives . 
  which is always a great thing to do . 
  but i also ca n't resist my mixed feelings each time i see foreigners involved in protests of a citizens from another country - regardless if they 're from us , ru , israel or anywhere else . 
  the epic event of tank withstanding hits from roughly 70 rpgs is the finest example of how though challenger 2 can be . 
  brits did really great work with armor on that tank . 
  said by gibraltar . 
  priceless  . 
  russia got 743 t90s and roughly 2,255 active t72s ( roughly because it changes daily  ) . 
  far less painful ? 
  for who ? 
  * russians for sure . 
  * crimeans - only if russians would n't rig the elections which is extremely unlikely considering their experience in rigging elections in russia . 
  * ukraine - definitely it will be the most painful thing that could happen , cause crimea is the only reason why they get discounts on gas . 
  no discount = ukrainian economy struggles by far more than it does now . 
  * turkey and other neighbour countries - definitely not as it 'd shake the balance in region as well as show everyone that russia can do whatever it wants and noone will step in to prevent * de facto * annexation ( even if crimea would vote to become independent - it 'd only be a puppet in russian hands , just like south ossetia or abhasia is ) . 
  commissioned in 1985 ( fun fact : build in poland - lol ) is a part of a northern fleet stationed in murmansk . 
  cool , no problem . 
  glad i could help . 
   well , it is after all a democratic way to do things . 
  the democratic way to do things is to go and vote in elections . 
  ukrainian elections will happen sooner rather than later ( i believe date is already set ) . 
   well , why people in crimea do n't want to be part of ukraine then ? 
  plenty of people in poland do n't want to be part of poland either . 
  does n't change the fact that every region in poland remains as it is . 
  you ca n't just have people from upper silesia ( random region with a lot of emigration ) voting a secession to united kingdom or germany ( germany would be their most likely bet after opposition leader accused them of being `` hidden german agenda '' ) . 
   living standards are much higher in russia and majority of the people are ethnic russians . 
  you are confused what `` much higher '' and `` russia '' means . 
  they are much higher in moscow . 
  not russia around ukraine . 
   and they have their own parliament . 
  yep , that 's one of a benefits for being an autonomy . 
  just to remind you - that 's something that ukraine gave to them and they never had in russia before . 
  if they 'll keep it after being annexed is under a huge question mark . 
   this whole shit is a massive fail of ukrainian interior politics . 
  whole shit is a fault of russian bringing unmarked armed forces into crimea . 
  without that situation would n't escalate and crimeans would vote on extending their autonomy - like they were suppose to before putin stepped in . 
  poland got quite a lot of experience in building ifvs ( as well as upgrading older gear to modern standards ) and that 's basically an evolution of ifv . 
  [ kto rosomak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kto_rosomak ) faired exceptionally well in afghanistan . 
  this one is designed with support of bae . 
  here 's [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl-01 ) . 
  but as you mentioned leopard - poles got them and military guys love it . 
  that might be why you see some inspirations  . 
  so now every region in europe gets a right to vote on which country it wants to belong ? 
  i guess quite a few might be interested in secession . 
  and ukraine inherited ukrainian ssr to the full extend . 
  budapest memorandum was just one of few other international deals supporting ukrainian borders . 
  there is no doubt to who legally crimea belongs . 
  noone is going to march against russia . 
  you forgot - troops out there are without any national markings . 
  yea , sure , let 's allow russia to take whatever it wants from countries surrounding it . 
  let 's ignore treaties . 
  let 's ignore global stability . 
  ukrainians gave up one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world of guarantee of their borders . 
  and now you want everyone to forget about it ? 
  peace like that is not a peace - it 's delaying the inevitable . 
   nah , but on south ossetian soil that 's georgia . 
  what you just said is like saying that british forces stepped on walsh soil . 
   there 's some validity to georgia 's claim on south ossetia , not `` some '' . 
  it 's full . 
  there 's quite a few of them , really . 
  [ wikipedia is fine with you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_armed_forces#equipment ) ? 
  hehehe , i would n't mind . 
  [ poland moved tanks to the ukrainian border ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zf7fo/poland_moves_tanks_to_the_ukrainian_border/ ) - which makes it the first military move from any country in eu . 
  other than that we had some strategy meetings going on , but all of them are top-secret , so we do n't know exactly what decisions were made . 
  poland along with turkey and lithuania were nations pushing most for nato reaction on a conflict , however germany and france been blocking efforts opting for purely diplomatic measures . 
  sorry , you 're wrong . 
  poland operates 128 leopard 2 tanks since 2003 , with additional 119 bought last year already in a process of deployment ( ends next year ) . 
  other than that : poland operates in total 991 main battle tanks ( leopard 2a4 , modernized variants of pt-91 , modernized variants of t-72 ) ** having 3rd largest tank army in europe ** . 
  poland also operates over 2000 armored fighting vehicles ( with one of the most up to date line-ups in europe ) , and 1200 various artillery of over 120mm . 
  there 's also quite formidable air force with recently bought f-16s . 
  what 's the weakest link in polish armed forces are helicopters - even though poland got nearly 300 of them - most are post-cold war equipment , and these build in poland are build for support , not front line operations . 
  that 's why poland is currently in a process of negotiating purchase of a modern helicopter fleet .
