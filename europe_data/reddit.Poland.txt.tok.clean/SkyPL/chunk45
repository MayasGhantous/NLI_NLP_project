  poland now deal with that !, 
  poland wins !, 
   these people have practical know-how . 
  they are often retired engineers or specialists who like to transfer their skills . 
  for them it is more a hobby than job . 
  they can not be replaced by generic teachers or younger specialists ( salaries in education are very low ) . 
  i know . 
  in poland we went through a period where all of the teachers went to universities to get a title in pedagogy . 
  it 's perfectly doable , though by far more difficult to older people than younger , inexperienced teachers . 
  it 's certainly a problem - but not a catastrophe . 
   in similar news announced recently schools now have to stop to employ native english speakers to teach the language . 
  a proper stamp is more important than actual ability . 
  oh , now that sux . 
  major problem in polish education system is that we do n't have any native speakers here . 
  so people know english , but are afraid to use it - and even if not - they lack in fluency . 
  that really sux . 
   received a $ 457 usd loan from the imf , mostly to cover debt from last government wow ... now that went easily !, 
  should have asked me - i can easily give $ 457 usd to eliminate national debt . 
  [ aye ] ( http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/joe-biden1-e1344976178397.jpeg ) . 
  yea , very good point  edited to fix it . 
  oversimplification is always bad . 
   some belgians made a clip in syria again , whining about how they are muslims . 
    a bunch of people were arrested because they were drafting kids to go get killed in syria . 
  what 's up with this involvement in syria ? 
  belgium had some history with them ? 
   in 2009 czech republic presided council of the european union . 
  it was taken as a opportunity to spend massive amount of money . 
  from polish presidency we had a ** rainbow ** . 
  it first stood in brussels , then was moved god-knows-where just to end up in warsaw as a symbol of optimism and unity . 
  but guess what ? 
  right-wing nationalists decided that it was a symbol of gays as repetitively burned it during each march . 
  [ here is their joy last time on 11th of november - independence day ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/0/14936/m14936670,klm-9109a.jpg ) . 
  poor flowers . 
   czech technical schooling is in tatters . 
  the ministry fights this decline by requirement that all teachers need to have formal pedagogic education . 
  now about 7 thousand of people - mostly elder technical specialists - are in danger of being forced out of schools . 
  poland implemented the same law few years ago . 
  do n't worry - everything ended up well . 
  few people lost a job ( my uncle included ) but eventually situation settled down . 
  schools handled it just fine .

   fidesz-linked ngo to arrange yet another peace march , as they did regularly in past years with different themes . 
  this time it 's to ** highlight the accomplishment ** of the current government and it 's scheduled to take place a week before the elections o_o seriously ? 
  omg ... reminds me the best days of ussr . 
   the uefa euro 2016 will feature more teams than ever , so everyone is hoping that we can qualify now . 
  good luck with that . 
  poland ended up in a group with gibraltar . 
  we 're fucked . 
  not a chance to advance . 
   this is the first time i 'm doing this because i noticed the lack of coverage for portugal . 
  if so then i must say : excellent work . 
  out of pure curiosity - do all of the news put so much pressure on a news from lisbon ? 
  or is it just your review ? 
  it sounds a bit like a local newspaper - only funnier  . 
  so ... if scotland leaves uk will be `` a country of fewer countries '' , or are they going to rebrand themselves into ununited kingdom ? 
  ( this way shortcut could stay the same - imagine how much money we just saved ! ), 
   why is n't wales a country ? 
  [ * the term `` country '' is used to refer to sovereign states . 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/country ) wales is not a sovereign state . 
  never the less - interesting read . 
  nah , now that spanish government got their e-mails they can mobilize everyone to create `` unmarked-official-but-not-official '' force russia-style . 
   while eastern europe is getting ready for war , what 's going on in this sunny corner of ours ? 
  i love the introduction . 
  ** poland ** -- ukraine - topic of the week * first time ever major opposition party leader ( pis ) and prime minister ( from po ) praise themselves for support to ukraine and speeches done . 
  there 's a huge political mobilization to do everything they can in order to help ukraine , with some voices here and there from various opposition politics that not enough is being done . 
  * tons of news about various ukrainians we 've seen in the news , eg . 
  girl from '' [ i am a ukrainian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvds2aiiwla ) '' video . 
  * various news about `` who-talked-with-who '' about ukraine . 
  * lots of noise from opposition party about polish foreign minister telling ukrainians `` they 'll be all dead '' unless agreement between opposition and ( now former ) government will be signed . 
  general consensus in the end was that this agreement stopped bloodshed , however in euromaydan threw it out of the window for total revolution . 
  -- politics * there 's still no decision about trynkiewicz - a pedophile and murderer who got an amnesty back in 1990 ( after poland got out of eastern block regaining democracy ) and was released last month after sitting 25 years in jail . 
  there was a huge public debate whatever a person like that should be allowed to go free . 
  government passed a law allowing permanent detention in psychiatric clinic for people who might threaten lives of others which not only is very controversial , but many argue it 's both : against constitution and can not be applied to the person that already went free . 
  * [ drunk protasiewicz incident ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1z2ppc/vice_president_of_the_eu_parliament_jacek/ ) . 
  eventually guy stepped down from some of his positions . 
  many wonder if that 's an end of his political career . 
  * some news about opposition party pis leading election polls . 
  poland will have parliament elections in next year , and european elections this year , so it 's a hot topic every week . 
  * mr. macierewicz insists that polish state commission on aircraft accidents investigation should again investigate [ polish president airplane crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) . 
  mr. macierewicz is famous from leading his personal / pis-supported investigations on that airplane accident ( president that died in it was from pis ) often leading to some hilarious suggestions ( let 's see what we had till now ... russian helium bombs , russian micro-explosions on an airplane wings , artificial fog ( created by `` unknown parties '' ( implied : russians ) ) , polish prime minister intentionally leading to death of a president , some simulations that neither he or his team wanted to publish , expertises about airplane wing resistance to the crash with a tree made on a red bull can , and so on and so on ... too many to list , really ) . 
  oh , and btw : he is a vice-chairman of pis which is about to win next elections , as mentioned earlier . 
  * few stories about accidents in hospitals ( newborn deaths , elderly woman having her pancreas removed instead of cancer tumor ) and overall poor state of public health care . 
  * polish ministry of defense signed contract for purchase of training jets and simulators . 
  winning bidder is [ aermacchi m-346 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alenia_aermacchi_m-346_master ) - till 2017 poland will get 8 jets with an option to purchase additional 4 . 
  * this week we also had a national memorial day of a [ cursed soldiers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cursed_soldiers ) - if you got some time i recommend reading through their history , it 's really fascinating . 
  -- sport * lots of praise for our winter olympics - how despite of horrible conditions they managed to achieve more in this year then ever before in a history of winter games . 
  pictures of sportsmen being welcomed by crowd on airports , etc. 
  * updates on how our ski jumping team is doing - ski jumping is a sport of a year ( fun fact : poles randomly change their beloved disciplines each time someone achieves a fancy title ) . 
  robert stoch is still leading world cup . 
  * some more news about polish pathetic football teams & representation ( tm ) . 
  as usually : nothing good happened this week . 
  for euro 2016 poland will play in group d with gibraltar . 
  half of poles joke about them - the other half jokes about polish representation loosing to gibraltar . 
  memes fill the internet . 
  in either case though - there 's not a chance poles will go out of group stage . 
  -- misc : * jokes about tax offices giving awards for filling in tax declarations . 
  in wroc\u0142aw you can win a car . 
  how awesome is that ? 
  * polish network of animal ambulances is growing .
