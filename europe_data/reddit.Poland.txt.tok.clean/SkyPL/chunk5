  see latest hunt for russian submarine and how it failed miserably . 
  it 's not an atlantic ocean either - but we are not buying a nuclear submarines , so no worries there . 
  subs are kept within reasonable size for baltic while still maintaining capabilities that can make a huge difference to the land units . 
  that 's why these subs will have cruise missiles . 
  to support land units by hitting key strategic points such as enemy command centres pretty much everywhere in a proximity of polish borders . 
  it can really make a huge difference in a land war . 
  and subs are also much easier to hide than airplanes or `` land stuff '' so if needed be - we can continue fighting even if whole our land territory would be taken over by the enemy . 
   as long as this allows you to sustain the awesome economic growth seeing how cities taken over by russian terrorists look like - investment in defence is something we really should do , not just for our economy but also for our people . 
   with a 5,900 euros ( $ 8,333 ) price tag . 
  there 's catholic church for you , right there . 
  publishes trial documents closely guarded for 700 years , now available for only 5900 $, 
  oh , i do n't have to believe your word on that - i seen it myself . 
  only it was n't polish , but russian in my case . 
  yep . 
  this comment became a thing now ,

  great ideal , hopefully will happen one day , but sadly currently it 's in retreat with nationalists taking over more and more public space and people do n't view them as a daemons any more . 
  european space programme is strong . 
  it 's third largest and most ambitions space programme in the world . 
  in terms of exploration beyond leo european space agency is second only to nasa .

  that 's better than britain these days :p .

  people complaining . 
  it 's a polish national feature . 
  we complain about pretty much everything , and can always see a bad thing even in most optimistic situation . 
  if talking about weather is a small talk in uk/us - complaining about government/job/life is a small talk in poland . 
  i was n't too bothered about that until i worked abroad for a few years and got some perspective ... 
  polish media in general are very bad when it comes to informing about foreign affairs . 
  probably one of the worst in europe for that matter . 
  we want a beyond horizon capability  . 
  also : differences go beyond qwerty/qwertz/azerty - eg . 
  [ british keyboard ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:kb_united_kingdom.svg ) uses qwerty setup , but there are tons of differences comparing to the [ standard keyboard ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:kb_united_states-noaltgr.svg ) . 
  it 's annoying to the point where i actually take a proper keyboard with myself whenever i work in uk .

   their opponents now whole european parliament is an opponent of a greece ? 
   they do n't understand that not everyone loves army and want to die to defend homeland and your home . 
  they obviously do considering that it 's them who ended conscription in poland . 
  and title of this post is very much misleading . 
  it does n't mean you are going to army for a year or anything like that . 
  it 's an unlikely to happen one-week long military training . 
  you 're not going to be sent on a front lines right away . 
  from what i read it looks more like an early introduction to the guerrilla warfare in case regular army would fail than anything serious . 
  noone is going to send you to the front line after a training like that . 
  cause conscription in it 's existing form was a waste of time and resources . 
  now this money is put into modernisation of army and exercises which are far more useful than conscription . 
  conscription produces nothing more than a pile of incompetent soldiers that - by definition - do n't want to fight , not to mention added issues with corruption , hazing , increasing risk of becoming a criminal and having a negative impact on national economy . 
  current system of professional army with an addition of volunteer training where now anyone can go and get trained for defence of a country is by far better , more efficient and produces more capable defence force than conscription ever did in any country . 
  stopping this nonsense was a very good decision . 
  i doubt ukraine will be able to fulfil the eu requirements in 15 years . 
  it took 14 years for poland and we were both : smaller and less corrupt than ukraine . 
  so `` holding the carrot '' now , after the maidan , is perfectly fair play . 
  now ukrainian government has a goal what certainly helps them with staying in a right path towards * westernization * - having modern democratic government that people desire . 
  and before maidan ... well ... sadly eu outside of poland , sweden and czech , which were pushing eastern partnership , did n't care much about ukrainians . 
   for someone who believes in non-intervention and that eu foreign policy has been overly expansionist this statement presumes that eu dragged ukrainians by their balls with it 's expansionist polices , when in fact ukrainians chose to go on pro-european path themselves . 
  that 's something that russians and mr. farage still refuse to comprehend . 
  that some countries want eu from their own good will . 
  just random people wanting a better life and being part of european community that eu represents . 
  hehehe , i had a 5 days tourist trip to london with my family - have n't seen good half of what i wanted to see . 
  the amount of attractions in bigger eu capitals is just amazing . 
   has its roots in the exclusion of russia from genuine partnerships since the end of the cold war not again this nonsense .

  between 8 % and 45 % + whatever taxation your country puts on it 's officials working for the eu . 
  these days are long gone and never come back . 
  it 's a report from 2012 . 
  before you joined the party , 
   why do n't countries sing in their own languages ? 
  it does n't give you votes . 
  most of the winning songs were english ( even if these were translated from author native language ) . 
  but yea , it 's a shame , i 'd much rather listen to the songs in native languages . 
  i know just how bad translations of polish songs can be , so i imagine it 's equally bad for some/most of the other languages . 
  yea . 
  true . 
  i do n't know what 's up with this voting system . 
  it should be all up to public if they bother with making a vote across three different continents . 
  hehehe , that army polandball .
