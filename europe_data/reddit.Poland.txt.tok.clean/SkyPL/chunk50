  they 're afraid of being called `` indoctrination '' . 
  and besides - we were told europe needs more enrichment , were n't we ? 
  that 's the enrichment . 
  same here . 
  also : slovaks got all the nice caves . 
   when soviets ruled the great beyond not to complain , but they still do . 
  most of the manned space travel is done on a russian vehicles ( the only alternative way for humans into space is by using chinese spacecrafts ) . 
  american english accent and spelling are easier to learn for poles . 
  also most of the mass media use american accent , which is quite important contributing factor in a country that prefers subtitled movies over dubbing , 
   it 's still the only language that i know to have exception to his exception you should be thankful than that you do n't know polish . 
  this shit has more exceptions than rules . 
  and a difficult pronunciation that makes it super-easy to recognize any non-native speakers . 
  i have an utter respect for anyone trying to learn it willingly . 
  i guess [ this flag is out of question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:lentosotakoulu.svg ) ? 
  also worth noting is the fact that this statistic in many cases includes stuff developed by joint european companies , owned by several countries , with components coming from all across the europe and beyond . 
  just for a re-cap , previous winners : * 7th : jpl * 6th : turin polytechnic and `` sapienza '' university of rome * 5th : jpl * 4th : moscow state university * 3rd : cnes * 2nd : turin polytechnic * 1st : jpl jpl = jet propulsion laboratory in this edition , 8th , out of 36 teams taking part in the competition only 17 came back with a solution . 
  here is what nhs has to say on a matter : [ male ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/circumcision/pages/introduction.aspx ) , [ female ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/female-genital-mutilation/pages/introduction.aspx ) . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  the whole `` we do n't want migrants '' trend was originally fuelled by people who lived in germany , france , uk , or other `` multicultural '' countries for years and migrated back to poland . 
  from all the poles i know the most vocal opponents of getting any refugees into poland are these people that lived and worked in one of the big three ( usually uk ) . 
  fyi : that happened because someone tried to force monocultural society from one that was already diverse . 
  not the other way around . 
  it 's a great example of what happens when nationalism gets out of control . 
  so , uk , if that 's illegal - how many people got closed in jails ? 
  so was germany - west half right after ww2 , and east half up till late 90s . 
  hey , baltics , it 's not a topic about you , you 're not a central europe . 
   estonia and latvia got around 15 % of foreign nationals in their population , that 's more than a double of eu average . 
  i would say that you have more than enough experience with diversity . 
  unless suddenly something happened and we start to pick and choose which diversity is diverse enough to qualify as experiencing diversity and which is not . 
   stopping the flow that 's the biggest thing . 
  governments would n't be anywhere near against it as they are now if they 'd know that the numbers they see are final and not just a beginning of seemingly endless wave . 
   but betrayed your v4 !, 
  you never betray the v4 !, 
  get ready for some mafia shit / s i 'd laugh if v4 would actually mean something , but it 's so pathetic `` organisation '' that making fun out of it is n't even amusing any more . 
  i very much agree . 
  average poles are missing the big pictures . 
  they want to have a cake and eat the cake - want to have an influence on what other eu countries do ( especially when it comes to russia and ukraine ) , but not being influenced by them ( especially when it comes to immigration ) . 
   i just hope that after this empty gesture regarding migrant crisis we 'll start talking seriously about long term solution as all that hart warming bollocks about accepting migrants is a big `` welcome to '' message for all illegal migrants , human trafficers and absolutly nothing for those in refuge camps or stability in me region . 
  that 's my hope too . 
  the sooner it begins the better . 
   how about using threats about removing financial aid to deal with dissent ? 
  irrelevant , with no real chances for being implemented . 
  not to mention that the comment / r/europe likes to call so often was actually aimed mostly at an internal german politics in a first place . 
  stupid for you - true for everyone else . 
  you should become a german refugee in germany . 
  best way to go . 
  well , that 's a topic for longer discussion . 
  imho they did ( fear-mongering election campaign was sign clear enough for me ) , though 2007-2011 period was n't that bad , 2011 onwards is when they really started to turn in a bad side instead of just being a * party with problems * like any other . 
  in either case - we 'll agree to disagree , i guess . 
  i 'm quite sure i read it well enough . 
  you just do n't see what my post implies : nowoczesna is n't anything like post-2007 po , and shows no signs of turning in that direction . 
  i do n't watch either . 
  for a matter a fact : do n't even have a tv . 
  in that case - perhaps you watch too much right-wing media ? 
  or like they like calling themselves '' * independent media * '' . 
  ever thought of that ? 
  i have no illusions either - they 'd be far better than any government pis , korwin or kukiz might form . 
  she wo n't be re-elected for dozens of reasons - it was known long before this voting took place , weather she gets re-elected or not got nothing to deal with that vote . 
  and just to be clear : she had every democratic right to make this decision , regardless if majority of people in the polls agree or not . 
  it 's a `` republic of poland '' - our constitution gives her every right to make such decisions . 
  it 's identical in every other country that 's a [ representative democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/representative_democracy ) . 
  that 's why it 's a `` republic of poland '' and not a `` direct democracy of poland '' . 
  these decisions are not be held by an unanimous vote of all poles , not even a majority vote . 
  poles gave up a part of their individual sovereignty to the government long , long ago . 
  voted majority ? 
  sounds perfect . 
  new po that 's not filled with po politicians ? 
  sounds better than any alternative that has a real chances of getting into sejm . 
   and that 's why syria needs these internal camps . 
  yes , of course  also do you honestly think europe will keep all those people ? 
  some of them - yes . 
  not longer than a month ago i still had people trying to convince me here that europe absolutely * needs * these refugees , germany * needs * them , employers * need * them . 
  all of them - probably not . 
  the biggest problem at the moment is not the actual number of refugees now , it 's the fact that it 's a seemingly never-ending wave - not just from syria , but also africa and other middle eastern regions . 
  that 's why this topic turned into a hot potato . 
  solving war in syria will not solve a refugee crisis . 
   still the old uw people at the helm . 
  most of the people at nowoczesna have no political background , including leadership . 
  even if we 'll twist the reality and assume that these are ex-uw people - i do n't have a problem with that . 
  it 's still much better than mentally ill macierewicz , pro-russian korwin , or a singer whose programme is to shout and hate on everything around . 
  but syrians wo n't want to go back , at least not these that migrate into europe ( syrians wanting to go back as soon as possible are in neighbour countries , not in germany ) . 
  not to mention that europe is giving away refugee status to anyone who is even in slightest danger , so people from `` country with a regime that bombed its own people '' will easily qualify for one . 
  reddit keeps on telling me that this is exactly why we * need * migrants . 
  good , nice example of democracy at work . 
  every country representatives voted , now everyone follow the result . 
  is n't that exactly what he is implying ? 
   or create some safe zones inside syria for pre-processing ? 
  why would they ? 
  [ they 've been vetoing that numerous times in the un ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lsml3/blast_from_the_past_2014_russia_opposes_syria_aid/ ) . 
  all russians want is to keep their new pawn - assad - in power . 
  nothing else matters for them, 
   we have common interests like which ?!, 
  after conflict in ukraine it should be more than clear that beyond our own backyard - there 's literally nothing that v4 countries share when it comes to national interests . 
  if president would try to block sejm majority - it 'd end up with another elections . 
  there will be no pis minority government . 
  amusing how people quickly jump on repeating bs from right-wing media without even checking facts . 
  cause that 's what this whole '' * modernpl is just po * '' is - some idiotic right-wing propaganda made to encourage voters into 3 right and far-right parties , with po keeping mouth shut cause they hope it 'll lure few voters from nowoczesna back to them . 
  pis is more of an aws than nowoczesna is po . 
  wow , way to be ignorant , sir .
