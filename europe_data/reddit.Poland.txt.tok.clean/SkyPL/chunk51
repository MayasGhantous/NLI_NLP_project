  i do n't know about eastern europe , perhaps other folks can comment in that , but here in central europe , poland , which is often considered not to be a welfare state , country does offer a free housing , food and financial support for refugees with a granted status , not just these waiting to be processed . 
  hopefully it 'll get more and more difficult . 
  uk did quite nice moves recently to limit the options of an illegal immigrants ( eg . 
  landlords are now obligated to to confirm the immigration status of tenants ) . 
   the only problem i have with this is the lack of representation in these decisions there is no `` lack of representation '' . 
   i 'd rather have a better idea of who my representative is your minister of interior . 
  i guess for you it 'd be socratis hasikos ? 
  i know relatively little about cypriot politics . 
   make the process a bit more formal . 
  it 's already formal . 
  though i find it amusing that people complain so often about eu bureaucracy , and then upvote requests for more bureaucracy . 
   it 's better to get a majority vote , pick a direction and run with it than not make decisions at all and waste time and energy on debates that go nowhere . 
  totally agreed . 
  totally agreed . 
  sadly with the amount of euroscepticism we have , fuelled by lies , turning eu into the federal republic wo n't happen in any foreseeable future . 
   germany did n't need to bully anyone . 
  of course they do n't , but you try to speak reason to people that already have made up their mind on the case : germany is evil bullying entire europe . 
  lol just look at the votes on the posts . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  it 's also a great reminder of what human irresponsibility can lead to . 
  i for one hope that these trips will continue and future generations will keep on being reminded of a chernobyl . 
  the worst thing that could happen is making that place forgotten . 
  so , a middle class guy from the us goes into the chernobyl and is shocked that everyone are not sitting and crying ? 
  also : eating an apple , or `` being there '' will not give you cancer , dude . 
  whoever made this video is ignorant as fuck, 
  always salty . 
  a small bit of sugar for added taste - perhaps . 
  but sweet popcorn ? 
  never even tried that . 
  i for one hope that this result will end the usual `` it 's evil germans that force quotas '' circlejerk we have here on reddit . 
  hopefully that 's the final proof you needed to see that it 's not just germans that support quotas . 
  in fact : it 's most of the eu governments that do . 
  welcome to the parliamentary republic , a form of government that 's not a direct democracy and where you can feel `` betrayed '' as much as you want . 
   the terms council and treaty are not clearly defined . 
  yes , they are , terms like that are always defined , you just need to read more than one article . 
  treaty = [ treaty of lisbon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lisbon ) . 
  council = [ european council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council ), 
  well , from what i recall , last time they said it 's because of security concerns - something that somehow does n't seem to be an issue in the eu or turkey , both of which already fell a victim to numerous terrorist attacks ... 
  hahaha , sorry mate , we 're cool , 
   but its impossible on this scale . 
  thanks for proving my point   stopping the syrian war should be top priority . 
  absolutely !, 
   we can build better camps schools etc. 
  for them . 
  but we ca n't provide them what they want which is a wealthy life with instant cash , this is how they see europe . 
  europe ca n't provide them with wealthy life either . 
  that 's something countries need to work for . 
   you guys should try create jobs in source countries ( considering that a large majority of immigrants are not actually from syria ) that 's very true , that could help to a degree , but it 's nowhere as easy as it might seem - distance , corrupt public services and governments , horrible human rights records , all these factors are hugely limiting for any eu company wanting to invest either in africa or middle east countries in question . 
  they need to do some work too - and in most of african countries this does n't seem to be the case , vast majority of them do n't have the war going like syria does , nor a semi-frozen war like libya does , yet do relatively little to strive for `` western '' standards of life . 
  just look no further than [ the map of countries with death sentence for homosexuality ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:african_homosexuality_laws.svg ) - how do you imagine eu companies sending their employees to the countries where they could be sentenced for death ? 
  it works both ways : over 70 % of the refugees do n't really want anything to do with romania . 
  at all . 
  voivodeship has 2.6 m , so i would say : depends on what they qualify into the metropolitan area . 
  but anyway - that was n't my point . 
  the most obvious contender for the second place is silesian metropolis . 
  even on a most conservative estimations it 's over 2m people . 
  i guess they were counting an entire metropolitan area ? 
  in which case you 'd have to do the same in poland , for a fair comparison , making it much more difficult competition , still not enough to become the second largest . 
   seems legit : ny is the second largest polish city after warsaw . 
  how 213,447 residents make it the second largest one ? 
  your numbers seem to be waaaay off . 
  it would n't even fit into top-10 ( source [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_and_towns_in_poland ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._cities_with_large_polish-american_populations ) ), 
  freedom - the british way . 
   one of the points of whole union was something about equality and shit , then the * eurosceptics * came and started to claim everything is a germany vs * the rest * , even when it could n't be further from truth . 
  soon mass media followed , and we are here , now . 
  [ alde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_group ) has 70 meps out of 751 , and are 4th largest party in the ep . 
  they have no decisive power to enforce their demands . 
  they do know how to lure media attention , though . 
  exactly . 
  germans should be allowed to name all of the armored vehicles in the eu . 
   and yet they are produced . 
  no , they are not . 
  leopards 2 are out of production for over a decade now . 
  germans build enough of them to satisfy demand up till the introduction of leopard 3 . 
  they did fight , and they did have a targets to point that gun at . 
  tanks are used not only in anti-vehicle role , but also an anti-infantry , including coin , duty . 
  [ here you can read a bit about canadian leopards in afghanistan ] ( http://www.army.gov.au/our-future/publications/australian-army-journal/past-editions/~/media/files/our%20future/lwsc%20publications/aaj/2008winter/10-canadianarmourinafghani.pdf ), 
  that 's impressive , i must say . 
   absolutely catelonia , but it 's unwise to oversimplify complex issues like this i think . 
  if they 'd want to they could use everything they can to make it an `` issue '' . 
  your example with fishing industry is a perfect one , imho . 
   what i am arguing is that they would need to apply . 
  they would n't be members automatically . 
  they would . 
  and it 'd take between days and months for them to become an eu members back again . 
  it would n't really be any big problem from a practical point of view . 
  you are right . 
  but still - of all the things that can be an obstacle - spain is near the very top of the list . 
  it 's much the same as in travelling between any other non-schengen zone countries . 
   please note that all nationalities except irish or british require passports . 
  that 's not correct . 
  national id carts are good enough for eu national . 
  eu freedom of movement still applies . 
  ( source : personal experience ), 
  but , but , but ... these are muslims !, 
  tolerance is mandatory , or they 'll radicalise !, 
  * runs away screaming * / s, 
   it 's just an expression . 
  wish it 'd be ... 
   why not do it without the resolution ( like the un matters for anything anymore ) .
