  the lack of any logical arguments on a subject that do n't appeal to emotions is ... disturbing , to say at least . 
   that hungarian fascists , did you see them ? 
  putting refugees in concentration camps , like nazis . 
  that seriously saddens me , because of just how horribly it devalues the actual nazis . 
  these people think that they are fighting some sort of * nazism * with their words , but in fact they are legitimizing an actual radicals . 
  they overuse word * nazi * to things like that and if an actual nazis would come - they would n't have any way to express that . 
  this hugely important and negative connotation is being white-washed by a people like that . 
  i made other post with a few [ propaganda techniques used in that video ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lb43j/the_european_refugee_crisis_and_syria_explained/cv53aho ) , someone reading your comment might find it interesting . 
   it wo n't stop but it would halve and we would have more resources to spend on figuring and carrying out how to stop the migrants from leaving libya . 
  and with that statement we both very much agree on i 'll finish my redditing today , 
   no but , seriously , the articles talks only about germany . 
  well , i thought it 's relevant seeing that germany along with sweden is the final destination for them in europe . 
  but yea , logical fallacy right here , on my side . 
  it 's 38 % according to [ this article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/10/10-truths-about-europes-refugee-crisis ) , slightly older data though . 
  really hard to find anything from last month or two that 's summarizing data for the entire eu . 
   the syrians are the biggest community coming from a single country . 
  true . 
  but even if syrians would suddenly stop coming to europe - crisis would still continue , as most of them are not from syria , and the number of refugees is constantly growing . 
   i do n't think that saving people that are fleeing war needs propaganda unless europeans turn out to be greedy and inhumane people . 
  saving people does n't . 
  but these people were already saved long before reaching , say , hungary . 
  pro-immigrant actions across the different countries do need a propaganda . 
  otherwise how are you 're going to * sell * people a hundreds of thousands of people coming in this year ? 
  calling them * refugees * is a good start . 
   i had a quick look at most of them they seem to be solid . 
  well , i had a quick look too and for me they seemed very manipulative , reminding a days of soviet propaganda more than anything else , what i tried to show in my previous post ( ps . 
  sorry for ninja-edits , but i try to put it in as coherent and precise posts as possible )  mexicans fleeing to the us is an extremely similar situation to maghrebis fleeing to europe . 
  we 'll agree to disagree . 
   well , the syrians are a big chunk of the issue . 
  i agree . 
  it 's approximately 20 % ( [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34270077 ) ) [ ninja edit ] in germany , approx . 
  38 % from [ source ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/10/10-truths-about-europes-refugee-crisis ) , though data is relatively old [ / ninja edit ] . 
  yet they get most of the media attention . 
  it 's a [ card stacking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/card_stacking ) technique of propaganda . 
  even people in the comments here are getting confused by the way how this matter was covered and insist that it 's a video covering only `` syrian refugee crisis '' ( eg . 
  look at the guys in [ this comment tree ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lb43j/the_european_refugee_crisis_and_syria_explained/cv4sp64 ) )  and anyways they do talk about the migrants in the mediterranean never specifying that these are not syrians . 
   also a lot of what they say regards all of the immigrants some is , majority is not . 
  they are either showing data relevant only to syrian refugees or first talk about syrian refugees , then jump on a general topic , and jump back to the syrians , never making any distinction when they are talking about what , easily playing with people watching the video . 
  look : [ fallacy of composition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallacy_of_composition ) and a techniques of propaganda : [ obscurantism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obscurantism ) and [ loosely associated statements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loosely_associated_statements )  i did read them , most of them are ignorant rants based on their racist opinions , while the video did put their sources in the description . 
  here too people do post sources for their opinions contradicting the opinions from the video . 
  the fact that authors of this video posted a list of sources does n't mean that they are all accurate and relevant to the matter . 
  like sources they provided about a crime rates that in fact are showing a crime rates of ** mexican ** immigrants in ** america ** instead of any data relevant to the migrants from middle east or africa . 
  meanwhile here people show how clear link between significant increase of a crime rate and an immigration in europe from these two regions . 
  do n't get me wrong - both sides in this discussion use various techniques of propaganda , but pretending that this video is n't biased could n't be further from truth . 
  when torn apart in more detail than i did it could be used as a great example of pro-immigrant propaganda . 
  for a beginning - the title of this video is '' * the european refugee crisis and syria explained * '' and then they talk only about syria implying that european refugee crisis is all about syrians . 
  other than that - look into some other comments , there are dozens of examples how they either manipulate data or put out plain false statements . 
  the video is about ** european ** refugee crisis . 
  it 's literally in a title . 
  video is very mis-informing in implying that this crisis is all about syrians . 
  only [ 20.1 % ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34270077 ) of * refugees * are syrians - somehow this manipulative video forgets to mention that . 
  syria is not the only source of migrants in a current migrant crisis , though it certainly gets most press of all . 
  afaik not even majority of them are from syria . 
   it takes countries decades to meet the criteria to join and they are required to join the euro now too . 
  scotland would already meet these criteria after completing secession . 
   days ? 
  lol , the eu does n't do anything in a timescale measured in days . 
  it 'd take quite a while after referendum to finalize secession . 
  more than enough time for the eu to prepare everything needed . 
  the only obstacle from that happening in a span of a days would be spain . 
  but how it 'd play out in a real life is a big unknown . 
  how is that a debacle ? 
  care to elaborate ? 
   why does the eu always start with threats on every issue ? 
  why do people interpret every statement from the eu with such a pointless hostility ? 
   even though their original referendum they fought for would have left them outside the eu if they had been successful . 
  that would be only a very temporary state . 
  depending on the eu it could take between days and months for them to jump back into eu . 
  so not really a problem you 're trying to make it . 
   the thing is , to expel catalonia , first the eu ( and spain ) have to recognise it as a state . 
  i think that the logic is a bit different . 
  they would n't be expelled , but rather not-automatically-joining the eu . 
  that said though - i doubt it 'd take much time for them to join into the eu , they would fulfill basic requirements almost from a day one , after that it 's mostly about signing papers for a new country . 
  is that this broken h&k rifle that you guys just found out ca n't aim for shit ? 
  yea ... do n't use that , waste of time . 
  \\ #segwaysforlocals \\ #mercedesformigrant, 
  what the fuck is this shit video ? 
  well , they did * whatever the fuck they wanted * all they way from syria to sweden , so no wonder they 're surprised by a sudden change . 
  knowledge tests are also a pain , in many cases more so than language . 
   no , but poland is undeniably part of a cultural east , does n't matter if you use archaic terms like `` central europe '' . 
  in that case : you have a lot to learn , cause there 's nothing undeniable in your statement nor nothing `` archaic '' in that term just like there 's nothing archaic in term northern or southern europe , in fact that central european term is culturally more distinct than northen european , though grading cultures is a little bit pointless in a first place . 
   sub saharan standards of living for the mases have mostly gone down . 
  [ could have something to deal with that ] ( http://ronunz.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/un_population_projections_steve_sailer_2.png ) . 
  africa is experiencing long , enormously unsustainable population growth . 
  can we stop invoking human rights every time we do n't like something ? 
  that would be much better . 
  the fact that something got nothing to deal with human rights does n't automatically make it good . 
   so we agree then ? 
  the only thing we disagreed about was that you jumped on someone supposedly saying that poland is western european country , what did not happen . 
   not talking about religion , i 'm talking about culture and language . 
  well , you need to remember that in days before world wars religion had an enormous defining impact on a culture in europe . 
  but let 's do a recap : in that case before ww2 poland was pro-western , but in general : central . 
  before that it was split between western and eastern countries , before that it was central . 
  ( these were the days when germany was also central and did n't try to `` upgrade '' themselves to `` western '' , to use your inaccurate analogy ) you behave a little bit like that ignorant stereotype that pretends cold war east-west split is the only reality there ever was or the only one that still exists . 
   sure , poland , estonia , turkey all are countries that are trying to be `` upgraded '' and they get real pissy if you do n't agree . 
  lol, 
   pl is refusing refugees anyway and in fact poland receives more money from the eu as it pays . 
  so i highly doubt that you are forced to pay for anything just a quick side-note : that 's not how eu money works . 
  countries do n't get a pile of random cash that they can allocate at will . 
  all of the eu founds are for a specific objectives .
