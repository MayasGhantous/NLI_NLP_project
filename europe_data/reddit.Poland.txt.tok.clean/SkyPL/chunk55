  an optimist , i see . 
  someone said 1/3 , so it 's not even majority . 
  entire europe should be helping countries on a borders , much more than they do now ( there are additional funds going on to the outer eu countries , but these are like a drop in the ocean during a situation like this one we have now ) . 
  that assumes that none of the migrants got any guns ... 
  hey , people think that closing schengen zone will magically stop them , so i 'm not surprised that you found someone thinking that mountains will . 
   if you want islamic schools gone entirely , you have to be prepared to sacrifice and ban catholic and any other religion-affiliated schools as well , or just ... you know ... control what the fuck they are teaching ? 
  i was shocked by just how little oversight of schools there is in uk comparing to poland . 
  comparing to the uk poland has system where teachers and schools are under regular oversight from superintendents , programme is in depth regulated on a national level , you do n't adhere do the regulations - your school is closed ( not to mention that opening a private school is a difficult endeavour in a first place ) . 
  religious schools in uk got an order of magnitude more freedom in what they are teaching kids than schools in poland do . 
  that enormous freedom in the uk allows indoctrination unseen in here . 
   there was a time when the same thing was said of christianity and judaism . 
  there are always some crazy people believing whatever . 
  bible itself says that it 's not an absolute word of god but rather written by man . 
  [ here is some more elaborate answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l2gtg/its_time_to_confront_islamism_head_onwithout/cv2ygl4 ) . 
  it makes such an important distinction between christianity and islam . 
  migrant crime is already a thing in western , northen and southern europe . 
  not just yet in central , but if you think you 'll be `` escaping to western europe '' you are fooling yourself - cause first of all : there 's nothing to escape from . 
  you 're few dozens ( hundreds ? ), 
  of times more likely to be a victim of a crime from your own countrymen than any migrant in any part of europe , just by a sheer amount of refugees comparing to the native population of any given eu country . 
  almost all of the eu money in netherlands goes into the projects from specific funds - mostly from agriculture , rural development and research areas . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/nl/index_en.cfm ) . 
  these are accounted down to a cent in every eu country . 
  no idea what you mean by `` normal eu money '' , but detailed accounting is quite a standard thing with eu money . 
  funds for projects like an aquapark are not a loan . 
  eu literally ** gives ** them money . 
  if there 's any debt to be created - it could be if said aquapark would n't earn money for itself and his city or a government would have to pay for its maintenance ( which often is n't a case as these things are build in private-public partnership or build by public money and then sold to private operators or public-private companies are created to manage them with shared responsibility for any possible financial failures ) . 
  there is no way of assuming that this would be the case , but since last few years eu does require a buisnessplan documenting that an investment in things like that will return profits . 
  another way of creating debt is if his city goes in debt to cover the remaining 50 % , in which case eu changes relatively little , as these cities would likely go into debt anyway to cover their needs and wants like that - just as they did before the eu , and just like it happens in countries that do not have an eu funds ( eg . 
  some of the cities in us ) - mismanagement is mismanagement with or without the eu , eu only tries to make it less likely to happen than it would if lest to the hands of local governments alone . 
  also note that investments in eu-co-founded aquaparks while being the most common example of supposed wasting of the money , are in fact only a small portion of the investments eu makes . 
  / u/chemicalpleasure - people use aquaparks as an example in poland too , all the time in fact , while in reality the eu money spent on all kinds of sport-recreational objects totalled roughly 500 000 pln ( 120 000 $ ) in years 2007-2013 , which is a silly-small amount of money in a grand scope of things . 
  so if anything - i can encourage / u/scea91 to check how does it look in an absolute terms . 
  every country that 's using eu founds is doing the same , because that 's the eu policy , that 's the condition under which eu countries are getting money from the eu , they need to have everything documented down to a cent , otherwise they wo n't get any money for a project in which documentation does n't add up . 
  there 's nothing unusual in what happens in netherlands to justify you saying that it '' * is one of a few countries that reports * '' . 
  the fact that spending is reported does n't mean that it was a money well spent . 
  fine . 
  then leave the eu , go back to turkey , or wherever they came from , and as soon as situation in syria stabilizes - go back there . 
  sounds like a plan . 
  we 're providing a shelter for refugees , not a holiday resort / integration camp . 
  the other countries meeting the requirement ? 
  usually estonia , sometimes greece , poland , or the czech republic . 
  estonia has a jumpy record , but they do float around 2 % . 
  poland will start meeting 2 % next year ( though technically we did it since last year , if you include payments for f-16s which go through the ministry of state treasury , if not - we 've always floated right below the 2 % goal ) , czech republic in 2014 was at 1 % , greece pretty much always kept it 's budget above 2 % goal . 
  to give you a perspective , in 2014 only us , uk and estonia met 2 % goal , and only france , poland and turkey spent over 1.5 % . 
  other major eu countries spent 1.2 % or less . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.sipri.org/media/website-photos/milex-media-backgrounder-2015 ) saying that czech republic is sometimes meeting the requirements is a bit generous to what they 're actually doing  last time they met 2 % was in 2005 , they 've been on a quick decline ever since , though afaik 2016 budget will be higher than this year and they plan to keep the increasing trend until 2018/2020 ( depends on a source , i do n't know what 's the goal currently , perhaps someone from czech republic could clarify it , but in the may 2015 it was to increase mod budget up to 1.4 % gdp by 2020 ), 
  you 're not the only one ... sometimes i have an impression that a good 90 % of poles dislike warsawians , even though i know it 's not true . 
  i could n't understand a thing ... for a moment thought that english part is in swedish too :(, 
  [ ] yes , get annexed by ulm, 
  yep . 
  let me put more pressure on a `` baltic sea '' part . 
  in case of ... for example an invasion on any of the three baltic states - swedish membership in nato could be invaluable . 
  that one might happen regardless of sweden/finland ... 
   which begs the question of why the hell we 'd want them in nato in the first place , bases . 
  sweden has a strategic location for the military reasons . 
  baltic sea and finland make any invasion very easy to repel , while it 's a perfect place to perform air strikes and/or ensure supremacy over a baltic sea . 
  much like norway - it 's important for where it is , not what military it has . 
  but even in a topic of military sweden is n't some backwater nation - they got very well developed aerospace and shipbuilding industries , which might be important for strategic reasons . 
   agreed and that 's why nato needs to be left to the history books with the cold war . 
  nato was about to do that , but then georgia happened . 
  and when politicians started to think again about dismantling nato - ukraine happened . 
  putin - doing a better pr work for nato than nato ever did for itself . 
  what makes no difference what so ever - before that they used war in libya as an excuse , or whatever other war was happening in any nearby african country to the one they were from . 
  or actually - it actually does n't have to be a war in a first place - eritreans used a human rights situation in their country as a reason for getting asylum in europe . 
   well , to be fair , the us does tend to establish self-governing democracies . 
  cause we all know how well it works ... * cough * iraq * cough * afghanistan * cough * libya * cough * somalia * cough * lebanon * cough * vietnam * cough * * cough * * cough *, 
  you still refuse to comprehend what i 'm saying . 
  maybe this will help , to use your example : no war = no claim to refugee status = migrant crisis ** still underway ** because migrant crisis is much more than a syrian war refugees . 
  migrant crisis \u2260 syrian refugees . 
  read my post again . 
  we do n't disagree on a subject of syrian refugees . 
  but migrant crisis \u2260 syrian refugees . 
  sad but true . 
  even if , someone would manage to stop fighting in syria - none of the sides in this conflict has enough power to maintain control over the country , and the only somewhat-democratic groups in syria are currently the weakest and most fragile of all . 
  establishing intermediate colony for a transition period between chaos and democracy , with a task of educating society about the democracy , maintaining peace , establishing working health , police , border control services , etc. 
  - it might be not as bad as it looks on a first glance . 
  not to mention that it 'd give a chance for splitting the country in two or three parts - what would most likely be necessary given the vast ethnic and cultural differences between different parts of it . 
  but there 's a lot of problems with that , especially in a fact that it 'd ruin the global opinion of europe - it 'd be almost like giving a sword to russia , asking them to cut out more slices from countries they ... * like too much * . 
  he says that ending war in syria will end * migrant * crisis , while in fact all it will end are * war refugees coming from syria * . 
  everyone else will keep on trying to get into the eu . 
  [ migrant crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis#migration ) is much bigger than just syria . 
  syria is just a headline for last months , but crisis itself will persist even after war is resolved and even if all syrians would go back to their country . 
   maybe it 's time to establish europe in the middle east ? 
  talk with brits , they got [ some experience with that ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:british_empire_1921.png ) , 
  this war does n't have two sides ... 
  depending how you do the maths , it 's 3 , 5 , or more . 
  schengen zone as such is not suspended . 
  only germany re-instated controls on a border with austria . 
  schengen is functioning as previously pretty much everywhere else . 
   was there any indication that that was going to happen ? 
  yes , of course . 
  [ isis saying that it 'll flood europe with migrants ] ( http://www.jihadwatch.org/2015/09/flashback-to-february-2015-islamic-state-threatens-to-flood-europe-with-refugees ) , [ isis fighters posing as refugees to get into europe ] ( http://www.jpost.com/international/us-intelligence-islamic-state-fighters-pose-as-syrian-refugees-to-enter-europe-378084 ) , etc. 
  smuggling weapons by posing as one of the of hundreds of thousands migrants getting into germany is an obvious thing to do for every terrorist in a middle east wanting to make an attack in europe . 
  not to mention that some of these people might own weapons for their own personal defense . 
  they do n't have any right to own it in germany , but it 'd be perfectly understandable while being smuggled by some shady individuals on a boat through aegean sea . 
  i see no reason why germany should wait for bombs to explode or gunman starting to kill german citizens in order to check immigrants for any illegal possessions . 
   why are you quoting some syrian refugee kid as a source for your bullshit `` invitation '' myth myth or not - that 's what syrians believe in . 
  and that 's only thing that matters right now . 
   we wo n't send the syrian refugees in germany back which is more than obvious to be interpreted as a * de facto * invitation .
