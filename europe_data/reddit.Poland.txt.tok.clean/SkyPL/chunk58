  it makes transition to the post-war reality much easier . 
   because they 're the only one in eu saying everyone is welcomed . 
  [ this comment sums it up pretty nicely ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jh20s/hungarian_pm_migrant_crisis_is_a_german_problem/cup6qo0 ) . 
  no matter how many times germans will deny it - merkel created a general perception among migrants and refugees that they should head in that direction . 
  that was one of the biggest mistakes in this whole crisis brining a whole new burden on most of the southern and south-eastern european nations . 
  there is no * or * . 
  otherwise something concrete would be done already instead of this whole circus with individual prime ministers arguing over getting a few hundred migrants more or less . 
  agreed with everything you said !, 
  it 's the same in almost every country ( germany being one of obvious exceptions ) . 
  guys in the eu are almost in a puzzle with no easy solution - noone wants to cooperate , and everyone expect them to solve all the problems . 
   they are concentrated in one area and the impact on turkey is high . 
  the actual impact and expenses associated are actually lower if you concentrate people than if you spread them around . 
  yes , in that very point an impact is huge , but on a wide scale - it 's far , far lower than it 'd be if every person would be taken care of separately . 
  someone mentioned that in netherlands it 's an average of around 30000 euro per year/person ( $ 2500/month ) , which is an enormous amount of money comparing to the costs that can be achieved in coordinated refugee camp in turkey ( where you [ pay 50 $ per month/person ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/magazine/how-to-build-a-perfect-refugee-camp.html?_r=0 ) for food & additional expenses , excluding housing and water/electricity ), 
  it does exist . 
  read about 1951 refugee convention . 
  it basically means that we have an open borders for the refugees ( and , according to media , these were a refugees , or at a very least - hoped to be accepted as such ), 
   so where is the us in all of this ? 
  pretending they did no wrong and have no obligation in helping to deal with the crisis . 
  you 're really good in going back in time . 
   if you 're in schengen , you 've got open borders and it becomes your problem . 
  brits are not in schengen and it 's still their problem too . 
  migrants do n't care about schengen . 
  they crossed the sea , and several countries between greece and schengen zone . 
  border control is not an obstacle to any of them . 
  thinking that closing schengen zone would affect anything is just a naivety . 
   what about countries like germany who 's population is becoming older at a faster rate than new people are being born ? 
  wait until their economy collapses under it ? 
  actively encourage people to have children . 
  do your best to ensure germans get everything they need , that having family is trendy , that people do n't feel like it 's either career or children , change the way of thinking about family and children , etc. 
  it 's not easy , but it 's the only way to ensure that there are germans there to worry about that economic collapse in a first place . 
  immigrants can be considered a solution only if you want to turn germany into middle-eastern country in a middle of europe . 
   because then it would be essentially little syria seriously ? 
  you 're comparing war-torn syria where people die every day with a safe and democratic country which just happens to have a lot of migrants from syria ? 
  and how `` little syria '' in turkey is not ok , while `` little syria '' in germany is suddenly welcome ? 
  i ca n't express just how ridiculously stupid your post is . 
   but her suggestion was more humane and more likely to work than most people 's suggestions of ` do nothing ' or ` accept all the migrants ' sad , but true . 
   there is a third option : intervene in syria and give the refugees a safe place to return to . 
  and what , create a colony or permanently occupied zone ? 
  be serious . 
  an intervention involving any troops should only happen with a permission and a request of the syrian government . 
  we should not repeat the same mistakes us did - an invasion with a blind hope that a proper , stable and functional western-style democratic government will create itself . 
  there is no way to force a creation of a stable , democratic country . 
  people from us , of all the countries , should understand it by now . 
  at the moment europe is the one flooded with migrants , so waiting for whoever is responsible and pointing fingers is not a solution to anything . 
  and yet when eu tries to establish a policy - individual countries agree only for some laughably small numbers . 
  at least he is actually providing some reliable source to back up his claims , regardless if it 's from yesterday or january this year , which is more than i see other people doing here . 
   onet.pl , wykop.pl , holy fuck , you choice of the websites to read is really ... * unwise * . 
  these are the places where normal people do n't go , or at a very least - do n't ready any comments , yet alone : post there . 
   `` independent media '' websites whatever that means -- i see now why you have such an impressions . 
  believe it or not - real life outside of these ( and few other ) shit holes is much better ... and brighter . 
  seeing what you read - you might just as well complain about racism on a 4chan . 
  lol, 
  brits like to be ... `` original '' , 
  at least he thinks so . 
  no idea what he reads , but i very rarely see a comments like these in `` polish internet '' . 
  you really need to change people you 're seeing / reading if you think it 's a `` majority '' . 
  teenagers on steroids . 
  the worst kind . 
  we 're smart , that 's all . 
  polish . 
  as usual . 
  well if these are the ` historical events which your country does talk a lot about ' then i 'm impressed . 
  what did i just read ? 
  better , 
  and i thought that 1410 is already going too far back . 
  wow , you really dig in a history . 
   eu tried to push far far larger quotas then we agreed on final agreement . 
  of course they did . 
  what national politicians agreed for was like a drop in an ocean . 
  they seem to be completely detached from the sheer amount of people eu as a whole is dealing with . 
   essentially they tried to make eastern europe the dumping ground for all there migrants how did you come up with that ? 
  nothing like that happened . 
  there 's nothing in any of these propositions that would be aimed specifically at the eastern europe . 
  it 's suppose to help everyone . 
   that 's a textbook example of stick & carrot . 
  more like an example of actually trying to do something , as opposite to pretending that the problem does n't exist or at a very least got nothing to deal with them , which is what plenty of eastern europeans choose to do . 
  both might be true , but do n't really matter in a context of this proposition . 
  it 's not suppose to be a way for you to earn money on a migrants , it 's suppose to help countries handle a financial side of the issue . 
  thanks for specifically pointing us towards the work below your minimal wage . 
   this would work if they are indeed asylum seekers . 
  said proposition covers only asylum seekers . 
  noone else .

  i studied photonics , yes , but not in joensuu , 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's due to to the fact that [ light can be polarized by reflection ] ( http://www.photonics.com/article.aspx?aid=35808 ) . 
  an angle between sun , water , and you was a [ brewster 's angle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brewster's_angle ) . 
  it was quite a lucky coincidence ( right position of all the elements + you having the pl glasses to see it * ) , but not unusual nor related to the windows in any way . 
  * ok , you did n't actually had to have a polarization glasses to know that something is going on - [ humans can perceive a polarization of light ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haidinger's_brush ) but you need to know what to look for . 
  and you still needed pl glasses to make these nice photographs , 
  polarization can be really amazing at a times . 
  [ here are some simple plastic items ] ( http://alphacorner.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/polaryzacja.jpg ) lit by a polarized light ( every lcd emits highly polarized light , so that 's easy to get , eg . 
  use an ipad displaying a white page ) and viewed through a polarization filter 90 degrees away from the polarization of the light source ( just rotate your filter ( or glasses ) until items turn into rainbows  ) you can use that to determine stress distribution in transparent items - this technique is called [ photoelasticity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/photoelasticity ) . 
  it 's one of the simplest yet less known scientific experiments you can do at home . 
   around 30.000 euro per year , per asylumseeker in the netherlands .
