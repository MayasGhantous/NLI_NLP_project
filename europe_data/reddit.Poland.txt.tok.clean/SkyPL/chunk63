  i 'm quite sure he was just making a joke ... though you are certainly right about that and i really hope that nuclear war will never happen . 
   oh , i forgot about the special russian perk , my bad . 
  this just begs to be implemented in next europa universalis patch . 
  they are both . 
  conventional and nuclear . 
  depends on a warhead used in a specific unit . 
  this variety allows russians to put more pressure without actually fielding nukes themselves ( opponent has no way of telling if particular launcher is nuclear or conventional ) . 
  so with a single order you can execute coordinated nuclear strike . 
  it does n't matter all that much ( reprogramming ) , considering that if anyone is going to nuke poland - it 's russia , so they 'll have as much time to assign targets as they 'd wish , but it works well for pr reasons ( both : internal and putting pressure on nato countries along with proxies ) . 
  the new polish shield will ( to be operational in 2022 ) . 
  islanders are one of the main targets for its outer layer . 
   in 2018 russia will have iskanders in kaliningrad aimed to our territory . 
  you are not reading the news carefully . 
  russia always has iskanders in kaliningrad aimed at poland . 
  always . 
  that 's united states of america you are talking about . 
  it 'd turn us into another ukraine . 
  the only worse thing than that would be straight on russian invasion . 
   because people of europe do n't actually get to vote on european policy nor they vote on national polices ( exceptions apply )  because eu-president is n't actually voted in nor they vote on national prime minister ( exceptions apply )  after this point , elected officials only get to vote , yes or no votes on the actual policy that 's false . 
  though process is more obscure than on national level . 
   future more , when people are voting for people who will end up in european council they are voting on national matters , not european matters . 
  that ... depends . 
  i would say : majority does , but there 's always a portion of people that understand how this thing works . 
  it 's somewhat similar to national elections where votes or majority are more related to emotions than an actual , objective judgement of all the accomplishments during the cadence . 
  that 's how democracy works - people have a right to make a vote based on whatever they feel is right . 
   this is even more clear when you look at how european commission actually does it law making , they just keep on pushing laws through until parliament votes yes on them that 's false . 
   good example of this is eu-constitution which was later renamed lisbon treaty to avoid national elections . 
  enormous oversimplification , not to call it bluntly : twisting facts . 
  mississippi flag - still living in a past , missing good old days of slavery . 
  [ from here  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_the_confederate_states_of_america )  george william bagby praised the flag , referring to the saltire in the flag 's canton as the `` southern cross '' , as did others at the time , and stating that it embodied `` the destiny of the southern master and his african slave '' , pointing them southward to `` the banks of the amazon '' , expressing the desire many confederates held of expanding slavery southward into latin america . 
  lack of political will . 
  or as someone else put it : making blowjobs to the us . 
  meanwhile snowden still can not get into eu without fearing for his life . 
  if ~ ~ eu council ~ ~ council of europe wants to do something for snowden - they should first ensure that the eu countries grant him asylum . 
  he is wrong in that [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3atelg/nato_members_defense_spending_in_two_charts/csft6ol ) above . 
  mod budget is 1.95 % , this 2.2 % includes payment for f-16 . 
  no payments for `` choppers '' are being made yet , while `` rockets and navy '' are paid by mod . 
   article 8  each party declares that none of the international engagements now in force between it and any other of the parties or any third state is in conflict with the provisions of this treaty , and undertakes not to enter into any international engagement in conflict with this treaty . 
  that 's as far as you 'll get when it comes to the treaty mentioning anything related to the internal conflict between nato member states . 
  for those interested : ananas comes from tup\u00ed ( indigenous brazilian people ) word * nanas * , meaning `` excellent fruit '' . 
  ( til , source : uncle google ), 
  wow , you really created some long philosophy to that whole thing . 
  including confusion of various terms ( obvious example : `` slavic '' is not a synonym of `` eastern european '' even though you use it as a synonyms leading to some silly conclusions ) also this :  trying to indiscriminately mimic our friends in the west . 
  makes me laugh . 
  sounds like you 're one of these silly self-imposed pseudo-nationalists that blindly hate everything vaguely described as * west * . 
   proper nomenclature as in ? 
  central europe ? 
  of course . 
  historically poland was a central european country , even as recently as during the interwar period . 
  making poland eastern europan is something created by the cold war reality . 
  funnily enough - before that period a split between eastern and western europe was made along the lines of eastern ( orthodox ) and western christianity . 
  poland is and always was between western culture and eastern orthodox culture . 
  hence : we 're central europeans . 
  there is no reason to think of it as something bad and that we must inherently belong either to the * west * or * east * . 
  you missed the first paragraph : '' * a new pay threshold for migrants means * *** non - **** european workers will have to leave the uk after six years if they are not earning at least # 35,000 * '' . 
  eu freedom of movement does n't have anything to deal with that law . 
  [ edit ] thanks for downvotes reddit , love you too , and i know it 's not hematophagian . 
  most people ca n't even tell the difference between slovenia and slovakia , so i say : for the sake of simplicity - make it central . 
  interesting , cause i see quite the opposite - back in '80s it was all about cold-war split and eastern europe , it slowly faded in '90s and early ' 00s , but now seems like people finally got off chains of eastern bloc mentality and use proper nomenclature . 
  if people identify themselves as `` eastern europeans '' they 're either talking in a historical context of cold war or are one of these guys that think everything was better before 1989 . 
  we should use ananas till english-speaking countries give up and adopt it . 
  uk at it 's finest . 
  complaining when immigrants are taking jobs , complaining when immigrants are n't taking jobs . 
  also some of the sounds that do n't really exist in polish tend to be very problematic . 
  \u00e6 is either pronounced as a clear a or e , never correctly . 
  same with th sounds - / \u03b8 / or / t\u03b8 / - usually get cut to simple / t / . 
  http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense-news/bizwatch/2015/01/23/spacex-satellites-new-constellation/22159241/ - they 're talking about altitudes of ~ 1,100 km , but it 's still undecided - it 's not one of the most congregated altitudes , but just above them , meaning that post-lifetime degradation of the orbit will be very dangerous . 
  funny enough - musk seemed quite surprised when he first heard concerns about debris , but said that they 'll look into that problem , though knowing that to date they did n't announce anything at all in that topic , and seeing that their aim is to develop it for as low costs as possible - proper deorbiting is unlikely to happen . 
  so while esa is running clean space programme to make sure that there 's less and less pollution in low earth orbit - spacex is doing the exact opposite in a completely irresponsible way . 
  as said - depends on a details of implementation , but it usually means that signal goes up to the satellite , then gets passed through multiple sats to reach to ground station , there it 's being passed to the fiber and goes all the way to the server in a similar way it 'd go from your home . 
  then it comes back to the ground station , is sent back to the nearest satellite , gets passed through multiple sats to reach one close to you , and you get the data back . 
  for a distant servers that are far from you , but close to the ground station - it will be quicker than fiber - but for stations that are in your area ( country ) when ground station is n't - it 's going to be notably longer . 
  as you said : it 's physics . 
  in soviet russia , moscow grant thefts your auto !, 
  wow ... french actually bulldozed these * settlements * ? 
  surprisingly bold move after all this time . 
  changes in germany seem to be most interesting . 
  meps from polish kongres nowej prawicy did n't join the party ? 
  nah ... they 're missing out in that ... * fun * club !, 
   will orbit low enough for the ping to be better or equal to ground fiber sorry , but at a best case it 's going to be comparable to fiber , in everyday use - it 's going to be notably higher . 
  details obviously depend on a specific implementation , but i would be careful with consuming spacex marketing in large doses . 
   their own fleet of 4000 satellites . 
  which will be an important problem in terms debris threat , significantly increasing a risk of kessler effect on leo . 
  to make things worse spacex does n't have any debris migration plan , despite of being held on an orbits higher than iss . 
  just to put it in a perspective : currently on leo there 's 8 500 objects larger than 10 cm , including 669 operational satellites . 
  adding 4000 spacex cubes will make a substantial difference , especially considering that orbital decay will cause them to pass through all of the orbits with highest densities of derbies without having any control over a path of decaying satellite . 
  a difference we people should remember about considering that this is the range of orbits where humans live in space . 
  spacex does n't manufacture satellites . 
  there 's no competition between these two . 
  at least : not yet . 
  i understand people try to push spacex everywhere , but ... it really needs to cool down . 
  there might be a competition between oneweb and new spacex offspring if it will be created and if it will launch it 's satellites , but that 's about it . 
  it was a model . 
  real satellites are going to weight ~ 150kg . 
  it 's in the article . 
  next esa astronaut is [ andreas mogensen ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/human_spaceflight/astronauts/andreas_mogensen ) . 
  he will fly in [ soyuz tma-18m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soyuz_tma-18m ) flight , currently planned for september . 
  perfectly executed landing , and very good behavior with the ejection system ( you can see he did n't panic and stayed in cockpit until plane started to slip out of control ) . 
  highly professional handling of the situation , well done . 
  she is the astronaut known from [ the record for longest single space flight by a woman ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3906q8/esas_sam_cristoforetti_now_holds_the_record_for/ ) and longest single flight by any esa astronaut ever .
