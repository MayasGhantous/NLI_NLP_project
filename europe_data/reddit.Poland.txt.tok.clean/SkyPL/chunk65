  ok , there 's one exception - tape with minister nowak , but in that case prosecutors did react and guy is permanently gone from politics . 
  to give you some examples of most famous parts from these tapes ( my own translations of the conversations , non-italic parts are my own addendum ) * sikorski ( minister of foreign affairs ) said that '' * polish-american alliance is not worth a dime . 
  it 's actually harmful , because it gives poland a false sense of security * '' - '' * why ? 
  * '' - `` it 's an * utter bullshit . 
  we 'll conflict ourselves with germans and russia , * and * we 'll think that everything is superb , because we did a blowjob to the us . * '' . 
  * another quote from sikorski conversation that became a classic : '' * problem in poland is that we have a very low pride and self-esteem * '' - '' * sort of sentimentalism * '' - '' * sort of * '' ... now a very difficult to word translate : '' * murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 * '' - being-like-a-black-guy ? 
  * sienkiewicz ( minister of interior ) said that : '' * polish state exists only in theory , not in practice , because it works only with it 's individual parts , without understanding that a state is one entity * '' ( the first part of this quote is very often taken out of context and used as a * proof * of how bad government poland has ) . 
  * belka ( head of the national bank ) and sienkiewicz : '' * or they are able to buy these bonds at some exceptionally attractive prices , so highly profitable . 
  then -- and here is the point in having your own currency , not euro -- then national bank can say this : < < well , i could buy some of these bonds , maybe not directly on an auction in the ministry of finance , but for example in bgk or pko bp   * '' these two are a names the banks '' * , so doing something that 's formally impossible * '' - '' * there 's something in that ... * '' - '' * of course , there is * '' - '' * ok * '' - '' * so i could buy these bonds . 
  but it 'd have to be under some conditions , or something like that * '' ( legally in poland an independent national bank is not allowed to finance national debt , they were discussing possible scenarios of bypassing this law by financing banks that would finance the debt ) that said though - ask anyone from a ( far ) right side of the political spectrum and they 'll say that discussions recorded were a * treason * and will down-vote me to hell ( some of them actually consider it a '' [ jewish coup d'\u00e9tat ] ( http://niepoprawni.pl/blog/6496/tasmy-wprost-zydowski-zamach-stanu ) '' ) '' [ part 3 about nowak ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39bo14/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_in_poland_with/cs2124w ), 
  some ministers were spied upon in a restaurant , tapes were published by one journal shouting about `` treason '' and `` coup d'\u00e9tat '' because they did n't liked what they heard . 
  obviously there was no treason , but none the less - government promised to investigate the case and punish these guilty of spying on the ministers . 
  prosecutors came out to be a complete garbage , being unable to come up with anything in any reasonable amount of time . 
  eventually tapes leaked out to controversial businessmen with some shady ties ( arrests on account , etc. ), 
  and he published all of it on facebook as he got it . 
  result of it is basically a total discrediting of state - it was unable to prevent ministers from being spied , ministers obviously said a lot things during these conversations that should n't be leaked to public , prosecutors were unable to finish the case , police was unable to take the guy into custody even though he did broke the law , prosecutors again failed to react on another leak ... overall rather miserable situation . 
  as a results ministers from the tapes decided to `` sacrifice '' themselves to avoid a collapse of an entire government . 
  i see some people think i 'm being very forgiving , well , unlike most : i actually listened to all of the leaked tapes before making my judgement on the case . 
  '' [ part 2 with some quotes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39bo14/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_in_poland_with/cs2124w ) , [ part 3 about nowak ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39bo14/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_in_poland_with/cs2124w ), 
  seriously though : this is some amazing science , well done !, 
  it seems to be more fundamental problem related to maintenance in your air forces than anything gripen-specific . 
  though only a results of full investigation will tell what 's the cause for sure . 
  quite amusing considering that in most of european countries , including hungary ( op 's own country ) it 's the opposite of what op said . 
  us is the one that got a lower age at first marriage . 
   your governments are going too slowly . 
  amusing reading that from the `` what we will opt-out from today '' country . 
  no wonder , really . 
  there 's no good reason not to have a referendum . 
  does n't mean they are automatically worse . 
  it 's impossible to make any assumptions about hit ratios in order to make a comparison . 
  even more so if you 'll take into account that systems bought by poland will be a new generation - with new software and a large portion of a new hardware , so previous experiences do n't provide nearly as much advantage as it might seem at the first glance . 
  systems that were battle tested got very , very little to deal with systems that will be purchased . 
  as a result of all these unknowns in terms of possible hit ratios other factors come into play . 
  and that 's where patriot is loosing . 
  that said though it does have few obvious advantages : the fact that us can quickly provide multiple launchers for protection and development of a next generation has a lower degree of uncertainty ( not in a terms of `` if '' it will be build , cause it 's going to be build for all competitors , but when and how much it 's going to cost ) . 
  someone should compile these into one huge pan-european map . 
  [ you can try with that article for the beginning ] ( http://www.defence24.com/analysis_the-tender-of-the-century-a-choice-by-politicians-or-the-military ) - it 's written from a perspective of polish tender , however it also lists numerous drawbacks of patriot system comparing to other competitors , a drawbacks that go beyond issues discovered during desert storm . 
  meads was offered to poland with an exceptionally good contract ( we 'd become an equal partners in development instead of just a paying customers ) , however mod opted for still to be developed variant of a patriot . 
  after that decision there was some worry if meads would have enough funding for future development - i 'm most glad that germany is committed to the project as , unlike patriots , it 's really future-proof system . 
  you 'd want us to talk about german coal in polish ? 
  random interesting fact : new esa general director , johann-dietrich woerner ( starts his cadence on 1 july 2015 ) , is an advocate of the moon base project . 
  this should make it more likely to be build than ever before , though i would n't get my hopes too high , as this concept still has very little financial support outside of very preliminary studies . 
  also [ here is an article on esa website ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/space_engineering_technology/building_a_lunar_base_with_3d_printing ) . 
  ( yes , it 's from january . 
  that 's daily mail for you there - recycling old topics ), 
   no , it 's not forbidden , the law was deemed by constitutional tribunal unconstitutional oh , did they ? 
  that 's a news to me . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  both are right . 
  cities are polluted , but overall picture is n't nearly as bad as it might look from this slice of data . 
  poland really invested a lot in minimizing emission from coal powerplants - effects are clearly visible . 
  burning coal at homes is n't the major factor either . 
  since 2013 it 's forbidden to burn coal in homes in the city of krak\u00f3w . 
  and yet it 's the polish city with largest smog problem of all . 
  topography , meteorological factors , car emission , industry , construction works , or even things like not cleaning streets often enough , all contribute to the amount of fine particles and other pollutants in the air . 
  interestingly enough , poland also got lower emission per capita than many other european countries , for example germany ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capita ) ) . 
  also : [ poland is screwed with renewables ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36hcyd/availability_of_wind_power_in_the_european_union/cre2cxq ), 
  suckers !, 
  * m\u00ff\u00e4\u1e27\u00e4\u1e27\u00e4\u1e27\u00e4\u00e4\u1e27\u00e4\u1e27 * \u1e0a\u00f6 \u00cf \u1e0b\u00f6 \u00ef\u1e97 \u1e59\u00ef\u0121\u1e27\u1e97 ? 
  it certainly would be great as wikipedia is in a huge need of improving and adding content related to european ( and other non-us ) space activities ( french-speaking editors would be especially appreciated as a lot of information is not available in english but is in french , and french magazines , such as le figaro , do better job in covering european space programme than any other . 
  though specifics are a topic for a separate discussion ) . 
  i 'm sorry , that 's really not what i meant . 
  i was looking at it from purely positive point of view - gerst was really a great guy , knowing him from this little free time he had and decided to share his space adventure with people on twitter and through other media . 
   it strikes me how little there is on the wikipedia pages of some . 
  most of wikipedia editors that write any content related to space are either spacex fanboys or editors from us having a long standing love for nasa . 
  you wo n't find any good content about non-us space programmes on english wikipedia . 
  and even if there is some content - it tends to be filled with links to every article in the internet sharing their point of view on how everything europeans make is an inferior version of glorious us space exploration programmes and rockets . 
  if someone is interested in a topic then instead of reading a text from the editor of christian science monitor i can highly recommend listening to one of the lectures of timothy snyder - he is an american historian specialized in a history of central and eastern europe . 
  [ for example this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bey-edbm0k ) , on a subject of war in ukraine and reaction of the eu . 
   the british will not leave the uk i laughed out loud , 
  it 's also the [ longest single space flight for esa astronaut ] ( http://outpost42.esa.int/blog/samantha-beats-esa-astronaut-single-duration-record/ ) . 
  great achievements !, 
  that said though - on purely personal level i found it more fun and enjoyable to track previous esa astronaut , alexander gerst . 
  he was more charismatic and spontaneous guy , even if his mission was n't nearly as unique as sam 's mission is . 
  their list of meps needs an update . 
  andrzej duda is not a mep since 25.05.2015 . 
  i would n't mind to have it cleaner though . 
  posts on white background instead of these gray boxes , links on a right in light blue instead of being huge and dark , also use smaller , non-bold font for the buttons . 
  and the content of right-hand menu should imho stay as it is - it 's quite helpful to have these features there , somehow on a proposed layout some of them are missing . 
  well , [ they could build two ] ( http://www.highreshdwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/the-two-towers.jpg ) , 
  it has multiple underground levels . 
  you do n't run around ... 
  * and * germany, 
  `` northern '', 
  i 'm quite sure we already had some discussions about these maps . 
  they are quite inaccurate . 
  i 'm yet to see qwertz keyboard in poland , while [ uk has it 's own keyboard layout ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:kb_united_kingdom.svg ) , even though it 's qwerty . 
  you imply i 'm one of the very few people around here that actually read the articles instead of just skimming through the title and going right down to comment ? 
  well then ... good guess . 
   on the other hand , in a russia-finland conflict , obviously the west would strongly favor finland ; it 'd be painful to watch another winter war without being able to do anything . 
  i doubt it 'd only `` favor '' them - it 'd end with a military intervention . 
  xixth century , here we come !, 
   or remove them altogether . 
  this . 
  i have n't seen a subreddit where they 'd actually be beneficial . 
  i use my sorcery skills . 
  that 's an nsdap victory , parties were on a ballot , not hitler . 
  quite impressive considering a population of 500 000 , 
   people will stop being pissed at their governments and their frustrations will rise against the eu institutions . 
  you mean - just like it happens right now ?
