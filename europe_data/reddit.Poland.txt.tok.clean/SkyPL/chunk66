  blaming stuff on eu is pretty much a common policy in many eu countries . 
  or a fat person * h\u00e4nde hoch *, 
  youtube profile with 1 video upload , and a surprisingly well-done one ... almost as well as the last loud video from russian propaganda ... anyway : [ wikipedia coverage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malaysia_airlines_flight_17 )  in may 2015 novaya gazeta published a report by `` a group of russian military engineers '' that came to a conclusion that the airplane was shot down by a `` buk-m1 '' launcher with 9m38m1 missile . 
  authors also analysed the visible impact traces on the surface of the airplane and suggested that the missile could n't have been fired from snezhnoe , but it was instead fired from zaroschenskoe ( ukrainian : \u0417\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 ) and claimed that a ukrainian anti-air unit was dislocated there at that time . 
  [ 204 ] the security service of ukraine said that there were inaccuracies in this version , and called the part of the report a fake . 
  [ 205 ] russian military expert vadim lukashevich argued on tv rain that the spatial orientation of the rocket at the moment of explosion does not exclude the possibility that it was launched from snizhne , as the authors of the report claimed , but the report correctly admits that the `` buk '' missile was cause of the crash , debunking all the previous versions of the crash ( su-25 etc. ), 
  populated in russian media . 
  [ 206 ] also ukrainska pravda questioned claims about ukrainian anti-air unit and stated that zaroshchenskoe was under control of pro-russian forces on the day of shootdown . 
  [ 207 ] bild said that the satellite image was fake . 
   chances are you 'd be jumping out of a helicopter in some tiny , poor ass country ripping throats out like rambo . 
  is that how you recruit people to the marine corps ? 
   a benign world power that can be a political counterbalance to the us i doubt that would happen . 
  eu and us share way too many things to be a political counterbalance . 
  look no further than un and how eu countries tend to vote comparing to the us . 
  in vast majority of cases we share the same view . 
  if anything - eu would be a strong political supporter of the us ( though most likely nowhere near as much of a military support as individual countries are now ) . 
   but i 'd agree that most other europeans want the uk out . 
  sadly - uk worked hard on it during last 3 years or so . 
  back in a day you were one of the big trio , but in last years domestic rhetoric and british retreat from constructive engagement with other eu countries really turned it up side down . 
  i 'm still hopeful though . 
   ruch narodowy ( of which i am a member !, 
  home come you even got here ? 
  you know it 's one of the most pro-eu subreddits out there , right ? 
  it looks like a last place you want to be in - try visiting / r/european - you 'll find many more like-minded people there along with news that might interest you more than these here ( i see you never posted there , so i presume you do n't know about that subreddit - at a very least i 'll give you some new place to read news from ) . 
  you know what i see in these statistics ? 
  that the results were roughly identical to these from 2004 when czech republic joined the eu . 
  sometimes it 's been worse ( 2011 being highlight ) , sometimes it 's been better ( 2005 ) but it stays on roughly the same level . 
  i would say that you are reading way too much from this data . 
   so if opinion/politics can change that quickly against the eu , they did n't . 
  there 's nothing to discuss , really . 
  guy is confusing basic things and clearly has no knowledge about national politics . 
   we are independent as long as we have an army and the eu does n't . 
  most interesting definition of independence . 
   the opinion of the eu wo n't change back to positive it 's already positive . 
  it does n't have to change back  simply because po wo n't be at power anymore after the autumn elections , simply because pis wins elections it does n't mean poland will suddenly become eurosceptic country . 
  in fact lisbon treaty was approved by the votes of pis and pis president kaczy\u0144ski signed it , leading to further integration . 
   pro-eu brainwashing machine will stop working . 
  there is not `` pro-eu brainwashing machine '' 2 . 
  your post implies that after the elections we 'll have `` anti-eu brainwashing machine '' ... 
  that 's some very interesting maths you did there . 
  right and center-right wing parties in last year ep elections got 23 meps out of 51 , and these actually voting for euroscepticism got 4 meps out of 51 . 
  the support that most of right and centre-right wing parties got is n't related to euroscepticism ( pretty much only not-totally-meaningless party that 's got euroscepticism on a banners is ... wherever korwin is today ), 
  buahahahaha , no . 
  it wo n't . 
  no idea what twisted lack of logic made you arrive to that conclusion , but you could n't be any further from truth . 
  how is that a news ? 
  it was announced months , and months ago . 
  we actually do spent over 2 % on defence already - only it 's split in rather odd way ... we are still paying for f-16s , in most countries this kind of payments comes from ministry of defence ( which is what goes to `` defence budget '' statistics ) , in poland they are paid from minister of finance .

  it 's not a concentration camp . 
  and noone put them there . 
  they arrived there all by themselves and french did nothing to move them out . 
  border control meanwhile does n't allow them to get to britain . 
  so they just gather in rising numbers for years . 
  some eventually give up and move out while others smuggle themselves through the border illegally ( eg . 
  by cutting their way into the trucks ) . 
  but situation is getting worse and worse from year to year . 
  it 's a ticking bomb .

  google translate :  ** calais . 
  a brawl between migrants made 24 injured **  a brawl broke out between migrants in the night from sunday to monday in the camp of the `` new jungle '' in calais ( pas-de-calais ) , making 24 injured , 14 were hospitalized . 
  the fight would have opposed sudanese and eritreans , starting with a fire and tents degenerating and continuing with an iron bar shots . 
   some 200 to 300 migrants were involved , said the prefecture of pas-de-calais . 
  `` the situation was brought under control at all times , '' said the prefecture . 
  police department , including saint-omer and boulogne-sur-mer , intervened in support . 
  the prefecture said follow `` the situation very attentively , '' with `` a constantly suitable device . '', 
  it is a new incident for this wild camp who settled around the day care in place since the beginning of the year in an old activity center , which offers meals especially . 
  about 1 800 to 2 000 migrants have found refuge . 
   on the night of thursday to friday , a migrant was wounded by firearms , presumably as part of a struggle between smugglers . 
   approximately 2,500 migrants , according to the prefecture , including afghans , sudanese , eritreans and syrians living in tents or makeshift shelters in calais and its region where they try to enter britain . 
   in addition , a migrant died overturned on the a16 motorway between calais and boulogne , also at night . 
  we even had quite epic post about that , titled [ heads-up : popular neo-nazi site daily stormer is encouraging people to `` recruit '' on / r/europe because `` europeans tend to be much more racist and anti-jew than americans '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/ ), 
  [ inert gas asphyxiation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inert_gas_asphyxiation ) - from what i remember that 's the least painful kind of death . 
  from that wikipedia article :  this leads to asphyxiation ( death from lack of oxygen ) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation ( which in humans arises mostly from carbon dioxide levels rising ) , or the side effects of poisoning . 
  in a way you could say he was `` lucky '' - it 's a better kind of death than dying from , say , falling from heights ( which is quite common type of accidents during a construction works ) . 
   we have the fourth-oldest constitution in europe [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_constitutions ) that san marino , netherlands , norway , belgium and denmark got older . 
  very interesting list none the less . 
  quite ironic that `` usa won the space race '' and now russians are delivering us astronauts to the space station build on a core russian module . 
  and if you 'll look a little bit back - the first space station was from the ussr - salyut 1 .
