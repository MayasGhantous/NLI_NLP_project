  but still - we own 20 % of the list , hehehe, 
   germany ( ... ) can overrule france it actually can not . 
  not on it 's own . 
  it 'd need to build an alliance across the eu and seeing responses so far it seems that france will have it much easier to build their own alliance against the proposition . 
   every stupid eu policy -- like the euro or the common agricultural policy i chuckled . 
  poles . 
  ^ we need more people posting in czech along with english like that . 
  not just french doing that . 
  [ story ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonization_attempts_by_poland#second_polish_republic ), 
  i 'm much more interested in someone finally dismantling fifanostra than where does this or other world cup takes place . 
  they published prices for household consumers , including taxation . 
  ( [ direct link ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/electricity_and_natural_gas_price_statistics#natural_gas_prices_for_household_consumers ) ) but mind you - it 's a country average , so might not match exact values on your bill . 
  quite interesting map considering that in poland people think that we 've got the highest gas prices in the entire europe . 
  in before jokes about polish pilots ignoring taws warning and [ crashing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) into the ground ... 
  seeing that even pakistan can be an associate member i say : sure , why not ? 
   the immigration law was changed something like 16 times during the previous government . 
  that sounds crazy . 
  as someone from a country where immigration law was changed once in last 12 years or so i wonder what 's the reason for so many changes in such a short amount of time ? 
  build solar farms and crop energy ? 
  nice . 
  it will save a lot of money - now you can just take all the banners , posters , stickers , t-shirts , etc. 
  from `` yes '' campagin in scotland , paint over stripes into stars and we 're done !, 
  pretty much all of the headlines are just as applicable . 
  corrected . 
  it 's also the one that degenerated more in terms of quality . 
  and as far as i 'm aware neither of these newspapers publish anything in english . 
  well on wikipedia list of examples [ poland does n't have one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newspaper_of_record#examples ) and i tend to think that 's because simply we do n't have one . 
  back in 90s we had some newspapers that could be considered * newspaper of record * but in ' 00s quality really declined . 
  i guess two closest would be [ rzeczpospolita ] ( http://www4.rp.pl/ ) and [ gazeta wyborcza ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/ ) though sometimes quality of the articles is so awful you can be certain that even interns would n't write crap like that ( and i 'm not talking here only about quality of the content , but even grammatical and spelling mistakes ) . 
  that 's not the case though . 
  [ russia clearly wins ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap ) in terms of exercises conducted and nato does n't even attempt to come anywhere close to them . 
  less than in most of other eu countries , in fact poland has one of the lowest percentage of people wanting to leave the eu of all member states . 
  `` 100 jets '' sounds perhaps huge , but in reality it 's 3 times smaller exercise than the one russians make in terms of personnel involved . 
  [ imdb ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802154/ ) - i actually own a copy of this movie but never got around watching it ... 
  i feel encouraged going back it , 
   ex machina is the smartest science fiction movie since prometheus . 
  that 's a weird * compliment * considering that prometheus made a name for itself by having the dumbest run away scene in a history of sci-fi . 
  it 's stupid to the point where `` prometheus school of running away from things '' became a meme and a reference to just how stupid a scene in a movie can become . 
  that fits perfectly what he said . 
  in poland there is no discussion about `` staying in the eu '' - we are a part of the eu , period . 
  it 's not a matter of `` in/out '' , it 's `` we are '' . 
  so what we consider `` eurosceptic '' in uk would be considered `` pro-eu '' . 
  [ until you realize that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_population_transfers_%281944%e2%80%9346%29 ) . 
   i was talking about latvian constitution , oh , i know , i just tried to explain how it is in poland , because you did n't know  sorry , my post was slightly confusing . 
   i do n't know about polish constitution , but here it can be changed just as easily as any other law , no , it can not . 
  you 'd need 2/3 majority with over 50 % mps present , which was n't possible to obtain for any proposed changes of the constitution since 90s . 
   and even if it was n't the case i fail to see how legislation being harder to change makes marriage illegal rather than unrecognized . 
  same here . 
  i 'm not an english expert , but `` illegal '' means forbidden by law , usually used in a context of criminal law . 
  here it 's not recognized - you can make a wedding on your own , you wo n't be punished for that , but civil registry will not grant you any official ceremony nor documents confirming your marriage ( which means you wo n't have any privileges related to it ) . 
  / u/nieuchwytnyuchwyt has a point - `` unrecognized '' would be closer to truth than `` illegal '' . 
  this and a fact that spain suffered very painful terrorist attacks make it perfectly understandable . 
  hahaha , good joke , i laughed , 
   would be such a huge boost would it ? 
  last time i checked someone was talking about additional 0.5 % gdp growth in the eu . 
  i can live without that 0.5 % ... 
  russians divide tanks to 5 generations , canadians or chinese to 3 generations , poles and germans do n't at all , etc. 
  there is no split of tanks into generations in the way jet fighters do split . 
  it 's 152mm tank gun . 
  here is an [ image of an earlier prototype equipped with 152mm tank gun ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wl8hve9.jpg ) . 
  artillery is a separate topic , separate design priorities , even though it 's using the same caliber . 
  and i do realize how large it would be , but i also realize it 'd be build on a new platform , designed from ground up to handle this gun , it would n't be an upgrade to leopard 2 . 
   you can apply band-aids hardly a band aid once you know how little the first production version of leopard 2 and current a7 share . 
   but western tank development only got away with it due to an utter lack of opposing tank and anti-tank development programs by which standards are set same can be said about everyone . 
  and considering that western tanks are arguably the best in a world - your conclusion might just as well be that all worldwide inventories are '' * for all intents and purposes 20 years old * '' . 
   in any case , any tank that potentially replaces any of the major western tanks would likely incorporate so many new features previously unavailable for existing tanks we 're talking here about western tanks , not russian . 
  there might be some fundamental upgrades , but vast majority of tech is ( or will be ) available for older tanks just as well . 
  current nato tanks already incorporate tons of newest technologies , you ca n't really make a leap like russians did . 
  they badly needed a new platform as t-72 was crippling their efforts to incorporate modern or even some of the older technologies . 
   you can be sure that the media itself will pick up on the `` next generation tank '' hype i prefer not to judge things by media hype . 
  otherwise i would believe that a-10 is the best thing in the universe for infantry soldiers ... 
  no , i did n't . 
  but i did n't mention it precisely because of the purpose you already listed . 
   you are correct about this possibility , however it 's still nowhere near as involved for national industry as developing own tank from ground up is . 
  in the end though - it will be mostly political decision , and i ca n't really predict that . 
  every tank is a compromise . 
  i gave 155mm as an example precisely because of nato standardization - 155mm rounds are a nato standard , so some could potentially be used out of the box . 
  of course you 'd need to develop few new rounds , like apds , but it 's not a whole new family . 
  and you ca n't be serious with that 100t text . 
  t-14 weights 48t and it 's already build to handle 152mm main gun turret . 
  of course it will be heavier with bigger gun , but `` approach the 100t mark '' is a gross overstatement . 
  as for the overkill aspect - we 're talking here about making a tank that will serve next 30-40 years and a current one already is said to have too low caliber gun . 
  next step would be 140mm , but nato does n't have any standardized rounds around this caliber , so natural choice would be 155mm . 
  but do n't get me wrong - i think that raising caliber is what 's necessary , not exactly raising it up to 155 , it might be more feasible to develop whole family of ~ 140mm rounds , though that 's far greater logistical challenge than it looks on a first glance . 
  in either case - you do n't need a new tank for etc gun , if germans are developing something new - it 'd be in their best interest to build it ready for higher calibers . 
  here 's the whole movie - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyprhozqby - watch all of it , really worth it , 
   quite the opposite . 
  there are a number of limitations with the challanger 2 i never said that challenger 2 does n't have any limitations . 
   it has after all been around 20-30 years since the last generation of tanks no , it was n't . 
  first of all - tanks do n't split into the generations like jet fighters do . 
  and secondly - the latest `` generation '' ( if you prefer to use that ) of european tanks is less than 10 years old . 
  you are n't up to date with leopard 2 upgrades . 
  the fact that tank is build on the same frame does n't mean that it 's the same tank . 
   there is a likelihood that a new gun might keep the same 120mm calibre but ... if turret would be capable of upgrading to larger caliber gun . 
  they might do it in a way russians did - release tank with proven gun first and then make an upgrade to higher calibre when it 's ready / deemed necessary . 
   but instead incorporate new methods for the gun mechanics altogether as an etc tank gun 120mm etc gun does n't offer the same energies that conventional gun of ~ 150mm caliber can . 
  and you do n't need a new tank for using etc gun - leopards 2 could be upgraded for that . 
   mbt-70 project was a whole other kettle of fish yes it was , i mentioned it mostly as an example of another nato large-caliber mbt development , not because it 's similar project to this one . 
   while a combined franco-german project makes sense to a degree it does , to a degree it does n't . 
  imho overall it might be more beneficial not to do a joined project but just some components , like targeting systems .
