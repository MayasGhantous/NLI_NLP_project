  french much like other eu nations with their own indigenous mbts build them to support their own industry , including design and r&d , with joined project a lot of it moves away from them . 
  and mbts usually are n't particularly expensive to develop , it 's nowhere near the level of developing a new fighter . 
   i wonder where that will leave the uk and italy exactly where they were to date . 
  neither of these countries has a desire to develop a new mbt . 
  challenger 2 still has the best armor in the world ( the famous `` hit by 70 rpgs , no causalities '' story ) , and italy is starting production of ariete mk .2 this year , so i ca n't see them already thinking about the next tank . 
   all the other countries in the eu currently operating leopards , will they get involved ? 
  some might be interested , but i doubt it 'd come into fruition with current defence budgets across nato . 
  most of the countries increasing budgets do it because they have much more urgent needs than mbts . 
  that * leopard * never hit production lines . 
  so there was n't any exception . 
  when us took it for evaluation they were shocked by just how far ahead of anything they have it was . 
  i would n't worry about fuck up seeing what you do to leopard 2 ( eg . 
  revolution upgrade ) . 
  i would worry about going into high cost overruns . 
  especially seeing that for some reason you want to make it in a cooperation with french , and projects involving more than one country are always more prone to large cost overruns . 
  wow ... really ? 
  that 's something new . 
  though this whole `` catch up with russia '' statement from the news is grossly overblown - it 's russia that 's catching up with nato , not the other way around . 
  closer statement would be `` to stay two steps ahead of russia '' . 
  but i understand why they used it - otherwise it 'd be a hard sell to the public . 
  i would expect the most important upgrade to be a new , higher calibre main gun , probably 155mm , to ensure capability of killing russian tanks from up front , something that 's estimated to be impossible with [ t-14 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-14_armata ) and uparmored t-90 when using current 120mm l/55 gun with conventional shells ( american depleted uranium shells that can be used by leopards are estimated to be capable of dealing with t-90 up front , but not t-14 ) . 
  interestingly enough [ mbt-70 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mbt-70 ) that was originally planned to replace leopard 1 was armed in 152mm gun , but the gun was very problematic and after overrunning costs by 5 times project was cancelled - lessons learned helped developing m1 abrams and first leopard 2 . 
  i would also expect integrating [ amap-ads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amap-ads ) which is german active defence system , arguably the best in the world , though it 's rumoured to be integrated into future upgrades of leopard 2 as well . 
   they were unimportant party before they were largest opposition party to sld government and then pis government . 
  that 's as far from `` unimportant party '' as it possibly gets . 
  it 's pis that was 4th party in a parliament before winning elections in 2005 . 
   they did huge fptp propaganda campaign no they did not , not during the elections , they did some campaign for referendum but it was in 2004 , a year before the parliamentary elections , but even then it was n't as large topic as it is now , it was mostly campaigning on a low-level structures , not a country-wide discussion , certainly nowhere near the level it is now . 
   but yeah , my bad , should have been more precise . 
  your bad is in having false informations , not in being imprecise . 
   but he voiced his political support towards it on numerous occasions there 's nothing wrong with voicing your support when you see reasonable proposals being raised and you want to see them implemented . 
   he 's a part of the system since 1989 . 
  uuuuu ... the evil * system * . 
  go fearmongering to the nearest classroom , perhaps there it will work . 
   it 's silly to think that his party is more than a decoy . 
  of course it 's not a decoy . 
  it 's like saying that pis was an aws decoy ( and back in a day they actually had more in common with themselves than po and nowoczesnapl does ) . 
   po won the first elections with propaganda for fptp , that 's absolutely false . 
  they won their first elections promising * normality * after pis government . 
  fptp was n't even a subject of discussions during the campaign . 
  the main subjects of factual debate were circling around `` liberality '' and `` solidarity '' in a model of the country . 
  but even that was n't the reason why po won - it was specifically what pis did during their government and people wanting more balanced , liberal government - po was most active in promoting themselves as these delivering that . 
   gathered a few millions signatures on the petition that was long before the elections , request went to sejm and because pis was governing party - it was dismissed . 
   then after they won elections they ignored the matter altogether for 8 years , and destroyed these signatures instead of doing the promised referendum . 
  so they did . 
  but it was n't a subject of the debate until kukiz popped up with the topic during these presidential elections campaign . 
  and even then most of his voters are voting against po as such , or even : against `` establishment '' , not for the single member district voting system or in a protest to destroying the signatures you mentioned . 
  from what i seen - the subject of referendum about 6 years old going to school was raised more often as an example in discussions than that old referendum proposal . 
  you 've been out of the country in last year ? 
  balcerowicz was constantly fighting po over national debt and ofe . 
  where he voted his strong support was in extending retirement age , but no wonder - every non-socialist and non-populist was supporting this change . 
   who will vote him ? 
  centrist voters . 
   othreatens to tear europe apart . 
  overly dramatic title is good to lure readers , but that 's about it . 
  contract was signed in 2010 , russia is assembling drones by itself from parts provided by israel , assembly begun in early 2013 , first deliveries of parts and drones for evaluation begun at the end of 2010/early 2011 . 
  in poland : * insulting president or other constitutional bodies * displaying or using communist , nazi and fascist symbols ( exceptions being made for historians and education system , this law is rarely executed in regards of communist symbols ) * defamation * holocaust , communist and other genocide or war crimes denial * creating political parties that relate to communism , nazism , fascism , racism , national origin discrimination , using violence to obtain power or affect politics , having secret membership or structures * publicly promoting communist or fascist systems , racism , national origin discrimination , ethnic or religious discrimination * insulting religious feelings ( exceptions were made for artistic expression and it 's rarely executed law , over 90 % of complains are dismissed on an initial reckoning , but most of the cases where people are punished based on this paragraph go to the media as an existence of this law very controversial ) from some other source : [ freedom world ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/poland ) : political rights : 38/40 ; civil liberties : 55/60 ; ( to compare [ us ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/united-states ) : 37/40 and 55/60 ), 
  lol . 
  could n't think of any more naive statement . 
  and it 's naive on multiple levels - from thinking that there 's some party to take the government from either of these two , to thinking there is some reason for people to start emigrating more than they did in 2004-2006 when we had a peak in number of new emigrants . 
  by december 2002 ( before joining ) - it actually did meet all of the requirements . 
  far cry from `` half the country '', 
  anything new happened since the time it was all over the european media right after the event ? 
  there are matters that should be centralized - like planning motorways , deciding about foreign or military matters , taxation rules , etc. 
  - and there are things that could be easily left on a local level - like opening new schools , kindergardens , etc. 
  eurostate due to it 's sheer size would have a huge trouble micro-managing on the same level current national governments do , therefore it 'd be better to leave more responsibilities in a hands of local councils . 
  you cut high level bureaucracy and give more power in a hands of * the people * . 
  it will exist in eurostate just as it does in nationstate . 
  if anything - eurostate might give more freedom for people to govern themselves on a local level than most of current european countries do as most of eu countries have a very concentrated power models on a national level instead of having it much more dispersed to a local level . 
  you asked which european countries need this capacity - i gave you an answer . 
  that 's all . 
   if each country had its own policy , then at least a few countries might not make the same bad decisions , and the ecological basis for fishing in the future might not be completely ruined . 
  when it comes to * ecological basis for fishing * it 's enough that one country makes a bad decision and consequences are disastrous . 
   if a decision is proven to be good , it will eventually be copied or adapted by other countries i wish it 'd actually work this way , but it very , very rarely happens . 
  brutal reality of politics around the europe is that every country is trying to reinvent the wheel on it 's own , all the time . 
  pretty much the only cases where good decisions are duplicated across the eu member states is when it 's an eu law that 's required to be implemented by all members . 
  out of pure political will it 's , as already said : a very , very rare occurrence . 
  eu council \u2260 eu parliment, 
  seeing what things they count as an * invasion * for this map : someone at some point of history gave a bun to romanian citizen . 
  it counts as an invasion through trojan horse in a digestive system . 
  french and british come first in mind . 
  having overseas territories means that you want a force projection capability , otherwise you ca n't defend your own soil . 
  i do n't know why people have so much of a problem with that . 
  slovak ** ia ** - czech ** ia ** . 
  looks good to me . 
  china is not forming any union and it 's not interested in small , poor countries like kyrgyzstan . 
  intervention in lybia got little to do with isis . 
  it 's a different continent . 
  and tons of immigrants come mostly from sub-saharan africa - again : completely different area than the one where us was fighting wars . 
  ukraine intended to cut off itself from russia , neither eu nor usa had to do anything for that to happen . 
  and they wanted to leave russia because they 're not blind - they see the success of eastern block countries in the eu and they want to follow that path instead of corrupt pro-russian government that failed them for 20 years . 
  and it 's eu that 's pulling them away from russia , not usa , but that happens because russia failed , not because eu or us * intended to cut them off * . 
  zero . 
  to my experience people that actually end with successful and growing companies do not call them `` start ups '' but rather just get onto it and run regular , new company . 
  `` start-up mentality '' seems to be more of a poison than a way to success . 
  a very specific type of a new business . 
  [ start-up company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/startup_company ), 
  last time we got few suitcases of benjamin franklins ... stop dumping prices !, 
  nope , still working on it . 
  sadly in january it got another delay , this time some australian company responsible for environmental studies failed to fulfil contract in time , so they decided to find a new one . 
  currently it 's predicted that powerplant will be finished after 2027 .
