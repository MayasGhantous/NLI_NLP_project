  poland is screwed . 
  bad in [ solar energy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35u8ab/map_of_europes_solar_potential_the_amount_of/ ) , bad in wind energy , bad in geothermal , bad in tidal ( baltic sea is way too small for that ) , bad in hydroelectricity ( flat riverbeds really do n't help ) ... 
  any clues about the reason ? 
  we 're closed , sorry . 
  guantanamo it is . 
  it 's more of a curiosity that something that has any practical value or is used in modern polish . 
  i recall it 's something that was used back in 19th or 18th century ? 
  anyway - imagine that you learn polish language - knowing this word has less practical value than knowing 175 letters long word i quoted above . 
   as far as i know , one can not vote specific people into the european parliament why not ? 
  if you have enough support you can start in eu elections and win them even as an independent candidate . 
  look at [ ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_members_of_the_european_parliament_for_ireland,_2014%e2%80%9319 ) that has 4 meps that did n't have any national political party backing them during the elections . 
  `` what happened in your country this week ? '', 
  posts are easily my favourite on this reddit . 
  ( [ last one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/368ipl/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_17052015/ ) ), 
  practically tough ... , 
   the least european country really ? 
   in grammar , a conjunction ( abbreviated conj or cnj ) is a part of speech that connects words , sentences , phrases , or clauses i guess it depends where you look for your definition . 
  i was tough at school that these are n't words . 
  but i wo n't argue much , i 'm not a linguist . 
  ... you high ? 
  only ... queen is n't actually a leader even in uk . 
  i think he was thinking more in lines of [ technocracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technocracy ) . 
  definitely yes , though it 'd require a lot of unifications and changes before it can happen . 
  veto right would need to be dumped , common foreign policy would need to be established and proven to work well before we can move on , energy union and within eurozone : fiscal union . 
  euda would need to have it 's competences significantly increased and more pan-european military projects would need to be established before we can have eu army . 
  opt outs would need to be minimized ( eg . 
  all eu countries should join schengen zone ) but at the same time polices would have to be more balanced , and eu should have some limits set on how far it can go with micro-management . 
  as for which model to choose - i do n't think eu should follow either us , uk nor switzerland - i think eu should work out it 's own model tailored to it 's unique needs and diversity . 
  oh , and another important thing : for eu to unite we 'd have to stop expanding . 
  in my opinion unification of ever-expanding union is not possible . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  global hawk is completely different class of uavs - it 's hale drone , not male . 
  the closest us equivalent is [ avenger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_atomics_avenger ) / reaper/predator family, 
  taranis is not a male drone , it 's ucav , an equivalent to [ neuron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dassault_neuron ) , both of which are being merged into european ucav . 
   they 'll probably pick up us drones in the meantime they probably wo n't . 
  the goal of these billions spent on uavs is to have european drones , buying us systems would only hurt existing programmes . 
  if anything - germany would be reviving euro hawk , but that 's hale drone with no equivalent being developed in europe . 
  yea , it would , but euro collapse would have tremendous repercussions for europe , digging us into greater financial crisis than any we 've seen in last 25 years . 
  to make things worse - an importance of europe in the world would significantly decrease . 
  conjunctions are not words . 
  and i do n't care if other people make mistakes , i want to do it right  , 
  it 's a name of chemical compound . 
  these are extremely long in many languages and ... well ... imho : it does n't really count .

  [ edit ] apparently `` u '' ( at ) , `` w '' ( in ) , `` z '' ( with ) , `` o '' ( about ) are words too , so we have some single-letter words as well . 
  currently russia mines only 5 % of global uranium output . 
  largest share belongs to kazakhstan , 36 % , next is canada with 15 % and australia with 12 % .

  i did some quick search and eastern poland is actually the safest part of the country when it comes to any sort of criminal activity , with a special mention to south-east ( bieszczady mountains ) for having the safest voivodeship ( both : in total statistics and per 1000 citizens ) . 
  if there 's some place to avoid in eastern side of the country - it 's the capital city , warsaw . 
  the highest numbers of reported criminal activity are in lower silesia and upper silesia . 
  in regards of homicides - your chances to get killed - north-western part of the country is the most dangerous one . 
  the safest one is in central poland , but south-eastern part comes second , and whole eastern part of the country having below-average homicide numbers .

  we can take it , you know ? 
  `` eastern europe '' as something that includes czech people was in common use only after ww2 . 
  before that it was usually described as central or western europe ( think : eastern / western catholic church split ) . 
   if `` eastern europe '' applies only to russia and belarus but it does n't . 
  there 's also ukraine and sometimes also moldova . 
   depending on what 's relevant right now ? 
  in that case it 'd only be relevant when talking about events between 1945 and 1990, 
  [ aye ] ( http://www.esa.int/pol/esa_in_your_country/poland ), 
  nah , poland is the best one in that !, 
  we 're so awesome that we speak the most compex language in the world an immigrants no pasaran !, 
  or maybe it 's just that we 're not rich enough ? 
  facebook provides service to the eu citizens - facebook needs to comply with eu privacy laws . 
  if us does n't let them to do that - either they can move out or lobby to stop this nonsense .

   `` if you are claiming a right to privacy , for example , we roll two twenty-sided dice to determine your score , take away any debuffs -- low income , being foreign -- and measure it against the government 's own total . 
  sounds legit . 
  and at the same time talking about throwing away human rights act . 
  interesting how a right to privacy slips away ... 
  not as an independent state . 
  yep .

  as long as there is no russia there - we 're cool . 
  besides - let 's face it : neither poland nor lithuania can afford restoring that territory to any state of usability . 
  so germany picking it up would n't be nearly as bad option as it might look at the first glance . 
  stop using your logic here !, 
  poles have a mandatory quota of complaining about national social security , do n't you dare to interfere with fulfilling his duty !, 
  the option presented in a referendum was an alternative vote system . 
  it 's still single-member district voting . 
  it could help , but still would n't solve the problems with british voting system . 
  you misunderstood me . 
  i 'm not an advocate of one vs another . 
  i 'm an advocate of them both as a mean of reducing coal and gas dependence . 
  i would take a mix of nuclear and renewable .
