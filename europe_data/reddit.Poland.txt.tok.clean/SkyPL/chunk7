  noone is going to leave nato for eu army . 
   also , this might be a hard sell for member states who have historically been neutral about time they realize that they stopped being neutral years if not decades ago . 
  here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ybs0s/the_current_president_of_the_european_commission/, 
  you can write to meps from your country as well as to the commissioners . 
  if enough people would do that - they would take a notice , even in commission . 
  riots might be a bit extreme , but protest in front of eu commission would make a stand too .

   why would you want a 1gbps internet where you can only surf google with high speeds , but get throttled to 218kbps for netflix because your cable provider only supports canal + 's streaming service ? 
  that 's not how this iteration of law works . 
  if you want some remotely relevant example : think of getting worse pings while playing games online because your game * traffic * had to wait * in a main route * for someone elses netflix movie packets to pass through . 
  it 's more about traffic prioritization than us-style throttling of individual users . 
  that said though - it 's still a very bad law , basically killing network start-up companies that depend on high speed , low ping internet . 
  no final decision was made just yet . 
  battle is still going . 
  being replaced by young neofascists . 
  brilliant . 
  yep . 
  and before ukrainian crisis us was supporting media and parties attempting to prevent further unification of the eu . 
  not just french people . 
  it seems to be a view shared across the whole europe . 
  brooms not guns, 
  true . 
  very true . 
   german forces would not be allowed to participate . 
  they already participate . 
  eubg is not a branding scheme for individual operations . 
  it 's a regular rapid response force with permanently assigned forces . 
  and european army would n't replace or interfere with an armies of individual countries . 
  it 'd be an addition to them . 
  something build on top of existing structures to defend eu as such instead of interests of individual countries . 
  problem of eubg is in small size and illogical split ( eg . 
  single country being part of multiple groups ) . 
  if these can be resolved than we 'll have * de facto * functional european army . 
   their armies are the last thing countries are willing to give up re-read the post . 
  noone is talking about giving up their armies . 
  just giving eu a real fighting force . 
  just like current eu battlegroup , only stronger . 
   neither britain nor france is going to join a european army fyi : both britain and france are a founding members of eu battlegroup . 
  they could just reinforce , increase in size and simplify [ eubg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) . 
  and a prequel `` owl wars '' - how owls were fighting with other birds until the beat them into submission . 
  fiy : eu governments did not suspend their training and support programmes . 
  it 's just us . 
  did n't work in us , so they hope it 'll work in eu . 
  and yet nsa is hacking them , not the other way around . 
  nsa is not made of high school students . 
  routing traffic through switzerland and netherlands does n't make any difference for them . 
  individually they do n't , i already wrote about it under the topic i linked to ( and got downvoted into oblivion ) . 
  either belgium or eu as whole can affect swift . 
  and it 's position was already undermined by nsa . 
  and the precedence already exist with iran . 
  eu on russia . 
   excluding russia from the swift banking system would be a measure of last resort if the crisis in ukraine escalates , the british and polish foreign ministers said friday . 
  so technically it 's not just poland saying that , but britain too . 
  it 's in quite a bit of discord with [ latest threats from cameron ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y20e5/david_cameron_britain_could_take_russia_sanctions/ ) . 
   a whole range of potential sanctions options , so that we have maximum flexibility , maximum agility and maximum speed in reacting to any provocation , whether a breach of the minsk implementation or whether it 's a military offensive somewhere else in the donbas region . 
  it seems like even next russian offensive will not necessary trigger swift exclusion . 
  which is a shame . 
  where do i throw my money ? 
   bradford , the most muslim city in britain , an `` israel-free zone . '' ...  it 's all about 9/11 and bush and how they did that to get at iraq and afghanistan and all that . 
  people are angry with the jews for terrorizing muslims all over the world . 
  that 's what we were told in the community . 
  wow ... just ... wow ... reminds me of recent [ nazi topic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/ ) .

  [ glorious lithuania !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:lithuanian_state_in_13-15th_centuries.png ), 
  yes !, 
  poland can into love !, 
  hahaha :p, 
  could make a referendum across all of the eu countries . 
  uk ca n't threaten anyone with swift . 
  it 's not british . 
  they do n't have any right to exclude anyone from swift . 
  if anyone - belgium or european union as a whole got a right to make a decisions like that . 
  cameron plays a pr game , it 's got very little to deal with what he can or can not do . 
  that 's what poland been saying . 
  i guess french welcome that new thing . 
  finally they can make jokes about other nato soldiers too !, 
  paywalled, 
  - no transaction costs , which is a huge thing - no long-term risks related to transaction costs - price transparency ( huge advantage for exporters and importers ) - [ lower bond yields ] ( http://markets.ft.com/research/markets/bonds ) - investments from other eurozone countries - even though common currency certainly impacts that , this impact is impossible to measure , so think of it as a minor advantage - more political influence . 
  whatever we want it or not - core of the eu is eurozone . 
  but again : it 's something pretty much impossible to measure in any relative terms . 
  - helps with easier travel and tourism between the member states - in geopolitical sense eurozone makes member states and the eu a more influential player on the world stage ( that said though : it 's a soft power , not a hard one ) . 
  russia today should send you a job offer after that one here . 
  shush !, 
  that 's form a different book . 
  probably seen few begging on a street ( between their own country men that they somehow did not notice ) and made up their opinion based on that . 
  look at his posting history . 
  you are talking to some retarded nationalist . 
  do n't expect much . 
  if i can add something to support your claim , here is a quote by arthur schopenhauer , german philosopher :  ** the cheapest form of pride however is national pride . 
  ** for it reveals in the one thus afflicted the lack of individual qualities of which he could be proud , while he would not otherwise reach for what he shares with so many millions . 
  he who possesses significant personal merits will rather recognise the defects of his own nation , as he has them constantly before his eyes , most clearly . 
  but that poor blighter who has nothing in the world of which he can be proud , latches onto the last means of being proud , the nation to which he belongs to . 
  thus he recovers and is now in gratitude ready to defend with hands and feet all errors and follies which are its own . 
  i read if * farter * for some reason ... * goes away in shame *, 
  hehehe , [ that 's what i got ] ( https://whitemaleoppressor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/watering-hippies.png ), 
  you are a genius !, 
  :d hahahahaha though it 's a little bit scary - ** if ** those nationalists will figure it out too , then you wo n't be able to eat stupid ham & cheese sandwich without having one of them trying to * recruit * you , or something ... 
   producers who produce me-too shit along with `` provincial artists '' and lawyers who are in the food-chain have the most to lose from any reforms .
