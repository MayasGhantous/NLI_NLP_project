  in deed it was , that said though - choice in the referendum was between [ alternative vote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instant-runoff_voting ) and existing fptp system , both of which are [ single winner systems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_system#single-winner_methods ) . 
  proportional voting was n't in question during that [ referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_alternative_vote_referendum,_2011 ) . 
  to be honest i do n't even know what i would answer given these two options . 
  every european proportional representation system has a minimum threshold , usually it 's 5 % . 
  so no , they would n't get any mps ( that said though i would n't mind lowering it to 3 % or 2.5 % as / u/emnel mentioned , but that 's a topic for separate discussion ), 
   the party with the largest popular vote won the most seats . 
  you mean just [ like in 1979 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_1979 ) where labour won with 39.2 % to conservatives with 35.8 % and yet they got only 269 seats loosing to 339 seats for conservatives ? 
   it keeps out extremists i would say the opposite . 
  it 's pretty much the only system that allows coordinated extremists to get easy ticket into parliament . 
  just concentrate your efforts on some area where it 's easy to get a ticket into parliment and you 'll easily win against magnitudes larger , but more spread out parties . 
  take for example democratic unionist party and imagine they are extremists - with only 184,260 votes they have 8 seats in a parliament , 8 times more than greens with over one million voters supporting them or ukip with nearly 4 million voters supporting them . 
  party that in proportional system would be considered absolutely meaningless , fringe party , nowhere near getting to the parliment suddenly becomes 4th largest party in fptp system ( there 's a draw with libdem , but you get the point ) . 
  how that would strengthen them if they already enjoy veto ? 
  if anything it 'd be the opposite - smaller countries could finally outvote them with a sheer numbers . 
  germany is 15.92 % of eu population , france is 12.98 % of eu population . 
  or if you want to go by eu parliament seats : it 's 96 and 74 respectively . 
  out of 751 . 
  even 4 largest eu countries combined ( de , fr , gb , it ) do n't have enough power to obtain majority , and it 's not like they agree on everything in a first place . 
  i would swap / u/pfdwxenon '' * and foremost : kill the uk rebate . 
  * '' to '' * and foremost : kill the veto . 
  * '' there 's absolutely nothing good coming out of it and here in poland we 're quite allergic to that as a veto right was one of the reasons why the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth have fallen . 
   council is the only entity that does not represent the eu electorate as a whole , but strictly represents interests of individual state governments . 
  well , council is made of heads of state or government , so they do represent electorate . 
  but you are right that in the end more than often national interest overweight eu interest . 
  that said though - many meps do exactly the same . 
  just like many mps in national parliaments put an interests of their region ahead of what 's logical and good for the country as a whole . 
  they could make it an opt-in system ( as far as i hate all these opt-ins and opt-outs ) . 
  baltics joining together to form one army could be a very reasonable option giving them far more potential than they currently have . 
  democratic unionist party is what amazes me most . 
  they got as many votes as a population of some of the tiny cities in poland i never heard about ( eg . 
  '' * nak\u0142o nad noteci\u0105 * '' ) and they are ~ ~ 5th ~ ~ 4th ( tied ) largest party in a parliament with 8 seats while two parties with over 1 million votes got just one seat each . 
   to the political fringes rather than the political mainstream i thought that this is exactly what british system does . 
  look at [ the results so far ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results ) : * democratic unionist party - 184,260 votes ( 7th party by number of votes ) - ** 8 ** seats ( 4th ) * ukip - 3,830,029 votes ( 3rd party by number of votes ) - ** 1 ** seat ( 10th ) yea , yea , ukip is n't one of two largest parties , but it 's still seriously messed up when things like that happen . 
  british system basically allows extreme and * fringe * parties gain seats in a parliament that otherwise could n't possibly get anywhere near it as long as they concentrate their supporters in one area . 
   politics is n't meant to be easy and i thought politics were meant to represent people ... 
   and most people in this thread criticize fptp specifically . 
  amusing considering that the other reply to your post with 14 upvotes is a very precise and loud criticism to fptp . 
  the only reason why you do n't hear much more criticism directed at fptp is because people are unfamiliar with a term in a first place . 
   the voting system should n't be used as a tool in achieve immediate political goals . 
  noone said anything else . 
  but the voting system should be there to represent the opinion of people , and as someone said :  highly undemocratic system like this is dishonest at best . 
  --  thirdly , do n't confuse fptp with single-winner systems in general . 
  kukiz specifically wants [ fptp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-past-the-post_voting ) [ single-winner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single-member_district ) system based on the british one - the one that receives all that backlash here . 
  single-winner district voting system literally translates to polish '' * jednomandatowe okr\u0119gi wyborcze * '' which is what he has on a banners and if you 'll read through his website you 'll see that he clearly wants fptp implementation of it . 
   the fact he dislikes the current establishment does n't necessarily have any bearing on what he thinks is the best voting system in principle . 
  that 's very true . 
  but there are always * other factors * , none the less brutal reality is that fptp specifically favours two largest parties . 
  with fptp they would win zero * psl and sld won 28 and 27 seats respectively , with fptp psl would have 4-6 times as many seats as sld ( depends on a specific system ) * the largest winners in this system would be pis and po . 
  sorry , but fptp is absolutely undefeatable if you want parliament to represent public . 
  when party with 10 % of votes would get 0 seats in parliament it starts being a total nonsense . 
  besides , look at the british election results - ukip apparently got 12.6 % of votes and will get 1 seat out of 650 . 
  as far as i dislike ukip - i find their miserable loss in these elections not only unfair , but even undemocratic . 
  as wikipedia says :  a first-past-the-post election ( ... ) generally results over time in a two-party competition . 
  which is something generally perceived in poland as something really , really bad . 
  we want some new faces and new parties rising , not being permanently locked down into po-pis . 
  cause that 's what fptp effectively ensures . 
  here we found pawe\u0142 kukiz voter in upcoming polish presidential elections . 
  random fun fact about the guy : even though he is very much anti-establishment he actually wants single-member district voting system , the one that heavily favors existing establishment . 
  oh , the irony . 
  hahaha , i like how they are [ running around with flags ] ( https://youtu.be/wnes60bmtlg?t=59 ) - feels like settlers . 
  also : jesus flag . 
  it 's a [ plurality voting system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plurality_voting_system ) , or in other categorization : [ first-past-the-post ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-past-the-post_voting ) , [ single-member district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single-member_district ) voting . 
  on a side note : one of candidates getting a lot of media attention in upcoming polish presidential elections is a huge advocate of single-member district system , he does n't have any chances for winning the elections , but might come in 3rd . 
  personally i have no idea why anyone would want that other than the members of two largest parties ( which actually do n't like that idea ) ... 
  in yurop there can be only one ss !, 
  [ why japan ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-30653825 ) ? 
  they have n't found anything that would work well , not to mention the vast cultural differences . 
  definitely good . 
  it gives better perspectives for raising wealth . 
  lithuania , slovakia , romania - no shits were given about safety . 
  poland - proudly 0.1 better . 
  wow ... we really made some progress . 
  from 45.3 % in 2005 , second highest in the eu - to 25.8 % in 2013 , nearly the same level as uk ( 24.8 % ) , slightly above eu average ( 24.5 % ) . 
  interestingly enough - uk had exact the same level in 2005 as it does in 2013 , and germany actually went up , from 18.4 % to 20.3 % . 
  / u/glorious _ europe looks like a sockpuppet account . 
  just look at his posting history ... 
  that 's an analysis from the most reputable polish defence industry portal . 
  might be interesting read not only for the matters specific to the choice polish ministry of defence made , but also for a general description of patriot and it 's inherited problems . 
  these green trees in front of ruined reichstags ... amazing, 
   respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities  societies characterised by pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men, 
  really ? 
  i seen ads nearly everywhere - newspaper , billboards , youtube , google main page , numerous websites ... 
  i do n't know how you missed it . 
  i understand printed adverts might not appear in your area but at a very least you should have seen youtube spam with chrome and their campaign on a main page . 
  interesting . 
  i never seen anything like that , and use ff both : at home and work . 
  marketing , the reason why so many people us it is huge budget google got on pushing it to everyone . 
  you can run firefox without flash plugin if you want . 
  but i never had too many problems with it , yet alone '' * crusing all the time * '' , whatever that means . 
  open your process window and check if you have google update service running . 
  it 's installed by default and runs in background . 
  you probably want to turn it off just to be safe ( and save some resources ) . 
  expo 2015 is open till 31 october . 
  so plenty of time to visit it if anyone wants to . 
  and expos can actually be profitable . 
  not always are but in last expo - sanghai - they ended up earning $ 157 million . 
  i like it . 
  imho - that 's the best one in terms of design . 
  yea ... 
  i 'm confused what 's up with that .
