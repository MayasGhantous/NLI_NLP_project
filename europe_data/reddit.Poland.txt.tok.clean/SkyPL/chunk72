  next time we 'll upgrade to containers ? 
  depends on a person and place , really . 
  i spent 2 weeks in london , went back for more and i still have n't seen most of the attractions outside of the city center ( like kew gardens ) - there 's just so much to see . 
  you are using the same excuse stalin did . 
   understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometres through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle . 
  two wrongs do n't make it right , nor ever one wrong doing should be used as an excuse for another . 
  this is more specifically on rapes by soviets : * in germany : [ rape during the occupation of germany #soviet military ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_germany#soviet_military ) * in poland : [ rape during the liberation of poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_liberation_of_poland ) these were truly tragic events that soviet propaganda spent 45 years trying to hide , and russia continues ever since the fall of soviet union . 
  yes , and that 's precisely why vast majority of eu leaders will not be there . 
  cause it 's not a celebration of the end of world war 2 , it 's a display of russian power and mostly a propaganda show in style of these organized by north korea . 
   they will never reintegrate in society and keeping them in prisons for life costs a lot of money . 
  so ... you propose killing people to save money ? 
  i do n't know what to say ...  you know ; `` an eye for an eye '' . 
  sharia law , too much ? 
  you also forget that death penalty is not `` an eye for an eye '' . 
  not in cases you describe . 
  killing and raping a child are not the same thing . 
  killing multiple people and dying yourself is not the same thing . 
   tell me what is your opinion about this question . 
  it 's a horrible idea . 
  civilized societies move towards abolishing , not the opposite . 
  capital punishment does n't solve anything . 
  it actually might only encourage people to commit only more and more horrific acts ( in your * child rapist * example - after raping a child guy might just as well go and rampage the city with machine gun , cause he has nothing to loose now ) . 
  capital punishment is forbidden in the eu by the charter of fundamental rights of the european union . 
  greece was n't included in this statistic . 
  that 's all . 
  so ... for french it 's 17100 % ... jeez ... 
  here : [ qatar rafale deal worth $ 6.3 bn - contract between france and qatar for 24 dassault aviation-built rafale fighter jets ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/34dqdf/qatar_rafale_deal_worth_63bn_contract_between/ ), 
  that 's [ nowhere near as unusual as article suggests ] ( http://epthinktank.eu/2014/01/15/eu-citizenship-and-residence-permits-for-sale/ ), 
  it 's related to the [ quote from minister of economy ] ( http://gospodarka.dziennik.pl/news/artykuly/472458,wicepremier-janusz-piechocinski-ukraina-chce-od-nas-wegla-za-darmo.html ) and a deputy prime minister , janusz piechoci\u0144ski :  we hear that there 's an interest in polish coal from ukrainians , but under a condition that it 'd be free of charge . 
  i am disgruntled , if not to call it worse . 
  it 's clear that also in the import of coal ukrainian side is interested in internationalization of the conflict rest is pure speculation from random people . 
  thank you for clarifying !, 
  ... and qatar has a long history of using french fighters ( they used f1s and later 2000-5 ) ... and variants after upgrades made in last years are genuinely good , ... and french started to make some serious bids with them since 2007 . 
  in 2002 when poland was making it 's large purchase of fighters it was offered mirage 2000-5 instead of rafale . 
   what central europe really thinks about russia nice try , but that 's a question that 's impossible to answer , simply because central europe is not a one person with a very specific opinion on the matter . 
   the willingness of the czech president ( ... ) to attend ( ... ) was widely read as a symbolic break with central europe 's western orientation it was ?!, 
  i must have missed something ...  central europeans are economically more closely tied to russia than the rest of the union ; that 's a very misleading statement . 
  only [ 4.2 % ] ( https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/cze/ ) of ( already mentioned ) czech republic exports go to russia ( 3.56 % for hungary ) - while it 's more than 1.88 % of uk or 3.52 % of germany exports - it 's still relative small portion . 
  ^ ( ( source of data - the same as in a first link ) ^ )  it is also not a secret that russian money has infiltrated parts of the business and political elites in the post-communist countries . 
  hold your horses there . 
  it 's not `` post-communist countries '' - it 's almost entire eu . 
  french national front gets more russian money than all ( ? ), 
  of the parties in * post-communist * eu countries combined . 
   in fact , bulgarians tend to blame america rather than russia for the crisis in ukraine . 
  that 's actually visible even here , on / r/europe . 
   despite polish concerns over russia , the majority of poles oppose weapons deliveries to ukraine , and an even larger majority are reluctant to let ukrainians travel freely in the european union . 
  ( ... ) the answer may be less counterintuitive than we imagine . 
  poles have understandable doubts about the security guarantees proffered by nato and the european union that are rooted in their troubled history with western security guarantees and their obvious fear of facing the russian threat alone . 
  they were also burned by their support for america 's war in iraq . 
  this answer does n't answer anything . 
  let me try to approach it and give you some answers based on an internet comments from some most popular polish news sites : 1 . 
  types of weapons poland * manufactures are also types of weapons that ukrainians manufacture themselves . 
  and while many people think poland should sell weapons to ukraine - ukraine does not want any our equipment unless it 's free ( similar problem with coal - they also could use it , but do n't want to pay for it ) . 
  and even if poland would give weapons on a long-term credit - people still doubt if ukraine would be able to pay it back . 
  in public opinion money we have should be spent for building up domestic defense instead of ukrainian ( that 's directly related to what nytimes mentioned above ) . 
  there 's still a fear of escalating this war - many people think that any further escalation would mean an invasion on poland ( that 's related to the quote from [ former ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) president [ kaczynski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lech_kaczy%c5%84ski ) who said in 2008 : '' * today [ georgia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war ) , tomorrow ukraine , and later perhaps poland * '' - something that 's constantly reminded of by the largest opposition party pis currently lead by a twin-brother of former president ) ^ ( * read : polish-owned defense industry companies ) ps . 
  please , do n't ask me to defend these opinions , as imho poland should absolutely support ukraine with lethal weapons , including anti-tank missiles , provide training to ukrainian officers , and closely cooperate in evaluation of russian equipment used in a conflict , including performance of provided polish hardware in a field . 
  yep , classic , almost like from prl . 
  i like how this survey tries to make everyone answering it in a different line than the one desired by government as some evil bastards that sold their soul to eu in support to * inconceivable monstrosit * ies . 
   germany had a nuclear weapons program too which was n't anywhere near completion with next to no chances of having it done before loosing the war . 
  the only way nazis could develop nuclear weapons is if allies would leave them alone for good few years , what would n't have happened . 
  [ here you can have some read on a topic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nuclear_weapon_project )  the weapons like the amerika-bomber , the first jet fighter ( me-262 ) germany have n't had an economic potential to output enough amerika-bombers to make any significant damage to us and even if they could build enough of them - after first shock allies would use radars to detect and intercept them before any significant damage could be done . 
  germans lost battle of britain in 1940 despite of having much more favourable combat environment than they ever would while operating amerika bomber . 
  me-262 while brilliant weapon was difficult to manufacture , allies were learning how to [ counter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/messerschmitt_me_262#counter-jet_tactics ) them and started developing their own jets independently of germany ( [ us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bell_p-59_airacomet ) - 1942 and the first operational allied jet from [ uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gloster_meteor ) was build in 1943 , entered service july 1944 ) . 
   i do n't think the allies would ever have won without the ussr , and that 's not up to debate . 
  read some history books or something ? 
  if germany would win battle of stalingrad and followed that with a victory at kursk eventually winning war with ussr - it 'd still loose to allied bombers killing it 's economy ( and they would n't gain much from soviets due to scorched earth tactics they employed ) . 
  usa alone had greater economic and manpower output than germany at it 's height , and it 'd only get worse and worse as time goes on and us war output accelerates with germany unable to do any substantial damage to it ( here is some okish [ read about these differences ] ( http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=191649 ) )  this kind of historical revisionism serves little yes , in deed , which is exactly what you are doing . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  after war of the pacific was done - us & western allies could defeat germany on their own , without support of ussr , by a sheer advantage of numbers and nuclear weapons . 
  yes , it 'd take longer . 
  how much longer ? 
  now that 's up to debate . 
  few more generic questions , i know you are not an economist , or a politician , but just curious about your personal view , if you have any opinion on these matters : * what 's your view on how eu countries handle immigration ? 
  * what do you think eu ( or individual eu countries if it 's easier to answer ) is doing right and what do you think it 's doing wrong in it 's relation with african countries ? 
  * what europe should do to help african nations develop - if anything at all ( because we have people here who think europe does too much ) ? 
   european voters only vote for the european parliament , instead of having a say in who leads the eu that 's a very common misconception . 
  european council collects heads of states , which were democratically elected at this point or the other * . 
  same with council of the european union which contains elected ministers from each country . 
  european commission is more complicated , cause it 's members do n't need to go through any public elections , but they are selected from parties based on the results of parliamentary elections and then elected by parliment and/or council , both of which have democratic mandate ( in a huge simplification ) . 
  the fact that you do n't directly select a person for a position does n't mean that european voters had no say in other institutions than the parliment . 
  it can be easily compared to the national elections , where you do n't vote for each individual minister , but they are rather selected by the winning party * . 
  ^ ( * - minor remark here , in some countries it 's not mandatory to be elected , you can be nominated to the position by your party , without having any direct democratic mandate yourself . 
  polish constitution allows to nominate a minister or prime minister that never was voted for lower or upper chamber of parliament , ) [ ^ jacek ^ rostowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacek_rostowski ) ^ ( being one of best-known examples , serving as a finance minister without ever going through public elections . 
  you 'd be surprised how many countries allow that , and yet noone complains about it nearly as much as they do about eu institutions . ), 
   i believe that this indirect democracy system all modern western-style democracies are indirect . 
  not just eu . 
   i find it amazing that 2014 was the first year when a televised debate was held for the european elections . 
  which is a good thing , i believe , but more can surely be done . 
  i very much agree . 
  but i 'm hopeful about that - everything seems to be moving in a right direction , too slow for my liking , but still : in a right direction . 
  that 's very true . 
  he is actually one of few guys around willing to spend some time researching the topics he discusses . 
  sure , we might disagree on this or the other matter , but certainly he is one of better contributors around here . 
  kudos to you jeff !, 
  [ image ] ( http://www.bild.de/regional/duesseldorf/duesseldorf/politiker-entdeckt-mord-muster-des-nsu-40721826.bild.html ) - wow , they fucked up even that . 
  neonazis are dumb , ca n't even draw a simple logo on a map . 
  rough shape is there , but calling that '' * almost perfect nsu logo * '' is a huge overstatement of their * talents * . 
   if european citizens are left with a europe that uses only one language that is foreign to them europe wo n't use only one language in any foreseeable future . 
  as for eu institutions - most of the eu citizens got used to it years ago .
