  and somehow i have doubts the most commonly used language in the eu parliament suddenly changes to french when they debate in strasbourg  . 
   and with elected representatives they never see because being all the time in brussels much like with national members of parliament - you can never see them anywhere unless it 's an election time . 
  so it 's purely speculative point . 
  brussels actually works okish ... 
  it 's somewhere near the middle of line between north-east and south-west , 
  hehe , me too . 
  but well , it 's still less than half the size of [ * charles de gaulle * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_aircraft_carrier_charles_de_gaulle_%28r91%29 ) carrier or ww2 [ * akagi * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_aircraft_carrier_akagi ) . 
  [ something for better sense of scale ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:us_navy_091117-n-6233h-234_the_aircraft_carrier_uss_george_washington_%28cvn_73%29_and_the_japan_maritime_self-defense_force_helicopter_destroyer_js_hyuga_%28ddh_181%29_transit_the_pacific_ocean.jpg ) . 
  and it comes with all the things modern destroyers do , they even managed to push vls on it  . 
  size-wise it 's closer to [ * mistral * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mistral-class_amphibious_assault_ship ) than an actual carriers , that said though - helicopter destroyers are qualified as a sub-group of [ * helicopter carriers * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helicopter_carrier ) . 
  [ * izumo * - class ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/izumo-class_helicopter_destroyer ) is the one that starts pushing it , 248m long , 27 000t fully loaded , with deck long enough to operate stol fixed-wing aircrafts . 
  interesting considering that it 's one of most common arguments for `` eu wasting taxpayer money '' ( not just in terms of maintenance but also travel back and forth ), 
  is that something about joined german-ussr invasion of poland in 1939 ? 
   possibly a few other countries would leave as well , only if uk leaving would end up being an economic success - what by all means seems impossible to happen . 
   which is good only in a limited doses . 
   so far right is often about ... ... also : populism . 
   not corporatism . 
  actually - [ corporatism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporatism ) is linked to right-wing ideologies . 
  it 's left-wing that 's pro-social and anti-corporatism . 
   in my opinion nazis and fascists are something beetween both far-left and far-right . 
  and in reality nazis and fascists are [ far right parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazism#position_in_the_political_spectrum ) , at least according to majority of people more qualified to justify that than either you or me , but that 's a topic for rather long discussion and in some ways they were left-wing too , just read the article . 
  in before `` oh my got you are evil leftist ! '', 
  - sorry to disappoint you , but i 'm centrist . 
  5th of may is the first one that will include duda . 
   nobody is talking that 's absolutely not true . 
  yes , it could be much better , but saying that `` nobody is talking '' about elections is a total nonsense . 
   the last debate between the leaders of the main parties was yeeeeaaaaars ago . 
  that got nothing to deal with this campaign , as none of the big leaders start in elections . 
   i think the candidates should be forced to participate in public discussion on public tv . 
  it 's a democracy , not dictatorship . 
  noone can force them to do anything . 
   the president wo n't be there because he 's scared oh , i see we 're copying here statements from the candidate duda ? 
  well done sir , well done . 
   this is a joke . 
  polish politics are a joke .

  [ there stats are bs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/343f3a/desktop_linux_market_share_in_eu_by_country/cqr9gyd ) . 
  that 's all . 
  i call these stats bs . 
  mac is quite popular in corporate and company environment , and linux got quite large share too . 
  according to gemiusranking - largest polish web statistics bureau - linux got 1.52 % , macos x got 1.3 % . 
  and windows xp-8 .1 in total hold 74 % of market ( remaining of the web traffic is in mobile devices or other more obscure oses ) . 
  and that does n't include web servers which are dominated by linux in poland . 
  in before : this is not an official eu parliament magazine . 
  japan does the same , eg . 
  [ here is modern-day ise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jds_ise ) , still the same flag though not a battleship any more . 
  i wonder what 's the source of that ? 
  i tried to find any mention of polish delegation or anyone from embassy going to the celebrations and could n't find a thing . 
  embassy is open as usual , and there 's nothing in media or government websites mentioning either ambassador , any of the diplomats or anyone from poland going to these celebrations . 
  [ potato war is sooo 2013 ] ( http://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/24-01-2013/123575-russia_europe_potatoes-0/ ) . 
   what is the eu doing about the humanitarian situation in eastern ukraine ? 
  eu does quite a bit , but in the end people in donbass and other captured territories will be told that it 's an aid from russia ( eg . 
  [ from russian roulette , 12:10 -12:38 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lajopwwh4e4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=730 ) ) . 
  that 's a sad and brutal reality of this conflict . 
  lies on every level . 
  you new around here ? 
  `` western sepculation '' ? 
  whole advance into kharkov was as much of a `` western speculation '' as corridor is . 
  only after capturing mariupol there 's nothing stopping them from making a full corridor . 
  mariupol is the stronghold to prevent its creation . 
  looks like earlier predictions from ukrainians are about to become fact . 
  that 's really a shame . 
  seems that a corridor from crimea to attacked territories in eastern ukraine will become reality . 
   the only danger is ukip who are a tiny party who get a very unfair amount of media coverage . 
  one thing i know from my visits and time living in uk - every single newspaper i picked had at least one at least one article mentioning ukip . 
  it feels like ukip is the governing party in uk , or at a very least - largest opposition party . 
  cause you never hear so much about anyone else as you do about ukip . 
  eventually - yes . 
  these are fighters , so they would obviously fly . 
   it it was quite an interesting training exerciser for the air force - first of all small air forces rarely if ever conduct any formation flying in such a large number , and secondly - you rarely fly in a formation with an airplane of this size . 
  i would n't be surprised if for most or all of these pilots it was the first time . 
  so it was definitely worth it . 
   why would you go from warsaw to rzesz\u00f3w through krak\u00f3w ? 
  cause there 's already a motorway on a significant part of that route   s7 will be build anyway that 's not a motorway though , and i was thinking along the lines of actual motorways . 
  but yea , i get your point . 
  s7 and alike are good enough for most of the needs . 
   real problem would probably be rzesz\u00f3w - presz\u00f3w . 
  not the only real problem but certainly the biggest one we both can think of . 
  makes me wonder if anyone from romania can comment on what are the plans for infrastructure there - are you building anything from black sea to hungary in any foreseeable future ? 
  constan\u0163a -  bucharest -  pite\u015fti is ready , but it 's almost a dead end . 
  hungary is in a best situation , though a bit from debrecen to oradea ( or wherever they 'd agree to meet with romanians ) would certainly need to be build if that idea is suppose to work, 
  that said though - i still laugh at the fact that they planned visiting [ brzesc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sko-upb6yo4 ) . 
   the best route for a corridor would be going through lviv , it 'd be great even if only for the reason that it 'd help with ukrainian economy , pull them a bit closer to the western europe and open some business opportunities for both : polish and romanian companies . 
  however building something like that would be borderline impossible , as ukraine can not afford it , and if eu is about to throw such an enormous sum of money to fund a construction of that motorway and then again offset for any financial losses due to corruption - they could find at least a dozen of better investments in infrastructure ( and not necessarily roads ) . 
  he is talking about a motorway from polish seaside - so it 'd be a bit longer than what you describe ... it would need to go from ... say : gdansk - a1 -  lodz - a2 -  warsaw - * new motorway * -  krak\u00f3w - a4 -  rzeszow - * new motorway * -  | border | - * new motorway * -  presov - d1 -  kosice -  - * new motorway * -  | border | - * new motorway * -  miskolc -- and so on ... and that 's re-using existing motorways ... if you 'd want to build it in a more direct way - it 'd be far more expensive and far more difficult to push forward due to political reasons . 
  in poland i doubt building motorway rzeszow -  warsaw is possible before building one to krakow . 
  in slovakia motorway from presov to polish border will be equally problematic . 
  sure , a lot of money could be saved by re-using existing national ways , but then it does n't really make it a north-south corridor , does it ? 
  [ eu values ] ( http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/objectives_en.htm#values )  the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values , which are set out in article i-2 , are common to the member states . 
  moreover , the societies of the member states are characterised by pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men . 
  [ how you decide if country can enter into eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copenhagen_criteria )  membership requires that candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy , the rule of law , human rights , respect for and protection of minorities , the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union . 
  membership presupposes the candidate 's ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political , economic and monetary union . 
  gchq gave it to ** n ** sa . 
  it 's obviously not just shops but also vastly dominant population . 
  and if it is so - then yes . 
  first random obvious example : [ polish downtown ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_downtown_%28chicago%29 ) in chicago . 
  yes , very sure . 
  all of these shops aimed at indian population and some travel agencies offering trips specifically to india along with my british friends telling me that it 's one of indian neighborhoods could n't be a pure coincidence  . 
  it was a very nice visit - i had a good time , and food was really great .
