  but i did some google search and only mentions of anything similar come either from german publicists or comments from random people under the articles ( and even then i never seen that as any dominating rhetoric ) . 
  orban was viewed as more of an ally to russians than germany . 
   the loud voices of the russlandversteher are widely cited by the polish media and poles naturally make a connection to the `` steinbach issue '' i ca n't recall that either , and ca n't find any mentions of such connection . 
  if anything - gerhard schr\u00f6der is viewed in poland as a symbol of * russlandversteher * and in some more radical statements - a symbol of how * german buisness plays to russian interests * . 
  steinbach is a completely separate topic from ukraine that was pretty much a closed case in 2014 , she was a topic in media back in 2012 . 
   his is probably why germany underestimated the disastrous reaction in poland after polish representatives were excluded from the so-called `` normandy format '' ( russia , germany , france , and ukraine ) , the current framework of discussions aimed at resolving the crisis in ukraine . 
  poland feels that it has been purposefully omitted from a political process that is so crucial to its own interests and security and which has been one of the most important issues for polish diplomacy . 
  majority of politicians blame ukrainians for that as they did n't wanted poland to participate or blame po ( governing party ) and how they * did n't do enough * to get there . 
  that * disastrous reaction * ( imho quite an overstatement ) was focused mostly on internal affairs . 
   thus , a good test of the polish-german cooperation and trust will be the quick implementation of the resolutions of the 2014 nato summit , such as the establishment of a rapid reaction force with its headquarters in szczecin , on the polish coast . 
  it 's already established and functional . 
  on 10th of april it had it 's [ first exercise ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_118667.htm ) . 
  -- one thing not mentioned is federica mogherini and how badly she plays her role lacking knowledge not just about latest politics between eu , russia and ukraine , but even historical knowledge . 
  accepting her as a high representative for foreign affairs was widely criticised in poland . 
  her lack of competences was viewed as the reason for why eu foreign affairs went down the drain since the days of catherine ashton on a topic of eu-russia-ukraine triangle . 
  and a reason why i think that this :  finally , the eu 's policy in its neighbourhood needs a complete overhaul will be very , very difficult in a days when we have her as an eu foreign affairs representative . 
  these comments under the article ... feels like going back to youtube comments . 
  i mean what i said . 
  my first post should be more than clear . 
  i 'm out , not going to be trolled , sorry to break your fun . 
  re-read my post . 
  you clearly do n't understand what i said . 
  i 'm not saying anything bad about german carbon emission policy nor anything about change in emissions , but rather actual , current emissions . 
  and yet still have higher emissions per capita than poland which is constantly criticised for using coal and having high emissions . 
  this map makes very little sense . 
  from the fact that we have deaths counted in tanzania ( that 's south-east africa ) through the fact that we have almost no deaths in turkish-syrian border , down to numerous problems with all these spots in a middle of europe ( i 'm quite sure that someone dying in coventry or these 2 people in manchester city center do n't really count as '' * would-be * '' migrants to the eu ) . 
  since 10 years ago : * european parliment got huge raise in powers and competences * co-decision process was implemented making sure that law passed through standard legislative procedure on the eu level has a democratic mandate from directly elected representatives in eu parliament * eu citizens can now write petitions to the eu parliment * voting in the eu council became public and transparent , same with general debates ( see : http://video.consilium.europa.eu/default.aspx ) * numerous other efforts were made to increase transparency , such as [ transparency register ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/homepage.do?redir=false&amp;locale=en ) and [ portal ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/index_en.htm ) or [ eu parliment plenary sessions ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/home.html ) . 
  * [ charter of fundamental rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union ) came in full effect . 
  i believe they are . 
  and target is 2 % since 2016 . 
  here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33doij/czechs_dont_want_the_euro/, 
  of course it 's not . 
  eu is actually moving towards being more and more democratic . 
  just look where eu was back 10 years ago and where it is now . 
  poland is second hardest working in the eu ... and yet we do n't have any enormous debt to work back ... 
  i feel pity for myself , and i demand at least one article a month about that . 
  oh yes , i seen it flying , truly majestic aircraft . 
  i really hope the second one will be completed . 
  but it 's an overkill for polish needs . 
  years ago us offered us a discount [ c-17 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_c-17_globemaster_iii ) s ( comparable with [ an-124 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonov_an-124_ruslan ) ) which are big enough to carry patriots , but even these were deemed too expensive in operations for polish mod budget . 
  that said though now , with patriot selected , i would n't be surprised if an idea of buying larger transport plane for the air force would return back on a table . 
  iron dome is one of the contenders for '' * narew * '' programme , which is a short range system . 
  currently it 's on a `` technical dialog '' stage with 9 companies invited . 
  next stage will begin in 2016 and winner will be selected at the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017 . 
  for medium range '' * wis\u0142a * '' programme one of the competitors of patriot was [ david 's sling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david%27s_sling ) - but it failed in a first stage of procurement along with [ meads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medium_extended_air_defense_system ) due to not being operational . 
  in early stages meads was seen as the best system offered , however it 's troubled fate along with lack of currently operational system excluded it from the second stage - which means that now the whole programme is in a financial trouble . 
  i really hope that germany and italy wo n't give up on it because it 's a very promising system . 
   i 'm just trying to get people to understand that criticizing the patriots based on the performance of the early generation in 1991 is n't valid at this point . 
  just to clarify so that other readers would n't get confused - the vast majority of criticism of patriots is based on a version that will be delivered to poland . 
  not any of the earlier versions . 
  they are doing server maintenance . 
  you 'll have to wait till it 's finished . 
  alternatively you can go [ here ] ( http://www.defence24.pl/analiza_przetarg-stulecia-wybor-politykow-czy-wojskowych ) and see two images - first one is with radar coverage ( text `` with standing arrays that see all '' ) and second one is an image of radar vehicle with large flat antenna in front and two small antennas in back . 
  well , in that case - it 's still pretty much the same . 
  there was always a shared consensus that everything that can be produced in poland - should be produced in poland . 
  opinions differ in what actually can be build here . 
  one of the success stories is [ kto rosomak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kto_rosomak ) nicknamed by taliban '' * the green demon * '' . 
  but we also got burned with f-16s where us companies did everything they could to avoid investing money in polish companies or sharing any technologies , even did some ridiculous scams like counting money spend on transporting parts and fighters as a part of investment offset . 
  offset for f-16s was a huge lesson for polish mod in avoiding holes and they promise future contracts with us companies will be much safer for the interests of poland . 
  now with patriots we will have a chance to see if in deed it 's going to be so . 
  yes , title of this article does n't make any sense . 
  if anything - he was n't paying attention to what happens , because [ measures taken by the eu ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33918q/european_10_point_plan_of_actions_in_response_to/ ) already account for pretty much everything he and philip hammond mentioned ( but to be fair - they might have been asked for a comment before eu decision was announced ) . 
  i just checked and it seems that poland plans to keep migs 29 till 2028 . 
  which means it 'll be retired in younger age than f-15c . 
  it wo n't cost anything near billions . 
  it 's poland , not usa . 
  we ca n't afford spending billions on a single ship in a first place , but also design and production costs in poland are much lower than in us . 
  as for emphasis - not much more than i noticed , no . 
  migs 29 are not going anywhere any time soon . 
  we upgraded them with modern digital , fully nato-compatible equipment . 
  they are still very capable fighters , being more up to date than most of f-15c still operated by us . 
  from what i recall there are plans to keep 29s till the end of 2020s . 
   you should n't be buying billion dollar amphibious assault ships when you 're still flying aircraft manufactured in the communist days . 
  if anything - we 'd build something ourselves . 
  as i pointed out in my [ previous post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33brl5/poland_will_buy_french_helicopters_and_american/cqjkaz3 ) there is an idea to build large ship for supporting polish troops participating in nato missions . 
  it would be a [ joint support ship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_support_ship ) able to carry 7 medium helicopters or 4 heavy , 2 lcus , 2-4 rhib and up to 550 troops . 
  but it 's still uncertain if this ship will be build at all . 
  and the way polish defense budget is spent means that funds for such vessel would n't affect funding of [ su-22 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-17#poland ) replacements when time arrives . 
  we manage our defense budget in quite an obscure way - for example payments for f-16s are separate from mod budget ( if you 'd sum them together poland would be safely above 2 % obligation for nato ) . 
  yes , no doubt about that . 
  as i mentioned in a first point of my list - patriot ng is a brand new system still in development , it has very little in common with the original system that took part in a gulf war . 
  that said though patriots have a long history of problems with accuracy of various versions , some [ random example ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/030321-patriot03.htm ) in regards of latest pac-3 :  in practice , pac-3 's performance has been questionable , at best . 
  early-stage developmental trials went well -- the patriots hit their targets 10 out of 11 times . 
  but more realistic operational assessments went less well , with only two `` kills '' in seven tries . 
  but we should n't forget that it 's alternative - samp/t - was n't battle-tested just like patriot ng . 
  so performance of both systems could be questioned . 
  still though seeing track record of aster and a track record of patriots - i have more faith in eurosam solution . 
  [ my answer to question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33brl5/poland_will_buy_french_helicopters_and_american/cqjku5a ) from must_warn_others should explain it . 
  not really , most of it is done behind closed doors and is quite important military and corporate secret . 
  i can only tell you what industry press - or specifically article i linked to - is criticising them for . 
  to make it as simple as possible : * one of the requirements was to have already completed and operational system , while patriot ng , variant poland is buying , is still in development ( including essential parts such as low cost interceptors , radar and c&c ) . 
  * it does n't fully satisfy the requirement for 360 degrees defence ( [ image ] ( http://www.defence24.pl/media/cache/slide/uploads/images/49ef0abe6e73d75275ac467eebff385e.jpg ) ) - it 's focused in one direction while having very inferior capabilities in other directions ( note [ one big antenna and 2 small ] ( http://www.defence24.pl/media/cache/slide/uploads/images/b482004d7ca86f9854c9e236b585ccb6.jpg ) ) * individual launchers are sector-based . 
  so you need to point every single one of them in right direction . 
  this makes deployment much more difficult and a loss of single vehicle far more crippling than in a case of samp/t . 
  * it 's not network-centric and modernization to that requirement is one of the lowest priorities on raytheon 's list . 
  to make it even worse - pac-2 interceptors are unable to work in network-centric environment . 
  * it 's not an open system . 
  it 's using proprietary interfaces and programming language , so we 'll never be able to plug our own components into the system unless they 're designed in cooperation with raytheon and coded by raytheon programmers ( mind you - specifics may vary depending on the contract ) * it 's a mobile system only on paper . 
  with 4 missile launchers , 226 oversized vehicles and 109 trailers you ca n't really talk about mobility . 
  and to make it worse - poland does n't have any airplanes or ships large enough to transport these vehicles , so it can be moved only by land , on a paved roads .
