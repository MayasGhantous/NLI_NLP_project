  * current radar vehicle alone weights 36t and is 17m long limiting it 's mobility through bridges and unpaved terrain . 
  planned radar for polish variant will be even heavier . 
  * final cost of several key elements of the system is unknown ( notably : radar ) - as far as it 's not really that important for this contract , as the price is already set , it might be painful if we 'd ever decide to expand our system with additional batteries . 
  * and something from me : noone is certain of it 's capabilities ( look : point 1 ) but the history of patriots is n't too encouraging ... to quote a quote from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mim-104_patriot#success_rate_vs._accuracy ) :  the patriot missile system was not the spectacular success in the persian gulf war that the american public was led to believe . 
  there is little evidence to prove that the patriot hit more than a few scud missiles launched by iraq during the gulf war , and there are some doubts about even these engagements . 
  the public and the united states congress were misled by definitive statements of success issued by administration and raytheon representatives during and after the war, 
   i dunno if mobile yes , they will be mobile , that was one of the most important requirements , though patriots as such are ... far from perfect when it comes to mobility . 
  it 's an enormous , slow convoy , and poland does n't have any planes large enough to transport it by air nor any ships capable of transporting it by sea . 
  here is a good article about [ planned modernization of polish navy ] ( http://www.militarium.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:plan-modernizacji-marynarki-wojennej-rp-do-2022-r&amp;catid=1:armie&amp;itemid=2 ) ( in polish ) - important part is the first table with planned ships and their roles . 
  few highlights : * 3 submarines with displacement of up to 2000t , capable of launching cruise missiles ( eg . 
  tomahawk ) * multi-role corvettes , 2000t displacement , equipped with medium range air-to-air missiles , anti-ship missiles , and anti-submarine torpedoes . 
  * 2 seaside missile divisions equipped with anti-ship missiles capable of also striking a ground targets . 
  * 2 maritime patrol/anti-submarine aircrafts ( casa persuader ) * 6 antisubmarine warfare helicopters * uavs : 22 tactical and 3 male * 15 000t displacement , 150m long command ship '' * marlin * '' - mostly designed to provide support for polish army on missions abroad ( it 's still rather uncertain if this ship will be build or not ), 
  eu as a whole . 
  we are trying to . 
  eu is the biggest donor of foreign aid in the world . 
   all of them are good motions , i was about to write a long post , but after 5th point i realized that there 's no point - every decision they made seems to be very good and very reasonable . 
  hopefully it 'll be implemented to full extent and bring some good results . 
   that 's the sad thing ? 
  it 's not . 
  i would n't be surprised if it 'd cost more than that . 
  creating logos for large corporations or institutions is a very complicated process . 
  and what you get in the end is n't just logo itself but an entire book of guidelines and use cases to cut the costs of rebranding . 
  still though we do n't need mistrals . 
  our closest hostile neighbour is russia - there 's absolutely no need for ships when you can reach them on a huge open plains . 
   we have much more urgent needs in our navy than amphibious assault ships . 
  for example submarines that we are about to purchase . 
  decision to choose patriots is disappointing . 
  these missiles , even in modernized version proposed by raytheon , do n't fulfil polish requirements on nearly all fronts - [ here is a long criticism of patriots for poland ] ( http://www.defence24.pl/analiza_przetarg-stulecia-wybor-politykow-czy-wojskowych ) ( in polish ) . 
  yes , the alternative system - samp/t - does n't fulfil all the requirements either but currently it 's much more capable and newer system with constant , very active development - thales & mbda offer poland partnership and cooperation in long term improvements of the system , something we 'll never have with raytheon once contract is completed and systems are delivered . 
  not to mention that each year more and more people talk in us about retiring patriots and developing a new missile defence system . 
  patriot is a great choice in current situation for political reasons , but in a long term perspective we might pay for it dearly . 
  picking caracal though does n't come of any surprise . 
  this was the most capable helicopter within the requirements , with much better offset proposed by eurocopter than the one for black hawk ( which was the other serious competitor ) . 
  so far we do agree . 
  i was thinking more in a line of europeans wanting to accept all immigrants with an open arms ( ' * give them boats to come here safely * ' kind of people that i seen in some [ other post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3383ox/mediterranean_distress_call_from_sinking_migrant/cqiet9z ) ) . 
  and i doubt africans believe this - most of those escaping wars actually do settle in neighbour countries . 
  otherwise we would n't have an immigration in hundreds of thousands but rather millions . 
  why ? 
  it 's not like they are taking these tanks from poland , or wherever else . 
  they are essentially pulling mothballed tanks into active service and modernizing these in need . 
   us can still do quite a lot of economic damage on its own if it wants to . 
  it really ca n't . 
  even if it 'd put full sanctions on all products and services - it would n't make much of a difference for russia . 
  eu is the major player here , not us . 
   imagine that poland has now more leo ii tanks than germany , which is crazy and sad . 
  there 's nothing crazy or sad in that . 
  in fact - it 's in germany 's best interest to make sure polish armed forces are as well equipped as possible , even if it means sacrificing some of their own equipment . 
   more tanks will be needed in the future . 
  yes . 
  definitely . 
  in a long term they should ramp up production and get some additional modern equipment in a field . 
  but in a short term getting mothballed tanks modernized and prepared is a good start . 
  also : libya is n't the only country in africa , and most of these migrants are not from libya nor any neighbour country - they are sub-saharan . 
  and finally - we should stop pretending that whole africa is in war and only safe place for them to be is in europe . 
  ^ i want to live in that 2030 . 
  still west from asia , north from africa . 
  that 's an incorrect description . 
  currently he is an advisor to the defense minister - he does n't have any decisive power , is n't a member of the government nor is responsible for anything . 
  he is advising on a reform of the military command and technical modernization . 
  * [ official website of the ship ] ( http://www.hermione2015.com/ ) * [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_frigate_hermione_%282012%29 ) and an entry for the [ original ship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_frigate_hermione_%281779%29 ) * [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqffmyycs_s ), 
  doubts like that are precisely what russians and putin play on to achieve their political and geostrategic goals , and i would n't be surprised if russia would try to use it to destroy nato . 
  [ here is the full interview ( in polish ) ] ( http://forsal.pl/artykuly/865904,skrzypczak-krwiozerczy-nacjonalizm-ukrainy-kijow-zupelnie-nie-liczy-sie-z-polska.html ) . 
  title of this article is very misleading . 
  he ca n't really back any support - he is a retired general , so there 's nothing much he can do to support or stop supporting ukrainians . 
  it got nothing to deal with official government line . 
  in the interview he quite specifically says that he can say things like the fragments quoted by rt because he is not a politician . 
  sorry , but it 's yet another example of rt twisting facts to fit kremlin narration . 
  hahaha, 
  there goes my joke :(, 
  in poland it 's not a subject of any debate . 
  if you hear anything in a context of '' * nuclear weapons * '' in poland - it 's about russians yet again deploying iskanders to threaten eu or the need of building anti-missile shield for poland . 
  in before anyone asks - we are in a process of aquiring ballistic missile defense ( currently gathering offers ) , but it will take at least few more years , why so late ? 
  because [ us cancelled it 's shield in poland to suck up to russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/us_missile_defense_complex_in_poland ) and for years we thought it 'd be the way to defend our cities from nukes if needed be . 
  '' * nazi taking soviet job * '' ... erm ... yea ... about that ... 
  hahahaha , good one . 
  i 'm sure brits will be very happy about that , 
  agreed . 
  great news !, 
  [ here is an official press release ] ( http://www.rolls-royce.com/news/press-releases/yr-2015/pr-170415rolls-royce-wins-largest-ever-order-from-emirates.aspx ) and here is the engine in question - [ rolls-royce trent 900 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rolls-royce_trent_900 ), 
  identical situation in poland . 
  president says something from time to time about euro , but it 's not even a subject during current presidential elections , yet alone general public debate . 
  according to reporters without borders it is . 
  click [ 1 ] in my previous post to see the source . 
  that 's because press in russia is in more dire situation than the one in ukraine . ^ ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php ), 
  noone says it will . 
  but again - people on these boats are not escaping civil war in libya , most of them are not from libya in a first place ( though most of the smugglers probably are ) . 
  i 'm just quoting . 
  it 's the ttip supporter who said that * we should do it quickly * . 
   an ineffectual government like the libyan one the support eu gives is mostly towards changing that state of things . 
   we should do it and we should do it quickly that 's something that always worries me about ttip - the way americans are pushing it to be something adopted as fast as possible . 
  if there 's anything experience with politics tells me it 's that when someone is trying to push something surprisingly quick comparing to how huge thing it is - it usually ends up with negative results . 
   the people that will benefit most are small companies right , yea ... sure ...  ttip is not going to lower us standards as if that would lowering us standards would ever be the subject of this debate ...  bilaterals.org site mentioned in a video : http://www.bilaterals.org/?-ttip - - look : * focus on : leaks & official docs *, 
  very sad event . 
  no matter what they write - journalists never should become a victims in any conflict , yet alone hundreds of kilometres away from the front-line in a shameful murder . 
  hopefully murderers will be brought to justice . 
  i also hope for a strong reaction from pro-ukrainian press , it 's one of these moments when solidarity is needed . 
  if it 's similar to the previous instances - these are not libyans , but rather sub-saharan migrants . 
  if you are interested in how eu helps libya [ here is the rough overview ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/node/454 ) . 
  so first you say '' * the point is not to force anything * '' and then you say '' * if you manage to push it * '' ?
