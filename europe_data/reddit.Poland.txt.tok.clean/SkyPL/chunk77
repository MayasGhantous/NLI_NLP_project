  people will learn english anyway , simply due to globalization . 
  english is becoming a global * lingua franca * whatever some people want it or not . 
  it is and it should be a natural process if any language is about to become pan-european . 
  eu should n't play any role in that other than encouraging countries to preserve their linguistic diversity as it does now . 
  there 's absolutely no reason to change current eu policy on that matter , as in my opinion it 's a very good policy that does n't attempt to stop natural cultural changes , while at the same time supports european heritage . 
  it 's a hyphen ... 
  is that * european * as in terms of the continent or * european * as in the european union ? 
  i 'll answer this for european identity = european union identity ( as in american identity = united states identity ) * respecting european values , having a feeling of belonging to the eu nation - thinking about it as a homeland , looking above nationalistic point of view of your own nation - having pan-eu perspective on at least some subjects . 
  * yes , i have a very strong feeling of attachment to the [ values of the european union ] ( http://europa.eu/scadplus/european_convention/objectives_en.htm#values ) . 
  other than that i 'm not too attached to material things - eg . 
  when i think about poland i never think about warsaw or polish flag . 
  what for ? 
  there 's no point . 
  eu policy is to fully embrace official languages of all member states and there 's absolutely no reason to change it . 
  * i would say `` yes , absolutely '' 5 years ago , but with the recent raise of nationalism i have more and more doubts . 
  [ s-300 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-300_%28missile%29 )  ** greece ** - s-300 pmu1 system acquired by greece after the cyprus missile crisis and operated by haf on the island of crete consisting of 2 batteries / 8 launchers / 39 missiles . 
  greece first fired an s-300 during the white eagle 2013 military exercise , which was the first time it was used since it was bought 14 years earlier . 
   proud and/or ashamed , depending on your point of view :   1 . 
  ryannair . 
  one of most successful new airlines in the world and one of most successful bands in the world ? 
  that 's definitely something you should n't be ashamed of , 
  well , that is a part of social culture ... or rather lack of thereof . 
   ashamed : * lack of respect to public property - damaging bus stops , signs , painting walls , etc. 
  random relatively recent example - brand new , beautiful facilities in a zoo , 2 weeks later already half of the signs damaged and walls * signed * with permanent markers . 
  -2 stability 12 000 troops strong peasants revolt . 
  + lithuania , + belarus , + latvia , + parts of estonia and russia . 
  lithuania needs to grow first . 
  we waited for them last time , we can wait for them this time , 
  anything but russia ^ ^ or ^ ^ belarus . 
  italian coast guard is not armed ? 
   simlar slavic culture such thing does n't exist . 
  it 's not x century any more ( yes , 10th century ) . 
  polish culture is as similar for them as german is . 
  language is somewhat similar for ukrainians from western ukraine , some of them even do speak polish due to having polish roots , but not so much for russians . 
  the fact the we do n't use cyrillic alphabet ( unlike , say , bulgaria ) is a major problem for them . 
  and [ eu does not stand by indifferent ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/12/18/eu-threatens-italywithlegalactionovermigrants.html ) . 
  but even despite of these conditions - it 's still a great deal , as pretty much every other migrant can get to europe illegally and in the end get all the papers to stay legally ( eu grants asylum to ~ 50 % of illegal immigrants ), 
  in before - eu [ does regulate lobbyists ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/etudes/join/2003/329438/dg-4-afco_et%282003%29329438_en.pdf ) . 
   eurozone crisis countries italy , portugal and spain are among the five worst-performing countries , where lobbying practices and close relations between the public and financial sectors are deemed risky . 
  that 's some interesting correlation right there ... 
   nobody would want to stay in romania or poland they already do n't . 
  polish government is obligated to take immigrants just like every other eu country , but pretty much only russians and ukrainians seek asylum in poland - and that 's because it 's close , so it 's easy to visit their families back in the country of origin . 
  and then a happy life in the eu for eu taxpayers money . 
  sounds like the best deal of their life . 
  i prefer them alive in their country instead of feeding traffickers and potentially opening doors for terrorists / criminals / ppl with no slightest respect to european values . 
  here is a post about that , from comments you can judge answers to your questions : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32guwe/stop_nazi_islam_isme_election_poster_denmark/, 
  sorry , but that 's not relevant . 
  romania and bulgaria are not in schengen , which is a subject of our discussion . 
  that 's aside from the point that romanians and bulgarians are not gypsies which you seem to be aware of , but somehow still point them in the statistics . 
   and burning non-believers and gays alive is better ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but that 's something specific to catholicism . 
  not christianity as such . 
   then why had the number of gypsies in germany increased so much after schengen ? 
  is that a personal perception or you have some data to show us that proves migration instead of natural growth ? 
   schengen abolished the border-controls assumes that gypsies care about border-controls and legally cross the border . 
  gypsies had schengen zone before anyone in germany even thought about it !, 
   very weird ... who commissioned the statue ? 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ronald_reagan_park,_gda%c5%84sk ) , it 's apparently an initiative of society ` dignity ' that noone ever heard about ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.zdiz.gda.pl/zdizgdansk/chapter_76353.asp ), 
  it 's actually the opposite . 
  first of all in real combat situation it 's borderline impossible to hit it and it is reinforced against small caliber bullets . 
  and secondly - in traditional helicopters tail rotor along with whole tail boom are one of most vulnerable points . 
  kamov avoids that significantly increasing survivability of it 's helicopters . 
  wikipedia has an article touching on a general subject of [ coaxial rotors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coaxial_rotors ) , not exactly specific to ka-50 / 52 as these are military helicopters , but give you some rough information about safety , reliability and advantages/disadvantages of this type of helicopter rotors .

  ukrainian president leonid kuchma said :  in this place where polish victims rest , on behalf of all ukrainians who want peace and justice , i wish to express my deep sympathy to all the wronged poles , all those who suffered as a result of this disaster . 
  we issue a strong condemnation of the violence committed against the polish civilian population . 
  in more recent days [ \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0301\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041f\u0430\u0301\u0432\u043b\u0456\u0432 ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%bb%d1%96%d0%b2_%d0%92%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80_%d0%92%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87 ) send a public [ apology letter ] ( http://zaxid.net/news/shownews.do?probachte_meni_brattyapolyaki&amp;objectid=1316299 ) to poles which echoed through [ polish media ] ( http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/historia/artykuly/465770,ukrainski-intelektualista-wolodymyr-pawliw-polacy-wybaczcie-mi-wolyn.html ) - mind you : he is in no way linked to the government . 
  ... which means less resources , time and money is wasted . 
  and it also means that cooperation of esa , which works in multi-year perspective , with nasa , which can have it 's budget for programmes altered on annual basis , is very problematic for esa and really good for nasa . 
  they paid attention to other countries joining euro and took appropriate measures to counter negative effects before anything wrong happened . 
  someone might get an impression from your post that it happened because lithuania is small - no , it happened because they played it smart . 
  esa was suppose to co-design and co-build [ europa jupiter system mission -- laplace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_jupiter_system_mission_%e2%80%93_laplace ) back when the project begun . 
  but nasa kept on having financial troubles so eventually esa said `` fuck it '' and currently goes full steam ahead with it 's own jupiter mission - [ juice ] ( http://sci.esa.int/juice/ ) . 
  hopefully if esa decides to join this project - it wo n't compromising any of the existing esa projects . 
   esa has really been our best partner , they 've been fabulous working with us . 
  we 've had ups and downs in the past and nearly all of these `` downs '' were on nasa side , so ... call me sceptic . 
  +1 stability, 
   usually the children attend state schools too and go to madrassas or other religious schools after that , or on the weekends . 
  so they are n't even violating any laws . 
  that makes sense . 
  well ... 
  i must say it looks like a tough nut to crack . 
  price-fixing cartels subscribed to / r/europeanfederalists . 
  hehehehehe, 
   if you are a salafi muslim or an islamist , that means you do n't believe in british values because they go against your ideologies and set of beliefs . 
  the problem is anyone can set up one of these schools and ** there are no regulations for it ** and they can then go on to brainwash children how did that happen ? 
  how it 's even possible to setup a school without any national institution overseeing what 's being taught in it ? 
  superintendents , nothing like that ? 
  i think i 'll never comprehend british logic ...

  most of the time eu in this or other form was there . 
  1945 - 1959 = 14 years . 
  1959 - 2015 = 56 years . 
  i know the history of eu and noone here talks about 50s but you two guys . 
  i think that talking about eu in context of european peace is more than justified , and apparently [ nobel committee agrees ] ( http://www.eeas.europa.eu/nobel-peace-prize/index_en.htm ) .

  hopefully there wo n't be any incidents or fights ... in general comments in polish media are between the two : '' * it 's a provocation , do n't get involved * '' and '' * it 's outrageous , who let them in ?! * '' .
