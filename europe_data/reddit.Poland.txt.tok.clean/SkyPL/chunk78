  fun fact : day before they will be in brze\u015b\u0107 , city where in 1939 there was a [ soviet-nazi victory parade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ego-necevi ) celebrating joined invasion on poland . 
   i would n't mind putting ours into a joint eu programme to minimise costs but i 'd also rather we did n't have our eggs in one basket . 
  i would n't mind either , but for that to happen - uk would need to stay in the eu , and currently uk stands right next to the open doors making up it 's mind . 
  we are talking about fifties ? 
  i thought we 're talking about why peace was , and in fact still is maintained * . 
  and ... at no point i mentioned commercial agreements or commercial ties , i do n't know what you are on about . 
  ^ ( * in before someone mentions ukraine - it 's not an open war . ), 
  yep . 
  events in ukraine and lack of will from uk and us to defend ukraine means that now it 'll be impossible to make any coutry give up it 's nuclear weapons or facilities if they are on the way to develop nuclear weapons . 
  russia basically killed any international negotiations on nuclear arms . 
  annexation of crimea and war in eastern ukraine have far worse consequences than most of the people imagine . 
  ... and european union with spirit of cooperation it brought ... and a living memory of horrific events of ww2 ... and several other quite complicated socio-economic factors . 
  putting it all on nukes and us troops is rather ... short-sighted . 
  is n't it more like a buzzfeed ? 
  it 's sputnik news . 
  do n't get excited . 
  using different traditional methods you can store many different vegetables for months and it was popular in medieval poland . 
  cold winters that were n't so prevalent in western and southern europe made it only easier . 
  meat was quite abundant back in xiv century . 
  poland back then was basically forests full of animals . 
  it was n't until xvii century that availability of large mammals become problematic . 
  and smoking allows you to store meat for a whole season . 
  risks invoked in hunting were a bigger problem than finding animals , in xiv century poland bears were still quite numerous and extremely dangerous , but other animals and accidents could also be deadly . 
  that said though - people also had domesticated animals , so hunting was n't the only way to obtain meat or alternative meals to wheat-based ( cows give milk , chickens give eggs - you know the game ) . 
  yes , it is . 
  means that people got wide access to meat and vegetables instead of wheat that was much more prevalent in western and southern europe . 
   poland at the time mostly forest , with significant distances between settlements . 
  casmir introduced internal quarantines ( as well as those at the borders ) , so that travelers ( especially caravans ) had to wait some distance outside cities for a period before entering . 
  he also conducted significant building works , with some exaggeration , poles say that casmir found a poland built of wood and left a poland built of brick . 
  from the link above , and this `` quote '' about building , poland was clearly rich , also a plus factor . 
   why is this undemocratic ? 
  from [ here ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/democracy ) :  democracy . 
  government by the people ; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system . 
  proposed idea is a government by the limited group of people . 
  it also does n't have a free electoral system . 
  so , no , it 's not a democracy any more . 
   what the government must do is improving the education. , because that is a right as well . 
  yes . 
  that 's the key . 
  [ here is eu report on the matter ] ( http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/thematic_reports/139en.pdf ) . 
  on page 21 ( 19 ) you can find quite an interesting map titled '' * provision of a separate , compulsory subject focused on elements of citizenship education , according to national curricula * '' . 
  so eu countries are already doing something to educate people on the subject . 
  sadly often these lessons are rater ... very poor quality , at least in poland - for kids it 's more like a long break than an actual lesson where they have to focus and a subject that they might fail because they have no clue how national government works . 
  so yes - there 's a lot of space to improve and actually teach people what democracy is , why it 's important , how government works , who can do what , how eu functions , what rights do people have in both : context of human rights and constitution , and so on , and so on . 
  polish young men - the worst social group . 
  as if [ having more man than women ] ( http://s3.egospodarka.pl/grafika2/demografia/rozwoj-demograficzny-polski-2012-112334-640x640.jpg ) would n't be bad enough - foreigners want to take our women ... , 
  to expand : this was a problem in '90s when unemployment due to fall of [ pgr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_agricultural_farm ) combined with emigration to cities were really making life of people in these villages miserable . 
  it normalized around year 2000 . 
  raising wealth of the society , easier access to cars , better infrastructure and raising prices of flats in a cities caused many people to move out to nearby villages . 
  the biggest winners obviously were villages closest to the large cities which right now look beautiful and have really healthy population . 
  currently there 's a slow , but constant [ trend ] ( http://stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/l_podst_inf_o_rozwoju_dem_pl_do_2013.pdf ) in poland of people moving out from cities into rural areas . 
  random interesting fact : according to wikipedia [ poland has 447 abandoned villages ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kategoria:opuszczone_wsie_w_polsce ) , but keep in mind that most of them were abandoned between viii century and the end of ww2 . 
  i know , but not all of the ukrainians having polish roots qualify for a pole card . 
  but ... germany [ did have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reunification ) it 's borders , name and stuff changed ... ( [ so did italy for that matter ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_osimo ) ) . 
  this map is a mess ... but well , nevermind me . 
  in polish it has two meanings . 
  sexual relationships between adult man and adolescent 2 . 
  contemptuously : homosexual do n't be surprised - there are many cases where polish language does n't fully retain original meaning of the adopted foreign word . 
   oh , and constitution calls marriage `` an union of men and woman '' interesting fact : one of the common arguments of lg marriage opponents is that polish word '' * ma\u0142\u017ce\u0144stwo * '' ( marriage ) means union of male and female , which has a different source than english '' * marriage * '' , therefore '' * ma\u0142\u017ce\u0144stwo * '' can not exist between people of the same sex . 
  you 've been out since the end of xx century ? 
  you really think it matters ? 
  * it 's a first time us tanks fired a live rounds in lithuania * speeches & interviews begin at [ 4:23 ] ( https://youtu.be/wqdkdx8l0zg?t=263 ) * tank commander talks at [ 8:50 ] ( https://youtu.be/wqdkdx8l0zg?t=531 ), 
   that small square on the left shows what countries have been to space after their borders/name/stuff changed then a small map is wrong . 
  to give you some random examples : [ alexander gerst ( de ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_gerst ) just returned from space and [ samantha cristoforetti ( it ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samantha_cristoforetti ) is currently on iss . 
  this small map seems to deny existance of esa or any trips european astronauts made to space in cooperation with usa . 
   you 're implying it 's all german money . 
  it 's european money , from most countries . 
  i really wish more people would realize that . 
  but making it a germany-greece bipolar * affair * is exactly what greek goverment wants - it not only directs an anger of people abroad but also makes greeks look like some poor victims of * deutche imperialism * ... 
  hahahaha , i like how you popped with that idea and then this is published : [ greece demands that iran pay 800 billion euros in reparations from the greco-persian wars ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/324ltx/greece_demands_that_iran_pay_800_billion_euros_in/ ) . 
  it 's still essentially the same problem with vast majority of arguments raised against it being the same . 
  i could just copy-paste my [ previous answer ] ( https://ua.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/321nkr/should_germany_pay_greece_war_reperations/cq71p99 ) with slight changes to the first sentence and it would be just as adequate . 
  so would be few other answers from that topic . 
  no offense meant , but it looks you are trying to change your question for as long as it takes to make people say '' * yes , germany should give greece money * '' . 
   does your country use the euro ? 
  no , but hopefully eventually will . 
   what do you think of the euro ? 
  one of better projects in the eu , even though currently overshadowed by the greek mess . 
  on a low level it helps simplifying everyday life , lowering transaction costs , and unifying the eu for higher competitiveness on a markets ( read : in a long term it lowers prices and gives easier access to goods ) , on a higher level it helps companies with migrating risks , trading within eurozone , gives easier access to foreign markets ( for getting employees , investors , competing in contracts ) , and again : significantly lowers expenses when trading with other eurozone countries , on more national level - it helps with keeping inflation in check , decreasing interest rates , lowers the risk of currency speculations , increases independence guarantees ( which is one of the more important reasons for why latvia joined euro ) , helps with further integration of the eu . 
   how would you like to improve the euro ? 
  increase budget regulations for eurozone member states  do you think the euro will still be around 20 years ? 
  of course it will . 
  muslim ukrainians must be completely screwed ...  _ , 
  ^ jealous romania of being late to space . 
  also : most of them still speak polish to some degree . 
  and in before : yes , they are not fluent and vast majority of them can not write in polish . 
  but they do understand polish quite well and can speak polish in a communicative level . 
  it would work like d-type visa . 
  or we could issue d-type visas automatically , free of charge . 
  pretending that poland ca n't do anything on it 's own is the easiest excuse our politicians use almost all the time while in fact it 's far from truth . 
   i can not believe that he really thinks he 's convincing anyone . 
  but he actually is convincing almost everyone - almost everyone in russia and almost everyone with links to far left and right european parties ( which by some miracle both tend to support russia almost universally across the eu ) . 
  if polish government wants it so badly - it should make an example for others and be the first one to grant ukrainians visa-free travel . 
  cause what i see them doing now is a lot of talking but very little action . 
  no , they should not . 
  why ? 
  because it 's russia-style undermining of an existing and established order in europe . 
  greece signed [ charter of paris for a new europe ] ( http://www.osce.org/mc/39516?download=true ) which means that it obligated itself to respect the [ treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ) terminating their rights to any claims on anything related to the third reich . 
  it 's a done deal . 
  that ship has sailed .
