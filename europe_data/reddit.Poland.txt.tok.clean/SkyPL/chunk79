  trying to get it back is like opening a whole cans of worms and undermining years of peace we 've had . 
  it 's directly playing against greece 's european partners for an advantage of russia trying to destabilize and deassemble european order . 
  it 's totally unacceptable . 
  sorry guys , too late for top gear . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but it seems to be the same one . 
  old news recycled . 
  so that makes a total of ... ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ 4 people . 
  sounds like slightly sensational headline . 
   kov\u00e1cs was reported on by hungary 's civil intelligence , as it came to their attention that the politician was regularly meeting russian diplomats and visiting moscow every month . 
  his name also came up during an investigation concerning a still-active former kgb agent . 
  not only a traitor , but also a total idiot . 
   i 've heard cops there cheat to look good in stats . 
  you mean - totally unlike in the us , do n't you ? 
  most of the people in western poland were actually [ resettled by soviets from far eastern poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_population_transfers_%281944%e2%80%9346%29 ) . 
  [ relevant map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/map_of_poland_%281945%29.png ) - people were moved from pink areas to yellow . 
  this map can lead to some false interpretations . 
  what you see got very little to deal with populations living under german rule after [ partition of poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_partition_of_poland ) , cause most of them actually lived under russian empire , just like people in the blue regions did . 
   with the current participation rate , it 's hardly democratic . 
  same can be said about parliaments in most of eu countries . 
  not to mention that by pushing this logic just a tiny bit further : north korea is the most democratic country in a world with [ 99.97 % turnout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_north_korea#latest_election ) . 
  we already have a topic about that : [ esa just gave the green light for an asteroid deflection mission launching in 2019 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/316dca/esa_just_gave_the_green_light_for_an_asteroid/ ), 
  [ ** party time !, 
  ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwbizawuidw ), 
  we already have a post about it : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31qrfj/russian_nuclear_submarine_on_fire/, 
  per http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-nuclear-submarine-catches-fire-in--zvyozdochka-shipyard-10160022.html, 
  it 's an interesting design and potentially a very good tank , but let 's not get fooled - it 's not any special magical futuristic tank , it 's merely russia catching up to modern western tanks . 
  for simplification think of it a mix between leopard 2 and [ leclerc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amx_leclerc ) . 
   the russian military intends to replace 70 percent of its tank corps with the new tracked vehicle it 's suppose to happen before 2020 . 
  t-90 was suppose to replace t-72 in the same way and how it 's obsolete even before it became a basic tank for majority of russian armored forces . 
   but everyone that lives and works and calls scotland home deserves their say in their future just like everyone else . 
  i could disagree with that . 
  many of these people will be out from scotland in 5-10-20 years or so , depending on a personal circumstances . 
  imho votes like that should be at a very least limited to british citizens living is scotland . 
  god damn it !, 
  also : [ caves ] ( http://www.slovakia.com/caves/ ) . 
  slovakia is full of them ( 2,400 !!! ), 
  and some are quite amazing . 
   ( i hope we 'll have more than 2 % of gdp soon ) it will be over 2 % next year . 
  and * de facto * it 's over 2 % already if you include payments for f-16 ( mod does n't pay for them , so they are not in a statistic ) . 
   `` why on the earth do you want to insist to build your own airport in a region that has absolutely no capacity to generate any meaningful demand for air transportation , this i can not comprehend , '' he said . 
  [ jacek krawczyk , the former chairman of the board of directors of lot polish national airlines ] that sums it up . 
  if i can add anything : people from that region got an access to 3 airports : modlin , warsaw and gdansk , two of which have by far better connections than szymany could ever possibly get . 
  it will probably end up being similar flop to the radom airport . 
    russian schoolchildren invited to spend holidays in north korean camps    a high-ranking north korean diplomat in far eastern russia has proposed that local schoolchildren spend their holidays in north korean youth camps in a bid to further strengthen relations between the countries . 
    and so is this random fun fact : in a years of deep communism in polish people 's republic there was a regular exchange of pupils with north korea for 2-3 weeks in summer . 
  failed probe landing with orbiter monitoring it would still be very useful for the mission . 
  launch and sending orbiter on a correct trajectory is by far more crucial part of the mission than landing itself . 
  that 's speculation that probably would never happen - historians argue that generalplan ost would never be executed , even if germans would win ww2 . 
  and there were allies , so even if russia would loose - us with other western allies would still win the war , and that would be by far better solution than being held by russians till the end of 80s what costed life and health of millions poles . 
  but anyway - i never said they would be preferable . 
  preferable solution would be to regain independence from hands of western allies . 
  [ edit ] downvote me to hell if you want , but that 's a brutal truth - soviets freeing poland from nazi occupation was one of the biggest disasters in a history of poland . 
  but if probe fails - mission still goes on . 
  if launch fails - it 's over . 
   for sure germany was more bloody and cruel then russians they actually were n't . 
  see comments above . 
  russians were by far more cruel , but also more bloody , only not as open about it as germans were . 
  but that 's a stupid statement you are trying to make anyway - both were horrible , both wanted to destroy polish culture , both eventually failed . 
  so does the quality . 
  i 'm quite worried for this project . 
  proton lately does n't have an excellent track record and sending spacecraft to mars is a whole different game ... 
  we call it a statue of aragorn . 
  there was even an idea to re-use it [ for border crossings ] ( http://e.asset.soup.io/asset/1322/9278_3ac8.jpeg ) , 
  surely a british tourists though . 
  so ... this law did not pass yet , did it ? 
  yep . 
  it will also be the first ever mission to the binary asteroid, 
  nope . 
  it 's totally esa-alike sentence . 
  these are the guys that flew a probe through the tail of halley comet ( it got blinded and damaged , but it survived !, 
  ) , wanted to harpoon the 67p comet , build laser communication system for satellites ( edrs ) , wanted to build a rocket pushed by two rocket-powered airbuses ( reusable fly-back boosters for ariane v ) , went through numerous aerobreaking maneuvers on an orbit of ... venus and had tons of other totally unconventional and unexpected ideas . 
  historically poland and germany had a period without any war between 1520 and 1772 , or if you are looking any any more serious war that involved sizeable hre forces - that would be xiv century , making it over 400 years of peace . 
  all of it with flourishing trade and friendly relations between people . 
  they fucked up later on , but i think there is no obstacle in breaking that record  . 
  we tried , but it ended up being * [ bimber ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moonshine ) * . 
  do n't remember anything else from that night . 
   an even bigger of a dick move was taking vilnius in 1920 , because pi\u0142sudzki felt like it . 
  you can read about it , even on the wiki if you 're interested . 
  oh yes . 
  if i 'd be making a list of the worst things ii rp done - that would be on a top . 
  that was really backstabbing in one of the worst ways , especially considering close relations between lithuania and poland for centuries . 
  i have no idea ... 
  i hope someone else can give you a better answer , cause some of the things on that list leave me puzzled . 
  i say : it 's all within statistical error  hehe, 
  more like piskorski or [ janusz korwin mikke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janusz_korwin-mikke ) . 
  kaczy\u0144ski-alike people are more anti-russian than average poles , some of them believe that polish government in cooperation with russians and putin murdered a brother of kaczy\u0144ski in the [ airplane crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) . 
  yea ... about them ... these guys tend to be the same that demolish warsaw each independence day and [ pose to the photos like this ] ( http://g4.gazetaprawna.pl/p/_wspolne/pliki/1553000/1553771-.jpg ) , on a background of burning rainbow that we used to celebrate our presidency in the eu and somehow they made it a symbol of homosexuals that should be burned ... so ... you have my apologies for them . 
  i 'm quite sure buffett is more concerned with a fate of euro than greece . 
  someone called it * dumping ballast policy * . 
  that said though - overall the interview was quite decent and i can hardly see things i might disagree with in what he said , even if i disagree that greece leaving euro would be a good thing for anyone but speculants on a financial markets . 
  yea , your government with orban sucking up to russians ( cause that 's how it 's often viewed in poland ) really does n't do you any favours ... but let 's say it 's a small , temporary aberration in a centuries long polish-hungarian friendship  i assure you that everyone in poland knows '' * polak , w\u0119gier , dwa bratanki , i do szabli , i do szklanki * '' , 
  we had this topic discussed several times , [ last time it was here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zf9l0/100_czech_intellectuals_including_fifteen_charta/cpijz1f ) ( might be worth a read for a different points of view on the matter ) . 
  random statistic to make our czech friends feel better - you are the nation poles like most in the entire world !, 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2014/k_020_14.pdf ) ), 
  [ this is all random speculation - you have been warned ] for any notable effect they 'd have to detonate bomb under ground for an earthquake effect and weakening the rocks in area large enough to trigger volcanic explosion ( assuming it 's not about to explode in next few years ... in which case russians could just sit and wait ) . 
  this is very , very difficult to achieve with icbm ( read : noone ever managed to accomplish that ) , and russians got no experience in this sorts of devices , it 'd be difficult even for us with it 's budget . 
  it 'd also need to be a precision-guided bomb , making it even more unlikely to happen - as far as predicting best impact point is doable with publicly available data , guiding an icbm capable of digging under ground with high precision is n't really feasible . 
  this leaves one option : strategic bomber dropping specially designed seismic bomb with nuclear warhead . 
  as far as theoretically it is doable - [ location of the yellowstone park ] ( http://www.yellowstonegate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/where-is-yellowstone-global.gif ) makes such attack very unlikely to succeed . 
  the idea with san andreas fault while much more feasible would n't be nowhere near the devastation level inflicted by supervolcano .
