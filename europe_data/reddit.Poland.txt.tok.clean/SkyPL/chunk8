  this is also an argument for why allowing pan-european licensing deals will only ** increase ** cultural diversity , not decrease it . 
  people wanting to stay competitive will be forced to look for inspirations in local folklore and local culture instead of hollywood like they do now !, 
  wow ... poland is excellent . 
  i 'm surprised . 
  tumblr and reddit are ** far *** - left sjw hugbox * es ?!, 
   conspiracy-minded people are the most open to considering the reality , which is that international jewry , in fact , runs our societies rotfl :d hilarious . 
  they never thought that there 's something suspicious in the fact that only conspiracy-minded people share their point of view ? 
  the people that they refer to as a '' * retards * '' ? 
   all europeans hate gypsies , and most of them hate moslems too . 
  anti-jew attitudes are very widespread in europe as well . 
  i do n't hate * moslems * , and do n't have anything against gypsies or jews , but you know who i really hate ? 
  fucking nationalists !, 
   however , many europeans are n't aware of the fact that jews are responsible for multiculturalism , open borders , the eu , cultural marxism , and other policies that are leading to the total destruction of europe . 
  it 's our job to wake them up to that fact . 
  jews stole my sandwich too !, 
  and open borders are definitely ruining europe !, 
  each time i go to the other eu country without showing my passport i totally feel like i ruined it a little bit more . 
  it makes perfect sense - just look at greece , the most popular holiday destination for the europeans , and how open borders totally ruined their country !, 
  makes perfect sense !, 
   go on european-dominated subreddits and drop subtle redpills . 
  do n't use `` gas the kikes , race war now '' - type rhetoric , obviously . 
  obviously not now . 
  but use it once you form a government in one of the countries ... then you can show who you really are !, 
   now , we need to focus on redpilling reddit -- then , soon enough , every other major website . 
  neonazis and their secret plan to become new illuminati . 
  -- jesus , nationalists are fucking idiots . 
  nothing changed . 
  upvote this post , let more people be aware of this conspiracy plan of theirs . 
   except it 's a load of crap . 
  i agree . 
  but the easiest answers are always most tempting , and it 's always easier to blame the `` outsiders '' - in case of eu countries it 's brussels and the eu itself - than put the fault on your own people - your own country government that got competences to fight with all of these issues . 
   i wish less people fell for this trap . 
  russian narration of corrupt , broken west is winning , and people refuse to see it . 
  [ we have a thread with a talk of prof. timothy snyder ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xorha/timothy_snyder_since_2013_putins_main_foreign/ ) on the same topic expressing similar opinions to yours . 
  worth listening . 
  eurozone would need to have solid , stable growth , while countries in question would need to stagnate . 
  that 'd be the biggest incentive . 
  money works better than anything else and gives you very strong , objective advantage . 
  the fact that currently it 's the opposite ( [ gdp growth for the entire eu ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp-annual-growth-rate ) , [ and eurozone alone ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/gdp-growth-annual ) ) along with greek crisis make it very difficult to convince people or politicians . 
  right now by all means it looks like staying out of the eurozone is the best thing to do . 
  obviously situation is much more complex in reality , and simplifying it to gdp alone is a little bit of an abuse , but still - it creates a very bad first impression for any country even attempting to reconsider the situation . 
  you forget that since 1946 all of the population in the very western part of the country is in fact from far eastern parts of the 1914s poland . 
  so it is more complicated than using imperial germany borders as some excuse . 
  even more so if you 'll pay attention to the fact that big cities on the east vote exactly as whole west part of the country . 
  [ here is the map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/map_of_poland_%281945%29.png ) - people were forced to move from orange lands to yellow lands .

  the heck that fox got ? 
  that 's less than people living in baghdad . 
  perhaps they did n't want list to be filled with us and western european cities ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xwtlv/city_quality_of_livingranking_2015/ btw : nice , interactive map . 
  with some weird colors . 
  yes . 
  two polish cities in top 100 . 
  capital city of warsaw and wroc\u0142aw . 
  i 've been in both for a while , and i 'm not really surprised , they 're great places to live in , only for a very different reasons . 
  what is surprising though is that baghdad has a higher quality of life than every other polish city . 
  not to mention all of these other weird cities like [ nouakchott ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:nouakchott_air_01.jpg ) ( rank 221 ) . 
   a lot more people will come to europe , numbers will keep rising . 
  as long as they do it legally and fulfil the requirements - i do n't mind . 
  otherwise the fact that more people want to get here should n't be used as an excuse to taking everyone with enough cash to buy a ticket on some used wreck that 's used to push nearly thousand people across the sea . 
  and that 's pretty much what politicians been doing . 
  money we spent now on ensuring social support for illegal immigrants after europe adopts them with open arms would be much better spent on international aid and helping their home countries stand on their feet . 
   they provide help to both italy and greece , if that 's a help in returning people back to the african shore - i 'm all for it . 
  cause everything else than that will only cause more illegal immigrants and more * lives saved * from year to year . 
  there goes the joke !, 
  i 'm glad to hear that something is being done about russian propaganda machine . 
  yes , it 's a tiny step with enormous mountain ahead , but it 's always something . 
  so , what will happen to them ? 
  let me guess : they will not be sent back to africa . 
  he is being sarcastic . 
  poland would be delighted . 
  sadly that wo n't happen : / ( or happily - from ukrainian perspective  ), 
  yea . 
  ukraine also have been providing multiple components to various space programmes - including a construction of an upper stage for arianespace vega small launch vehicle . 
  poland is a joke comparing to ukraine when it comes to space flight technologies .

  increases your cancer risk by 25 % . 
  look at the map . 
  there 's clearly no link between gdp and cancer . 
  ok , in case you do n't recall which countries are rich and which are not - here is [ gdp per capita ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/bnpperhoofd2013.png ), 
  is that because you have no money for smoking ? 
   someone might honsetly believe that women are inferior to men but it wo n't excuse him if he will express such views in public . 
  false parallel . 
  i 'm not sure average russian citizen can see that difference . 
   how would / r/europe feel about the uk losing its nuclear deterrent ? 
  bad idea . 
  since the budapest memorandum came out to be worthless - disarming any of the nato countries from nuclear weapons is a very , very bad idea . 
  breaking the budapest memorandum means that now none of the countries developing nuclear weapons - like iran or north korea - will fall for any guarantees west can make in an exchange for disarmament . 
  and this means that it 's in an interest of every country in the world to keep it 's weapons . 
  and then there 's russia . 
  country that respects only other nuclear powers . 
  having nuclear weapons yourself , uk and the eu got stronger position in any possible negotiations with russians . 
  uk having nuclear weapons is in the best interest of their citizens safety as well as the safety of the whole western world . 
  highest voted comment :   `` the european parliament is one of the biggest in the world . 
  it represents around half a billion people ''  no it does n't . 
   it represents itself and the interests of the founding fathers ( mostly multi-millionaires and banks - look it up ) . 
  for it to represent us , it needs to have a mandate to do so . 
  that mandate has never been given . 
  sounds like neither this guy nor anyone voting for him ever been in the european parliament elections , and now got complains about that ... -- also :  one of the greatest failings of the eu is that it tried to crush national identities .
