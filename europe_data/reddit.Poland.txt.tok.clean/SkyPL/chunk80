  if they would manage to trigger tsunami - which is very , very unlikely for numerous reasons geologists can give you - it 'd be another perl harbor - enough to enrage us and push them into war , but not enough to do damage required to kill or at least temporally suspend us war machine . 
  we 'd end up with a real cold war ii and another berlin wall , only this time thousands kilometres long between the eu and russia & belarus , possibly also us intervention in ukraine . 
  it does however have an advantage in that it theoretically could be performed in secrecy with ru denying any involvement and playing stupid like they did with crimea . 
   march 31 , 2015 i hope i correctly assumed it 's not a joke article . 
   us 's ultimate goal was to `` destroy russia '' . 
  russians still thing that world revolves around them , and that there 's some bi-polar split where russia is the only objective and an opponent to the us ? 
  oh , these good old cold war dreams ... 
  i looked up his post history . 
  he is n't / r/european user , got quite long history of posts in / r/europe though . 
  explain ? 
  cause google translate does n't work on this site . 
   it 's not necessarily an abuse noone said that it must be an abuse . 
  as i said - without any charges you can be held for only 48 hours , that 's better than in many ( most ? ), 
  european countries . 
  however if charges are pressed and you get into pre-trial arrest ( which requires approval from court ) - you can be held indefinitely , which is much worse than in many ( most ? ), 
  european countries . 
  and it was abused in some ( not all ) cases , as proven by european court of human rights , it 's not a discussable matter , it 's a fact . 
   no way this is real yes , it is . 
  [ quotas actually ended yesterday , 31 march ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milk_quota ) . 
   the french farmers will be rioting like crazy it 's a british idea , not french . 
  and so it happened . 
  next months might be a little bit of a shock therapy for some , but overall it 's a good news . 
  in poland you can be detained for only up to 48 hours withouth any charges . 
  prosecutor can ask court for temporary arrest ( remand ) after pressing charges and that can last until court case is over . 
  remand was notoriously abused in poland , with several people winning cases in echr and thousands of people detained for no good reason . 
  record of longest detention was 12 years and 6 months . 
  now situation improved , but it 's still quite common abuse . 
  all true , all true . 
  leopard 2 painted in the eu flag ? 
  someone should make that happen . 
  wow ... it 's really well made . 
  really , really well made . 
  looks like a relatively high budget production . 
  well done . 
  ( that 's totally ignoring bs they say ... or the fact that this video looks like preparing ground for full-on invasion on ukraine and future war with the eu and nato ), 
  finally !, 
  8 years since that guy left government . 
  hopefully more will follow , including mr. ziobro . 
   all of the `` removal '' rules only really apply to submissions if so , then it should be clearly specified in the rules . 
  you are missing `` d '' in a title . 
  and that also includes mr. cameron who is one of the most active ttip supporters , if not to say : the most active ttip supporter of all eu council members . 
  but yea , let 's blame eu for that too , cause eu is always guilty and always * forcing it 's laws on poor uk * . 
  love more than any other eu country ? 
  perhaps . 
  trying to emulate political system ? 
  hell no . 
  again : i do n't need to suggest anything , statistics are out there for everyone to see . 
  this year alone there 's been [ 3 shootings in us schools ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_shootings_in_the_united_states ) . 
  and it 's barely spring !, 
  that 's as many as there 's been in xxi century germany . 
  it 's not unfounded fearmongering . 
  it 's raw data . 
   the following 6 pages are in this category vs  the following 50 pages are in this category , out of 50 total &  this category has the following 3 subcategories also note the dates on these shootings in germany . 
  only 3 happened in xxi century , one article in that category is about shooting from 1913 ( !!! ) . 
  this year alone there 's been [ 3 shootings in us schools ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_shootings_in_the_united_states ) . 
  and it 's barely spring !, 
  if you want to learn about some weird stuff : there 's a [ desert in poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c5%82%c4%99d%c3%b3w_desert ) that nazis used to train afrika korps ... there 's europe there for you - not only beautiful nature , but also plenty of totally unexpected places with historical background . 
   you have read to much reddit if you think that is how the u.s is . 
  that 's actually based on impressions from my own visit and a visits of my friends in the us ( if you want an example : the things with people shouting in hospitals is from the latest visit of my friend when he got serious food poisoning and went through two hospitals , the same scene in both - random people shouting one over another that they 're going to sue the hospital for whatever they did n't like today ( one guy had a cold soup ) ) . 
   it 's so ... amazing , that one country has deserts and mountains , and canyons , and ... you know that all of this is in the eu too ? 
  [ deserts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:deserts_of_europe ) . 
  [ mountains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:mountains_of_europe ) , [ canyons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:canyons_and_gorges_of_europe ) , and [ more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:landforms_of_europe ) ... , 
  that should solve war in ukraine . 
  / s also : amusing assumption that rich european countries wo n't build dams to protect their population . 
  somehow i doubt netherlands would just let themselves be flooded . 
  i already had a chance to work in us , but chose not to . 
  sorry , but i prefer european system where people do n't constantly shout at doctors in hospitals that they 're going to sue them , governments do n't want to look into your pants , nationalism is n't celebrated in all of the media and on the streets , people are n't career and celebrity-obsessed , every issue is n't viewed through the prism of politics and every issue does n't have to become polarized by a twin-party system , random idiots do n't have weapons , so you do n't have to be worried some idiot is going to run in a killing spree through your kids ' school ... 
  i could go on , but i think you get the point , 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but was n't diaspora * suppose to be this sort of thing ? 
  it never got even half as popular as google + . 
  let 's find a compromise : lots and lots of tanks + white humanitarian convoys = [ white tanks convoy ] ( http://media.moddb.com/images/groups/1/3/2074/338250wp4.jpg ), 
  european union :  ** acts of terrorism **  intentional acts that , given their nature or context , may seriously damage a country or an international organisation where committed with the aim of seriously intimidating a population , or unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act , or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political , constitutional , economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation :  ** terrorism **  in the absence of a generally accepted definition under international law , `` terrorism '' can be defined as the intentional and systematic use of actions designed to provoke terror in the public as a means to certain ends . 
  terrorism can be the act of an individual or a group of individuals acting in their individual capacity or with the support of a state . 
  it may also be the act of a state , whether against the population ( human rights violations such as forced labour , deportation , genocide , etc. 
  ) , or in the context of an international armed conflict against the civil population of the enemy state . 
  so : no , he was n't a terrorist . 
  it was a typical [ suicide by pilot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_by_pilot ) , not the first time it happened , nor the last one , but probably the first time some of media try to incorrectly label pilot as a `` terrorist '' after it came out that the act got no goal that characterises terrorist acts . 
  suicide by pilots can happen without having any links to terrorist acts , just like [ suicide by cops ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_by_cop ) can . 
  for those interested - it 's a [ holland-class offshore patrol vessel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holland-class_offshore_patrol_vessels ) . 
  one of the most beautiful military ships in the world . 
  good hint . 
  the same applies to every social media that gathers large amount of information ( instagram , google + , etc. 
  first i wrote a long comment about several misleading or bluntly false statements in first two paragraphs ... but then i realised that this whole article is written by someone with absolutely no idea about history , current world situation , what nato is and what russia does . 
  so i 'll save myself time and just say that : this article is a laughable kremlin propaganda . 
  northern outreaches of finland - more innovative than poland . 
  it 's lithuanian . 
  of course it does n't . 
  paratroopers acquired their russian-looking presidential award from local military shop . 
   maybe you get nostalgic when you live on an island or the fact that uk is not a part of schengen area ... 
  on another planet ? 
  technocracy with centrally planned economy . 
  you need experts making decisions , and with only 1000 people you must have central control to progress and grow in a steady , sustainable way that ensures long-term survival of a colony . 
  though talking about choosing an `` economic system '' in such a small group of people is somewhat misleading , it does n't really work in the same way it works in state-sized economies having millions of people working . 
  central planning on what to do next would be more of a necessity due to very limited amount of workers and resources than anything else . 
  to give a better sense of scale - 2.5 % of people means that every estonian used to know at least one person that was deported . 
  same here . 
  when i read the title :  did schengen ruin the romance of travel ? 
  i laughed out loud . 
  not a good thing to do at work : /, 
   most of these are humanitarian ( ... ) .
