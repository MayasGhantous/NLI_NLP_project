  please uk do not leave the eu . 
  meanwhile in uk : [ tories plan to withdraw uk from european convention on human rights ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/03/tories-plan-uk-withdrawal-european-convention-on-human-rights ) . 
   on a more serious note - brits that want uk to leave eu think that they loose more staying in than they gain . 
  most of the arguments circle around independence and power , not just trade and money as such . 
  ( that said though it 's difficult to give any reasonable summary cause i seen tons of different arguments raised , even conspiracy theories ( eg . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_world_order_%28conspiracy_theory%29 ) from [ here ] ( http://debatewise.org/debates/784-the-uk-should-leave-the-european-union/ ) ) ) . 
  for those interested - why this leo 2 does n't look like the usual leo 2 is because it 's leopard 2ng variant .

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2yxm00/why_are_white_people_expats_when_the_rest_of_us/ ) ( not because of stupid article , but because if anyone does n't know what 's the difference between `` expat '' and `` immigrant '' - comments there offer a nice explanation ), 
   the uk wo n't take any option that allows anything other than very strictly `` controlled '' movement . 
  as far as i 'm aware you also wo n't take any option that involves paying money to the eu and fully approving eu laws in a way norway does . 
  all of these mean that you have very little ground for negotiations and a very difficult position to get trade-related deals you want . 
  open europe is just one of many think tanks in europe , do n't overrate texts . 
  they can write whatever , it changes very little to the realpolitik . 
  and a realpolitik is that there 's absolutely no reason for brussels to change anything in a deal with norway , while norway simply can not `` join with the uk to take a new option '' on it 's own , eu makes separate negotiations with every partner . 
  not to mention that we do n't even know if norway will want `` uk option '' in a first place - they 're quire happy with the current option and uk might just as well negotiate far worse deal from norwegian perspective . 
  global financial centres index : * london : 784 * frankfurt : 692 international financial centres development index * london : 86.64 * frankfurt : 60.27, 
   once the uk leaves , norway could well join with the uk to take a new option . 
  you assume that brussels would agree to that which is extremely unlikely considering that it 's against every interest they have . 
  the deal brissels has with norway right now is ideal . 
  norway is forced to comply with eu laws while at the same time paying into eu budget ( [ yes , they do ] ( http://www.eu-norway.org/eu/financial-contribution/ ) ) , and having no input on anything in the eu . 
  it 's more likely that uk will be forced to choose norway option or quit all together than that norway will be allowed to pick a better , more influential option than they currently have . 
  brexit would be shock for brussels and they 'd be allergic to any renegotiations what so ever , while norway can not afford loosing anything what eu offers right now . 
  still though - in my opinion most likely scenario for uk is that it will find some half-decent middle ground , being forced to comply at a portion of eu laws while having no input at them what so ever . 
  they 'll also still contribute money to at least part of the eu programmes . 
  norway will stay unaffected by brexit . 
   they do n't realize either that norway and switzerland have to obey 90 % of the regulations set in brussels with 0 % input into how those regulations are written . 
  each time i tell that to my british friends they replay : `` but we will negotiate a better deal cause eu needs us more than we need eu !, 
  / r/france got quite a bit of front national supporters, 
  [ here is a nice list with pictures in a completely random order ] ( http://www.famousbirthdays.com/birthplace/poland.html ), 
  that makes him a son of stan lee ? 
  ryan air did n't have any airplane crash either , but at the same time i 'm sure they transported more passengers over greater distance than either of these trains in , say , last 5 years . 
   [ statistically speaking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aviation_safety#comparison_to_other_modes_of_travel ) airplanes are the safest method of travel per kilometer travelled , and the number of fatalities is going down each year , despite of growing number of airliners and people traveling by air . 
  your anecdotal evidence got little to deal with overall reality , just like my anecdotal evidence does . 
  but yes - trains are one of the safest methods of travel , no doubt about that !, 
  look up wikipedia . 
  there are dozens of plane crashes every year you never heard of . 
  accidents like this one , with high number of victims , get so much publicity because of just how rare they are . 
  and still that ` publicity ' is usually limited to the continent where accident happened . 
  there is a reason why airplane travel is considered the safest . 
  oh , i 'm very sorry that i 'm not * nationalistic enough * for you to break this border where you start name-calling me . 
  and no - it 's not pretending . 
  just my point of view is not matching your imaginary vision of who i am , so confusion and why you 're thinking there was a hypocrisy when there is n't one is understandable . 
  but i was suppose to let go , so i 'm out . 
  [ is that related ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/ ) ? 
   nothing about true victims and you declined to acknowledge that the people who were beaten up were victims too . 
  do i have to make a long list of what i acknowledge with each post ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  i acknowledge universal declaration of human rights . 
  i acknowledge european convention on human rights , i acknowledge french law . 
  i acknowledge british law . 
  i acknowledge that beating people is no solution to any problem . 
  i acknowledge that mentioned immigrants where victims in a published video . 
  now - happy ? 
   you said `` the only way for the immigrants to be victims is by trying to emigrate legally '' i never said that either . 
  stop twisting my words to fit your personal point of view of how supposedly evil and nationalistic i am . 
  if someone wants to read what i said - he is free to read it directly from my posts . 
  i 'm done playing games with you . 
   you said what they did was not shocking at all because these events were bound to happen due to long-term negligence of the government . 
   and that they were reacting in the only way they could which is true , because police failed to fulfill their duties . 
  i never said that what they did was right . 
   that the truck drivers were the only victims , all i said is that they were the true victims of these events , not `` the only victims '' . 
   strongly denying that the immigrants that were beaten were victims at all . 
  that never happened . 
  and if i were you i would look up what nationalism is before making statements like you are . 
  i see you are still butthurt for getting downvoted , but no reason to escalate it to a different threads . 
  if someone is interested - here is the discussion [liveleak.com - migrants beaten by truck drivers in calais ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zsjl9/liveleakcom_migrants_beaten_by_truck_drivers_in/ ), 
  fyi : i was pointing out a failure of government in preventing this situation to happen , and that 's got nothing to deal with nationalism - i do n't belong to any nation involved in the events in calais . 
  look beyond '' * oh my god , someone dared to say immigrants did something wrong * '' point of view and see what i actually said about who is there really to blame . 
  confused / r/europe with / r/european /, 
  well , they made a show in a city square . 
  it 's not really `` driving through '' . 
  creating new constructed language or using an existing constructed language as an official language of the eu is a total nonsense . 
  we do n't need any artificially created pan-european language . 
  in my opinion the best policy is the one european union took by fully embracing linguistic diversity and promoting eu citizens learning new languages - promoting not just english , but all of them . 
  there are [ 24 official eu languages ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm ) that receive translation of every eu document and [ over 60 regional languages ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/regional-minority-languages_en.htm ) that eu promotes through few programs , both directly and indirectly . 
  as a side-effect of globalisation more and more people learn english and * de facto * english is the lingua franca of european union - and as the time goes by it will only enforce it 's position in a natural way instead of being forced upon people . 
   english has many exceptions to its grammar rules , plenty of synonyms and spelling that is inconsistent with pronunciation . 
  every single natural language has that . 
   as a result you have to memorize more than a language that has consistent grammar , no or very few synonyms and spelling that is consistent with pronunciation . 
  it 's part of what learning language is . 
  it 's not a problem , but yes - it does make learning more difficult . 
  but also makes language richer . 
   we could create a language from scratch that would be very easy to learn for people with a germanic/romantic/slavic background ( europeans ) , that 's already done . 
  esperanto is that language that 's artificially created and very easy to learn by people with european background . 
   it would however be a long term investment not an investment . 
  it 'd be a scam-scheme for some people to fill their pockets with money as that whole project is bound to fail .

   i 'm strictly against only using english . 
  languages are part of our culture and every language is unique and special .
