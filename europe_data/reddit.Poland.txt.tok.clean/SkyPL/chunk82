  well then , you 'll be happy to know that unlike author of this thread - european union fully embraces linguistic diversity and promotes eu citizens learning new languages - promoting not just english , but all of them . 
  there are [ 24 official eu languages ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm ) that receive translation of every eu document and [ over 60 regional languages ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/regional-minority-languages_en.htm ) that eu promotes through few programs , both directly and indirectly . 
  each time i read something about vostochny it looks more and more like soviet-style megaproject build back in a good old days of * father stalin * . 
   its leader mateusz piskorski wait wait wait ... [ mateusz piskorski ] ( https://stopnacjonalizmowi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/a884bed390e5ad29450e4c3f18404d3e4c5bf8f8.jpg ) , the nazi guy , is supporting russians ? 
  hahahahaha . 
   can we go for multiple standard languages then ? 
  that 's what we have right now . 
  ** [ there are 24 official eu languages ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm ) ** . 
  it 's quite misleading map filled with multiple factual mistakes . 
  probably the worst sin is that it gives you very false impression that russia only expanded through the history while in fact it was fighting multiple wars loosing and gaining territories dozens of times over history ( eg . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth cut quite deeply into russian territory ) . 
   i only pointed out why your simpleton solution of `` just lock everyone lulz '' is n't realistic . 
  now you 're making me say things i did n't because you do n't have a point . 
  what 's your problem ? 
  first you are saying something i never said and then you accuse me of doing the same ? 
  what is it , kindergarden ? 
  re-read my post , then think about it for a moment before posting again . 
   sure , some dirt-poor african country is going to accept europeans dumping thousands upon thousands of even more dirt-poor people on their territory , whether they actually come from that place or not . 
  they will surely get along great with the locals and the host country will definitely be able to spare the resources to deal with them . 
  fyi : australia is already doing that , just take an example from a working solution . 
  and yes - it can work if you will pay to the government . 
  general intention is that most should declare where they came from and preferably be send to their country of origin , otherwise be sent to whichever country agrees to accept them , be it africa , asia , middle east , i do n't really care , but africa makes most sense as that 's closest location to the origin of most of the immigrants . 
  there are legal ways to get into europe . 
  if people do n't follow the rule of law - they should suffer consequences . 
  ignoring the problem only makes it bigger - french government and police did ** nothing ** to stop what happens in calais for years now . 
  and each year problem becomes bigger and bigger as more and more people learn that they can do whatever with next to no consequences . 
  scenes like that one here will happen only more and more often unless french are going to change their approach . 
  so what , migrants can stand above and beyond law because you have no space in prison to keep them if they break law ? 
  what kind of banana-republic law is that ?!, 
  and they would accept them if you would get in agreement with local government for deporting them there . 
  drivers and transport companies are a victims in this case . 
  migrants that actually are victims were granted asylum and do n't break into a truck trailers to be smuggled into uk , cause they have all the papers needed to cross the border legally . 
   you ca n't kick them out if you do n't officially know where they come from if they are legal migrants stealing and damaging property - lock them in a prisons . 
  cause right now they 're above law for some unexplained reasons , and somehow drivers and companies are paying price for police being unable to execute your own country law . 
  and if they are illegal - that 's what australia is doing :  if they are found not to be genuine refugees they may be repatriated to their country of origin or be sent to a safe third country other than australia . 
  so give them a choice : either they declare where they came from or kick them out to some random african country . 
  this will mobilize everyone to tell the truth . 
  allowing illegal immigrants to sit in calais stealing and damaging property is no solution at all . 
  and that 's what france is doing - nothing to solve the problem even though they got all the power required to stop this proceeder from continuing . 
   the critics point out that the experience of being shot through a tube for half an hour or longer , without a view and without being able to move from one 's seat , might not appeal to everyone . 
  jesus , people and their imaginary problems . 
  i 'm quite sure they are biased , due to similarities in a flag color , 
   poland  rank : 47  rank change : -29  18 in 2015 there 's the effect of our new government `` fighting for freedom of speech '' and `` restoring pluralism in media '' . 
  i know , it 's still a huge mess , some lines run font 14 , other run 8 , how difficult it can be to write a whole thing in one consistent , readable size ? 
  i 'm amazed that he did n't put `` separated from serbia '' in font size 2pt , just to fit it in that small space . 
  they do n't , but they are n't similar to sanders either , and their target demographic is much more similar to the one trump has , even if policy-wise it 's not the same . 
  not really , they go far beyond what sanders wants . 
  sanders asks for things like free education ( standard in most of the eu ) , having parties funded by the government ( standard in most of the eu ) , public health care ( standard in most of the eu ) , lgbt and women 's equality ( not great , but eu is still ahead of us ) , racial equality ( recently it 's getting worse in the eu ) , etc. 
  he never asks for as socialist stuff such as polish 500 + . 
  by european standards all you can tell is that he is not far-right , as pretty much only far-right wingers are against all this stuff that we take for granted , and sanders wants to implement in the us . 
  you know , having fonts large enough so that i would n't have to use my electron microscope to read the text would convince me not to downvote it into hell . 
   eu was never meant to be political power , but only trade union . 
  it 's a myth repeated by eurosceptics that has nothing to deal with reality . 
  even before eu became eu it was already meant to be a political union , and so did envision it the founding fathers . 
  as a random example of many take a look at the treaty establishing the european economic community , already back then they established almost all of the major political organs of the ( to-be ) union and were looking forward to the united states of europe . 
  tl ; dr :  in early 2017 , poland was supposed to unveil what is perhaps the most ambitious museum devoted to world war ii in any country ( ... ) unlike other museums devoted to history 's most devastating war , which tend to begin and end with national history , the gda\u0144sk museum has set out to show the perspectives of societies around the world ( ... ) the current polish government , led by the conservative law and justice party , now seems determined to cancel the museum , on the grounds that it does not express `` the polish point of view . '' and a bit more details if you want :  ( ... ) perhaps for poland 's current leadership , this is the problem . 
  for a full understanding of the holocaust makes it very difficult to divide european nations simply into perpetrators and victims . 
  ( ... ) for all the government 's misgivings , there will be plenty of polish heroism on display ( ... ) without the gda\u0144sk museum , these polish contributions are likely to remain in obscurity . 
   ( ... ) perhaps the greatest surprise in the polish government 's decision is the implicit alliance with current * russian * memory policy . 
  the move to limit the polish history of world war ii to the week-long engagement with germany at westerplatte in 1939 follows a russian script that is entirely on the record . 
  ( ... ) the german attack on poland , putin asserts , was a consequence of poland 's own dealings with nazi germany before the war , rather than a result of the soviet-german alliance of 1939  ( ... ) a generation from now no one will care about the political feuds that animate warsaw today . 
  but it is certain that thousands of polish families will remember that their precious gifts of family heirlooms were accepted and then refused . 
  ( ... ) most seriously of all , the effects of suppressing national memory could be of critical importance to poles in coming decades , and to a global audience that has yet to fully absorb the complicated lessons of world war ii . 
   ( ... ) the collapse of democracy , the museum 's first theme , could hardly be more salient than it is right now . 
  and the presentation of the conflict as a global tragedy could hardly be more instructive . 
  the preemptive liquidation of the museum is nothing less than a violent blow to the world 's cultural heritage . 
  though honestly - go and read the whole thing . 
  it 's worth it . 
  even if the museum wo n't be build - you will learn about one of these few amazing things that * should have been * ... and perhaps you will even learn some fascinating yet a bit less known parts of history .

  quite amazing , it 's much more than i expected . 
  [ so did poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cursed_soldiers ) , though we got the short straw , ended up with having nkvd & their friends putting people in a mass graves ... 
  not the real capital \u2122, 
  [ but poland can into space ] ( http://kosmonauta.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/images_stories_2014_polska_brite_lem1-640x336.jpg ) !, 
  ( that is minus the fact that the best , biggest satellites poland ever built were an equivalent of one [ us elementary school made ] ( http://www.parabolicarc.com/2015/12/07/nasa-launches-cubesat-built-elementary-school-students/ ) and still required components built abroad ... 
  i 'll show myself out ), 
  [ unity day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unity_day_%28russia%29 ) is viewed by many in poland as russians still having a grudge over these events . 
  good luck explaining that it 's not the case . 
  ( edit : that last sentence does not mean you should follow up with explaining to me why . 
  i know it 's not , i 'm just pointing out that the average pole does n't know and it 's difficult to explain it to him ), 
   every time they were strong , the poles prospered , every time they were weak the poles got fisted . 
  i assure you that this is not what they teach in a polish schools , not during the days of communism , not after regaining independence , not now . 
  also you grossly overestimate the level of education , most of the people after they 're done with school end up having few selected myths ( in case of poland it 's between others things like `` targowica '' , `` screwed by french and brits/western betrayal '' , `` ungrateful west '' , `` the ultimate devil - russia '' ) that they will blindly repeat without ever digging into the topic . 
  and there 's nothing specific to poland either , most people from all around the world function that way ( `` gim me gim me east '' would be a great example ) , you 're way above average in terms of historical knowledge and while i understand your frustration , you should n't be surprised , not everyone are interested in the subject enough , but it does n't stop them from having opinions , even if they 're grossly inaccurate . 
  some people ca n't get over the stuff they read in a history book few weeks ago , some ca n't get over the stuff they read on a wikipedia few months ago ... the usual business , you know . 
  from what i recall it 's still very much work in progress , with a transition to be completed in 2020 ? 
  i do n't know exact details , sorry , but afaik they already did some trainings under swapped command and it worked pretty well . 
  they already have a few exchange programmes with poland , including german batallion under polish command ( i think it 's panzergrenadierbataillon 411 ) and a polish battalion under german command ( 34 brygada kawalerii pancernej )  i 'm also interested in the fusion of nexter and kmw [ that 's already done . 
  ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/56670/nexter-kmw-complete-merger ), 
  not even poland likes poland ( see : `` has collapsed '' ) . 
  that 's a very poor translation . 
  the actual result is `` why denmark is a prison '' , though for me it 's a 4th result , before that i get `` is rich '' , `` does n't have euro '' and `` did not accept euro '' . 
  and the answer to the question is :  hamlet m\u00f3wi : \u201e dania jest wi\u0119zieniem '' [ hamlet says `` denmark 's a prison '' ] ( http://nfs.sparknotes.com/hamlet/page_106.html ) . 
  i guess it 's high schoolers googling stuff for their homework . 
  and poles feel like pointing that out on every occasion . 
  truly magnificent . 
  yea , it 's mostly the effect of a current government . 
  and i fully expect rating you seen to go way down with current eurosceptic party pumping propaganda through the national tv . 
  same in poland , with small difference - 5 % for individual parties , 8 % for coalitions - only valid votes count ( * \u00a7 1 . 
   out of any current eu country , the uk is best placed to prosper outside the bloc yes , which is precisely why eu officials are afraid of the prospect .
