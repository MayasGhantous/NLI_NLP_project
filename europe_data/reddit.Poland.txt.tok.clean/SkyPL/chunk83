  it will give eurosceptics a strong argument , at the same time forgetting that poland , greece or spain quitting eu would end up having a different outcome . 
  vw management should realize that they 're in a business of making cars and not gasoline . 
  there are eubgs , though it 's far from ` standing army ' . 
  and there 's also eda worth mentioning . 
  but otherwise - good post . 
  yes , this and a high position of szyd\u0142o were probably the biggest surprises . 
  it has to be tunisia , otherwise does n't count , 
  it 's a chicken and an egg problem , really . 
  helping to lower the car price is more efficient in solving it , as cars can be recharged at home , while having empty recharge stations helps only the richest . 
  well done !, 
  now there 's officially a new spaceport on earth , 
  it was the case in us and ussr , but not in europe . 
  european space development was close to civilian efforts , and political background , even before esa formed . 
  one of the major points of pride for esa is that it 's one of very few purely civilian space agencies . 
  i 'm not saying * if * , i 'm saying * how * . 
  and yes , of course . 
  it 's small in space exploration - which is a topic of this discussion . 
  no need for another poland ... 
  imho they are just wondering how to sell it to public , but they will back him . 
  it 's a problematic decision pr-wise , but he 's a political opponent they 'd rather not have in their backyard . 
  let 's put some facts on a table : * moon village is to be the post-iss effort . 
  there wo n't be any large financial support as long as the iss is going . 
  * these images of a facilities on a surface are a distant , distant future ( 2030s , 2040s ) . 
  first we 'd have an orbital facility located either on the edge of the gravity well or [ l2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagrangian_point ) . 
  * a lot of surface exploration will be done by landers and rovers , telerobotics - there 's no point building large landers to facilitate human landing on a surface if you can have your hands on a surface in real time , at any time via robot ( which is also why you need to have an outpost on the orbit - that 's the only way to have an acceptable ping times for teleoperations ) . 
  * just as i make this post esa tests teleoperations of the rover in stevenage , uk from iss . 
  just one of many efforts that esa already does towards the moon village . 
  * major role for esa during the first years will be an initiator and coordinator . 
  it wo n't be another effort where one agency covers most of the expenses while other provides transportation ( which is what iss is now ) . 
  esa wants to involve as many parties as possible , from private companies through small space agencies to the major players . 
  * yes , esa does not have it 's own manned spacecraft , it does n't need it , and still wo n't need it when moon village steps in , the idea at the moment is that orion will be used ( transporting people to the orbital station ) , but also russian and chinese spacecrafts can provide transportation . 
  * there 's some hope that the first decisions will be made in december this year on a ministerial council meeting , but even then - do n't expect any large commitments ( like space news and others do ) , noone will be asking for that . 
  at this point it 's about studies and clarifying the project . 
  we 'll still very early on . 
  do n't hype it too much . 
  shame that it 's not reflected in our contributions to the space exploration . 
  esa does really great work despite of budget they have , but it should n't be the case , we should either be leading or be the close second . 
  moon village concept-wise could facilitate it , but it needs to be forged into real money and real political support in order to work . 
  it wo n't be a colonization , but rather an international scientific effort . 
  so no - it wo n't be part of schengen , and in fact it wo n't be european either . 
  esa currently plays the role of initiator and coordinator , it 's not meant to be european effort , it 's meant to be a global effort with everyone willing involved , not just big players , but also smaller nations ( israel , brasil , etc. 
  ) , and not just nations , but also commercial partners . 
  current idea is to have a station in l2 or edge of the gravity well and grow from there . 
  of course . 
  even moon village is planned to be largely based on robotics - be it rovers , telerobotics , or lunar satellites . 
  sure . 
  building iss never stopped progress on the earth , quite the opposite - iss and a space exploration as such provided countless technologies that helped making this planet sustainable , helped spreading education and motivating people to join into engineering fields . 
  even india understands the benefits of space exploration and they do n't even have a flippin toilets in roughly 50 % of homes . 
  heck - even in star trek , silly sci-fi where authors could made up whatever they wanted - they thought that human race would travel to a different stars ( ! ), 
  before solving the problems on earth . 
  it 's a longer story of our constitutional crisis .

  fun trivia : warsaw was re-build at the cost of the entire country . 
  sending bricks from damaged or destroyed buildings to warsaw was very common . 
  similar thing happened to various pieces of art that were sent as a * recovered territories gifts to the capital * .

  fuck that . 
  there 's a lot of changes happening as we speak , and sadly - they seem to be drifting more towards 1930s than a global peace . 
  [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1k239g/cameron_we_need_to_look_at_scrapping_the_human/cbkmj03 ) has a list with some highlights . 
  btw : you are missing http : / / from your url , that 's why it 's not linking . 
   but there is nothing stopping signatories from providing stronger protections . 
  you are missing the point . 
  echr is there to stop signatories from breaking the bare minimum of protection , [ something that uk does have a problem with ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1k239g/cameron_we_need_to_look_at_scrapping_the_human/cbkmj03 ) . 
  problem with your example is that he would n't . 
  in this case it seems that brexiters know that there 's something off with the camp they are in , that nationalism they build up might not be welcome with the open arms , but at the same time they are not ready to admit that they might be wrong . 
  their own nationalism is fine , but french is evil and should be banned . 
  laughable . 
  funny , but the usual arguments will inevitably pop '' * we 've always had and always will have all of that without filthy echr !, 
  i find it amusing how brexiters want to hide their supporters . 
  so : who they are , what do they want , and what 's their policy to the balkan neighbours ? 
  eu contributes more to the esa budget than any single nation does . 
  few points , for this post and the other you made : * man-rating is a nasa certification that does n't apply to any other space agency * ariane 6 is as capable of lifting manned vehicle as ariane 5 * that said though - currently there are not concrete plans for using either launch vehicle for manned flights , and csg does n't have any infrastructure to support manned missions * dc4eu according to the current plans would be launched unmanned , similar to the nasa 's crs-2 missions ( starting 2019 , foldable wings , under the fairing ) , just not towards iss . 
  manned flights are doable from purely technical point of view , but esa is missing most of the stuff around the rocket and orbiter ( infrastructure , procedures , etc. 
  etc. ) . 
  * esa is perfectly fine with launching astronauts in the spacecrafts of other nations , be it russia as it is now , or us ( orion ) / china/private in future . 
  this plan is still on a table , from what i remember it will be discussed in december , during biennial ministerial council meeting , but do n't expect any concrete decisions just yet . 
  integrating esa with eu would significantly simplify bureaucracy for both : the agency and the eu , saving time and money ( yes , the eu is not a hellhole of bureaucracy some people try to picture it as ) . 
  that 's roughly correct . 
  they call this graphical element `` fingerprint '' , it 's shape is the one of earth , stripes symbolize orbit , dot is a satellite in the outer space , e stands for europe . 
  it actually is increasing , quite consistently during last years . 
  hold your horses there , they do not have any carriers , it 's forbidden . 
  all they have are innocent * destroyers * .

  tremendous deal !,

  / u/tacobenderz is correct , china is against it too , but it 's hardly the only one . 
  in fact even finance ministers of the entire g20 released statement saying that brexit poses danger for the international stability . 
  brexiter : we 'll strike new deals with the us & the world . 
  us & the world : do n't do it , bro . 
  brexiter : shut up !, 
  what 's it got to do with you ? 
  the one third on a right , 
  in most of the democracies people never elect ministers and in some cases even a prime minister . 
  usually you elect an mp that then becomes a prime minister or a minister ( and in some countries : can be changed for another person at any time without any elections ) though even that 's not necessary , eg . 
  polish constitution allows us to have a minister that never was an mp and we had quite a few - especially finance ministers where often having someone competent is much more important than having someone with a large public support . 
  in this scenario winning party select a minister - which is almost the same as the system under which junker was selected . 
  the only difference is that junker got a mandate from directly elected european parliment , while selected ministers in poland are not being voted on by our parliament , instead they are * appointed * by the president and then an entire government receives a vote of confidence from sejm . 
  so * de facto * junker has a stronger mandate . 
  ( that said though - ministers in poland can be voted on if a motion of no confidence is initiated ),
