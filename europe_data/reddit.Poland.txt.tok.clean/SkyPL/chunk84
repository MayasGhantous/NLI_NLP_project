   it was fought between socialists ` reds ' and conservative ` whites ' i see one side had a clear tactical advantage in terms of camouflage ...  the war ended in white victory ha !, 
  told ya !, 
  lesson for future : pick less conspicious colors . 
  sanders policy on central and western europe is pretty much the same . 
  he wants to protect us from any form of russian aggression , would vote for nato intervention , wants to continue increasing a number of troops in region , etc. 
  he basically says that us should maintain obama 's position in our region . 
  the major difference comparing to clinton is on further expansion of nato , that he does n't want to see while clinton does . 
  as long as us elects democrat - we 're good . 
  so it 's settled then : torrent . 
  aside from the fact that it 's very likely made just for a campaign : well , knowing that a turtle is gay can be a disadvantage if you plan to breed it - but it will also be an important advantage if you do n't want any more turtles ...  btw : '' * is it contagious ?

  we have to survive * only * 1303 days till the next elections . 
  public pressure is real . 
  i remain hopeful . 
  she did not play there ?!, 
  damn , that 's disappointing . 
  she does n't know how to play along :( first of all - deaf children can * feel * the rhythm , and secondly : staff would absolutely enjoy it .

  having an opposite opinion to wykop.pl is n't exactly a challenge - it 's enough if you get rid of all teenagers . 
  from all the crisis that could possibly destroy the eu - moral definitely is n't the one . 
  fortunately they did not - i invite you to [ the official website of teutonic order ] ( http://www.deutscher-orden.de/gb/ ) . 
  tl ; dr : eu did good , but earlier studies saying that pesticides banned affect bumblebees were wrong . 
  bullets , shell casings , etc. 
  never heard of anyone finding anything from pre-industrial era , though obviously there are hobbyists with metal detectors finding this stuff . 
  unanimous vote is used for [ more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_in_the_council_of_the_european_union#unanimity ) things than just suspension . 
  and it 's reasonable to demand that decision making process should n't be crippled if a country finds 1 buddy that supports it . 
  sure , i can agree that double majority might be not enough , say : 66 +66 % could be a better measure ( i 'm throwing that number out of a sleeve , though in most countries 2/3rds majority is enough to change the constitution , the very fundament of the state ) , but i strongly disagree that unanimous vote is a way to go for any decision making process . 
  your question is ridiculous . 
  i might just as well ask this : why being right winged is incompatible with following the law ? 
  you do n't understand how double majority works . 
  it is not a simple , population-based majority . 
  german guy wo n't have much say in anything unless he builds a large coalition across the union . 
  even germany + france + italy + uk+s pain + poland + romania + netherlands + belgium + greece ( 10 most populous countries in the eu , 416 million people out of 508 million eu citizens ) wo n't have any say on their own in a double majority . 
  if anything - double majority gives unproportional power to the small states , but at the same time it does n't cripple decision making process like unanimous voting does . 
  and stop scaremongering with germany , cause it 's getting ridiculous . 
  unanimous voting is essentially a system with liberum veto where any tiny country can block decision on which everyone else agree . 
  it 's not least bad system . 
  it 's a horrible system . 
  imho any decision that requires unanimous voting should be replaced by a [ double majority ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/qualified_majority.html ) ( 55 % of countries & 65 % of population ), 
  depends what you mean by `` relevant enough '' . 
  if you mean overthrowing the government - than i would prefer that not to happen , even if i 'm strongly against their actions . 
  if you mean relevant enough to affect the government - regrettably they do n't seem to care regardless of the scale of protests . 
   public dissent ( because one thing it wo n't be is spontaneous public dissent already is spontaneous . 
  imagine that people can find actions of the current government outrageous without getting paid for that . 
  eu parliment can do more than one thing . 
  tusk got nothing to deal with that . 
  though i find it super-amusing how you found a way to blame it on him . 
   with their own opinion if that * opinion * ( it 's not about opinion , but rather their actions ) is breaking constitution , crippling constitutional tribunal and pissing on the basic principles of the union - yes . 
  we absolutely should . 
  3 and a half year till elections . 
  you already can approach that subject .

  oh ... yes ... 
  i recall getting british metro once ... they had a gigantic headline there with a whole sentence from which not even a single line was truth . 
  no , it was n't the eu , no decision was made , and it was n't about whatever metro claimed . 
  i actually made a photograph of it for laughs , but ca n't find it : /, 
   more and more people i know are converting . 
  that 's ... an interesting choice of words . 
  i find it funny how it unintentionally implies that all the brexit camp is doing is a religious-alike demagogy . 
  ... and exactly where from did hitler come ? 
  jungle in south america ?

  * poland * * you do n't like what we 're doing ? 
  you 're misinformed .

  it means new zealand .

  he says that whatever germany invited terrorists or [ not ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) did not matter much , it was n't a source of this attack . 
  these terrorists were here long before germany opened it 's mouth on a subject . 
   germany calls for increased information sharing among eu countries about fucking time . 
  same with the eu counter-intelligence service - that also should be already done . 
  though arguably it 'd be better if some other country would be in a headline here seeing how these days many people automatically reject everything germany does ( no easy way out from that situation , obviously ) . 
  i do n't think you understand a difference between geographical names and the name of a city in a foreign language or informal term . 
  i struggle to think of any relevant example in polish geography , but if that works : i would n't mind calling warmia-mazury a south-west prussia ( though it 's not really accurate cause warmia-mazury is larger than just south-western prussia ), 
  well , no shit . 
  just think of of the * corruption in the world countries . 
  * now that would be one enormous number !, 
  irish think that their island does not belong to the [ british isles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles ) ? 
  now that 's a new one ... how do you call it then ? 
  irish isles ? 
   british isles is as far as i know universally accepted name for this group of islands in pretty much all of the languages . 
  can think of a few worse ... but basically every default sub is a nightmare . 
  * falklands , in polish : falklandy * distance to the uk is not the reason why argentina claims falklands should be their . 
  but anyway - no , i think that in this very specific case it 's uk that should keep the islands . 
  * it should be looked at on case-by-case basis .
