  still there 's a [ descend camera ] ( http://exploration.esa.int/mars/54333-deca-the-descent-camera-on-schiaparelli/ ) , so we will see * something * from schiaparelli ... just ... looking down ... which is quite ... * meh * . 
  just to avoid any misconceptions : for scientific reasons it 's far more useful than a camera heading in any other direction , allows you to accurately determine where schiaparelli landed and how the landing site might affect measurements , but from a pr and a history book perspective it 's quite a huge loss - what might be the first successful european lander on mars will end up having no landscape or self-portraits . 
   the eu is only responsible for copernicus and galileo that 's not exactly true . 
  eu has both : programmes targeted at a specific projects like copernicus and galileo , as well as a direct contribution to the esa budget , just like nations do . 
  in fact : eu contributes more money to the european space agency than uk does ( with all the programmes included it 's over 4 times more , this year it increased by ~ 30 % ) . 
  how much of eu budget on space will be cut is impossible to determine . 
  at this point there is no national share of eu budget , there 's just eu budget , period . 
  this makes any such estimations very difficult to accomplish . 
  especially now , where junkers administration is increasing eu involvement in science . 
  uk budget in esa is 8.7 % . 
  if you 'd want to be out altogether it 'd mean a loss of ~ 324.8 million euro ( as of 2016 budget ) . 
  this might not look like much , but it will be a hole difficult to plug . 
  to give you a better picture - in 2016 the whole budget of manned spaceflight was 365.1 million euro , that includes 2 astronaut missions ( peake & pesquet ) , training , experiments , soyuz flights and all the support . 
  still though eu budget is increasing ( 2014 : 4102.1 mln $ , 2015 : 4433 mln $ , 2016 : 5250 mln $ ) so while british contribution will be difficult to plug - i would n't say it 's impossible . 
  that said though money is n't as important as a loss for scientists - something highlighted by numerous people ( even hawking pointed that out ) . 
  there 's even an initiative [ scientists for eu ] ( http://scientistsforeu.uk/ ) . 
  and that 'd be a loss for both : scientists on the continent and in the uk , as brits are involved in all of the major projects , heck : some of the best-known scientists of the agency are british ( eg . 
  matt taylor - project scientist for rosetta ) . 
  i never said that they burn it down to the last drop . 
  it 's vented . 
  point being : there 's no explosion on impact like with failed recovery attempts of falcon 9 , which still have quite a substantial amount of fuel . 
  2nd burn just confirmed to be successful !, 
  [ edit ] 3rd burn confirmed . 
  so far so good !, 
  upper stage dropped its external tank . 
  this will be followed by a fourth burn , and then , finally - separation at 20:12:45 utc . 
  next big news will be on 16 october 2016 - separation of schiaparelli from the orbiter . 
   then all rockets exploded . 
  no , they do n't . 
  in * a proper * expendable launch vehicles fuel is ~ ~ used ~ ~ gone ( that would be more accurate wording , if we really want to complain about wording down to this level ) by the time they hit the ground . 
  there is no spectacular explosion . 
  still explosion . 
  and still a failure ( of a post-launch test ) . 
  everyone do have a graphics , that 's not what we are talking about here , 
  if you say  spacex only exploded once . 
  then everything counts . 
  though yes , that 's a nice overview of all launches they made for their clients , if we count only them than in deed - they had only one major failure during the launch , and several after . 
   in many spacex videos they covered all the way i 'm quite sure that they never did it . 
  ( to clarify : never had a live video stream from onboard the rocket all the way through the launch ), 
  it 's not age that 's the problem . 
  it 's politics . 
  russia does n't want to rely on a launch pad abroad . 
  more than once . 
  i was saying more in general than about this launch  though i still wait rather impatient , knowing that the last issues proton had were the upper stage under-performing and an explosion of it ( though luckily - after the separation ) . 
  watch one of the spacex live streams ? 
  it 's not a constant live stream , but they [ definitely do stream after 10km ] ( https://youtu.be/mudpsyo7-a0?t=810 ) . 
  sorry , i do n't have any source for you , perhaps someone else got time to google it . 
  to be fair : proton is n't exactly stellar in that department either ... 
  in theory it could be pre-recorded as ivan suggested , but weather it matching what you see on a ground , so it must be live . 
  they just confirmed that so far everything goes exactly as planned . 
  first upper stage burn was confirmed to complete successfully . 
  live stream is over for now . 
  it 's live . 
  same way spacex is doing it . 
  it 's not a huge problem , just another layer of infrastructure that 's not really necessary for launch . 
  cameras on rockets are fairly rare . 
  pretty much only us companies do that ( for pr ) . 
  fuck work . 
  exciting launch happens !, 
  [ reposting ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4a6dbu/europe_goes_to_mars_esa_and_roscosmos_embark_on_a/d0y3qzo?context=3 ) , the mission overview : * esa and roscosmos send spacecraft to mars . 
  it 's called trace gas orbiter ( tgo ) , it will carry a lander called schiaparelli * it 's a first half of joint exomars program , second half will launch in 2018 - it 'll be exomars rover and another lander ( `` surface science platform '' ) * primary role of schiaparelli is to test reentry and landing before 2018 mission . 
  but it 's also a short-lived meteo station ( they are hoping for 4 days ) . 
  it 'll be the first landing on mars during dust storm season . 
  * tgo will study the atmosphere of mars using a set of [ spectrometers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spectrometer ) ( in fact they 'll offer resolution several times higher than on any other spacecraft ever orbiting mars ) . 
  it will give an insight into the seasonal fluctuations of methane and hopefully answer the fundamental question : is methane on mars created through geological process or biological . 
  if that would happen and a results would be conclusive - it would be the first ever indirect detection of life on another planet . 
  * tgo is the largest and heaviest spacecraft ever to go to mars ( even larger and heavier than curiosity lander or mro ( the spacecraft that sent most of the color photographs you 've seen ) ) . 
  it 's also the most power-hungry one ( over twice the power demand of mro ) with largest solar panels ( over twice the area of mro panels ) * schiaparelli does not have a camera to make a photographs after the landing . 
  so do n't expect any fancy views * tgo on the other hand does have a camera , but it 's resolution is n't ... spectacular ( 4.5 m/px comparing to mro 0.3 m/px & mars express 2.3 m/px ) , it 'll be used mostly for matching the results from spectrometers against a terrain . 
  other missions are there for photography . 
  * tgo is equipped with 2.2-meter antenna dish to communicate with earth and a set of nasa-built transceivers to get a signal from and to rovers on a surface . 
  it will work as a communication satellite for both : existing and future rovers on a surface . 
  while not as impressive as mro communication set - it will enable more frequent communication windows . 
  * it 'll be one of the most ... * exciting * launches in recent history . 
  it 's quite an unique payload launched on a proton , rocket that suffered various failures in last 10 years . 
  proton variant in question never did any launch beyond earth orbit . 
  so pray to the roman god mars for a successful launch ... 
  basically : yes . 
  it can distinguish different [ isotopologue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isotopologue ) s , not only of methane , but also several other molecules that combined will help determining their origin . 
  [ here you can read a paper ] ( http://mars.aeronomie.be/multimedia/pdf/vandaele_15c.pdf ) covering one of the instruments - nomad - that also explains ch4 detection ( page 4 , top-left ) .

  hope you find it interesting , though . 
  wow , i had to scroll down all the way here to see some truly sensible post .
