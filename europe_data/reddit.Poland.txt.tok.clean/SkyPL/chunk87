  sometimes i doubt many people making posts like most of the people here even know where greek islands are , eg . 
  [ lesbos is here ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/lesbos,+greece/@38.8727244,25.3580988,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x14af8516edc7f755:0x8627d601b32663e7 ) - everything north , east and south is where from immigrants come . 
  this one island alone has 320 km coastline , compared to 175 km fence that hungary built . 
  i 'm under a strong impression that people simply have no clue just how difficult it is to * secure the border * from such a huge number of people ( and in before someone from belarus posts about using automated gun turrents bought from israel - no , it 's not an option ) . 
   they would be probably more than happy to borrow you those ships to be used in mass deportations of the illegals to the libyan coast . 
  actually - i seen people posting similar suggestions on various polish defence-related sites . 
  so while i presume you just made up most of this post - you are not far off from what actually got suggested . 
  and while landing crafts do n't really get a wide support - using ships for cost-efficient deportations is fairly common opinion around here . 
  do french know about it ? 
   cause , you know , to get on a list you need both sides disputing the dispute , 
   madagascar claims french-administered europa island . 
  the fuck ?!, 
  \\* triggered \\* europe for europeans !!!, 
  i do n't get it :(, 
  wow ... they actually did pick it after all . 
  i 'm very surprised . 
  thought that after all the trouble they would go for something decent ( cause out of previous ~ 400 suggestions i struggled to find 10 that i would consider good enough ) . 
  instead we got trip back to '90s . 
  oh well ... if someone asks - tell them it 's in a shape of [ x-files ufo ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/x-files/images/0/01/fox_mulder_under_triangular_ufo.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640 ) . 
  yep . 
  you guys got basically an ms paint , right there . 
  still [ hard to race with new zealand ] ( http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/zgkymde1lza1lze4l2m5l256lmvindyzlmpwzwpwcxrodw1ictk1mhg1mzqjcmujanbn/20bdf07e/416/nz.jpg ), 
   again dude , what would be the connection with poland ? 
  i do n't know ... how about this text on a right ? 
  does it really have to [ look like that ] ( http://p2.sfora.pl/950527a272cbb8295f2ea012c55811b6.jpg ) to make you happy ? 
  somehow [ cnes ] ( http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/dlr_1.jpg ) or [ dlr ] ( http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/dlr_1.jpg ) do n't have the problems you do . 
  and [ leave china out of it ] ( http://blogimg.ngfiles.com/252000/252256/097478557_n577019890_925580_3109.jpg )  . 
   but it is closer left ideologically than conservative judging by average pole that just elected pis - it might be . 
  but objectively - no . 
   and we are in poland , place that differs from west standards in many aspects . 
  it really does n't . 
  go abroad , or something ? 
  our right wing throws words without any attention to what they actually mean , and that tends to be more of a problem than anything else . 
  if someone is called by them '' * leftist * '' it does n't automatically make him ( far ) left wing . 
   former sld was extrem left that 's the most funny bit . 
  they really are n't . 
  they are centre-left , or if you want to push it : left . 
  there 's nothing extreme-left about them . 
  they are capitalist post-communists , more like a social democrats than far left . 
  they had a marek belka as a finance minister , he 's more liberal than almost anyone in pis , haha . 
   it is a matter of opinion . 
  nope . 
  it 's literally the matter of constitution . 
   president has different opinion and no political power can do anything about it . 
  yes , it can . 
  not now , but after the change of parliamentary majority - state tribunal for not following the constitution is a real scenario . 
   they have appointed their 5 for what they had no right . 
  during this cadence of the government they could appoint 2 judges at most . 
  alternative would be to appoint none , and wait for the verdict . 
  there was no scenario in which they had a legal right to appoint 5 judges , other than the one they made up , one which came out to be against constitution . 
   ( directly against constitution ) it 's not . 
  tribunal explained it in quite a detail . 
  they could n't make a verdict based on a bill that was a subject of the proceedings . 
  that would be against constitution . 
  but no wonder people are confused - it 's very rare circumstance and constitution did not address it directly , which while being a mistake , was n't a terminal one . 
  [ here you can read more details ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/49o5cs/polands_constitutional_tribunal_rules_against/ ) , though the whole story is rather long , spanning back till mid 2015 . 
  as for the image itself - government refuses to publish the verdict of the constitutional tribunal so people published the verdict on a walls of prime minister 's office . 
  [ edit ] [ wsj story ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/49px9o/polish_government_refuses_to_publish/d0u1a0n ) posted by other redditor that gives a decent overview of the situation . 
   head of ct decides who will take part in ruling and how many judges will be needed . 
  for this ruling he actually used all the judges he legally could . 
  ( sorry for polish , but i do n't know english well enough to translate that accurately ), 
  by wikipedia , * previous government : centre-right ( [ po ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_platform ) ) + centre-right ( [ psl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_people's_party ) ) coalition * current government : right-wing ( [ pis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_and_justice ) ) keep in mind that for a current government everyone not more to the right than they , are automatically '' * leftists * '' . 
  [ court explanation why , how , and why it 's legal , in polish , lengthy & rather difficult for average joe , but if you are curious - that 's the official stance ] ( http://trybunal.gov.pl/rozprawy/komunikaty-prasowe/komunikaty-po/art/8860-nowelizacja-ustawy-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym/ ), 
  it is simpler then you try to make it . 
  - 3 judges appointed during the cadence of a previous government have to be sworn by the president - still pending , still to be done . 
  - remaining 2 judges appointed by the previous government executed the ruling of the tribunal and did not took the office - so that 's case closed . 
  - 2 judges appointed by the current government are judges in every meaning of that word - they took part in a latest ruling - here everything is fine , case closed . 
  - remaining 3 judges sworn either should be completely dismissed ( non-compromise option ) or become a judges one by one as the cadence of previous judges runs out ( compromise ) - that 's also still an open topic , though informally pis is fine with that . 
  the end game is that there 's only one thing to do : president has to fulfill his duty and take a sworn from judges . 
  either this or state tribunal after the change of parliamentary majority . 
   but instead they dismissed them all ( 5 ) for what they had absolutely no right . 
  just as well i might dismiss judges appointed by pis , and i 'll likely have more right to do so ( based on their competences and a text of constitution that refers to who judges should be - art . 
  1 ) than they do . 
  whoever got that idea - it was truly brilliant . 
  and hilarious . 
  and horribly , horribly sad at the same time . 
  the best of luck to you all !, 
  there 's also a facebook action [ an entire poland is publishing verdict of the constitutional tribunal , without a delay ] ( https://www.facebook.com/inyourfacekempa/ ) ( btw : i just noticed - that url , hahaha ) , it 's the second time government got an issue with publishing the verdict and the second time this profile got active ( last time they did publish it after all , so ... there 's still hope ) . 
  oh , man , that 's hilarious . 
  ~ ~ you should make a separate post about that image , if there is n't one already . ~ ~ scratch that , [ there is a post already !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/49px9o/polish_government_refuses_to_publish/ ), 
  funny enough - before the elections pis first put the motion to have this bill checked by the tribunal , but then , miraculously , [ cancelled it ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/pis-wycofalo-wniosek-do-trybunalu-konstytucyjnego-ws-ustawy-o-tk/et0m4q ) . 
  in the end it was po itself that put a motion to check its own bill . 
  also : only a small part of the whole bill ( last minute amendments ) was deemed unconstitutional ( not that it matters much , but worth a note ) . 
  i do n't know how about you , but for me pis at some point just build this plan to get rid of the constitutional tribunal , cancelled the motion that would be an obstacle in executing it , and proceeded as planned after winning the elections . 
  i think i barely scratched the surface . 
  wish i would find time to make one , huge write-up on this whole topic , cause it 's really super-amusing just how much nonsense and intellectual dishonesty one can muster . 
  i actually watched an online transmission from one day of the 2nd smolensk conference ( i think it was the second one , not sure ) and there 's much more * treasures * in there than just what mainstream media reported . 
   were replaced by two pis judges worth noting : these two judges took part in a tribunal hearing yesterday and verdict today in the case of a bill mentioned in the article ( and both of them were the only judges against the verdict ) . 
  you do realize that targowica was organized to act against the constitution ? 
  that 's exactly what pis is doing . 
  and targowica was made in cooperation with russians - something ( far ) left-wingers are accusing ( certain ) pis politicians of . 
  while i get your message - you used an example that supports exactly the opposite site of the argument you are trying to make . 
   does oswiecim still have a train station by any chance ? 
  [ yep ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:oswiecim_train_station.jpg ) . 
  perhaps it will be a last train you take , but it will be a fancy one !, 
   conspiracy theorists . 
  oh man , you have no clue what you are missing . 
  current minister of defense , mr. macierewicz , organized various conferences trying to prove numerous conspiracy theories related to the 2010 presidential airplane crash . 
  there was so many of them it 's hard to list all of it .
