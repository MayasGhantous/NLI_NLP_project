  from helium bomb , artificial fog , birch-tree planted to crash the plane , to single bomb , a series of bomblets , plane sabotaged by russians , conspiracy of tusk ( current eu president ) with putin , mid-air disintegration , involvement of international bankster cartels , etc. 
  and the proofs they tried to show on these conferences ... man ... diamonds like [ beer ] ( http://r-http-e7.dcs.redcdn.pl/http/o2/tvn/web-content/m/p107/v/674bfc5f6b72706fb769f5e93667bd23/cfbde010-3a76-11e3-a076-0025b511226e/s/005.jpg ) and [ redbull ] ( http://r-scale-59.dcs.redcdn.pl/scale/o2/tvn/web-content/m/p1/i/674bfc5f6b72706fb769f5e93667bd23/7336797e-3a6c-11e3-8a13-0025b511226e.jpg?type=1&amp;srcmode=4&amp;srcx=0/1&amp;srcy=0/1&amp;srcw=640&amp;srch=2000&amp;dstw=640&amp;dsth=2000&amp;quality=80 ) cans simulating airplane structure , '' * tu-154 cracked like a sausage * '' , and much , much more ... 
   if this happens it will be so random i do n't even . 
  not really , there was quite a lot of cancer patients lobbying for that for years ( do n't ask how many of them died ever since that thing started ) . 
  in fact we have ( or is it over ? ), 
  someone on a trial since the last year for trying to bring medical marijuana for his sick father . 
  sentence for doing that ~ ~ is ~ ~ was up to 10 years . 
   to sum it up , i do n't think it will decriminalize weed without actual legislative move to decriminalize weed . 
  it definitely wo n't . 
  you would need a separate bill for that . 
  no no no no , no , not again , not fuckin [ radio station ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ) ( link for those who do n't get the reference ) . 
  of course . 
  though to be fair - he is an older man , with all the family in poland , it 's not as easy for someone ~ 50 years old to move to quatar as it is for people in their 20s or 30s . 
  i 'm not even sure if he accepted the offer . 
  but the sheikh was very open and forthcoming , so i guess he would provide everything that fired director could think of . 
  not the same , but they do have other limits , usually giving power to the corporations over what can or can not be shown on google . 
   earlier today , i read ( in passing ) that pis also fired the people in charge of all state studs and replaced them with party lackeys who have no prior experience in horsebreeding/rearing whatsoever . 
  true . 
  in fact - this fired director of the stable is to be hired by qatar sheikh to take care of his stables . 
   for a people as proud in their horsebreeding tradition and as equine-savy as the polish , this would strike me as exceptionally shortsighted . 
  but , but , but ... everything former government did was evil , and all the people linked to the former government are corrupt agents of the foreign forces !, 
  imho they 'll try to play on time until the us elections , and then hope for the trump ( conveniently missing his pro-russian tendencies , and saying that * he is n't more pro-russian than leftist obama * was ( the [ missile shield ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_missile_defense_complex_in_poland ) debacle ) ) . 
   unless they go full retard and openly support linking poland to russia - and that is a death sentence for any party in poland right wing media are slowly pushing to change that image of russia , pushing towards an image of a great putin leader that cares for his nation , even if it 's against polish interests , one that 's decisive , one that fights for christian europe , one that fights for europe of nations , if you 'll read a bit too much it might look as if they think russia is a lesser evil than the eu . 
  pis already did a pre-emptive strikes devaluing venice commission as much as they could . 
  at the moment it 's an evil organisation conspiring with foreign forces to overthrow polish constitutional order , while pis is basically tying to defend our glorious nation from the enemy . 
  at least that 's what one of the pis supporters keeping up to date with pis * independent * \\* media tried to convince me of . 
  \\* ( or should i call it * defiant * , like they like to call themselves ? ), 
   this is what the eu ruling is asking google to do , pretend that the original data does n't exist in certain circumstances . 
  it 's asking them to hide the result . 
  not `` pretend '' anything . 
   much like how some countries you see - that 's the huge difference - countries hiding content vs individuals hiding content . 
  yes , it does . 
  just like it does for us , canada , australia , japan , south korea or pretty much every other country in the world . 
   asking the middleman to change the results hahaha , good luck with that . 
  but i still admire your optimism . 
  funny enough - so very criticised bing for it 's poor search capabilities offers most of the features you listed . 
  meanwhile suddenly people try to promote duckduckgo as some amazing search engine . 
  i struggle to comprehend all these upvotes to the duckduckgo-club . 
  type in * ariane 5 * . 
  in top-20 results i 'm getting 5 different language versions of wikipedia - en , sco , de , cs and fr . 
  i dare to doubt if [ this ] ( https://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/ariane_5 ) one line of text + an infobox in a flippin scottish is something 99.99 % of people would be looking for . 
  [ edit ] to be fair - if i 'm not signed into bing it gives me 3 odd language versions of wikipedia in top-20 , but at least all of them got quite a bit of content and are on a bottom of the 2nd page , with overall selection of the results being more useful . 
  if duckduckgo would actually be a good search engine - it might be the option . 
  but at the moment even bing gives me better search results . 
  it 's not like either of them is useless , but i really , really do n't need to see the same entry on 6 different language versions of wikipedia , one under another . 
  and that 's barely a tip of an iceberg in terms of the problems that search engine got . 
  lack of virgins as a reward might be a factor ... 
  if they want to decrease the number of generals - they should get rid of these that spent their lives in front of a desk , rarely if ever going out , not these that have a real combat experience from iraq . 
  this is a real loss for our military , no matter how right-wing media try to spin it with an arguments like the one you just used . 
  you underestimate polish engineering . 
  my proud countryman sold an entire metal railway bridge for scrap . 
  volatile explosives are peace a cake . 
   for the ones wondering it 's a farmer trying to explain to polish guest workers that if they see any world war munition when working the field they should stop the tractor , jump off & gtfo . 
  pretty sure they 'd just disarm it and sell it for scrap . 
  wretched but proud . 
  it 's all about politics , really . 
  and last decade we 've seen uk slowly stepping back . 
  cameron 's era was a really huge step back in terms of uk influence over eu . 
  when poland joined eu in a days of tony blair there used to be a trio of powers - uk-fr-de ( blair-chirac-kohl ) - what gave much greater freedom in forming alliances and negotiating . 
  i 'd love to see this balance of powers return back . 
  but it 's not like eu can force uk to become one of a leading states . 
  they need to build partnerships and be active . 
  this whole brexit affair meanwhile makes them more fringe than ever , only accelerating euroscepticism among britons . 
  very few countries want to build up a political alliance with a country that might be negotiating it 's way out of eu in a year or two ( apparently polish mfa is stupid enough to be one of them ) . 
  the end result is self-propelled circle of euroscepticism . 
  you and / u/raio30 might both be right at the same time - airbus wo n't be pulling out , but it also wo n't invest in expansions of its facilities in uk . 
  when brits are opposed of immigration from the eu they mostly think about poland , romania , bulgaria or baltics , not germany  . 
  but other than that you are right . 
  also here is a [ data from 2014 ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/migobs/migrants%20in%20the%20uk-overview.pdf ) : | country | % | | -------------- | ------ | | india | 9.2 % | | poland | 9.1 % | | pakistan | 6 % | | ireland | 4.4 % | | germany | 3.6 % | | south africa | 2.5 % | | nigeria | 2.4 % | | bangladesh | 2.4 % | | romania | 2.2 % | | usa | 2 % |, 
  it is . 
  currently they are hunting for `` communist generals '' and `` corruption that resulted in a bad shape of military '' . 
  meanwhile every military i know of tends to be very , very sceptical of a new defence minister , mr. macierewicz , and so far judged most of his actions very negatively . 
  the back story is that macierewicz is infamous for various conspiracy theories related to the 2010 presidential airplane crash as well as dismantling [ military couter-intelligence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_information_services_%28poland%29 ) in a way that put lifes of informants in danger by publishing the report to public and having it translated to russian . 
  among left-wing circles there 's a strong suspicion that he might be a russian agent - some say it as a joke , some say that judging by his actions - no other explanation makes sense . 
  president lech kaczy\u0144ski that died in that infamous airplane crash is quoted to say in 2007 :  macierewicz does not distinguish between his interpretations and a facts . 
  interesting enough - our prime minister during the elections said that other , much more balanced and reasonable , politician will become a defence minister - mr. gowin . 
  but after a last minute intervention ( behind the scenes known to be made by kaczy\u0144ski ) it was macierewicz that got nomination . 
  also worth noting that they are even more precious because we lost few highly ranked generals with combat experience in 2010 presidential airplane crash . 
  yea , this map is very inaccurate . 
  there are no border controls in most of the places marked by these red lines . 
  poland-germany - not even a police officer near the border . 
  finland-norway - seriously ? 
  who the fuck would go there ? 
  if any migrant from syria reaches that border he should get a scout medal for his survival skills . 
  that would imply they 're going to go commie ... 
  it succeeded in keeping peace over a territories that belong to it . 
  eu is not a world , or even european police . 
  you accuse / u/marzillius of making a massive simplification meanwhile you yourself make one in a first paragraph , only even more inaccurate than his . 
  stop using strawman arguments . 
  you know very well that when he talks about europe he means european union . 
  this shortcut was accepted years ago and is in a common use in press , politics and people , even on this reddit . 
   32 boston whalers for a moment i was like : wtf ?!, 
  whaling ships ?!, 
  on a lake ? 
  show off, 
  ... still it 's a great way for estonia to get into nordic ... no ? 
  also worth noting that this number is not set in stone . 
  certain number of companies would naturally move out from uk to , say , ireland , or ( especially in terms of banking sector ) germany . 
  it 's impossible to say just how many would but it is something to consider . 
  eu would n't loose nearly as much as some people imagine .
