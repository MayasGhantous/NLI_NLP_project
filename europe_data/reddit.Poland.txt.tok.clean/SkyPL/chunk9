  i feel like i missed something , cause eu never tried to crush my national identity . 
  where should i fill in my official complain ? 
  on the same topic : [ serious case review slams police failure in serial abuse of oxford girls [ more than 300 children raped and tortured by `` asian '' gangs , police did nothing ] ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xs0t4/serious_case_review_slams_police_failure_in/ ),

  talk about a right choice of priorities . 
  i actually had a discussion with one russian guy not so long ago and his argument was basically that gulags were just like modern prisons , only prisoners instead of being supported by a country actually work for it . 
  but all of them were convicted criminals and in general it was one of the best prison systems in the world . 
   is 129 pages long . 
  the old version , called the eea2 , was 37 pages long . 
  by comparison , the paper versions of forms for non eea nationals applying as family members under uk domestic immigration rules are a grand total of 35 pages so ... you prefer immigrants from northern africa / middle east / india to the immigrants from eu ? 
  erm ... original point of view ... 
  yea , true : / shit happened . 
  still though - we 've managed to be the only foreign nation to put tsar on russian throne , and at one point we 've been one of the largest * countries * in europe , so that counts for something !, 
   rival - poland so much for [ centuries of cooperation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) :(, 
  sooner or later we will become a colonial empire , and you netherlands are going to be our first colony !, 
   fuck u babylon talk about truly ** historical ** enemy :d, 
  hahahaha , i doubt , 
  not really . 
  [ been there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros%c5%82aw_hermaszewski ) , [ done that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pw-sat ) . 
  o_o of course it 's not . 
  why is that even a question ? 
  i 'd say that the major reason for that is ww2 . 
  for us it was an expedition , we had entire branches of our family trees exterminated , neighbours turning against each other , entire societies collapsing , stuff like that leaves permanent scars , scars that make us see nationalism or anything similar as ... not nearly as positive thing as americans do . 
  we just want state to provide services and fuck off , do n't view it as any subject of celebration . 
  even stuff like celebrating end of ww2 or uprisings or underground movements , is largely about memory of the people that made these heroic efforts , not about the flag , constitution or state . 
  similar with university : provide the service and let us live our lives . 
  wo n't celebrate the institution . 
  even if i made a lot of friends there , some of which i still keep in touch with , and some professors who genuinely were great people ... 
  i still think about them as an individuals , not an institution to celebrate , even if only by buying and wearing t-shirts of . 
  people in question for refugee quotas are already stamped and verified refugees , not some random dudes running across border that hungarian police caught in a middle of the field . 
   in determination of each person 's refugee status validity , it was already determined . 
  you 're not going to get random people . 
  just already verified refugees . 
  at some point they even allowed countries to pick-and-choose them ( eg . 
  based on religion which generally is n't something one should do due to anti-discrimination laws ) - poland still rejected . 
  heck , they [ declined ] ( http://www.rp.pl/uchodzcy/310129903-rzad-zablokowal-pomysl-korytarzy-humanitarnych-dla-uchodzcow.html#ap-1 ) even when polish caritas was planning to bring some refugees on a request of polish episcopate . 
  it 's purely ideological issue . 
  this whole issue with `` verification '' is a bs smoke screen . 
  people this discoussion is about are an actual , verified refugees that firmly fall under the definition of refugee . 
  they 're not going to just randomly pick a boat from mediterranean and haul it to lithuania . 
  do n't play an idiot , please . 
   nominate one minister every three terms . 
  that would be 5 out of 15 years  one ca . 
  every five terms . 
  that would be 5 out of 25 years , with 20 years without any direct representation . 
  sorry , but i find it unlikely anyone on receiving end of this proposal would accept it . 
  if we 'd be there to abandon this principle it has to be replaced with something where nationality does n't matter and fundamentally commission should not be there to give equal representation of states but rather work like a government in national parliaments , simply be a group of ministers with a pm - easy to understand , easy to relate to . 
  that would also mean that they would have to share their legislative power with regular meps , and meps would be the core to fair representation . 
  1 country 1 representative should exist only in the council . 
  another megaproject would be the new coal powerplant in \u0141\u0119czna ( 0.8 mld $ for the construction , almost 0.9 mld $ in the first contract for coal supply , construction will be completed in 2020 ) . 
  there 's also an ongoing construction of additional 2 blocks to the coal powerplant in opole ( [ official website ] ( https://www.blok5i6.pl/ ) ) ( 2.8 mld $ , to be completed in q4 2018-q1 2019 ) future nuclear powerplant ( [ official website ] ( http://pgeej1.pl/en ) ) would also be a megaproject if built ( cost estimates around 9.5 - 14 mld $ ) . 
  for some people and in some languages there 's a clear distinction between patriotism - love to your country - and nationalism - ideology . 
  italy would be a notable example , they even [ threatened ] ( https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/06/14/italy-warns-eu-over-migrant-redistribution-proposal ) others over it long before discussion about any `` sanctions '' begun . 
  they are very adamant about it . 
  unknown , basically . 
  spacex could ring a bell for some , tesla could ring a bell for others , but generally : he is n't known out here , nor people have any reason to care . 
  good post . 
  also : this type of number formatting is called french si style ( spaces as thousands separator , commas as decimal mark ( in english si style it 's dot as a decimal mark ) ) . 
  also worth noting that when we list prices in euro ( eg . 
  in high tourism areas ) we tend to go with 1 299 $ or 1 299,00 $ ( with or without space before euro sign ) . 
   plenty of my friends post political rants on their facebook the only people i have on a facebook that post political rants are british , so i can vouch for that . 
   to answer op 's question - in poland generally it 's not . 
  still some people post * news * stories or random pictures of something they find outrageous , but seeing anyone comment on that is very rare . 
  modern day ? 
  hungary . 
  that said though it all depends in what spheres you move around , eg . 
  for me , work-wise , i have more in common with french or brits working in my industry ( specific subset of it ) than farmers from rural poland ( and it 's not just about work - hobbies , often times political views , etc. 
  etc. , even the way we spend free time ) . 
  historically - lithuania ( [ plc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) ), 
   based on the nationality or ethnicity of a great great grandparent ? 
  so far back it does n't really matter , some countries did not exist back then ( eg . 
  poland was split between 3 countries ) , others had different borders , etc. 
  for some people it 's difficult to even trace their heritage back then . 
  a lot of advantages and disadvantages revolve around ww2/post-ww 2 period . 
  warsaw pact and marshall plan had an enormous impact on europe , but also important in that context were causalities of ww2 , resettlements , losses of property , systemic massacres of best & brightest from some nations ( [ eg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) ) , etc. 
  or at least that 's my perspective as from a country which lost ~ 17 % of its population during ww2 . 
  obviously that impact would be lower in countries with fewer causalities , such as uk for which it was less than 1 % or even less so for switzerland which suffered just ~ 100 individual deaths . 
   while i believe that if your born in the us , your just american citizen , many believe something different it really depends , but mostly revolves around some strong ethnic groups in a state . 
  basques in spain or scotts in uk . 
  it really varies from person to person , but statistically most tends to identify with their country first , minority second . 
  as far as general population goes - i 've seen 2nd generation migrants being perfectly integrated , and while aware of their heritage - feeling citizens of the states they were born in first and foremost . 
  in general migrations between eu states are quite smooth as far as integration goes and 2nd generation generation migrants are already difficult to distinguish from * natives * . 
  imho in europe it 's very different from the us mentality of * we 're americans , but my grand-xx-father was italian or whatnot * . 
  even if someone 's ( grand ) parents were from other european state - it 's not really a topic of any conversation . 
  we just do n't talk about it . 
  identifying oneself with particular region can be more of a topic for conversation than state-related heritage . 
  not having an elected government is a standard across the eu . 
  you vote for parties and/or mps , not who will be the minister of x or the prime minister . 
  btw : in a way it 's amusing that there 's no criticism of that while basically the same happens in the eu ( commission being the government ) and yet it 's regularly bashed for not being directly elected . 
   otherwise we get shit like fucking trump . 
  making it even more amusing by the fact that one of the reasons to have that weird system in place was to avoid trump-like president . 
  these elections were basically a great proof that us electoral college is nothing more than a dead weight . 
  you have to understand that ec presidency is n't really a frontline decision-making job . 
  it 's more of a facilitator and negotiator than anything else . 
  ( [ see also ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/role/ ) ) . 
  but if i 'd be to make some picks : he negotiated a deal between merkel , hollande and tsipras ; supported hungary in their wall-building initiative , closing the case down to angry rhetoric from some politicians , with no negative consequences ; have been pretty much the only strong voice for the security aspect of the migrant crisis , pushing for support of the deal with turkey and handling refugees outside of the eu ; consistently and successfully defended sanctions on russia ; and well , as the prime minister of the netherlands , mark rutte , said :  he 's decent , he 's effective , he 's a very good president given the fact that most of the work he 's doing is behind the scenes - positive feedback from pretty much everyone is probably the best testimony for his actions . 
  worth noting that it 's a matter of french law , and a debate about this particular restriction . 
  law is still in the effect , and french judiciary has a duty to prosecute it , regardless if we agree with said law or not . 
   wroclaw is best example of how you can easly fuck it up huh ? 
  there 's one district with tall skyscrapers , one that used to be there from the days of communism .
