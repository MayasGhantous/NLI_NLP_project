  you cook them first . 
  poles would make a great astronauts for a mars mission . 
  just think of it - us spends years trying to grow lettuce on the iss , and that 's barely a beginning . 
  for poles you can just dehydrate potatoes , bread , pack it with a few cans of beer and you 're done .

   poles with historically significant german influence ( silesians ) . 
  silesians you think about are in upper silesia , province in question is located a lower silesia , with little to no * german influence * ( [ related read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_population_transfers_%281944%e2%80%9346%29 ) ) .

  quick google search : [ number of guns in uk at record high as almost 2 million firearms are now licensed ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/number-guns-uk-record-high-6509872 ), 
  interesting . 
  in poland most of the people having guns are either hunters or own them for self-defence . 
  '' * getting rid of the fucking boars * '' is not a valid reason to get a gun permit - if you want to do that call to the [ state forests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_forests_%28poland%29 ) , they 'll send someone in to decide whether to shoot the animal or attempt relocating ( usually it 's * shoot * , but at least you 'll have professional doing it with a single shot instead of some amateur * doing his best * ) .

  more like poor man 's club . 
  you 're not missing anything , guys . 
  not to mention that v4 is still pretty much meaningless , even despite of attempts from new polish government to resurrect it 's dead body . 
  still nothing useful is being done through v4 , it might change , but there 's only as much as one can do . 
  i ca n't and i do n't . 
  as i said - what is needed is an assist and expansion . 
  we very much agree here . 
  i just do n't think that giving up your border control would achieve the goal . 
  if eu member states want to - they can extend frontex competences and rise it in a numbers - something that in my opinion would be far less intrusive than what hungary expects from greece . 
  though as far as i 'm aware there 's quite a lot of [ opposition to that , even in hungary ] ( https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/12/17/eupl-d17.html ) :  `` the italian interior ministry is very unhappy about having outsiders on italy 's borders , '' a senior diplomat in brussels told the british guardian newspaper . 
  `` there are too many sovereign sensitivities . ''   protests from warsaw and budapest were even more explicit . 
  polish foreign minister witold waszcykowski rejected the commission 's plans on the radio station rmf , saying they would create an organisation that could arbitrarily make decisions about member states without giving them any voice in the process . 
  the border troops have no democratic legitimacy , he insisted . 
  foreign minister peter szijjarto made similar complaints and insisted that border control must remain a component of national sovereignty . 
  so ... border control must remain a component of hungarian national sovereignty but not greek ? 
  if my [ longer explenation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45vqo7/visegrad_group_opposes_germanys_refugee_policy/d00kdv7?context=3 ) did not cut it , than i hope that by now you see that they do n't have as good intentions as you , and few other posters around here , try to picture . 
   included persuading greece to hand over the defence of its frontier to the remaining 27 member states volunteer troops patrolling the union 's outer border oh ... no wonder everyone voted against it . 
  what 's needed is an assist and expansion , not completely giving up current border control to the eu volunteer force , even organizing that would take months , not to mention little to no real benefits it could bring . 
  beautiful fortress . 
  looks really great .

  few facts : * macedonia have been building a border fence on it 's own [ for a while now ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/european-refugee-crisis-macedonia-builds-10-foot-high-razor-topped-fence-along-greek-border-1537078 ) ( [ 2 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34954858 ) ) * poland has been [ helping ] ( http://www.defence24.pl/266575,polski-smiglowiec-wspiera-ochrone-granicy-wegier-ponad-300-tys-imigrantow ) to secure eu borders since late 2015 , before the new government stepped in . 
  * degree of support to be provided by v4 is unknown and unlikely to be significant - most likely it 'll be populist move used for domestic politics '' * how good our government is comparing to the bad , hopeless western europe * '' - as pointed out above , macedonia already did most of the work . 
  * '' * she was forcing others to pay for it * '' - it was n't merkel , but rather majority of the eu member states . 
  i know it 's not comfortable for a current political agenda of a right-wing parties across the eu , but it 's not just merkel that wants redistribution of immigrants or financial support for the regions affected by crisis . 
  * '' * right-wing hungarian prime minister viktor orban urged macedonia and greece to follow his example and fence off their borders against refugees . 
  * '' - greece has a huge problem with islands , most notably lesbos , which is [ here ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/lesbos,+greece/@38.8727244,25.3580988,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x14af8516edc7f755:0x8627d601b32663e7 ) . 
  building fence * around an island * is a nonsense , not to mention that greek coastline is roughly 14 000 km , [ lesbos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lesbos ) coastline alone is 320 km , comparing to 175 km [ fence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_border_barrier ) build by hungary . 
  * '' * unlike macedonia , greece was not invited to the visegerad meeting in prague . 
  athens fears that macedonia might close its border soon , leaving thousands of refugees in greece . 
  * '' - problems of greece are absent from political discussion in these four countries because they do n't serve their political agenda . 
  if they 'd actually want to help solving migrant crisis - greece should be near the very top of their priorities . 
  we blob like crazy , but then everything goes down to shit , mostly due to our own fault , though shitty spawn point can be blamed too . 
  this '' * beating shit out of spaniards * '' is not a joke , i see ... look at the number of people killed ... jeez , you guys went full on berserker . 
  danzig is a polish city - [ gda\u0144sk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gda%c5%84sk ) . 
  as for kalingrad , well , it 's basically a military base , with rather poor population , though it 's still one of the best-performing regions in russia economy-wise . 
  poland has a special non-visa agreement for kaliningrad oblast , and they have a special economic zones there , boosting commerce . 
  local population is rather friendly and due to constant contacts with the eu citizens - they tend to be less pro-putin 's - russia than other regions are ( [ apperently ] ( http://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportid=14351 ) in 2012 presidential elections putin got only 52 % there , the lowest result of all regions in russia ) . 
  military-wise they have a nukes there * constantly aimed at poland * , which they remind us about every time they do n't like what nato is doing ( they say that they deployed [ iskanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k720_iskander ) with nukes aimed at poland - it 's so common that `` iskander '' is a name of a missile that pretty much every pole knows ) . 
  other mean of annoying poles with kaliningrad is by blocking pass through the [ vistula spit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vistula_spit ) - poland does n't have one , the only available is in russia . 
  also back in '90s kaliningrad used to be a source of constant border infringement incidents , including attack helicopters flying dozens of kilometres into polish airspace , even after we joined nato . 
  they calmed down when we bought f-16s . 
  and luckily enough - it 's such a small territory , that needed be - we can level it to the ground with artillery ( which is something our military [ reminded ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zgxcr/poland_conducts_military_exercises_near_ukrainian/ ) them during the war in ukraine ) . 
  currently they 're building a [ nuclear powerplant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad_nuclear_power_plant ) there , fly planes back and forth between petersburg and kaliningrad , occasionally some submarines or warships . 
  in general it 's a source of constant annoyance . 
  as for having polish or german influence - not really . 
  does n't * feel * so . 
  some of the buildings have german architecture , but other than that - it feels like russia . 
  at least that 's my opinion , others might disagree . 
   soviet occupaion - well bulgaria , gdr , even mongolia were also difference is that soviet occupation is the only thing we have in common with mongols ( well , other than some [ mongol invasions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:campaignbox_mongol_invasion_of_poland ) ) , on the other hand - it 's one of many things that we share with hungarians . 
   you don \u00b4 t share borders , cause you stand on our way , slovakia !, 
   read the article i linked about a [ first vienna award ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_vienna_award ) - one of the root causes behind it was that poland and hungary wanted to restore a common border . 
   for you - poland i think closer should be belarus , ukraine - for historical resons - their western areas were poland - even polish minorities - kresy , lithuania also - but linguistic similarities are logically not present here , but wilno was polish city for centuries ... i mean each of this countries based on those aspects i mentioned should be far closer than hungary if you want to say this is our , , brother nation , , yes , i even have a distant family in ukraine ( [ damn russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recovered_territories ) ) , but none the less - noone really views them as a brother-nation in poland . 
  linguistically we 're more similar to czechs and slovaks - your languages i can understand , at least to a degree . 
  in terms of shared history obviously lithuania would be the closest , but they do n't like us , and ... well ... are too small to matter . 
  whatever relations existed in a past were mostly severed somewhere after [ partitioning of poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) . 
  cultural similarity - well , that we share with pretty much everyone with whom we shared border over the history , i have n't been to belarus and russia , but other than that - i have n't noticed that any neighbor would be more similar to us than other ; sure , we 're less similar to germans ( the further away from the border the less similar they are ) , and even less so with turkey ( almost always at war ) or sweden ( rival empire , [ deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29 ) , again : almost no period of friendly relations ) , but that 's about it . 
   if you and hungarians see each other as brother nations o.k , if you do recognize that , than it should pretty much end the discussion , should n't it ? 
  cause that 's what counts most , imho, 
   no - only limited under some monarchs looong time ago . 
  well , there 's [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_vienna_award ) , and a years of soviet occupation , obviously . 
  that 's very recent history . 
  plus : apparently our new government wants to make a * budapest in warsaw * , so there 's that too ... kind of a new era in our special relationship ... this time french-kissing among right-wingers . 
   but their relationship lacks some aspects from mentioned czech/slovakia there are very very few nations that have the aspects you two share . 
  it 's quite amazing just how close your nations are , it 's kind of like ... you know how bacteria splits in two to reproduce ? 
  it 's almost the same , only somehow sloviakia ended up being smaller , 
  hole see ? 
  oh , sure , still i added a little bit of detail in , 
  to poland it 's hungary . 
  there 's even a related proverb - [ pole and hungarian cousins be ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) . 
  23 march is a day of polish-hungarian/hungarian-polish friendship . 
  elisa will detect different frequencies than land-based detectors . 
  it 's not really about sensitivity , it 's about being able to * hear * things beyond the grasp of land-based detectors . 
  while the first discovery was made in us-based detectors - europe is on a very forefront of the gravitational wave science . 
  apperently rosi\u0144ska , jaranowski , kr\u00f3lak , belczynski , bulik , bejger , kowalska , rosi\u0144ska and zadro\u017cny are in deed on the authors list ^ { [ pg .11 ] ( http://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/physrevlett.116.061102 ) ^ down } . 
  glad to see that at least individual scientists made it . 
  amusing how you complain about all previous governments while a current one has some of the most socialist polices since the death of communism . 
   we are extremly poor in comparison to wealth west , north and south of europe no , we 're not * extremely * poor . 
  go abroad one day , or something ? 
  visit ukraine , or kosovo ? 
  or better yet : visit some of the african countries , away from tourist routes . 
  there you might redefine your meaning of `` extremely poor '' . 
  even flippin university of the balearic islands is in . 
  poland as always - desert of science .
