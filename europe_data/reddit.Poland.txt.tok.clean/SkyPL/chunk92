   there is 0 evidence of any wrong doing by them . 
  false . 
  they did not have a valid papers , they did not follow procedures . 
  what there is no evidence for is whether swapping them with controllers having valid papers and following procedures would prevent the disaster . 
   your pilot fucked up , he did n't listen to warnings made by both russian atc and by instruments on board . 
  he did . 
  in fact : he did n't even have a valid papers to be on that flight in a first place !, 
   and possibly managed to bend some facts to hide any neglect on their side . 
  i doubt there 's much they could hide considering that the results of polish investigation were that their ground controllers had no valid papers to control the flight and did not follow the icao procedures . 
  basically : these people should n't even be in a control tower - russians run out of things to `` hide '' on a very fundamental grounds when it comes to the disaster itself ( there was much more after it , i would n't be surprised if a lot of it would be in deed hidden , but that 's a separate topic ) . 
  bad luck ( fog ) , incompetence ( from people preparing flight , through pilots , down to ground controllers ) , not following procedures ( by both : pilots and ground controllers ) , not following computer warnings , pilots without valid papers to take that flight , controllers without valid papers to perform their duty , and so on , and so on ... 
  at the moment it serves purely political purpose . 
  to make sure poles are fighting with each other over some useless piece of metal . 
  we had investigators on a crash site from day 1 , there 's no revelation this wreck could bring if brought back to poland , especially now when it 's basically a rusted scrap metal . 
  i see no reason to discriminate european prison camps . 
  worth mentioning that all profits from that cd went to support victims of the great flood . 
  this song is kind of like '' * all-star game * '' , with all the greatest artists of that era uniting . 
  there was a huge national effort to help people affected and some amazing examples of solidarity between people , a pessimist in me thinks that something like that would n't be possible right now , with country so very much more divided than it used to be ... btw : the video you linked to has an english subtitles , but is cut out near the end , [ here is a full version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5hooj3qkm4 ) though no english subs . 
  i read that as `` when the word got out about ** millennium falcon ** in poland '' , saw the image of cars on a hill , first thought : people were trying to get a high ground , spotting millennium falcon fly-by . 
  very good speech . 
  i wish more leaders of the eu member states , including my own , would have such a realistic assessment of the situation . 
  great example with the issues startups face - financing them is a huge problem in eu , it 's far , far worse than in the us . 
  free movement of data is a huge challenge - i wish it 'd become a reality , but that would require a huge changes to licensing models and copyright across the eu . 
  btw : he really is such an ... * it-aware * person as he appears in this speech ? 
  i 'm even more impressed . 
   if we cede to the populists who say that europe can not be trusted with its citizens ' interests , ladies and gentlemen , then no crisis , foreseeable or not , will find an adequate solution . 
  be they migration , the euro or even military aggression , not to mention the challenge of technological change , solutions that revert to the nation state will bring us back to a pre-world war ii era . 
  an era where short-termism , beggaring-thy-neighbour , leads inevitably to a tit-for-tat and a loss for all . 
  back to an era where , once again , might makes right . 
  where that leads we have seen too many times in europe 's history . 
   let us hold no illusions of what faces us if we hesitate or stumble , if -- to quote yeats again from the same poem , \u02bb * the best lack all conviction , while the worst / are full of passionate intensity * \u02bc . 
   the choice is ours . 
  and a well-deserved standing ovation . 
   i mentioned this elsewhere in the thread , but i 'd assume solar would reduce co \u2082 production elsewhere and have other benefits in addition to the impact it has on reflected light , so that one is n't as simple . 
  but trees also reduce co2 ... and trees , unlike solar panels , do not require any production ( there are no resources mined , processed , transported thousands of kilometers , etc. 
  ) , so you reduce co2 production as well   as to the painting rooftops white , that does seem to be a good idea , whether its better than green roofs , i do n't know , i 'd have assume not until reading this , now i 'm less sure !, 
  i would guess that everything with higher [ albedo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albedo ) would be beneficial . 
  so in theory you should use that [ colored asphalt ] ( http://www.asphaltcolor.com/ ) thing for roads - even making it dark red instead of usual black could make a difference ( though someone should calculate an impact of coloring asphalt vs benefit from the reflected light ), 
  it wo n't be an aid . 
  equipment will be stored in warehouses , host country wo n't have any right to use it , even in case of war , unless a separate permit would be granted . 
  so ... instead of planting trees we should all paint our roofs white / use shiny steel roofing , and preferably : do the same to roads ? 
  and if it 's really as bad as study implies for trees - would n't it be even worse for solar panels , which tend to be either black , or very dark blue - in a result contributing to the global warming instead of reducing it ? 
  the deal they offered is that a first batch will be loaned from france , as production boosts up - french helicopters will be returned back and replaced with these made in poland . 
  how ? 
  we 'd have to create a new helicopter manufacturer from ground up . 
  that 's not possible - we need helicopters in 2018 , not 2118 . 
  even if we 'd assume a cooperation with ukrainians - the only companies that could provide what they wanted were sold to agustawestland and sikorsky , neither of which has any will to cooperate with them . 
  he is . 
  he says whatever suits the political agenda of his party , not what got anything to deal with facts on this tender . 
  do n't believe a word of what mr. waszczykowski , macierewicz or kownacki say about this tender . 
  they play a political game here , nothing more . 
  any helicopter selected would be mostly manufactured abroad . 
  to simplify : sikorsky and agustawestland pretty much only build hulls and run an assembly lines . 
  airbus offered very similar deal , only by placing this assembly in a hands of polish company - wzl \u0141\u00f3d\u017a - and topping the cake with engines production in poland by turbomeca , something no other offerent did . 
  not only them . 
  turbomeca offered expanding production capability to manufacture makila 2 engines in poland for polish caracals . 
  this combined with what airbus put on table was a far better offer than anything aw or s/lm offered . 
  i agree with most of what you say , but situation is far more complicated than it seems . 
  while everyone agree that the change in eu is needed - everyone want to pull it in a different direction , making any departure from current * status quo * very , very difficult . 
  let me point out a few things from your post :  it needs to be democratised and streamlined . 
  member states oppose it . 
  the current form was worked out as a very complicated political compromise . 
  it 's unlikely to be revised without significant change in politics of the member states . 
  eu parliament was asking several times for further democratisation of the eu , most notably before junker 's commission came to be , but it gained no significant support from the national leaders . 
  as for streamlining the eu ... major problem is that every person asked has a different opinion on just how streamlined it should be and which areas should be a priority . 
  doing that would require a new treaty - something that few countries oppose , as expressed by junker soon after he took the office . 
  apparently there 's some hope for that in 2020s , but a lot depends on council of the european union ( aka . 
  leaders of the member states ) . 
   schengen needs to be reworked to that external borders are actually protected . 
  again : member states oppose it . 
  the most common argument is that eu stepping in would infringe sovereignty , while `` frontier '' countries themselves are clearly incapable of securing borders themselves . 
  not to mention that in case of greece or italy it 's extremely problematic in a first place due to all the islands they have near non-schengen countries . 
   the critical flaws in the eurozone need to be addressed . 
  again - member states oppose any proposed plans that would address glaring issues . 
  so far noone came up with any suggestion that would be supported by majority , not to say : all of the eurozone members . 
   useless policies like cap need to be reformed . 
  common agricultural policy is not useless . 
  tl ; dr : they are unhappy , uk gets too much , eu and other member states will pay dearly for this agreement . 
  seeing that both sides are unhappy - it seems that the real compromise was reached . 
  also worth a note :  q. 5 . 
  what is your period of study ? 
    for the 2016 index , most data covers the ** second half of 2014 through the first half of 2015 ** . 
  to the extent possible , the information considered for each factor was current as of june 30 , 2015 . 
  it is important to understand that some factors are based on historical information . 
  for example , the monetary policy factor is a 3-year weighted average rate of inflation from january 1 , 2012 , to december 31 , 2014 . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.heritage.org/index/about ) ), 
  if you 'd want both than you 'd most likely still have to live by eu laws , only this time without having a say in them , and still pay to eu budget , only this time not getting any direct benefits from them . 
  kind of like norway . 
  the current state of things is a result of compromises , agreements and what member states are willing to do . 
  so far they are n't even willing to fulfil the commitments on a relocation of migrants and block all proposed ideas for increasing capabilities of frontex to help countries secure their borders . 
  eu can not decide to dissolve because a results of that would be catastrophic for the economy - no matter what one might think about current situation on a subject of migrants and eurozone - eu is enormously beneficial for the european economy , and getting rid of that would most likely end up with crisis bigger than any in last 25 years . 
  that said - saying that '' * united states manages this sort of immigration all the time * '' is kind of laughable , cause , really : they do n't . 
  they 're just lucky enough that migrants disperse around a country and integrate far better in a population than migrants in the eu do - mostly because of much lower cultural and religious differences . 
  you 're annexing it even after it 's long gone . 
  that 's really saying something ... 
  quick quote from / u/emnel :  that being said , notion that poland and germany are some kind of eternal enemies is simply a misconception . 
  both countries lived in almost symbiotic relationship for better part of the millennium . 
  ( ... )  there was holy roman empire as a whole . 
  teutons and brandenburg were pretty meaningless in grand scheme of things and the latter was fighting more against other german states anyway . 
   but even if we were to consider teutons representatives of all the germans , there was n't a single polish-german war between 1520 and 1794 ( or 1772 , if we are speaking about facts ) .
