  i 'd say that 's pretty amazing for this part of european history . 
   and if we were to look for a serious war that actually involved sizable part of hre we would probably have to look as far back as 1332 . 
  that 's 440 years of peace on polish-german border without it being moved for even an inch . 
  440 years of thriving trade , migrations , cultural and intellectual exchange . 
  [ was germany 's nazi party an extreme left or right wing party ?

  hope that clarifies it !, 
  if not - feel free to ask historians for additional clarifications , there 's plenty of people willing to help you out and provide additional argumentation . 
  i seen that grid like 3 times already after mentioning that nazis were far-right . 
  people really think a 2 axis grid is an argument ? 
  in a book , dude . 
  in a book . 
  paper stuff , though these days you can buy e-books too , if you 'd like . 
  i 'm off here , you are clearly trolling .

  and as i said - it 's an argument being made , dismissing truth just because you do n't like it wo n't get you far . 
  there 's quite a good argument made [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk:nazi_party ) ( frequently asked questions ) with some additional sources in the [ article references & notes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_party#notes ) . 
  { edit : } additionally you can read rather extensive topic in [ ask historians ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2sybie/was_germanys_nazi_party_an_extreme_left_or_right/ ) where people far more qualified than i am will explain you why nazis were far-right . 
   tl , dr : hitler was extreme right ; no , his intervention in the economy and his dealings with stalin do n't magically turn him into a left-wing though i 'm always amused that far-right defenders are here every time someone mentions nazis are far-right . 
  national socialists are far right too , even tough they supported a lot of socialist polices . 
  fyi : in europe economically liberal parties tend to be centrist ( eg . 
  [ alde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe ) ) . 
  there are some rare exceptions ( [ korwin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_for_the_renewal_of_the_republic_-_liberty_and_hope ) ) but overall trend is that the further away from center you go - regardless in which direction - the more likely you are to encounter parties with socialist polices .

  [ oath of citizenship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oath_of_citizenship ) . 
  not in all countries , but it is a thing . 
   no , you could not apply for assylum in germany . 
  ( ... ) how can one get assylum in germany prior to 2014 ? 
  ( ... ) if you 're poor , pretty fucking hard [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/networks/european_migration_network/reports/docs/migration-statistics/asylum-migration/2009/05a._germany_annual_report_on_migration_and_international_protection_statistics_2009_final_version_1_en.pdf ) page 33 year | total number of applications | : -- | : -- | 1995 | 166,951 | 1996 | 149,193 | 1997 | 151,700 | 1998 | 143,429 | 1999 | 138,319 | 2000 | 117,648 | 2001 | 118,306 | ... | ... | 2009 | 33,035 | in 2009 main countries of origin for asylum seekers were iraq , afghanistan , turkey , kosovo , iran . 
  all obviously known for their large populations of strikingly rich people that went through all the checks no problem . 
  as for specific laws - sorry , to find them i would need to speak german , but one of the ways is to make a written request and send it to the foreigners office , or one better known : on the airport ( flights from wherever in northen africa to germany ca n't be much more expensive than few hundred dollars they take for smuggling through mediterranean ( apparently it 's [ $ 400 - $ 1500 ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/mediterranean-migrant-smugglers-100-life-jacket-human-trade-misery-africa-middle-east-1496598 ) , but some people pay even [ $ 7000 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/24/libyas-people-smugglers-how-will-they-catch-us-theyll-soon-move-on ) for smuggling all the way from eritrea ) . 
  wait 10-15 years and people will forget about it , fighting between each other instead . 
   prior to 2014 , there was no `` legal '' way to immigrate to germany for many people not from developed countryies , same for assylum . 
  that 's a total nonsense . 
  no idea how did you came up with that . 
  on both fronts : legal immigration and asylum . 
   this is understandable , but not ethical . 
  the life of a poor person is worth as much as the life of a rich person . 
  both deserve a decent life . 
  if your life was in danger you could apply for asylum . 
  we 're talking here about regular migrants . 
  as for decent life - you can have a decent life in almost every country in the world outside of germany ( countries with active conflicts obviously being an exception - but that 's where asylum rights step in ) . 
  it 's not just germany with green grass and nuclear wasteland everywhere around . 
   the whole concept - which is failing - is that countries on the outside of the eu get eu funding to enforce border protection . 
  the whole concept was and still is decent , it 's the execution that failed . 
  funding was n't adjusted to the number of people attempting to cross the border and currently several countries are blocking any attempts of increasing eu support through frontex ( countries can not provide enough manpower to handle the waves , so external support is required , but that 's being blocked because `` sovereignty '' ) . 
  as someone who had a taste of before-schengen days : yes , it 's fucking annoying to stand 2 + hours on a border crossing , and hear a radio updates telling you how many hours you 'll have to wait ( 24 + for trucks was n't anything usual ) . 
   because he 's rich . 
  because he followed all the procedures required to legally move to another country . 
  let 's not pretend that doing stuff legally is such a horrible obscurity only rich people can do it . 
  same with obtaining citizenship - you can get it like thousands of other people do , by passing exams and taking an oath , though it 's not required to migrate to another country . 
  elective monarchy . 
  we tried that . 
  had some highlights , but mostly was shit . 
  closest to that in modern world would be oligarchy pushing their own presidents in a states with presidential system . 
  alternative view on that would be a technocracy - but we already know the opposition to that idea . 
  it 'd end up being a contest of popularity and influence . 
  so ... oligarchy , that other poster already mentioned . 
  [ mildly related , but fun ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/politicaldiscussion/comments/3uccnz/kasich_bush_and_rubio_say_that_trump_is_a_fascist/cxdojyv ) . 
   all the muslims are imported to drive wages down and to further fuck over the already marginalized working class . 
  that 's not why ( for example ) sweden allowed so many refugees in . 
  they did it out of humanitarian reasons . 
  end result was n't what they expected , but none the less - the reasoning behind it was very much in line of social interventionism beyond their own borders . 
  quite normal for a social democracy . 
  in fact the refugee convention itself has a roots in that , as a response for ww2 cruelties started by nationalism . 
  it 's still a nordic social democracy , not nordic national socialism . 
   the very reason why they got flooded with migrants is because of their open polices , contradicting nationalistic ideology - which led to raise of nationalistic parties . 
  he eats them for dinner . 
  ever heard that stalin has a lights turned on for a whole night ? 
  wondered why ? 
  there it is . 
  do n't fill your posts with bolds and enormous fonts . 
  it does n't make you look any smarter , quite the contrary . 
  nsdap was a far-right party , not a left-wing . 
  there 's more than enough sources for that but let me link you to a [ random one ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=9a9mrnxtdjgc&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+nazi+party+1919-1945:+a+complete+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=mommuriafumn7aawiidwbg&amp;ved=0cdiq6aewaa#v=snippet&amp;q=far%20right&amp;f=false ) . 
  why they are `` national socialists '' is because their polices had multiple socialist points . 
  which is n't anything unusual for right-wing parties . 
  in europe economically liberal parties are centrist or center-left / center-right , very rarely right/far-right . 
  social democracy is currently most popular kind of socialism that is n't national - the most developed countries in the world ( by hdi ) are following it - in scandinavia . 
  national socialism is a very specific kind of socialism , nearly died out after ww2 . 
  i doubt most of 18-20 y.o. 
  girls would be able to use a knife on an attacker with any degree of success . 
  it 'd more likely end up as a weapon of an attacker . 
  pepper spray on the other hand works fine - you do n't need a physical contact between weapon and attacker , which is a huge advantage . 
  because new right is not like the * old right * parties - national conservatives , they are more like a national socialists . 
  knives are notoriously abused . 
  pepper sprays ? 
  sometimes used in robberies , but not a huge problem imho , in that case a self-defence value triumphs losses made in attacks using them . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pepper_spray#europe ) is the article about legality of pepper sprays in europe . 
  yes , it did . 
  but tl ; dr : mr. macierewicz , current minister of defense , decided that airbus can not win this tender before his party even won the elections , and ever since he 's been put into the office - he was making a moves to get rid of them while still trying not to look like an utter idiot , which is what would happen if he 'd just scrap the offer . 
  he finds various excuses for why airbus is a ` worse ' offer . 
  you must understand that this tender was heavily politicized in poland by law and justice , current governing party .
