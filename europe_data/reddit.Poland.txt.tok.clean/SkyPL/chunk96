   i think we should go back to an extended eec . 
  eec was already a political union with parliament , commission and few other things that the eu opponents dislike so much . 
  [ edit ] seeing downvotes i guess i should provide source . 
  here : [ treaty establishing the european economic community and related instruments ( eec treaty ) contents ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:11957e ), 
  czechs , hungarians , slovaks can complain , sure , but poles should shut up . 
  our democratically elected government agreed and supported quotas for the refugees . 
  we have absolutely no reason to say that eu `` imposed '' anything on us . 
   no artists or programmers were killed you baffoon what did i just read ? 
  now imagine this postman ( russia ) is a known criminal and a rapist who observes your yard 24/7 and steps in and out whenever he feels like it . 
  you warned him many times , but he keeps on doing what he does . 
  you 're afraid of your family ( citizens ) - would ' t you use force to make him stay away ? 
  ( to keep the analogy - it 'd be only hurting him , not killing , as russia as such is clearly alive and well ), 
  greece is allied with turkey through nato . 
  russia is directly hostile towards nato . 
  there is no war on a border between greece and turkey , there is one in syria . 
  you still ca n't see the difference ? 
  it 's actually the other way around . 
  initial offer from sweden were far better for polish industry than german . 
  french also offered better conditions than germans . 
  obviously though offers might change now that the new government is `` reviewing '' everything ... 
  poland does n't suck completely !, 
  deal with it , british media !, 
  it 's much more complicated . 
  no matter who wins - we wo n't be buying them off-the-shelf , but rather try to include polish companies in a production . 
  problems with the last two 212s do n't really matter from polish perspective . 
  nor the fact that mesma is unproven - military is clearly more than open for unproven designs , seeing that they invited a26 . 
  in the end though politics will also play a major role in decision-making process , what might put a26 in a significant advantage ( knowing the anti-german attitude of the new government and particular ... lack of friendliness towards france ) . 
  and delaying the procurement is not really an option , it 's already a delayed programme . 
  apparently people who seen the spectacle say that it 's a really good one , and all the fears about sex and pornography were grossly overblown . 
  then there 's a commercial success - but that would come even if the spectacle would be an utter shit , simply thanks to the enormous advertisement made by the governing party and it 's supporters . 
  been `` enjoying '' it ever since they announced a list of ministers . 
  situation in a country is getting more and more crazy every week . 
  i doubt they can keep up this speed , cause if they would - poland would be consumed by the black hole in little less than a 4 years . 
  you know that something is off when you start numbering your boats u-3529 , 
  germans know how to build ubots . 
  out of all the subs currently procured by poland - german type 212 is an absolute favorite of our navy guys . 
  obviously that 's not enough to win the procurement , but says something positive about the way germans build them , 
  and we wo n't as much buy them as the winner of a procurement will be decided , contract will be signed in 2017 , 3 subs are to be ordered , first two till 2022 , third in 2023 . 
  random fun fact : poland wants to arm them with cruise missiles ( think : [ tomahawks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomahawk_%28missile%29 ) , though there are different offers , eg . 
  french want to sell a package of scorp\u00e8ne + [ mdcn-ncm ] ( http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/focus-analysis/naval-technology/2042-mbdas-naval-cruise-missile-production-started-and-program-is-progressing-well.html ) ) . 
  same here . 
  sure , guy was probably risking his life for that joke , but hey - i laughed . 
  only demilitarized , [ read here ] ( http://www.mortarinvestments.eu/information/constructions/demilitarisation ) . 
  you can buy small arms in a working condition if you have a permit , but not from this store , and forget about shooting 152mm dana artillery piece . 
   but being an `` informal requirement '' means nothing though , it has to be official for it to carry any weight whatsoever . 
  what matters is if people know it , and that 's where globalisation is heading , whether you like it or not . 
  eu does n't have to lift a finger . 
  it 's bound to happen , just a matter of time . 
  actually , on a second thought : involving eu into that might only have a negative effect , people would see it as a ussr-style russification and try to oppose it , probably slowing down the inevitable . 
  too much interventionism can be worse than too little . 
  changes like that can only happen naturally , and they should happen naturally . 
  there 's no reason to impose anything . 
  at the end of a day - knowing english will be an informal requirement for anyone well educated , just like knowing the basics of maths is . 
  english is moving into everyday life more and more as years pass . 
  yes , native languages will prevail for much more than one generation , they might just as well never die , but knowing english will become de facto a necessity . 
  as far as military goes - english is already a lingua franca in nato . 
  that ship has sailed . 
  every nato officer knows english , and professional soldiers tend to know it as well . 
  heck - nato is even paying for an english courses to the retired staff , so they could share their knowledge more easily if needed . 
  obviously he had once since he did not annex poland . 
  english is becoming lingua franca anyway - simply due to globalisation . 
  no need to establish anything , just wait one generation , it will happen . 
  i for one would much rather have this money spend on few * normal * cities re-build in syria - cause if for that kind of money you can build that kind of thing in uae - you surely can build bigger / more regular cities in a ruined syria , by the way also helping to spin the local economy . 
  `` the telescope of devastation '' - let me guess - americans build that one ? 
  yes , the war budgets are ridiculous if put in a perspective . 
  [ air conditioning the military costs more than nasa 's entire budget ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/air-conditioning-military-cost-nasa_n_881828.html ) - that $ 20.2 billion per year is on the same level as the sum in the topic of this article . 
  to put it in a perspective : * [ masdar city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/masdar_city ) will cost roughly $ 20.5 billion - an entire city that 's sustainable , zero-carbon , zero-waste ecology and car free . 
  * that 's over 4 years of the entire european space agency budget . 
  * [ iter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iter ) , an international fusion research reactor , currently costs $ 13 billion , but the development is still underway ( till 2019 ) . 
  if successful - it will open a doors to the nearly infinite source of a free , clean energy with a new reactors to follow . 
  * [ overwhelmingly large telescope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overwhelmingly_large_telescope ) was cancelled , because it 's cost - $ 1.5 billion - was deemed too high, 
  still imho the most amusing story of how croissants came to be is that one :  according to other sources in vienna , in 1683 to celebrate the defeat of the ottomans by christian forces in the siege of the city , as a reference to the crescents on the ottoman flags , when bakers staying up all night heard the tunneling operation and gave the alarm . 
  this has led to croissants being banned by some islamic fundamentalists . 
  ( after [ wikipedia article on the thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croissant#origin_stories ) ), 
  ca n't find it , but [ i found this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1dugd3/literal_translations_of_chinese_names_for/ ), 
  i did a quick google search and here 's a list i got : guys : horny ( especially towards blones ) , girls : fat , everyone : loud ( communicating with shout ) , lazy ( even if they * work * , no work is being done ) , spending their whole lives with family ( mammy 's son ) , uneducated , arrogant , their diet is made of pasta and italian wine . 
  renews ? 
  they never stopped . 
  even more so considering that the stereotype of italians in poland did not change at all ... 
  imho the best looking landscapes in this thread . 
  truly beautiful and varied . 
  [ refinery , pioneering modern oil industry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignacy_%c5%81ukasiewicz ), 
   though using word '' \u017byd '' as an insult and graffiti with stars of david are quite common . 
  are they ? 
  i ca n't recall seeing any graffiti of that sorts in last few years . 
  as for using `` jew '' as an insult - it 's pretty much limited to the primary school , polish is a very rich language when it comes to insults , but i do n't recall anyone adult using `` jew '' as an insult since ... 90s ? 
  all this stuff used to be a thing in '90s . 
  pretty much died out by now . 
  at least where i live/go , though i guess there are some regions / kinds of people in poland where it still survived . 
   is that a satyrical channel ? 
  it 's a far-right-wing nutjob . 
  as relevant as any other similar idiot . 
  some people watch him cause he is above average in manipulating facts . 
  my attempts of ordering a tea tend to say something different . 
  russian , german , ~ ~ even ~ ~ polish are easier to use in prague than english . 
  uaz . 
  no false hopes . 
  random post : now that you mention language-related stuff - surprisingly few people in prague speak english . 
  heck , in a burger king on a prague main bus terminal , out of the entire crew only some pimpled cook knew english . 
   also none migrant would like to reach the mountain to go to poland/slovakia .
