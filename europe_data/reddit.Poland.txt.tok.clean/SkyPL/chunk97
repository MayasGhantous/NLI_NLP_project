  it 's very likely true . 
  still though - in reality you can cross high mountains in half a day , on foot . 
  there are also buses going back and forth , with no passport control it 's enough you got money for tickets . 
  in general it 's less of a problem than many people make it to be . 
  park a caravan inside and there we go - a house !, 
  in a worst case - you could make it a hideout , much like in the mission impossible movies  for [ 120 $ ] ( http://www.kv.ee/korter-renoveerimisjargus-pakettaknad-majas-on-kor-2566621.html?nr=1&amp;search_key=f4f68855a20274ae8e6beca1fd37d7ba ),

  ** tl ; dr ** : russia 's 2016-2025 federal space program budget tightens from $ 34 bln on spring 2015 to now $ 21.26 bln , making it on average $ 2.36 bln per year . 
  to put it in a perspective : esa budget for 2015 was $ 4.43 bln . 
  it 's a huge hit in already strained budget . 
  might put several future projects in question , including russian space station and moon exploration .

  / tass / . 
  the draft federal space program ( fcp ) in the years 2016-2025 will contribute to the government later , ahead of schedule , with the volume of financing may uzhatsya to less than 1.5 trillion rubles , 29 october tass source in the space industry . 
  `` despite the fact that there was a task to introduce a document to the government until october 28 , he is still to be confirmed by the relevant ministries and departments . 
  under the new plan , the final draft should be ready by november 12 , after which it will be submitted for approval government '' , - said the source . 
  he noted that previously demanded from the russian space agency to shrink government funding ten-year program of space exploration to 1.5 trillion rubles , to the final version of the figure `` may be even less . '', 
  according to the source agency , roskosmos will defend his proposed program and the necessary funding to the country 's leadership . 
  earlier , deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin said that the president will soon hear a report from the russian space agency on the project fcp , and all the priorities of the program are described in detail . 
  in early october , a source in the space industry told reporters that the financing of the federal space program for 2016-2025 years can be trimmed to 1.5 trillion rubles . 
  he did not specify what aspects of the project can relate to a further decline . 
  in spring 2015 the federal space agency presented a project worth 2.4 trillion rubles , and the budget was planned to receive 2.15 trillion . 
  the program included , inter alia , the creation of a new manned spacecraft , the four lunar mission with the help of automatic stations , the creation of several modules for the international space station , the development of the satellite constellation in several areas . 
  later , the russian space agency said that funding for the program will amount to 2 trillion rubles . 
  several media outlets reported that the finance ministry proposes to reduce the cost of the project up to 1.8 trillion , but at the end of september , the ministry said they did not put forward such claims . 
  at the same time , published earlier draft federal budget for 2016 expenditures for the federal space program for 2016-2025 years were provided in the amount of 2.4 trillion rubles . 
  what people ( or at least : authors of the article ) seem to think is that you should n't be allowed to work in a corporate sector at all . 
  it 's nothing remotely close to the working clauses . 
   if you hate that , work for the eu to become a fully democratic body concerned with the government of transnational european affairs how that would change anything ? 
  in fully democratic countries ` concerned with the government of transnational affairs ' it 's quite common that former ministers become consultants , board members and advisors . 
   how did you deduce to that ? 
  i 'll answer for him : simple logic . 
  in that scenario you 'd look for people from other professions so that they could go back to work after their term , and would n't have any contacts with * ohmygodtheevil * corporations related to the position they took in the commission . 
   we should n't be seeking for carreer making people to serve in the commission it 's not about career making people . 
  imagine you are 40 + years old , go to become a commissioner , then your term ends . 
  you are just under 50 . 
  what you are supposed to do if you can not work in the industry you spent entire life working for ? 
  all experience you ever had is in this industry - that 's why you got to become a commissioner , because you are an expert in what you do , but that 's also why only the most obvious career path for you now is going back to that industry , back having these highly paid positions that public hates so much . 
  you say that he is suppose to `` serve public interest '' - meaning stay unemployed till the retirement ? 
  go working in mcdonalds ? 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  the fact that only 1/3 of them takes these positions is something that should be praised - 2/3 took more difficult path , in some cases probably giving up higher paid jobs just to avoid public opinion seeing their work in a bad light . 
  yes , that 's an effect of lacking high value added companies in our economy as well as generally lower gdp per capita . 
  topic for a separate discussion . 
  do n't get me wrong though - i do agree that poland should be doing more to minimize the emissions and i do agree that this decision from our president was a bad one . 
  just adding some info in before everyone think that poland is the worst country in the entire eu when it comes to pollution - it 's not . 
   poland 's economy is suffering from expensive energy . 
  yes , though it 's not horrible . 
  poland is still significantly below eu average , both : for household and industrial customers . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/energy_price_statistics ) )  keeping inefficient mines open is not going to solve that problem . 
  we have an extremely strong unions and one region ( upper silesia ) with high population ( many voters ) that 's heavily relying on coal industry . 
  no government yet had the balls to dismantle that circus , even though we have privatized mines with weaker unions that mine coal more cheaply and efficiently . 
  that said though : * poland is trying to diversify ( eg . 
  by building a nuclear powerplant ( [ source ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/country-profiles/countries-o-s/poland/ ) ) and constantly expanding our renewable energy sources ( [ related ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/energy/unexpected-victory-renewables-poland-312938 ) ) , even if it 's very difficult to get them running in our country ( low potential for wind , solar and water powerplants ) ) * current coal-based plants have one of the most advanced filtering systems ( [ scrubbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scrubber ) ) , leading to the fact that : * poland still has lower co2 emission per capita than germany ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdgp410&amp;plugin=1 ) ), 
  and yet you still got higher co2 emmisions per capita than poland does . 
  under previous sets of laws isps could do almost everything they wanted when it comes to regulating traffic . 
  they could block voip or certain protocols , they could slow down torrent , they could block youtube , etc. 
  under new regulation all of this is illegal . 
  all the traffic you 'll be getting will be treated equally with an exception of specialized services that might get a priority over all the other traffic , but not to the point of crippling or blocking it ( what wo n't really be your concern if you are a regular customer , and not , say : a specialized corporate or health care institution ) . 
   isps were not allowed to throttle any connection based on it 's destination . 
  they were n't ? 
  where , outside of the uk and netherlands ? 
   now , if youtube pays more than mytube and is on the `` fast internet '' , users will view youtube videos faster than mytube videos , even though they might be on the same infrastructure and essentially bandwidth . 
  current legislation does n't allow that . 
  youtube does n't fulfil anything from the ( vague ) definition of specialised services . 
  and it 'd fall under anti-thrust laws . 
  the part i quoted and we discuss was about negative discrimination . 
  i was n't commenting on the part about positive discrimination . 
  reading comprehension is a rare thing these days , i see ? 
  the positive discrimination against competitors to the customers will fall under anti-thrust laws . 
  this regulation talks about specialized services , not who will get a faster access to the youtube ( despite of what some people say - youtube does not qualify as a specialized service under that definition ) . 
  i also read the law itself , you know , not an article , but the actual text of a law in question :  within the limits of any contractually agreed data volumes or speeds for internet access services , providers of internet access services ** shall not restrict ** the freedoms provided for in paragraph 1 ** by blocking ** , slowing down , degrading or discriminating against specific content , applications or services, 
  funny how we have that now and noone is panicking . 
  eu implements law that keeps on allowing that - and people panic . 
  it 's certainly problematic for the netherlands , and to a degree uk . 
  you are a rare exception across the eu . 
   to allow for the loopholes in this law . 
  more like : to fix them after implementing the law . 
  it 'll certainly be interesting to know how your parliament will handle the situation . 
   this service excluded certain data traffic , like bittorrent , ftp , ssha , telnet , and voice over ip ( voip ) . 
  if users wanted to allow that traffic , they had to pay for a premium service , or to be a customer that 's illegal under this laws too . 
  nothing changes for netherlands in that regard , situation gets improved for others . 
  but that 's why i said `` almost any country '' - netherlands is that exception , and to a degree uk ( though i do n't know the details ) . 
  afaik it 's a significant improvement to the italy , and so it is to poland . 
   provided for stronger effective protections than we have now . 
  care to explain what protection exactly was that ? 
  with a links to an actual laws , please . 
  discussion was about the refugees , not amendments to the telecom . 
  i guess that the clip with recording will be available at a later date , on the ep website . 
  meps have assistants that answer phone calls from the public ... 
   when in reality they did the exact opposite . 
  truth is n't anywhere as simple as it might seem . 
  that legislation contained more measures protecting net neutrality than almost any country in the eu has . 
  there are few holes in the law , but these either can be fixed on a national level or amended later on if any real cases of abuse are fund . 
   second only to the vatican and italy . 
  and yet : italy 55 % . 
  also : greece , the poland of south when it comes to this question . 
  it 's central . 
   well , it would establish that isps are allowed to do so eu-wide , not only in the individual countries . 
  so , it could actually worsen the situation in some countries and allow for abuse of isp priviligies on the cost of consumers .
