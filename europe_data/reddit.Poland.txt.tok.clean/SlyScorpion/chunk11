  way too much history to overcome before we can even think about catching up . 
  it was almost like 1929 again but not nearly as bad ... i think . 
  again ?

  get the stereotypes right , please :p, 
  if the federalization is done right , it can be a good thing . 
  have some overarching eu-wide laws that everyone agrees on , perhaps something along the lines of a constitution , and let the nations within the eu handle their own business without interference unless there is a serious breach of human rights or something like that . 
  we do welcome them ( maybe not with completely open arms , this is poland after all ... ) but then they just up and bugger off to other countries like germany or sweden . 
  no , really , they do . 
  poland , for example , went through 3 partitions throughout its lifetime , the last one ending in 1795 ( there were other `` unofficial '' partitions : the 1815 division of the duchy of warsaw at the congress of vienna and the 1832 incorporation of the `` congress kingdom '' into russia , and the 1846 incorporation of the republic of krak\u00f3w into austria ) . 
  then came world war i , then the great depression , world war ii , and then , finally , the red scare aka communism for about 50 years . 
  mix until thoroughly poor and let rest until room temperature . 
  serves 38 million ( that 's the current population living in poland ) . 
  i hope that bit of history helps to illustrate why poland was poor for all this time .

  how do you mess up the economy if you 're never elected into a position that allows you access to mess up the economy in the first place ? 
  why should he ? 
  he 's not a member of the uk parliament . 
  we can send you some , plenty here in pl .

  spain was under franco until 1978 so that may have had something to do with it , 
  so would `` a democratic state with socialistic leanings '' be a better description ?

  i am not sure , i was a little kid during the commie years so that 's kinda beyond me ... 
  we had the same kind stores , they were called `` pewex '' here  the ones i was referring to earlier were secret and only known to those in the party . 
  the pewexes could be used by anyone ... if they had us dollars . 
  lol , class divide was substituted by member of the party/not member of the party . 
  hell , we had stores here that were only for party members here in poland ( the milicja , the secret police , and other party officials ) . 
  `` my version of communism has never been tried ! '', 
  funny how the amount gets smaller and smaller every post :p, 
  but were they ever a part of the ussr , though ? 
  see , countries in the ussr proper had to rebuild after wwii and endure communism . 
  finland , from what i know , was never part of the ussr and did not have its industries wrecked by that failure of an economic system . 
  hence my edit  but , yeah , having to rebuild from world war ii and having communism for nearly 50 years did not do wonders . 
  btw , were n't western europe countries rebuilt under the [ marshall plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) while everyone else had to fend for themselves ? 
  `` comrade , you must work hard so you can stand in bread line for 5 hours for one loaf of bread ... if you 're lucky ! '', 
  and yes , i stood in bread lines as a kid and i still remember the rationing cards we used to have . 
  they were like communist food stamps . 
  we were forced to divert a majority of our resources ( mostly meat and coal ) to russia . 
  because that 's when communism fell and everyone had to re-do everything almost from scratch since there were no laws in place that accounted for capitalism and actual democracy . 
  there is an old joke from poland 's commie times `` if you 're sitting down or standing up , you 'll get paid 2000 zloty anyways . '', 
  this meant that whether you worked or not , you were getting paid regardless . 
  communism racked up debts here like you would not believe and our leaders ended up selling off most of our industry to foreign interests . 
  hell , we used to actually manufacture our own cars ( yes , manufacture , not assemble which is what we do now ) , have our own shipyards . 
  all that is gone thanks to the massive debts incurred by the previous system . 
  much ? 
  nah , i was n't referring to a difference in opinion , just that these kind of topics tend to turn into witch hunts whether it 's against the immigrants/refugees or the people who are against immigrants/refugees .

  i thought it was the surstr\u00f6mming that did it ? 
  sure sounds like it would kill me ... 
  i upvote topics because they are relevant to europe not because they are about neo nazis or anything of that sort . 
  i would upvote a neo nazi version of this but not because i somehow sympathize with them but to bring it up higher so more people can be informed .
