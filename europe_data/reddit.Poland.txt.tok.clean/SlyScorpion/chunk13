  uhhhhh ... everything old becomes new again ? 
  \\* runs away *, 
  norway has quite a few excellent english speakers so the eu can always ~ ~ poach ~ ~ ask them nicely to work ... 
  having your own currency allows you to set your own fiscal policy , ca n't do that with the euro . 
  maybe he 's just big boned ? 
  he 's saying he does n't want bulgaria tied to the euro because that means being tied to greece and its financial problems . 
  you forgot the austrian achievement rule ;p, 
  \\* after filling out the proper paperwork / s, 
  why should they be abandoned ? 
  we can always have politicians duke out their differences there , make it a pay-per-view event . 
  i was referring to the very concept of the olympics overall , 
  zun du tu vil no ze butiful deutsch spik !, 
  ( soon you too will know the beautiful german language ), 
  it 's not mine though  http://www.davidpbrown.co.uk/jokes/european-commission.html, 
  referenda whether to hold referenda in 7 countries perhaps ? 
  but who will be the belligerent this time ? 
  just wait for kaczynski to say something again and we 'll be right back in the spotlight . 
  or we can program our janusz korwin-mikke bot to embarrass us in the eu parliament in case of a national emergency ... 
  did n't the olympics start somewhere in greece ? 
  it will for a bit and then someone will re-brand it and we 'll get another 4 letter abbreviation to worry about . 
   more diversity ok , but the diverse people need to actually chose majors that focus on engineering , it and the like . 
  damn , it has been a while since i saw that movie , thanks , 
  the european commission has announced an agreement whereby english will be the official language of the eu , rather than german , which was the other contender . 
  her majesty 's government conceded that english spelling had room for improvement and has therefore accepted a five-year phasing in of `` euro-english '' . 
  in the first year , `` s '' will replace the soft `` c '' . 
  sertainly , this will make sivil servants jump for joy . 
  the hard `` c '' will be dropped in favour of the `` k '' , which should klear up some konfusion and allow one key less on keyboards . 
  there will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year , when the troublesome `` ph '' will be replaced with `` f '' , making words like `` fotograf '' 20 % shorter . 
  in the third year , publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible . 
  governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling . 
  also , al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent `` e '' is disgrasful . 
  by the fourth yer , peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing `` th '' with `` z '' and `` w '' with `` v '' . 
  during ze fifz yer , ze unesesary `` o '' kan be dropd from vords kontaining `` ou '' and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters . 
  after zis fifz yer , ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl . 
  zer vil be no mor trubls or difikultis and everivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer . 
  please take anything anne applebaum says with a pillar of salt . 
  she tends to veer towards unresearched hyperbole ... a lot . 
  stockholm is in sweden though ... 
  no , no , it 's right over there , pining for the fjords underneath this parrot !, 
  perfect !, 
  now we need to round up some british actors for it ^ while ^ we ^ can, 
  i wish there was a show called `` yes , eu minister '' to parody eu politics ... 
  i have the gnome screenshot tool but it takes forever to do something so i use nimbus , 
  i am using linux , 
  so instead of going after the corruption they 're going after the people who exposed said corruption , am i right ? 
   kde spectacle oh hello fellow penguin , 
  `` scramble outta london ! '', 
  right . 
  nimbus has the `` entire page '' option as well , 
  and the uk will float away ... 
  nimbus allows me to specify which area of the website in question i want to take a picture of  but i think your command is good to know just in case , thank you !, 
  oh i knew about the turkish population in berlin and saw the significance of the turkish flag there  i asked my question to the people grousing about how germany is not doing anything more to help , 
  * 966 - poland takes on christianity as a religion ( `` chrzest polski '' ) * 1410 - the battle of grunwald * 1569 - formation of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth * 1791 - may 3rd constitution ( `` konstytucja 3 maja '' ) * 1920 - battle of warsaw * 1944 - warsaw uprising against nazi occupation * 1944 - commie time starts here and goes on until 1989 * 1989 - communism falls and the wild 90s begin, 
  so i got ta ask . 
  what do people expect germany do here ? 
  they ca n't just drop in batman style into turkey and be all `` right lads , we heard you have a bit of a terrorist problem , no worries , we 'll sort it out for you ! '', 
  my scenario is a bit simplistic but i would really like to know just what people are expecting germany , or any country , to do ? 
   nobody is giving away arms and military vehicles that ukraine needs , nobody is doing anything for the crimea , and doing so little for the eastern ukraine . 
  what do you expect them to do ? 
  any action taken by the west could , potentially , be used against the west by russia . 
  - paul reverescu, 
  that 's why i use nimbus screenshot . 
  it lets you make a screengrab of a webpage and just the webpage , no worries about potentially embarrassing browser tabs :d, 
  [ mexico export tree map for the curious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ybhldow.jpg ), 
  thanks for the heads up , 
  someone needs to put points in their diplomacy skill , i see . 
  all you need is a romanian version of paul revere on a horse riding through romania ... 
  they fell off the back of a truck , honest !, 
  hmmm on second thought , maybe ? 
  i do know there is a visa lottery but i think they call it a `` diversity visa '' or something officious ... 
  do you have any concrete proof of that ? 
  what is it that you expect germany to do here ? 
  [ it 's legit ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/jun/28/im-still-alive-queen-jokes-on-northern-ireland-visit-video ), 
  tears are salty thus `` salty '' means that someone is , or has been , crying . 
  a lot of us firms did that with china ( moved factories over there ) and mexico nowadays and guess what ? 
  there is no investment in those countries and in the meantime people in the us lost those jobs forever . 
  if you have a pulse , sure . 
  did n't know about the changes in algorithm around here , i do n't keep up with the site stuff , 
   but some people prefer to live on welfare rather than switch location . 
  do they , really ? 
  perhaps it 's too expensive to move to another city or they have no family to help them get the money to move to a location where there 's jobs to be found ? 
  while there are benefits scroungers of all kinds of nationalities , not all people in a shitty situation want to be on the dole ... 
  i always thought that americans were seen as loud tourists . 
  perhaps that 's changed over the years . 
  you ca n't eat the sand of those beautiful beaches ... 
  what about albino irish people ? 
  this, 
  an italian who does n't know every pizza ?!? 
  well , there goes my obviously skewed and stereotypical worldview !, 
  which one has meat on it ? 
  i can not speak foreign , i 'll have you know :p, 
  we have something similar with our police and a couple of other public sector jobs but i am not sure which ones atm . 
  tl ; dr our police in poland can retire after 20 years of work ... 
  that topic has 1712 upvotes , much more than the one we are in right now . 
  [ does this look like a far right/alt right site to you ? 
  ] ( http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/07/8-things-white-people-race/ ) there are many others like it so i am not sure how that sentiment would be held by the group ( s ) you mention . 
  [ we have one about ze germans too :p ] ( http://i.imgur.com/evzvuvs.png ), 
  i should 've phrased that better . 
  `` it is impossible by definition to be racist against a white person '' is what i should 've written . 
  it 's south east of our capital , ok ?
