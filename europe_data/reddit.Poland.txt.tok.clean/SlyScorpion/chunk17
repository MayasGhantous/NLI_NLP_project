  euro going down will be good for me as i buy a lot of things from ebay . 
  you mean hollande ? 
  holland is a nice country , hollande is some french dude who wo n't be important in 10-20 years :p, 
  will warsaw going on lockdown mean i will have problems using public transport ? 
   i can only eat so much deep fried food !, 
  do it for your country , do it for freedom !, 
  sad to say but my country is somewhat ruled by the catholic church . 
  i mean we have a konkordat signed with them ffs ... 
   russia  eu nope , sorry , we 've seen what happens when they get into any sort of organization . 
  nope nope nope . 
   but you 're not being ruled from brussels for now ... 
  one of the things that shaped the u.s. identity was a civil war . 
  do we really want one in europe ? 
  because you ca n't have everything else without the money . 
  as soon as i read `` second largest economy '' i knew it was about the money . 
  if a smaller country like mine decided to exit the eu , no one would give a damn but when the uk decides that it has had enough then you see all these other countries shaking in their boots because they might no longer be getting that delicious uk money . 
  face it , no one cares about `` unity , progress , etc. '', 
  it 's all about the money . 
  you could say both sides of the debate are using the `` pulling facts out of our asses '' fallacy then . 
  i am not british but jesus christ , this guy makes the classic `` call to authority '' fallacy within the first two minutes . 
  why have the brits voted this man in ? 
  he of course manages to get some fearmongering in there with `` economy , british families ... etc '' . 
  soon, 
   #trexit you need to be in the eu before you can exit the eu :p, 
  give it time and merkel will invite them round again just to be sure ... 
  on the one hand , i hope for a brexit just to see what really happens instead of what all these corrupted politicians and their economist stooges tell us will happen . 
  on the other hand , it is rather worrying ... 
  so murdoch is a wannabe george soros then ? 
  here 's one for my country : http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=poland, 
   americans love poland but can they find it on a map ? 
   secret prisons well , they 're not really secret if everyone knows about them now , are they ? 
   no earthquakes or tsunamis but we do have our floods every now and then ... 
  so they want enslave people via welfare then ? 
  because that 's what happens when you give people money for simply existing : you get enslaved to the government . 
  no denying of historical fact on my part but at least christianity and its branches , such as catholicism , has gone through several reforms , one of them being the new testament . 
  has islam done the same ? 
  look at all those doctors and engineers !, 
  wow !, 
  ca n't say i am shocked about this ... 
  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/574565/the_casey_review.pdf link to the original report . 
  and i do n't blame them , to be honest . 
  news to me , i thought it was already a state / s, 
  since the founder of the religion married a 9 year old girl while being approximately 50 years old . 
  department of motor vehicles aka the office where they hand out driver 's licenses ... 
  breaks the narrative . 
  not as scary as ireland 's . 
  not saying that makes us saints but it could be worse ... 
  yeah but we also do n't have `` gay cure '' therapies or try to `` pray the gay away '' either ... 
   your first piont is certainly not true yeah , it actually is as i 've spoken to quite a few poles who returned after working in various we countries and they all pretty much said the same thing : way too many muslims in we cities . 
  [ finland does not exist ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/finlandconspiracy/comments/2y0oog/the_finland_conspiracy_and_all_you_need_to_know/ ), 
  there are several factors that may come into play . 
  one would be poles who have returned from working abroad in western european countries . 
  perhaps they saw large muslim populations wherever they worked and were not entirely comfortable with this and told their immediate family and friends about this . 
  another might be the correlation between the various attacks and events one hears about in the media ( think about the attacks in nice , the mass rapes in cologne , and other high profile cities ) . 
  since the countries where these kind of attacks happened do have a sizeable muslim population , it 's not difficult for the average pole to draw the conclusion that where there are lots of muslims , there are higher chances of an attack or event like the ones in many we cities might happen . 
  in short , look at this list of attacks http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/list-of-terrorist-attacks-that-have-struck-europe-in-2016/ and you can see why poles might have a slightly negative opinion on muslims . 
  13th century ? 
  awfully generous of you ... 
  i was hoping this would tank the euro some when compared to the pln but nope , that dastardly currency remains costly as ever . 
  in any case , good luck italy with whatever happens post-referendum . 
  something tells me you 'll need it . 
   the last thing the eu wants is another referendum about the eu because they keep on losing them . 
  maybe it 's high time the eu examined just * why * they are losing one referendum after another ... 
  there 's always iceland ... 
  because our government should not be making statements about what ireland , or any other country , should teach in their schools ...

  how does one pay for/take care of all those kids ?!?!, 
  this is embarrassing ... 
  this !, 
  why did the majority of them have such short terms , if i am reading this correctly ? 
   the soviet union however had a lot more efficient governing system how was it exactly efficient ? 
  care to clarify ? 
  because , from where i sit , it was the polar opposite of efficient . 
  it is n't . 
  it 's another belgium : a mythical land that does not exist in reality  . , 
  from the comments : `` when europe sends its people here they are not sending their best . '', 
  - bob jones, 
   what do you mean by this that the soviet union was horribly governed , perhaps ? 
  i am addressing this point in your post : `` soviet union was governed a lot better than the russian empire . '', 
  let 's see what happened in the su : - centrally planned economy that led to shortages everywhere - secret police to stifle dissent - holodomor , which was created on purpose ( great governance there , i say ! ), 
   pokie machines https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slot_machine, 
  last i checked britain was n't a muslim country ... 
   soviet union was governed a lot better i 'm sorry but i ca n't read this with a straight face . 
  please tell me how an empire that had the holodomor was better governed ...

  hmmm not sure if it counts but they do have the capacity to produce nuclear weapons but they choose not to do so : http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=125898396 click on the `` technological potential for nuclear weapons '' menu item . 
  except hitler had almost no checks to his power unlike the person you are alluding to ...
