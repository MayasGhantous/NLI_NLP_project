  just get used to it since , apparently , the police does n't appear to be doing much ? 
   i will call them dumb , stupid , idiotic , ignorant , racist , sexist , anti-scientific , in support of religious bigotry , jingoist and authoritarian because these are some of the things they are . 
  objectively . 
  what kind of mental gymnastics are you performing in order to apply your subjective labels to a rather large group of people , all the while claiming it 's objective ? 
  but can you sway the may ? 
  ha ... ha ... i laugh now please ^ do n't ^ anschluss ^ me :p, 
  it 's an idiom :p, 
  which is funny because they live in a country that , in a way , may be seen as the end goal of the eu : full federalization and integration and a monetary union of states . 
  brexit means brexit / s sorry , could n't help it : /, 
  lol , most vpns might keep logs so good luck with that . 
  sure , there are vpns that claim they do n't keep your logs but how can you be sure ? 
  politicians should * definitely * be monitored . 
  they are unscrupulous little creatures who will take any amount of money if they think no one 's looking . 
   move your imagination for poland should be `` pay moni , gtfo , come again , gtfo again . '', 
  depends on how they constructed the survey . 
  while it is just a tv show , yes , prime minister brilliantly illustrated how by asking questions in a certain way you can have a person agree with what you want , thus , skewing the results , . . 
  we might not have an antifmafia commission but we have something close , the cba `` centralne biuro antykorupcyjne '' or `` anticorruption bureau '' . 
  because finland does n't exist !, 
  we have germans all up in our country all the time . 
  they come here for the cheap beer . 
  ca n't swing a dead cat without smacking a german with it ... 
  what matters most is the fact that someone can butcher a toblerone . 
  forget things that could affect the civilized world ... muh toblerones !, 
  well ... we do have those old `` polish death camps '' just laying around . . why not convert them to `` polish holding camps '' instead ? 
  which one is polska a and which one is polska b ? 
  germany - nice people , decent tourists when they come to poland , for the most part . 
  ukraine - hard workers , they assimilate easily into polish society if they choose to emigrate here . 
  czech republic - their humor . 
  hungary - they used to be our neighbours and we have one of the longest lasting friendships so they get included . 
  maybe i was in the wrong state a couple of months ago but i was in florida and there did n't seem to be anything in the air as far as `` nationalist angst '' is concerned . 
  personally speaking from my own experience of having lived in the us for over 20 years and from my recent two month trip over there , i do n't think there is that much of a rising nationalist movement going on , trump 's antics notwithstanding . 
  i think a part of it might be the media capitalizing on some of this shit , but again that 's just my personal opinion , 
  i am not saying that the us will never go full nazi but i kinda doubt people will let it just slide into that kind of mentality . 
  trump is unpopular in the us and the charlottesville thing is actually a protest tied to the removal of a confederate general ( the torches are not helping the protest 's image i will admit ) . 
  people are also constantly protesting against trump in the us in various places so , as of right now , there is no need to worry about the us going full nazi . 
  also , the us is one of the least racist places you can go to these days . 
  \\ #notallpoles not all `` muh eu = 4th reich '' screaming ninnies are polish . 
  wear shoes . 
  socks + sandals deserve death and then resurrection and then death again / s, 
  lol my country does n't even appear on that graph . 
  it is richer . 
  the golden rule : he who has the gold , makes the rules . 
  what exactly is `` white culture '' , though ? 
  i think we might have a few and the few that we probably have are usually small-to-mid size business owners ... 
   acne really ? 
  a clothes line named after a skin condition ? 
  `` kombinowanie '' `` kombinatorstwo '' it 's a polish art of taking care of business . 
  we have one guy who is a monarchist in our country and that guy is janusz korwin-mikke . 
  damn and you missed my [ reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bielefeld_conspiracy ), 
  yes . 
  nepotism , cronyism , sometimes outright bribery , other shady deals . 
  are you in bielefeld ? 
  a geographic state of mind . 
  we want our own marshal plan with blackjack and hookers !, 
  `` golds '' would be a literal translation for the name of our currency :d, 
  we have `` oiros '' . 
  it 's a linguistic corruption of the word `` euros '' ... other examples : `` eurasy '' . 
  if it was n't for your czech flair , i would 've assumed you were a polish person describing the situation in poland . 
  tl ; dr we have almost the same situation in poland ... 
  at least you forced them to keep the spelling . 
  do you know that in * my * country we have people called `` brajan '' ( read it as `` brian '' ) . 
  [ reees in polish ], 
  before wwi , we were still not on the map thanks to the russian empire , austria , and germany . 
  interbellum : we were doing ok-ish , if `` finally existing as an independent state '' is considered ok-ish , until we had to fend off the goddamn bolsheviks in 1920 because commies just wanted to share their worthless revolution with their neighbors . 
  we would have to define `` unreasonable '' in this case , i suppose . 
  unless german law already has that properly defined :p, 
  we have the `` pan slavic '' edgelords here ... 
   kelly  kevin proper portuguese names those :p, 
  of course . 
  but do n't most civilized countries have some sort of self-defense class for women that would most likely teach them the proper use of pepper spray/mace ? 
   it also can harm the `` attacker '' . 
  oh no , we should totally worry about that poor attacker being harmed by pepper spray or mace . 
  ok , i can see why guns would be illegal but why would your country outlaw pepper spray or mace ? 
  their economic situation , apparently . 
  already living in one , thanks . 
  against it because if i am reading the various sources about it correctly it could impact our ports in that larger ships will not be able to come due to their undersides going too deep and we would n't be able to properly expand our ports later on because the pipeline would be in the way . 
  also , i 'd rather have american gas than have anyone give more money to the russian state . 
  hell no :d, 
  all of them and because they are politicians . 
  so v8 then ? 
  sweet !, 
  russia is too big for the plc , though :d, 
  soooo yugoslavia alpha version ? 
  [ suicides in lithuanian ], 
  for all of those items you listed ? 
  i pay 40 usd a month . 
  damn , i remember that article being posted in r/europe a while back  still , lithuania 's got you beat ... 
  shoes : skechers with the memory foam since my feet hurt after a while with shoes that do n't have that miraculous invention built-in . 
  both of those can be used to describe poles ( speaking from experience :p ) , though . 
  well , some of us call austrians `` fritzle '' ( fritzls ) ... 
  so would you rather be a `` cygan '' or a `` fritzl '' ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afkzclmws1u ), 
  hell nope . 
  you mean `` wilno '' ? 
   slow like an estonian is another one , everything from there is seen as super-slow . 
  like , remember that scene from matrix movie , where neo is shot at by the agents and the bullets slow down and stop in the air ? 
  he picks one , looks at it and it 's written `` made in estonia '' on the bullet . 
  top banter right there ... 
  try the feminine version instead `` cyganka '' :p when you call her a `` cygan '' , you 're calling her a male gypsy :d, 
  i see it on youtube comments , 4chan , and sometimes reddit .
