  besides , how is someone supposed to know what jobs are going to be shipped overseas or automated in say 10-15-25 years down the road ? 
  no need to apologize , 
  never stated anywhere that i wanted the center of europe to be poland . 
  where did you even get that from what i said ? 
  man , it 's getting to the point that anytime a pole says anything people automatically assume we want to be the center of attention or whatever . 
  please show me where i said `` a europe centered around poland '' and do try not putting words in my statement where there are n't any , 
  or they switched parties ... 
  reddit upvotes , retweets ! = actual votes . 
  what ? 
  i am not saying anything bad about france but you have to admit that france and germany are basically the center of the eu if we take influence , their economies , and other factors into consideration . 
  we kinda already have the division . 
  the western portion hates the east because they see them as monetary drains and convenient buffer zones between them and russia . 
  western europe hates the south because they see them as monetary drains . 
  the far north ( scandinavian countries ) have their little clique and could n't give two shits about the rest of europe . 
  cccp did nothing wrong , eh ? 
  what you did there , i see it . 
  why not ? 
  i am not a fan of the russian government . 
  what are checks and balances ? 
  hate trump all you want but do n't act like he has absolute power . 
  he means trump has no idea about erdogan . 
  because the majority of women would fail the standard tests required in order to enter military training and no , lowering the standards will not work .

  true , they 'd probably need to fill out a bunch of forms in triplicate before they could even think about any sort of `` sabre rattling '' in the first place . 
  i am glad to live in europe and watch the limp-wristed european lefties quiver in fear :d, 
  may i ask what points of mine you do not agree with , if you do n't mind ? 
  how about a call for a better europe , rather than just relying on `` strength '' ? 
  i would like to see a europe where someone , who has been made `` redundant '' ( yes , i hear this term being bandied about in this subreddit all the time when referring to people of the working class ) , can go and better themselves and still be able to live a normal life . 
  i would like to see a europe that is n't just centered on france and germany . 
  i would also like to see a europe with some balls and not some spineless entity that just stands by and watches as a portion of ukraine gets annexed and we have a war going on in our own damn backyard . 
  can we get that ? 
  or is it just going to be more sabre rattling and everything will remain the same ? 
  no , thank you . 
  we 've been through the russian version of `` change '' a few years ago :p ( cccp was worst cccp ), 
  poland does . 
  american citizen living in poland here : ca n't wait to see what happens . 
  might even turn off the gas in the winter as the butthurt from the us left/liberals/the screaming ninnies that voted for hillary will keep me very warm .

  oh , i have not mentioned the * perceived value * of any given social media site , just that there exists more than one social media outlet . 
  forgive me if i come off rude or obtuse , but when we delve into the * perceived value * of a social media outlet , are we not moving the goalposts ever so slightly ? 
  yes , all those candidates competing within the 2 parties to see [ who will be the walrus and who will be the carpenter ] ( http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/walrus.html ), 
  i suggest reading up on franklin delano roosevelt and just why the americans enacted term limits after him . 
  as long as the lgbt community 's right to boycott and campaign against such businesses is not interfered with , sure . 
  if , on the other hand , they have no choice , no means of pushing back against such discrimination due to unfavorable laws , then no . 
  those haircuts ... dudes look like they just stepped out from a photo shoot . 
  guess i 'm a racist then . 
  they do n't have segregation laws/ordinances backing them up so no , they do n't decide . 
  also , why would they decide such a thing ? 
  it would just drive customers away and put them out of business since people can freely boycott and use word of mouth to shut the company down . 
  so you 'd rather have the same person elected , however they get elected notwithstanding , over and over and over and over ? 
  also , europe tends to have some history of third , fourth , etc. 
  parties getting into power whereas the u.s. has been a two-party system so it 's not like the americans actually have that much to choose from . 
  their problem gets even more compounded when they 're told `` if you vote for this guy , you 're actually giving your vote to the person you do n't want in power '' . 
  it was an ~ ~ law ~ ~ ordinance enforced by the city of montgomery at the time : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosa_parks#montgomery_buses:_law_and_prevailing_customs,

  yes , it 's called google plus or nasza klasa ( although the latter may already be rather on the dead side ... ) or even vkontaktya ... 
  `` the spy who no longer loves me '' now in theatres !, 
   remember when a baker refused to bake lgbt propaganda cake in the uk or a printshop refused to print lgbt leaflets in poland ? 
  the people being discriminated against still have the choice to go to another business that will serve them the way they wish to be served , if we put aside the separate issue of discrimination . 
  if , for example , lgbt topics were to be censored then no baker or print shop would bake an lgbt cake or print a leaflet concerning lgbt topics . 
  under censorship you have no choice whereas if you do n't agree with a site 's terms of use you can use another site . 
  i never mentioned either of those points , i was simply bringing up the fact that people will protest against laws that are already in place , that 's all . 
  you do understand that the people in my example were protesting a law that was already in place . 
  it was already decided on , passed through all the necessary legislature already . 
  oh , they can criticize private companies , sure , but `` free speech '' is n't free on private property and `` censorship '' is usually the domain of the government and it 's enforced by law and you have no choice in the matter . 
  when you log onto facebook and the like , you are told what the terms of use are when using facebook and you have a choice to either abide by the agreement or not use facebook and other sites like it . 
  tl ; dr censorship is enforced by law , regulation of speech is agreed upon by both parties .
