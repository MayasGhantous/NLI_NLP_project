  none of them , they were either drunks or corrupted to the core like every other modern politician . 
  at least you can depict their prophet/religious leader figure without the radicals calling a jihad on you . 
  no , i am a firm believer in the separation of church and state and i would not want a religious political party , or one that is there solely to represent the interests of a particular religion , in power no matter the denomination or creed . 
   the poles are the vodka germans lol i like this one but i think it 's mostly our silesians you have in mind :p, 
  you 're all basketball players . 
  there , you 're welcome :p, 
  all of the former collective farming towns in poland . 
  nothing but poverty and more poverty in those places . 
  only english because everyone else seems to switch to english as soon as you attempt to speak in their language and for a good reason too as hearing someone butcher a given language can be a bit grating . 
  you forgot two worlds but ok , that was n't all that great to begin with ... 
  movies - during commie times we made good movies . 
  post commie times ? 
  90 % of the movies we have are absolute trash as they try so damn hard to emulate the u.s. and fail at it . 
  i heard it mentioned more along the lines of `` she 's a real battle axe '' aka she 's a hard woman to deal with so not a compliment at all ... 
   messerschmitt basically their planes , yeah  sample usage in pl-land : `` oh , she 's a real messerschmitt , that one ! '', 
  not swedish but in poland i 've heard messerschmidt being used to describe someone who barks out orders like a messerschmidt would shoot bullets : quickly and loudly :d, 
  we just use `` ekspert '' ( literally `` expert '' ) or `` kanapowy ekspert '' ( couch expert ) . 
  the source i cited stated that `` herba thee '' was the trade name given to tea by the dutch , if i am translating it correctly . 
  so it could 've been used outside of netherlands but not in the country itself ... 
  sounds like our political class . 
  [ is this you ? 
  neither have i , just stating what one source had to say about the etymology of the word . 
  i could be in the wrong about this and all so if you have a better source then please share , 
   the ones from the east you 're probably right . 
  i 've mostly met americans and folks from the uk in warsaw . 
  then again , i do n't go out of my way to talk to tourists anyways . 
  well , maybe the op meant `` iced coffee '' or whatever that is ? 
  all i know is that `` cuppa '' usually means `` cup of coffee '' in american english ... 
  at work , nescafe instant coffee with no milk . 
  tastes vile but at least i am not dependent on the coffee making machine that tends to break every now and then . 
  also , the vile taste keeps me alert . 
  at home , same coffee but with milk & sugar but the taste is good then . 
  also , i am not a connoiseur of coffee , i just want the caffeine bennies . 
  cup of coffee . 
  i watched some spanish broadcasts recently and with my hearing problems and how fast you guys speak spanish i think i will just ask if a person speaks english if i ever get the chance to visit spain . 
  ha , we used to build ships but the commies ran so many debts that our shipyards were sold off in the 90s ... 
  our president also has been making a lot of journeys to china but i think he 's trying to kiss up to them for trade reasons ... 
  would love to but it looks like we 're going for that service economy achievement ... 
  does croatia have factories or any sort of sizeable manufacturing sector ? 
  do n't you get some polish tourists at least ? 
  it 's because , according to this site ( in polish ) : http://sciaga.pl/slowniki-tematyczne/6881/herbata/ , we borrowed the dutch `` herba thee '' which in turn borrowed the word `` herba '' from latin . 
  you can thank the dutch and romans for that one :p, 
  poland :  article 243  the constitution of the republic of poland shall come into force on the expiry of the 3-month period following the day of its promulgation . 
  i do n't think tourists even attempt to speak polish . 
  we have assembly plants , the actual manufacturing of parts to be assembled is done in china , taiwan , thailand . 
  we used to have factories but they got sold off after communism fell . 
  as for homemade family businesses ... lol , they would get eaten alive by the ridiculous taxes we have here that punish small business owners . 
  when just about everything has the `` made in china '' tag it 's rather difficult to do so . 
  what it means for me is that we get flooded with inferior products from china . 
  warsaw because only polska a matters !, 
  i picked up the snacking on cereal late at night habit from living in the us . 
  my gf who lived in poland all her life just looks at me funny when i do this :d, 
  have someone else make it for you ? 
  fanny because apparently it is offensive in the uk ( or was at some point ... ), 
  we went through the national stadium meme here too : /, 
  we have the `` grandma/grandpa '' scheme here . 
  people will call up elderly people and try to tell them they are their grandson ( daughter ) and they have been in an accident . 
  if the elderly person falls for it then the `` grandson '' sends out a friend to collect the money . 
  basically this ... 
  it 's none of their business as to how we handle our internal affairs . 
  the abortion issue is a thorny one , yes , but let us get through this without some eu commissioner tut-tutting about it . 
  let 's not forget the old `` szwedzki st\u00f3\u0142 '' ( swedish table ) - used to describe an all-you-can-eat buffet . 
  same . 
  `` czeski film '' ( czech movie ) - used to describe a situation so ridiculous in nature that it could only be the plot of a czech movie . 
  `` wyj\u015b\u0107 po angielsku '' ( to leave like an englishman ; english exit ) - to leave a party or gathering without being noticed or saying goodbye . 
  `` niemiecka precyzja , hiszpa\u0144ski temperament '' ( german precision , spanish temperament ) - used to describe something that works well but also has a wild/aggressive/macho ( take your pick ) side to it aka practical and exciting . 
  `` chinski badziew '' ( chinese crap ) - used to describe something of inferior quality . 
  `` kozak '' ( cossack ) - used to describe someone as tough and someone you do n't mess with . 
  also can be used as a way to ask someone if they think they are a tough guy ( `` co , kozak z ciebie ?! '', 
  ) `` cygani\u0107 '' ( to act like a gypsy ) - describes someone who is very low i.e. 
  they steal , they borrow money that they never pay back , other really shady stuff . 
  bonus round : `` choroba filipi\u0144ska '' ( philippines disase/sickness ) - this was a phrase used by one of our presidents ( andrzej kwa\u015bniewski ) to describe well ... [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ueorn9asdw ) . 
  i 've heard it being called `` russian shower '' or `` hooker shower '' in poland . 
  i 'd be getting ready for war * because i just know one would erupt if the federalization were to happen the way you describe . 
  * aka i 'd be looking for a bunker . 
  [ head cheese too ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_cheese ), 
  did the `` party until you blackout '' thing all through my twenties . 
  once i turned 30 it just got boring and embarrassing . 
  i would live in the u.s. or canada as those are english-speaking countries and english is the only other language i know besides polish . 
  edit : australia or new zealand would also be good choices . 
  same . 
  no way . 
  that 's like moving into a house that 's on fire ... 
  vodka !, 
  i am worried that i wo n't get to visit ( seriously , one british pound is worth 5 zloty ... i 'd have to sell a body part or something to go there ! ), 
  the country . 
  all in all to me they are r/madlads the country :p, 
  [ they sometimes come in pairs ... ] ( http://www.jmfarrisphotography.com/img/s/v-3/p215704885-3.jpg ), 
  `` deadly '' as in it tastes good or `` deadly '' as in you have to sign a waiver before you eat it so that you absolve the establishment of any responsibility in the even you die of a heart attack from the food ? 
  you 're probably right . 
  it also does n't help somewhat that it 's a feminine adjective/noun/verb whereas english is gender-neutral . 
  hohoho ... speaking of disgusting huge grasshoppers ... take a look at [ this living nightmare !, 
  ] ( http://img15.deviantart.net/5d7d/i/2010/248/3/e/georgia_thumper_by_gitona-d2y3303.jpg ), 
  yeah , it does n't tend to lend itself too well to english ... just sounds janky , to my ears , when i try to fit in a `` kurwa '' with everyday english sentences ... 
  ehhh , it 's usually seen as low class in most places and people will look at you funny in some places if you go around swearing in public . 
  i should 've specified `` the locals '' part , i just ca n't believe the locals picking that word up and actually using it :p, 
  ichuj : for when you really want to giver her the dick !, 
  going to west germany , berlin ... seeing the berlin wall from the west side up close ... 
  not sure , i am a city slicker myself so i do n't know much about the mountainous regions of poland .
