  i should rectify this mistake , though . 
  you might be better off asking your g\u00f3ralka friend , 
   i do n't know what other people see in a more federal eu . 
  before we become a federation , we may experience some internal conflict . 
  look at the history of the us , a federal union of states , and what it went through . 
  remember , they had a civil war where one half of the country was fighting the other half for various reasons . 
  look at what 's happening in the eu now . 
  you have the smaller , perhaps poorer , nations bickering with the larger , richer countries ( see the recent situation with hungary and poland as one example ) . 
  tl ; dr i am worried that the road to a true eu federation may be a very rough one if we compare it to another federal union . 
  aka retards attempting poetry . 
  no wonder poles assimilate so well in germany . 
  complaining is in our blood ... 
  i got ta see this to believe it :d, 
  it 's vulgar but the polish `` suffix '' that is the phrase `` i chuj '' . 
  it 's used kind of like this : `` i went to a friend 's house to get drunk i chuj ! '', 
  we have `` najedzony '' in pl ... 
  in german it would be a whole sentence too but you guys just bolt the words together to avoid having a sentence in the first place :p, 
  google translate always translates `` geil '' to `` horny '' when i try to translate any german text containing that word , 
  the word `` curva '' means `` to turn '' in a few languages but it becomes `` kurwa '' ( whore , slut ) in polish ... 
   both are pronounced exactly the same this might be the root of the problem for both french and english , to be honest . 
  holding the door for someone who is just behind you is considered a common courtesy so people just say `` thanks '' and move on . 
  i can appreciate the public transportation here . 
  having lived in a country where it 's mandatory to have a car or you are literally going nowhere , i appreciate the fact that i am no longer chained to a car and its associated costs . 
  so that 's why we tend to get a few confused norwegian arctic explorers every now and again :p, 
   there are polar bears here heyyyy ... we had that one attributed to us , i think . 
  good news is that spain is not going anywhere so perhaps one day you 'll get a chance to re-visit the country , 
  ah yeah , that part is bad ... 
  what about danelaw ? 
  someone shows a german an uncensored version of a video game with blood and swastikas . 
  reich mode triggered nation-wide . 
  oh , and a pole steals merkel 's car . 
  it 's ok , pierre b ______________, 
  til we have schools ... / s, 
  brits . 
  their excesses are infamous especially in krakow for some odd reason . 
  `` human interaction !, 
  the horror ! '', 
  polan stronk, 
  the winter season . 
  `` privyet '', 
  we 're slowly getting rid of those commieblocks but i will not deny that we still have some , especially in the poorer parts of poland . 
  well , to be honest , we do have our alcoholics who either collect whatever metal scrap they can find to sell for money or they outright beg for money . 
  different addiction but the result is the same : we have our crazies too , 
  got tired of living hand to mouth all the time even if i was working a job that required some skill ( i worked as a mechanic ... ) . 
  looking back , maybe i was just a shitty mechanic ? 
  would n't be surprised if that was the case :d i got tired of the jingoism culture that tends to show up here and there . 
  there 's always this need for `` rah rah we 're the best woo ! '', 
  kind of enthusiasm in the workplace and i 've worked in quite a few workplaces in the us . 
  here in poland , people know that you do your job because you need to fucking eat so the last thing they are going to do is make you lose the last shred of dignity you possess by having you affect the `` all is well ! '', 
  attitude . 
  the politics . 
  oh man , the politics . 
  the eternal two-party system that the us has and the way it seems to be set up that if you vote for someone who is not a democrat or republican then you are just basically throwing your vote away . 
  in poland , you may have a lot of parties and it might be a bit confusing at first but at least you know that your party can get some representation in our equivalent of the house of representatives and the parties have to work together in coalitions so there 's at least some cohesion . 
  of course , pl politics still has its mudslinging and muckraking and party conflicts ... lastly , i stopped feeling safe over there . 
  hell , i went back a year or so ago to visit because our company was opening an office there and i was outside the new office smoking and i got accosted by a dude in a full face mask asking me if some dude 's car was mine and if i would have a problem if he smashed it . 
  yes , it was one incident at that time but it added to the growing feeling that it does n't take much to get you killed over there , it seems . 
  now , i do n't have much to my name in poland but i have a roof over my head , plenty of money in the bank by polish standards , and i do n't have to fear for my life if i go outside at 2 in the morning to go to the gas station . 
  lived in the us , living in poland . 
  i prefer to live in poland . 
  please keep your freedoms . 
  `` drevni kocur '', 
  i actually like french people , it 's the damned language that drives me crazy every time i encounter it ... sorry !, 
   g\u0159ego\u0159 b\u0159eu\u010di\u0161\u010dikievi\u010d czechia pls . 
  yes ? 
  each one of those letters is enunciated . 
  once you get over the initial shock `` omg , it 's full of consonants !, 
  '' , it 's rather easy , 
  `` i heard you guys were communists and live in commieblocks ! ', 
  will eesti ever into nordic ? 
  build wall, 
  * germans - busybodies with a weird sense of humor . 
  * czechs : speak a bizarro version of polish where the polish word for `` to search '' ( szuka\u0107 ) becomes the czech word for `` to fuck '' . 
  also , pepiki . 
  * hungarians : our bro country and paprika lovers . 
  * french : snooty people with a written language that discards its letters when spoken ( `` you see this word bordeaux ? 
  yeah guess what , fuck half those letters , we do n't enunciate them !, 
  hon hon hon !, 
  yes , the `` n '' is silent in `` hon ! '' ), 
  * english : drunken street wreckers * irish : if polish people had a sense of humor , they 'd be irish . 
  * slovakia : vacation spot * slovenia : vacation spot but with a slightly different name * austrians : literally hitler , yodelling . 
   locked up for hate speech not in poland we do n't , you 're thinking of germany and the u.k. 
  have you played papers , please ? 
  yeah , ours were just about like that pre-schengen . 
  i am sorry but your country still takes checks at the cash register . 
  checks !!!!, 
  also , your internet is shit compared to europe 's . 
  nice bait , though . 
  7.5 / 10 , made me reply . 
  the official language is polish but we have the silesian dialect ( i hear rumors of attempts being made to have it qualified as its own language who do n't need no man ) and kashubian ( kaszubski ) . 
  there are other dialects but silesian and kashubian are two that i know of off the top of my head . 
  but it 's not an eu member state as of right now , 
  italy for the food . 
  somewhere in the uk for the bants and english . 
  have n't met too many scots or been there ( my currency is too poor to go vacationing in scotland imho ... ), 
  everyone !, 
  australia who ? 
  i was kidding , you know :p, 
  lived in the us so american english , the only relevant english :p thanks for the downvotes , apparently banter is still much for r/askeurope . 
  our propensity to either be lickboots towards other countries or we outright hate other countries .
