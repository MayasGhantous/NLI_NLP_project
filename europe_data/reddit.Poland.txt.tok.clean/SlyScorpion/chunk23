  germany the state ( the average german is alright in my book ) and their media . 
  every time i watch some of their news reports about poland they seem to take on this weird patriarchial attitude towards us or maybe i am just interpreting it that way . 
  take this for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci-dr92hxxg, 
  including each other !, 
  staying alive by the beegees . 
  mi\u015b - ( known as `` teddy bear '' in english ) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082755/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl dzie\u0144 \u015bwira - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330243/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2 seksmisja - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088083/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1, 
  as someone who lived there for 20 + years , it 's like a circus for me . 
  give this man a potato !, 
  oh wait , our subsidized farmers stopped growing those ... 
  poland the eu-sceptic country . 
  our judicial system . 
  judges should be elected by the people not appointed by the political elite !, 
  hon hon hon !, 
  do n't consider us russians ... 
  should make a movie about that ... `` i was a teenage vegetarian ! '', 
  even americans can say `` bonjour '' so no excuse !, 
  did you meet them outside of queue land , though ? 
   if invited to someone 's home in a private setting - not bringing a small present . 
  we call that `` krzywy ryj '' here . 
  means `` cheapskate '' in a way and it 's most definitely a faux pas around these parts . 
  not taking a glove off before shaking hands with someone even if it is -40 degrees celsius . 
  good to know . 
  and on the other side , you have jaruzelski with his martial law in warsaw , communism in general , and being jaruzelski ... 
  yes , thank god i am not one ... imagine the horror of not being able to enjoy the local cuisine just because it has some meat in it , 
  what if the person it 's being offered to is a vegetarian ? 
  then what ? 
  same here . 
  if you 're in a tram and you suddenly hear a violin or an accordion being played , then keep a close eye on your wallet and such because after the person playing said instrument is done , they will go around and try get money out of people . 
  do keep in mind that our bums have some basic knowledge of english and will try to get money from you regardless . 
  do not give them anything . 
  football pretty much . 
  could kill for a good actually italian lasagne . 
  and our fabulously gray rainbows ... 
  they 're probably trying to get to richer eu countries / s, 
  funny ... now go to gulag !, 
  my god , man !, 
  a german unoccupied by streams of simulator games is a worrying thing indeed !, 
  they might actually do ... * something *, 
  he 's most likely a mod . 
  vegetarian cyclist communism !, 
  best yodelers in extended europe :d, 
  webster 's also disagrees with you : https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rightism https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/leftism, 
  man , i wish i was rich enough to get to hide money in sunny places . 
  be rich and spite others ? 
  where do i sign up ? 
   leftist or leftism google disagrees with you : https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=leftist+or+leftism&amp;ei=f6nrwiare8hu6asw15waag, 
  `` village '' is sometimes used in place of `` small town '' in common everyday english , 
  just substitute `` the germans '' for `` the jews '' and you 'll have the basic conspiracy nut in pl . 
  lived in a small town for a short time , still saw vietnamese people, 
  conspiracy nuts are everywhere , we are n't safe from them simply by the virtue of being polish ... would be nice , though . 
  hmmmm , thanks , i 'll read up n it , then . 
  learn to goose step so you can be a right proper nazi . 
  back to the salt mines with you !, 
   teh nasty gurrmans or they just blame russia for everything else ... 
   it 's according to population  small countries get overrepresented and large countries underrepresented should n't the last bit i quoted be the other way around then ? 
  r/evilbuildings is leaking, 
  could you explain , in the context of this thread , what do you mean by `` nasty stuff '' ? 
  all i am asking is for a concrete point or two as to why you think switzerland is a parasite . 
  `` nasty stuff '' can mean anything from polluting the environment to money laundering ... 
  if you have a body that can be thrown into the gulag , you can go to the gulag . 
  could you at least state why you think switzerland is a `` parasite '' , to use your own word ? 
  how is it a parasite ? 
  no , that 's the russians . 
  no offence taken . 
  just wanted to note that while we did have some really bad history in the past i hope that we can work together now ... 
   mario is italian he 's japanese and i 've never seen an italian like mario . 
  no , i have n't met every single italian alive ... 
  pretty women poland and ukraine have a lot of history together , some good , some ... not so good . 
  they 're our number 1 immigrants . 
  seriously , you may think you have talked to a polish person on your trip but surprise !, 
  it was a ukrainian in disguise all along !, 
  you 're thinking of unicycles , though . 
  better to just recycle the materials from the bikes ... 
  i upvoted you because what you described happened here to a t. 
  humans do n't breed well in captivity ... 
  needs more investment ... 
  should be `` i 'm going to fire my feta up your backside '' tbh ... 
  [ you mean like this ? 
  ] ( https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/files/2014/06/punch_rhodes_colossus-1.png ), 
  [ a tale of two polands ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ar46ju.png ) ( also i ca n't draw for shit in gimp ... seriously ... if i have to think more than 5 seconds on how to draw a straight line in a tool then forget it , it 's shit . ), 
  it still has some leftovers from april fool 's mixed in with the serious stuff , at least for me it appears as such . 
  alright the timer is down to 5 minutes again it seems ... 
  always . 
  1000 liters of meelk !, 
  for those of you not in the know , i 'd like to present [ ucho prezesa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucggq3qvorrm2u9grl7omofa ) ( the chairman 's ear ) headed by the main guy behind one of our largest comedy groups : kabaret moralnego niepokoju ( not sure how to translate that one properly ) . 
  these episodes basically poke fun at jaroslaw kaczynski and the way he `` holds court '' as the chairman of pis . 
  oh and the guy who is always waiting outside his door is supposed to be our current president andrzej duda :d edit : most , if not all , of the videos should have english subtitles ... 
  man , if reincarnation is real , i want to be born a rich kid so i do n't have to work hard for anything . 
  did it this life and i do n't feel any better about it ... 
  poles too . 
  i worked with plenty of germans and they were always the nicest of people without being fake about it . 
  maybe it 's just when they are tourists ? 
  oh man , i am sorry you had to get solicited for that . 
  that annoying shit happens in warsaw where i live and i am * this * close to just start yelling `` bugger off ya whores ! '', 
  at the girls soliciting but they 're probably just trying to earn some money like everyone else is ... 
  it 's a weird expression like so : `` fuckin ' a , did you see the match last night ? '', 
  i think he means the continentals ... 
  how about `` pizzled '' ? 
  irish need not ~ ~ apply ~ ~ spend the night ? 
   violent home invasions everyone is apparently so afraid about with a straight face when such things just do n't happen in poland poland is a magical place where no one ever experiences a violent home invasion .
