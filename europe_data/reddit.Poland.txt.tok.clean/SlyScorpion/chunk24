  sorry but i do n't buy that . 
  also , you stated earlier `` it 's the job of the government to provide security '' so am i supposed to have a government employee living in my home then ? 
   i expect germany to gift `` gift '' in german means `` poison '' just so you know ... 
  great . 
  i live in a one room apartment , no place to hide . 
  let 's hope the police arrive in time before the criminal sees me in the one room ... 
  so what happens when someone breaks into your home and you have no means of defending yourself ? 
  criminals and people with the intent to kill do not care how regulated the guns are , this will only adversely affect the law-abiding citizens . 
  and if a criminal breaks into your house is the police going to just magically appear to take them away ? 
  i 'd rather have the ability to defend myself if it ever comes to that kind of situation instead of relying on the government . 
   tfw you get so drunk you leave your declaration of independence ~ ~ behind the couch ~ ~ in berlin, 
  the eu needs its own version of the nra but i am not sure something like that will work in the eu due to the different attitudes , from my experience , towards guns in europe . 
  on a continent far , far away ... 
  tusk is all like `` bye , bitch ! '', 
  on this day we 're all nazis ... waitaminute ... 
  excuse me , mr. spanish person ... 
  in 9 months he will give birth to another landlord ... 
  let the interesting times begin ... 
  ukrainians and vietnamese . 
  sorry , i keep forgetting about `` afera '' = `` scandal '' :d, 
  27 to 1 you mean ? 
  or am i missing the joke ? 
  it was a partial joke , relax , 
  even `` people of color `` either laugh at the label or despise it . 
  it 's sjw speak . 
  we would love to be part of that club but as of right now , we still have the coal monkey on our backs : /, 
  all too true for me . 
  but not the sebixes ... 
  playing devil 's advocate here but why should they be ? 
  english is one of the most commonly spoken languages in the eu ... 
  depends on how you view `` best '' . 
  i know a lot of our college graduates go to work abroad so there 's that ... 
  unless i am mistaken , most of these road construction projects are given via tenders where the government puts out a missive that it needs x amount of roads built and companies can bid to get that contract . 
  iirc , the last time we had the affair with our roads the contract was given to a chinese company initially ... 
  edit : nevermind in any case , we do n't have the full letter , which i already stated in my previous comment but go ahead , keep on thinking that i am blindly accepting this as 100 % fact . 
  '' '' '' '' '' '' `` face '' '' '' '' '' '' '', 
  yes , `` the people do their thing , the government does its thing '' ( `` lud swoje , pa\u0144stwo swoje '' ), 
   poland clashing with poland yes , the civil war continues . 
  also , we do n't need `` foreign intervention '' , we can destroy ourselves just fine : /, 
  btw , if you attempt to read the article more than once it hits you with a paywall . 
  i clicked twice and on the second time i was asked to subscribe for money . 
   he 'll be off to see what falls off trumps table . 
  i thought he was already doing this ? 
  poland : even the immigrants that emigrate to poland do n't stay here :d, 
  i 'm a pole who lived in the us for a long time and moved back to poland and i 'd rather be here than in the us ... 
  * maybe * for consumables but not for everything . 
  `` western europe prices , eastern europe earnings '' is the motto for living outside of western europe . 
  i was attempting to play devil 's advocate with the third part of my comment . 
  i personally do n't have a problem with germans . 
   quoting a letter to springer staff by the corporation 's head mark dekan , poland 's tvp public broadcaster informed that springer journalists have been instructed to write `` instructed '' sounds like he told them what to do . 
   beata mazurek , spokesperson for poland 's ruling party law and justice ( pis ) , called the situation `` scandalous '' and said it proved germany 's intent to interfere in polish internal affairs . 
  and what i described earlier has actually happened , i.e. 
  someone takes this letter as `` germans are interfering with us again reeeee ! '' . 
  lastly , the article does n't have the whole letter , just long quotes from it so it could anyone 's guess as to what is really in that letter ... 
   almost all hypermarket and supermarket chains in poland are foreign-owned yes , even the ones that have polish names are foreign-owned . 
  \u017babka , a chain of convenience stores , is owned by a portuguese company . 
  i can look out my window right now and see a carrefour ( french company for those not in the know ) and just about every other store is foreign-owned . 
  the article states that he 's pretty much ordering polish journalists to write critical things about the polish government . 
  now , i am all for criticizing our current government because it deserves it but one should not `` ordain '' what journalists write about and how they write about it in their own countries , in my humble opinion . 
  also , you have someone german telling his polish employees to express his preferred views and that kind of thing plays into the far right 's hands as they can point at it and go `` see , the germans are telling us what to do ! '', 
  no , he is insane . 
  he 's currently claiming that tusk 's recent appointment as president of the eu council is literally fake news and that he 's got `` expert opinions '' about this . 
  including the poles ... 
  mcd is actually good in poland . 
  i mean it 's still mcd but it 's really good here ... 
  now you can be `` women-hating racist socialists who steal jewelry from people '' thanks to bernie sanders ... 
  they probably expected croatia to resemble bratislava from euro trip ... 
  does u2 count as a boy band ? 
  at least we still have waterford crystal ... right ? 
  it 's missing the proper hand gestures , though . 
  swede in a kilt with an adidas tracksuit and riding a grizzly ... 
  nah , would n't happen . 
  i lived in the us for a time , which can kind of be described using your words , and each state had its own traditions , culture , accents , and more . 
  hell , even within a given state you 'd have traditions and customs that occurred in only one county within a given state . 
  tl ; dr it might not be as bad as you think , 
   george zimmerman he was n't even a cop , he was a guy in the neighbourhood watch or something like that . 
  i am not sure it 's a good thing to put the eu flag on a representative of an empire built on conquest and slavery , though . 
  tell that to the ukrainians that come to poland all the time . 
  what those countries do n't want is to have to forcibly house people who are dead set on getting to western europe . 
  man , if you only heard the things kaczynski said about immigrants and yet , he 's still not arrested by some eu police ... 
  elect people who will change the laws ? 
  i do n't know what you 've read or heard , i just know that a lot of poles are in favor of the eu . 
  now i see what you mean . 
  i like how it 's in alphabetical order ... 
  you mean that really large spanish state ? 
  / s * ducks *, 
  most poles aka the average citizens do n't hate the eu , it 's our current ruling party that is eternally butthurt about the eu . 
  that rule is no longer in effect in r/polandball ... 
  ftfy, 
  `` gulp '' but in portuguese ? 
  i , for one , wish we could move beyond needing to lay cable and have unlimited lte + internet with monthly fees . 
  i think it might eliminate those issues where people who are just outside a given region are stuck with shitty internet options . 
  i think the polish version is a reference to [ these magazine covers ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/ba/8d/12/z19455930ih,okladki--wprost--i--wsieci-.jpg ) . 
  it was czechoslovakia then , was n't it ? 
  and that 's up to the czechs to say , i guess , since they were n't in the su themselves ...

  the pic makes it hard to tell .
