  what classes ? 
  as long as there is incontrovertible evidence of a crime then yes , i see it as a good thing . 
  so can we leave the anti-immigrant club now ? 
  do n't mention bandera or anything like that and it 's ok ... 
  oh yay so we go from one pile of shit ( pis ) to another ( po ) but hey , at least the outside world likes po more than pis so there 's that ... 
  same here sort of ... 
  we 're not talking about non-eu countries as their nationals do not have freedom of movement within the eu ... 
  i thought it was the legal ee/ce immigration that was the tipping point ? 
  i certainly hear a lot of `` well , since millions of poles emigrated to the uk they are a factor in brexit '' statements here and there . 
  sure we do but the majority of cars being used in poland are german made . 
  citizens of eu countries are covered by freedom of movement . 
  they did n't make the law that allows them to freely move to and live in another member state . 
  with a side of fries-a fries-a ... 
  hi , it 's our government that 's conservative . 
  people are actually rather liberal in the big cities of poland . 
  do an adult crime , serve adult time . 
  seriously , 17 is damned old enough to know what the hell one is doing . 
  well , warsaw has two sides and it has a rather large outer border . 
  it houses 1.7 million people and covers an area about 517 square kilometers as seen here : https://www.google.pl/maps/place/warsaw/@52.2538385,20.9128526,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x471ecc669a869f01:0x72f0be2a88ead3fc!8m2!3d52.2296756!4d21.0122287 yes , warsaw has districts such as the praga district , wola district , and others . 
  if you scroll in on that map you should see the district names pop up . 
  also , the surrounding areas kind of feed into warsaw a little bit so the actual border is slightly larger ... kind of ... 
  article 50 is not triggered at this time so they are , technically , still in the club . 
  i 've lived in places where you 'd see 1970 's cars spew as much black smoke as a diesel full sized truck ... and they were gasoline-fueled cars . 
  22,000 in warsaw city hall according to u/marchewajp https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5y77ic/bucharest_city_hall_has_860_employees_berlin_city/deo7jzd/, 
  i do n't know if it 's fake news , if it 's a setup by someone with an agenda but [ when you see pictures like this ] ( https://twitter.com/erikalmqvist/status/638287628903841792 ) it kind of makes you think ... 
  [ one theory on the subject ... ] ( https://petapixel.com/2013/09/23/didnt-people-smile-old-photos/ ), 
  yes , enough with the revolutions , please , or at least contain them next time :p, 
   proletarian revolution no , thank you . 
  the last one had russia occupying poland for 45 years :p, 
  but this is n't about ukrainian oligarchs , though . 
  also , is russia bringing , or going to be bringing , freedom and democracy to ukraine ? 
  maybe russia should stop doing what 's causing the west to apply sanctions ? 
  i do n't know but i doubt that the west placed those sanctions simply because of russophobia ... 
  ca n't even ask a question anymore without someone getting asspained about it :d, 
  i do n't see north korea grabbing land in south korea recently ... 
  good point but can we be sure that most of them hear the message from the outside world or do they just tune in to the putinganda of their own accord and tune out the rest ? 
  ahh ok , i have n't been keeping up with all of trump 's antics . 
  in any case , in my original post , i was simply stating that nature , as in old age or something of the sort , take its course just in case someone thinks i am implying anything different . 
  good luck with that , europe is scared of guns , for the most part , otherwise there would be a us-style right to bear arms europe-wide . 
  dude , i really do n't care . 
  all i was doing was asking a question even if it is one about a rather sensitive topic . 
  paleolithic cheeks can bend steel beams !, 
  hmmm ? 
  i know russia can have internet inside the country , i am talking about access to the internet outside of russia . 
  one can always be drafted ... 
  yes , those damned homophones ... 
  why not just block russia 's internet access ? 
  bet you 'd have a riot if people ca n't access the net at all ... 
  there 's always natural causes and , no , i am not implying anything . 
  [ you mean like this ? 
  is that how german comedians are made ? 
  `` unelected bureaucrats are screwing the country ! '', 
  `` umm nigel , we elected these guys ... '' '' ... '', 
  this one kinda is ...

  stephen hawking has no chill , does he ? 
  admit it op , you just wanted to have a `` my girlfriend '' post at least once in your life :p, 
  ca n't prove a negative ... 
  thanks !, 
   sag what 's that ? 
  i highly doubt voltaire was * that * liberal/enlightened/libertine / not sure which word to use here  . , 
  flag czechs out ... 
  13c is practically t-shirt weather ... 
  gon na need a burn unit for this one !, 
  please keep them , we still have some left over :p, 
  your flatmate sounds like an anomaly , not because i am biased due to being polish but because women here go to great lengths to be very presentable on average . 
  hell , my gf wo n't leave to go to the store without doing * something * make-up related before leaving ... 
  what if someone makes an eu-wide law about it ? 
  something something pineapple something something violates ordnung ... 
  many such cases !, 
  sad !, 
  considering the fact that their diet might not have been all that great ( not saying the modern diet is any better ... ) she still looks decent ... 
   charities and fundraisers operated by the church such as caritas , right ? 
  last i heard caritas was one of those charities ... 
  would the same company count ? 
  some companies pay more or less for their managers although it might be difficult to gauge with smaller companies that might not have or need that many managers ... 
  in politburo gulag . 
  you 're still not getting `` danzig '' back ... 
   why are polish cities written in german ? 
  rightful german clay / s, 
  the beta version of the polish corridor ? 
  some specifics , please . 
  i am certain there are certain groups they are against that are coming in with the latest immigration waves that they are voting against ... 
  the last message was a cry for help , actually . 
  send help , polish women bad ... * end transmission *, 
  no ordnung whatsoever ... none !, 
  man , it sounds like she 's playing you and the other guy . 
  plenty of women out there , no need to get hung up on one and only one . 
  enough to pay the funeral costs ? 
   either men have it worse or women are just not competent enough to kill themselves . 
  true . 
  edit : wrong words removed ... 
  `` where am i going to get 50 tiny damn people to play human chess with now !? '', 
  you have no room to talk , italy / s, 
  you mean misandrist ? 
  it 's fucking cold and there 's shit all to do ? 
  just a guess though ... 
  men are more likely to be successful at any suicide attempts ( probably due to the methods used ) and they 're less likely to talk about it afaik .
