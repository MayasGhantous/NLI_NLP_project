  donald trump is n't a republican , he 's just running as a republican to avoid being marginalized as a third-party candidate , i think .

  i am no expert on this topic but there may have been jewish collaborators or something of the sort . 
  googling the term `` jewish nazis '' is troublesome because you ca n't readily tell which sources are from the alt-right if you do n't already know about which is which .
