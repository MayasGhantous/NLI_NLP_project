  did he also create the chess * pieces * ? 
   kazamierez are you referring to kazimierz by any chance ? 
  we 're germany 's number one market for their used beamers , volkswagens , and other brands . 
  and no , i am not talking about car theft , people buy used german cars around here . 
  they 're not ~ ~ sending ~ ~ writing their best ... 
   not occupying all 10 spots shamefur dispray !, 
  also , the staff of the restaurant is powerless since they usually number in the 20s for a medium restaurant and if you have 160 people set on stealing meals , they outnumber you ... 
  show me on the doll where the bad halva touched you . 
  coming soon to a uk near you : slavchavs !, 
  i was all like `` you lucky bastard ! '', 
  but then i saw the flag in the upper left ... 
  you are practically slavic economy-wise so enjoy it , you 've earned it :p,

   kaelkirjak someone was drunk when they made this one up , right ? 
  ok , so i hear about le pen and breaking up the eu but it 's not like she can just flip a switch to get france out of the eu . 
  certainly there exists some check to stop her from doing so if in office ? 
  this is the outfit that gets you killed in the praga district of warsaw ... 
  you mean they have n't built a base on the moon already ? 
  failures of efficiency , i guess ... 
  good , let 's see where this leads to . 
  [ relevant `` kieubasa '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhlehi8faho ), 
  tusk could cure cancer , solve the grand unified theory and he 'd still get shit from kaczynski . 
  they are very much political rivals . 
  as long as i can suggest to the suggesters of these words that they can fuck right off with their suggestions , i 'm cool with it . 
  it 's the moment where i am forced to use certain words that 's when we have a problem . 
  i have never heard anyone use the term `` woman doctor '' , it 's always been `` doctor '' ... 
  the idiocy lies in the suggesting people use different words . 
  i , for one , do not care to have some busybodies attempt regulate my speech . 
  this may sound like the slippery slope fallacy but first it starts with a suggestion and then moves to being enforced . 
   personal interest in service how is that in sweden in general ? 
  i mean what 's the average swede 's attitude towards the armed forces ? 
  also , thanks for the insightful comment , btw . 
  he wants the jerbs for himself hence the request for secrecy :p, 
  i like the one about the oscars :d, 
  man , i am not an expert but i am not sure conscription is the way to go . 
  people who are forced to be there will not be as effective as a proper volunteer army ... 
  maybe but if you see the kind of candidates we get every time , you 'd see why people feel like voting is not doing anything . 
  man , i would love for some of the people in this thread to see a `` ladies ' night '' in a lot of bars in some places in the world ... 
  i do n't think you can post daily mail links in this subreddit without your comment getting deleted by the automod ... 
  using public transport ?!?!, 
  mccarthy must be rolling in his grave !, 
   tfw you have the best of both worlds : citizenship in an eu country and an american passport, 
  i see lots of obama and `` slush fund '' posts on there ... 
  because they have merkel ? 
  poor guy probably had the initial symptoms of a swollen prostate from what you describe . 
  well , there * is * portuguese-br but i get what you 're saying ... 
   polandia that 's my personal nickname for my country :p, 
  no one bothers to vote because there 's no one worth voting for in poland , at least from the candidates that actually run . 
  seriously , some of our politicians have been on the scene since the late 80s , a small select few were in the former communist party , and the new people that do come in are just absolutely not worth voting for . 
   people feel that they ca n't change much so they do n't vote . 
  is pretty much the reason we have low voter turnout . 
  perhaps the voter turnout is abysmal because we have an abysmal political class ? 
  not like we have much of a choice , we 're right next door to germany and a stone 's throw away from russia . 
  history taught us much about those two countries ...

  any clay is good clay , imho :p, 
  after korwin-mikke 's little `` spectacle '' , it 's rather difficult to defend ourselves about anything anymore . 
  i did and i was stating the sources from u/johnklotter 's comment were inconclusive to me to which he agreed in his response to me . 
  all i am asking for is direct proof that schulz actually said `` for me , the new germany exists only in order to ensure the existence of the state of israel and the jewish people . '' everything so far is of the `` he told me this in private conversation '' variety . 
  ok so the first part is something someone else attributes to him after a private conversation , the second quoted part does n't even mention the exact phrase , just acknowledges the past ... not saying the sources you provide are bad but the evidence is inconclusive , imho . 
  `` bread with some non-bready bits on it '', 
  i keep hearing this being attributed to schulz but did he really say it ? 
  any audio proof or something ? 
  i sure as fuck did not vote for him ... 
  are you referring to the polish plumber/electrical engineer janusz `` nikola '' teslaczyszczykiewicz ? 
  or the cleaners are just doing their thing ... 
  any guarantee he 'll actually do anything or is he spouting hot air like most candidates do when promising to `` clean up politics '' ? 
  aka we 're not spain ? 
  i read that , without google , as `` you have betrayed us !, 
  you are a heretic ! '', 
  how far off am i ? 
  you 're about 250 years too late , sverige :p, 
  yep , that 's a poland . 
  you mean moobs ? 
  well , i was mostly trying to point out that it might be better to focus on the positive aspects of europe rather than have something negative on the banner . 
  and still no potato for latvia ... 
  it 's better for the surgeon , certainly :p apologies if this reply comes off in a bad light , curse the limits of a text-only medium , but your evidence is anecdotal but i also have n't offered any hard proof to any of my arguments either . 
  lastly , i * did * try to find some sort of studies to prove that , perhaps , not everything is roses but , alas , they are either paywalled or they add the discrimination bit whereas i was looking for strictly internal factors , such as a person 's self-perception after transitioning . 
  works for me , gracias !, 
  i 'd rather see [ gender dysphoria ] ( https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria ) treated in a way that the person suffering from it does not need to resort to the kind of surgery that is used to `` fix '' the problem . 
  that poster 's message is aimed at society 's most impressionable members : children . 
  i 'd rather that message be aimed at adults who can at least make up their own minds about it . 
  well , i 'd like to avoid running into that kind of situation where you think you 're with a woman but that person is actually a man . 
  oil and gas money ? 
   martyr do n't you have to be a bit on the dead side to be one of those ? 
  ah this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galicia_ ( eastern_europe ), 
  why do they keep thinking you 're from poland ? 
   how is the ass-towel thing organized in a family ? 
  initials sewn onto the towel ? 
  ru paul is a transvestite rather than a transgendered person aka drag queen iirc . 
  i * could * be wrong , though . 
  what pseudo-science am i spreading ? 
  since you edited your comment , i 'll edit mine :p that 's fine but i 'd like to ask the other side to stop spreading things like this then http://imgur.com/a/3zi3s, 
  it 's not outrageous , no , but that does n't mean i 'll celebrate the existence of what is considered to be a disorder either . 
  hence the reason i said `` mathematically '' not `` socially '' . 
  also , human biology is simple ( in a manner of speaking because of course the human organism is rather complex ) : there are two sexes and two pairs of chromosomes . 
  anything other than that is considered to be a disorder and not by me but by the medical profession itself . 
  i 'm fine if they identify themselves as transgender , it 's when they try to `` pass '' that 's where i draw the line because , frankly , i do n't like being lied to . 
  10 tendies/hour ? 
  i need to eat both to be sure .
