  thank you for the pizza !, 
  damn , i am too late . 
  have an upvote . 
  damn , i 'd rather look at the hawaiian pizza , to be honest ( sorry italy !, 
   commission outlines 5 scenarios for future of eu in white paper is the title slightly editorialized or is it just me ? 
  the europe one has the nice hint of resentment with trump crossed out . 
  at least murrica just focuses on , well , murrica and they do n't have a crossed out merkel :p, 
  we 're not relevant enough to have declared rivals : /  tfw irrelevant in eu , irrelevant in euiv, 
  either a ) they do n't know about reddit or b ) they 're stating quiet in r/europe since theirs is not a generally popular candidate or c ) they express their views in strictly francophone subreddits rather than one where english is the * lingua franca * . 
  that 's actually a genetic disorder when someone has an xxy chromosome : https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/klinefelter-syndrome  a lot of people have penis and ovaries or vulva and testicles aka hermaphrodites and afaik there are n't that many around . 
  `` mawwage '' like in princess bride :d, 
  i am sorry but if a person has a penis , an xy chromosome pair , produces a lot more testosterone than estrogen , then they 're still male no matter what . 
  cool , thank you for the logical explanation , it 's all i ever really wanted :d, 
  if having the leg is somehow objectively beneficial ( adds to the flavour or something like that ) then i am all for it . 
  so may i ask why is it `` hugely important '' in this case ? 
  when it comes to coffee , italy gets transported to an alternate dimension , i guess . 
  i am quite certain one can have the quality without the unnecessary , in my opinion , inedible parts . 
  well , it 's mostly dependent on whether the meat in question is sold by weight or whether there 's a set price for such a particular portion . 
  if i am going to pay by weight then i 'd like to not pay for the weight of the hoof/bone/other inedible part :p, 
  oh , does the hoof at the end confer some flavor ? 
  i like my ham without hooves ... 
  but i already do that :d, 
  more like coffee.zip , a compressed version of coffee ... 
  if it does n't gain sentience , it 's not strong enough !, 
  it 's the fact that the meat is breaded and then has sauce put on top of it which makes the breading soggy . 
  for some people , it 's not just the taste that 's important but also the texture of the food , 
  don quixote was a fine example of portuguese literature . 
  true story . 
  at this point it 's just a chunk of meat with some breading !, 
  and the potatoes out ? 
  some places in poland will do the sunny side up egg but not the sauce ... 
  price dumping is as bad as protectionism , though .

  i never put ketchup on the schnitzel but i will have some on the side . 
  i do n't know why but where i work the local eatery puts an egg sunny side up on their schnitzel like [ this ] ( http://previews.123rf.com/images/maxsheb/maxsheb1401/maxsheb140100703/25129587-wiener-schnitzel-with-egg-stock-photo.jpg ),

  * could have, 
  yeah , that i did . 
  in my country you have to register even those and i believe this is an eu-wide thing but i am not 100 % sure . 
  i could 've sworn there was some law about it . 
  all i know is that i had to register my two pre-paid sim cards or otherwise the company that owns them would simply render the number on them inoperable . 
  afaik and i am not a lawyer but do n't you have to register the sim card with your name and address and , thus , negating any privacy you might think you have ? 
  we have electricity stands ? 
  charging nooks ? 
  not sure what to call them but they 're these little lockers where you can pay some money while in the mall , store the phone , and have it charged while you shop .

  i do n't to revisit `` reglamentacja '' again ... 
  led by an austrian . 
  and then they had a civil war about 100 years later ... 
  only if we can figure out a fiscal/financial ( use the appropriate term here , i guess ) policy where we do n't have a situation like greece 's ( seemingly ) threatening the stability of the eu . 
  look at the us , florida tends to be a state that tends to take more than it gives into the pot yet the us is n't seeing the same situation like we are with greece ... not sure if i made myself clear but i hope my meaning got across ... 
  aka supranationalism , i think ...
