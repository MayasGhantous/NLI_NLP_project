  i said `` our '' aka polish :p, 
  yes . 
  are you saying praga has all the football hooligans in warsaw ? 
  besides , lots of other places have been decimated before by hooligans outside of praga . 
  ~ ~ no separate album art for portugal . 
  tsk tsk ~ ~ nevermind , it 's just hard to see since spain 's almost perfectly blends with it ... 
  if europe keeps taking all those smart people , how are their home countries going to be improved , if at all ?

  at least we use ours :p every french word contains omitted vowels when spoken , at least that 's how it sounds when i compare subtitles to the spoken word ...

  natural reflex when you 're polish ? 
  i do n't know . 
  fuck off , you triggered little snowflake . 
  and what are my favoured parties ? 
  because last time i checked i hated all of our parties . 
  listen , bitch and froth at the mouth all you want , i really do n't care . 
  get some `` dystans '' for once in your life . 
  no one outside of poland should be inflicted with having to learn polish . 
  fake language . 
  i do n't know about other countries but poland should not have nukes . 
  why ? 
  because we have too many crazies in our government and we always tend to elect a few crazies . 
  the same allies that threw us to the soviets in yalta . 
  i just watched a video by shadiversity on the whole sword vs. katana thing and he compared , loosely i might add , the longsword to a pc and the katana to a console . 
  the longsword = multifunctional , many variations . 
  the katana = focuses on one thing and does it well .

  lithuania bitched the whole time ... 
  i ca n't believe that is a thing ... 
  i read elsewhere that , at the time , they had such shitty materials that the whole `` folded 10,000 times '' meme was actually an attempt to reinforce the weapon to not break if someone breathed on it . 
  not a blacksmith or anything so take what i say with a grain of salt . 
  we had 8 years of him , you keep him :p, 
  if he 's inviting all these people from other countries , how is he going to keep the place `` ethnically clean '' ? 
  one would think that someone going on ethno-nationalism would rather be more `` hungary first , fuck off to the rest of you !, 
  that 's true . 
  but it 's difficult to tell in a thread about a sweden and `` no-go zones '' since we are limited to text without body language and tone . 
  double negatives do not apply on hyphenated words and/or quoted ones . 
  get the pasta cannone ready !, 
  ah right , did n't see that at the time ... 
  we signed a non-proliferation treaty for whatever reason ...

  your fancy clothes betray you !, 
  many such cases , it 's true !, 
  sad !, 
  oh , the vietnamese changed colors this time of the year ? 
  you mean * foreign * food ?!?!, 
  the vietnamese invaders , on the other hand , truly a menace to behold . 
  big / s just in case my comment gets misconstrued ... 
  if they have a flair it should show up as text next to their username . 
  for example , i see `` white british male '' next to your username on my tablet . 
  ahhh but was it a [ gay fish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vn2xrsg24w ) ? 
  hence my original clarification because i am certain the situation was n't so clear cut ( `` no , you ca n't come because you are a non-muslim '' ) . 
  maybe it 's just the words `` state of emergency '' . 
  why is it there and can it be scaled down to `` state of heightened awareness '' or something like that ? 
  they still probably found a way to segregate them anyways . 
  women on the right , men on the left or something like that ... 
   when they arrange something they only include muslims seems like they choose to alienate themselves , if that statement is to be believed ... 
  does n't the fertility rate drop off after a generation or two ? 
  someone once mentioned that in this subreddit a while ago and they had the statistics to prove thier porint ... 
  people travel , view the news that comes from other countries so their view is shaped by what they either saw personally or saw on the news . 
  since the media like to focus on incidents such as charlie hebdo or the truck incident to quite an extent ( we 're talking about bombardment with articles and videos ) , it 's no surprise that , perhaps , some people when questioned said `` nah , we do n't want any of that ! '' . 
  i do n't think the average pole would have an issue with muslims if there was a sensible immigration policy that focused on a ) controlled immigration from outside of the eu b ) efforts made to integrate new arrivals instead of just letting them clump together into poor neighbourhoods and fomenting resentment and alienation . 
  we can always go with czechy :p, 
  just read the article and i have one question : would n't the removal of gay marriage have to go through a vote or something ? 
  i mean you ca n't just go `` right , no more of that from this day forth ! '', 
  can you ? 
  `` it 'll be different this time ! '', 
  we were discussing children and you make it about wives for no reason . 
  i am not talking like a rapist , you 're simply projecting that onto me because i dare to come at this issue from an opposing side and you seem to think that i am advocating random , senseless violence . 
  besides , a spanking is not a beating they way i think you 're imagining it .
