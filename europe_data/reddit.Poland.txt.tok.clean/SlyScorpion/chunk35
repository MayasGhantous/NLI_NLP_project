   even though there are scumbags and scoundrels in the polish gov and ruling party ftfy they 're all dirty and corrupt . 
  got ta love political immunity , right ? 
  san escobar 's greatest ally . 
  did they say `` he was asking for it '' and `` he fell on top of it '' too ? 
  he strikes me as an arrogant europhile whose solution for everything is `` more europe ! '', 
  but then again i am mistrustful of all bureaucrats and politicians so take my opinion with a pillar or two of salt . 
  just because there 's a simple explanation for politics and politicians does not mean it 's wrong . 
  think what you like and i will think what i like . 
  no thank you . 
  please do n't tell me you actually think the politicians in any country work for the people ? 
  i am sorry but they are a self-serving species . 
  you say i twist the truth , where am i twisting it ? 
  look at the recent fiasco in france with sarkozy and fillon or even in romania where they tried to legalise corruption . 
  i am not sure if i am entirely comfortable with my country becoming a mere `` state '' , though . 
  folksdojcz-in-chief el donaldo tusko !, 
  you mean they are n't incompetent already ? 
  :p anyways , most governments are only competent at enriching those who work within the government , any beneficial effect that manages to somehow serve the people is merely a side effect . 
  as for experts going into government , well , that depends on whether they are even allowed to exercise their expertise or not . 
  because , from where i sit , they just become experts at enriching themselves once they enter government . 
  if they 've been involved in politics for a long while , they are part of the establishment . 
  hell , if they are politicians that qualifies them as such as well . 
  they establish the rules us plebs have to go by , right ? 
  nothing of importance happens in poland . 
  fake country . 
  you are fake polak if you dare to criticize ~ ~ dear leader ~ ~ jarokaczor !, 
  maybe it 's just me but i am kind of glad we do n't use the euro if we can avoid the shit that is going on with greece and such ... 
  i think it 's our history that plays a role . 
  we regained our independence in 1918 only to be forced into the soviet union after 1945 . 
  i am not trying to excuse us being an obstacle , just trying to see it from someone else 's point of view . 
  competition is good , though . 
  it 's what keeps things innovative . 
  i will agree that division is bad , however . 
  dear establishment , some of us never have and never will trust you . 
  we have the floridian economy so where 's the goddamn weather ? 
  hmmmmm ? 
  yaroswaffen : german edition . 
  russian spy detected !, 
  reeeeeeeee, 
  it 's actually catchy and funny :d, 
  definitely for the better . 
  the last time i was here you could be a millionaire with one bank note ( this was before the redenomination so around 1992 ) . 
  i came back from the usa and wild horses could n't drag me back there , to be frank . 
  yes , i make less money here than i would in the us but i make more than enough for polish living standards and could n't be happier . 
  i actually can put away money and not live from hand to mouth like i did in the usa . 
  i came back after so many years and man , poland 's changed a lot since the last time i was here ... 
  i remember the times when we had `` milicja '' instead of `` policja '' and even got to experience the `` jedzenie na kartki '' for a short time . 
  i was born in 1977 so i was rather naive about the martial law happening . 
  i did read up on it though . 
  did merkel grab jaros\u0142aw by the [ pussy ] ( http://muzeum4rp.iq.pl/wiki/images/a/a5/frywolne_zabawy.jpg ) ? 
  thanks but we had that in the 80s . 
  0/10 ign - would not play again . 
  she has to win the second round and , knowing the general attitude of the french posters in this subreddit , it 's highly likely that she will lose the second round . 
  ca n't be any worse than what we 've got going on now ... 
  no adidas stripes on the bear , it 's a polish bear . 
  the cattle ... 
   \u00f3 in polish that letter reads like `` u '' . 
  i have no idea why we have two letters that sound exactly the same . 
  it 's just `` polo '' :p reads like `` pulu '' to me :d, 
  dear diary , today i managed to trigger an icelander . 
  today was a good day . 
  ah so it 's a genetic/species preservation thing , i take it ? 
  the important question is : can you grab them by the pony though ? 
  what is the deal with the horses ? 
  moldavia first , iceland second ? 
  i think he/she meant `` shitstorm '' but got lost on the way :p, 
  maybe in some bizarro eu  . , 
  who evolved into [ gondola ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gondola ), 
  the finns only needed one meme to get international meme acclaim . 
  more efficient than the germans ... 
  because you are fake ~ ~ news ~ ~ country !, 
  soooo what about at least tarring and feathering the guy ? 
  not advocating violence ... just making sure they remember how much they fucked up ... 
  except ukraine  . , 
  i see . 
  i would still bar them if their actions or lack of action caused such a massive disruption in a given country . 
  is he barred forever from holding office too ? 
  it 's the only way to root corruption out , imho . 
  did you not see  the president of poland is supposed to hand in their membership of a party and be non-partisan the word `` supposed '' is in there for a reason ... 
  no , i wo n't say you 're wrong , it 's just that history is not that clear cut . 
  i am not sure where to point you towards proof that somewhat substantiates my claim but you may have better luck in r/askeurope if you ask about the solidarnosc movement , i am sure there are more poles in there that may know more than i do , 
   those polish flags in that thread cringe ... 
  [ you mean the pasta cannone ? 
  copying right-wing memes is low energy :p, 
   kaczynski controls parliament , president kaczynski holds no government post , he is a party leader . 
  he is not the prime minister . 
  also , the president of poland is supposed to hand in their membership of a party and be non-partisan so the president of poland is not under any party 's control . 
  you will find poland somewhat divided on the subject of the solidarnosc movement , actually . 
  you laugh now or pay denbts !, 
  sorry but the right-wing has much better memes than the left . 
  would eat it , no lie . 
  with ketchup on the slices !, 
  you mean like kaszubian and the like ? 
  hmmmm , somewhat but it depends on the individual speaker and the like since people tend to slur words or avoid pronouncing some letters . 
  [ gasps in norwegian ], 
  have you respected the robot today , citizen ? 
  \\ #notmymonarch, 
  we have r/polska and r/poland ... 
  \\ #altfacts, 
  it will be goed if you start now , je ... ( working on my dutchlish ... ), 
  why not have a poll about whether we should have polls .
