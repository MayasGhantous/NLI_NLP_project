  i think you 're trolling at this point due to the excessive amount of buzzwords . 
  [ yes , yes , you 're the good guys and all ... ] ( http://imgur.com/a/a80yl ), 
  yeah , afaik one should be derived from the other but i am no `` polonista '' :d, 
  you might be thinking of `` prostak '' or `` prostacki '' in that regard . 
  since the general populace is unarmed , the government thinks it can get away with shit like this . 
  stay strong romania !, 
  whenever i ate kraft mac & cheese i would put ketchup on it :d, 
  amazing !, 
  `` we grabbed them by the civil rights ! '', 
  yes , you 're rather * below * average are n't you ? 
  i certainly did . 
   germany germany germany germany for the humor part :d, 
  my little pony did nothing wrong !, 
  ( yes , i know the actual mlp you are referring to , of course  ), 
   even if they have committed no crime i have no words for this ... 
  heretic . 
  pistols at dawn . 
  i like the russian people , not a fan of the russian government though . 
  i 'm in warsaw and i eat my potato pancakes with sugar  . , 
  you should watch the movie `` mi\u015b '' ( teddy bear in englih ) if you want to see how ludicrous communism got in poland , 
  for facebook , in poland we have nasza klasa but it 's seen as kinda provincial nowadays and i ca n't recall the last time i heard someone used it ... 
  \\ #askingforit / s, 
  many such cases !, 
  coooooo ?!?!, 
  [ this article states otherwise ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/its-not-a-muslim-ban-trump-gives-no-sign-hell-back-down-on-executive-order-barring-refugees ) also , several muslim countries , including saudi arabia and jordan , are not on the list . 
  if it was a `` muslim ban '' then all muslim-majority countries would have been banned fo 90 days . 
  oops ... choroba filipinska  . , 
  lol , the `` filipino flu '' was a reference to one of our past presidents :d basically , our president , andrzej kwasniewski , was returning from the philippines and he was looking slightly drunk and he claimed it was a `` filipino flu '' to cover up the fact that he was probably drunk as a skunk :d [ filipino flu polish article ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/choroba-filipinska-doprowadzila-ole-kwasniewska-do-placzu,37192.html ), 
  he 's got the filipino flu , man !, 
  be nice !, 
  lol beata szydlo being shown alongside trump and wilders ? 
  really ? 
  if they have to resort to violence against people they disagree with , i will call them vile . 
  no excuses . 
  [ the author of the article ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jqsxt ), 
  your maple syrup is too expensive so no help for you ... 
  it was more than 20 kids and they were also attacking people going to the deploraball . 
  face it , the american antifa are vile and violent scum . 
  he was referring to the antifa who were `` protesting '' ( read : destroying private property ) on january 20th . 
  you need a z-snap for that . 
  well , it looks like an `` l '' but your `` i '' between `` should '' and `` even '' looks like it 's bolded for some reason ... 
   kleine bremsen sooo `` little brakes '' ? 
  is there no legitimate way the french people can ask for a different set of candidates ? 
  [ it 's not a muslim ban , please get this right ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html ), 
  i guess they like to pay with legos ... 
  [ bridges of europe !, 
  and forts !, 
  they 're vegetarians ? 
  especially since the politics and news are very depressing lately ... 
  man , if that were possible it would be so much easier to travel more . 
  i would n't care if it cost a bit a more but to be able to go somewhere and be there in such a short time ... 
  you have to date them first ... 
  if we ca n't keep germans from coming into our country we might as well make them regret they came here in the first place ... 
  one can easily google a proper uk address so it 's not that difficult ... 
  forts , castles , and now cattle ... 
  it looks like it 's waiting to mug someone . 
  according to what i 've read in this thread , if no one gets 50 % of the vote in the first round , the candidates with the most votes in the first round face off in the second round ... 
  man , i did n't label him as such , it 's in the headline . 
  and why the hell should i like socialists ? 
  they 're always willing to grab other people 's money like hamon himself is in this article : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38723219 besides , i am not young and i 've always hated socialists before it was cool :p, 
  noooo , that 's three years before the 2008 economic crisis ... 
  maybe she 's looking for a man who really likes pineapples . 
  you ca n't find those on tinder , you know . 
  is this how a woman catches a man in turkey by setting a pineapple as bait ? 
  those poor cows :( well , the ones in the picture look fat so i guess it 's a good sign , right ? 
  got ta love the leaf wreath . 
  not sure what it means but it looks like a sign of respect or is it just decoration ? 
  i feel like i need to take a whip , go through that castle and destroy candles while on my way to fight dracula ... 
  you mean fjords ? 
  this may be a dumb question but why are they abandoned ? 
  says the neutral fellow :p, 
  i do n't know ... you do n't appear sufficiently - phobic ( do fill in the blanks , there 's so many topics to be phobic about that i have n't the time to list them all ) . 
  can we trust you to mistreat minorities equally ? 
  ca n't go around treating one minority worse than another one , you know . 
  why , look at u/eatonlodes they 're showing some enthusiasm about the whole thing , can we say the same about you ? 
  hmmmm ? 
  well , i do n't agree with socialists myself so there 's that . 
  the flair killed me , 
  from the looks of it , scandals and more scandals ... 
  ok , thanks !, 
  ok , let me rephrase it : how are the poll numbers generated , for the lack of a better word ? 
  how do they know that a candidate will get x % of votes in a given round ? 
  the executive order that you 're thinking of never mentions muslims . 
  how are they getting these second round poll numbers , by the way ? 
  they 're not burger cattle , ` murrica !!, 
  made me laugh , thanks !, 
  looks ghostly with the black patches around the eyes and all ... 
  eastern germany , the country , no longer exists in a legal sense , though . 
  well , we would need 3 more countries besides yours and we could have v8 !, 
   at least we 'll be complete in v4 in being selfish , heartless racist ** misogynist ** xenophobes you got ta add that one too for full effect since it 's part of 2017 's set of buzzwords :p, 
  do n't hate the player , hate the game :p, 
  old habits tend to die hard . 
  how would you like to have your country , with its history , traditions , culture , folklore , etc , become nothing more than just a mere state ? 
  how would you react to that ? 
  get ready for round 2 of this : /, 
  no one has lived to tell the tale of how a bison burger tastes for it is rumored that the bison bites back !, 
  [ my husband used me as a plow !, 
  guess ol' google could n't translate it when used in a sentence . 
  i get `` deceiving '' when translating it on its own . 
  is that correct ?
