  how is that mocking , though ? 
  sounds more like a compliment ...

  [ those same hipsters can also destroy 400 jobs ] ( http://www.ernstmalmsten.com/ ), 
  blame the employers too since they did hire them for cheap .

  did n't we have to sell those off due to the enormous debt the filthy little commies ran up while in power or was it something else ? 
  we used to manufacture cars , we had shipyards ... no more !, 
  better than tearing it all down i say ... 
  well , good luck screening those sneaky little gypsies that are going to be riding on the romanians ' coattails ...

  i would hate for them to rust ... imagine the noise . . * screeeeee * * screeeeeeee * `` good lord , what 's that noise ? '', 
  `` ah just the romanians flying south for the winter ... '', 
  still not as bad as german with its masculine , feminine , and neuter articles ... 
  i am not an expert on the english language by any means but yeah , they do serve a purpose besides annoying non-english speakers  i am not exactly sure as to * what * purpose but they do have one ...

  and for some poles i noticed that they have an issue with placement of articles such as `` the '' or `` a '' in some sentences . 
  even the younger generation has issues with this but considering our language does n't use any sort of `` the '' articles , it 's not surprising ... case in point : `` is pain in the ass '' is written `` is * a * pain in the ass '' ,

  that sounds like confirmation bias to me but what do i know ? 
  besides , what did you expect them to do , stay in a country where they would get paid less but pay the same or more as a western european especially since the eu allows free movement ... 
  what is `` horeca '' and where do you go in the uk that you meet so many of them ? 
  you might be going into concentrated areas where a lot of poles live but i doubt they are all over the uk in massive numbers ... 
  comment below ours says approximately 870k ... 
  so 14 million poles in the uk ? 
  ( our current population within polish borders is 38 million ... ), 
  `` may you live in interesting times '' - supposedly a chinese saying ... could be just fortune cookie bs though ... 
   manage to have months/a year without terrorists attacks kinda doubt that will ever happen ... 
  i see your point but why set up the infrastructure to house people who will run westwards at the first opportunity ? 
  facilities and the people to run them are n't free . 
   who take on jobs much below market value the employers who offer such jobs are also part of the problem . 
  ca n't take what is n't being offered . 
  fine , but you 'll have to take all the german banks and corporations that send money to germany from poland as well . 
  we might not pay directly like germany does but various western european corporations have branches here that make good money for them and their home countries . 
  fairness from china . 
   when these refugees would mostly escape to somewhere else so why the need for a middleman ? 
  we ca n't force them to stay so why even send them here or to other countries where they obviously do not want to be ? 
  lol no . 
  a slim majority though ... 52 % vs 48 % ... 
  we have the same kind of grandmas in poland . 
  `` no '' means `` yes '' to them , apparently . 
  so like `` yeahhhhhno '' ?
