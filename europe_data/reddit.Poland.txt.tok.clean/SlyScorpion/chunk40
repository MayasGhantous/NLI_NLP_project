  has she actually committed arson on a refugee camp , though ? 
  russians hacking your stomach , eh ? 
  weird , i am getting a 404 when i attempt to go to r/uk . 
  has that subreddit been taken down recently ? 
  [ updated with more stats and from the official nato website ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf ), 
  you mean besides the banana thing ? 
  [ they complain about czechs getting lost & dying in their mountains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aumaitjyeaa ), 
   why do you have to be so difficult ? 
   uk flag hmmmmmmmm ... 
  not many people can even afford a tesla in poland either ... 
  is it something to do with [ usta\u0161e ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta%c5%a1e ) ? 
  the soviet government was more than happy to starve people via badly implemented collective farming and sending people off to gulags for dissent . 
  [ he 's busy over at fox news now . 
  ] ( http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2017/01/nigel-farage-joins-fox-news-233903 ), 
  i watched the meetings he had with the top business leaders in the u.s. and he mentioned lowering taxes and removing a lot of regulations that , from what i understand , make it more expensive to operate a factory in the u.s. 
  i am looking forward to see if anything comes about out of this . 
   shutting down the nafta actually , i think they are going to be renegotiating nafta since he did meet with the pm of canada and the president of mexico . 
  oh my ... wow . 
  i have no words . 
  i am getting the impression , after reading the article , that as long as she stays out of the eu nothing will be done . 
  when did the war in syria start because i really want to know what this guy was doing there ... 
  [ for anyone who is still unsure about the tpp ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-fawxetxle ), 
  my sentiments exactly . 
  i think someone 's got their jimmies rustled because the u.s. does n't want to be part of tpp , which even the reddit favored bernie sanders opposes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-fawxetxle, 
  looks like all those ukrainian/russian cigarette smugglers will have a new market i think ... 
  ok , i see what you mean . 
  we do n't have flags outside our house either unless it 's a national holiday like our independence day or something like that . 
   and they really have no choice ... what do you mean by this ? 
   waving french flag makes you look like a member of vichy a little more info on this ? 
  you just ordered one tousand leeters of milk !, 
  we 've had several female prime ministers and we have one in charge now sooo i do n't get it ... 
  they 're dead now , by the way . 
  sounds like they took some inspiration of alec baldwin 's version of trump from saturday night live ... 
  you know , if there was n't rock solid evidence like the video on facebook , i would also advocate for a trial but this is evidence beyond the shadow of a doubt at this point . 
  personally speaking , i am just tired of all the mollycoddling with * obviously * guilty ( see video evidence ) criminals like this . 
  am i not allowed to express my frustration at this now ? 
  yes , i am ruining the system lol . 
  i hold no power at all but i am ruining the system . 
  hyperbole much ? 
  they have incontrovertible evidence , not like there 's anything more to prove at this point . 
  they have evidence already so why give these guys the benefit of a fair trial ? 
  they acted in an uncivilized matter , they should not get the right to partake in a civilized procedure . 
  will sweden just skip the trial and throw these guys under the jail ? 
  i mean they have incontrovertible proof already ... 
  well , one thing i hope for is that the laws against this kind of thing get ramped up . 
  these guys should never be allowed to leave prison again . 
  so ~ ~ v4 ~ ~ ~ ~ v6 ~ ~ v8 ? 
  well , all i know is that we , speaking about poland , have until the end of january of this year to register our cards and then bam !, 
  if they ai n't registered , they 're turned off . 
  in short , keep an eye out , 
  any proof on this besides anything involving john oliver ? 
  `` we 've got all the best words ! '', 
  you might want to check because it snuck up by surprise on me but i guess that 's my fault for not keeping up with everything the eu decides to put into law ... 
  who are the drumphs ? 
  i could be wrong but i thought this law was eu-wide so the only thing i can say is be prepared unless it 's different for individuals and businesses in the czech republic ... 
   german  it 's a fake language i died . 
  no , thank you . 
  we remember the last time you tried to do so :p, 
  i ate some vegetables today , does that make me hitler ? 
  oh and i turned oxygen into carbon dioxide too , ... just like hitler did ... 
  ok , i got ta ask after watching trump 's inaugural speech : where is the emphasis on brute force and aggression ? 
  speaking of surveillance , there 's an eu-wide law in force since last june that forces you to register any sim cards you have or the number gets simply turned off . 
  source : http://www.gsma.com/publicpolicy/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gsma2013_whitepaper_mandatoryregistrationofprepaidsim-users.pdf, 
  is this the time to post the `` everyone i do n't like is literally hitler '' image ? 
  it already is . 
  just look at immigration as an example . 
  walking through a \u0141\u00f3d\u017a train station ages you 20 years confirmed !, 
  well , in my defense , i should have followed up with `` but not to the previous levels '' ... 
  expats can and do vote . 
  please define what is an `` evil element '' of society . 
  yeah , i should 've clarified with `` reported racist attacks '' but once i started constructing the sentence i could n't seem to fit that in properly :p, 
   there is a lot of rather strict control during the construction of a road . 
  in normal countries , yes . 
  i highly doubt that happened here with all the other shit that was going on around the whole road building fiasco . 
  and just how many of those roads needed to repaired after a year or so ? 
  what about the allegations that high quality materials were being stolen and being replaced with low quality stuff ? 
  you 'll get him one day !, 
  kinda odd for an american politician to say that during an official proceeding ... 
  i was referring to everything surrounding brexit . 
  you know , the pound falling drastically ( it got back up , of course ) and the sudden outburst of racist attacks that were supposedly brought to light by brexit , and things like that . 
  not sure if i am making any sense ... 
  do n't thank me  someone else posted the link  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5mq9iu/levels_of_air_quality_in_warsaw_today_are_8x/dc5q278/, 
  and we also have a tendency to substitute high quality building material with lower quality stuff too ... 
  / pol / was right again / s, 
  ah yes , in the second sentence it would n't make any sense but it could be used like a full stop the same way the word `` fuck '' tends to be used . 
  so make the same sentence and then just bolt on a `` kurwa '' at the end :d, 
  imagine our government trying to build one ... * shudder *, 
  to be honest , with coal we do n't have to worry about our government bungling yet another project like they did with our roads . 
  can you imagine what would happen if we had a `` przetarg '' to build a nuclear reactor around here ? 
  we 'd be chernobylfied within a year ... 
  it looks like a tea bag . 
  is he joking or what ? 
  some more context is required . 
  can she lower the prices of whatever goods or services she is offering without racing to the bottom ? 
  if you were to ask them , they 'd probably say that the country abandoned them ... 
  oh yeah , i can definitely chalk it up to transport as we have a shitload of cars and trucks and the majority of them run on diesel . 
  as for legionowo and the like , i would n't be surprised as the outskirts of any city are almost always neglected by the city itself ... 
  look at the first sentence :  fuck i almost slipped poles would say it like it this :  kurwa , prawie pizdnalem na glebe yes , it means `` whore '' on its own but , depending on the context , it can be used the same way as the word `` fuck '' ... 
  i am rather anxious too due to how much shit happened before the actual process has actually begun ... 
  context-wise , it 's the same as fuck :p,
