  i am no economist so all i can say is good luck to those living in the uk as this whole thing progresses , one way or another . 
  status : not invaded, 
  it was more of a refugee center , no ? 
  also , props to that guy , he manages to pronounce our '' \u0119 '' almost like a native and that is hard for americans :d, 
  not a country but i do get your reference :p, 
  sounds like someone 's been taking their joy :p, 
  so does the supposedly neverending darkness that plagues finland :p, 
  change it to blue and you have the eu ... 
  i am curious as to how long the eu will last , will it outlast the roman empire ? 
  well , i was n't going to question you too much  just wanted to get a general location because where i live not a single apartment building has a chimney , we all use communal gas heating . 
  if you saw weird colored smoke coming from a tenement you must 've seen it from a really poor part of town ... 
  lol , i had a wendish empire in my ck2 game but i never let russia form . 
  my wendish empire spanned all of russia :d, 
   warsaw where in warsaw ? 
  on the very outskirts ? 
  reason i am asking is because most places have communal gas heating ... 
  `` sure ... '' and then they defected ... 
  or the uk ? 
  immigration does n't count . 
  minefields and bunkers everywhere ... 
  how do you raid , rape , and loot without actually being there ? 
  are we dealing with schr\u00f6dinger 's norwegian ? 
  i believe archive dot is works around paywalls . 
  ( seriously getting tired of just about every goddamn thing getting auto deleted around here ffs ), 
  we have remote control technology these days :p, 
   komuna triggered, 
  well , you do send hordes of tourists our way . 
  does that count ? 
  [ now that the uk 's got the recipe ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg-4atre8n0 ), 
  money makes people forget , i guess ... 
  those damned french , going ` round establishing duchies and shit , how dare they ?!? 
  a healthy dose of scepticism never hurt anyone . 
  i would agree with you if our current government started talking about a potential polish exit from the eu . 
  they bitch and moan about the eu , yes , but they are n't going full ukip on it either . 
  well ... we 're talking about tusk here , after all . 
  the epitome of the money-grubbing polish politician . 
  resources and we just happen to be in the damn way :p, 
  you 're giving away state secrets , man !, 
  we have vodka cheaper than eesti ... 
  * [ jan sobieski iii intensifies ] *, 
  well , napoleon did drive through , established the duchy of warsaw , but i am not sure we can count that as an `` invasion '' ... 
  the deluge does n't ring a bell ? 
  careful , there 's probably a boris johnson sex dwarf out there ... 
  overwatch is sort of blizzard 's take on team fortress 2 but it has lots of female characters and , thus , it falls prey to rule 34 ... 
  are those words , `` espagnol '' `` espagnola '' , legit or just people misspelling ? 
  mine ( just below this comment ) is harmless . 
  they googled it on porn hub ? 
   silicone sex doll sweden , you have no room to talk . 
  `` german dirty talk '' just might qualify :p, 
  you mean [ the bitcher ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7k67kov.jpg ) ? 
   all that commie red in the subreddit instead of the pleasing eu blue, 
   could credibly promise to block neo-stasi type stuff please , that shit will be infiltrated to hell and breakfast by every governmental agency in the eu and possibly the u.s. not trying to sound paranoid here but i ca n't trust any government that wants to collect that kind of data . 
  i have no idea as to whose or what thing it is ... just pointing out a relevant user name :p, 
  a job is a job . 
  ca n't be picky in today 's economic climate ... 
  sometimes the upper classes want to get dirty ... 
  there 's apparently lots of overwatch-related porn ... 
  is that true for just the in-country destinations , though ? 
  what if you wanted to travel by train from poland to , say , the czech republic ? 
  such as ladyboys for some ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  man , indians really like their women . 
  wow . 
   either most women in the west are secretly lesbians/bisexual or this statistic is lying or some men really like seeing two women getting it on ... 
   giantess for poland wat, 
  uh huh and there 's nothing at all wrong with this scenario ... 
  [ well , have a nap then fire ze missiles !,

  hon hon hon no baguette for you , marine ... 
  * there are allegations that funds , collected directly from the public in the form of donations , have been [ used to pay for it services that are provided by the leader of the kod group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mateusz_kijowski ) kod ( `` komitet obrony demokracji '' committee for the defense of democracy ) is the largest group protesting the ruling party , pis ( law and justice ) . 
  what this means , in short , is that the guy who is in charge of the committee ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mateusz_kijowski ) is allegedly also making money from it ... 
  it works now , cheers !, 
   wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name . 
  is what i get from your link , just so you know . 
  yeah , we tried that . 
  we had local churches do so and any refugees we had were gone the next day of their own accord . 
  still gets broadcasted here afaik , do n't watch tv anymore though ... 
  i heard he 's good with the cyber ... 
  what the fuck is the spanish navy smoking and where can i get some ? 
  ( missionary only and for the purpose of procreation ), 
  look up stepan bandera and the upa . 
  because dude wanted money for it ... 
  we got a long way to go before we complete the westernization process ... 
  you 're in the wrong linguistic neighbourhood , sir ... :p, 
  yes, 
  that 's the thing , i 'd love to have a party that is more or less a centrist one that takes the good parts from both sides but , well , we 're not so lucky . 
  we still have to wait a couple of generations to get some decent politicians in office . 
   even criminals never really use guns and even gangs never really use guns man , poland in the 90s was somewhat overrun , in some places , by gangs and they all used guns to `` great '' effect . 
  so yes , criminals will use guns . 
  [ sebixes spotted !, 
  ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_e28urcmge0opv2amldgk4qypaspnuahf.jpg ), 
  we still have some sebixes left over though ... 
  glad you called . 
  listen , we would have looooved to elect someone other than those guys but after 8 years of the other party 's scandals , we thought we 'd try a return to the classics with pis . 
  i know , i know , it 's a shitty cake we 're being offered here but , man , you should 've seen the other guys . 
  one thing 's for sure , at least pis is n't too skilled at hiding their scandals . 
  the article makes it sound like it 's still being deployed , though . 
  correct me if i am wrong . 
  reptilian shape-shifters are sooooo two years ago ... 
  * beep * we 're sorry but we 're out right now trying to get a handle on our own government . 
  please leave a message after the `` kurwa ! '',
