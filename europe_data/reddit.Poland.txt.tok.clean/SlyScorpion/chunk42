  and we will get back to you as soon as possible . 
  what ? 
  care to go into some detail about this , if you do n't mind ? 
  there once was a sarcmark ... 
  never expect anyone to fix a mistake on the internet :p, 
   german flag  that gif of course ... :p, 
  still not sure what we did for romania to be considered `` best friends '' but i ai n't complaining either :p, 
  but what if they 're already here ? 
  * puts on conspiracy-proof tinfoil *, 
  i was born here and it kills me too :p wait until you start delving into the grammar portion :p, 
  and then nuke them again for good measure ... 
  torrent some huge things ( there are legal torrents out there  ) stream movies in 4k :d, 
  nice to hear that  thank you for your reply and i shall refrain from prying into your life any further :p, 
  cool , how do you like it coming from norway ? 
  serious question , no trolling intended . 
  governments should be competent enough to protect their citizens but not too competent ... 
  criminals can already get guns , though , regardless of the law of the land . 
  i know this is probably sarcasm but drinking alcohol while in the cold is the last thing you want to do :p, 
  same here . 
  [ beat your damn kids ... ] ( https://youtu.be/uwbc_v1xbau ), 
  give them an ass whooping now or let life do it for you - that is the question . 
  nah , we have proper sized anchovies : small but tasty . 
  also , my previous post was me [ baneposting ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/baneposting ) . 
  because that might get taken away for any number of reasons , i think . 
  for you ... 
  how much monthly ticket for this track costs ? 
  it depends on whether the person using that route can get a single ticket that covers the intercity train and ztm : https://www.google.pl/maps/dir/nowy+dw%c3%b3r+mazowiecki/warszawa+gda%c5%84ska,+00-001+warszawa/@52.3479204,20.7387018,11z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x471ea55972f4787f:0x68a7f3854e32f4a9!2m2!1d20.6925219!2d52.4465078!1m5!1m1!1s0x471ecb8a36933d49:0x217f77d253bc2ffa!2m2!1d20.994701!2d52.2584727!3e3, 
  ooh nice , poland did n't get hit with `` european russians '' label ... whew .

  portuguese sleeper agents ... 
   60 $ with a price like that it 's probably easier to just torrent an english version without the notes lol . 
  holy shit and here i am thinking my 3-month public transport ticket that costs 290 pln ( approx . 
  66 eur ) was expensive ... 
  are there any factual sources behind the `` 3 million pounds '' line ? 
  ahh i see ... 
   asking for a friend ... :p, 
   we have top men working on this . 
  top men !, 
   not anymore ... 
  `` hey guys , i bought this book by a known megalomaniac . 
  ai n't it cool ? '', 
  they 're getting the heavily annotated version anyways so what 's the worry ? 
  besides , the english version managed to put me to sleep ( the writing style is rambling and overly verbose with more than a touch of the bombastic in the english version ) , i ca n't imagine what the german version might do ... 
  the men are in the cafes ... 
  no using a country as a unit of measurement/comparison . 
  bad map 3/10 . 
  man , i had the same story deleted because of how frequently it gets posted ... 
  they do now ... with tourists ... 
  map is slightly old so there 's that ...

  [ maybe sweden can help ?

  * triggered *, 
  you 're still not getting into nordic , eesti ... 
   what i like about multiculturalism is being able to meet all other european nationalities and learn about eachothers countries . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  and they call us backwards ... ha !, 
  nope , i do n't get it at all . 
  ned flanders is way too cheery in the simpsons to be polish .

  super mario is technically japanese :p checkmate atheists / s, 
  it 's a short question with a very long answer . 
  i would love to answer it but i really do n't feel like getting into it ... 
  ah right ... oops ...

  fix 'd . 
  too cold , too dark , strange language ... / s, 
  this . 
  which ones are missing ? 
  good to know , thanks !, 
  i think just about every civilized country has those ... 
  still valid , yes . 
  truth be told , i wanted to find a map that did not mention `` gypsies '' or `` vampires '' for romania and this is what i found ... 
  edited my previous comment . 
  is it better now ? 
  sorry for using the wrong word ... 
  nah , i actually like the comic and think it 's hilarious :d also , it does bring in other countries so it 's not just about the `` scandies '' :p, 
  whatever the case , you should not remain silent and encourage other catalan people ( i think that 's the proper word ? ), 
  to wear their flairs so your ( general `` your '' ) side can be seen as well , 
   the sad thing is that most europeans are only reading crazy spanish nationalist comments i would n't be so sure .
