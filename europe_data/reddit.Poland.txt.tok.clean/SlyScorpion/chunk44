  it 's the most efficient one . 
  i tried to come up for an answer to this question but in the end i will write it off as a rhetorical one :p, 
  yes , when you come here you must set your watch back 45 years ... 
  i do n't know why we have a `` main market square '' as an attraction when we have an old town ( in warsaw ) just like the baltics and the czech republic . 
  hell , we also have krak\u00f3w and wroc\u0142aw , those cities alone attract many tourists ...

  interesting , but what 's the use of these letters ? 
  do they somehow offer some behind-the-scenes glimpses ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  but can they match [ this ? 
  who is `` burce '' lee ?

  as you should . 
  pining for the fjords too ... 
  we 're up to playing immigrant ping pong , i guess . 
  ca n't deport them , ca n't keep them ... 
   what is it exactly that 's stopping us from just shipping them back to libya ? 
  no spine . 
  all they have to do is take back their migrants ... 
  increasingly_nervous_man . png, 
  yeah but i think the bullets are just there for show :d, 
  we 'll just continue to annoy and aggravate instead so business as usual for us ... 
  this shitflinging from either side almost makes one yearn for the days of the cold war .

   a weapon of detergence whites or colors ? 
  :p i think you may have meant `` deterrence '' :p, 
  yeah , i think they want people to be able to take on part-time work without worrying that their benefits might be reduced . 
  it 's definitely going to be an interesting experiment in the long run . 
  reading the article , it sounds more like a supplement to part-time income but it 's not taxed or reduced if people take on some work . 
  hydroponics ... 
  it 's text . 
  i ca n't read minds and there 's a severe lack of the usual tone and body language like you 'd have in face-to-face conversation . 
  if you do n't want people taking you seriously put an '' / s '' in there . 
  saves everyone time . 
  oh , those guys sound bad . 
  `` revolution or election '' indeed ... 
  ** intensifies **, 
  yeah , i can see it giving us a necessary boost to our r&d sector which we have been kind of slacking on ...

  right . 
  there were a myriad of factors that lead up to that particular conflict , ones which i will research as time allows , 
  if any do , it wo n't be that many . 
  i doubt that any will , though , unless the ministry offers the same salary and other benefits that they enjoy in western european countries . 
   traditional art is decadent and counter-revolutionary anyway .
