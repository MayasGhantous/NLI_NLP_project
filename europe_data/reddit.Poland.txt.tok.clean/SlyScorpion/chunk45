  and goes against the principles of dialectic materialism ( whatever the fuck that gobbledygook actually means ... ) :p, 
  hence the reason i said that i 'd need to actually dig into the history and not stop at wikipedia . 
  i also tried to clarify this with `` because a 5 minute internet search is not going to show everything '' . 
  i 'd have to dig into the history around the deluge , because a 5 minute internet search is not going to show everything , but based on a casual glance it would appear that the swedish empire , at the time , needed money for their army and the plc was around , looking kinda rich and the rest , as they say , is history ... 
  reparations for the three partitions and for the independence we lost in 1945 after getting it back in 1918 . 
  i see someone is making good use of their latin studies :d, 
  ehhh i am not sure . 
  i mean it may be adequate for polish living conditions but why settle for `` adequate '' ? 
   emigrated ftfy, 
  it 's a joke :p, 
  according to the article , the cost of the damages came to around 30.000 pln ( approx . 
  they ca n't read latin either meus frater . 
  http://www.tvn24.pl/pomorze,42/waskotorowka-latem-nie-pojezdzi-zlomiarze-rozebrali-torowisko,317399.html article about thieves who stole portions of the railroad track just so people know i am not pulling this out of my arse or anything :p as for the documentary ... damn , that 's harsh . 
  did the guy ever manage to get the $ 800 ? 
   let 's solve mass corruption first shall we ? 
  good luck with that windmill ... 
  books from copernicus library kept in library of uppsala . 
  books from copernicus library kept in riksarkivet stockholm . 
  swedes ca n't read polish . 
  gib back the books !, 
   people steal them and probably take it to a recycling center for cash oh you have scrap thieves too ? 
  hell we 've had cases in recent years where they were taking apart our railroad tracks ... 
  [ i think it 's too late for that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pc4fh8l.png ), 
  you 're welcome to visit our museums although considering our position in the eu , if we did have anything that was considered to be stolen we would 've already been forced to give it back since other eu countries would throw their weight around for it . 
  that might 've been the case in the first wave but now probably not so much ... 
  ok but how would this be enforced ? 
  would this be enforced by the government of the host country or the home country ? 
  how would they pay for the full course if they do n't have a job while they are in school ? 
  not sure how the employment situation looks like for full time college students but i doubt that they are working in a full time job while going to school ... 
   is there any more valuable painting on the polish soil ? 
  nope , that painting is probably the most valuable one we have . 
  i think i can say it 's worth more than all the paintings made by polish artists put together ... 
  would n't be surprised . 
  maybe i am an uneducated philistine but how is it a `` masterpiece '' exactly ? 
  asking merely out of curiosity as , on the surface , it seems like a painting of a woman who came to da vinci 's studio and he painted what he saw . 
  i am actually curious as to what makes it a masterpiece for some folks , 
  why would they ship it to warsaw ? 
  should 've anschlussed russia back when we actually made it to the kremlin several hundred years ago :p kidding , of course . 
   sick of the westerners thinking we ( as nations ) only take euromoney without contributing for the greater good of all of us . 
  oh yes , that burns my ass too . 
  ah ok  well , i eat at a very hidden eatery near my work and the food is good there and cheap :d, 
  do tell what is worse . 
  is it the meat that gets `` plumped up '' with water to make it heavier ? 
  ( not sure if that is still the case ... ), 
   free how is it free if it 's paid for with taxes taken from the population ? 
  [ oh boy , here we go again ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ks63n/brain_drain_from_bulgaria_and_romania_helps/ ), 
  yep , that 's the guy . 
  or geography :p, 
  we 're not the usa , though . 
  man , i had to read that article 3 times and yep , we definitely paid that much money . 
  not sure what to make of this , to be quite honest . 
  then why is it still around ? 
  seems odd ... 
  hence the reason i did n't declare it as sufficient , 
  say no to british street festivals !, 
  must be the food ... 
   in the weeks since marushevska stepped down on nov 14 , the odessa region had increased its customs revenues by 30 % , or 300 million hryvnia ( $ 11 million ) . 
  not sure if evidence but ... 
  did they find money in her flat like they did with the russian anti-corruption boss a few months ago ? 
  ca n't give link because it 's from rt but google `` russian anti-corruption boss '' and you should find it ... 
  so did they have them in a bunker somewhere , frozen until necessary ? 
   peameal bacon mmmmmm bacon with cornmeal . . i could go for that !, 
   click on link with iceland in the title  see ice i do n't know what i was expecting :p, 
  let 's hope this is n't another solar roads fiasco ... 
  i eat computers so keep yer grubby hands off mah pc !, 
  they live in countries that do not have bacon named after their country ( canadian bacon ) , what did you expect ? 
   trying to sell you non-meat products pretending to be meat is n't that already happening or am i missing something ? 
  buy the western portion at least . 
  sell the east to the chinese ... 
  and whether they are actually made of vegetables or cardboard is another matter entirely ... 
   berlin should be sold to poland after that description ... no . 
  we have warsaw to make fun of :p, 
  show me on the doll where the bad sausage touched you ... 
  i 'd ban them just on the taste alone :p, 
  your link http://imgur.com/5cf20740-274e-4395-9253-9b4d1cd08a1e is broken :( i get the imgur giraffe instead ... edit : now that the link is fixed , yeah , i can agree with you : everything appears to be in order when it comes to labelling the boxes for the meat and vegan versions . 
  yeah , it 's flowery language for `` here 's how many people are outside of poland and they will never return '' . 
  of course , our census bureau wo n't say that . 
  `` the number of people staying abroad the end of the year '' = how many people are no longer in this country when we last counted . 
  [ see this screenshot . 
  look at the year 2004-2013 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yfgtw1e.png ) . 
  the top number is the overall total number of poles outside poland 's borders . 
  the bottom number is the amount of poles living outside of poland 's borders but still within europe . 
  also , please note that these numbers are measured in the thousands so 2196 = 2.196 million or 1891 = 1.891 million ( sorry for belabouring the obvious ... ), 
  hipokryzja , this is the same thing that happened in our country ( if i am correct in assuming you 're from poland based on your user name ) . 
  our governments sold off everything they could because `` our industries were n't profitable '' and `` we have to pay debt incurred by the communist regime '' . 
  now , we barely have any companies that are truly our own . 
  hell , even our largest breweries are foreign-owned . 
  that 's still too commie for me . 
  how long was it before they started fucking everything up ? 
  2 minutes ? 
  an hour ? 
  are these actual commies or just people with commie tendencies ? 
   green rather than red . 
  not for colorblind folks :p, 
  for 2.3569 seconds and no longer . 
  that 's a rather big `` if '' , though . 
  the longer they stay , the lower the chances of them returning home while they are still working ... 
   transnistria and who are they going to get doctors from ? 
  this is from our census bureau : http://stat.gov.pl/files/gfx/portalinformacyjny/pl/defaultaktualnosci/5471/2/7/1/informacja_o_rozmiarach_i_kierunkach_emigracji_z_polski_w_latach_2004-2013.pdf unfortunately it 's in polish but in 2013 there were almost 2.2 million poles outside of poland ... 
  on mobile atm but yeah i will try to get you a good source for this ,
