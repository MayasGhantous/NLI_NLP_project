  put a bag of money in the same room with a sick person who is in dire need of a specialist and see if they manage to get cured of their affliction . 
  also , the know-how tends to stay in the country the people with the know-how are living in . 
  same goes for those nutters who claim finland exists ... 
  well ... the op 's username does check out :d `` repostuje '' means `` i repost '' in polish :d, 
   `` this emigration has had a very negative effect on the bulgarian economy , for most of those \u00e9migr\u00e9s were highly qualified specialists , '' says mitko vassilev , chairman of the german-bulgarian chamber of industry and commerce , before pointing out that german investors often complain about the lack of well-trained skilled laborers in bulgaria . 
  i am merely commenting on the situation so no , i do n't have a solution . 
  i really wish i did but alas ... 
  in theory , yes . 
  in practice , most people who emigrate from a poorer country to a richer one will not come back unless it 's to retire , if at all . 
  profits to the corporations that open branches there . 
  no , of course it wo n't stop . 
  as for brain drain within countries , that 's still not as bad as having your doctors 2-3 countries away . 
  at least if a given doctor is within the country , people will be able to travel affordably and get their required care . 
  edit : added `` affordably '' to my second sentence to hopefully better clarify my statement . 
  this will be somewhat oversimplified but all the trade in the world wo n't help someone who needs a specialist and all of a country 's specialists are sitting in germany or wherever . 
  again , money on its own wo n't solve all the problems . 
  yes , they 'll have money from the eu and trade but what if people need doctors who specialize in a given field ( neurosurgeons , cardiologists , etc. ), 
  and the nearest specialists are 2-3 countries away ? 
  well , after the fiasco with our roads , i would n't trust our government to build a wood burning stove much less a nuclear reactor ... 
   `` this emigration has had a very negative effect on the bulgarian economy , for most of those \u00e9migr\u00e9s were highly qualified specialists , '' says mitko vassilev , chairman of the german-bulgarian chamber of industry and commerce , before pointing out that german investors often complain about the lack of well-trained skilled laborers in bulgaria . 
   today , the country , which has roughly seven million inhabitants , has only 28,000 doctors . 
  seven years ago there were 35,000 . 
  though this has led bulgaria and romania to look to the future with trepidation maybe i am making a mountain out of a molehill but those quotes do n't sound all too optimistic . 
  never said they had one , though . 
  and yes , i know both countries are very pro-eu but i am not sure what their stance towards the eu has to do with the conversation only because i never mentioned either country 's eu stance , 
   `` i earn about ten times as much here as i would in a romanian practice . '', 
  can either state invest enough money to counter what i just quoted from the article ? 
  money on its own ca n't heal a patient . 
  sure , they get millions from the eu but if qualified people are emigrating regardless how does that help ? 
  does n't help either of those countries ( romania and bulgaria ) . 
  if you look for racism in anything you will find it ... 
  actually , kaczy\u0144ski was part of the solidarity movement and was not a member of the polish communist party . 
  not defending the guy but he did not have a communist past in poland . 
  what if they are rogue archaeologists , eh ? 
  [ i suspect icelanders are the true elves around here ] ( http://6336-presscdn-26-82.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/icelandic_elves.jpg ), 
  can still report them :p, 
  we were a very unwilling member of the eastern bloc :p, 
  at first glance , i thought the word `` finlandization '' meant `` make ~ ~ the eu ~ ~ europe like finland '' . 
  how naive of me ... 
  even shitposts should be encrypted :p, 
  should be 10/10 tbh . 
  someone needs to add erdogan to oh ... sir !!!, 
  the insult simulator ... 
  as long as they keep the potatoes away from latvia ... 
  hopefully , they 'll get rid of lukaszenko soon ... 
  what about the orange revolution in ukraine ? 
  we have all that and the drunken tourists . 
  no herbs in russia ? 
  simply asking a question . 
  so what 's a non-touristy yet safe place to visit in portugal ? 
  `` what are you , a bigot ? '', 
  is what you 'll hear if you want to control immigration . 
  been down that road too many times around here ... 
  are there that many transexual students that this is an issue ? 
  correct . 
  even in the 80s the commies were killing people that were against communist rule . 
  one of the more famous victims of the communist regime in poland : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerzy_popie\u0142uszko, 
  i thought they only had * directions * ? 
  well , well ... look at this posh guy !, 
  we had fiat 126ps and polonezs that we were lucky to get after 10-12 years !, 
  what about the sea ? 
   third generation immigrants  risked their lives travelling they were born on european soil , where were they travelling from ? 
   they are n't becoming terrorists because they 're fleeing war . 
  they 're becoming terrorists because non muslims are attacking them and blaming them for everything so how come other immigrants who get attacked in their host countries do n't start driving trucks into crowds or bombing theaters ? 
  poles get their fair share of abuse in some places yet have you heard of a polish terrorist ? 
   if you want muslims to not be terrorists soooo why do n't they go to the many other islamic countries that are not at war ? 
  so what do you propose ? 
  sucking on the government teat ? 
  do note that i acknowledged in my comments that not everyone may be able to follow their ambitions for whatever reason and that we should definitely help those who can not in any way help themselves . 
  if you have your health and you have some modicum of skill or at the least some modicum of willingness to actually work , you should be able to find gainful employment and actually make something of yourself . 
  if your country does not offer any employment then move ( if you can ) . 
   workers rights what rights are workers still missing in the eu ? 
   ecological measures * what * ecological measures ? 
   public services who are managed to service the population so more civil servants that will cost money to maintain . 
  how would these services be managed and * what * services did you have in mind ? 
  also , how will you ensure that the service ( s ) run smoothly since `` public '' services usually tend to be horribly mismanaged and wasteful . 
  that could describe just about any country in the world , though ... 
  i sure as hell look nothing like the polish guy ... 
  [ i was born in it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpmngpzklmq ) ? 
  ahh do they make the [ `` is pop out of ground '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bmk3bi2.png ) noise too ? 
  do you sometimes feel the need to squat ?

   magically appeared as soon as the communists took over yeah , it did n't take long after the communist take over for poverty , widespread corruption , lack of trust in the state and authoritarian nature to appear . 
  what can i say ? 
  they were efficient at fucking everything up as soon as they took over . 
  sorry to burst your bubble . 
  lamer architecture and shittier weather ... 
  i did n't insinuate such , someone else did ... 
   `` nu zaiec nu pagadi '' i 've always known it as `` wolf & rabbit '' :d, 
  the irish one 's got a look that says `` i have seen some shit and some shit accessories '' to me ... 
  too bad because then they wo n't remember anything , 
  i was in the us and you basically said exactly what i was going to say on the matter , 
  ask the nordics for snow . 
  surely sweden has some ... 
  if by `` rowdy '' you mean they ask us to pronounce [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqkvqjjvr9u ) ... then yes :p, 
  so did the article , though . 
   at least until the next election , poland -- one of the brightest stars of post-communist europe -- will be governed like a banana republic . 
  last sentence of the article ...
