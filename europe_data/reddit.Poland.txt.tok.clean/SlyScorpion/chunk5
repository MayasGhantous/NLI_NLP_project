  i like this proposal as this will ( hopefully ) stymie the siphoning of profits by the various german and french companies we have here . 
  this : * apple france makes 1 billion euro profit * apple germany makes 1.5 billion euro profit * apple ireland makes 0.5 billion euro profit  today ( oversimplified ) : * apple transfers these 2.5 not-irish billions to ireland , and they pay the irish corporate tax on 3 billion euro profit . 
  is exactly what 's happening now in poland ... 
  except the mountains . 
  always keep an eye on the mountains  . , 
  so do we . 
  ahhh so they are like neets ?

  it would cause an increase in prices because our merchants and such would use that occasion to do so . 
  about what ? 
  you 're thinking of hemp , no ? 
  because hemp is closely related to cannabis and can be used to make textiles , paper , and more but it does n't have the thc like cannabis does ...

  are n't we not in the euro because a ) we keep delaying doing so and b ) we do n't yet meet the criteria for having the euro ? 
  also , the euro would jack up prices here so bad that i am glad to not have it , to be honest . 
   why is poland so poor ? 
  because we have to live between germany and russia .

  we have bicycle lanes on the sidewalk ( wherever possible ) so cyclists do n't need to get on the road . 
  thanks best silesia , you get me ... 
  oh this is top hue material right here !, 
  also , there are ways to manipulate elective monarchy results . 
  i do n't remember what they are atm but i know it can be done as i 've managed to become the reformed pagan wendish empire because of elective monarchy . 
  yeah , i was reading something about turkey and poland 's relations a while back and noticed `` lehistan '' come up ,

  that 's a picture from the late 80s/early 90s if i ever saw one . 
  how does she look now ? 
  you can get both your possessions and liberty back and you can appeal to work out paying back the tax . 
  ca n't exactly do that if you 're dead from not paying some sort of religion-based `` tax '' . 
  also , having to pay a tax simply because you do n't follow some religion is just ludicrous and , quite frankly , backwards . 
  not paying taxes does n't bring you a death penalty in most countries or actual bodily harm . 
  sounds more like mafia-style protection money . 
  a lot of poles have lived , or continue to live in , various countries , including yours , long enough to know how things work in a given country . 
  ca n't say the same happens in reverse .
