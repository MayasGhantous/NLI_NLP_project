  what then ? 
  just leave the area as-is ? 
  are there versions of these videos with subtitles ? 
  the broken , stilted english of the translators gets a bit grating ... 
  i got ta ask : what does `` sensible urban zones '' even mean in the context of the topic at hand ( the existence , whether real or imaginary , of so-called `` no go zones '' ) ? 
  man , and i thought the occasional drunken signing after a football match was bad ... sheesh . 
  erm , it 's the title of the article ... 
  will anything be done about this guy or what ? 
  just finished reading the article and there was no mention of expelling him anywhere out of the uk ... 
  which is kind of odd since poland fought against ottoman expansion in vienna ... 
  the same settlers [ who settled in the 1890s ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/company_rule_in_rhodesia ) or what ? 
  i am sorry you never lived under communism . 
  maybe then you would not be so quick to defend a communist . 
  and ? 
  my parents were born in poland as was i. . . 
  it 's not . 
  communists deserve every bit of scorn . 
  if you 're born within the borders of poland then you are a polish citizen . 
  not sure what you are aiming for ... 
  if they were born there then it 's very much their country and land . 
  * laughs in russian *, 
  tak ... oregano xd, 
  ah right i forgot that part where there were private businesses in nazi germany . 
  well then , let 's see whether fascism actually rises again . 
  i kinda doubt it will , though , since the majority of european countries have experienced it in one fashion or another ... 
  or mucha 's hair dresser getting a government appointment ... 
  i think it might lead to corporations being more in control since they hold a lot of actual capital , if you think about it . 
  i am not sure , not an expert or anything , that fascism is all that conducive to capitalism since the state , supposedly , owns everything . 
  correct me if i am wrong ... 
  of course we do n't eat anything else , why would you think that ? 
  we have a nice meat sauce in the morning with a meat-on-meat sandwich with meat in it . 
  dinner consists of meat with a side of meat with some meat sauce to top it all off ... / s, 
  if communism ever decides to rear its ugly head again , i will die fighting it . 
  communism has no place in the world . 
  yes , capitalism has lots of problems but at least it can be reformed peacefully ( or so i hope ) whereas communism had to be literally starved to get it to reform somewhat before it fell . 
   tractor with farmers in the background was that commie vietnam money or something ? 
  polish money or vietnamese money ? 
  :p you know are first world when you can say `` i spent too much money on money ! '', 
  you are of many rich woooow, 
  fine , go with castro 's cuba , that is a communist country as well . 
  not doing so well , is it ? 
  why would anyone be a communist after the fall of the ussr ? 
  is it the `` but true communism has never been tried ! '', 
  line of reasoning ? 
  as for what you deserve ? 
  ridicule and scorn , you filthy little communist . 
   of course , you might not know what a `` commie block '' really looks like ... lol , i lived in one during the 80s so i think i know what one looks like :p, 
  that guy should go to haiti , i heard there are some villages where you can still see lots polish street names from the time poles settled there ... 
  because anyone who follows an ideology/political system proven by history to absolutely horrible deserves it . 
  communists belong in a museum and nowhere else . 
  but is it good , though ? 
  if only mccarthyism would serve to keep any actual commies out of power it would be great . 
  unfortunately , knowing humanity , it would be used against others in a very negative way i.e. 
  accuse someone of being a communist in order to mess up their life even though the accused never had anything to do with communism . 
  lol do explain please . 
  maybe socially democratic but not wholly socialist ... 
  not working for me either in chrome or firefox on antergos linux ... 
  goddamnit eu please stop making us use plug-ins ... 
  put this on youtube or something : /, 
  honestly speaking , i would totally play a proper ussr simulator  . , 
  russia simulator : belarus edition ? 
  does it have a linux version , though ? 
  errrr downloadable content then ? 
  or an expansion pack  . , 
   russia lite that 's belarus :p we 're proper euros now ...

  in the bigger cities ? 
  yes . 
  cool song about the martial law riots ... [ kazik - mars napada ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ggfl0vb8cg ), 
  so are [ member berries ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhjhu15f-hg ), 
  any government we get will be shitty , what matters is how shitty it will be . 
  i am a pole and i just bought a 2000 pln tablet for laziness reasons and i did not have to take out a loan to do so . 
  while we 're not rolling in money , i say being able to buy something for 2000 pln without starving is doing pretty good .

  the u.s. also has a much larger population than venzuela . 
  you should calculate per capita . 
  i know right ? 
  all it needs is an `` r '' in the right place ... 
  `` stop liking what i do n't like ! '', 
  `` countryballs are bad and you should feel bad about liking them '' i think ? 
  [ zimbabwe 's white farmers had their land seized ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-seized-white-farmers-land-now-some-are-being-invited-back/2015/09/14/456f66d6-45d2-11e5-9f53-d1e3ddfd0cda_story.html ), 
  too late for that since `` polish death camps '' is already a thing ... 
  are you talking immediately after the fall of communism or a while after ? 
  i heard the 90s were a weird time as i was n't here during the 90s ... 
  we 'll just let them go to germany , it 's a much richer country . 
  we 're certainly not going to build calais-style camps on our soil ... 
  maybe if gypsies actually tried acting human for once ... you know , working on that rampant stealing and begging that they do in groups ... 
  the guy going to the pizza parlor with a gun is not trump 's fault though ... 
  the [ racist attacks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djx3t9iec1a ) tend to happen against trump supporters rather than by them ... 
  waffling is what i would call it . 
  you throw money at the poor to garner votes while kissing big business ' ass to get the financial support . 
  warzone or that she felt safe ? 
  since child rapists are pedophiles ( that is their orientation after all ) , you ca n't reform them . 
  unless you think that they will somehow magically stop raping children because they wo n't . 
  it 's useless when the only thing that does work is limiting access to children . 
  one should not accept such half-assery as `` not as effective as '' when it comes to the safety of children . 
  also , this bullet point trumps your assertion :  pedophilia is a sexual orientation and unlikely to change .
