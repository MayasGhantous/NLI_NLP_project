  i get the feeling that sarkozy may be just the tip of the iceberg ... 
  ok , a question then : can you go to jail in today 's germany if you express a dissenting opinion that is not `` kill all the _______ '' ( fill in the blank ) ? 
  just trying to gauge your previous comment , if you do n't mind . 
  no , it 's not true . 
  also , here 's a link from harvard about pedophilia and rehabilitation : http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia i trust you consider the source a trustworthy one . 
  no , you can not . 
  it 's what drives them . 
  can you rehabilitate someone who prefers men so that they no longer prefer men ? 
  can you rehabilitate someone who has a masochism fetish ? 
  also , harvard studied this already : http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia, 
   you would go to jail for saying this on the streets you know , i am waiting until the german government starts `` disappearing '' people who dare to speak their mind about a touchy subject on the streets . 
  lol yeah right , they said the same damn thing about homosexuality . 
  can you rehabilitate a man who prefers blonde women ? 
  can you rehabilitate homosexuality ? 
  can you rehabilitate any sexual preference ? 
  better than having someone else who is not trump tell you what he 'll do ... 
  they look too new to be commie blocks ... 
   do any of the refugees/immigrants who are undocumented receive a crash course in western standards when they arrive here ? 
  does this count ? 
  seen plenty of people i liked do something horrible . 
  i no longer like them so there you go . 
  normal humans do n't go around raping kids . 
  pedos will never be human to me and that 's final . 
  i am not going to ever consider pedophiles as humans since they act like the animals that they are . 
  keep defending the pedos , i guess . 
  sooo why not cut off that arm , then ? 
  ca n't rehabilitate pedos though . 
  literally virtue signalling ... 
  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure ... 
   we 're talking about people . 
  once someone rapes a child they 're no longer human to me , sorry . 
  pedos ! = people and that 's all there 's to it . 
  once they rape someone , they already are psychos . 
   might as well try to reabilitate them rehab on pedos does n't work , it has never worked , and it never ever will work . 
  also , they 're already child rapists so i do n't think they can get anymore psychotic ... 
  nice , thanks for the link !, 
  as an apache attack helicopter ( still waiting for my missile implants ) , i feel rather excluded by `` ladies and gentlemen '' . 
  free gibs , man ... 
  it never is once a socialist state crashes and burns . 
  i had no idea an italian ( see op 's flair ) could go rogue ... 
  the country 's only a model ... 
  it 's so german it went through belgium first  . , 
  pffft , that 's nothing . 
  women can retire at 60 whereas men can retire at 65 in poland . 
  * invents , patents , and sells the porkini *, 
  * offers the german officials nice positions on russian gas boards of directors * you were saying ? 
   implying italians can swim :p, 
  you make me laugh , you go to gulag last !, 
  has n't schulz 's reputation been tarnished by the eurobonds idea as well ? 
  * bribes state officials * now with cronyism !, 
  * buys pool and throws out the socialists *, 
  thank you !, 
  but what if i am a capitalist ? 
  can i buy better indications ? 
  prosecute . 
  persecution is something else entirely , 
  paywall ... 
   full integration of eurozone area i am interested to see how that would work when you have countries like greece whose economic situation has been a so-called spectre haunting the eurozone for some time now ... 
  new balance are a brand or model of shoes . 
  it does n't matter to me but people will be all like `` poland 's government has taken over all press !!! '' . 
  i do not have a preference for either source , i am neutral about them but i just wanted to avoid outright dismissal due to our current political situation . 
  i hope i made my point clear , 
  u/istilllikechieftain posted this in the comments below : https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/merkel-welcomed-hundreds-of-thousands-of-refugees-now-some-are-suing-her-government/2017/07/20/2d9e13aa-68a7-11e7-94ab-5b1f0ff459df_story.html, 
  i am not sure but ca n't some polish eu reps request documents in polish ? 
  as for `` importance '' , i really do n't know but i 'd prefer if all of the official communication from the eu and its institutions was in english only since that is the default language of trade around the world anyways ... 
  not disbelieving the source but considering people think we are experiencing a lack of freedom of the press , can you tell me who ultimately owns wprost ? 
  but those are already used in , say , the eu parliament , though . 
  ever watched one of those eu-parl meetings where some our pl reps were speaking in polish to the group ? 
  i would like to see them try and use [ interslavic ] ( http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/ ) with the cyrillic alphabet ... 
  to filter out the linguistic casuals ? 
  it 's called the long game ... 
  we do n't trust anyone especially the pernicious czechs / s, 
  could i ask for a source on that , please ? 
  you will need 4 more of those in order to summon captain europe , though . 
  mass unchecked immigration ? 
  very undesirable , yes . 
  controlled immigration where the new arrivals and natives get used to each other instead of both groups forming enclaves ? 
  perfectly fine . 
  [ the tide is turning ] ( http://i.imgur.com/henoqi9.gif ), 
  i am surprised i did not see `` mordor '' written on the russian part :p, 
  so can we add a new term : `` dutch egg '' to the dictionary of all things dutch ? 
  with the internet being so prevalent these days is there any measurable difference if they are in the country or outside of it ? 
  ayyyyyyy, 
  [ what you did there ... ] ( http://imgur.com/a/j9wlu ), 
  i ca n't find a source right now but i 've heard that for every euro paid into poland , germany gets 83 eurocents back . 
  i am not sure how that works and i am currently looking for a reputable source ... 
  i personally expect a `` wag the dog '' situation one way or another . 
  by `` wag the dog '' i mean that the bill gets passed in another way entirely or while we are distracted with a different more controversial bill . 
  to give some context to this , while people were protesting the judicial reforms the ruling party passed a couple of other bills that were n't as controversial but will make life a bit more annoying in poland . 
  one of those bills will probably raise the price on water provided to the home and things like that . 
  but what if the `` jihadi '' has a bomb jacket strapped to their body ? 
  we have a small ( approx . 
  50,000 or so ) contingent of vietnamese people living in poland and they integrate rather well from what i 've heard ... 
  they 're yuuuge , believe me folks !, 
  well , if you are n't completely burned on poland , i highly recommend visiting warsaw as it 's much safer ( just do n't come on november 11th for your own safety , even most of the natives stay inside during that day . ), 
  it 's just tourists on vacation , duh !, 
  the soviet union was a genocidal regime , it just killed indiscriminately . 
  might be posting from a phone . 
  happened to me a couple of times when i phoneposted on reddit . 
  can we just get a megathread for this meme like all the others before it ?
