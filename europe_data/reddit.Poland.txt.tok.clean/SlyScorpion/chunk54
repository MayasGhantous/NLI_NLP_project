  poland has proper eggs . 
  no chemicals , swear on me mum . 
  i somewhat understood this reference . 
  not an authority on that city but i heard things about it so yeah ... sorry about that !, 
  yes and we consider 1 km between two people to be too close for comfort :p, 
  yeah that sounds like a skinhead or a football hooligan with regards to the baldness . 
  did this happen in warsaw or elsewhere ? 
  we had priests getting assassinated by the former regime and a polish pope who , according to the history books , did a lot to resist the commie regime . 
  news so fake god had to strike it down himself / s, 
  i watched this video a few days ago and i really like how the guy lists facts ( or what appears to be facts ) without all the `` based poland savior of the west ! '', 
  shit one would hear whenever watching any other video about the v4 or poland . 
  how much humidity was there ? 
  i noticed i can handle high heat but the humidity just outright saps all motivation from me ... 
  this damn headline is annoying for two reasons ( yes , i read the article hence my annoyance ... ) 1 . 
  the article refers to schr\u00f6der who already had a high position within nord stream ag 2 . 
  for those who do n't know who the guy in the thumbnail might be it looks like another for german leader is getting a cushy position in a russian gas company board . 
  will we hear about it ? 
  not refuting your statement but in all this noise going on lately it 's hard to find the relevant info ... 
  good thing they do n't have that eu army to whip those dissenting countries ... 
  i shudder to think of what will happen when an actual eu army is formed . 
  a `` state of emergency '' is a european value . 
  til . 
  great , we 'll lose this one but let 's see what happens i guess . 
  wew ... those toilet cleaning jobs . 
  they can have them for all i care . 
  you got a link to the page where you can pay 45 zloty for unlimited lte internet ? 
  i currently use orange but they have data limits and i 'd like to have unlimited internet without a contract ... 
  good , that way people will stop complaining that `` poles took muh jerbs !, 
  but if you replace the word `` poland '' with just about any other country , it almost fits . 
  just my two eurocents . 
  `` 27 prime ministers ! '', 
  how fast was that unlimited lte and was it unlimited or `` unlimited until you used x amount of data '' ? 
  some countries place additional penalties upon either the assault or attempted murder of a police officer and i was wondering if that 's the case in germany , that 's all . 
  so instead of the usual `` bong ! '', 
  it rings `` sieg bell ! '', 
   other guy well , if she * identifies * as such  . , 
  which provider ? 
  contract or pay-as-you-go ? 
  janusz korwin-mikke is that you ? 
  this is how the government sneaks up on unsuspecting brits watching forbidden porn on their pcs ... 
  what does `` sicherungsverwahrung '' translate to ? 
  according to the article , the criminal managed to get a hold of the police officer 's gun ... 
  hmmm , so there 's no additional charges for attempting to murder an officer of the law ? 
  wow ... that is some serious finnposting . 
  almost beats spurdo for me ... 
  love the [ jeb !, 
  posting ] ( https://i.redd.it/i1oln9qy8f3z.jpg ), 
   hans shot first ftfy :p, 
  just send lord buckethead . 
  he seems like a reasonable enough chap . 
   i have a lot of experience . 
  in the same sentence as `` pedophile '' ... not calling you one , of course , just commenting on the slightly awkward placement :p, 
  i hope they put the guy who did this away for life . 
  i mean he attempted to kill a police officer . 
  here 's hoping the wounded police officer recovers and returns to her job . 
  i dunno ... i 'd rather have unlimited ~ ~ power ~ ~ gigabytes :p, 
  was the finger attached to the [ hand of doom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1y9oousoqs ) ? 
  [ mfw this whole brexit thing just gets more and more `` interesting '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/15wxjoz.gif ), 
  hmmm i wonder if the funds in your country were used to improve the infrastructure of your country for all of those french & german corporations to move in and operate within your country ... 
  fake ~ ~ plate tectonics ~ ~ news ~, 
  ca n't say i blame you for your apprehension . 
   can anyone explain why there has been such a big decrease ? 
  perhaps people do n't know if they wo n't have problems in the future once brexit is complete . 
  just a guess ... 
  there 's always patreon ... 
  get out you foreigner out of this place we are both foreign to !, 
  reeeeeeeeee !!!, 
   anyway , i did n't say that we are racist free in portugal never said you did nor was i trying to imply anything of the sort . 
  i just posted that comment as a contrast of sorts but not as an end-all-be-all argument . 
   students are advised to stay in their dorm rooms to avoid being assaulted by far-right poles not sure if it 's the fault of the translation but i think the article mentioned some manifestation ? 
  also , i do n't know much about bialystok and what the poles are like in that city . 
  i do know that in my city , warsaw , you have people from all over the place ( mostly students from the looks of them , i.e. 
  young ) going about their business and no one bothers or assaults them . 
  not saying that assaults do n't happen in warsaw , of course . 
  also , when it comes to the `` nationalist manifestations '' even the natives know to stay in their house during the november 11th independence day march as that is when onr is out and about . 
  wat ... google translate told me the following :  many portuguese are racist to the blacks but when they go to blue-eyed blond countries they do not consider the portuguese as pure whites !, 
  what i think makes sense . 
  as for the racism of the poles we are in 2016 caramba racism is for ignorant retardants translating from portuguese to english ... 
  so no , i am not saying `` portuguese are not pure white '' you can see the comment for yourself in the article if you do n't believe me . 
  quanto ao racismo dos polacos estamos em 2016 caramba racismo \u00e9 para retardados ignorantes just something i saw in the comments section ... 
  they did n't have enough balls to do it in germany , i see . 
   native fucktards it is n't just the natives , though . 
  if their situation is anything like ours when we go `` west '' , they 're probably also getting exploited by their own in addition to getting exploited by our fuckheads ... 
  well , [ we 're working on the `` negative opinion '' ] ( http://www.paradarownosci.eu/en/home-page/ ), 
   what part of it ? 
  hmm let 's see :  you cant drink on the streets  cencorships by the church  arrests because you `` offended religious feelings '' the following criticisms were not in your original post from 4 days ago , by the way :  the fact that darker skinned erasmus stundents got beaten in the metro ? 
  old news and yeah , i do n't like it either but we , the poles who live in poland , do n't condone it either . 
  if we did then you 'd hear about it more often . 
  also , do you know the entire story beyond `` darker skinned students '' ? 
  serious question because neither you or i were there and we do n't know the extenuating circumstances . 
   the fact that polish representative in eu parliament openly said women are inferior to men ? 
  this is also new and we know about this quite well and we do n't like it either . 
  keep in mind we sure as hell did n't expect him to go full / pol / in the eu parliament with his `` ein reich , ein volk , ein ticket '' bullshit on top of the `` women should be paid less because they are smaller and weaker '' ( that was the more specific version , btw . ) . 
  also , not every pole voted for him . 
   the fact that poland held the biggest right-winger march in europe ? 
  you mean the one that 's held every november 11th ? 
  the one where the organizers have to ask for permission from the city every time ? 
  which `` right winger '' march are you exactly referring to ? 
   do not lie to yourself , you are becoming a hussar once poland is criticized . 
  no , it 's that i 've heard the same criticisms over and over and over and over again .
