   voter id laws [ do voter id laws really suppress the black vote ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrbxzgwcdgs ) yes i know the source lists fox news but look at the content ... 
  low energy !, 
   there were also other issues like voter suppression from republicans because they hate black people voting . 
  are you referring to gerrymandering or [ something like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=negbkhyguhu ), 
  afaik `` hombre '' in spanish means means `` man '' so in german it * should * be `` mann '' ( keep in mind that nouns get capitalized in german :p ), 
   low tax rates for corporations , exemptions and low wage workforce . 
   some kind of a perverse cheap sweatshop of the e.u. 
  does n't that make your country a `` cheap sweatshop '' already , though ? 
  only asking out of curiosity . 
   the court conditionally fined the man 4,000 swiss francs ( # 3,190 ) . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
   the communist is a literal dragonball z ripoff fucking lol . 
  to avoid splashing everything else ? 
  i have no idea ... 
  as always - no . 
  [ germany is on the visa waiver program , poland is not . 
  ] ( https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visa-waiver-program.html/ ), 
  do you have any salient counterpoint besides `` none of this is correct '' ? 
  afaik germans can easily move to the us because the us allows germans to move there more easily than people from former soviet bloc countries . 
  poland , for example , is subject to the `` visa lottery '' so it 's a lot harder for poles to move to the us . 
  how do i write that shrugging emoticon on here again ? 
  because that 's what my reply is to that question in a non-sarcastic way . 
  lol ok ... are these `` experts '' going to provide us with an all-new energy infrastructure , then ? 
  because poland , unfortunately , is still sucking down coal like nobody 's business ... 
  still a `` kid '' when compared to all the other politicians when it comes to age ... 
  nah , i think he 's moved on to character assassination for non-russian critics of his regime . 
  the polonium reserves are for russian critics ... 
  germany ? 
  nah , rumsfeld even called germany a part of `` old europe '' because of their unwillingness to go look for wmds .

  hey romania !, 
  do n't worry , you are not alone in the `` wtf are they doing !? '', 
  department when it comes to religion . 
  catholics get up to some crazy things here as well ... 
  well shit , warsaw is off the map entirely replaced with irkutsk , a city i know nothing about ... 
  russia big !, 
   they will stabilize economically how and with what ? 
  and not the banker 's . 
  not pictured :  lines of coke and half burnt 100 $ bills in the ash tray :p, 
  you mean the quill ? 
   introduce nationalisation they should let failing banks die so that people do n't have to pay for them . 
  it 's not the common man 's fault that a bank mismanaged the money entrusted to it . 
   specially german as if german industry needed any help to stay on top lol . 
  you should try a good blush ( pink wine ) . 
  did you drink some really dark red wine aka merlot ? 
  because if so then i agree with you . 
   police had known about his drug trafficking past and after the attack they tried to alter the wording in their files to avoid blame . 
  absolutely disgusting on the part of the police officers involved . 
  oh you sweet summer child . 
  we 're `` poor '' and not germany , sweden , or france . 
   any other lithuanians lithuania is one person ... 
  the pm is in charge , though ... 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcpjgl2bals ), 
  thanks for this post . 
  i was going to ask about that bust because it looks similar to pilsudski from far away ( it 's the mustache ... ), 
  nice try , but we are n't russia :p, 
   the guy our current pm is female :p, 
   they always change sides i have an idea for renewable energy : give italy two options on something and generate electricity from the energy of their constant changing sides ... 
  maybe not freedom of movement but what about businesses moving to india as a result ? 
  not trying to fearmonger here , just wondering if this would be a consequence of an fta ... 
   resulting in lower wages and more unemployment for eu countries ... 
  most french people do n't seem to care , from what i 've read in this sub before and after the election . 
  ehh , are n't there more chinese speakers nowadays ? 
  you 're outside of the eu and have low gdp ? 
  i see . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  so not really french ? 
   he went in the pit to meet some blue collar workers on strike and told them he would n't save their jobs really ? 
  i could 've sworn that he said that their factory would not be leaving france . 
  is this when he visited the whirlpool factory or is this a different visit ? 
  trump does n't particularly care for cnn so trump would approve of macron calling cnn `` fake news '' or `` organ of influence and propaganda '' . 
  why not just have coinstar machines for euro currency so people can take their loose change and change it to bills or something ? 
   unsure of the us figure though . 
  are those ethnic poles or descendants ? 
  that would most likely be a mix of descendants as well as poles who were originally born in poland . 
  putin is a lot smarter than trump so good luck with that . 
  just go with `` czechy '' , czechs ... 
   would the polish be happy to take that risk ? 
  we 'd get thrown under the bus again . 
  we 're nothing more than a glorified buffer zone against russia . 
  they like compound words . 
  [ it 's not finnish without spurdo ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lvrxf ), 
  [ like the us ? 
  and rectangular not spherical ... 
  because it 's a sensitive point for trump from what i 've heard ... 
  poland is depicted as upside down . 
  so if you see monaco spouting a `` kurwa ! '', 
  then it 's actually poland . 
  depends on the country ... 
  it was but that apparently does n't matter because poland bad ... 
   wissam and ali lost heart when austria sent them back to croatia before i read the rest ... is this going to be like that `` when home is n't where the heart is '' article about estonia ? 
  edit : read the rest , seems more positive than the article i mentioned earlier . 
  haha nice , i could n't find that exact one !, 
  totally not compensating ... nope !, 
  [ so something like this ? 
  what they do n't tell is the amount of forms you have to fill out to get the enlargement ... 
  revenge , bitch !, 
   bit of a step up from wendy 's imo you shut your dirty mouth !,
