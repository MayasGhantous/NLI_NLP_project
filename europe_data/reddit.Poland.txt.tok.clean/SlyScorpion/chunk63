  i ca n't find the source now but during ww2 people were supposedly demanding that the only polish refugees that should be taken would be `` women , children , and the elderly '' . 
  i will not claim that we , poles , were saints during our time as refugees in ww2 but please note the following : 1 . 
  poles flew in the raf . 
  i highly doubt that the ww2 refugees were going around claiming that they wanted to be in a country where there were a lot of catholics . 
  i kind of doubt that the majority of them would 've fled in the middle of the night towards a country perceived as `` richer '' . 
  the refugees that did go to other countries did end up going back to poland . 
  not all of them , of course , but more than enough . 
  last but not least , i am certain that there were opportunists even during those trying times who decided to take advantage of the situation somehow ...

  ca n't believe people would still fall for that ... 
  it 's a combination of factors : 1 . 
  we do n't take any in because of obvious political reasons ( see pis and their catering to their electorate ) . 
  we had syrians sue to try and get their refugee status revoked if they were given it in poland . 
  any families that we have taken in ended up high tailing it towards germany or sweden ...

  because and i 'll quote the article again :  when the two families set out from turkey in a rubber raft on feb. 17 , 2016 , they thought they would be joining family in germany within a few days of landing in greece . 
  instead , they were trapped on the wrong side of europe 's closing borders .

  i understand it as a joke but i am not kidding when we had syrians attempt to get their refugee status revoked if it was confirmed in poland ... 
   most would have preferred germany , sweden or france , countries with flourishing immigrant populations so what 's this about not creating parallel societies despite the fact that people of foreign origin would like to live where other immigrants live ?
