  corruption happens because people want easy money . 
  are n't music concerts a cultural thing , though ? 
  but does he have electrolytes ? 
  yeah , instead they can get 600 euros in social benefits in germany . 
  win-win . 
  my bad then , 
   you should introduce czech car brand ( czech republic is the country where only white people are , just like you ! ), 
  called '' \u0160koda '' you mean volkswagen with a different name ? 
  or is \u0160koda fully czech again ? 
  last i recall they were either bought out by vw or vw owned the brand ... 
  tis true : /, 
  was n't it france under sarkozy that bumped gadafi off in the first place ? 
   is this what we 've come to ? 
  yes . 
  good luck !, 
  our crazy catholics are not blowing themselves up in the name of jesus , though . 
  at least our president has almost no power so he can be as goofy as he likes ... 
  you mean `` all over ** the ** cyber '' right ? 
  it 's not just cyber but the cyber ... 
  depends on the market but i would bet that most of them are manuals ... 
  oh yeah , i remember seeing the `` assembled in mexico '' tags on american cars during my time as a mechanic in the us . 
  not being sarcastic , btw , this actually happened . 
  as soon as abortion becomes legal in ireland , sure so we can re-use our `` second ireland '' ( druga irlandia ) slogans ... 
  am polish and i am all out of fucks to give about a minor detail . 
  besides , it 's not like the flag is upside down by default , just spins on mouseover ... 
  revenge for us air strikes ... in the uk . 
  not anymore , actually . 
  we 've had kebab-related scandals here in poland where the meat was being made in illegal meat processing centers ( do n't ask me how that managed to happen ... ) and the meat may not have come from a lamb or a pig ... 
  aaaaaand saved , obrigado !, 
  umm since when ? 
  did you miss the part where i wrote that he 's still a target ? 
  i get the joke but keep in mind that our president has almost no power , he 's just a glorified diplomat :p, 
  let 's hope that brexit does n't affect the eurozone 's economy too much . 
  as for economists claiming that it wo n't ... well , i 'll wait and see on that . 
  maybe he ate the journalist ? 
  read the article . 
  disappointed that it was n't the konami code or iddqd or something :p, 
  i am shocked and surprised / s, 
  their arses !, 
  show me on the doll where the evil dane touched you ... 
  guy on the right must be thinking : `` wtf is this guy doing !? '', 
  he should n't be a massive target now that he 's out of office , though . 
  still a target , of course , but i doubt he 's an important one nowadays ... 
  but it is liberal in the american sense of the word ... 
  even if we do end up taking them , there will be even more of them like a never ending amount ... 
  piracy would n't be a problem if a ) the prices for some content were n't insane b ) the drm was n't off the wall ( looking at you securom and denuvo ! ), 
  c ) the bullshit licensing that prevents content from being released in all countries at the same time ( i get sick and tired of getting my movies later or not all simply because of my geographic location ) . 
   they make a nice cheap workforce i thought that was the turks ' job ... 
  says the sardinian / s, 
  buy local , think global !, 
  not in poland ... 
  boris needs to do a video about this !, 
  it does in polish . 
  russian and german intervention , no less !, 
  ahh hello fellow dwarf fortress player ... 
  the ~ ~ jews ~ ~ swedes did this !, 
  good . 
  because the rural areas of poland tend to sometimes look like the stereotypical image people have when they think of eastern europe : poor , underdeveloped , and with shit all to do . 
  oppressed polish minority detected !, 
  this article is golden ...  ban adverts promoting `` unhealthy or unrealistic '' body images . 
   mr khan said : `` as the father of two teenage girls , i am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising which can demean people , particularly women , and make them ashamed of their bodies . 
  it is high time it came to an end . '', 
  translation : my children are lard arses who ca n't be bothered to go outside and perform some physical activity . 
  oh and this :  ** magdalena michalik ** who lives in greenwich said : `` please ban it . 
  i do n't want my children to look at it ! '', 
  the bolded name sounds very polish ... goddamn poles , going over there and complaining about being fat shamed ... 
  source please . 
  i hope you are moving to a city rather than a rural area . 
  have there been any terrorist attacks from extremist poles ? 
  what investors ? 
  low income housing does n't make money . 
   is n't a breeding ground for terrorism . 
  as of right now , no . 
  get a sizable amount of muslim immigrants , though , and we 'll see ... 
  and this is news how ? 
   there 's even japanese people in there writing in japanese `` overthrow the eu communist dictatorship '' that sounds like weaboos using google translate ... i doubt that the japanese , in general , care wtf happens in the eu ... 
  german can be beautiful ... at least when compared to dutch :d, 
  just because we can does not mean we should . 
  i do n't want my country to be another breeding ground for terrorism . 
  and just who will pay for the upkeep and the rest for that proposed apartment building ? 
  so why the hell should we accept them ? 
  because others have the ability to say `` no ! '', 
  every once in a while ? 
  so we should just make our country another country that has a `` second and third generation '' problem ? 
  i say no to that . 
   start building low income housing `` shit , they 're putting in low income housing in my area . 
  time to move ! '', 
  - everyone who ever saw low income housing get built in their decent-to-live-in area . 
  were n't they cast out of india , though ? 
  maybe in portugal pork is cheapest , i just know from my experience in poland that poultry is usually the cheapest meat available ... 
  better to have them here so in the next 18 years or so we can have more `` new europeans '' committing acts of terror on our soil ? 
  tell me , have you noticed how poland does not seem to suffer from these kind of attacks such as the one in manchester ? 
  did you not notice that we do n't have a sizable muslim minority from all over the place in this country and , thus , no ground for second and third generation terrorism ? 
  not all countries in mena are at war so they should have plenty of places to get asylum before even reaching eu borders . 
  thank goodness it does n't , i 've got things to do , no time for `` interesting times '' . 
  i wonder if one can draw a connection between poultry consumption and gdp . 
  i know poultry is popular in poland because it is * much * cheaper than beef , pork , or fish . 
  what 's a croatian ? 
  that 's where you 're wrong , kiddo.jpg, 
  i live in a big city and i do n't see terrorist attacks occur in it ...
