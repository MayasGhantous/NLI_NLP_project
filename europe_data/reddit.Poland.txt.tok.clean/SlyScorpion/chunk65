  considering that we do n't know which one is the terrorist and that we do n't want terrorism in the future from the second and third generations , it would be best to not accept any of them . 
  this is why i do n't want my country to have mena immigration . 
  why should we make our country unsafe in 18 + years when the second generation grows up ? 
  i have to wonder how many more people like this guy are in the eu just waiting to perform attacks like these ... 
  `` look at me , i 'm the bundeswehr now . '', 
  the main developer of unreal world is finnish and his game is set in an iron age finland . 
  cool game as it has tons of ancient finnish lore ... 
  https://www.wheresgeorge.com that site has been doing this with us bills since forever and there does n't seem to be anything unseemly about it . 
  besides , you would need some serious equipment to be able to forge bills properly due to all of the hidden and not-so-hidden security features they have . 
  and i think you also have assembly plants where parts are shipped from outside of mexico and assembled in mexico . 
  i seem to recall seeing some `` assembled in mexico '' labels on some cars during my time as a mechanic in the us ... 
  til that there is such a thing as a `` hand swastika '' ... 
  you mean slovorkia ? 
  meh , wake me when something is actually done about this kind of thing . 
  does anyone have a plan ? 
  people just pay under the table or something of the sort afaik ... 
  i am so glad to hear that at least one country respects the bees since without them we 'd be up shit creek ... 
  this is not exactly news , though . 
  just look at this subreddit ... 
  oh man , i chuckled out loud on the last one . 
  well done . 
  whatever is in the thames ... 
  that means it 's working ... 
   i wonder how common they really are in the us . 
  very , very common . 
  especially in the southern states . 
  source : i am currently in florida and i see tons of ham planets around here ... 
  that and the average mcdonald 's meal in the us , for example , is cheap whereas even the average burger in poland can cost 4 pln and up ... 
  they have harsh winters though ... 
  he should explain to his daughter that people like money because money is what makes the world go round ... 
  yeah , now they will have what looks to be incontrovertible proof of vote manipulation ... 
  you can try unpasteurized \u0141om\u017ca . 
  the bottle for it looks like this : https://imgur.com/a/b6ijw i like it personally . 
  idiocracy is in progress , we 're just seeing the beta version of it ... 
  `` the operation was a success but the patient died . '', 
  could apply here too , i think . 
  `` the russians hacked the minds of the vote counters !, 
  news at 11 ! '', 
  edited my comment accordingly :p, 
   are you assuming my species ? 
  of course i am , duhhhh !, 
  zywiec is kinda meh , to be honest . 
  drank enough of it to know . 
  it 's not terrible or anything ... 
  ~ ~ is n't this second time that there was an issue with the ballots/election process in austria ? ~ ~ edit : i am an idiot , mixed up my german speaking countries . 
  good man/woman/furry woodland creature . 
  are they complex or simple carbs ? 
  i thought it was the simple carbs that contributed to getting fat . 
  i go by this rule : if it 's made outside of italy , it 's `` italian-style '' food not `` italian '' food . 
  so yes , go to italy for italian food . 
  i am sure they could use the tourism euros . 
   `` goulash communism '' explain , please . 
  * sobs in latvian *, 
   czechs fatter than poles ha !, 
  i suppose . 
  ca n't really comment on it as i do n't live there , just drawing a parallel , 
  me too . 
  i love me some lasagna ... 
  there 's nothing wrong with living in a multi-generational household . 
   the average wait for an apartment in my medium sized city is 2 years that sounds like the situation we had under communism before 1989 . 
  we also had to wait x amount of years for a car . 
  there 's a movement like that ? 
  seriously ? 
  i am waiting on the chechen version of [ this movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hxnuaju78 ), 
  we still make use of coal so there you go ... 
  and some people get to split 110 million euros between themselves ... 
  neither is the pill or an iud . 
  those women are in berlin and they probably make enough money to live there and then some , what 's stopping them from getting the pill or an iud from their own pocket ? 
  ah yes i just knew it would be a video about anglish ... 
  what ? 
  they were , and continue to be , leeches on our nation . 
  `` gruba kreska '' should 've included starting over completely with new people and not former commies running things . 
  i stand by my point : they should 've hanged since they 've done nothing for this country . 
   but poland was involved in the coalition of the willing that destablized the region from which the refugee crisis now comes . 
  i think the previous poster was calling what i have quoted above the lie , not you . 
  just hazarding a guess , though . 
  would n't put it past the ruskies , to be honest . 
  and how many english words have their origins in greek ? 
  edit : wow , only 6 % ? 
  damn . 
  germany in 1941 probably knew damn well ... 
  our entire political caste should have been hanged in 1989 . 
  strong and stable !, 
  forgive my pessimism but i think it 's going to get worse . 
  the continent of africa still has a booming population in several of its countries , we still have libya being nothing more than a failed state , and we have people who are profiting greatly from smuggling people into the eu . 
  that would be just the start as i am quite sure the quota would get increased if we actually took any of them in . 
  what , you think if we redistribute the 140,000 immigrants all around the eu that this will be the end of it ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's not `` 2 syrians '' , it 's `` ok , you took in x amount and now we 'll need you to take in more '' . 
  wash and repeat, 
  it 's always a small number at first and then it will get increased little by little if we take any of the refugees in . 
  attempt to influence our politics ? 
  guys , even * syrians * do n't want refugee status if it means being a refugee in poland : http://www.rp.pl/uchodzcy/303289891-syryjczycy-nie-chca-byc-uchodzcami-w-polsce.html#ap-2 ( polish source but google translate should help you get the gist of it ... ), 
  i do n't think you 're being called a liar ...
