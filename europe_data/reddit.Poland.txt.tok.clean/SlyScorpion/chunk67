  as sceptical as i am about the eu , one should not stoop so low as to compare this meeting with hitler 's conquest of paris . 
  i dunno man ... we 're all out of royals who are even remotely related to your royals ... we can be bffs though ... 
  churchill wanted us under allied control but he got stymied somehow and stalin got us for the next 45 years so yeah ... 
  this comment makes sense if you were referring to wwii ... 
  sounds like they should read `` the prince '' . 
   paying 2000z\u0142 they are n't looking hard enough are they ? 
  i 've seen apartments go as low as 1300 pln in warsaw just by looking on services like gumtree . 
  they were n't large apartments , no , but they were great for single people ...

  to me , the horse represents le pen voters , in a way ... 
   murdered over iphones people got murdered over xboxes and air jordans in the us too so i dunno ...

  i ai n't googling that shit ...

  if automation manages to take off sometime `` soon '' it will be good to not have an excess amount of people . 
  that 's a big `` if '' , though . 
  they have a breed of horse that once a horse from that breed leaves iceland it can never come back afaik . 
  looks like spain will just have to work for douze points ... 
  because they already know the language ( yes , i know that spanish from latin america differs from mainland spanish ... ) so it 's easier to integrate them and easier for them to , hopefully , find gainful employment . 
  we have somewhat the same thing going on with ukrainians ... 
  i am all for being allowed to kill intruders in one 's home . 
  nothing wrong with that as they violated the sanctity of the home and deserve no mercy . 
  is it just me or do the gray spots resemble bullet holes ? 
  did this plane fly through a bad neighborhood ? 
   maybe we should stay out of other places ' business altogether . 
  i like this idea as i am not sure we would want the eu to intervene anywhere . 
  see how it 's turned out for the us ... 
  sounds like someone invested in ~ ~ eastern poland ~ ~ northern portugal !, 
  nice job !, 
  it 's hygge folks , believe me , it 's true !, 
  we have a 23 % vat ... 
  was n't latin american culture somewhat established by european colonization though ?

   cyber cyber what , though ? 
  cybernetics ? 
   germany itself has done it with success in 90s and now we 're in a different century/decade where people and countries are not cooperating properly anymore . 
   normally they do n't really have the right to live in other countries . 
  that has n't stopped them from sneaking out in the middle of the night towards germany or sweden ... 
  probably because they do n't want to ? 
  integration is a two-way street . 
  yeah but working in it is profitable just about anywhere if you take the cost of living in a given city into account . 
  sure , you wo n't be making tons of money east of germany but you 'll make more than enough to live a good life . 
  you 're welcome here but i doubt we 'll get many western europeans in poland . 
  are you sure they were joking ? 
  sounds terrible all the same . 
  and their kids will be pretty much polish with ukrainian surnames . 
  communism should be hated so ummm thanks us propaganda ... 
   how many portuguese abroad commited terrorist attacks ? 
  well , all those portuguese who refused to share recipes of their country 's national dishes are terrorists in my mind  . , 
   ` fleeing ' from the culture in eastern europe and just what is wrong with the culture of eastern europe ? 
  people keep mentioning that phrase almost like a buzzword but no one goes into any detail about it . 
  i 'll tell you what poland 's culture is : go to work , go to school if you are of age , church is very optional ( church attendance is dropping in poland ) , deal with the usual amount of bureaucracy when you need to get something done . 
  so it 's either force them to stay in a non-we country and have a possible humanitarian crisis or have them sneak off to germany . 
  no one is the winner in this one . 
  we have plenty , thank you . 
  now that we 've got the recipe ... 
  grats portugal !, 
  it 's blocked in the u.s. maybe ? 
  saw a lot of videos on r/europe blocked for us ips ... 
   that many people are willing to risk their very lives for a chance to make it to western europe ftfy, 
   tfw it 's time to go full caralho, 
  you missed the point ( s ) ... 
  dutch , to my untrained ears , sounds like someone trying to hack up a hairball or something .

  `` i see ~ ~ dead people ~ ~ lazy southerners ! '', 
  see my other comment , please . 
  ok i found the article in question and as i figured it 's behind a paywall ... after this sentence in the article `` co ciekawe , najwy\u017cszy poziom sprzeciwu wobec obecno\u015bci naszego kraju w ue badacze ... '' there 's a bit of text about reaching the limit for free articles and that you should subscribe to wyborcza.pl to read the rest . 
  in short , it looks like you are missing anywhere from 50-75 % of the article . 
  [ this is the image i had in mind when referring to `` the new europeans '' ] ( http://imgur.com/r0vuhiw ) sorry was on a phone earlier and i do n't use the imgur app on it because i ca n't stand some apps ... 
  there * should * be more , yes . 
  can i get a link , please ? 
  oh ughh ... they did that clickbait shit at the end ... 
  it almost looks like poland stole all of romania 's gains with the 448 surplus and their 448 deficit ... 
  poland being a member of the eu has an 83 % approval rating from poles . 
  according to the latest polls , the greatest amount of pro-eu sentiment can be found in the 35-44 age group . 
  the next age group that is supportive of the eu is 45-64 age group ( 84 % polled ) . 
  12 % of people polled were against the eu . 
  the last sentence in your quoted post is rather incomplete , though ... 
  he only managed to `` beat '' the nazis by simply throwing quite a few russians to the meat grinder aka the biggest zerg rush in history . 
  that 's why the russians/soviets had so many casualties ... 
  not in * my * country , you ... you * swede * !, 
  no , you 're not the only one ... 
  in poland we had a kebab scandal where it was found that some kebab places ( not sure if they were polish-owned or not ) were using meat made from very questionable sources ... 
  article in polish but it 's short so google translate should help : http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/mieso-do-kebabow-z-czelusci-centralnego,143218.html, 
  yeah but `` kurwa '' is used in just about the same context as `` fuck '' tends to be . 
  so , sure , the meaning is `` whore '' but context-wise it can be anything . . `` co jest , kurwa ? '', 
  can translate to `` the fuck is up ? '', 
  or `` what the fuck do you want ? '', 
  i imagine `` caralho '' can be used in the same fashion ... 
  ehh , i 'd rather not have these kind of transfers as i can not see our government , no matter who is in power , making good use of that kind of money . 
  also , i 'd prefer a net contributor poland rather than a net receiver poland ...
