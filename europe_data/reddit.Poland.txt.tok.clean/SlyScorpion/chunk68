  damn brits !, 
  they ruined britain !, 
  350 million pounds a week !, 
  i love that ~ ~ sketch ~ ~ bit !, 
  our government is against mass immigration and they * bitch * about the eu but they do n't take any concrete actions against the eu as they know damn well that without the eu funds we would still be poor as hell ... 
  ok , whoever gifted me the gold , thank you very much but seriously you did not need to do this ... 
  so fenno-syrians ? 
  please yell in some other language so the rest of us can move on with our day !, 
  but you did see the cover i mentioned ? 
  ca n't annex the rest of ukraine with australia in the way . 
   paying cash money for reddit, 
  well , we use `` burak '' for the rural version because polish rural people tend to have beet red faces from working on the land , heavy drinking , or both . 
  `` burak '' is the polish word for `` beet '' . . 
  welllll ... `` dres '' is used for the city version of a redneck . 
  `` burak '' is for the rural version ... 
  we have the local versions for `` redneck '' such as `` gopnik '' in russian or `` dres '' , `` burak '' , or `` buc '' in polish . 
  i wonder if finland will stop collecting these statistics like one or two other countries did ... 
  true , true ... 
   duda lol the president of poland is , for the most part , a glorified diplomat , quite powerless outside of putting the parliament together . 
  yeah , it 's a tradition dating back to the early 17th or 16th century ... 
  but brownies are food ... 
  leader ship . 
  go to google . 
  type `` the new europeans '' in the search bar . 
  after your search is complete , click on `` images '' . 
  the educated ones go to richer countries to make 3 to 5 times more than they would if they had stayed . 
   not using `` caralho '' you had one job ... 
  the jig is up , mr. lowe !, 
  if it exists you can try amazon.cz i think ... 
  yes , very much like a pissed off tire that 's deflating :p, 
  at least you found the missing floppies , now where is the game !? 
  well ... not with * that * attitude !, 
  edited my post . 
  hope that makes some sense ... 
  they 're coming for polandball , i heard !, 
  i would watch it if i could hear songs in all of the languages in , well , europe . . fun fact : if you 're not versed in either polish or portuguese , they sound remarkably similar :d ( portuguese-pt sounds to me like what polish must sound to people who do not speak a word in polish ... ), 
  from your link it seems they take it seriously for propaganda reasons . 
  sad , really . 
  pffft , at least merkel visited us rather than the other way around :p, 
  is this true or is there an / s missing at the end of your post ? 
  strong and stable !, 
  have you seen that one magazine cover titled `` the new europeans '' ? 
  chances are this imam is probably a citizen of denmark which means you ca n't deport him to another country because he 's a `` new european '' . 
  yeah we did have that but guess what , we no longer have native europeans doing so ( with the exception being fringe far right parties whose message is largely ignored by the general public ... ) , now we get these imported `` new europeans '' calling for the killing of jews . 
  in short , we learned our lesson , too bad other societies have not . 
  so why do we want to import islam into europe again ? 
  jealous i bet ... :p, 
  he has to go pick up the medpack , eh ? 
  yes , we 've gone full arsztotzka around here yep ... 
  estonia = literally who ? 
  our pl politicians are too busy making fools of themselves on the international stage . 
  i have windows 10 installed on my laptop . 
  i do n't think they need to install anything else ... 
  then you 'll have to raise taxes to pay for the additional police forces . 
  last time i read a book on a flight , i got severe motion sickness . 
  thank fuck i 'll be in florida for the next two months :d, 
  if you ban laptops and tablets wtf are people supposed to do on those 10 + hour flights ? 
  also , i hope this means i can still bring my laptop on my flight in a few hours as i ai n't going to just sit there with nothing to take my mind off the long ass flight ... 
  get outta here with your double digit celsius degeneracy !, 
  we can barely afford being above 0 !, 
  it 's `` schmuck '', 
  in today 's episode of `` maps without new zealand '' ... 
  5 % nice landscapes , 2.5 % architecture and the other 2.5 % is all about dem cows ... 
  huge population , i think . 
  might as well go along with the archaic spelling with `` reading gaol '' ... 
  how has what changed the cultivation of rice ? 
  bugger off with the ussr . 
  i think some of us would prefer to remain in the eu , warts and all ... 
  actually , greenland was the first to leave :p, 
  how else are you going to repatriate them into general society if you keep them unemployed after they 've served their time ? 
  you forgot alan turing ... 
  did italy have anything remotely similar to brexit happen in their country ? 
  besides , berlusconi 's not in power ( afaik ) so i do n't think he 's a threat anymore ... 
  i have never heard of this `` britian '' ... 
  so no tendies ? 
  sounds like an apt description of a john oliver episode ... 
   covered by insurance what car insurance in the eu covers mechanical failure once a car is out of its warranty period ? 
  i am genuinely curious as i 've worked with insurance companies as a mechanic and they only covered collisions and not parts wearing out and the car breaking down . 
  btw have you heard about brexit today ? 
  ( sorry , i just had to ... ), 
  your post about ubi is remarkably similar to this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbp6umqt58a ( it 's `` the story of your enslavement '' by stefan molyneux ), 
  ehhh , you can already order a whole bunch of groceries to your door nowadays without even needing to leave the house . 
  i know because a co-worker of mine does this ... 
  poland kinda had that already although it was the communist version aka ussr but i think i get your point . 
  i 'd rather just give them a one way ticket to those `` full socialist '' ( inb4 `` it 's not real socialism !, 
  reeeee ! '' ), 
  places and send them there until further notice . 
  i ask myself this everyday . 
  brexit is none of my business when it comes to being for or against it but by god i am tired of hearing about it day in , day out . 
  edit : formatting and grammar . 
   full socialist why , so we can have venezuela in europe ? 
  strong and stable leader ship, 
  farage was n't part of the official leave campaign though as odd as that sounds . 
  last i recall the brexiteers did not give a fig about whether other countries wanted to stay or leave , they were mostly concerned with the uk leaving . 
  in short , this comic is barking up the wrong tree . 
   uncivilised drunken stealing poles immigrated to western germany since the 1840s ca n't be any worse than the time germans decided it was time to fire up the ovens , eh ? 
  it 's a wikipedia link but whites are n't even the majority in south africa : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_south_africa if i am reading the statistics and figures correctly . 
  i am no expert on this but maybe it 's because you do n't see this in countries you could call , for lack of a better term , non-white ? 
  for example , white people are not changing the demographics of african countries or countries in asia . 
  the majority of the population in those countries is still the same population that 's been living there for 1000 's of years .
