  or am i thinking of the wrong european country ? 
   if the check is under $ 5 or $ 10 yeah , we have a similar thing in poland where if you are buying something like 5 pln worth of goods , you can not pay by card . 
  also , a lot of places will not allow you to pay just for cigarettes by card so you have to get something else if you want a pack of smokes . 
   article by harry cockburn this does n't sound legit ... 
  not sure if serious or trolling ... 
  thanks , that worked ... all too well as i am hungry for those exact tacos now :p, 
  can you post that pic on imgur ? 
  keep getting `` connection reset '' errors when clicking on that link ... 
  so may i ask for a short summary of the two parties , if that 's at all possible ? 
  i do n't know much about spanish politics and since google translate is horrible i thought i 'd ask a native , 
  alright so what is the spanish version of a socialdemocrat party , then ? 
  i do n't know spanish at all and it would be interesting to see what the common platform ( s ) is ( are ) for the sd parties in spain . 
  why does spain tolerate socialists ? 
  mexican gamers : do you prefer your games localized or in english ? 
  so where 's the toy mexican and is the toy life size ? 
  here 's hoping that gwent does the same ... 
  man , now i need some authentic mexican hot sauce . 
  not even the super hot stuff , just anything that is spicier than what poland has : /, 
  yeah , just think of it like a soviet russia joke `` in soviet mexico taco turns you ! '', 
   spaguetti taco i am waiting for italians to get triggered by this jajajaja, 
  that kind of defeats the purpose of a cultural exchange , no ? 
  what 's your opinion on sriracha sauce ? 
  ok so eating a taco is slightly different than the ol' kebab  here 's how i eat my tacos ( talking about hard tacos ) : 1 . 
  hold the taco straight up , do not turn the taco . 
  turn your head left or right as if you were trying to read something that is somewhat off center . 
  bite the evil taco with your head turned . 
  if you want to prevent the meat falling from the back of the taco you can kind of nibble on that end and then get back to the end you were going to eat on . 
   poland is still on this corruption list it 's getting better ... slowly ... sort of ... * nervous laughter *, 
  not a mexican but have eaten tacos and met mexicans before . 
  does the meat fall from the side or the end opposite of that which you are eating ? 
  sounds better than our surprise expression `` o kurwa ! '', 
  well , there * was * that one berlin wall  . , 
  sorry about the misspelling there and thanks for the clarification , 
  our national team may have lost a world cup match from the looks of it . 
  what does `` horale '' mean ? 
  ( i know i am missing an accented letter somewhere ... ), 
  sovereignty . 
  350 million british pounds for muh nhs . 
  immigrants . 
  jobs . 
  more immigrants . 
  the issue is far more complex than just some buzzwords but those were some of the key issues mentioned during the whole brexit campaign . 
  too late !, 
  poland is the mexico of europe , we did it already !, 
  you have n't seen lefty / pol / then ... 
  maybe not to the same extent as russia but yeah , we do hear of it now and then ... 
  it might not be shit but it has weird names ... `` spotted dick '' sounds more like an affliction than something you would eat :p, 
  maybe but only we can say that about ourselves ... ca n't have some johnny foreigners doing it for us !, 
  welcome to the club . 
  do you have the `` they ride polar bears to work ! '', 
  stereotype too ? 
  that stereotype travelled from germany to the u.s. so it has roots in europe . 
  those drone sound effects ... * bbbzzzzzzzzzzz * splat !, 
  confirmation bias confirmed  . , 
  that 's what * they * want you to think !, 
  that 's swedes and danes ... 
  to the rhythm of `` du hast '' no less ... 
  i hate the stereotype that we 're all dumb . 
  sweden and the rest of the world taught me that iceland is friends with the lava demons ... 
  this old sonofabitch is running a car shop !,

  where exactly do people just randomly shout the word `` nazi ! '', 
  at you , though ? 
  not disbelieving you but i find it odd that people would just do that kind of thing these days ... 
  wiping the sweat of your brow with 100 eur notes is much hard very difficult wow ... 
  do n't you need more jobs to generate that money , though ? 
  and more effective than captain sweden .

  the article mentions shots being fired from an audi so who knows ? 
  maybe a camera caught the license plate of that car ... 
  but did the economic outlook for the village improve ? 
  seems like even though they are successful at integrating refugees how are they going to keep people there if there 's no work to be found ? 
  we have taken in refugees but a majority of them would just flee to germany and western europe in general .
