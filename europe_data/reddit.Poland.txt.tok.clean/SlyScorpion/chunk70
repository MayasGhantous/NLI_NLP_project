   do you think that 's comparable with everything russia potentially does covertly ? 
  i do n't and never did ... 
  i do n't think it should take its cues from less free places but i also do n't think we should allow countries like qatar to build mosques on european soil . 
  let them build their mosque in their country for all i care . 
  alright , that 's cool ... now , is anyone building a church of equal or larger size in qatar ? 
   what have the votes done ? 
  followed the legal process of expressing dissent with the system instead of fighting in the streets like a bunch of uncouth yobs ?

  we ran out of money to wage a war against those dastardly portuguese who stepped on soil labelled as `` not portugal caralho '' ...

  what about a grey jedi for macron ? 
  switzerland is not part of the eu , though . 
  how 's that any different than all the mosques springing up in other countries ? 
   347 readers, 
  some countries , like the us , have paid vacation time but it 's not federally mandated like it is in europe , hence the reason you only see `` 0 '' when it comes to paid vacations on this map . 
   if you want a system where you can pay your way before others , emigrate to usa . 
  we have that ... it 's private healthcare , just like anywhere else ... 
  would you say he 's another hollande ? 
  he said this as a private citizen . 
  he has no power anymore , bit of a difference .

  i ca n't find one ... maybe in 2 years we 'll get proper subs for that : /, 
  what 's the `` mini-maneuver '' , if i may ask ? 
  not sure if that 's a local thing or an eu parliament thing ... 
   of course it depends what exactly you keep hearing ... mostly that after the fall of communism , everything was in freefall when it comes to business law so there was a lot of `` samowolka '' when it came to commerce . . 
  [ pis got 37 % of the vote in 2015 ] ( http://parlament2015.pkw.gov.pl/349_wyniki_sejm ) ( polish language source ) and compared to the opposition , po , it was by a slim margin that they were voted in so i would n't be so quick to resort to the `` your country voted for pis so you can not presume to share any values that * decent * european countries share '' line of defense . 
  also , we 'll be voting again in 2018 and with the way things are going now and the growing dissatisfaction with the pis government , i am sure we 'll have a government in place that everyone can agree with on the international stage . 
  i do n't know what news outlets you read and how they paint poland but do note that not everything is as it seems around here . 
  only saying so because i , unlike you , actually live here . 
   i think part of the reason we 're more scared now is that we see every attack immediately in very close up detail , and being more mobile we 've likely been to at least one or two places an attack has taken place . 
  agree 100 % . 
   the fact that they 're resorting to trucks and knives rather than guns and bombs suggests that the security services are doing an excellent job . 
  and with each attack they learn more . 
  for every one attack that takes place , several more are prevented . 
  i see it as `` it 's a lot more difficult to know when they will strike since trucks are used in everyday life so they are n't controlled the same as firearms '' . 
  i do get where you 're coming from but i do hope you can take into account the availability of trucks and knives , to a lesser extent , when compared to firearms . 
  tl ; dr it 's a lot easier to get a truck and blend in than go around with an ak-47 ...  the touted solution of `` banning '' or `` sending back '' muslim populations would only add fuel to the fire , and play into the narrative that isis and other terrorist groups are desperate for . 
  the problem is : what do you do with muslim populations that either a ) ca n't integrate because they get stuffed into camps or b ) refuse to integrate for whatever reason ? 
  you ca n't send them back because that gives fuel for anti-west propaganda and yet keeping them here just raises the chances of homegrown terrorists , at least that 's how i see it but i am interested in your take on this , if you do n't mind . 
  central european . 
  oh you lived through the re-denomination , how was that ? 
  i keep hearing the 90s were a horrible time in poland ... 
  hey , you forgot [ this xbox hueg version of jesus ] ( http://nickt.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/jezus-swiebodzin-raw-56.jpg ), 
   there were still marxist groups , far right groups and all sorts of plane hijackings . 
  not denying that at all . 
   core western values i would like to see a definitive collection of those values . 
  also , how do we know that our values will remain the same in the face of repeated and , to me anyways , almost untraceable terrorist plans since , these days , you never know who will decide to drive a truck through a crowd of people . 
  apologies if i sound like i am fear mongering , it 's not my intent , but i do hope you see my point . 
  thanks !, 
  [ it 's the flag of the voivodeship where i live ] ( https://www.mazovia.pl/gfx/mazovia/userfiles/_public/wojewodztwo/flaga_wm.jpg ), 
  do n't worry , the last years of commie times were really shitty . 
  i mean shittier than all the other ones since it was waning very much . 
  hey , at least you missed having to be sent out by your parents as a kid to wait for 3-4 hours for bread on a saturday :p, 
  in 1984 , i just found out that 10,000 plz ( old polish zloty for the non-poles ) was equal to about 1 us dollar so i had no idea what was going on politically at the time ... 
  while the attacks may be less common , they 're also less centralized . 
  what i mean is that , back in the day , people in france or germany did not have to worry about an attack by the ira or eta because those organizations limited their attacks to their respective countries . 
  now , we do n't exactly know when or where isis/isil / < fill in the name of an islamic terror group here  will strike . 
  i am not an expert but i would like to see whether it 's because the younger generation is more susceptible to being recruited over the internet by isis/isil or whatever islam-based terror organization . 
  i would n't be surprised if it 's not something similar as to how people get recruited by far right extremists ... 
  well , i doubt those `` refugees welcome '' people will flee here . 
  it will be like americans who are so pissed off at trump that they will move to canada but not mexico aka they 'll only move to an equal or richer country . 
  that and the language barrier will be sufficient at keeping them away ... 
  from what i 've seen here in this subreddit , it 's not the first generation immigrants that are the problem , it 's the second or third generation for some odd reason . 
  right then . 
  poland : too poor for you , nothing for you here ... no jobs , racism , evil catholics roam the streets ... ( is it working ? ),

  u/solewanderer must be living in one of the worse off portions of poland that have been neglected by the government after the fall of communism . 
  poland is not a shitty east european country . 
  while we are n't norway , we 're far away from whatever preconceived notion you may have about the country . 
  i left the us which , according to most people , is a decent country to live in and now i live in poland and i could n't be happier . 
  because you 're expecting the eu to just magically cure your ills ?
