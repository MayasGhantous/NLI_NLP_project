  taxation is one thing but let 's hope the tax euros end up in the right place . 
  bono estente, 
  just like new zealand . 
  i have no idea , perhaps it 's a dogwhistle for something ? 
  i can see her doing that ... `` hey you , belgium is it ? , drop the euro and use your own currency instead . 
  it 's a solid deal , believe me , it 's bigly ! '', 
  the franc is the euro . 
  we are at war with eurasia .

  freedom is slavery ... 
  errrrrmmm ... . `` france stronk ! '' ? 
  is all i can think of , really ... 
  hungarian , actually . 
  and eulogies ... 
  i think she meant that businesses would use the euro between themselves on the larger market and people would use francs in france . 
  so , basically , people would get paid in french francs in france , they would pay for goods and services in french francs all the while the businesses would use the euro to do business between themselves . 
  that 's how i interpreted it but keep in mind i was listening to a real-time translation so there may be some details that got lost ... 
  we have two leaders : [ one is the pm and one is the pm 's owner ] ( http://imgur.com/a/0xnpp ),

  i remember returning to poland in 2010 after 20 + years of , well , not being in poland and here we are with a trump presidency and a * potential * le pen in the french president 's office in 2017 . 
  i am a bit of a pessimist and i think we 'll get the chinese curse within the next 5 years . 
  and as long as a le pen manages to reproduce via mitosis ... 
  yeah but they 'll be like mushrooms after the rain once brexit is formally over . 
  come on guys , she was just illustrating how the whole `` one france , two currencies '' thing was going to work out / s, 
  we 'll see in 2022 , i think that 's the next election in france , right ? 
  well ... 
  i am partially deaf , can not understand the language being translated , i wanted to get a decent idea as to what both candidates were talking about as i do n't know much about french politics . 
  the last thing i needed was to have a side show with the translation . 
  you 're not going to find the black zero in greece , it 's an arabic number !,

  i meant : what was she speaking about when she started tripping balls ? 
  wtf was that ? 
  i missed that part ... 
  it 's too late , it 's going to keep on happening all the way until brexit happens and then we 'll get `` the uk is doooooooooomed ! '', 
  articles from then on ... 
  germany : le pen 's `` chyna ! '', 
  my apologies , i should 've clarified : the socialists ' policies , while they were in power , * may * have contributed in some part to the problems that france is facing today . 
  i was addressing the general `` blame the socialists '' portion of the previous post , not my intention to include macron . 
   we wo n't have daily `` eu end is nigh !!! '', 
  articles no , we 'll just get more brexit articles : /,

  you mean `` automation '' , right ? 
  does anyone in the french political scene have any idea to fix the `` issues '' , then ? 
  serious question because it looks like , from an outsider 's perspective mind you , that everyone seemed to be of the mindset `` things will go on as before but we 'll say something to make it sound like we are going to do something '' . 
  why ? 
  he 's nothing more , to me , than a pen with a human being attached to it .

  in some slavic languages `` kurka '' means `` small or young chicken '' or a [ particular type of mushroom ] ( http://www.odzywianie.info.pl/img/stories/arts/_665x/kurki-kalorie-i-wartosci-odzywcze.jpg ), 
   \u012e sneaky lithuanian . . dropping your alphabet like that , thinking we wo n't notice / s, 
  and those capable locals are going away , most never to return . 
  kind of a chicken and egg problem , if you ask me . 
   not even the labour party would commit political suicide i am not sure but i keep reading responses from uk redditors about their labour party and how they seem to be politically useless/idiotic/incompetent / < insert negative adjective here  these days so who knows maybe they can add `` political suicide '' to their list of anti-achievements ?
