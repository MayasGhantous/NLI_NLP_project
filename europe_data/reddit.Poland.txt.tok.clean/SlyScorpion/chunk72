  you mean formally ? 
  not much if at all ... 
   v e r i - t r a n s, 
  verified bigly . . 
   `` hey grandma , whatchu thinkin ' about ? '', 
   `` oh just dialectical materialism and the plight of the working classes ! '', 
  i see what you did there ... 
  gandhi seemed to find a non-violent way to get heard ... 
  that depends on where that wealth is getting `` redistributed '' to in the first place . 
  warsaw where we get the onr marching every november 11th ... 
  i like to consider the fact that angela merkel visited poland to try and talk things out as a positive one ... 
  i think if there were serious problems she would n't have come here but i am no expert on the matter ... 
  such is life in post-soviet economy ... 
  i would download a car ... easier than going to germany to steal one  . , 
  only in self defense though . 
  if they beat up the antifa just because then they legitimize them ... 
   got grabbed from behind and beat up so what caused them to grab you in the first place ? 
  afaik , unless you 're in a very corrupt country , police do n't just randomly grab people from behind and beat them up ... 
  i do n't know what experiences you had with the police but i 've had some myself and i never thought to myself `` damn , i wish someone would set those guys on fire ... '', 
   is this another one of those threads that will descend into the usual , `` they 're not nazis , only nationalist patriots '' circlejerk ? 
  of course it is . 
  and if you notice , this group comes with its own upvote arrows :d, 
  borscht ( my gawd , call it `` barszcz '' you heathens ! ), 
  is rightful polish cuisine !, 
  it might be that it 's something you ca n't transport easily without ruining the quality , not sure . 
  not only do we have antifa in poland but they sometimes invite the german antifa to come out and play ... 
  ayyyyy, 
  ah you could be right ... i do n't have a perfect memory ... 
  life with no chance of parole . 
  nuke the pc . 
  you could say it was ... brutal . 
  it 's been used in every episode where they mentioned his name . 
  now try that with reddit 's teeny tiny flags ... 
  have you been watching the chaiman 's ear or something ? 
  there is also the republic of serbia flag ( republika srpska ) . 
  looks kinda like the russian flag at first glance but then [ it comes at you looking like this ] ( http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/images/b/ba-rs.gif ) all the while the russian flag [ looks like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/f/f3/20120812153730%21flag_of_russia.svg ), 
  america is n't in the eu , though . 
  i personally doubt it does since 99 % of western europe ( correct me if i am wrong ) has not actually experienced communism . 
  the 1 % is reserved for the former east germany ... 
  you guys also have the ocean right next to you and that can create humid conditions where even though it 's a reasonable temperature outside you still feel colder because of the humidity . 
  i lived in florida which is surrounded by the ocean and winters were horrible there because you could not put on enough clothes to get warm since the humidity would just make you colder . 
  because they might be young enough to not have lived under a communist regime so they idealize it and think `` it 'll be different this time !, 
  are n't they freezing at this point ? 
  :p surely they ca n't be used to such barbaric weather as 15 degrees celsius ? 
  threat level : invent a time machine . 
  it 's like an antediluvian returning in vampire : the masquerade ... 
  i would like the eu to somehow fix the monetary policy so that if a country starts failing financially it does not threaten to bring down the whole works , whatever the outcome . 
  i mean look at greece with its financial issues and how any article that mentions as much always pairs it with `` the potential collapse of the european union '' or something along those lines . 
  for example , why is it that when michigan kind of went to the dogs in the us , the only people who were most affected were the people living in the state ? 
  i remember living in florida at the time and it literally made no difference to me , i did not have to worry about the us collapsing if michigan did not recover . 
  is it because the us has more `` member states '' to kind of absorb the financial shock of one member state going down or what ? 
  cool , thanks for the reply . 
  hi , how do posts like this qualify when they are just an image without any sort of submission statement https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68hul2/wonders_of_the_portuguese_language_caralho/ ( if i am reading the rules correctly , a submission statement is something that describes the post a bit and gives some background info ... ), 
  your link is kinda broken ... 
  by buggering off somewhere else for a few days ... 
   grand romantic gestures like talking yep , talking is highly overrated . 
  because that would kill the joke ... 
  hell yeah , an extra day off . 
  time to do absolutely nothing at all ... 
  what in the bloody hell is a `` demoliberal '' ? 
  are you making a portmanteau ? 
  there is a hugo boss store in warsaw ( might be more than one but since i do n't shop for fancy clothes i would n't know ... ), 
   1,5 million american euros how much is that in [ ameros ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_monetary_union ), 
  in russian it 's '' \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d \u0413\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 '' so yeah pretty damn similar ... 
  i can say that your posts in this very thread are hate speech . 
  prove that they are n't . 
  basically , the point i am trying to make is that you may * think * it 's possible to properly define hate speech but i would n't put it past any government to start bending the rules as to what `` hate speech '' actually means . 
  i have no idea but if i were to pick the most popular ones being espoused by people of a particular bent it would either be `` mass immigration '' and `` the eu '' or as they like to call it `` the eussr '' ... 
   a sejm where any noble is allowed to veto well ... we kinda have that already since everyone in the sejm is richer than most nobles back in the day :p obviously , no one individual in the sejm can actually veto a bill due to the balance of powers but i believe they can hold up the process some ... 
   you have to be an absolute moron to be a fascist or communist quoting u/kacu5610 and adding to the post before mine ... 
  so why were they supposedly `` saving jews '' ( to quote u/altnume21 ) during the war ? 
  [ i 'd say 31,000 at least ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_poland ), 
  and communism overstayed its welcome here and killed off quite a few of our people here as well with the secret police and all ... tl ; dr communism and nazism are both bad . 
  she 's just there making sure her grandson is well-fed and dressed ... 
   ordered hollande and it 's this kind of hearsay that feeds the narrative `` zee germans run the eu !, 
  i like how she 's slowly hiding the words `` stability security opportunity '' ... 
  attack of the blondes !, 
  playing now in an eu near you !, 
  [ and now you have ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/18b95t.jpg ), 
  is it anschluss zeit already ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl6adrzs3fs ), 
  the people who may have been neutral towards jews may have been simply replaced by natural causes such as death of old age . 
  now , we have a generation of anti-semites in the ranks of onr . 
  `` paramilitary '' is the term i think you 're looking for , no such term as `` para militia '' , 
   a lot of asians do not know anything about the other users of the swastka . 
  twenty years ago that might 've been true but these days we have internet access just about everywhere save for very rural areas and mountains ( afaik ) . 
  we did n't suffer because of fascists , rather , it was national socialists from germany . 
  ( obviously , there 's more to that but you get my drift , i hope . ), 
  now , if you said `` nazi poles ?!?! '', 
  then i would have agreed with you . 
  even within the same family !, 
  dumb question but how does one `` exercise '' a nationality ? 
  do you need to take it for walks ? 
  ah so definitely commie times ... 
   kingkong i laughed a bit at the url as well as the site ... 
   during the russian revolution russia did not have nukes or an expanded security apparatus at that time like they do now . 
  i am not saying the americans are beyond meddling within russia but i doubt it will be easy to do so without comprising themselves i.e. 
  getting caught in the act . 
  does n't look all that empty now , though ...
