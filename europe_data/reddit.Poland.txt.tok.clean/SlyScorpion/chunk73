  * communist poland if the ship is hella old . 
  if it 's recently built then i dunno , we dun goofed . 
  goddamn lochness monster , get outta my house !, 
  no refunds !, 
  i am worried we 'll just get another pis but with a different name . 
  microns ... 
  just align your compass westwards and you 'll hit paris . 
  there 's nothing for you in the east ... totally nothing at all ... 
  serious question : how much of that unemployment was exported via the younger generation leaving the country to look for work elsewhere ? 
  going to roll into paris like the last time ? 
  perhaps . . the carpathian mountains ? 
  looks like someone dredged up sealand ... 
  has n't article 50 been officially triggered , though ? 
  or did i miss a step ? 
  i am curious , what does it mean in south africa ? 
  it was those damned jehova 's witnesses ... get it right , please :p, 
  well , it depends on whether it 's being reported or not . 
  i keep hearing rumors that some reports get repressed but since i can not provide sources the rumors will remain just that : rumors . 
  not trying to start an argument , just saying what i 've been hearing about , that 's all . 
  they should have been enforced back when orban just started acting up ... 
   poles immigrating to the west they had every legal right to do so thanks to the four freedoms the eu provides . 
  eu citizens are also free to emigrate to poland if they so choose ( yes , yes and then you 're going to say `` but why would anyone migrate there ? 
  '' , right ? 
  i understand but i just wanted to make a point . 
  i would be in 100 % agreement if the posted worker directive was of polish origin as that shit that you described earlier sounds shady as hell when it comes to taxation and all ... 
  thank you finnbro !, 
   you do n't have this kind of houses in poland ? 
  really ? 
  we do n't have migrant centers or blocks or whatever housing units they get pushed into . 
  we had churches offer asylum and such but the migrants ( once they decided to hightail it out of poland they became migrants , imho ) would just bugger off to germany or elsewhere . 
  we even had towns housing some families amongst the natives . 
  frankly speaking , i do n't want our country to have [ this kind of shit happening on our soil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h15hszv5yg ), 
   what does that have to do with the eu in this context ? 
  i am not that poster but * perhaps * it has something to do with perceived strongarming but in a less direct way than the ussr ? 
  i do n't know , just guessing . 
  you just ordered 1000 liters of ~ ~ milk ~ ~ beer !, 
  wrong country , i know , but i could n't help it ... 
   constantly blocking any form of change like orban does how is that any different from what the uk was doing , to put it simply ? 
  hello putin ... / s, 
   posted workers directive literally a case of `` do n't hate the player , hate the game '' . 
  poland did not make that directive . 
  if it concerns you that much why not write to your representative in the eu parliament ? 
  such is life ... 
  the uk will be out of the eu soon so the macron/schulz harridans will have no way to piss and moan in the uk 's general direction . 
  poland does not have state sponsored campaigns against brussels . 
  oh the politicians will bitch and moan about brussels but that 's as far as it goes . 
  to top it all off , the majority of poles see it for the bullshit rhetoric it actually is . 
  just wanted to illustrate one of the many differences between poland and hungary . 
  nothing can save us . 
  better nuke from orbit to be sure . 
  itt : arrogant frenchmen two can play this game . 
  good luck but we are n't going anywhere , 
  lol . 
  and i will counter that france and germany get away with much more shit but they get no punishment `` because france is france '' and all that . 
  well , how else do you want me to reply to the accusations that we do n't have a free press or something ? 
  they are still free to do as they wish and this is concerning the independent news outlets . 
  sorry but you ca n't pin a turkey situation on us , no matter how much you try . 
  make it ~ ~ 28 ~ ~ 27 for the full eu effect . 
  we contribute cheap skilled labor and a medium-to-large market ( 38 million , more or less , consumers ) for quite a few french companies . 
  that `` poland does n't contribute anything '' argument does not fly . 
  ehh i would be more inclined to label our `` factories '' as `` assembly plants '' since individual parts get manufactured elsewhere and the end product is assembled in poland . 
  our wanted level just jumped to 5 stars ... 
  we were asking for it too ... 
  or leclerc or leroy merlin ... 
   paper trail how 's that any different than using a debit card ? 
  `` all animals are equal but some are more equal than others '' i get your point but i do n't like it ( the point , not talking about your post ) . 
   poland to refuse taking any refugees how many times am i going to have to state that any refugees we would have taken in would not stay here since we do n't have calais-style camps for them ? 
  i certainly wish that our government would have done more to help frontex or something proactive rather than reactive . 
   sure we 'll take fines for breaking eu rules [ except for france because it 's ... france ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-deficit-france-idukkcn0ym1n0 ) unrelated i know but i hope you see my point that `` all animals are equal but some are more equal than others '' when it comes to the rules of the eu . 
  just so you know , i too want cooperation but it has to be done right and not appear as if the bigger countries were telling the smaller ones what to do like macron is currently trying to do ... 
  it 's just bants , m80 . 
  because we are n't in the same camp . 
  we have the following :  freedom of expression and dissent evidence : the black protests and the committee for the defense of democracy ( kod ) . 
   free press evidence : we have independent news outlets as well state-owned media outlets . 
  while our current party is not perfect , we will be voting soon ( in 2018 iirc ) and they have a high chance of being voted out . 
  i do n't know what exactly constitues a `` liberal state '' but i 'll tell you , as someone who lives here , we are not what the press makes us out to be . 
  because france is france ... 
   they still use cheques you 're kidding , right ? 
  my bad . 
  edited my comment for clarity . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67yni6/french_wouldbe_president_macron_says_would_seek/ hey look there it is again  . , 
  we went there as support for the americans but not in any sizeable capacity . 
  [ we sent 2,300 troops ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3043330.stm ) in assistance . 
  ~ ~ in fact , hungary and estonia sent more troops than us according to [ this paper ] ~ ~ ( http://paks.uni-duesseldorf.de/dokumente/paks_working_paper_9_rev.pdf ) . 
  edit : in a hurry , read paper wrong . 
  mmmmm yes . 
  all we need is for macron and schultz to get elected and we 'll be getting the dynamic duo who will be bitching at poland and hungary all day , every day . 
  at least angela made a visit to try and talk things out rather than going all heavy handed with the sanctions ... 
  seriously , if you only go by reddit 's thought on the matter , you would think we have secret police disappearing people around here or something :p in any case , it 's not as bad as it seems but there 's always room for improvement , 
  oh , i do n't doubt for a moment that this is all a smoke screen of some sorts . 
  besides , poland and hungary are easy targets since we 're not economic powerhouses like germany or the uk . 
  i bet if we were on that level he would be kissing our ass just like the eu did when trying to convince the uk to not leave the eu . 
   the eu bashes our government the polls for law and justice go up the `` rally around the flag '' effect in action ... 
  [ might as well be this for all i know ] ( http://i.imgur.com/byfe4pi.png ), 
  they do n't count apparently . 
   forcing poland to increase wages artificially , costing them thousands of jobs try millions . 
  we already have small-to-mid size businesses unable to pay the various taxes levied on them ( the tax to fund our social security system aka zus is sometimes enough to drive a business to close its doors ) . 
  i ca n't imagine them suddenly having to pay more when they can not get more money to pay the suddenly higher wages ... edit : changed `` nhs '' to `` social security system '' because our nhs gets funded in a different way , afaik . 
  the press can still write negatively about the government and they do . 
  freedom of expression and dissent is still alive and well .
