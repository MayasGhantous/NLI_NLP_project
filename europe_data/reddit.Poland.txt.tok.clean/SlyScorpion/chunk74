  we have kod ( committee for the defense of democracy is the best way to translate it ) which is made up of po and other parties ' members . 
  they stage protests and all kinds of goings on in between various scandals that plague kod such as misappropriation of funds and prostitution ( no , i am not kidding ) . 
  following up on the freedom of expression , please look up the black protests that happened here a few months ago . 
  oh yes , we even have a youtube series by one of poland 's top cabaret performers where he plays kaczynski and makes him look like a backwards person ( they depict kaczynski as not knowing any languages besides polish , relying on outdated industries such coal mining to prop up the polish economy and more ) . 
  i wo n't say we are without problems because pis * is * trying their best to undermine the democratic process but we 're also not a police state or north korea tier ... 
  better than a blue waffle ( do n't google that if you value your sanity and your lunch ... ), 
  and ketchup ... 
  [ about those jobs ... ] ( https://pics.onsizzle.com/oh-get-a-job-just-getajobp-why-dontistrapon-my-job-helmet-6852186.png ), 
  nie = no nein = no niein = germanlish in action . . 
  because neither russia or belarus are part of the eu-28 ... 
  i am just waiting for the days when all of the old political cronies just die off finally , at least that way we can be sure they wo n't be in power anymore . 
   social dumping ok ... what does that mean in the context of this article exactly ? 
  i mean i know what `` price dumping '' is but i never heard of `` social dumping '' . 
   in matters of university , knowledge , refugees , fundamental values ah yes , those same refugees that a ) do n't want to stay here and go west the first chance they get and b ) the same refugees who are in camps in france and other places and our government [ does not want to have calais-style camps ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/284450,poland-will-not-build-closed-camps-for-refugees-presidential-aide ) in our country . 
  i am sorry but we did n't go into these various middle eastern countries and bomb the shit out of them , we did n't go `` wir schaffen das '' and invite them here , and yet we should take them because reasons ... 
  i would 've gotten away with it too if it was n't for you kids and your eu !, 
  that would make belgium into an actual country though ... 
  the [ philippines ] ( http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/worldbank/flag_philippines.png ) called and they told me you stole their fleg ... 
  you 're right , it was n't their board , just an [ editors ' meeting ] ( http://www.dailywire.com/news/5991/huffpo-releases-diverse-picture-editorial-staff-hank-berrien ), 
  [ according to this article ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/behind-the-bad-indian-coder/280636/ ) it could be the education system that 's at fault for the `` bad indian coder '' stereotype ... 
  yes , i know . 
  would be interesting to see the data such as whether more women decided to work in a given field after the institution of said program ( s ) . 
  yes , and it 's usually 9-11 % of women in construction , give or take a percentage point . 
  [ here 's one example ] ( https://www.ucatt.org.uk/women-construction ) . 
  direct link to ucatt 's 2014 newsletter which talks about women in various branches of construction ( pdf warning ) : https://www.ucatt.org.uk/files/publications/women%27s%20forum%20newsletter%20may%202014.pdf, 
  and has it had any measure of success in your opinion ? 
  i recommend watching [ `` the gender equality paradox '' ] ( https://vimeo.com/19707588 ) when it comes to these kind of things . 
  it took place in norway , a country considered to be one of the most `` equal '' countries in the world ... 
  it just needs a few balance patches ... 
  nursing is very heavily dominated by women and yet no one calls for more men to be nurses . 
   diverse range of views someone should tell that to the [ huffington post ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ls20sax.jpg ) :p, 
  based on the `` 40 % - female quota '' , i think ? 
  nowhere because those jobs are not as cushy now are they ? 
  ehhh so typical politics : mislabel everything and see what you can get away with , i guess . 
  sort of like how `` people 's democratic republics '' have nothing that resembles a democracy . 
  there 's also a problem with corruption afaik . 
  so why are they named something that they are n't ? 
  i am sure the people of that small town will be more than happy to have them . 
  great , so we should just be disarmed so that the state can slaughter us even easier if it ever goes apeshit . 
  with the help of our hussars lol, 
  it 's like salmon swimming upstream ... 
  it only takes one ... 
  this is starting to sound like western europe version of tesla and his pplace of birth ... 
  things like this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacification_of_wujek, 
  goddamn ukrainians taking our jerbs that we took from someone else / s, 
  did you eat the horalky wafers ? 
  those are actually pretty damn good , imho . 
  sooner or later the places they move to will start asking for more money then what are they going to do ? 
  only thing i can think of would be to go full automation at that point ... 
  were n't they supposed to be inside the pig ? 
  cheaper labor force . 
  ( no , goddamnit , no ! ), 
  it 's better to have your own firearm so that you know how it will operate at all times since you are always the last one to use and maintain it . 
  you mean make it so i could get a revolver ( i like some of our old school polish revolvers ok ? ), 
  without going through the 12 trials of hercules for a license ? 
  they 'd like to have me disarmed and wholly dependant on the state . 
  well . . we know what that leads to ... 
  i get out of the house daily and i avoid , or try to do so , situations where i might get robbed or killed . 
  i just realized a long time ago that you can not rely on the state to protect you at all . 
  because the [ town in question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kargowa ) is on the western side of poland :p, 
  i do n't run around like that either but i am not going to depend on the state either when shit hits the fan . 
   then how were dictatorships able to come in power before ? 
  they disarmed the populace first . 
   you do n't need to defend yourself , you live in a civilized country . 
  call the police . 
  you really think the police will actually do anything ? 
  please . 
  they wo n't suddenly appear to defend you while you 're getting shot by the local nutcase who happens to be armed . 
  why do you think i mentioned semi-automatic firearms in my previous post ? 
  i was hoping that * that * would be interpreted as `` the line '' , so to speak . 
  i am not advocating that people go out and buy rocket launchers en masse ... 
  and there 's also no justification that someone should decide what private citizens can and can not own when it comes to semi automatic firearms . 
  first we came for the jobs , now we are getting away with entire factories ... 
  you are n't the only one ... 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  thanks !, 
  so this means le pen is out ? 
  sort of out of the loop when it comes to the french elections . 
  with `` degenerate '' modern art to boot !, 
  hence the `` iirc '' because i was n't 100 % sure ... 
  exactly :p, 
  that 's true ... 
  the us army is n't a private corporation and soldiers are actually considered property of the us army iirc ... 
  [ just like how merkel got pissed off with the german flag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wcvfrw7.gif ), 
   he is rather handsome and i bet that 's what some people will base their vote on ... 
  not going to argue with a communist so there you go ... 
  [ i 'll just leave this here and bid you `` good day !, 
  some of those countries had russian forced on them , including poland during the commie times , hence the reason they really would like to learn something other than russian . 
  ayyyyy, 
   there 's literally nothing wrong with 90 % tax rate that 's literally theft at that point . 
  easier to just go right under 400k to avoid that ... 
  hon hon hon, 
  time to invest !, 
  magnets . 
  at this point it has to be magnets or something ... 
  yes , very much so . 
  that cover is like a red vs. blue video ... 
  i 've started wearing long johns ... in april ... wtf . . 
  we have vodka for those times when you get fucked in the ass by 3 or more sources at once ... 
  stop posting comments that have nothing to do with the comic ?
