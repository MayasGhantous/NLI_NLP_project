warszawa , poland - my original hometown , where much of my family comes from and where i spent almost half my life has first known traces of slavic settlement from around the late 800s , but a place called `` warszawa '' was not founded until around 1300 ( a fishing village at the time ) . 
  it got `` city rights '' in 1323 . 
  became polish capital in 1596 . 
  so , depending on how you look at it , it is between 1167 years or 717 years old . 
   certainly not one of poland 's oldest settlements ( for example , compare it to krak\u00f3w 's around 1117 years or gniezno 's over 1250 years ; in fact , gniezno has archaeological traces of human settlement since the late paleolithic - which gives it at least well over 11 000 years , but of course it was n't called gniezno back then and it was long before slavs settled the region ) . 
  but i still love it , i think warsaw in general is quite underappreciated . 
  exactly !, 
  and thanks again . 
  agreed . 
   and i say that meaning no to offence to him , as i used to be really depressed too and i remember that sometimes i 'd spout so much bullshit about myself and the world situation that it makes me laugh when i think about it now . 
  :p depression really changes the way you think and perceive the world . 
  hopefully he will get better too . 
  sadly , i no longer live in poland ( moved to do the uk several years ago ) . 
  i am from warsaw originally , but have also lived for a while in a village in eastern poland . 
  thanks anyway though , that 's really nice of you . 
  :d and yes , so glad to see someone from outside of poland appreciate the bar mleczny !, 
  i absolutely love those as well , but they are actually closing down many of them over there . 
  it 's all part of trying to pretend we 're more `` western '' and all that crap . 
  very joyful , i see . 
  i 'm not ignorant at all to what the situation is in various parts of eastern europe - it 's one of the reasons why my family had to migrate ( we used to be homeless back in the old country at one point ) . 
  and just because i live in the uk now does n't mean i live in luxury . 
  also , calling serbia a third world country in this context is misleading . 
  first world used to refer to western countries allied with the us during the cold war and against the ussr ( e.g. 
  all nato states at the time ) , second world meant soviet union ( with its satellite states and allies , so poland too ) , while third world was simply a term used to refer to neutrals ( including former yugoslavia , so serbia too ) . 
  the phrase only later gained such negative connotations of poverty . 
  anyway , i get that you 're depressed and i can somewhat relate to that as i used to be in a pretty bad state myself ( still on anti-depressants , but doing much better ) . 
  however , there is no point in projecting your negative experiences onto the entire serbian population . 
  everyone 's experiences are different . 
  haha , awesome , glad to hear you enjoyed it . 
   here 's a few more things i would recommend trying from polish cuisine ( without any cabbage ) : soups like [ \u017curek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sour_rye_soup ) or [ borscht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borscht ) ( we call it barszcz , but it 's quite similar to ukrainian red borscht ) . 
  [ kompot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kompot ) juice is also quite nice and reminds me of my granny haha you should also try some [ kvass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvass ) if you 've never had any , especially homemade . 
  it is actually more russian/ukrainian/latvian than polish , we 've had it in poland for so many centuries that it 's kind of become our thing too . 
  plus i absolutely love it !, 
  :p oh , and [ s\u0119kacz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0akotis ) spit cake - that one is delicious , it is polish-lithuanian . 
  hehe :p i actually got the ajvar from this polish shop that 's not far from where i live ( if that shop was n't there , i 'm not sure if i 'd be able to live here - brits are nice , but their food is terrible compared to many continental european countries ) . 
  i know you 're just goofing around , but that could actually be part of the reason . 
  i come from a northwest slavic country and so i absolutely love traditionally eastern european cuisine , but at the same time i have a weakness for turkish food . 
  serbia ( and many other countries in the balkans ) are obviously much more mediterranean in climate and culture - for me they are kind of like a cross between poland and turkey ( just as , i imagine , for the balkans we poles might be considered a cross between them and sweden ? ) . 
  basically , what i 'm trying to say is that serbia and some of its neighbours seem to get the best of both worlds in terms of cuisine . 
  ahh , i see . 
  thanks for the replies guys !, 
  and unfortunately i no longer live in poland ( for better or worse ) , it 's the uk for me atm , and flights to serbia from here are more expensive . 
  the nobility and monarchs of the [ polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) actually giving more proper political recognition to the country 's ruthenian and cossack populations . 
  then we could have had the [ polish -- lithuanian -- ruthenian commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian%e2%80%93ruthenian_commonwealth ) , and maybe poland would n't have been wiped off the map for over a century . 
  besides , imagine having a coat of arms as awesome as [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/coat_of_arms_of_the_january_uprising.svg ) . 
  or maybe germany ? 
  but if we 're really focusing on the friendly part , then more like czechia or slovakia , because we have so much in common . 
  ukraine used to be like that as well , but obviously things have changed around quite a bit over there . 
  oh , there are so many wonderful little towns like that all across europe ( i 've been to plenty in poland , france , england , a few in slovakia too ) . 
  but less than 50k population ? 
  hmm ... off the top of my head , i 'd have to say either [ carcassonne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carcassonne#/media/file:1_carcassonne_aerial_2016.jpg ) or [ albi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albi#/media/file:albi2007a.jpg ) , both in southern france . 
  true , but i 'd have to visit serbia to try any homemade stuff , which i 'd love to do someday but i ca n't afford to travel atm . 
  :( btw , rakija is similar to our \u015bliwowica ( slivovitsa ) , is n't it ? 
  a fruit brandy - often homemade - of around 60 % alcohol , but distilled from grapes instead of plums , right ? 
  it sucks tbh . 
  i ca n't go into detail atm , but basically here 's what i think : anything that brings the entirety of the human species closer together is technically a good thing and has the potential to reduce world conflicts ... it 's just a bloody shame that it always has to happen at the expense of smaller cultures and in favour of giants , such as the usa or china . 
  tl ; dr : globalisation could be a great thing if it was more fair towards all cultures of the world , but it never is . 
  being american ? 
  no , you should be fine in most parts of eu . 
  at worst , people may find you amusing - at best , they will be overly keen to help you find directions and all that . 
  being black ? 
  well ... pretty much anywhere in the eastern european parts of the eu you should be a bit careful . 
  we 're not all racists , but unfortunately many are quite xenophobic - especially with the current political climate . 
  previously , for most blacks visiting , the worst they would come across were maybe just some curious staring . 
  unless they were unlucky enough to meet football ultras . 
  nowadays though you never know , the far right is on the rise again and sadly many ordinary people are adopting similar views . 
  for the most part it should still be fine though , especially in larger cities with universities where the locals are used to seeing different ethnicities . 
  just be a bit more careful than you would be in london for example . 
  wherever you decide to go in the end , i hope you have a pleasant trip . 
  stay safe . 
  i see , thanks for your response . 
  i agree about carcassonne , it 's an amazing place . 
  really makes you wish more cities would put an effort into rebuilding their old fortifications . 
  i know it 's not very practical and quite costly , but it would look amazing and potentially bring tourists . 
  you 've even been to warsaw ? 
  that 's great - it 's actually my original hometown ( i also live in the uk atm ) . 
  what did you and your fianc\u00e9 think of warsaw ? 
  i 'd be genuinely interested in reading some of your impressions , as the city - at least from a tourist pov - is often underappreciated and overshadowed by krak\u00f3w , which is a much more popular destination . 
  pfft , poland has produced enough ridiculous music in the '90s to justify another german invasion . 
  [ see ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1l3czkvv78 ) ... [ for ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bekp8mg3a0 ) ... [ yourself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za1n8icgjwc ) . 
  at first 8/10 , but if they do n't already know any other slavic language then more like 3/10 , because i know they would give up soon . 
  i might get some flak from compatriots for saying this as a pole , but ... russia . 
  honestly . 
  yes , we share a troubled history to say the least , but at the same time we have plenty of slavonic heritage in common and i honestly feel that russians and poles could really get along quite nicely if it was n't for historical trauma and the need that many people on both sides feel to keep returning to that historical trauma . 
  plus i know some russian , enough to communicate every now and then , so there 's that . 
  it would be much more convenient for me than having to learn an entirely new language . 
  as an eastern european migrant who no longer lives in his home country , but has also visited a few places in europe ( unfortunately have n't yet had the chance to venture outside of europe ) , i can say that plenty of similarities and differences between various countries of the eu are often quite exaggerated by people depending on the context . 
  but that 's normal because everyone can only go off their personal experiences - myself included . 
  some observations i 've made : there is a clear difference between the cuisine of the uk and most of the continental europe . 
  then , again , there is a noticeable ( but not as clear ) difference between western european foods and eastern european cuisine . 
  for me personally , i feel a fair bit closer to other slavic nations due to the similarities in language , culture , cuisine , etc. 
  plus differences between orthodox and catholic countries are no big issue for me because i 'm not religious . 
  when i was in bratislava , it was actually easier to communicate with slovaks in polish than english because our languages have so much in common . 
   czechia is a similar case . 
  i also speak some russian , and once you acquire even a basic understanding of the cyrillic script then it 's easy to start picking up similarities between polish and belarusian/ukrainian , and of course russian as well but to a lesser extent ( i am much more fluent in russian though because i 've been using it more often ) . 
  i also have a weakness for serbians . 
  i ca n't really explain it . 
  their language is of course a bit similar to mine as well , but also quite different as it is southwest slavic and mine is northwest . 
  i do n't know why , i just like serbia even though it has plenty of the same issues as poland . 
  outside of the slavic family , i can say that i like hungarians , but this is much easier to explain .
