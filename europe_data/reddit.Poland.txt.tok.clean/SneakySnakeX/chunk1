who can replace saudi arabia ? 
  it 's a tough question 1 . 
  look at who 's governments hate the west and those that do n't . 
  especially the ones who chant `` death to america . 
  death to israel . '', 
  what countries get a huge portion of their annual military budget from washington ? 
  countries like egypt get $ 1.5 billion with a `` b '' a year . 
  what countries does the west get most of it 's oil from in the middle east ? 
  you immediately gain friendship when you turn a poor country into one of the richest in the world . 
  qatar for example , richest per capita on the planet , also a huge ally to the west but insignificant military . 
  saudi arabia has one of the richest militaries in the world . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the west only has a few solid allies in the middle east , each one being extremely vital militarily and economically speaking . 
  losing just one would be devastating . 
  they could easily switch sides to russia/china where they would n't judge . 
  there are * a lot * of articles on saudi arabia . . like this one from vice - [ who is britain 's most evil international ally ? ] ( http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/britains-evil-allies-849 ) . . 
  and no , it 's not the french but rather saudi arabia . 
  turkey is yet another one that 's turning to the dark side . 
  but guess what , we the west * have * to have evil allies that goes against everything we stand for . 
  without them , it 'd be economically devastating because russia and china sure do n't give a fuck how you treat your people . . and militarily , they do openly offer strategic bases . 
  you befriend the devil or you lose , simple as that . 
  i agree . 
  the west should start a massive migration to the middle east . 
  they 'd then follow us , then when we retreat back , we build a wall . 
  a giant beautiful wall with trump in golden letters . 
  it 'll be glorious !, 
  and we 'll make mexico pay for it !, 
  i 'm of glorious , very relevant poland . 
  danes are slightly irrelevant these days , especially with warfare . 
  chinese troops are n't going to attack , they ca n't . 
  that 'd go against the whole `` peaceful rise '' which means china does n't attack . 
  the only way would be through the un , as in their soldiers being part of the un forces . 
  also , russia has n't done shit yet but if you go to / r/worldnews , they already think he 's a great savior . 
  all he 's doing is securing 1 existing port that houses russia 's only aircraft carrier and adding an additional port they did n't have before . 
  not to mention 2 airbases . 
  i do n't know a single liberal / independent american that does n't believe in climate change . 
  i know very few poles that do n't believe it ... 
  i do know several brits that do n't believe it , they think it 's some international scam led by obama . 
  they also think rt is real news , not propaganda ... 
  this article is bs . 
  safe europe = strong nato, 
  and russia said poland was the cause for ww2 . . what 's your point ? 
  his point remains the same rather he 's german , french , or american . 
  it 's okay but if you do it again , mark my words - you 'll be finnished !, 
  this does n't bother me , of course they 'd say something like this . 
  poland paid the most for gas ( again ) out of any other eu country because russia is butthurt they cant control us nor can they invade ( again ) thanks to nato which i might add is growing , not shrinking . 
  i wonder why that is . 
  61.1 % for poland . 
  lies !, 
  poland super fit and sexy . 
  ehhh ... has the us tried to do what the un is ? 
  nsa mass surveillance , yes . 
  that 's wrong on many levels . 
  but what the un is trying to do would lay the bridgework for every government in the world to set it 's own internet rules , making china 's current extreme controls look more normal rather than an outcast . 
  there 's a lot of countries / leaders to `` vie for attention '' . . obama and putin are the very last ones you want on your radar , especially when the military is involved . 
  just saying . . you might get more than the bargained for . 
  icann / iana are controlled by the americans , perk of inventing the internet i suppose . 
  if the us keeps control , the internet stays free . 
  if the un gets ahold of it , the internet will never be truly free again . 
  let 's not forget , many countries including in europe believe that governments should control the internet to an extent . 
  this mentality is extremely dangerous . 
  i 'm strongly against racism ( like really ) but i can see why some are sickened by such a rapid growth of the muslim communities . 
  there 's not enough census to actually get an accurate picture yet , but in 3 years time i guarantee you the majority of all cities across europe will see a major spike . 
  that means a change in culture forever and a new european identity . 
  ** notable communities with high muslim population : ** * luton , uk - 24.6 % * haskovo , bulgaria - 20 % * stockholm , sweden - 20 % * slough , uk - 23.3 % * antwerp , belgium - 16.9 % * malmo , sweden - 20 % * note : these are estimates and do not necessarily reflect the past 12 months which could result in a significantly higher percentage .

   students get banned for saying slightly offensive jokes i went to two universities for the span of 5 years . 
  i never heard so many jokes about rape , racism , sexism , etc. 
  so i have no clue what you 're talking about `` saying slightly offensive jokes '' gets you banned . 
  banned as in removed from the school ? 
  no , they 'd lose the vast majority of their students . 
  staff , guest speakers , comedians , etc - those are the ones that are constantly talking about overly pc schools . 
  not students against students . 
  that 's what happens when you have two superpowers back to back that like to spread `` freedom '' and colonize the crap out of everything . 
  if you ever go to study in the us , they will not hand you your diploma without learning a 2nd language . 
  it 's mandatory . 
  why ? 
  globalization . 
  it makes you less competitive thus employers are less likely to hire you compared to someone who is fluent in a second language . 
  i would n't be too cocky about not knowing a second language . 
   in england that everyone speaks english so i do n't have to learn a new language . 
  so you do n't see a benefit in learning mandarin , spanish , french , etc ? 
  i thought british universities were on par with those in america . 
  i had to learn a second language . . it was mandatory to graduate . 
  also , learning a second language has helped me . 
  we do n't have a huge amount of spanish speakers here . 
  yes . 
  it 's called american-english . 
  globalization actually . 
  look at pre-internet age compared to now . 
  the british empire did spread it to parts of asia , but programming languages , hollywood , youtube , etc is what 's pushed it to making it manditory in most countries . 
  saudi arabia for example still has many non-english speakers but the vast majority of all kids in school can speak american-english now . 
  that fast , just a single generation . 
  same with cuba , vast majority cant speak english but not that it 's being required , most will . 
  you cant compete the same if you do n't know english . 
  england no doubt is responsible for it but the british empire quickly died off at the time when globalization started to really take route after ww2 . 
  hollywood has a huge part in it but also things like programming languages . 
  the * vast * majority of all programming languages in the world are in american-english which forces people in china for example to learn american over british . . then you have invasion forces in japan , south korea , etc. 
  also play a major role in not just language but culture like baseball . 
  this is what i do n't understand . 
  why do the vast majority of people pick american english over british english ?
