  india is yet another example of a giant population , yet about 5 laureates in it 's entire history . 
   my point was that it is n't biased in favor of usa , at least not strongly . 
  i agree with you , factually speaking per capita the us ranks 14/15th in most categories . 
  but seriously the # 1 spot goes to a country with 49,000 people , and there is only 2 large ( european standard ) countries , uk ( 9th ) and germany ( 13th ) . 
  you have to admit , the west * loves * saying how glorious we are . 
  lol, 
  yes ... there are many ways you can switch it to gain different results . 
  my only point was the nobel committee seems a tad bias , if you do n't believe that then i wont try to convince you otherwise . 
  but you should ask why a country of 1.3 billion only has 8 total in its entire history . 
  or brazil , population 200 million with just 1 . 
  i was n't going by regions , if you start talking regions then you 're obviously going to get something far different . 
  there are no `` fake '' categories . 
  not to mention most nobel prizes are * not * in the peace category . 
  there are many others with more recipients . 
  so even if you subtract every peace prize the us has won , but still kept them for other countries - they 'd still dwarf anyone for combined categories in physics , chemistry , economic sciences , literature , etc. 
  nope . 
  merely statistical facts to prove a point . 
  some people feel there is bias in the nobel prizes : ** usa ** - 353 ** russia ** - 28 ** poland stronk ** - 16 ** japan ** - 22 ** germany ** - 102 ** france ** - 67 ** china ** - 8 ** canada ** - 23 ** australia ** - 12 ** uk ** - 115 some would say there is extreme bias . 
  in likely a few years time the us will have more nobel prizes than all of those countries listed * combine * . 
  you can see why many people are skeptical about the prizes .

  putin needs one . 
  / s could you imagine if he got one ? 
  they literally sell t-shirts and framed covers of time magazine as if was a great trophy . 
  funny thing is when asked about their choice , time magazine said they select the most influential people for `` better or worse '' meaning adolf hitler could get on the cover . . which he actually did in the 1950 's . 
  give the nobel price to the ones who made the iranian nuclear deal happen . 
  by that , i mean the people who actually worked day and night for it . . the secretary of state / foreign ministers . 
  they deserve it , without them it seriously would n't have happened . 
  they seriously diverted iran from a nuclear bomb which would have been astronomically terrible and the us from a full scale invasion which would have devastated the us economy thus the european economy . 
  it 's one of the greatest diplomatic feats without any combat in world history . . but instead people are focusing in merkel ... she 's a good leader but ffs . 
  the driver cant even see out of it , clearly he got lost . . lets not turn this into a `` evil russian '' thing . . tanks get lost all the time , but mainly at the russian/ukrainian border . 
  no , more like a new world order ... again . 
  used to world orders rarely ever changed , now it seems to happen every few years . 
  the absolute main reason both russia and the us are agreeing on who to exclude is both want to move whatever negotiations along very quick . 
  russia agrees with the us on who should n't come . 
  russia * wants * to work with the us . 
  it 's just that both are agreeing they wo n't be in each others `` us-led or russian-led '' coalitions . 
  does n't mean they cant work together . 
  ** putin ** is appearing to want a similar agreement that defeated the nazi 's which i think will work , i think washington will agree with that too . 
  russian and us soldiers wont work together physically side-by-side , but will go after a common enemy with different end-game agendas . 
  # 1 is us and russian soldiers wont fight together . 
  god forbid that ever happen . 
  turkey along with several major western powers ( including us obviously ) has condemned russia 's actions in syria . 
  what i ca n't get is why france would be excluded . 
  france cant invite itself in , only the us can . 
  france hates assad , openly . 
  france has bombed isis in syria without assads permission as is likely going to do even more bombing runs in the near future . 
  turkey , as much as i hate to give their government credit . . they do play middle-man very well . 
  and russia does n't exactly mind them speaking out against them so long as the pipe plans ( fuel ) are n't disrupted . 
  it 's sad that already people are saying `` they pulled a volkswagen . '', 
  of course everyone knows that means they cheated / lied to consumers . 
  in defense of samsung , it 's an ongoing investigation and there 's nothing saying that intentionally did this . 
  then again with corporate greed , it would n't surprise me . 
  dear russians , in stronk poland , we posses of many homos . 
  they are our doctors , teachers , police , and even military . 
  we do n't fear them as you do . 
  we do n't kidnap them , and if that were to happen , they 'd be arrested . 
  we also do n't have a law that bans gay pride parades for 100 years like in moscow . 
  nor is it common place for gays to hide in the shadows . 
  so if you do come to poland , know there are gays literally everywhere !, 
  yours truly , a gay pole, 
  analyst from ard are correct then . 
  the russian economy as it currently stands is in terrible state . 
  the average chinese makes more than a russian , that 's insane . 
  a teen working at mcdonalds in the west makes more than the average russian . 
  and nobody ever brings up the aids crisis in russia , another thing that shows no signs of stopping , and another thing not talked about . 
  same shit the soviet union would do , ignore really massive problems . 
  bullshit = millions of people being displaced , the largest migration since ww2 , countless people dead rather through assad 's gassing or isis . 
  drone strikes that 've killed more civilians than terrorist . 
  selfish neighbors that wont help , and others that are supporting the terrorist . 
  a leader that makes known germany welcomes everyone then the flood gates open and that same country pleads for others to help . 
  this is n't merely bullshit . 
  everyone involved from north america , to europe , to the middle east are fucking up . 
  by not doing anything , you 're fucking up . 
  by drone strikes killing civilians , you 're fucking up . 
  by bombing assad 's opposition but not isis , you 're fucking up . 
  fortunately france is calling putin 's bullshit . 
  they have n't struck isis at all , instead they 're destroying assad 's opposition . 
  but i 'd bet my left nut that they wont speak `` blunt '' to his face like obama . 
  the key reason why assad may win is iran moreso than russia even . 
  they 're sending ground forces in , they 're also extremely brutal when it comes to enemies so a huge number of civilians will be killed but ultimately assad will have his country make and he 'll crush even the slightest opposition ... again . 
  you 're seriously quoting donald trump ? 
  you realize he 's famous not for his fortune because he 's much poorer than the majority of billionaires in the us , but rather his outlandish views . 
  same with bill o'reilly , not sure if it 's still the same but he had the most watched news show on fox news out of any other news show in the western hemisphere , taking into account globo , telemundo , etc. 
  daily mail in the uk is very similar , outlandish statements = more readers . 
  so why stop ? 
  you should n't take anything trump says serious , he 's a moron . 
  merkel is the one that said `` germany has room for 800,000 immigrants . '', 
  literally that same day , it made headlines across the entire middle east . 
  everyone was talking about it and still are . 
  then you have groups of germans applauding the migrants as they come off the train . 
  literally all they need is a red carpet . 
  and notice the massive spike that has occurred since merkel made that speech , not before but * after * . 
   germany is ** rich ** and could ** technically feed 10 million more . 
  ** if the us and china could n't do that , there 's no way in hell germany could . 
  germany would struggle with 1 million yet you say `` technically '' they could feed `` 10 million more . '', 
  do you have any sources to back that up ?

  he 's not alone with the batshit craziness . . 
  the telegraph - [ putin has embarrassed us all in syria .
