  even in poland , the vast majority not only wont spell `` color '' `` colour '' but will adopt the accent to spite english obviously being from england , not merica . 
  most countries now require students to learn english . . just not sure why most go for american english and not british english . . learning english fluently actually helped me get a scholarship . 
  it 's one reason why cuba now is having every school teach it . 
  plus who wants to watch game of thrones with subtitles ? 
  353 . . that 's insane . 
  i would have thought closer to uk or germany , not * that * big of a gap ... almost triple the next top countries . 
  i studied in the us , it 's much different than here . 
  you 're encouraged almost immediately to think different , conform to protocol but not to conform ideas , instead have your own - new ideas . 
  to become an entrepreneur and know you can succeed . 
  a free market that 's widely abused but also allows startups to flourish ( vast majority of all business in us are small businesses ) . 
  i ca n't pinpoint exactly what the states has that we do n't because we have all of that . 
  it 's just places like silicon valley and austin , texas where everywhere there innovates and crazy ideas are encouraged . 
  russia has an even worse brain drain , a lot of those russians are even leaving / have left for the states . 
  if not them then uk . 
  poland is seeing a huge rise in game development but other sectors remain the ( unflattering ) same . 
  this is the story for much of europe , one sector does well but others fall flat thus it 's not enough to stop a `` brain drain '' effect , even in france . 
  ^ ^ edit : grammar, 
  what does obama have to do with this , why single out the us when the entire west supports him including poland , germany , france , and the uk ? 
  last time i checked , turkey is also a vital member of nato . . so tell me again why obama would bomb turkey just because he 's turning into a dictator ? 
  realistically speaking , the west does n't turn ally into enemy because he may kill some of his people . 
  that 's not reality . 
  i think the article is to point out german hypocrascy of constantly appearing to promote only peace while at the same time they 're selling weapons in the billions that 'll obviously be used to kill people including civilians . 
  saudi arabia is also widely attributed to helping isis ( possibly on purpose ) and would rather the west use their bases to attack isis with ground troops then lift a finger , sending even one of their soldiers into the fight . 
  of course unless it 's from air . 
  and air to ground attacks are what has killed the vast majority of civilians . 
  suadi 's obviously are n't to blame for all , but many of the more indiscriminate ones do come from them . 
  then maybe they should evacuate to [ dildo island , canada !, 
  lesbos , greece ... not lesbos as in scissor sisters, 
  yet according to rt , oligarchs only exist in the west , not innocent russia that only wants to do good for all of humanity . 
  the guardian sold a book in it 's store for the longest time called mafia state . . very good read . 
  if you understand the mafia in italy or chicago ( 1950 's ) then you have a good idea of how russia 's entire government is ran . 
  it 's disturbing . 
  as is north korea . 
  democratic peoples republic of korea = dprk aka north korea, 
  putin is likely the worlds richest person . 
  his many new palaces alone are worth us$ 10 's of millions * each * . 
  in russia where everything cost far less than the west . 
  the fact is , he does n't even try to hide it . 
  if he did , he would have never built such huge , lavish palaces ontop of existing ones . 
  he 's a tsar , just with a different title . 
  remember , russia has only had 3 presidents in it 's history , he 's the one that made it possible for him to run again . . 10 years i might add . 
  one thing you 'll never hear russia media brag about are the vast palaces putin has built . 
  not just one , but many since taking office . 
  the buildings themselves cost millions , they 're huge palaces by european standards . 
  then you have to fill the palaces . 
  obviously whats inside cost more than the structure itself . 
  do the math on just that alone . 
  not to mention events such as the winter olympics . 
  says the one with a comment history that 's filled with * thousands * of anti-western , pro-russian comments . 
  you 're saying [ ap ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/stalin-billboards-crimea-ahead-victory-day-134701877.html ) is lying ? 
  totally agree , a man who murdered 45 million people * should * have billboards . 
  / s there 's a reason why germany and japan to spite both of them combine killing less than stalin . 
  you and / u/longes really are tag teaming these comments , huh ? 
  glorious putin must pay well or propaganda in russia really is * that * good . 
  sure but did you you know over 84 % still approve of putin , while the west has had a dramatic drop in approval rating from russian citizens thanks to a constant barage of propaganda . 
  mass media in russia mostly all consist of state ran propaganda funded by yours truly , the kremlin . 
   it sounds like the country is more concerned with appearing welcoming to refugees now you 're starting to get why most the world loves germany far more than other western powers . 
  it * seems * as if it does all the right things , it 's very good at pr . 
  vw , merkel essentially inviting 800,000 refugees , and the germans trading german citizen data for nsa software are just a few ( very major ) scandals from this year alone . 
  brilliant german thinking : act first , think later * : : cough cough volkswagen cough sneeze cough again cough fart cough to hide fart cough cough : : *,

  he also was responsible for the murders of 45 million people . 
  he killed far more than hitler . 
  have you heard of the massive rise of 10 cent trolls out of china and russia to push kremlin/beijing ideology on western websites like reddit ? 
  also , [ right before putin went to crimea they decide to put billboards of stalin all over ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/stalin-billboards-crimea-ahead-victory-day-134701877.html ) , portraying him as a hero . 
  russia has such an incredibly violent past . . not just other much weaker nations they invade but their own people . 
  then again 45 million dead is nothing to them still to this day . 
  jealous of extreme forms of propaganda , where the state runs the vast majority of all watched news in russia ? 
  that 's * nothing * to be jealous of , if anything i pity them . 
  this is polled off of 2,000 completely random people around the world . . some i 'm sure that could n't even name a single stock symbol . 
  but wikipedia does show that nyc and london are literally in a league of their own with globalization and only have each other to compete with which is impressive in itself . 
  i do n't think there 's a need for a cock contest between the two though , like these polls try to do . 
  here 's a proper link from [ wikipedia on globalization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_city ) statistics . 
  us and uk are in a league of their own , literally speaking and have very similar power from financial institutions to buying power . . so yeah they leap frog most years . 
  * fun fact : mayor of london was born in new york city . 
  this is based on 2,000 peoples opinions that are n't necessarily even in the business community meaning uneducated people who could n't even properly describe what the nasdaq is yet when these polls come out , uneducated people see them as factual statistics instead of some poll given to a small amount of individuals . 
  the british `` we are so glorious '' circlejerk is strong . 
   the online survey of more than 2,000 individuals this is completely based on individual opinion , not based on stastistics ie number of businesses , amount of headquarters , amount of financial flow , financial investment , etc. 
  just random peoples opinions , not even necessarily in the business community at all . 
   it 's really something i agree , there were a lot of extremely corrupt oligarchs there . 
   run along people who express their beliefs that are different from yours should leave ? 
  are you seriously * that * weak/threatened by non-religious people ? 
  i totally agree , we should follow islam and build more giant mosques instead of skyscrappers that house corporations that form our modern society . . / s, 
  largest mosque in the america 's finished it 's construction recently too . . 
  i believe it was mostly paid for by saudi arabia . 
  they 're putting the largest mosques in the countries that pose the biggest ( realistic ) military threats to islamist . 
  oligarchs / corruption galore, 
  keeping it classy ~ germany, 
  apparently john kerry pledging 100,000 just last week is n't enough . 
  or turkey that 'd held nearly 1.5 million already . 
  last time i checked , canadians saved europe from the germans too . 
  maybe another country should `` rule '' europe for a while . 
  one that starts with a p and ends with a d. 
  so americans prefer middle eastern food ? 
  in europe it 's mostly curry food from india . 
  i 've noticed germans have quited down a lot on the american refugee crisis . 
  reality is , * millions * - literally , millions without exaggeration are sending the vast majority of their money back to their home country , tax free . 
  that 's extremely damaging to any economy .
