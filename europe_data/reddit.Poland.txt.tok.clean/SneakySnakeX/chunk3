  it 's something eu states will not get to experience first hand . 
  there 's a word for all of this . . clusterfuck . 
  100,000 pledged last week by the americans is n't enough ? 
  are you serious ? 
  saudi arabia is a super rich country , one of the richest militaries in the world , they already have millions of dollars worth of refugee camp equipment . 
  they also asked the us to use military force against their neighbors but as some in washington have pointed out , they are willing for americans to spend billions , sacrifice marines lives while they do n't even lift a finger . 
  us trying to push them on * this * while they ca n't even convince them to properly attack isis would suggest that the us does n't have a lot of cards to play right now ... iraq war exhausted much of the west 's influence . 
  in fact , that 's a big reason why this crisis exist . 
   us turning a blind eye to your snooping for another 10 years again ? '', 
  germany handed over citizens data , there was no need for the snooping of citizens when they willingly exchanged it for spy software . 
  us pledged 100,000 last week by 2017 . . only 1 year and a few months away . 
  she set the quota of 800,000 . . she made it very clear europe is open to migrants . 
  so yeah , she did invite the whole world in . 
  even earlier in the year she encouraged americans / canadians to come to germany for a free higher education . 
  she 's literally doing everything one could * to * `` invite the whole world to come to germany . '', 
  germany still has a special bubble around it , people view germany different than any other country . 
  * take the vw scandal where they systemically built a system to cheat emissions tests , now millions of cars are effected . 
  * nsa scandal where germany willingly handed over it 's citizens data to the nsa in exchange for spy software . 
  but they acted self righteous as if they 'd never do such a thing . . only the evil us / uk could devise such a plan . 
  * germany 's open arms policy . 
  merkel pledged 800,000 , letting the entire middle east know that there 's room , you just have to make it to europe . 
  while at the same exact time merkel threatening eu states if they do n't meet a quota that did n't exist before . 
  fun fact : not everyone believes in the same values as germany nor are those who disagree always wrong . 
  this . 
  europeans are making up a large market for cocaine consumption that comes from latin america thus europe is increasingly funding the cartels likely in the billions annually . 
  but there are n't any pledges for 100,000 refugees or even 1,000 from germany yet the us is taking in 100,000 . 
  poland is also coming close to it 's `` demands '' from germany with the quota . 
  yet at the same time the german government is second guessing their open arms , open border policy . 
  not to mention the us just pledged 100,000 which is a massive number within just the next couple years alone . 
  100,000 is n't enough ? 
  is she joking ? 
  how many has germany taken from the much longer refugee crisis from latin america ? 
  last time i checked germany along with the rest of europe has an increasing demand for cocaine from those countries thus contributing to the crisis just like the us helped create the crisis in syria and iraq . 
  both countries helped cause this mess but germany is once again being extremely hypocritical . 
  just like the nsa scandal , acting completely appalled when the entire time germans actually willingly handed over their citizens data in exchange for nsa software . 
  merkel is n't all she 's cracked up to be . 
  anyone notice the url : news.err.ee yeah it 's fucking eerie when you 're talking about suicide all day long . 
   i can think of other groups that do not integrate at all but we wo n't go there . 
  are you referring to the akbar variety ? 
   seal eu borders why seals ? 
  why not tigers ... does n't make sense . 
  that 's not true . 
  epa according to german news is more strict than anything in europe . 
  us is the worlds # 2 omissions polluter but it 's constantly cutting back and american factories are extremely clean . 
  as / u/bloodysneeze pointed out , the us has the strictest laws against diesel emissions in the world , again making your statement far from reality . 
  it 's sad when i 'm not even american feeling the need to defend them due to open hatred stemmed from ignorance . 
  i disagree . 
  according to german news , the epa is more strict than anything ( similar ) in europe and they have a track record of making examples out of major corporations . 
  us senators have even attacked them for being too far reaching and too powerful ( republicans of course ) . 
  i think vw is in very serious trouble . 
  most countries do n't have the same strict emission standards that the epa enforce so it may be a none-issue for other countries ... at least vw better hope . 
  that 's an understatement . 
  if you listen to german news , the entire german car industry is at stake . 
  die welt already said it 's harmed `` made in germany . '', 
  likely a bit dramatic , but it does hurt the trust of german industry internationally . 
  but the most astounding thing is n't pride but rather the fact that they 've already lost billions today alone and even though the epa has no authority outside the us , it 's already caused shares to fall 23 % worldwide . 
  2nd largest car manufacturer in the world , it 's causing a worldwide panic for the industry . 
  oddly ( not really ) enough american auto industry is having a good day , same with british and japanese car manufacturers . 
  there 's a bright side , now us republicans and germans have something in common - they both hate the epa !, 
  it 's a reminder that we need to protect our parents just the same as they 've spent their entire lives protecting us . 
  never find yourself too busy to give your mom or dad a call , even if it 's just to say hi . 
  same with your brothers and sisters , death has a funny way of sneaking up on people . 
  i agree , but he 's made lots of defensive comments when the guardian is fallible just like any other news site . 
  why are you so extremely defensive of the guardian ? 
  the sooner you realize all media outlets have an agenda and are bias in one form or another , the sooner you 'll stop feeling the need to compare . 
  i used to be a the guardian reader , technically me reading this article would make me one . . but after the snowden issue died down , i started to read other articles for completely different subjects and noticed a clear , consistent bias . 
  they can push their views all they want but if other newspapers were to do the same exact thing , especially from the west then they 'd deserve to be called out as `` western propaganda '' to brainwash the capitalist zombies or some crazy shit . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the guardian is n't special , it has an agenda just like * every * other newspaper . . difference is , many readers think they 're `` awake '' while everyone else are sheeple . 
  first rule of the guardian : it 's never wrong , * you * are . 
   nor will germany 's angela merkel be able to duck the charge of contributing to the upsurge in numbers after laying out the welcome mat three weeks ago . 
  this will likely be the biggest mistake of merkels political career . 
  that 's major fuckery and guess what , people need someone to blame ... cant blame it on many issues caused by many countries which is the reality . 
  or the quickly growing trend worldwide of people trying to get into the west . 
  you should be proud of one thing , library of congress is the most beautiful library i 've ever seen , coming from europe . 
  it also holds more books than any other library in history . 
  in the tour they briefly talked about digitization of books . 
  majority of books have been donated , many by governments from china to egypt , some extremely rare . 
  just like the books were donated , they have donations to fund the mass scanning of books . 
  some in english others in languages no longer spoken . 
  * but * i do think the donations need to be diverted to the middle east . 
  some of the most important literate ever written comes from those countries and isis is n't afraid to burn them because somewhere in their sick minds , destroying ancient history somehow brings one closer to muhammad . 
  now you 're flagged by the nsa and will likely be at a cia blacksite within the hour . 
  when they offer you `` coke , '' decline !, 
  prior to this year how many serious french terrorist attacks have occured ? 
  people already forget about the train incident that was diverted . 
  if your country is n't part of the terrorist net , it will be soon . 
  they do n't want to leave anyone out . . even oslo had it 's own ( extreme ) form of terrorism when dozens were mowed down on that island . 
  and they do win to a degree regardless of what people say . 
  having radical new laws or you simply thinking twice about going somewhere is a win in itself for them . 
  modern basketball ( like baseball ) were created in the us . . it 'd be kinda like canada sucking at hockey . 
  so one would expect us to be the best . 
  they 're throwing out treason . 
  to give you an idea of how often russia convicts people of treason , last year alone 15 were convicted . 
  9 have been convicted of treason against the us in * all * of it 's history . 
  i do n't know how more real it needs to get for people to understand russia is really changing for the worse under the leadership of putin . 
  russia could be great , it does n't have to be this way . 
   some countries , such as the u.s. , have a high constitutional hurdle to conviction for treason , while many countries , especially absolute monarchies and dictatorships , have less stringent definitions . 
  * so how many people have been convicted of treason against the united states of america in all of it 's history ? 
  ** 9 ** * how many people have been convicted of treason against the russian federation last year alone ? 
  ** 15 ** not a * single * person charged with treason in russia this year or last has been found innocent , 100 % conviction rate .
