  well what about the conviction rate of americans charged ? 
  [ 30 have been charged in all of us history , 9 have been convicted .

  i do agree with you that there are beasts in russia that putin did not create . 
  at the same time he does n't lift a finger to stop it and he * does * go on national tv to either suggest or directly condemn homosexuals in one way or another . 
  he * is * responsible for many of russia 's most extreme , newly created laws against `` gay propaganda . '', 
  again , just because you did n't pull the trigger yourself does n't exclude you from responsibility , especially if you 're the f ` ing president of russia . 
  it 's not . 
  in this case , higher prices is a good thing . 
  cracovian almanac for the year 1474 is a single-sheet astronomical wall calendar for the year 1474 , and poland 's oldest known print . 
  this incunable , known also as the calendarium cracoviense ( cracovian calendar ) , was published at krak\u00f3w in 1473 by kasper straube , an itinerant bavarian printer who worked in krak\u00f3w between 1473 and 1476 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almanach_cracoviense_ad_annum_1474 poland relevant !, 
  successful means riot police were n't out in force or in some countries like russia , the police were n't corralling them to some remote area out of site to `` protect the children against gay propaganda . '', 
  then again putin put a 100 year ban on any gay pride parade in moscow . . fuckery of putin never ceases to amaze me . 
  meanwhile the us has it 's first openly gay secretary of the army . . with mike ~ ~ fuckabee ~ ~ huckabee stating that obama did so only to appease the homosexuals . 
  still plenty of homophobia everywhere , but congrats serbia !, 
  according to the article it 's because they feel as if they 'll be treated just the same as those that got lost / on vacation in ukraine . 
  a lot of soldiers fight for pride , benefits , sake of killing , and honor . 
  how can one be honored when your death is a mystery ? 
  they 're on / r/worldnews almost daily . 
  while that could be true , dont forget russia could very easily hack any of their accounts . . it 'd be childs play , not to mention any threats . 
  how russia deals with bodies of it 's soldiers is repulsive . 
  i can see how with current events and russia 's long past of treating soldiers less than sheep in battle that some would n't want to go . 
  no , they dont . 
  here 's one reason why : russia created krokodile which shocked the entire world , unlike any drug where it rots your flesh from the inside out . 
  google image search it on an empty stomach or youtube a vice documentary on it . 
  why did they create it ? 
  because russians are too poor for meth . 
  russians are also too poor for clean needles and the government / charities are readily handing them out as it 's seen as encouragement . 
  what happens when people use shared needles anywhere in the world , not just russia ? 
  hiv virus spreads like crazy . 
  aids is a huge epidemic that you never hear about in the news and it 's not being handled at all by putin but rather ignored . 
  if russia is willing to ignore such a giant crisis under it 's belt , why would the church or government give two shits about abortions ? 
  russia : meth epidemic  aids epidemic  abortion crisis  population crisis cases for aids in russia is one of the fastest growing in the world . 
  russian 's will be relieved to hear it 's not from homosexuality but rather shared needles . 
  some russians are very aggressive over the government providing free clean needles to slow the spread of aids down but others argue that contributes to the drug problem ... meanwhile many are getting sick or dead . 
  exactly . 
  but in some countries even rape victims cant get an abortion . 
  on the flip side you have countries like russia with a huge aids epidemic that ties into the huge meth epidemic which links to the huge number of abortions that is a partial cause of complete crawl of russia 's population . 
  pro-choice is what i believe in but at the same time a growing population is extremely important so those who semi-restrict it are n't exactly batshit crazy for doing so from an overall civilization aspect . 
  at least some of the countries known for racism that i wont mention are very open about it and do n't deny it 's existence . 
  i 'd much rather have that then sweeping major issues under the rug . 
  kinda like putin saying russia does n't have any problems with gays lol, 
  european rednecks ? 
  poland ... all the same of course a german would say that . . 
   we need an eu tax law . 
  and we need an eu tax authority . 
  funny , if they actually announced plans to form one , it 'd be on the fp of / r/worldnews daily of how awful it is . 
  you 'd have threats of cameron vowing to leave the eu then obama insisting eu stay unified , cameron agreeing , then rinse and repeat 6 months later . 
  if germany lead this , you 'd have people protesting , with pictures of merkel with a hitler stash . 
  i ultimately do not think it 'd work . 
  and i think comparing the eu which is made up of many sovereign nations to a singule federal nation is absurd . 
  why does society put men on the very bottom , why are men 's lives so unimportant ? 
  seriously . 
  i understand putting a child 's life above all else but when gender comes into the mix you 'll here `` 3 children , 6 women , 1 elder dead . . and 48349 useless men . '', 
  that 's like saying the crimea elections were totally legit to spite putin going on camera saying that the decision to take it was decided weeks in advance . 
  you should ask chinese about racism in st. pete . 
  especially if you go into some of russia 's smaller cities , it gets worse . 
  and lets not forget how they constantly refer to obama as a monkey . 
  is that a joke with germany ? 
  last time i checked the germans have no clue what they 're doing with immigration . . but do n't let me stop the `` germany is flawless '' circlejerk . 
  germany has best pr in the world . 
   why hungary is so awful to refugees because they 're also hungary ? 
  i know , right !, 
  i mean the pentagon literally said it if you read the article but can we trust that the pentagon is n't lying about talks or the kremlin !, 
  nearly 1.5 million citizens died when russia invaded afghanistan . 
  people forget , they truly dont give a fuck about collateral . 
  it did happen years ago , actually . 
  why do so many people just read the title and not the actual article ? 
  you would have known that . 
  something about `` talks for the first time in a year '' would hint that it was about a year ago since they 've had these talks . 
  i 've never heard sweden called land of freedom ... sounds very merican to me . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  try writing scripts or as i said , pivot tables in excel vs any of the alternatives . 
  i worked with libreoffice for nearly 2 years then we got ms office a couple months ago , everyone in the office acted like it was christmas because ease of use for complex tasks is so insanely easier . 
  i would n't consider that a `` glorified calculator . '', 
  half of this subreddit seems to be a german circlejerk . . used to not be this way . 
  and `` beautiful '' is very subjective . 
  most people outside of europe find french to be the most beautiful language . 
  it 's literally synonymous with romance . 
  merkel is n't good at strong opposition from many eu nations . 
  something tells me she thought germany would be on some glorious march of freedom for these immigrants then realized many eu nations were not backing her and even at home there was/is strong opposition . 
  sovereign countries should enact whatever humane measures they see fit to block out immigrants if that 's what * they * feel is the right thing to do , not merkel deciding for the entire union . 
  ^ ^ edit : typo, 
  of course she 's backtracking . . and that 's exactly what she did . 
  you should seriously go on twitter and facebook to look at what actual syrian refugees were tweeting . 
  the message they received was that germany would take in a substantial amount , the only limitation was you actually getting there but once you stepped foot on german soil , you 'd be safe . 
  she even set a number of 800,000 . 
  germany literally handed over metadata of their citizens for nsa 's top spy software so if a country that supposedly is against spying yet willingly trades it for some software then italy is no match even against other eu states much less america . 
   using any american software in military ( or in public administration ) is a big lol ... ** red hat linux ** - american , used by many governments and major european corporations ** cisco ** - american , # 1 routers/switches used in every eu member state . 
  ** android ** - american , most used os for government smart phones in eu . 
  even ** tor ** was created by the us government which is essentially what the dark web runs on . 
   it looks and works so similarly to osx now i own a macbook pro and am a daily linux user . . curious , have you ever spent a lot of time on a modern mac ? 
  installing packages are different , deleted a file is different , the file system is different , the keyboard shortcuts are different , by default theme with ubuntu it looks different . 
  and if you ever experienced mac , it feels a lot different . 
  if you theme it then yeah it can look very similar but the core of it could n't be more different . 
  if you go to university , most students use microsoft office . 
  if you ask the average mac user which they prefer , ms office is likely their # 1 choice . 
  but what happens when you 're a government that cant afford a usd $ 40 million contract or an individual that cant fork out $ 160 . . well you turn to open office or libreoffice . 
  i 'm a linux user and i do appreciate freeware ( that does n't contain malware ) but i have to give it to microsoft on this one . . office 16 is the shit . 
  example : try doing a pivot table in ms office compared to libreoffice for the first time ever .
