  he might retract that once he finds out his `` partner '' merica already has a south park song literally named blame canada https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bor38552mja, 
  i guess elton john really is queen of the gays . 
  ftfy, 
  ever wonder how world leaders are able to talk and walk without any translators around ? 
  english !, 
  and here 's the shocker . . putin did n't learn british english or australian english but rather american english . 
  he probably did that when him and bush were fishing buddies at camp david . 
  you do realize that whenever you have mass migration , rape is part of it - right ? 
  for example most women in latin america will be raped before reaching the us border . 
  that 's a statistical fact . 
  once they 're in the states ( illegally ) , they can be subject to rape as men housing them ( illegally ) know that if they call the cops they 'll be deported immediately unless a judge grants them asylum . 
  not is it because they 're latin ? 
  or maybe it 's just the two continent have something others dont ? 
  again , no . 
  it 's the weak and vulnerable being prayed upon . 
  when there are mass rallies in the middle east like for example in cairo , egypt - there were gang rapes all over the place , day and night . 
  one would think with so many people , it 'd be impossible but it was the exact opposite . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** rape is n't just a european thing , it happens absolutely every time their 's mass migration or even when a large crowd is in their home country without enough security . 
  i just realized this after posting that assad was born on 9/11 . 
  lol, 
  [ $ 100 million mega-mosque coming to this state ] ( http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/100-million-mega-mosque-coming-to-this-state/ )  is expected to `` become the largest and most striking example of islamic architecture in the western hemisphere '' by october 2014 that 's just one of many . 
  and they 're extremely expensive to compete with super rich baptist and mormon churches in the us . 
  still no helipads like the baptist , peasants . 
  fastest growing religion in the world ? 
  islam https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/growth_of_religion, 
  thanks , germany merkel has essentially told the middle east `` hey , come , we 'll except everyone ! '', 
  meanwhile in parliament germany is urging all eu member states to set quotas immediately and accept far more migrants . 
  if you 're the one telling everyone to come in then * you * should bare the responsibility . 
  or you can try to make europe less attractive and we 'll all handle the situation together . 
  but do n't be the hand that opens the flood gates then point fingers . 
  i would n't get excited lol . . small countries are far more vulnerable to economic espionage that can cut any advantage ... it 's not just spying on military secrets . 
  you 're talking about possibly billions of dollars in loss , sometimes entire lifetime 's worth of work stolen within a few seconds . 
  that 's not cool . . especially for countries like poland or lithuania where i 'm sure there 's already a shit ton of spies . 
  do n't forget , soviets stole a lot of us technology through spying , they were very good at it so tiny countries today do n't stand a chance . 
   yes i am labeling the entire country you 're the ignorant one . 
  so you 're just labeling an entire country . . that makes your argument a lot better !, 
  / s what you said :  what about israel . 
   if you think bbc , reuters and ** other media ** first off , it 's amazing that you know where i get my news . . and `` other media '' as in what , all forms of media ? 
  what would a highly informed person such as yourself suggest for an ignorant person like me ? 
  no , us is not to blame for all of this nor is any single country . 
  and yeah , of course , make sure you blame the jews . 
  / s  so isis is literally just a few thousand hooligans who want to take over the world ? 
  it 's that simple huh ? 
  i ca n't tell you how to think . 
  if you 're that simple minded and it makes you happy , then stick with that but in reality it 's far more complex . 
  considering the fact that russian submarines randomly show up , i cant see why this is a bad idea . 
  poland could always give washington a bj in return for some cash . . they give egypt over $ 1 billion annually for their military , same with israel . 
  how much is a sub ? 
  every country in this is to blame . 
  every citizen in every country involved needs to voice their opinion and not just sit on their hands . 
  oligarchy has returned to the west . . not sure if it ever really left . 
  germany has no room to complain . 
  they 're the ones bringing in everyone with open arms and letting everyone in the middle east thinking about leaving - knowing europe is open to all . 
  then you have radical far left party trying to put blame in the us already . . got ta blame someone . 
  ( left party comes from 2 older parties including a communist party ) . 
  the link you provided does not show a major influx in pakistan born citizens in 1989 either in oslo . 
  are you going to go up another decade again ? 
  let 's stick to the american version . 
  like it or not , germany is leading the eu . 
  that simple . 
  washington and moscow support merkel for the most part and obviously in the eu germany reigns as the powerhouse thus all the power is in merkels hands . 
  hopefully others will see why uk 's questioning of being a member in the eu is n't absurd . 
  every time i see a closeup of putin smiling , i 'm always reminded of all the cosmetic surgery he 's had done . 
  there are a lot of new `` silicon valley 's '' around the world ( china , saudi arabia , several spots in europe , even brazil ) . 
  reality is , even to get remotely close to what they have in california would mean getting some of the largest tech companies on the planet to move there , then to somehow magically persuade tons of very gifted geniuses to move there . . and if that was n't crazy enough , you 'd actually have to produce regular major innovations non-stop to become the `` new silicon valley . '', 
  i hope it works out but bollywood for example took 80 years to turn from a joke copycat to the worlds # 2 / # 3 top film industries . 
  high-tech industry is even more complex . 
  again , no sources directly showing 1970 . 
  i just wonder if in berlin , they really tried to get this deal in desperation or if it was moscow that was desperate . 
  either way more pipelines means russia will continue to have it 's # 1 export mostly untouched so really it 's a win for the kremlin . 
  we were dumb to have all our eggs in one basket to begin with . 
  seriously , what were they thinking ? 
  too bad it 's so heavily photoshoped . 
  so you have no sources . 
   the majority of pakistani immigration to norway ** happened in the 70 's ** sources ? 
  nope , it 's right here and still on the front page https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3jmwa6/russian_president_vladimir_putin_has_said_that/, 
  front page of / r/worldnews has that article , majority of the top comments agree with what i 'm saying . 
  are the thousands of redditors there wrong ? 
  it 's saying that these immigrants have a dream of the life they 'll have once they make it to europe . 
  if all of them were to go where they wanted , that dream would cease to exist because the shear amount of them would destroy the identity of europe as we know it both economically , socially , and politically . 
  oslo is an example of a smaller city , that used to be mostly white . . non-europeans were mostly american/canadian , that 's about it . 
  then came a surge in muslims from the middle east . 
  there 's a large section of oslo that 's dramatically changed over the past decade . 
  now image that absolutely everywhere in europe from big cities to small villages . 
  misleading title . . ffs  ** some ** of the richest countries in the middle east have closed their borders to syrian refugees ** front page of / r/worldnews ** [ ** jordan has a population of 6 million , but have taken in 1.5 million refugees ** . 
  all with little protest or mass global coverage . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3jmmmp/jordan_has_a_population_of_6_million_but_have/ ) as some have pointed out they get a lot of support/pressure from the us to do so but so does saudi arabia . 
  but it 's not like the title suggest , there are some doing more than their fair share . 
  as putin said , the us is responsible for all of this . 
  they are directly to blame from the wars and for creating multiple terrorist groups . 
  [ migrant crisis caused by ` blindly following u.s. orders ' ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/migrant-crisis-caused-by-blindly-following-u-s-orders-says-putin-332508?piano_t=1 ) our anger should be against north america , not the middle east . 
  ** when is europe going to wake up , when is enough enough ? 
  spy ships spying on other countries !?!?!, 
  absurd !, 
  there already is a very large international coalition . 
   the chinese are developing their own right now their engines are awful , they had black smoke coming out of them . 
  and they 're copying us design specifically and exactly . 
  j-31 actually , their latest and greatest . . [ completely original design !, 
  ] ( http://www.ecnmag.com/blog/2015/01/chinas-j-20-and-j-31-stealth-fighters-based-stolen-f-35-documents ) / s it looks like an exact copy if you did n't compare the two side-by-side . 
  even the chinese copied it , and you know they copy the best .
