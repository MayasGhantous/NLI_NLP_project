  bbc extreme russia shows that it 's * not * isolated to radical groups . 
  most are actually not considered radicals in russia albeit the radicals were the ones who started the trend . 
  exactly the same as their recent `` extreme '' documentary about police brutality in the us . 
  it explains it all in an eloquent , factual , complete form . 
   they told the truth . 
  just not all of it . 
  what did bbc leave out that 's so crucial , specifically speaking ? 
  can you give just one example ? 
  if you want to believe bbc lied or `` prepared '' as you say throughout that entire documentary series then go for it . . 
  i assume you 'd also accuse the new york times and the guardian of lying/bending the truth because they 've reported on it as well . 
   numbers and statistics in that material there 's actually a ton of statistics in the documentaries . 
  i 'm gay so obviously i 'm against homophobia in any form , it 's why i take this issue so serious . 
  and ukraine is n't a `` friend state , '' my government does n't dictate my personal views . 
  ukraine is still corrupt as fuck . 
  do you have any scientific proof that homosexuality = pedophilia ? 
  which would you like , documentaries from bbc such as extreme russia or hbo : vice documentary ? 
  there 's also literally thousands of articles about the kidnappings . 
  [ russia 's new neo-nazi sport : terrorizing gay youth online ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/7/4595246/russia-anti-gay-neo-nazis-bully-teens-on-social-media-occupy-pedofilyay )  last year , a teenager named `` alexei '' ( not his real name ) was aimlessly surfing the web from his home in moscow when he came across a curious ** collection of youtube videos ** . 
  each clip featured different people , but they all followed the same basic script : ** a middle-aged man enters the scene expecting to have sex with a teenage boy he met on a dating website . 
  instead , he 's greeted by a group of young russians who proceed to lecture , humiliate , and abuse him . 
  ** vice - [ young and gay in putin 's russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az_asl3ktjg )  gay propaganda law dictates that you are not to show any sort of affection that may be seen as `` gay '' where children may be . 
   no it does n't . 
  you clearly do n't know the law then at all . 
  that 's exactly what it does . 
  [ bbc - extreme russia ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05rbyhq ) so you 're telling me bbc is lying , that what they filmed was fabricated ? 
  if you 'd like to compare every country around the world to russia in regard to homophobia , we 'll be here for a while because i 'm not aware of any country in the world where at one point gays werent mistreated . 
  but my point was the current situation in russia that 's gone from bad to terrible for gays . 
   in 2012 and 2014 pride marches in kyiv were cancelled at the last moment after the police told the organizing committee that they could not ensure the safety of participants following threats . 
  this year there were again threats from the ** radical right-wing groups ** , svoboda and pravyi sektor . 
  they are radical groups threatening protesters in a country going through a civil war . 
  you 're seriously going to compare russia to ukraine ? 
  and i 'm not aware of ukraine enacting any `` gay propaganda '' laws either . 
  can you point out where the current ukrainian government has made such laws ? 
  fixed . 
  i meant pedos . 
  a lot of russians think gay equates to pedophilia . 
  you get a very different story if you see his actions . 
  lets take homosexuality , something that 's already played out : * when the winter olympics came to russia , putin stressed that russia welcomes everyone !, 
  just dont harm the children , because clearly all gays are pedos . 
  * youtube had trouble for a while when there was a surge of videos showing kidnapped gays ( mainly teenagers ) being humiliated on camera . 
  the goal was for everyone in their school to know they 're gay , especially their parents . 
  many have killed themselves over it . 
  * people who attack gays in russia are n't attacked . 
  there are several radical groups that dont even bother covering their faces because they know nothing will happen to them . 
  and when youtube kept taking their videos down , they simply switched to vk where they do n't care . 
  there 's only been one person i 'm aware of to ever be arrested , but he was wanted by interpol while in cuba but was never charged for the kidnappings . 
  * 100 year ban in moscow against gay pride parades , you cant even have a small rally . 
  * gay propaganda law dictates that you are not to show any sort of affection that may be seen as `` gay '' where children may be . 
  well in russia , this is essentially everywhere . 
  this also means no gay pride flag on a t-shirt to spite most russians not even knowing what it stands for . 
  it 's also * illegal * to tell children homosexuality is okay . 
  so long as it 's to `` protect the children '' or destroy terrorist aka anyone russia does n't like then putin 's actions will always be justified and almost entirely unopposed in russia . 
  ^ ^ edit : grammar, 
  john paul ii was already well revered while he was living , more so than pope francis even . 
  they seriously started naming roads after him once he was voted in . 
  i 'm sure argentina already has renamed some roads for the current pope because you got ta admit , he 's kinda dope , he brings a lot of people hope , keeping them from sliding down a slippery slope . 
  there 's a good reason for it . 
  when settlers were planning , they already knew of grids for urban planning . 
  and numbers were more efficiency than anything . 
  but i do agree , numbers are completely boring unless they signify some important date in history . 
  that 's exactly what they 're doing . 
  right now somewhere in europe is a train full of refugees or a public square that 's filled with migrants . 
  there 's nothing wrong with the title . 
  the whole pc movement is getting * really * old . 
  you realize that putin suggested assad step aside years ago , right ? 
  so even russia at one point thought assad should step down or be removed . 
  right because all of assad 's opponents are terrorist . 
  labeling people as terrorist these days equates to a green light to destroy them . 
  in reality the vast majority of people russia has bombed are assad 's opponents , the same people he gassed that resulted in over 400 childrens deaths . 
  but yeah , let 's rationalize that merely because saudi arabia happens to agree with it 's allies . 
  saudi arabia is shit , but that does n't negate what france , us , germany , uk , etc have accused russia of doing . 
   political influence can you explain please because that does n't make any sense to me why russia would spend billions buying from a nato member to get an incredibly advanced ship , one that russia does n't even have in it 's navy just for `` political influence . '', 
  i do n't think they cancelled due to ukraine . 
  when it comes to military sales , countries are always willing to turn a blind eye . . they actually made an argument that the sale was made long before the annexation of crimea . 
  other western countries heavily convinced them it 'd be very bad if russia got their hands on that ship . 
  and france is going to be able to sell it , it 's just that they lost money in the process and nobody else is footing the bill . 
  let 's look at this from a non-pc , realistic view . 
  we all respect russia 's capability of producing deadly weapons rather it be advanced fighter jets , missile systems , tanks , or hand guns . 
  one weakness of russia is their navy . . this is n't anything new . 
  obviously with the soviet union , their naval innovation was n't even comparable to what it is today , they were producing state-of-the-art ships on a routine bases . 
  now they 're stuck with a lot of soviet relics , including their one and only aircraft carrier . 
  russia needs these ships . 
  russia cant just draw up plans over night , development is massively expensive and tanks years if not decades of development . 
  by giving russia this ship , it would be a step in modernizing it 's dated fleet . 
  also , one could argue it could reverse engineer it to make duplicates . 
  the cold war was n't that long ago . 
  so there was a chance that russia and the west could revert back . 
  everyone should hope for the best , expect the worse . 
  that including major military transactions . . 
  i mean , of all things . 
  i do n't think france was stupid for agreeing to the sale originally but at the same time , i do n't blame eu members for threatening france to block the deal . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** france was n't stupid for making the deal to begin with nor are the eu countries that ` threatened ' france if they did n't stop the transaction . 
  for russia to research , develop , and actually build a ship like this , it 'd cost 10 's of billions of euros , at least a decade , and even then france would have likely already advanced forward . 
  it 's why russia just wanted to buy them . 
  russia and france got screwed , everyone else got their way scot-free . 
  ^ ^ edit : typo, 
   it can be biased against world outside of usa and western european countries . 
  the thing is , they are n't kinda bias , or just slightly bias towards non-western countries . . they 're very bias . 
  if it were just on science , medicine . . okay yeah the west has done a huge chunk of innovation in the past 100 years . 
  but what about literature , peace , math , economics ?
