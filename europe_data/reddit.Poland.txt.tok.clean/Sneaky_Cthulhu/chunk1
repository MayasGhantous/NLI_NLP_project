` from proto-basque ' - what a pretty way to say that they just made it up . 
  basically , after a few centuries our zoologists decided to change the name ' \u015bwinka morska ' ( ` sea piggy ' ) to ` kawia domowa ' derived form latin . 
  the silly name comes from a bad translation form spanish to english ( thanks britons ) . 
  after all it 's neither sea , nor piggy , huh ? 
  sellers and breeders are quite nervous about this change . 
  i wonder if people will switch to this new name . 
  ` r ' creates a syllable here . 
  it 's like ` cztwyrtek ', 
  greetings from the country of ` solidarity ' . 
  [ awwww yeaaaah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rddmy_as3t8 ), 
  and only [ 20 % ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/42/273/artykul/1110903,raport-wynajem-mieszkan-w-polsce-i-w-europie ) of people in poland lives in a rented apartment . 
  getting a credit for a decent flat is even harder . 
  in poland it 's present mostly among uneducated rednecks , they believe that jews control banks , buy souls , eat christian children etc. 
  actually 99,9 % of them have never seen a single jew and just pass this hate from generation to generation . 
  the nice thing is that recently we have a small jewish revival and people are getting more aware and open in this matter . 
  british conservatives are still less conservative than polish liberals . 
  actually very ` european ' rostowski voted against it , and very ` progressive ' sikorski abstained , kopacz wants to shift whole matter to the next term . 
  and 8 years ago they were supposed to be liberal and pro-democratic . 
  ugh i 'm pissed off . 
  this blue mordor in lower silesia is probably legnica area , not wroc\u0142aw , but it 's still creepy . 
    is poland even a topic in china ? 
  i mean , how do you get the comunicate that we hate you ? 
  here our realation with china ( other than trade ) feels tiny , without much prejudice or emotions . 
  by ideologies i meant different concepts of fight for independence , we learn about them on polish lessons for almost one year in high school . 
  like 70 % of literature from late 18th to early 20th century is dominated by this topic . 
  i 'm surprised by [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/kosy1863.jpg ) picture from the 1863 uprising , i 've had exectly the same one in my history book . 
  do you also have to learn about all this 19th century resistance and ideologies ? 
  it 's funny how poles cry about victim culture in western eu , while our own culture is stongly based on martyrology and victim mentality . 
  in my theory , unsuccesful individuals and social groups in poland are frustrated seeing how well contemporary we treats people of other nationality or faith , as opposed to oppression we 've been through ( or still are ) for centuries . 
  you can always see this schadenfreunde mood when easter europeans moan about western europe destructing itself . 
  the problem is that polish conservatists do n't officially treat religion as the basis of their claims , eg . 
  by quoting bible , theologians etc. 
  they bring up the ` natural law ' ( homosexuals ca n't make children so they should n't be treated like normal couples ) or some scientific studies that simply fit in their theses . 
  in case of abortion they just extend the human dignity and right to life ( enlightenment-like ideas , you see ) on embryos and fetuses . 
  vast majority of people there do n't think that religious agenda should be directly implemented into our law , it 's just a part of a broad political/social/cultural front , church simply turns any discussion to a cultural war , which makes normal debate really difficult . 
  lol , the first thing that came to my mind was church . 
  oh my , ogniem i mieczem can be difficult even for some natives . 
  have you tried modern polish poetry ? 
  it 's quite minimalistic and based on a simple language , yet very touching . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uny4cspx4d8 ), 
  street art ( especially big murals ) and graffiti/tags are two different things done by completely different people . 
  tags are just a human version of urine marking . 
  why has hochdeutsch won over the other dialects ? 
  i thought that protestant/prussian north was the centre of integration ` radiating ' outwards . 
  i do n't get why the hate for vietnamese . 
  they integrate super quickly and are probably the most succesful of all ` poor ' immigrants . 
  more countries [ here . 
  ] ( https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/average-minutes-per-day-men-spend-on-unpaid-housework_chartbuilder.png?w=1024&amp;h=1326 ) distribution of european countries looks pretty random imho . 
  mussolini architercture is really intriguing ( [ especially this one ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1f/1f/87/1f1f871c8f4d89a7b7290f2d313fd581.jpg ) ) , it looks like an ancient roman 's dream - the shapes are familliar but much simplier and repeating infinetely . 
  [ in case of problems with this space we always have a plan b. 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_space ), 
  it 's neither about religiosity itself nor killing people , again , i do n't want to equalize muslim and catholic fanatics . 
  i 'm writing about the very idea of pushing the religious rules into the public sphere and the nation-wide legislation . 
  one can devote completely to his religion as long as he does n't force others to do the same . 
  law has to be based on the common ground of all citizens , that is science and secular ethics , not some unverifiable revelations and ancient books . 
  of course i see a huge difference in methods . 
  the term ` jihadist ' , was a kind of hyperbole of their blind , hateful zeal . 
  i did n't mean it 100 % seriously . 
  it 's the same destructive idea . 
  the difference lies only in circumstances and quantity . 
  you ca n't say that neo-nazis today are ok just because they used to be more dangerous 80 years ago . 
  i compare fanatic catholics trying to force their religious beliefs on others to fanatic muslims trying to force their religious beliefs on others . 
  and i add catho - to make it clear . 
  a bunch of ` opressed ' senior-cathojihadists conducted exorcisms before the behemoth 's concert in pozna\u0144 . 
  quite extreme representation of our centuries-old clash of secular and theocratic tendentions . 
  weird . 
  to me ` babie lato ' is the default polish name for ` indian summer ' . 
  do you have some other expression where you live ? 
  i feel like calling the blue banana a megalopolis is a bit far-fetched . 
  these cities had developed independently during different periods and for different reasons . 
  the bb is about three times ` longer ' than the northeast and divided by water , mountains and languages . 
  it may be dehumanizing , but then what is a human ? 
  a fetus up to 20th week doesnt ' t feel pain . 
  it does n't have any thoughts , emotions or experiences . 
  some fertilized eggs turn into tumors , are they jus as human as the women who carry them ? 
  the dna is not the most important thing , we should fight poverty , physical and mental suffering ; it does n't make a difference to those cells , but means everything to people who are forced to have kids when they ca n't . 
  looking at the scandinavian protestants , adaptation of a religion to the modern world is pretty much an honour suicide . 
  secular humanism by definiton ca n't get on with dogmas and supernatural authority , which are the bases of every religion . 
  but ' i believe ' implies ' i do n't know ' . 
  as freakasso said : a + gnosis means ` without knowledge ' . 
  you ca n't ` know ' about gods or ` some sort of spirit ' just like you know biology or astronomy , that 's why we ask people about their faith . 
  you can answer ' i do n't know for sure whether the god exists but i do ( or not ) believe in it . ', 
  the yellow option shuld then be ' i prefer not to answer ' . 
  it 's silly . 
  tbh 100 % of people should be in the yellow bar . 
  they ask about faith and offer an answer about knowledge . 
  poland has a teen acne . 
  tentacle of friendship, 
  pis are indeed keen to help the ` weakest ' , but they do it in a really populist manner . 
  normally the welfare state is based on social responsibility and solidarity ( ` broadest shoulders should carry the greatest burden ' ) , people agree to raise taxes for the richest and move this money down . 
  pis make it more of a culture war - family values are the reason for child benefits , economic sovereignty means subsidizing coal etc. 
  this model is too detached from reality to be as sustainable as the typical western european welfare state . 
  i know that this camp is incomparable to e.g. 
  the holocaust camps , but nevertheless this case feels really understudied and almost completely unknown to the public . 
  i 've read first about it in janusz rudnicki 's `` chod\u017acie idziemy '' . 
  he made his own investigation and it seems like the number of deaths caused by the authorites of the camp was much higher . 
  it was an act of atrocious revenge directed at innocent german civilians - women , kids , and elderly . 
  but there was a [ polish death camp ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ob%c3%b3z_pracy_w_%c5%81ambinowicach ) . 
  3 % for us is actually less than expected by economists and the government . 
  his coma was caused by a brain damage so it probably ca n't just suddenly go away .
