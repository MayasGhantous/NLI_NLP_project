  maybe brain can gradually regenerate , but it 'll be more like a long rehabilitation . 
  build a frickin ' enormous wall, 
  do you understand ` soft and weak ' as higher standard of living , more personal freedom , longer life and better perspectives of self-development ? 
  i ca n't believe that someone from poland would say that war has a positive effect on society . 
  oh boy , i thought that calvinism was one of the nicest denominations . 
  still it 's probably better to have 2 % of ultra-freaks in a normal society than 40 % of dull devouts . 
  something midway from ur to uruk . 
  sounds really ancient and mesopotamian . 
  [ can it get more latin than poland doe ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/hegmulqrjha?t=30s ), 
  are you serious ? 
  carbon dioxide , along with cholesterol and wife-beating were the main values of the warsaw uprising . 
  but now turkey is crucial for bad stuff going on in the eu , middle east , and perhaps also russia on the black sea . 
  some serious history going on, 
  dem slippers doe !, 
  i would n't be able to spend $ 200 on something just to pour it into my mouth and pee it out a few hours later . 
  here comes the propur la 'n pronunciashon , yuropoors . 
  it 's a good idea and should be an eu-wide law . 
  after all , the alcohol has far worse effect on society than e.g. 
  soft drugs , which are so precisely restricted . 
  this asymmetry is clearly irrational and harmful . 
  but tradition and big money seem to be more important lol . 
  many layers of quite random but comfortable clothes + plain 4f jackets ( it 's like polish jack wolfskin ) ; loaded with bags , backpacks , swinging cameras ; arguing ; confused , anxious faces ; and of course polglish accent ( especially flat , short vowels ) . 
  not that i 'm much different ... oh , and clapping after touchdown in airplanes . 
  i thought it 's just a stereotype , but i was happy like a little kid when it happened at my first flight . 
  but those mediaeval p\u0105czki with meat sound amazing !, 
  i 'd love to try one . 
  i might be biased , but i feel like poles today are n't as hawkish as you 'd think based on our history . 
  i hear regularily that we 'd be better off now if we were ` softer ' ( like e.g. 
  czechs ) during the ww2 . 
  we are kind of tired of fighting , dying and ruining the country . 
  all of these eurostat 's maps have shitty data representation . 
  i think they 're made automatically . 
  i also love how they always place a big liechtenstein just to show that there 's no data for it . 
  there is a real difference between english/german / h / as in ` hand ' and our h/ch as in ` hojny ' . 
  the difference is subtle , but we prononuce our ` h 's ( [ / x / sound ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_velar_fricative ) ) with the back of our tongue , while the ` normal h ' ( [ / h / ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_glottal_fricative ) ) comes from deeper parts of the larynx . 
  note that some people in poland make a little grunt like in german ` k ** r ** ank ' ( which is like the / x / sound with more fraction ) when they say ` chleb ' , english ` h ' is always smooth . 
  such a skyrim-ish name . 
  from future . 
  perhaps gda\u0144sk has some restrained burgher atmosphere , but it 's still one of the most liberal cities in poland . 
  if you 've had a cultural shock here , you 'd better not go to the south-east . 
   gda\u0144sk citizens  decidedly right-leaning u wot, 
  i do n't agree . 
  even though this progress in education is not as positive as in asian tigers , it 's still quite good . 
  we have a problem with too many people living and working in small agriculture and low-class services in small towns ( hairdresser and bad pizza on every street ) . 
  higher education often makes those people move out , try a bit different life . 
  either when they go back home or move to big cities they contribute more to the society than poor farmers . 
  yeah , knowledge and skills do n't equal intelligence , hereby i order my secretary to call bullshit . 
  times were so boring that we had to make some frightening news up . 
  you even made me watch the google 's summary of [ 2012 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy_mub8adeq ) and [ 2016 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiviy7l_lo8 ) . 
  those videos are sweet and all anyway , but you can definitely smell the zeitgeist . 
  as a nasty kid i used to say `` trzy bobry '' and everyone answered normally . 
  suburbanisation !, 
  yay !, 
  dayum , we went from 18th to 54th place in just two years . 
  i must say we have a really hard-working government . 
  the aristocrats on those paintings were an ` inbreed spawn soon to die out ' , and it 's true . 
  it 's the old motif of poor ( or ` underprivilleged ' ) but alive vs rich and powerful but dead . 
  i do n't see anything controversial here tbh . 
  here it 's mostly 50 + people , sometimes i think this may be a remnant of their naturist/hippie youth times . 
  well , good ** for ** ** them ** . 
  i 'm not a fan of those flares . 
  they make it look like a football brawl . 
  in pozna\u0144 each demo is bigger than the one before beacuse it 's just a nice experience . 
  politicans are n't allowed to speak ( they 're asked to take notes lol ) , only lawyers/judges and regular citizens can go on stage . 
  and by ` regular ' i mean e.g. 
  a 15 y/o girl , football fan or a retired polish teacher . 
  you can hear many points of view as well as poetry and even some sort of stand-up . 
  almost entire high court was replaced in 1990 ( except of some judges specialised in civil law who are now dead or retired anyway ) . 
  the ` decomunisation ' argument is just a fig leaf , i can as well say that we need to burn down the wawel castle because i saw the chupacabra there . 
  if pis has a real reason to cry about those communists hidden everywhere , they are free to lustrate and prosecute them ; replacing judges who are 40 years old makes no sense . 
  i 'm still waiting for someone to cry about the inversed flag . 
   plenty of countries in europe select their high court judges through  parliament or goverment . 
  its not undemocratic or unconstitutional . 
  lol nope . 
  the raison d'\u00eatre of courts , especially the high court is to counterweight the legislative and executive branches of the government . 
  they can not be connected with any party or the government , because then there 'll be nobody to protect you from e.g. 
  unjust tax or a personal revenge from a politician . 
  the european charter on the statute for judges says that candidates for judges should be nominated by a council of judges chosen by judges . 
  in the rest of europe minister/king/parliament just appoints a judge , but they ca n't choose anyone , like pis would like to . 
  ( appointment of judges is always undemocratic btw ), 
  yep , the 18-24 result looks like a total bs . 
  i 'm in that group and support for po + . n ca n't be lower than , say , acceptance of gay marriage or percentage of vegetarians . 
  i 'm making this comparison to be sure that i 'm not in some extreme bubble ( nota bene in which supporting pis is something to be almost ashamed of ) . 
  the problem is that there are too many poles who are pro-west to leave the eu and , at the same time , quite a lot of those who are still in the xix/xx century 's siege mentality . 
  but the long term dynamic seems to be westward and the current government is ( hopefully ) just an episodic reaction , which is already causing a pretty big backlash . 
  i think that we 'll be able to talk about poland 's mid - and long-term ideological orientation after our upcoming election serie ( 2018,2019 and 2020 ) . 
  pis seems to be a good way to ultimately compromise that foolish neo-sarmatism and give the pro-eu side a kick in the butt . 
  i feel like polend looks neatier than polxit . 
  i 'm glad that op wrote where is this ` paris ' . 
  i thought it 's las vegas at first . 
  nah , it should be named `` humungous '' . 
  this thing would collapse in a week lol . 
  a belt of independent , stable countries between poland and russia is in our vital interest . 
  thank germany . 
  he 's interesting but he also sells really r/badanthropology . 
  if you take democracy as a moral imperative then it 's always preferable . 
  but when country/society ca n't work properly , an ` enlightened autocracy ' can get things done more efficently . 
  democracy requires some basic level of order to work , and to achieve that ( e.g. 
  by gaining independence ) a strong , stable leadership may be needed .
