is n't that basically what 's been known for months ? 
  if they did n't care then , why would they now ? 
  really ? 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_for_germany ) says it 's 24 % , 15 % and 12,5 % in the last 3 regional elections . 
  nowhere does it says 40 % . 
  and [ recent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_german_federal_election ) polls place them at 12 %, 
   mr foster accused mr corbyn of having `` ignored the issue '' of anti-semitism , adding : `` i think i 'm right in saying i do n't think there is a jew in britain who has given money centrally to the party since jeremy corbyn 's selection because prior to his selection and since his selection we have asked and asked for this to be dealt with . '', 
  his dedication to battling antisemitism is truly something to admire . 
  i would n't call radical right getting ~ 15 % in certain regions of the country `` rise of the right '' . 
  it 's a rather regular occurrence in times of strife , that disappears as soon as the situation stabilizes . 
  i think it would be wiser to talk about polish pis or hungarian fidesz if we want to discuss potential right-wing environmental politics . 
  i do n't know , european right is n't that anti-regulatory like the us republicans . 
  i do n't think the polish right even has any official stand on environmental regulations . 
  exceptions exists , but the process repeats itself . 
  the intensity can vary . 
  it happens every time the goverment changes . 
  it 's called `` depoliticizing '' , and every party either believes or consistently lies that `` oh yes , those previous incompetent guys were elected due to their political connections , but our new independent expert will most certainly ensure that national institutions will run at 120 % ! '', 
  it 's always the same narrative . 
  in theory going case to case one could determine which employees are genuine expert with no political loyalty to the previous regime , but it would take too much time , so only extraordinary individuals are kept , end even then only sometimes . 
  it 's deplorable , but the only way to break the cycle would be for one party to perform genuine `` depoliticizing '' , and then have their successors recognize it , and uphold it . 
  and they 're taking a massive risk , because any potential obstruction that results from leaving political saboteurs will result in dissent , that will not hit the previous party , but the ruling one . 
  not to mention , you have people in your party who sacrificed 4 years of their life to help you win the election , and they want into those sweet , sweet government positions . 
  you deny them , and you got yourself a mutiny on board . 
  so high risk , low reward , and nobody really bats an eye on the practice anymore . 
  eh , traditional pis electorate perceives the constitutional court as the enemy , so they could n't give a hoot if what they 're doing is breaking the constitution . 
  the rest of the electorate does n't give a hoot about the constitution either , they just want the social reforms that were promised . 
  and honestly , in my opinion most of the protesters do n't care that much about the constitution either . 
  nobody was protesting when po simply stole money from the retirement funds . 
  the constitutional court issue merely provides a good excuse to protest , they fact they 're in the right on this one is mere coincidance . 
  man this comment section is a shitstorm . 
  last elections allowed the rather conservative law & justice to take the majority in the parliament ( no coalition required - thanks to a good election score and some luck ) , and the got their own president some time earlier . 
  so they want to press with their long awaited reforms ( wo n't go too much into it ) , buuuuuuut , the majority of the constitutional court was elected by the previous coalition . 
  judges are elected for 9 years , the last government ruled for 8 - so the managed to elect nearly the entire court . 
  as you can imagine , some people are accusing those judges would n't uphold the constitution , but the previous party interests . 
  it might be true , since the last ruling party tried to bend/break the rules , and elected two judges who should 've been chosen after the elections - obviously since it was projected they would lose them . 
  so law & justice decided there is a significant risk the constitutional court would be inclined to judge against it reforms , deciding they are n't constitutional . 
  so they decided to paralyze it , first by not signing in the judges that were rightfully elected earlier - ( last parliament elected 3 rightfully , and 2 by bending/breaking the rules ) . 
  then they started passing legislation - first electing 5 new judges , then changing the procedures by which the constitutional court operated , severely limiting its flexibility , bordering on blocking its work . 
  the previous ruling political party decided this will not stand , and called upon it 's significant ally base in the eu to put pressure on poland . 
  whether or not they were justified in doing so is up to you . 
  granted , they started this mess by electing the bonus 2 judges , but law & justice merely used this as an excuse to tamper in the court . 
  now now , the abortion issue is a work in progress , and unlikely to pass . 
  taking over the state media is , regrettably , the norm here , so we ca n't really call them out on that . 
  but pacifying the constitutional court is indeed a massive problem . 
  f * cking . 
  point . 
  conservative socialists , which in europe more or less counts as right . 
  conservative neoliberalism is more of a american thing . 
  then again , trying to group the entire range of political beliefs into a simple left-right system is silly anyway . 
  god damn it stop being reasonable trump we 're supposed to hate you . 
  russia between poland and germany ? 
  ha ha , now they 'll know how it feels !, 
  oh that also happened is poland as well , perhaps since the president has the power to veto the bill , so merely waiting to sign it is hardly wrong . 
  but when it comes to signing the nominations for tribunal judges , his signature was always a formality - the parliment elects them , he just makes it formal . 
  so refusing to sign them in would be as if the president read the law just passed by the parliament , and then decided it 's unconstitutional and refused to sign it , even though he has no veto rights . 
  then once the tribunal decides the law is ( mostly ) constitutional , he decides the tribunals ruling is unconstitutional , and refuses to sign it anyway . 
  which is kind of insane now that i think about it , but that 's more or less what happened . 
  last government ( po-psl ) messed up by trying to install those additional nominees - in that part , pis was entirely justified in trying to revert that and reelect new ones . 
  however , it quickly became a convenient excuse to mess around with the constitutional tribunal , and i 'm fairly sure someone at the top decided `` you know what , there 's no f * cking the media will ever see it our way , let 's just go all the way and get the full 5 judges for ourselves . '', 
  ( they can do so , since the president , who is more or less kaczy\u0144ski lapdog , refused to sign the po-psl judge nominations . 
  and the constitution does n't address the possibility of the president refusing to do , because who the f & ck would ever predict something so retarded could happen ? ), 
  then the situation basically spiraled out of control as far as rhetorics go , with people calling the constitutional tribunal a communist organization , yada yada yada . 
  so yeah , po-psl crossed the line , then pis crossed another line , just much less subtly . 
  would they have left the tribunal alone if po-psl did n't try to game it ? 
  nobody f #cking knows . 
  maybe yes , maybe no . 
  fair enough , i 'll concede this point . 
  but i simply ca n't accept tomasz lis is in any way objective . 
  i 'm an avid reader of `` wprost '' for ... 11 years now ? 
  i started reading back when marek belka was still the prime minister , and i recall how the magazine supported the po-pis coalition ( seems like political fiction , nowadays ) , and how critical of the sld it was . 
  then after pis came to power in 2005 i recall how critical of the new government it was . 
  then after po-psl came to power , and lis became the editor-in-chief , the change of tone was staggering . 
  the magazine started being supportive of the government , even when it should n't be . 
  only after he got kicked out did the magazine regained its critical tone . 
  it 's hardly any proof , it 's purely anecdotal . 
  i 'd probably have more data , but frankly , i simply do n't bother myself with tv shows , so i 'll guess i 'll just concede here . 
  source , kind sir ? 
  this is hardly news . 
  sadly the current `` tradition '' is for every newly elected government to throw out the old media board , and install a new one . 
  obviously , this is done under the guise of `` we are removing the old politically biased journalist and replacing them with new , completly unbiased mind you , journalists '' . 
  is it a bad thing ? 
  yes . 
  but that 's how things are done in poland , and i do n't see it changing anytime soon . 
   those in the media who do n't toe the line are intimidated or suspended , as shown by the case of tv personality karolina lewicka . 
  while interviewing culture minister piotr gli\u0144ski , she asked him questions that he did n't like . 
  eventually , the politician said on camera that he would no longer answer her questions , because the station was `` broadcasting propaganda , and that would soon be over . '', 
  not exactly questions he did n't like , but rather she was performing a rather aggressive line of questioning , which minister gli\u0144ski , who is not a politician , but a university professor , did n't know how to handle and interpreted as an attack on his persona . 
  then again , the way the ruling party handled it later was really reprehensible . 
   a talk show hosted by tomasz lis - one of poland 's most famous journalists - has been canceled . 
  the journalist is currently the target of a smear campaign . 
  czaba\u0144ski said the show was `` not objective , biased , controlled and manipulated , '' and that the host was a `` propaganda puppet . 
  because he is biased . 
  horribly , horribly biased . 
  [ he even got an award for it . 
  ] ( http://www.sdp.pl/informacje/12175,hiena-roku-dla-tomasza-lisa,1450445659 ) i recall how he turned the most popular polish magazine `` wprost '' into what was basically a government propaganda outlet during his time as editor-in-chief . 
  only once they kicked him out `` wprost '' once again resumed its critical stance . 
  look , people , i do n't like the current government as much as any other liberal , but new like that are seriously blown out of proportion . 
  the only difference between what is pis doing to the media right now and what po-psl did to the media 8 years ago is that pis despises the media after years of critique , and do n't bother with playing nice - hell , they enjoy being as obnoxious as possible . 
  besides :  ** even before being brought before parliament ** , the polish government 's planned new media law is already making headlines . 
   new polish government 's plans for media reform , which although ** not officially introduced ** yet , then ** what the fuck ** are we even discussing here ?
