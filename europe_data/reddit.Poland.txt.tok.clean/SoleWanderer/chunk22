   tusk is going to come back and take the president 's seat after his european tenure he will get arrested and put in prison as soon as he steps out of plane on ok\u0119cie . 
   something poland is known for it 's one big massive jewish cementary , am i right ? 
   the thing is , that we ( im polish ) decided to forgive the germans the horrible sins . 
   not all of us . 
   fun fact : the bit about jews in poland being traditionally more left leaning , supporting socialists and in the past communists is actually quite true . 
  well , why should polish jews not be socialist ? 
  ethnic poles would focus on polish independence , jews were fully justified in not wanting it , but still wanting to improve the system ( which was more often than not tsarist feudalism ) . 
   what peasants did during the war makes for great psychological research for what people do during times of strife these were n't just `` peasants '' . 
  while yes , a lot of murders occured in the rural regions , people like local administration or schoolteachers often were involved . 
   go ask any old polish jews how poles treated jews before and during the war i really hate myself for asking this , but do you know how jews treated the poles before the war ? 
   that moral smugness is quite irritating , imagine if the germans acted the same way because one in 10,000 germans was a schindler . 
  and i do n't actually feel the slightest guilt in pointing out that the germans were willing perpetrators , while poles were citizens of an occupied country and victims and you do n't even care . 
  orban confirmed for fundamentalist . 
   also some people accuse tusk of smole\u0144sk crash but i do n't think kaczy\u0144ski is believing his own propaganda on this one . 
  someone is clearly responsible , why not tusk ? 
  so is tusk . 
  there 's a choice to leave ( stealing the effort the taxpayers did to provide you with education , safety and healthcare ) . 
  there 's a choice to vote against it . 
  there 's a choice to break the law . 
  this is a social norm you have to accept . 
   just give the damn choice ffs you have left the country where you pay no taxes and you complain of having no choice ? 
  you always have a choice , you can emigrate to country where there 's no taxes . 
   to be a good bridge player you 've got to be an intelligent guy to be good at anything you need skill . 
   analytical thinking , math , counting probability in a fast way these are only one facet of human intelligence . 
  so by being a polish patriot and letting young thieves get away scot free i let that happen ? 
  no wonder why your generation is full of mras and puas . 
   fuck that shit , i 'm not gon na be robbed most of my life . 
   so you rob me . 
   try playing pro-bridge . 
  in general being on a professional level in anything is hard , but does not equate high intelligence . 
  korwin has been a master in bridge in the 1970s ( and chess , as far as i know , has changed a lot since then ) . 
   and was against free healthcare/social which meant less taxes . 
  so you had been educated * for my taxes * , inoculated ** for my taxes ** , taken care of ** for my taxes ** for 18 years , and when you turned 18 and ** never worked a day ** in your life you decided you do n't want to pay taxes ? 
   no government or law should be created to handle things like marriage or companies or anything outside of very few things like army . 
  pretty sure he has proposed that instead of gay marriage the homosexuals could open up joint venture companies because they are exactly the same . 
   so his views on women is entirely placed on merit . 
   his view toward males is that they are the one that should only work and provide family everything it needs . 
  so men have a societal role but women have to work towards it ? 
   inteligent that ... what ? 
  a skill in playing a game does not actually mean intelligence . 
  actually he 's probably the only polish politician who carries a document claiming he 's sane . 
  but auschwitz is hardly a symbol of the town . 
  did you know that o\u015bwi\u0119cim has a castle ? 
  a good answer , you have convinced me . 
  first of all , i 'm a member of razem the first leftist party in poland since 1948 . 
  i am actively fighting the corrupt `` old boys '' network and cooperation of the government with the far right group . 
  second , you ca n't be part polish , you either are polish or are not . 
  it is occupying historic areas of warsaw ( most notably parts of jewish ghetto ) . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  it 's not `` just a building '' , it 's a symbol of the hated soviets . 
  that 's funny because i remember the soviet times and soviet troops leaving poland ... and recently russian soldiers returning to ukraine . 
  do you seriously compare the roman empire with the soviet union ? 
  how many people want to recover the roman empire in italy ? 
  the reason is almost half of century of occupation and imposing an inhuman regime over half of europe . 
  yes let 's retain the symbol of soviet domination , stalin 's dick rammed into old town center . 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa has admitted he has collaborated with the sb . 
  these twins were part of solidarno\u015b\u0107 from its beginnings . 
  it was lech kaczynski who was among the chief legal consultants of the union . 
   it is another layer of power removed from the people the guy who decides whether i pass or fail my driving exam is also not elected by the people , but is paid from my taxes . 
  why should i obey him ? 
   if you 're not able to make a few of your companies able to make profits as a state you sell them , because other people might be able to do that and some people maybe can keep their jobs . 
  except that it hardly ever happens . 
  unitra , for instance , was one of the biggest electronics producers and their products could compete with the foreign ones . 
  however , it was divided and disappeared from the market . 
  or take wedel - for almost 100 years this was poland 's iconic sweets producer . 
  it was quickly taken over by pepsi who wanted to reduce it to the producers of snacks . 
  but when cadbury bought it , it somehow turned out that it 's worth 3x more !, 
  or fsm - andrzej olechowski , one of po ( tusk 's party ) founders sold fso a factory hirin 25000 workers , worth 3 billions dollars for 75 million dollars . 
  i doubt that the alternative was to go bankrupt . 
  instead of letting people keeping their job most of the companies were simply closed down . 
  i 'm sorry but it was not `` there is no alternative '' , the people in power simply divided poland between themselves and the foreign investors who did n't care . 
   the state owned businesses had in parts to be sold because they were just not effective enough to compete on the international markets . 
  what makes you think so ? 
  somehow czechs still sell their skodas . 
   they will be faking outrage , but actually the result is what they planned from the beginning . 
  so you 're saying that kaczynski is playing 3d chess with the cuck liberals ? 
   indirectly related to current ruling party actually the publisher ( s\u0142owo niezale\u017cne ) is owned by sp\u00f3\u0142ka srebrna , which is essentially kaczynski 's private moneybank . 
  pis owns two large buildings in warsaw and funds their magazines with it . 
   look into how tusk played a part in overturning the first post communist government . 
  you 're thinking of kaczynski . 
  mazowiecki 's government folded when mazowiecki did n't get elected as president , due to walesa having kaczynski 's support . 
  because high schoolers ca n't start their own party . 
  http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,15942845,kaczynski__niemieckie_stocznie_funkcjonuja_dzieki.html somehow polish businesses bankrupt , but german businesses prosper . 
  in the second half of 2000s , poland was obliged by the european commission to stop state financial support for the state-owned shipyards and to privatise them . 
  http://www.maschinenmarkt.international/index.cfm?pid=14747&amp;pk=521982 http://spm.ucu.edu.ua/en/2016/06/02/privatisation-of-state-owned-enterprises-in-poland/ enough information for you ? 
  i believe that the german ( and western ) businesspeople try to seize control of polish economy and politics , often taking advantage of the dishonest 1990s privatisation . 
  eh , he 's gon na change the election ordination for the parliament ( like ergogan , he 's gon na raise the treshold to 10 % , eliminating sld , razem , korwin and maybe even nowoczesna ) , and turn kukiz or even rn into polish jobbik . 
  with that , po wo n't be able to defend tusk and kaczynski will be able to put him in prison or maybe even execute him like some in pis want to . 
  tusk is your standard neoliberal conservative , if you like eu going that way . 
  meanwhile the liberals enjoy nationalists ' tears . 
  a steak costs 80 zlotys , my daily budget for food is 25 zlotys . 
  so progressive that you elected a pimp to be a prime minister !, 
  is that bad ? 
  i 've never had one . 
  ( it is a long-term goal of mine ), 
  i would n't say that , i just dislike the entire western culture . 
  i heard that your president eats kfc chicken aboard of his private jet with golden furnishings , what a regular joe !, 
   poles do n't want them in their country because they know that they will probably stay here forever except that there will be more of them each year ... especially as the conflict in syria sharpens and the climate change deepens . 
  we should let some in , not only because it 's simply moral , but also to get experience with working with refugees , like doctors who simply know arabic ( who would be useful in the best case scenario ) . 
   if the west asks for help in the defense of the borders , we would probably send help speak for yourself - common borders of eu is the first step to creating a federal eu .
