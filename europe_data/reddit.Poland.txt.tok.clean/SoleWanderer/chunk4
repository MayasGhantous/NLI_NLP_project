  i listen to tr\u00f3jka and klub ludzi ciekawych wszystkiego , the host of that show has always been pretty catholic for example . 
   they provided at least a political alternative regarding the economy lol lowering cit for enterprises , introducing flat tax pit for businessmen , reforming the school system for the liberal , promising abolishing fiscal control for companies ... how is sld pro-worker ? 
  putin shill confirmed . 
   do n't want my taxes to go directly in the pocket of moronic populists fucking up the rule of law for their egotistic interest , playing against a majority of the population . 
  you know that pis has actually the majority and won the elections legally ? 
  and also , despite pis governing poland for only 5 months you also are 100 % that your taxes go into their pockets . 
  because what ? 
  polish people are thieves ? 
  eu is helping . 
  but it 's helping the people who do n't deserve help - the businesspeople , the government , the rich . 
  the ordinary poles do n't benefit from an `` aquapark '' built in their village , because they ca n't afford it and would rather have a kindergarden or a nurse office . 
  and the democracy empowers the rich capitalists . 
  people who lost their life savings , people whose companies got bankrupted were left with nothing and no possibility to improve their lives . 
  all this has been achieved through polish democracy , so why would n't we be dissatisfied with it ? 
   eastern european countries all rank lower on freedom of the press and fight against corruption . 
  https://index.rsf.org/#!/ it 's amazing . 
  poland is in the top 20 . 
  france is 38 . 
  italy 's not even in top 50 . https://www.transparency.org/country/ aaand poland is at the same level as france , well above italy and greece . 
  but okay , poland is fascist , that makes us all inferior to enlightened westerners . 
  we are always liars probably , after all all we have we owe to you . 
   you yourself said that democracy was not the way for your country to get out of its current problems . 
  well , sorry to break it to you , but that pretty means that democracy is not high on your list of principles . 
  i said that democracy caused a load of problems , like the privatisation and pauperisation of society . 
  the changes after 1989 hurt the poor the most - and this means the majority of poland . 
   if you are not happy that those billions served only your elite , then revolt . 
  that is exactly what pis is doing and you have the audacity to call them fascist for it . 
  that 's what the average janusz hears . 
  the fascist nazi state of poland , yes . 
   48 ct rulings during eight years of the previous government were ignored without any consequences whatsoever . 
  no the tiniest sign of discontent from eu . 
  maybe because they did n't ** ignore ** the ct rulings but the verdicts were n't implemented , because for instance other laws changed in the meantime . 
   how far do you think you could have gone , considering where you are coming from ? 
  wow . 
   eastern europe does not have democracy embedded in its blood , in its social dna . 
  wow . 
  however it 's a condition sine qua non to work with the western part . 
  if that 's not ok with you , then get lost . 
   them being democratically elected does not grant them a blank check to build a fascist state . 
  wow . 
  so let 's sum up ; eastern europeans are fascist by nature , and to improve it , they have to `` work with '' the west . 
  that is the nature of our cooperation according to you , and you wonder why we do n't want to ? 
  so before we joined the eu we were uncivilized starving monkeys with a totalitarian government who wanted to kill everyone . 
  you 're so disgustingly patronizing , `` oh , look at the untermeschen , they dare to reject our economic dominance '' . 
   if you are , the eu is no more foreign than the poland government is to polish regions . 
  so you now are telling so some german in brussels will tell me what to do . 
  brilliant . 
  it 's really amazing ; there must be numerous people worldwide who 'd jump at drop of a hat to implicate putin ... but all macierewicz seems to find are crackpots . 
  people had jobs , people had places to live , people were n't threatened by international terrorism . 
  yeah maybe if i could afford to ditch poland that 's `` constantly developing '' and moved to the west like 5 % of my compatriots already did , maybe my situation would be different . 
  but ** i have to live here ** . 
   not the eu 's problem that your government does n't work properly . 
  the one government that was endorsed by the eu and germany , whose head was awarded the fancy synecure in brussels for his obedience to merkel ? 
   but if you decide to go the whole `` yeh , fuck democracy ! '', 
  because democracy has worked out so great so far . 
   while part of a union that has democracy as an obligation for joining , and the same union that dares to question the democratic elections ? 
   do n't be surprised if the book gets thrown at you . 
  like what ? 
  hungary would block every attempt for sanctions . 
  if we prosper economically why is there so many discontents ? 
  the rich take the money , the trickle-down economics does not work . 
  that 's why democracy is ultimately disappointing . 
   poland is in a better position now than it has ever been in modern history . 
  ... and you base this belief on ... 
   increasing economic prosperity what ? 
  still 1/5 poles live in poverty . 
  also all those people who died in the smolensk incident were also replaced by po supporters . 
  ... you ca n't be that stupid . 
   the only bad thing which happened was the liberum votum . 
  * headdesk *, 
   the public media was staffed with people supporting the old government - because they did the same what pis is doing now not really . 
  they had still people like jan pospieszalski , for instance . 
  about as well as relying on the west . 
  that 's the thing . 
  for russia ukraine is historically one of their provinces . 
  so is poland . 
  poland generally does n't . 
  french tankettes did n't work that well last time . 
   russia is no military threat for europe , there are russian soldiers fighting in an european country right now . 
   exotic weirdos , yeah i see your open-mindedness already, 
  again , pis has voted for total abortion ban before . 
  i see that western europeans have no patience or will for eastern europeans . 
  sooner or later dutch would vote to kick out poland from eu . 
  then start your own party or read up on ones that interest you . 
  if you 're an idiot who votes for a party without knowing their stance on major issues , you deserve everything that happens to you . 
  what the hell . 
  szyd\u0142o herself has at least twice voted for total abortion ban and so did the vast majority of pis . 
  their voters knew well who are they voting for , i do n't know any pis voter who changed their opinion after they seized power . 
  why would she be there ? 
  for the record , the polandball is of / r/polska , the heart is from r/de , i 've cut out a lot of cruft words like `` things '' , combined some spelling mistakes etc. 
  and the actual threads : https://www.reddit.com/r/polska/comments/4dlzgt/what_do_poles_think_about_germany/ https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4dkt66/what_do_germans_think_about_poland/, 
  and the proof of this is ... 
   sovereignty is pass\u00e9 unless you are the united states , china or , maybe , putin 's russia . 
   source : gazeta polska gazeta polska is owned by pis members and supporters , for the record . 
  its parent group has been funded by - among other people - jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski and his companies , bought for money obtained for privatisation of `` ekspres wieczorny '' . 
    can polish woman do abortion in ukraine ? 
  is it still legal ? 
  assisting could be interpreted as assisting murder , so no . 
   working compromise as an abortion law now , personally i thought that was simply a bare minimum of human rights , and it was never working , with active underground and journeys abroad . 
  it got overthrown in 1989 .
