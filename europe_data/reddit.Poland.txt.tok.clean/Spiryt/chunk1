yeah , exactly - anyone that tries to apply a principle in * every single * scenario , eventually ends up painting themselves into an ideological corner . 
  like all of the above , they 'll find a reason to justify why they get the carrot . 
  `` it 's just our response to violence that 's ** already ** being done to us by government !, 
  they 're the * true * aggressors ! '', 
  this is true for most ideologies . 
  * theist ? 
  god . 
  * anarchist ? 
  non-aggression . 
  say what you want about humans , we 're sure great at improvising catch-all solutions ... 
  `` cobrastan is not real country . '', 
  to be fair the new president 's referendum questions would have been even worse . 
  * `` are you for retiring earlier and having to contribute less to get your full retirement ? '', 
  ( `` would you like some free stuff ? '', 
  with ** no ** plan of how this is going to be paid for ) * `` are you for maintaining how the national forest holding is currently being run ? '', 
  ( wtf , this is clearly a hot topic that nearly every pole loses sleep over . 
  i seriously think they only added this because 3 questions sounds better than 2 ) and * `` are you for making schooling compulsory from age 7 instead of 6 ? '', 
  ( because why bother having the department of education research the topic when you can ask every tom , dick , and harry their opinion ? ), 
   median salary was below some new eu countries , like poland out of interest , where did you find the median salary values for poland ? 
  afaik it 's been a long point of contention that the govt only releases average ( ie mean ) salaries to hide the level of inequality ... 
   the whole `` 70 cents for the dollar '' is bullshit , but any wage statistic database will tell you that women get paid less than men . 
  in aggregate . 
  once you control for education , years of experience , choice of field , willingness to move , readiness to do overtime / work weekends and so on , the ` pay gap ' disappears into statistical irrelevance . 
  i 'm not sure how to solve that . 
  make it illegal to reward people for the above ? 
  [ it 's also worth noting that women who never married and never had children out-earn their male peers ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052748704421104575463790770831192 ) . 
  bless , she 's practicing her waving ... a long way to go until [ elizabeth ii ] ( http://pixel.nymag.com/content/dam/custom/images/2012/06/queenelizabeth70s.gif ) levels , though , 
  you call the police , maybe they can suggest somewhere less disruptive . 
  fwiw i really respect the way germany treats its homeless - giving them parts of the subway in frankfurt to sleep at night etc. 
  so many people just want them out of sight by any means necessary ... 
  this is true - if you 're willing to play by the rules , you 'll be on the streets for 1-2 weeks ( roughly the wait time for a non ` one-off ' place in the hostels ) . 
  two complications - most hostels let you stay one month ( though some up to six ) . 
  some would argue that 's plenty of time to get your life together , but i 'm not so sure . 
  the second is that most hostels have a policy of abstinence - no drugs , no alcohol . 
  in an ideal world that should n't be a problem , but a lot of people end up homeless precisely because of ` double diagnosis ' - substance addiction and mental illness . 
  i donated 15 + pints of blood while i lived in the uk , fun to think that it 's about double my body 's total, 
  so now they know that neither does defensive architecture ( if you want to keep your customers / reputation at least ) . 
  hopefully a valuable lesson for them and others . 
  so you act like a civilized human being - explain the situation and ask them to move . 
  you do n't go ahead and erect passive-aggressive spikes on the ground . 
  i 've got an encampment of homeless folks living 100m from my flat . 
  my attitude is certainly not `` gtfo '' . 
  part of the problem is the passive-aggressive method these spikes represent , like the spikes on parapets to ward off pigeons and other vermin . 
  i do n't see them as evil - just selfish . 
  children are born selfish , and raised to be mindful of other people through societal pressure ... 
  the same is needed for our companies and institutions . 
  good . 
  hit the corporations and institutions right where it hurts the most - their wallets and reputations . 
  anti-homeless spikes , destroying homeless people 's tents ... #britishvalues indeed . 
  our office is now disabling some lifts , lowering all blinds , asking us to turn off our lights and considering disabling ac . 
  i work in it , they should ask us to turn off our computers too . 
  there are going to be painful measures either way - the question is whether they want to : * live within their meager means for the next few decades , under strict supervision from other european countries . 
  * face immediate destitution , but retain their sovereignty . 
  i ca n't comment on which of these two options is ` better ' - the people of greece can decide that . 
  leaving means abject poverty ... but at least it 's * their * poverty , that they get to one day say they climbed out of . 
  that 's exactly why i think `` will population x be better off economically when independent ? '', 
  are stupid . 
  it should n't matter - if the people believe they must have their own country , you ca n't attach a price to that . 
  i had a problem on arriving back in poland - all the cider was unbearably sweet , think kopparberg . 
  this was a problem even with ` trusted ' brands like somersby ( ?! ) . 
  my current favourite is [ mi\u0142oslawski ] ( http://www.browarfortuna.pl/images/tapety/cydr_sg2.jpg ) . 
  any particular reason the graph starts at 300 bln ? 
  [ why is that number significant ? 
  `` i 'm not racist/sexist but ... '' has apparently evolved into `` i ca n't be racist/sexist because ... '', 
  as someone who has lived in the uk and out for roughly equal amounts of time , this is mainly because of built-up resentment over britain 's historical dealings with the eu . 
  the prevailing feeling is that the uk wants a built-in exception to every other important piece of legislature passed in brussels , not unlike [ the usa 's handling of un treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_treaties_unsigned_or_unratified_by_the_united_states ) . 
  this is n't hatred , it 's ideological differences over the future of the continent - europe is simply as fed up with the uk 's exceptionalism as the uk is with europe 's ` power grabs ' . 
  had the result swung 2 % in the other direction , they would be called accomplices to ` eu bureaucrats ' who needed some patriotism beaten into them . 
  the real devil is the remain campaign who utterly failed to present a positive case for eu membership and persuade these people their vote is worth it . 
  somewhat disingenuous - a good chunk of that 31 million is made up of people not allowed to vote ( not uk citizens / < 18 years old ) . 
  the real number of missing votes is [ 13 million ( of 46.5 million ) ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results ) . 
  no , that 's what the ecj is for . 
   the rules of the association are unfortunately vague as they never expected anyone to leave . 
  you helped write them . 
  what do you do , when people complain that they are cold , and that they felt warmer when they had red jackets 30 years ago , and that all jackets should be painted red so they can be warm again ? 
  do you tell them it 's 21 degrees ? 
  they 'll insist it feels colder than that . 
  do you tell them the colour of the jacket has nothing to do with how warm it is ? 
  they 'll tell you you 're an out-of-touch elite who has no idea what it 's like to feel cold . 
  do you run a scientific study , showing that there is no meaningful correlation between jacket colour and warmth ? 
  they 'll tell you that the sample size was inadequate , and that it flies in the face of what they feel with their own skin . 
  or do you simply throw your hands in the air and let them paint the jackets red , comfortable in the knowledge you tried everything ? 
  well , we 're about to find out whether the poor man 's reply rings true ...  better scraps off the master 's table , than no scraps at all !, 
  the guy was talking about the hordes of ( modern ! ), 
  muslims frothing at the mouth to rape , murder , and destroy their way through the west - and how we 'll be thanking the likes of him once we have a modern crusade to cleanse the middle east ... 
  i do n't think anyone is claiming that there is no problem ? 
  mhm , iraq was sold as a ` defensive measure ' too . 
  you should n't have to include ` people who had any kind of electric shock in the last year ' in a statistic of ` people struck by lightning in the last year ' to make it look more serious . 
  great , i ca n't wait for the new crusades so that europeans can once again go raping , murdering , and torturing while destroying everything in the middle east . 
  aka horseshoe theory ? 
  i think the word ` populist ' has been diluted , much like fascism and communism ( see direct comparisons between eu and the third reich / soviet union ) . 
  populism has a specific meaning , and it is not ` doing what the electorate broadly wants ' . 
  i personally do n't see the european parliament in general pushing the narrative of `` large alienated element of population against a government seen as controlled by an out-of-touch closed elite that acts on behalf of its own interests '' . 
  i do see ukip , fn , afd , etc. 
  pushing the above . 
  that 's the beauty of a democratic system . 
  if you do the opposite of what the people you represent want , you 're going to lose your job . 
  want to keep your job ? 
  go do what the people that can re-elect you want , and make sure they know you 're doing it . 
  win-win ,
