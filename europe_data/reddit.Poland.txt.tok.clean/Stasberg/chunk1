well , if that happens i will have to update that equation . 
  that 's italian . 
  safe europe = europe - ( typical balkan things + russia ), 
  oh , thanks . 
  had no idea about it . 
  there were a lot of reports in polish media in last few years about czech government spending tons of money on advertisement campaigns against polish food . 
  is it really a big case in czechia to * fight * with polish products ? 
  i know that currently poland is financing campaign called [ ja love polske jidlo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d894shcduj4 ) . 
  source ? 
  there are no reports of such attack in polish media besides one youtube movie which is actually fake . 
  it 's called * kibice legii wyszli na ulice , ci\u0119\u017cko pobili muzu\u0142ma\u0144skich imigrant\u00f3w * ; however it 's an old video from the states ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) and has nothing to do with legia supporters . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong , but once they acquire polish citizenship they can legally move and work in other eu countries . 
  the thing is that they do n't want to stay in poland , not only because of low welfare . 
  wages in poland are significantly lower than in western europe , they will leave as soon as they can . 
  do n't worry , i did n't make myself clear . 
  well , perhaps i made it look like it 's something i would like to happen . 
  i do n't , it would be childish . 
  i just wanted to show how easy it can be to get a citizenship in poland . 
  that 's true , it is not that hard to acquire polish citizenship , [ here ] ( https://msw.gov.pl/en/document/ways-of-acquiring-poli/793,ways-of-acquiring-polish-citizenship.html ) is the official information . 
  fun fact , we could send them right away to germoney , if our president would grant them polish citizenship . 
  edit : / u/t0varich fixed , thanks !, 
  yeah , both onions and garlic . 
  my friend dressed up as a frenchman and he looked exactly like that guy from the picture , but he also had a necklace made of onions . 
  where are the onions ? 
   set up and train militias in these refugee camps to retake their country this is so unreal and silly , there is no way it wo n't backfire . 
  jan pawe\u0142 approves . 
  there was no point in asking , we would confuse you with slovakia anyway . 
   what about slovenia ? 
   you already asked me ` bout them !, 
  slovakia much funny language 10/10, 
  really ? 
  i had no idea that polish parliament has anything to say in regards to ttip , i thought it 's a deal between usa and ue . 
  could you provide a source for your statement ? 
  i would love to know more about this . 
  it has nothing to do with consulting the people . 
  elections are coming and pis is trying to sway eurosceptics ' votes . 
  yesterday i read a report stating that a someone threw a child behind the fence causing serious injuries to the child . 
  what kind of parents do that ? 
   in fact , the court reportedly ordered him to be expelled from hungary and prohibited from returning within one year . 
  i guess the court will jail people only if it 's impossible to determine migrants ' nationality . 
  oh yes , i never understood the idea of paywalls ; however , the article is authors ' / journals ' property and i 'm pretty sure that this is illegal to copy whole article even if the source is provided . 
  would it be legal ? 
  i think some sites would n't be happy about it . 
  just ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ central european things . 
  oh yeah , if anyone is interested in * filipinos desease * of our ex-president i recommend watching this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afcgeyubv00 ) . 
  they probably would not know [ what to do with it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dilbxfwddgk ) . 
  that 's interesting , i had no idea . 
  i doubt / u/krkus refers to translation , you did a good job there , but since you brought it up , perhaps cruel fate would be more fitting . 
  nah , i have heard of him and he has really bad press in poland and abroad . 
  his books were criticised vividly by polish historians as he basically tried to blame poles for holocaust . 
  i know that english-speaking historians has criticised his books ( i can think of davis and finkelstein right now ) . 
   but actually during the war killed more jewish people than german people . '', 
  what ? 
  edit :  for centuries their ancestors emigrated en masse , fleeing from material poverty and political persecution . 
  yeah , since germany , austria and russia decided to wipe poland off the maps for two centuries . 
  this guy is top kek . 
   there shoud be a law againt preaching islamic fundamentalism , though , that would be the solution , in my opinion . 
  i have heard that france has already taken some steps to limit that kind of preaching by limiting the flow of qatar money to mosques . 
  i would n't count on poland tbh . 
  there are elections in one month so our politics are ( at least ) unsure and it 's really hard to predict what will happen . 
  it 's unspeakable . 
  edit : damn , so many people did n't get the pun ; _ :, 
  france 40 % ( 1740 ) i think lots of people forgot that in france you actually need to speak french :(, 
  well , i would say that fixing that window is n't really a good thing , but it is necessary . 
  stopping whatever causes breaking the window ( so war , poverty , famine , etc. ), 
  would be a good thing . 
  okay , from my perspective : / u/jpinkidu provided data about taxpayers money distribution and creation of additional work places for public officers ( police ) . 
  you responded that this is good because :  the government money goes back straight into the german economy creating jobs for the locals . 
  and this is where the fallacy is . 
  the government could spend that money on something else , because before the refugee crisis there were more pressing matters that required that aid from the government , right ? 
  thus that money would circulate anyway , resulting in increase of aggregate demand . 
  so to fit it into the context : broken mirror = refugees , shopkeeper = german society , glaziers = police and housing industry . 
  i do n't understand what you are getting at . 
  / u/shirinator made a point about fallacy in your sentence , that 's all . 
  do n't you understand that basically all he is saying that germany would have spend this money anyway , refugees or not , taxpayers ' money would be redistributed . 
  i did n't mean to claim that there were ** national anthems ** in medieval europe . 
  probably my fault , should have made it clearer . 
  there is also a cover of tri martolod partly in polish by [ rycz\u0105ce shannon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mswmry4_qzo ) ( roaring shannon ) and i think it 's awesome . 
  tbh , soundtrack from ogniem i mieczem is pretty great too . 
  amazing !, 
  i suppose poland is going to catch up soon , i have read an article stating that everyday there is at least one new brewery opening in poland . 
  i think that 's too optimistic but the market is changing and people are shifting from terrible commercial beer to quality beers and wine . 
  [ bogurodzica ] ( https://youtu.be/nrhhjoyahdo?t=30s ) is said to be the first polish anthem , long before the commonwealth . 
  some people claim that it was also commonwealth 's anthem , but it 's hard to confirm whether it was an anthem - i doubt it . 
  all we can tell for sure that this can be classified as a hymn , it 's one of the oldest polish poetry as scholars notes that it had been in use long before monks wrote it down . 
  oh and it is entirely in old-polish . 
  supposedly , it was sung before battles . 
  [ wiki for more info on bogurodzica . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogurodzica ) there is an older hymn , entirely in latin - [ gaude mater polonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv8lrictwxe ) . 
  again supposedly , polish knights used to sing it after a victory . 
  seriously ? 
  almost in every thread you can see gib back our money . 
  anyway , i just ignore them and advice everyone to do the same . 
  yeah , i have heard that there are at least 450 breweries in california alone . 
  in poland there are only about 120 breweries . 
  pacific is the best pale ale i have ever tried . 
  there were some one-time brews that i 'm looking forward to drink again . 
  oh and they have the coolest logo . 
  oh , they do , but unfortunately not everyone . 
  i wish more dog owners in poland would clean after their dogs .
