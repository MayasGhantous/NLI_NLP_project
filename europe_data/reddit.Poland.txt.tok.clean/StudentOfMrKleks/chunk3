  paying for death penalty for some of them is a massive waste of taxpayers money . 
  resources are n't unlimited . 
   i 'd only do it in the cases where their guilt is pretty clear cut you 're such a good guy , i previously thought that you were going to do it only in unclear situation . 
  yeah , he was governor of california . 
  i would be worried if pis won parliamentary election , i 'm on the opposite end of political spectrum , but i consider duda much better candidate than his opponent . 
  komorowski is a fucking joke . 
  but he would probably rather use this version : what outcry have you uttered about my person , you oafish brute ? 
  i shall cordially remind you that i was the best scholar in my law class in oxford , and i have been involved in several frivolous tea parties and courtroom disputes , and i have over 300 boxes of earl gray . 
  i am proficient in the simian school of diplomacy and i am the top linguist in my book club . 
  know that you resemble nothing in my eyes save for yet another uncultured mind . 
  i will hasten your undisputed expiritation of the world with grace and finesse . 
  the thought that you can retreat after jesting of such matters over the internet is laughable . 
  as of this moment , i am telephoning a mutual friend to negotiate a swift and sure rebuttal to your argument so i would implore you to prepare yourself for the upcoming verbal deluge . 
  the deluge that will no doubt saturate your life with discomfort . 
  you are well and truly wrong , my good sir . 
  my abilities of travel are unmatched , and i can recite over 700 lines from shakespeare , and that is just from hamlet . 
  the amount of knowledge that i have acrued is vast , and i shall use it to firmly state my authority on such matters , you rapscallion . 
  truly , i wished you had some semblance of knowledge on the matter you have brought up and it 's repercussions . 
  alas , you did not , and now you will suffer a fate most dire , you plebian . 
  i shall defecate concentrated dislike upon you and you shall struggle to survive in it 's waters . 
  pistols at dawn , old boy . 
  a transsexual , no a transvestite . 
   they we 're not . 
  you 've meant `` they were not '' ? 
  i was confused by this . 
  poppy is symbol of the world war ii in poland two , it came from monte cassino battle . 
  we even have song about it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iab33qfdw-g, 
  australian navy knows . 
   why are those people taking on the risk to die to get here ? 
  and they risk their money too . 
  and poland is a belgium of the east . 
  polish television gets government donations , because people massively avoid paying license fee . 
  it was renamed 31st december 1989 . 
  we tried to help them by bombing them and it seems that it did n't work . 
  i have n't heard that you have civil war in croatia . 
  king fahd granted constitution for saudi arabia . 
  i have n't received military training , but i 'm avid 4chan reader , so i would fight in internet brigades . 
  does he ? 
  he thinks it would be easy to get away for the country during war and that the west would love to take care of milions of polish refugees . 
   my guess it 's because of how `` well '' the governments have treated the citizens , so that if shit hits the fan they 're like , yeah , take it , we 're outta here . 
  both romania and poland have been since 1989 under best and most citizen-friendly governance in their entire history . 
  bunch of netizens , who have no idea about living as refugee and think it is just as nice as migratory worker 's life do n't change that fact . 
  if you would double military budget and increase propaganda budget tenfold , in ten years you would have just as much brainwashed society as russia has now . 
  and they would be `` first to fight '' just as poles before the last world war , carefuly crafted by country spending 40 % of its budget on military . 
  do you realise that uon-b was created by bandera , but a year before volhynia massacre bandera was put in the concentration camp , so you should n't claim his responsibility for it . 
  it is like accusing nietzsche for holocaust . 
   one also could have included the fact , that stalin did watch from away and did not interfere , while one goal of the uprising was also to free the city before the russians invaded - but that is not part of a headline . 
  you confused warsaw uprisings . 
  read the topic , i provided the source , i did n't want to copy my post . 
   the feeling i get from my own experience `` feeling and faith speak more clearly to me than the lenses and eye of the sage . '' ? 
  :d polls show that only 25 % poles side with pis , and 45 % side with tribunal and oposition . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/49tiz9/what_is_going_on_between_the_new_polish/ since then , ruling was n't published . 
   the opinions are split 50-50 no , they are not . 
  http://telewizjarepublika.pl/co-polacy-sadza-o-konflikcie-wokol-trybunalu-konstytucyjnego-sondaz,30735.html 45 % side with oposition and 25 % side with pis in the entire conflict . 
  74 % want government to publish tribunal 's ruling , 19 % do not want . 
  great news . 
  yeah , eight-year-old fighters . 
  one third of them were civilians . 
  actually , morocco would like to be the eu member . 
  shit , maybe teutonic knights were right when they acussed us of not christening lithuania properly . 
  someone needs to work for all these pensioners . 
  i bet pole or french wrote the title . 
  title : `` fear of poland '' subtitle : `` european lefties are scared of ours conservative contrrevoution . '', 
   so that something goes into the dutch government coffers rather than nothing going into dutch coffers , netherlands 's economy is 7th biggest in the eu . 
  somehow 19 countries with smaller economies are able to close their budgets just fine without trying to act as tax haven . 
   1 : this is a sign made for kids . 
  yeah , because most of british or german kids are gon na associate themselves with native americans .

  oh no , they have different opinion than mine , they have to clearly be polonophobes !, 
  yes , they are taking away children from polish and czech immigrants and they make hummus out of them for refugees . 
  are you stuck in 2004 ? 
  or just penalize it without treason classification .

  poland is same way . 
  no , it is n't in public domain , it will be in january . 
  but paradox games do n't have hot seat mode . 
  because ireland has n't yet published stats on growth in q3 . 
  i wish more poles would see that , so they can change their negative view on poland . 
  red on polish flag is just from our coat of arms , this symbolizing blood thing is just some poethic bullshit . 
   dzie\u0144 \u015awira ( a crazyguy day ) a day of wacko . 
  i do n't think putin is gon na conquer america that fast . 
   in august 2005 the georgian ambassador to israel lasha zhvania asked that the hebrew speakers refer to his country as `` georgia '' \u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d9\u05d4 and abandon the name `` gruzia '' . 
  a similar request was issued by georgia , in december 2009 , to lithuania , asking to be called `` georgija '' instead of `` gruzija '' ; the request was forwarded to the commission of the lithuanian language . 
  in june 2011 , the ministry of foreign affairs of georgia said south korea had agreed to refer to the country as `` georgia '' instead of the russian-influenced `` gruzya '' and the government of georgia was continuing talks with other countries on the issue . 
  in april 2015 , japan changed the official japanese name for georgia from `` gurujia '' ( \u30b0\u30eb\u30b8\u30a2 ? 
  ) , which derives from the russian term `` gruziya , '' to `` j\u014djia '' ( \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b8\u30a2 ? 
  ) , which derives from the english term `` georgia '' . 
  your country officials seem to think differently . 
  you mean sakartvelo . 
  but he killed the guy who killed hitler . 
  the policeman in glasses looks like he was stonoga 's son .
