  so some people side with judicary system - some with government . 
  and now we have a fight experienced judicary system vs. democratically elected government with growing support . 
  i believe it is called autocracy ? 
  ok . just inform baltic states that they must pay a border fee once we leave eu . 
  they will be delighted . 
  the diffrence between what we put in , and take out from eu is getting smaller every year . 
  if they will take right of vote from us and impose sanctions there will be no reason to stay in eu . 
  as we would be loosing more by being in eu than being outside . 
  that is why they call it `` nuclear '' solution . 
  it is likely to remove more countries from eu . 
  well - support for pis grew from that time - while opposition lost some support - so i guess that most people like it . 
  even pro opposition media show that . 
  we will see how the situation unravels . 
  this is a very idealistic approach . 
  my point was that judges are not robots but humans . 
  and they have their beliefs . 
  and thei interpretate the law in accordance to those beliefs . 
  i do not shun them , for being humans , but as such they should bear responsibility for what they do - as everyone else . 
  if you remove the responsibility factor you will simply remove judges from cause - effect chain - and it will end with stupid decisions - having no support in society ( called dead law ) . 
  and to some extent - law is a popularity contest - people elect those who promise to create more popular laws . 
  we simply hit the wall . 
  we are now forced to choose between democracy and law - as those are currently opposite to one anoteher . 
  majority of poles support the actions that are in opposition to the law . 
  is there even a definition for such situation ? 
  anarchy ? 
  read entire text . 
  in second link you will read that judges in germany are independant only in decision making process and nothing else . 
  not that entire judicary is independant as a whole as was in poland untill now . 
  if we will get prosecuted by that than so would germany . 
  and somehow i doubt brussel would prosecute berlin . 
  that is a bit overkill dont you think ? 
  what i am talking about is responsibility . 
  both president and government can loose the elections if they are a faliure in governing . 
  so they can be pulled to anwser for their decisions ( via elections and loss of power ) who has the power to exrot responsibility from court and judicary system ? 
  for being ineffetive , or for harmfull decisions ? 
  currently no one . 
  which is the perfect breeding ground for coruption . 
  i dont think that this is a right and final solution ( what pis is doing ) but the situation needed to be changed . 
  here is a link to some european systems . 
  i linked to germany and it is stated clearly https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_judicial_systems_in_member_states-16-de-en.do?member=1 `` administration of courts the courts of the l\u00e4nder are generally administered by the ** federal ministries of justice ** . 
  at the federal level , ** the federal minister of justice is responsible for the federal court of justice , the federal administrative court and the federal finance court ** . 
  the federal ministry of labour and social affairs is responsible for the federal labour court and the federal social court . 
  the responsible ministries also administer the necessary budgetary resources . 
  the only exception is the federal constitutional court , which has been granted organisational autonomy as an independent constitutional organ . 
  it presents its own court budget for approval . '', 
  this is even more than ziobro will get . 
  and here is info on germany from wiki on federal courts and personnel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judiciary_of_germany ** professional judges ** the federal courts are administered by the federal government , all the other courts belong to a state and are administered by it . 
  ** the independence of the judiciary that is laid down in the federal constitution ( article 97 para . 
  1 ) only refers to the judicial decision-making process of any individual judge , not to the judicial power as a whole . 
  ** in line with this , the courts are administrative bodies ** subordinate ** to the respective department of justice , special rules only applying to the judicial decision-making process and the status of the judges . 
  all professional judges are members of a common corps in that they are recruited through a common process and their career is governed largely by federal law . 
  [ 8 ] however , most judges are state ( l\u00e4nder ) civil servants and follow state rules on legal education , appointment , and promotion . 
  i would cross out eu from that list . 
  before they voted on taking any action - russians would alredy be in brussel . 
  plus - i did not say `` facing alone '' russia - but making us very hard to bite . 
  as turkey did . 
  the point is that current situation made judicary system separated - not only from government - but also from people . 
  the judges were the only ones electing another judges and so created a system separated from the society . 
  i know what separation of powers is . 
  i know it is necessary . 
  but situation in which no one has anything to say about judicatory system aside from judicary system itself is sick . 
  we already had that sort of system in the past ( nobility had all the power and all attempts changes were hampered ) - it led to our downfall . 
  i am not saying that current government is innocent - or that they do n't have ulterior motive . 
  i 'm simply stating that situation untill now was sick . 
  what do you have aggainst turkey ? 
  we could learn from them . 
  they were once a very poor and marginal country . 
  now they are main power in middle-east with powerfull army and economy . 
  if we were like them - we would not need to suck up to usa to protect us from russia . 
  as far as i know the changes will make our law simillar to that in western eu . 
  they will simply not allow the judges work as hereditary monarchy anymore . 
  is it a bad thing to copy the law from west eu if it works there ? 
  they may shout if they want - but we are finally leaving the last remnants of communism behind us . 
  no more self appointing group of judges will have control over poland 's law . 
  those to criticize that should remember that first group of judges in poland were in fact communist judges - and they were picking the like-minded people for the better and more influential places in the system . 
  nobody could do a shit with that because the law gave them too much power and authority . 
  after 28 years it is over finally . 
   when they sink their boats , we should collect them and ship them back , without taking them to greek soil . 
  unless someone desperately needs medical aid . 
  given their current approach , as soon as they see a boat they would start harming themselves to be admitted to hospitals . 
  this is no solution . 
  there should be no exeptions - otherwise those exeptions will be exploited . 
  i know this sounds outright cruel - but europe slowly is reaching its limits . 
  i tremble when i think what will happen when eu runs out of resources . 
  i ca n't speak for all ee but poland for example did three things recently . 
  1 ) our `` xenophobic '' governent doubled funds for upkeep of external refugee camps ( outside europe ) 2 ) we sent border security personel and equipment to hungary to help them in maintaining their `` fence '' 3 ) warsaw become the location for frontex centre - and it recieves more support from us ( frontex ) . 
  i know that i might not be impressive - but we are poor country with russia breathing on our necks . 
  we have a survival issue on our hands and i seriously doubt that ee could be seen as `` safe '' regarding russia recent moves . 
  the war is not going on - but situation here resembles more and more situation between north and south korea . 
  i asked about army . 
  would you use it aggainst separatist country that wants to leave ? 
  like england ? 
  sepearatist - is someone who no longer wants to be in `` unity '' - so separatist armies would be armies of coutries wanting to leave eu . 
  i thought it is legal to leave eu . 
   i can see the rationale behind that , but i would say that if arrivals are , let 's exagerate , a million people , 50 camps of 20 thousand capacity each are more manageable than 2 or 3 camps with a capacity 500k or 350k , plus there is the fact that those camps would bring a social burden to only one or two nations . 
  the main reason behind it would be a huge `` push '' factor . 
  if they realize that only thing they can count on is vegetation untill peace is achieved - they would not come unless their lives were really in danger . 
  only desperate people ( real refugees ) would come to europe - and therfore be in camps and we would pay for their food and necessities ( medical care , clothes , education for children ) . 
  entire eu would pay for it so there would not be much `` social burden '' . 
  they would live in camps and be returned to their homeland when the war is over .
