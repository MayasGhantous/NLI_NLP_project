  ** ** `` eu leaders are trying to prove that they are still useful , needed and in spite of the logic and the facts , because the laws we propose are exactly or almost the same as those in germany , spain , the netherlands , austria . 
  but the reality is that this is the trouble of this european establishment , that it still has to prove its usefulness and sense of its action , `` said the pis politician . 
  ** the ec announced on 19th july that it is close to launching the art . 
  7 of the eu treaty allowing sanctions in connection with the planned changes in the judiciary in poland . 
  `` they bring the independence of the courts and threaten the rule of law in poland , '' said timmermans . 
  he also announced that this week the ec would prepare a procedure for infringement by poland . 
  eu law provides that not only the european commission , but also the european parliament or one third of the member states , can apply for the launch of this provision of the eu treaty . 
  eu countries may , by a majority of four-fifths , obtain `` eps ' explicit risk of serious infringement '' . 
  it is only in the next step that the european council - the heads of state or government - can unanimously open the way to sanctions . 
  foreign minister witold waszczykowski , speaking on tuesday in the `` signals of the day '' on radio one to president andrzej duda 's decision on vetoing two laws : the supreme court and the national judicial council , said : `` i assess this from the point of view of influence on our foreign policy . 
  so far , i do not see any influence on our foreign policy . 
  maybe tomorrow will see whether this decision of the president has been positive or negative if the european commission responds , anyway '' - admitted the minister . 
  `` i hope that , at least for foreign policy , this decision will have a positive impact . '', 
  the head of the polish ministry of foreign affairs , referring to the wednesday statement of ec deputy frans timmermans , said on thursday that `` the legislative process on judicial change is underway and - until it is finished , we do not need to explain anything '' . 
  we have the same with tvn and gazeta wyborcza . 
  those media in poland also pictured that crisis the same way german media did . 
  so it is not only german problem . 
  and they even dare to call other media - `` politically oriented '' . 
  this is madness . 
  ec should keep an eye on germany - this is political influence on judicary - if they do not change it back - article 7 and sanctions . 
  i did not say they should anwser to government - but in some other way they should not be irremovable - as it is now . 
  current situation generated corruption - and for 28 years it did not improved . 
  it was n't pis original idea to reform judicary - the idea is old now . 
  the way they did it made people protest - but everyone agree that current situation can not go on . 
  judicary must be held accountable for its transgrssions . 
  nobody should be the holy cow . 
  we are past monarchy or communism . 
  the opposition is protecting judicary as it is consisted of mostly liberal oriented people - therfore it is in opposition best interest to keep the status-quo - even aggainst people . 
  my guess is that if it is 3rd power - it should also be elected in direct voting . 
  then judicary mandate to judge would be stronger than it is now . 
  plus nobody would protest in poland . 
  so we will have pulling the rope here . 
  both pis and president ( and most poles ) want the judicary to anwser to someone . 
  only difference is - to whom ? 
  so we are in for another shitstorm in autumn . 
  i wonder what will be in that reform projects . 
  dear fellow citizens , ladies and gentlemen !, 
  even during the election campaign , i emphasized that the president should serve the two states - the nation and the polish state . 
  the president 's task is to take good care of the nation and to do everything to ensure his well-being and safety andrzej duda said in his message . 
  the task of the president is also to care for the quality of functioning of the state and its institutions . 
  justice is one of those institutions that play an extremely important role in the socio-political system . 
  from the quality of its functioning , the trust of society to the state and its institutions stressed head of state . 
  in recent years , the postulate of reform of the judiciary has been repeated many times . 
  unfortunately , many people have been harmed by justice and have a deep sense of injustice . 
  the public expects the judges to be professional , ethical and crystal-clear that they will be judging the verdicts as they swear - impartially , in their own conscience , but also that they will justly justice against the people . 
  that the referee behind the stack of records on his table will see the one who stands before him and expects just justice . 
  - the president pointed out . 
  without reform of the judiciary , there is no way to build a just state , which equally treats all citizens to which the poles have confidence . 
  changes are necessary at the procedural , formal , but also ethical level - said the head of state . 
  the reform of the judicial system , developed by the parliament , largely met social expectations . 
  but as president i could not accept and use the right of veto , because they needed changes that would ensure their conformity with the constitution , to ensure the independence of the judiciary , ** but without a sense of absolute superiority and impunity ** , and to create conditions for the judges to feel independent of the various pressures . 
  - claimed the president . 
  in the near future , i will present new versions of the judicial reform projects . 
  ** i believe that in the shortest possible time these amended laws will be passed by the polish parliament , wise , pro-state , and above all the pro-social reform of the judiciary will become a reality . 
  people are waiting for this ** `` he stressed . 
  from almost the camp `` good change '' reforms poland . 
  so that our state would be more citizen friendly . 
  i am deeply convinced that a solid and well-prepared reform of the courts will contribute to building a better future for our country as a just and powerful country . 
  states that respect and protect ordinary people . 
  after all , we all dream to live in a free , democratic , safe and prosperous country . 
  thank you very much andrzej duda finished . 
  well - there are plans for milion . 
  right-side is mobilizing for next weekend to march aggainst corruption in courts and to remove last remnants of communism in poland . 
  they plan to gather milion of people . 
  and to convince president not to veto anything . 
  so the fun might yet start . 
  if the current protests will not stop by then . 
  timmermans has a tough nut to crack now . 
  1 of 3 bills passes - he claimed that all are harmfull and each may trigger article 7 . 
  still - duda is now seen as someone who unite poland and is making sides to actually start dialogue ( at least on the surface ) . 
  if timmermans launches article 7 now - while poles try to actually talk to one another and decide which way to go with reforming judicary - the sympathy for eu will go significantly down in poland - among all groups . 
  and that would have better chances to lead to polexit than anything else . 
  yep - many countries felt that on their skin, 
  the truth never stopped germans from imposing their vision of the world on others - why would that one be any diffrent ? 
  yeah but what next ? 
  pis wanted to make sc theirs - they failed duda says he will propose his own reform - without changes in judicary personell it will be rejected by pis claiming that it is just - `` powdering corpse '' - not removing real problems but only hiding symptoms . 
  unless president does something that society would have influence over courts - his reforms would be rejected . 
  and we would be left with the current shitty system . 
  i doubt there are other options for changes other than to have supreme court elected in direct voting by citizens ( maybe connected with other election to save money ) . 
  brussel could be angry - but it would not bring anyone on the street in poland . 
  i would be delighted, 
  would be nice to go public with it then ? 
  you missed the point of my anwser - look beyond word `` nazi '', 
  nazi judges sentenced many people for being traitors to the death . 
  does fact that those people actually might have acted aggainst 3rd reich make those judges any better ? 
  being racist is dependant from the point of view . 
  dependant on your personal beliefs - you `` judge '' such a person . 
  ** just as being rich or poor - you judge based on your financial status . 
  ** someone attacked or robed by migrant from mena will not call anyone a racist anymore . 
  someone feeding hungry children in africa might for a change consider everyone opposed to migration as a racist . 
  everyone beliefs are based on their experiences and informations gathered . 
   judges do n't make policy , they apply laws . 
  if the a peticular application of laws does not fit the legislature they must and can change the law . 
  how is this so hard to understand ? 
  the point is that our law is written to fit another type of society . 
  everyone here agree that changes in polish society througout last 4 years were tremendous . 
  now that society changed - the safety mechanisms left by predescesors are working aggainst those who wish to change it ( law ) . 
  while benefitting those who still protect it . 
  some may argue that we changed for the bad but ** people are not cattle ** and should not be coerced by mechanisms . 
  it will not change over time beacuse judges will still be the same - leading only to growing conflict of interests .
