  in announcing this , president krzysztof szczerski assured that andrzej duda ** `` is open to a substantive discussion on the reform of the judiciary . 
  '' ** the purpose of monday 's meetings - added szczerski - is to allow all parties to present their arguments in this matter . 
  the president will meet with the chairman of the national council of the judiciary . 
  `` according to the press spokesman of the national court of justice judge waldemar \u017burka , judge dariusz zawistowski was invited to a meeting at the presidential palace at 12 o'clock . 
  14 or later at the headquarters of the national council of pomology will be held a press conference after the talks . 
  earlier , it was announced on friday that on monday , 11 . 
  president andrzej duda 's meeting with i president of the supreme court , ma\u0142gorzata gersdorf , will take place . 
  a request for a meeting was sent to the president on friday the first president of the sn . 
  she also called for `` a peaceful and substantive discussion on the shape of justice in poland '' . 
  in a letter published at the supreme court 's website , gersdorf asked duda , `` i would like to respect the office that i have fulfilled . '', 
  `` these dramatic words are directed to you in a dramatic moment for the history of poland , '' she wrote . 
  in the opinion of the first president of the supreme court , the proposed changes to the judiciary - pending the signature of the president changes in the laws of common courts and the national council of judiciary and the new law on the supreme administrative court are unanimously contradictory to the will of the nation expressed in the constitution . 
  judiciary . 
  adoption of the law of the supreme court took place during the protests of the parliamentary and extra-parliamentary opposition . 
  this led to demonstrations on the streets of many cities . 
  the presidential palace . 
  appealed to the president to veto three laws : the national court register , the system of common courts , the law of the supreme court . 
  do n't count on it . 
  po + nowoczesna are deep in merkel and timmermans pockets . 
  they will not risk to anger their masters . 
  once they get to power they will destroy last remnants of soverenity in poland . 
  if he is spineless - he will use veto in fear of protesters . 
  i do n't know what do you want from him ? 
   why would pis need judges consent for that ? 
  do n't they control the legislative part of the government ? 
  ca n't they vote on a new law ? 
  thay can - but it is enough to get 30 parlimentarists ( out of 460 ) to sue the law as `` illegal '' and the judicary decides if it is legal . 
  so basically even if liberals had less than 10 % parliment - with help of liberal judges they could block anything . 
  ( that was the real reason for fight over constitutional court and now sc )  whether you believe it or not , eu has little to no say in the internal governance of any one state . 
  and that is by design . 
  if there is any liberal push it comes from within poland and not from outside . 
  directly - yes . 
  via owned mass media and by voting on rules not in favour to some countries - quite a lot . 
  our talk is the proof . 
  you said - `` i 'm a balkan child . 
  i 'm as far from the west eu as you can possibly be . 
  ** and from where i stand what pis is doing looks like a frenzied power grab while they are still can and not whats best for poland . 
  ** i lived trough fair bit of these power struggles in bulgaria and i know that they are always net negative for the people . '', 
  you got that info from somewhere . 
  someone presented you that picture . 
  probably some media . 
  someone owns that media . 
  ** depending on who owns it - such picture is presented ** . 
  make no mistake - i realize the pis is doing exactly the same . 
  i try to watch both sides `` propaganda tubes '' in poland ( tvp ( pis ) and tvn ( po+n owoczesna ) ) to actually know what is going on . 
  for many of us pis is still `` lesser '' evil . 
   if pis is doing a good job of running the country they would be elected again and continue their work . 
  no matter what eu or anyone else thinks . 
  that 's the good thing about democracy . 
  yep - but there are many ways for eu to throw logs on pis legs ( like quota migrants or deals with russia , or forcing minimal wage to truck drivers - mostly from poland , quite a big income for us - after forced pay increese many companies would go bancrupt ) all that could be used by opposition to swing public in their favour . 
  so yeah eu can easily indirectly support opposition in poland . 
  wow . 
  4 cops carrying her . 
  pervious government would simply shot at her with watercannon or she would get hit with a club . 
  we certainly improved standards of police behavior throughout that last 2 years . 
   why pis not work towards removing such language from the law then ? 
  pis would need judges consent for that  yes . 
  slow and steady . 
  law by law . 
  we are not in vaccum . 
  remember that majority of eu is liberal and is trying to push everyone who opposes into the line . 
  threats of sanctions if some countries to not submit to mainstream are now common . 
  many threats were issued towards poland now ( more than russia got after crimea annexation :-) ) . 
  we would need many calm years to change that system . 
  nobody will give us that time as eu was fine with what was happening untill now . 
  they would apply pressure until government breaks and everything would remain the same . 
  i really do n't know how to argue that . 
  the only solution would be to abolish democracy because people do n't know what is good for them . 
  o.o if people in poland do n't know what is good for them than nobody else does . 
  same for every other country . 
  it looks diffrent from inside than outside . 
  there were people claiming they know what is good for others - stalin , hitler etc. 
  but for some reason nobody liked them . 
  by myself i will say that ibris tends to `` upgrade '' results in favour of liberal opposition . 
  there was a famous situation where they estimated support for nowoczesna ( modern ) for 40 % while all they got was 7,69 . 
  well . 
  maybe this will calm some emotions about `` pis acting aggainst citizens '' . 
  the opposition can not use the controversy related to the pis reform of the judiciary and anti-government protests in poland - according to the latest ibris survey for `` rzeczpospolita '' . 
  wiktor ferefecki in the rzeczpospolita daily comments on the latest poll of support for political parties in poland . 
  jaroslaw kaczynski , losing control of himself in the sejm , the crowds in the streets and the concern of international organizations - the speed and pace of pis 's efforts to push the rebuilding of the supreme court seems to be the ideal topic for the opposition to improve the listing position '' - he estimates . 
  as reported by the daily , compared with the june poll pis strengthened by 3 percentage points . 
  and for the kaczy\u0144ski party wants to vote 37 percent . 
  respondents . 
  the following places are : po - 21 % ( down by 2 percentage points ) , modern - 9 percent . 
  ( increase by 2 percentage points ) , kukiz '15 - 8 percent . 
  ( down 2 percentage points ) , sld - 7 % . 
  and psl - 5 % ** ibris conducted its study on tuesday and wednesday , during the hottest discussions in the sejm ** . 
  on the night of tuesday night jaroslaw kaczynski spoke the famous sentence of the `` canals '' that `` murdered '' his brother - we read . 
   the concept of government system designed to work with only one ideology escapes me . 
  could you give me an example ? 
  very simple . 
  there is such phrase . 
  something `` serves no purpose '' or `` is counterproductive '' or , `` might endanger something '' - that is enough explanation for a judge in poland that does not agree with some actions - to make them illegal - of course he needs to cite certain paragraph and his understandig of it - his beliefs are absolutely crutial for interpretation of the law and also to progress of country . 
  our system was faulty from the beginning but nobody noticed untill now because judges and ruling party were `` in accord '' with west eu . 
  they only started noticing that when the same rule could be used aggainst liberals . 
  now they scream bloddy murder that judges will be politically oriented - ** while they were , all that time ** - only on liberal side . 
  there is no easy way out of this . 
  do you have any less controvertial way to make changes in faulty judicary system whos judges want things to stay as they are ? 
  out of entire europe - in poland it was never illegal to be gay . 
  you might get some bad looks from grandmas at the church but poles are highly individualistic and most keeps to themselves .
