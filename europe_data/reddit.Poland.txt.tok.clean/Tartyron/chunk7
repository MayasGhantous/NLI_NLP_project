  if that was the case pis would have constitutional majority, 
  he is putting that one sided post everywhere . 
  remember - those are all quotes from pis opponents - so basically it is like asking virgin about sex - no real truth could be found there . 
  diversify your sources otherwise you are simply manipulated . 
  the dark side is strong in us . 
  soon we will no longer be apprentice but the master !, 
  and soon , whole galaxy will tremble before the power of the dark side !, 
   the big 3 ( fr , ger , it ) are the current leadership of the eu most of them are liberal ( the kind of liberal poland , turkey , hungary and russia hate so much ) . 
  once they said big five ( fr , ger , it , gb , spa ) later crisis strucked and there were four ( fr , ger , it , gb ) than gb left and there were three ( fr , ger , it ) the italy has elections in february - will there be only two afterwards ? 
  they cant change the law without consent from judicary . 
  it is enough to have 30 parlimentary members ( out of 460 ) to bring any new law to judicary . 
  what you propose is going in circles because judicary with just a few liberal parliment members can block any changes in law ( in poland ), 
  you forgot korwin and other right sided parties . 
  i wonder if psl will manage to next parliment . 
  the recent pool showed 38 % for pis and 19 % for po 2:1 for pis kukiz ( potential pis ally ) - 9 % nowoczesna ( potetntial po ally ) - 8 % and it was not even government survey group ( like cbos ) - it was kantar public . 
  deal with it . 
  pis stays in power . 
  i must really buy that game . 
  you forgot that it was germany that crushed poland together with russia . 
  and it was not germany only that helped us afterwards but entire ue + usa . 
  getting hold of nearly entire our market in the process . 
  plus we got independant from ussr ( not russia - russia returned to its name after collapse of ussr ) plus we never attacked russian soil in over the last 300 years . 
  plus russia can now barely compete with italy in its economic power - not with usa as ussr did . 
  plus russia now has several `` frozen conflicts '' in the process . 
  but other than that - true ;-), 
  yep - but in our case judges take side of liberals - so it is not that they are `` independant '' or `` fair playbook '' - maybe no one can do anything to them but they are dominated by single way of thinking - unlike the rest of society . 
  and because only they decide who joins judicary - it will remain pro-liberal forever given current rules . 
  dosent matter what i like - only dictators oppose the will of majority . 
  using sanctions and threats to force other countries to obey is russia way of thinking . 
  that was a very poor decision . 
  no wonder europe have hicup - using law and force to suppress majority voice ends badly , because such majority tends to grow - with no exeptions to that rule . 
  the authors of the scientific report by the media school in hamburg and the university of leipzig say that the largest german media uncritically supported the angla merkel migration policy between 2015 and 2016 , neglecting its control role . 
  the report , to be published by the otto brenner foundation on monday , reported on thursday the `` die zeit '' . 
  researchers from both institutions analyzed several thousand articles published in die welt , bildung , frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and sueddeutsche zeitung and in regional newspapers from february 2015 to march 2016 . 
  according to the authors , the mainstream media not only supported merkel 's refugee policy , but uncritically assimilated the `` slogans of political elites '' and disseminated the `` euphemistic and persuasive rhetoric '' contained in the concept of `` welcoming culture '' ( willkommenskultur ) . 
  this word has become a `` magical formula , '' which puts moral pressure on citizens to `` serve the samaritan service , '' writes the report , quoted by die zeit . 
  lead researcher michael haller said that the german media industry was in a `` structural and ideological crisis '' . 
  `` a large proportion of journalists have stopped to understand what their role is and have neglected the task of explaining ( the readers ) of the world , '' he said . 
   did n't prevent austria from being sanctioned for having a far-right government years ago . 
  you mean to say that eu can punish someone for electing the government brussels do not want ? 
  wow - even russia pretends to respect democracy to some extent . 
  that puts eu in very poor spotlight . 
  that , plus - many countries fear they would be next . 
  voting for that could cause domino effect in eu . 
  there are many things other countries dissagree with brussel . 
  fear of being treated as is poland now is a strong motivator - ** not ** to vote in favour of suspending voting rights . 
   overall , the original eu negotiatiors have been too soft in accepting former efta members , giving special treatment to now eea members and speeding accession of the former eastern block . 
  the entire geopolitical goal and process of the continent needs a redesign now that is arrogant . 
  who said the east europe must become as the west ? 
  why not other way around ? 
  we never signed for anything like that !, 
  there is a push and pull here . 
  if you want the continent to unite the east must accept some western values and west - some of the estern . 
  otherwise it will not work - ever . 
   i wonder what is going to happen when poland becomes a net contributor . 
  then we will demand more influence over - `` where eu is heading ? '', 
  - because we will be paying for it . 
  there is a saying in poland . 
  - `` i pay , so i demand '' - that is why poles are divided now weather to obey ec or to take independant decisions . 
  if poland becomes net contributor be prepared for real pressure from polish side for changes in eu . 
  for now ec has still some moral advantage - but it is smaller every year . 
  and timmermans realizes that . 
  those are last years where ec can issue threats like that . 
  taking funds from poland would only speed up that process . 
  yep . 
  but in zlotys . 
  make judges in high court be elected directly by citizens ? 
   why is arbitrary decision of who has `` the right ideology '' and who does n't better than a system that judges them on the quality of their conduct and rulings ? 
  because nation can change ideology - and by such - the government . 
  the judical system separated from the rest of nation will be multiplying obstructions - leading to chaos or paralysys of country - still without any consequences . 
  judical system needs to anwser to someone - ** needs to evolve as the rest of society ** - otherwise it is just oligarchy . 
  because we have a chain of events here . 
  if some judges have certain worldview or are corrupted - than who is chosen to join them ? 
  of course only like-minded people . 
  if the judicary is closed system than there is no ability for anyone who disagrees with them to join without their approval . 
  and approving people with differet beliefs would be sucidal for them . 
  that way situtation was the same 28 years ago , is today and will be in another 28 years . 
  change needs to come from outside the system because it is not possible to clear by itself ( last 28 years shown that ) . 
  once again - it is controvertial - but what else ( outside growing accustomed to corruption ) can we do ? 
  and that is why pis rules in poland now . 
   corruption is addressed via laws , reform of institutions enforcing those laws , and then actual enforcement , not wholesale re-arrangement of basic constitutional separations . 
  how do you enforce laws on independand judicary if judicary itself does not enforce laws on itself ( corruption ) ? 
  without changing the law ? 
  ( ec protests aggainst changing it ), 
  i am not saying that this is the best course of action . 
  i am saying that acting in defence of current system will lower respect for ec in poland . 
  if they really want to help ec should propose some way out of it - other way to uphold separation of power and not to allow judges to be unremovable corrupted relics . 
  not just `` do n't change anything '' because people want to change it . 
  and they will anyway . 
  big mistake they take side of corruption . 
  most poles wants changes in judicary and know the current system is corrupted . 
  as much as kaczynski actions are controvertial ( even a lot ) - protecting current system is protecting the corruption ( for most poles ) . 
  it will bring no glory either to ec or to polish opposition ( it is not defence of democracy as some mainstream media try to sell to lemings ) . 
  after that the entusiasm for eu in poland will be significantly lower . 
  then why the delay ? 
  i can assure you that when all settles down in v4 , turkey , italy , greece and gb - we all will be very responsive to he madness that is gong on in france , germany and benelux . 
  we will help them come to their senses . 
  there were plans for such a game . 
  `` you are polish senior . 
  you get 800 zloty ~ 200 euro retirement .
