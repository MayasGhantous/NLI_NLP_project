  oh look , this thread again ...  no . 
  we got used to it . 
  demolishing it and building another one would paralyze center of warsaw for years . 
  last debate about this topic was about 20 years ago . 
  they should n't be called germany anymore , but gereverywhere . 
  somehow prosecutors controlled by pis do n't agree with both of you .

  [ german candidate elected ] ( http://niezalezna.pl/95105-niemiecki-kandydat-zostal-ponownie-przewodniczacym-rady-europejskiej ) , i wish i was kidding , that 's the summary of this title . 
  edit : [ meme about this , niemcy means germany in polish , on polish territory it says `` strategy mastermind '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kwzr2vm.jpg ) . 
  there will be just empty space left , but no poland . 
  poland wo n't into space . 
  poland become space . 
  eli5 what exactly is a lie here and please be more specific than quoting whole paragraph . 
  there wo n't be a single flame anymore when there 's no air left . 
  do you see now ? 
  pure logic . 
   for my life i ca n't understand so many people love of authoritarian right wing parties . 
  in my opinion it 's very simple in poland and it 's included in the post : everyone gets ~ 116 $ monthly for a second and each next child . 
  for some people that 's significant money , since minimal salary in poland is ~ 350 $ . 
   is any of the stuff even illegal ? 
  beating your family is legal in your opinion ? 
  wtf . 
   you whine about dying democracy and you come up with this ? 
  read again points 3 and 10 , carefully this time . 
  will mexico pay for the nuclear shelters as well as for the wall ? 
  wine has already been served in this scenario . 
  also i assume there would be a lot of human fluids in this coca cola , 
  extra ketchup to my ratatouille ? 
  yes , please !, 
  i think adding sugar to dry wine in a restaurant would top your ketchup ... 
  i 've seen people doing this in poland ( not in restaurants of course ) . 
  so i 'm trying to learn something here . 
  i need this horrible french wine of yours with ice cubes s ` il te pla\u00eet ! '', 
  how am i doing ? 
  at least you 're extra triggered among your others countrymen . 
  so it still worked , like a charm . 
  how do you feel about [ this meme ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j21qx9n.jpg ) ? 
  explanation for others : how do you write postcommunism ? 
  together razem translates to `` together '' . 
  we have not so small vietnamese community mainly in warsaw and there never was any significant problem with them . 
  also i do n't think they did made poland homogeneous , non existent social for non working foreigners did it . 
   hundreds of people showing up shows great solidarity . 
  and they should stopped there , with showing up , lightning candles and shout slogans . 
  peaceful protest can send the message as well . 
  otherwise today they throw stones at windows , tomorrow at people , would you like this kind of sending message ? 
  people stoning each other on the streets ? 
  well i would n't want it in poland . 
  vandalism is necessary ? 
  yeah , these racist windows must be broken . 
  they were waiting for backups , you can see on the photos in the article , that they went into action later . 
  the day after ( today ) . 
  [ video of people cheering vandals ... 
  wtf . 
  ] ( https://streamable.com/4umv6 ) edit : damn , i just wish people in my country would n't be happy about destruction . 
  i see the immigration crisis and personally i 'm advocate of [ australian solution ] ( http://pakistan.embassy.gov.au/files/islm/140925finaladvert-noway.jpg ) and in my opinion it will come to that sooner or later , because now europe gets only the richest immigrants and poor refugees must live in [ camps like this ] ( http://tarekmostafa.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/zaatari1.jpg ) . 
  but i do n't like seeing people throwing stones at windows , because i 'm afraid what will be next . 
  i agree that chalk drawings were stupid , i agree that people should be mad and gather . 
  but not riots . 
  already done .
