  still idiots-like argument and none real one , you 're embarrassing yourself . 
   your argumentation is unbelievably stupid and naive said no wise human ever , unless he could prove it . 
  it got boring after reading too much , but see the best book on lubimyczytac and read it , you will laugh your ass off , 
   uh yeah , how to make farm animals ' lives less shit , throw some balls in . 
  tragic/funny thing is that farm animals living in eu with shelter , food and water , are living in better conditions than hundreds of millions of people on earth without access to fresh water , and yet it looks like you care more about these animals fate . 
  you 're a vegan/vegetarian ? 
  slim chances you wo n't switch back to eating meat : http://www.inquisitr.com/1663004/84-percent-of-vegetarians-become-meat-eaters-again-study-finds/, 
   you do n't really believe that they have a good life do you ? 
  there are people who are never happy and believe in utopia , do you ? 
  they tried to make life of farm animals less miserable and you still complain . 
  wild animals have a good life and i 'm pretty sure that you do n't like that people hunt either . 
   that 's quite delusional , and all those regulations are easy to circumvent . 
  delusional is thinking that inspectors ca n't count animals and ca n't see balls in crofts . 
   but pigs raised on a small farm is the lesser evil compared to big factory farming european union regulates that , every animal must have at least x meters of space , they must have toys ( balls ) , cows must have special electric brushes , things are n't that bad as before and for sure not as bad as in usa . 
  that is true , i wrote in past tense . 
  name meaning siren/mermaid . 
  come on , you had your army in poland the whole time . 
  you would n't be wrong claiming that your provocation is successful , not bad trolling at all , 
   poor pigs these pigs were living in better conditions than many people on earth . 
  [ jakub w\u0119drowycz ] ( https://coolturalnie.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wedrowycz.jpg ), 
  poland was under cccp regime . 
  it 's just funny , warm photo . 
  [ another photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3qem1yc.png ) . 
  because poland is n't as rich as other western countries . 
  people , especially younger , wants that change now . 
  also he did n't do any significant reform pro-people like in healthcare or education . 
  we do n't know current opinions after yesterday yet . 
  pis got lucky that ~ 15 % of votes were parties that did n't manage to get into parliament . 
  even with the same support as previously , they may not get so lucky next time . 
   i ca n't even find a job , because i live in a small city and everyone knows i 'm against church gtfo with stupid excuses . 
  atheist became major of city wadowice . 
  for non poles : wadowice is the city , where pope john paul 2 was born . 
  only 3 years left !, 
  pole posted this here and he knew exactly what he was doing . 
  kashubian means citizen of kaszuby , region of poland . 
  i pointed it out just a moment ago , when this thread is already 2 hours old . 
  interesting thing for me is that no pole before me pointed this out sooner , despite writing comments here , and many non-poles argue if the fake title is correct or not . 
  quote in the title here is a blunt lie . 
  newspaper says : `` citizens of warsaw went through the same thing as citizens of aleppo today . 
  lets not leave syrians without help '' . 
  mods here removed my posts for editorialization of a title . 
  this happened here as well . 
   nah , not really . 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa is somehow considered a traitor now . 
  and you do n't consider that to be typical polish thing ? 
  i have n't noticed that too by myself , i have when some foreigner laughed about it . 
  i mentioned abbreviation of party name in polish , because pis was major opposition back then ( now they rule ) , and ruling party at the time ( now major opposition ) abbreviation is : po . 
  pis and po . 
  foreigner knowing english in poland give us hard time about it often . 
  they have conspiracy theory that the crash was n't accident and a lot of people believe that putin is behind the whole thing . 
  and wladimir putin decided to call them live on national tv . 
  another thing is that this balding crazy bastard on the left said to the journalist later , that internet in polish parliament was hacked ... :d, 
  unfortunate photo . 
  according to fact that we got out of the [ iron curtain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_curtain ) 23 years ago , we 're doing fine . 
  of course we 're dealing many problems , but you can see change everywhere , even in smaller towns . 
  new roads , new buildings , new polish companies . 
  the next 2-3 years may be crucial for our economy , because our government has to deal with big budget deficit . 
  from average people point of view , minimal wage grows , average salary as well , and it overtake raise of prices . 
  i do n't see poland we 'll be leading european economy in foreseeable future , but seeing past 23 years we made huge advance in every aspect . 
  i have n't seen it here yet . 
  this is proposal of vladimir zhirinovsky , vice-chairman of the state duma . 
  w\u0119gry means hungary : edit : more accurate map : http://i.imgur.com/sr1hwza.jpg ~ ~ blue color is for ukrainians , yellow is russia . ~ ~ ~ ~ http://i.imgur.com/aolf5fs.jpg~~,

  if anyone wants to help in translation ( my engrish bad engrish ) , feel free , i 'll edit this . 
  about anna grodzka - first openly transgender ( m to f ) member of parliament in poland `` his place is in a circus , among woman with beard and black man with 20 inch ... '' source : http://youtu.be/zcdmz6d5sja?t=4m51s *** jkm : `` amount of little-homo * people is up to 1.5 % '' \\* [ no better idea how to translate this ] interlocutor : `` who ? '', 
  jkm : `` little-homos . '', 
  interlocutor `` what does it mean ? '', 
  jkm : `` it 's a tender name ... '' interlocutor : `` for ? '', 
  jkm : `` i do n't use this g word , because it reminds me of shit . '', 
  ( he 's talking about gay word , shit in polish is g\u00f3wno . ), 
  http://youtu.be/zcdmz6d5sja?t=14m26s side note here - good luck translators in eu parliament when he will be using this little-homo word , it 's hardly translatable and he invented it i guess , anyway i 've never heard it before . 
  *** `` there 's no difference , from a sexuality point of view , between sexual intercourse between two little homos and intercourse of anyone with a hole in a fence . '', 
  http://youtu.be/zcdmz6d5sja?t=14m42s *** `` there 's no proof that hitler knew about holocaust '' http://youtu.be/rgoz9rdcnf8?t=17m27s *** reporter : `` do you think women want to be raped ? '', 
  jkm : `` what does it mean : raped . 
  women always pretend to resist . 
  that 's normal . '', 
  ( look at face of the guy on the left when he says it : http://youtu.be/rgoz9rdcnf8?t=4m20s ) reporter : `` so what is a rape ? '', 
  jkm : `` overcoming resistance ... you should know when you can do it and when you ca n't . '', 
  http://youtu.be/rgoz9rdcnf8?t=4m13s *** jkm : `` no one knows why when you tell that women are statistically shorter and lighter than a men , everything is fine . 
  but when you tell ... 
  if you get one random man and woman , there 's 60 % chance he 's more intelligent than her because of this small difference ... '' reporter : `` where do you get that data ? '', 
  jkm : `` it 's common known fact based on scientific studies . '', 
  http://youtu.be/pspvvxxshi4?t=11m42s *** `` of course democracy is stupid , there 's more stupid people than smart ones . '', 
  http://youtu.be/pspvvxxshi4?t=19m27s side note : jkm is monarchist . 
  similar : democracy means that if this man , you miss and i will be trapped on an island , we having a majority of votes will decide that you have to sleep with us . 
  that 's the democracy . 
  and with 2/3 votes we can even put that in the constitution . 
  http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/janusz_korwin-mikke *** about disabled people . 
  jkm : `` we ca n't have hitlers rules . 
  hitler made paralympics . '', 
  http://youtu.be/pspvvxxshi4?t=23m20s also he said somewhere that woman with a pimple on her face and disabled person should stay at home . 
  `` this is not about the aesthetics : there is a rule in a society : `` whoever you deal with , makes you become them '' , therefore watching the efforts of para-athletes can bring the temporary mobility disorder . 
  if we want humanity to develop , the television should show us people who are healthy , beautiful , strong , honest and wise - not perverts , murderers , weaklings , losers , idiots or invalids . '', 
  http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/janusz_korwin-mikke *** http://i.imgur.com/1xhv9oc.jpg he claims most of the politicians in parliaments in europe are socialists , and want to `` destroy this brothel '' , meaning european parliament . 
  *** `` a woman gets saturated with the views of the man she sleeps with . 
  after all ( nature or god - no point to argue ) did not construct men so that hundreds of thousands of sperm cells would be wasted ; they penetrate the body of a woman and remake it in the image and likeness of the man she belongs to . '', 
  http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/janusz_korwin-mikke *** his party got a bit over 7 % in the elections , based on results it 's a fourth political force in poland . 
  so get ready to hear more of this and remember : this is not how every pole thinks .
