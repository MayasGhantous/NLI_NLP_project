  but i may be wrong . 
  how about yellow ? 
  i wrote it in description . 
  you 've seen nothing . 
  what about : chrzaszcz - real common used word , means beetle . 
  virtually unspeakable to foreigners . 
  ** poland ** * ukraine * ukraine * ukraine the situation in ukraine - their president dropped agreement of taking first step to be in european union causing people to riot . 
  it 's a big thing for poles , because we 're the big part of east border of eu and would like to have another neighbor being in eu . 
   rather good looking women ( unfortunately , the same thing can not be said about the men ... ) you do n't like the [ polish plumber ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=polish+plumber&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=gxu&amp;rls=org.mozilla:pl:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=yaf3uegxcijitqaxzyhgaw&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1127&amp;bih=743 ) ? 
   love the word ` kurwa ' . 
  yes , indeed  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcyo7vcynio, 
  it depends on the region . 
  i 'm from silesia , which was partly german before wwii . 
  now many people here have families in germany and in general germans are liked here . 
  there are plenty of polish-germans visiting here around holidays ( christmas and easter ) , you can see plenty of cars with german plates everywhere at these times . 
  also when we lost in euro , many people cheered on germans . 
   we like czech , but to some people all of the czech language is funny . 
  like it 's all diminutives . 
  i heard that the czechs are n't that amused . 
  they also tend to like us less :( . 
  i live like 20 km from border with czech and i 've been dozens of times there if not hundreds ( but mainly near the border ) . 
  i felt like they do n't like us maybe twice and it was when we got too loud . 
  otherwise they welcome us well . 
  you do n't even have to try to talk their language `` dobri den '' , you just speak polish in shops , pubs and restaurants near the border and they just get it . 
  also you can pay with polish zloty in many places . 
  daaaamn this beer in the pubs there !, 
   there were times when you could drink couple of beers in restaurant and order so much food that you could n't eat it and pay like 25-30 pln . 
  it lasted for like 2 years , then exchange rate of czech korona changed , but in this time i was going there like every week . 
  there 's this restaurant just next to chalupki town ( but you do n't cross the border in main crossing but the other ) on a hill in small castle ( now there 's a golf club next to it ) , great food : http://www.restauracezamecek.cz/ ( photos on home page is a slide show ) . 
   then , suddenly when they come to a western country , they start to work and take care of themselves . 
  and it 's always said that communism is to blame . 
  do n't really know how much of that is true . 
  this type of poles they just want to work , but have lack of possibilities or shitty payment here . 
  i find many hardworking poles here in poland now . 
  there 's even saying about cars in deutsch i do n't remember how it went but translated was like : `` just have been stolen ? 
  already in polen '' . 
  this way  http://i.imgur.com/wtzgw1w.jpg it 's the florianska street in cracow , where it 's forbidden to place own banners etc , each advertisement must be accepted by city architect council . 
  otherwise it would look probably more like this : http://i.imgur.com/7yggles.jpg so i was often on florianska street and never had a problem to find monopolowy , 
  we took hundreds of thousands ukrainian immigrants already : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society, 
   if the euro is so great then convincing the general public of the truth will be no problem , right ? 
  not really . 
  even before greek crisis many average poles with little economic knowledge had opinion that `` when $ come everything will become more expensive '' . 
  despite proofs that it 's or not true or almost unnoticeable . 
  i was pro $ at the time , but not now . 
  from what i know , every country in euro zone participates in greek debts , even much poorer countries like latvia . 
   most people i know , other than my muslim mates , disagree with taking refugees in in the tens of thousands . 
  do n't you already have thousands immigrants there already that came through calais ? 
  i read it wrong , i thought that he wrote to turn back their ships . 
  and that 's exactly what australia is doing for a long time . 
  result : no casualties of immigrants . 
  edit : i read it wrong . 
  what i mean is australia turns back ships with immigrants . 
  like china ? 
  please . 
  wow , i was banned for months for posting something unrelated with immigrants . 
  after seeing your comment i realized i 'm unbanned now . 
  it looks like there had to be some amnesty . 
  i remember driving through poland - germany border before access to eu . 
  border with a lot of custom officers . 
  i had a rather shitty car those days so i was often taken to the side and car was searched . 
  the road to the border on polish side looked pretty much [ like this ] ( http://www.lublin112.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/083.jpg ) . 
  and then after border there was normal highway , that looked for me like luxury . 
  then i remember when i had a highway joint opened less than 10 km from my house in poland . 
  and now i can go on this highway from my house to germany without border control . 
  we had a real civilizational leap after joining ue . 
  it saddens me that more and more poles , especially young , despises ue and wants now all the perks western countries have like salaries and healthcare . 
  they do n't know that you ca n't convert a country from economical ruin to one of the richest countries in 25 years . 
  we 're getting there . 
  and higher salaries are waiting in uk or germany , you just need to know language on a basic level and there you go , you can earn there . 
  i do n't get this complaint logic . 
  it 's past . 
  we may hated you like 20 years ago when you were more communist and made shittiest quality products . 
  now you 're rich ( in cities ) and innovative and in general praised in poland . 
  we also have here a lot of chinese restaurants usually with great food . 
  does this article really say that there 's a ban on demonstrations in defense of this satiric person ? 
  he 's saying basically this , start @ 12 : https://youtu.be/t2icmoyp8gs?t=12s, 
   how completely disgusting it is for an average person to see a group of people calling for foreign intervention against their own country because of a domestic issue . 
  exactly this group of people was pis when they were opposition , you forgot that , did n't you . 
  the reasons may be that poland was one of the first countries that joined usa attack on iraq . 
  also our special forces lend usa a place for `` do n't ask what we will do there '' and turned out they were torturing suspects there . 
  am i missing something here or you 've never heard of `` lewatywa '' ? 
  bars in amsterdam have toilets , that 's why borrowing penis pipe from bartender is supposed to be funny . 
  here is 10 different translations of `` you one ugly motherfucker '' in polish : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu8srzydpas, 
   die hard \u2192 szklana pu\u0142apka \u2192 trap made of glass or just glass trap . 
  funny thing is that translators did n't foresee sequels coming and all of the sequels had names like `` glass trap 2 '' and so on , despite the movies had anything to do with glass . 
  edit :  robocop \u2192 superglina/terminator/elektroniczy morderca \u2192 supercop/terminator/the electronic murderer you mixed two movies . 
  robocop was titled superglina/supercop , and the first terminator movie was titled as elektroniczny morderca/the electronic murderer . 
  two different films . 
   just `` kac '' does n't sound good . 
  maybe , but it literally means hangover . 
   the 1997 central european flood or the 1997 oder flood of the oder river and its tributaries in july 1997 affected poland , germany , and the czech republic , taking the lives of about 100 people ( in the czech republic and poland ) and causing material damages estimated at $ 4.5 billion ( 3.8 billion euros in the czech republic and poland and 330 million euros in germany ) . 
  the flooding began in the czech republic , then spread to poland and germany . 
  in poland , where it was one of the most disastrous floods in the history of that country , it was named the millennium flood ( pow\u00f3d\u017a tysi\u0105clecia ) . 
  the term was also used in germany ( jahrtausendflut ) . 
  the flood has also been referred to as the great flood of 1997 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_central_european_flood, 
   7,1 % in poland is straight bullshit , in reality it 's around 12 % , 13 % . 
  in reality it 's below 5 % in cities like poznan or warsaw . 
  how much money a refugee gets in germany ? 
  does they get anything before they 're accepted as refugees ? 
  and when refugee status is granted , lets say a refugee can bring his wife and 2 kids to germany , how much do they get ?
