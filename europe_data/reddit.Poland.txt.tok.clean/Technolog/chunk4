  some funny context : pro-opposition paper said there were 200 thousand protesters , pro-government media said amount of protesters was about 10 thousands . 
   source in polish : http://pikio.pl/swietne-relacje-mediow-10-000-50-000-100-000-200-000/ although biggest polish news network , that by pro-government people is associated with opposition , said 50 thousand , so it looks like at least they did n't try to manipulate the number . 
  in the meantime in 4 other polls : http://i.imgur.com/zadc2an.jpg edit : results of tns are in red circles . 
  except for acta when downloading illegal movies was in danger , hundred of thousands protested on the streets nation wide and it was all over reddit as well .

  some do n't , and those who do argue that `` if 9 of 10 of my neighbors burn trashes , there would be no difference if i stop '' . 
  i know there 's no logic in it . 
  not only . 
  their fathers did it , grandfathers the same . 
  for years ecology was ignored . 
  but yes , there are still a lot of poor people , especially in villages and small towns . 
  plenty of people do this , also because otherwise they would have to pay for the trash to be taken , so they burn everything what they can . 
  also many people store trash that can be burned in ceiling whole year , that 's why autumn is the worst , they burn trashes from whole year . 
  content for those who are behind paywall : battle between polish government and top court escalates critics say law and justice party is dismantling checks and balances necessary in a democracy warsaw -- a constitutional crisis in poland escalated friday as the government opened a new line in its continuing battle with the country 's top court , part of a volatile start for the country 's populist new leadership . 
  the law and justice party won an outright majority in the lower house of poland 's parliament in october , riding a wave of discontent with the previous government and promising sweeping changes it said would improve living standards . 
  soon after taking power last month , it took steps to cancel previous appointments of judges to the constitutional tribunal , which rules on all legislation , and replace them with its own nominees , arguing that the body is filled with opponents who are biased against it . 
  that has led to a series of tit-for-tat moves that have polarized the country and raised accusations of government overreach . 
  the battle is offering fuel to critics who say the new government is dismantling checks and balances necessary in a democracy . 
  on friday , the spat descended into confusion , as an official said the government would n't publish the ruling recognizing the selection of judges in the previous term of parliament as lawful , denying the court decision official status . 
  a few hours later , another official said it would be published eventually , though he did n't clarify when . 
  normally , rulings are supposed to be published immediately , though it can take up to two weeks . 
  the opposition has called for rallies over the weekend to protest what it says is the party 's heavy-handed approach . 
  law and justice leader , jaroslaw kaczynski , has expressed admiration for hungary 's forceful prime minister , viktor orban , who has since 2010 given his country a new constitution and sidelined political opponents . 
  `` what law and justice is doing is a war on the state of law , '' said tomasz siemoniak , one of the leaders of the opposition civic platform , which was voted out of government after eight years in power . 
  the ruling camp has denied it is acting illegally , accusing the court of taking action aimed at tying the government 's hands . 
  each side has cited various laws backing its actions . 
  the law and justice party ran on an agenda of deep change , a platform that appealed to many voters who feel they have n't received the benefits of poland 's membership in the european union . 
  its plans include new child care benefits financed with taxes on banks and supermarkets . 
  it wants to shake up the judiciary , which it sees as inept . 
  it also plans to force state-run television to air less commercial programming and to fire about 1,600 midlevel public servants in the beginning of next year . 
  chief executives of many state-controlled companies have been offering their resignations since the new government took over . 
  the tough line has divided poles and earned the country , touchy about its image abroad , bad press in some foreign outlets , including in neighboring germany . 
  the first weeks in power have also included mixed messages on policy . 
  following the nov. 13 terror attacks in paris , a cabinet minister said poland would renege on the previous government 's commitment to take in thousands of refugees under an eu plan to share the burden more evenly across the bloc . 
  soon after , he backtracked . 
  prime minister beata szydlo said poland would respect its international obligations , even if it wants the eu migrant plan revisited . 
  a deputy defense minister this month said poland , nervous about its increasingly aggressive neighbor russia , was considering asking to borrow u.s. nuclear weapons under a north atlantic treaty organization program . 
  the ministry promptly denied it is working to take part in nato 's nuclear sharing . 
  we got used to it . 
  destroying it and building there something different would make already jammed city center almost unusable for many years . 
  warsaw has bigger concerns like expanding very small subway . 
  warsaw was rebuild after war , people from around the country were coming to help .

  many refugees have a miserable education , only ten percent are university graduates . 
  this has been found the formation economist ludger w\u00f6\u00dfmann . 
  die zeit : mr. w\u00f6\u00dfmann , federal education minister wanka says education is the key to a successful integration of refugees . 
  so far , so right ? 
  ludger w\u00f6\u00dfmann : right , but therein lies the challenge . 
  because many refugees a sufficient level of education is present in order to build on it . 
  time : how do you know that ? 
  to date , no one can say exactly what knowledge , the people who come to us bring . 
  w\u00f6\u00dfmann : in fact , it is argued much with unproven conjectures . 
  that however does not mean , conversely , that we have no data . 
  we just compared the education in a total of 81 countries together only for the oecd , among them countries like syria or albania , from which currently many refugees originate . 
  taking the results of the international student assessments pisa and timss of 2011 - so for now 18-year-olds - based on a shattering picture emerges : in syria , provide 65 percent of students do not make the leap beyond what the oecd defines as basic skills . 
  in albania , the rate stands at 59 percent - compared with 16 percent in germany . 
  time : what does that mean ? 
  w\u00f6\u00dfmann : that is , can that two-thirds of students in syria read and write is very limited , that it can only solve simple arithmetic problems . 
  and that means that these students , even if they have learned german in germany , hardly able to follow the school life . 
  time : how can that be ? 
  just as the syrians are still relatively well formed !,

  another source in english : http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/10/21/slovakia-amends-constitution-to-ban-exports-drinking-mineral-water-in-pipelines/ it does n't include company name though and says that it 's about hungarian company as well . 
  exactly . 
  and why not doing this using laws they have like ban on calling for violence ? 
  i bet each organization that has fundamentalist saying `` kill other people '' is on target , why exclude muslim organizations doing it ? 
  germans avoiding executing their own laws and calling other countries to do it for them is like four year olds asking mom for help . 
  except that germany is grown up nation . 
  i bet that every christian in germany who would say in public `` kill everyone who is non christian '' would be arrested pretty quickly . 
  so russia issued a sanctions against , among others , polish apples . 
  farmers here had some problems , prices dropped , but nothing really bad happened in a long run . 
  but why they imported apples from poland in the first place ? 
  a lot of russia has the same climate as poland , you do n't have to subsidize apples , they just grow on trees . 
  am i missing something or this country is so messed up that they ca n't even organize orchard ? 
  [ i 'm going to hell for this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5rkrnui.jpg ), 
  ukraine did n't cut off the power just like that , power lines ( pylons ) were blown up by some radicals . 
  l is for legia , one of main soccer team in warsaw . 
  so this guy is typical `` kibol '' , a person who likes to get into fights against fans of other teams . 
  it 's popular that after match they do `` ustawka '' so number of people from each group sets up a distant place , they get there and try to beat up the other group : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nymiywppql4 also sometimes these people ( not specifically from legia ) have everyday smaller fights , they burn cars of opposite team fans and there were separated incidents of literally cuttings hands off using machetes . 
  many of them are uneducated , doing shady things or even being criminals . 
  all of them calls themselves patriots and catholics . 
  pure fun ... 
  year 2030 . 
  two german policemen stops a car . 
  `` papers please . '', 
  driver passes papers . 
  `` look ahmed , what a strange last name : m\u00fcller . '', 
  you 're forgetting that poland was already erased from map 3 times by germany ( prussia ) , russia ( and austria ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland unimaginable now ? 
  perhaps . 
  although no one imagined 2 years ago that there will be regular war in our neighbor country ( ukraine ) so there 's that . 
  now he ca n't leave bulgaria , is facing at least 30 000 $ fine and he was drunk . 
  but what they will do in a year or two if they cut all the forests ? 
  and what with the wood/paper industry ? 
  also transport of wood from forests to cities by trucks will be much more expensive than coal from russia by trains . 
  they must find different solution . 
   and the coal from poland ? 
  even poland imports coal from russia and - you wo n't guess - from australia .
