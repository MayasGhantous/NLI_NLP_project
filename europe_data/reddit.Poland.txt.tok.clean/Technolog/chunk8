  but we do n't , we do a lot of delicious desserts , also because of many types of flour . 
  so as i said , it 's different cuisine , not better or worse . 
   you do realize this means lower wages for you and your countrymen ? 
  it 's not that simple . 
  having cheap labor means faster economic growth . 
  also it forces many people to be more educated and wanted on job market . 
  this year poland has lowest unemployment rate since we reclaimed our freedom 26 years ago . 
   it 's quite a satisfying feeling that we are a target for immigration . 
  true , but it happens only because ukrainians and belorussians can legally get a work visa and a job in poland much easier than in any other eu country . 
  otherwise most of them would prefer working in uk or germany ( some would stay because polish is similar to their languages ) . 
  okay here we go . 
  we have a lot types of flour depends on amount of ash . 
  we use different types to make different dishes . 
  from wiki :  in the united states and the united kingdom , no numbered standardized flour types are defined , and the ash mass is only rarely given on the label by flour manufacturers . 
   polish flour type numbers , as is the case in germany , indicate the amount of ash in 100 g of the dry mass of the flour . 
  standard wheat flours ( defined by the pkn in pn-a-74022 :2003 ) range from type 450 to 2000 . 
  in poland there are 8 types of wheat flour and 5 types of rye flour . 
  polish recipes usually give you the exact type of flour to use . 
  different flour types not only tastes differently , but also `` behaves '' differently . 
  for example in many polish cakes when you use wrong type of flour , the cake will get bad ( slack-baked ) . 
  australia had identical problem . 
  and for years not a single immigrant drowned . 
  but before that , some tough decisions needs to be made . 
  and they will be made sooner or later , so why later ? 
  in countries with immigration problem amount of prisoners has also increased recently , does that mean criminals should n't be jailed anymore ? 
  to be honest i do n't care since new cars are fully equipped and [ this set of equipment ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h28vqe9.jpg ) costs like a $ 20 . 
  it 's mandatory to have it in a car in most european countries . 
  i dug in a bit for this and in general eu law says that you cars equipment should meet requirements of the country of registration of the car . 
  but when you 'll get stopped by the police , they may not follow this rule , so they may write you a ticket and from what i read it may happen in other european countries too . 
  new cars have all the equipment , you need to buy this for older cars , but it 's pretty cheap , [ set like this ] ( http://allepomocnik-hosting.gcsoft.pl/users/registered_s2/motosezam/003m2_gasnica_gasnica_apteczka_trojkat_trojkat_kamizelka_zestaw_foto.jpg ) costs like $ 15 . 
  in the top left you see bag for folded triangle , there 's also mount for extinguisher . 
  on the pics you see 3 aid kits , mandatory is obviously only one , this seller just lets you pick color . 
  bottom left is folded vest , also mandatory in many european countries . 
  to be honest i do n't even know if aid kit and vest are mandatory in poland , i know they 're mandatory in other eu countries , so i have all of it . 
  yes . 
  it looks [ like this ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/nti7mda_/477806b2feb54e15257c15daf20c2f52.jpg ) . 
  for example in poland , fire extinguisher is mandatory as well in every car . 
  `` ordnung muss sein '' germans deserve some love too in this case .

  it 's not multiculturalism per se that is failing , it 's this model of accepting richest refugees who could pay the smugglers , when [ hundreds of thousands of them live in camps like this one in jordan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/an_aerial_view_of_the_za%27atri_refugee_camp.jpg/1280px-an_aerial_view_of_the_za%27atri_refugee_camp.jpg ) . 
  i assume you know poland is now refugee unfriendly , to say the least . 
  but you may not know , that we have here thousands of arabs , probably including many muslims , living in poland for years . 
  even in smaller cities they open their kebabs and try to work for a living . 
  and they succeed , kebab is pretty popular fast food in poland now . 
  you do n't have a driving license , yet do you  the difference between expressway ( 120 ) and highway ( 140 ) is that expressway meets lower standards . 
  the shoulder ( emergency lane ) may be tighter , corners may be tighter , smaller divider . 
   the german sign is also a bit confusing . 
  is 130 a `` recommended '' speed or something ? 
  yes . 
  when there 's no speed limit sign on a highway in germany you can go as fast as you want . 
  [ polish vs german border sign for drivers ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/b2/dc/be/z12508338q,polski-znak-drogowy-i-niemiecki.jpg ) [ close up of polish one ] ( http://drogipubliczne.eu/images/znak%20d-39a.jpg ), 
  in my opinion the thing is that you spend the 500 $ on the richest people who had money to pay for smugglers . 
  less fortunate live in [ camp like this in jordan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/an_aerial_view_of_the_za%27atri_refugee_camp.jpg/1280px-an_aerial_view_of_the_za%27atri_refugee_camp.jpg ) and they need food and medical care too and it 's much cheaper to help them there . 
  yes , the 500 $ would be back mostly in your economy ( except of some imported goods ) , but in the bigger picture people in camp like above should be helped too . 
   it is a flat out lie that this is about the best way to `` help people in need '' you will like this video if you did n't see it already : [ immigration , world poverty and gumballs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ), 
   see , it does n't get much publicity , but things have actually changed for girls . 
  this video got some publicity in poland : [ migrants sexually harass german school girls - mayor dismisses grandfather : `` do n't provoke them '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdssjq-fvou ) . 
  did n't it go viral in germany ? 
  i assume there are a lot of germans thinking like the mayor , right ? 
  i 'm not trying to be a douche here , but it looks really sad . 
  shit . 
  assuming some of muslims are grossed out of pigs , feces would be better example . 
   they just do n't eat 'em is all . 
  that 's not all , many of them think it 's a dirty animal and feel dirty after any contact with it . 
  there was number of incidents when someone throw pigs meat or blood on mosques and muslims were very offended . 
   these coins would be usable to buy drugs , but not much else . 
  in my opinion you 're mistaken . 
  there will be created services outside of eu where you will send your bitcoins and they will send them back for a fee using western union or something . 
  i think my english failed above , sorry . 
  what i meant was that if there will be a terrorist attack during the event , this may lead to much more serious situation and racist incidents in poland and they 're already serious , there was about 5 beatings of foreigners last 12 months because of racism and it did n't happen as often before immigration crisis . 
  thanks / u/nuntius _ mortis for trying to understand my bad wording . 
  so what ? 
  there 's about one million of refugees and much more muslims and somehow you do n't hear about racist attacks on them . 
  i would say eurosceptic like eu needs to change and they wo n't get immigrants , not like they want leave . 
  i does , also the explosives must be somewhere . 
  i think that polish authorities are wondering now how to extract the information from this person . 
  and i do n't think they consider legal methods only . 
  poland is a country where more than 90 % of people declare themselves as catholics , the rage if any terrorist attack would happen when pope visits would be enormous . 
  what a clusterfuck . 
  in poland already happened number of beating of people of other nationalities already . 
  if terrorist attack will happen on world youth day , every single darker skinned foreigner living in poland will be in real danger . 
  i have no words . 
  to be honest there was no attack during the euro . 
  it looks like they 're pretty efficient if they really want to prevent an terrorist attack . 
  thanks . 
  but i do n't get it why it could n't be slice of life category . 
  you accept photos of cities , why not woman clearly europe related ? 
  is it because of the camel toe and being nsfw ? 
  it was my way to give you some joy in these times and guess what - it has been removed . 
  before euro 2012 bbc made document about poles being racists suggesting , that non caucasian peoples health and even life may be in danger . 
  reality ? 
  not a single serious accident . 
  we do n't . 
  the ruling party that this weekly supports has about 40 % in polls and this number is decreasing . 
  one may argue it 's a lot , but it means that 60 % of poles are against . 
  also it 's not that bad knowing , that about 90 % of poles declare themselves as catholics , and church in poland is straight anti-gay , contrary to the pope . 
  the guy on the left is known catholic publicist who said a lot of times that current pope is wrong , so there you go , i would say he 's hyper-hypocrite and most poles know it . 
   poe 's law is an internet adage which states that , without a clear indicator of the author 's intent , parodies of extreme views will be mistaken by some readers or viewers for sincere expressions of the parodied views . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law not a joke , here 's the cover on their official website : http://dorzeczy.pl/_i/thumb/500_695_r/1/37f1347de369ba570c18e0d9b7e9a341.jpg but this is far right weekly , not that popular . 
  coal only would not be so bad .
