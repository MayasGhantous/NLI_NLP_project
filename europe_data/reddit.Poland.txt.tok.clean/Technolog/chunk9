  there 's `` tradition '' here that even not poor people burn their trashes in coal furnaces . 
  you can feel it in the air when autumn comes :( they burn everything they can except for things ca n't be burned like glass and metal :( also many people store their trashes ( except for these that smell like food trash ) in their basements whole year to burn it in autumn or winter . 
  you ca n't imagine how bad it gets some days here . 
  i live near \u2611 border . 
  their food is nice , but their beer in pubs is really great !,

  are there any polls about this in czechia ? 
  for example in poland recent poll says 74 % of us are pro eu . 
   and we trust a news-site controled by the current polish government that is widly seen as rather fashist exactly why ? 
  we do n't in general , but in this case they would need to fabricate this document . 
  it 's pretty simple to confirm existence or non-existence of the document , because someone will say something eventually . 
  also not trusting this agency does n't imply that they 're so crazy to fabricate document like this . 
  i honestly think they are n't but if they did , the consequences would be enormous , including international scandal . 
   there are only so many refugees we 'll take , and instead of using people smugglers to select them , we select them from un refugee camps . 
  europe could take the same measurements and then take real war refugees from [ camp like this in lebanon ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/an_aerial_view_of_the_za'atri_refugee_camp.jpg ) . 
  you 're good if you have skills and/or experience , but minimal wage in poland is about 300 $ . 
  this amount lets you survive , but if you wo n't get education or specialistic skills , you have no perspectives at all . 
  on the other hand living in similar conditions like renting a room in smaller cities of uk for minimal wage there , you can save $ 300 monthly . 
  and to be honest most of poles in uk are from smaller cities where is no business . 
  when they want to migrate to other city , uk is better choice than large city in poland to start from scratch . 
  emigration from bigger cities is marginal , because there are perspectives there . 
   oh , and we have n't even begun to talk about automation , it is reaching ever lower in the manufacturing value chain . 
  and we have n't begun to talk about growing desserts in africa , what means less land for cultivation .

  true . 
  one bomb or machine gun attack in crowds around stadiums will result in matches without audience at all . 
  second in outdoor screen place and the result will be that fans will be watching empty stadiums at homes . 
  i really hope it wo n't happen but it 's so easy for terrorist to attack this event . 
   pretending that we wo n't see a massive loss of jobs in the next decades . 
  mechanizing farming took tens of millions of jobs in western countries . 
  mechanizing making processed food products as well . 
  cheap production in china made huge areas of economy in above countries simply disappear . 
  if this scenario would be plausible it would already be happening . 
  it wo n't happen over night so people will adapt to the new situation . 
  [ image here ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/16/053/cl6/fih6365f0_kefirer.jpg ) kefir with a portrait of hitler goes to the czech shops . 
  kef\u00edrer arouses emotions initially it looked like a joke from the czech soda . 
  as an innocent prank recently created fictitious brand kef\u00edrer with a caricature of adolf hitler . 
  the idea for the social networks fueled by hundreds of people , the authors decided that the `` leader of the kefir '' begin to produce and sell . 
  within a few weeks in domestic shops discovering a new dairy product called kef\u00edrer . 
  it was created this year as a prank idea in the online campaign of three young creative people from brno : david koutn\u00fd , tomas musil and luke lukes . 
  according to the authors did not initially aim to produce a product at all , but somehow it went wrong . 
  in collaboration with a dairy kozojedsk\u00fd yard near brno will begin the product of hundreds of pieces monthly to distribute to selected market . 
  predominantly internet hoax ( in the streets of brno also appeared billboard ) wanted to draw attention to the growing extremism . 
  initially heralded blitzkrieg new kefir , later leader of the arrival to the shelves . 
  `` cleaner kefir drink you have , '' authors talked on social networks and with them hundreds of supporters . 
  for some , it was excellent fun , for others already behind the edge . 
  whether it was a clever marketing ploy or a little chance , now it is clear that it will not stop at a virtual kefir . 
  the product with a portrait of hitler should soon appear in grocery stores my food and later probably in the network harvested . 
  `` production actually run . 
  i believe that in stores kef\u00edrer appear in the next week or two , `` confirmed jan svab idnes.cz of dairy kozojedsk\u00fd court . 
  now these smaller dairy starts to fill up the bottle kefir instead of an unnamed large corporate dairies with which the authors say the product agree . 
  `` we thought it a good idea how to respond to the situation in europe , a shift towards extremist parties . 
  hitler is an icon of evil . 
  the company tends around these icons tread carefully and to be sure not to think of them . 
  people would rather displaced from their lives , therefore we thought was nice . 
  it is clear that we all understand , `` explains ceo why cooperation nodded . 
  negative reactions are not afraid . 
  we are fighting for the right thing , says coauthor kef\u00edrera according to luke , lukes , creative artists from copyright trio , the idea was born as a joke and a recession until then the party members decided that they would `` fight for the right thing . '', 
  `` europe will come to us restless , so we wanted to nudge . 
  not by chance we teamed up with the project memory of the nation . 
  we think that the 2nd world war should not be forgotten . 
  this is the only form that we wanted to perform , `` he explained with the fact that from every bottle sold some of the money from flowing to a research project memory of the nation . 
  not everyone shared the enthusiasm of the authors . 
  some people in the debate on social networks indicate the campaign for hyenism , spiritual father kef\u00edreru have also complained about argo copying envelopes novel timur vermes it 's here again . 
  `` this is ridiculous , resemblance is purely iconic , '' he says lukes . 
  as another fantasy fetus was in a successful campaign fictional rival kef\u00edrera called ml\u00e9komou\u0161 . 
  whether it will also produce bottles with a picture of the dictator stalin is not yet clear . 
  you 'll receive ethical , selling kefir with a caricature of hitler ? 
  yes 9812 no . 
   well , ours is 1473 $ . 
  so you are getting less than a quarter of the minimum wage . 
  and even on minimum wage , people are complaining about not having enough money . 
  that 's obvious to me . 
  show me a country where most of the people earning minimum wage do n't complain . 
  in germany you have much higher rent fees , much higher food prices etc. 
   refugees once recieved significantly less money than our domestic people on benefits , this was ruled unconstitutional . 
  that 's very interesting , i will remember that . 
   it is possible to survive on that money ( it is really the bottom line minimum ) , but you will not have a decent life . 
  that 's why i used word `` survive '' . 
  even in poland you 'll have a life for 300 $ monthly that is far , far from life anyone would describe as `` decent '' . 
   around 30 % were rejected it looks like we will have in europe hundred of thousands people wandering here and there who was rejected . 
  damn , what a mess . 
  thank you very much for your detailed reply . 
  so it looks like it is possible to survive on a welfare if you do n't need to pay for rent and utilities . 
  i assume that 's why this amount of money is chosen , to let them survive . 
  worst case scenario they get 273 $ ( 364 $ - 25 % ) per adult person . 
  to put here some perspective , minimal wage in poland is ... 272 $ ( although i know prices in germany are higher , especially rent and food , but refugees do n't pay rent ) . 
   if you are rejected , you will be asked to leave the country . 
  are there any statistics how much percent of requests are rejected ? 
  could someone tell me how exactly the procedure about refugees looks like in germany ? 
  i asked this question already . 
  i 'm reading opinions of people who say that refugees will live on nice welfare their whole life if they wo n't want to work . 
  i assume it 's not true , but will they be required to find a job at some point ? 
  some follow up : truck driver blames train driver for the crash saying that train driver had enough time to stop . 
  also he stood there because the barriers were down . 
  like he did n't want to break the barrier and just did nothing hoping for the train to stop . 
  he obviously also ignored the red light before barriers were going to go down .
