out of curiosity , would you then say that `` england are great '' when talking about the national team ? 
  those damn brits use plural for football teams as well . 
  `` chelsea are great '' or `` stoke are average '' just sounds ridiculous . 
  similarly , they abbreviate `` mathematics '' as `` maths '' but not once have i seen them abbreviate `` economics '' as `` econs . '', 
  oh , is it finnish ? 
  i used to watch the cartoon all the time when i was a kid and i never realized that . 
  one trzepak near my childhood house had particularly thick bars , so i was able to climb it and sit there fairly comfortably . 
  that was a source of pride of 10-year-old me . 
  you also made me realize that i 've never seen those away from poland . 
  not in england , not in france , not in italy , not in usa etc. 
  i had no idea it was an eastern european thing . 
  how exactly would they do it though ? 
  russia could purchase yuans from any financial institution , private individuals or whomever . 
  china would n't be a party in any of these transactions . 
  i 'm not in poland right now , so i 'm not listening to the debate about what 's going on as much as i 'd like , but my impression is that it 's just for show . 
  tusk 's government has often been criticized by prawo i sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 ( pis ) as being too appeasing towards russia and some ` show of strength ' definitely plays well . 
  plus , it 's a show of support for ukraine . 
  however , it 's a risk-free move . 
  russia just wo n't touch poland . 
  we have a growing stature in eu , we 're in nato , and we 're closely allied with us . 
  any attack on poland would leave west no choice but to actually respond . 
  on the other hand , it 's not like we 'll just move into crimea without coordination with the west either . 
  seeing plenty of good stuff being written here about poland over the past few days has been nice , but `` balls of steel '' comments are unwarranted . 
  we 're not putting anything on the line . 
  ( i ) us inflation [ is low ] ( http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?&amp;id=cpiaucsl&amp;scale=left&amp;range=max&amp;cosd=1947-01-01&amp;coed=2014-01-01&amp;line_color=%230000ff&amp;link_values=false&amp;line_style=solid&amp;mark_type=none&amp;mw=4&amp;lw=1&amp;ost=-99999&amp;oet=99999&amp;mma=0&amp;fml=a&amp;fq=quarterly&amp;fam=avg&amp;fgst=lin&amp;transformation=pch&amp;vintage_date=2014-03-04&amp;revision_date=2014-03-04 ) . 
  also , look at the [ tips spread ] ( http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?&amp;id=dgs10,dfii10&amp;scale=left,left&amp;range=5yrs,5yrs&amp;cosd=2009-02-27,2009-02-27&amp;coed=2014-02-27,2014-02-27&amp;line_color=%230000ff,%23ff0000&amp;link_values=false,false&amp;line_style=solid,solid&amp;mark_type=none,none&amp;mw=4,4&amp;lw=1,1&amp;ost=-99999,-99999&amp;oet=99999,99999&amp;mma=0,0&amp;fml=a,a&amp;fq=daily,daily&amp;fam=avg,avg&amp;fgst=lin,lin&amp;transformation=lin,lin&amp;vintage_date=2014-03-04,2014-03-04&amp;revision_date=2014-03-04,2014-03-04 ) . 
  us is not devaluing its currency . 
  ( ii ) i 'm not sure where the guardian article you linked to says that more transactions are conducted in yuan than in dollar . 
  it simply said that china became the largest trading nation in the world , which is not the same thing . 
  * ( iii ) it takes two to tango . 
  maybe it 'd make more sense for china to pay with yuan , but i do n't think that , say , brazil , germany , india and whoever else they are trading with would agree , so i do n't see it happening anytime soon . 
  i 'm not saying that dollar will keep its status forever , but i also do n't see why many developed nations would risk switching from dollar to yuan at this point . 
  * maybe i missed some key line or you linked to the wrong article ; i 'm reading what you wrote in good faith , 
  it 's not like any country can forbid any other country from using its currency . 
  russia can just buy it . 
  i agree , but i 'm also not sure what is the endgame for the west if we collectively decide to take some action . 
  if there 's some kind of war , what would that even look like ? 
  how would developed nations even fight with each other in xxi ? 
  can someone protect crimea without this leading to escalation ? 
  the cold hard truth is that crimea is n't worth anything like this to the west . 
  it 's also not worth anything like this to russia , but putin still is willing to pay much higher cost than anyone in the west . 
  as for economic sanctions , if the whole west introduces them simultaneously , then russia will feel it , but it 's not clear that russian decision-makers would . 
  meanwhile , look at [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_in_the_european_energy_sector ) . 
  if russia responds with cutting off ng supply , the effect will ripple through the whole europe . 
  countries can adjust to this , but it 'd probably take years . 
  i agree , i 'm generally sympathetic to `` there 's a meaningful iq difference between races '' theory ( or at least not as dismissive as many people are ) . 
  however , i looked at some more details of pisa report . 
  i ideally wanted to find a comparison between all french or german students and pure french/germans to see if there 's a difference and if so , what is it . 
  i could n't find anything like this . 
  the best i found is a comparison between results from 2003 , ' 06 , '09 and '12 that adjusts for demographic changes . 
  i did n't read deeply into the methodology , but i believe it simply adjusts for socioeconomic class and ethnic changes in the demographic . 
  here 's how it 's described in the excel file i downloaded :  adjusted scores are obtained by estimating a regression of students ' demographic characteristics on math performance with demographic characteristics centred at the 2012 values . 
  demographic characteristics that entered the model are : students ' age , gender , pisa index of economic , social and cultural status , immigrant background ( first or second generation ) and whether students speak a language at home which is different from the language of instruction . 
  adjusted values therefore represent average scores in previous assessment assuming that demographic characteristics remained unchanged . 
  see annex a5 for more details on the estimation of adjusted trends . 
  i uploaded the table here : [ link ] ( http://imgur.com/jscwtvt ) . 
  the more i look at them , the weirder the results look . 
  korea went from 471 to 554 to 547 to 469 between 2003 and 2012 . 
  wtf ? 
  poland went from 498 to 510 to 499 to 518 . 
  france went from 523 to 510 to 501 to 495 . 
  there seems to be significant variation after adjusting for a lot of demographics-related factors . 
  i am clueless as to where those differences come from , especially since we are talking about 2003-2012 period , so there unlikely to have been any large , structural changes in many countries . 
  it could be a part of the story , but then again it 'd think that it 's the same in romania , bulgaria or hungary , and yet those countries score significantly lower than poland . 
  besides , after high school graduation a lot of students go on to study subjects that are unlikely to make them really good at something that 's in high demand . 
  that 's one huge drawback of subsidized higher education . 
  for any non-poles : we actually have a [ higher school of tourism and recreation ] ( http://www.sgtir.edu.pl ) . 
  i 'm not saying that pisa scores are somewhat not representative . 
  i agree that they tell us that young poles actually do better than young danes and worse than japanese . 
  however , i am skeptical that we can tell where those differences come from . 
  is it something about education per se that we do particularly well ? 
  if so , what exactly is it ? 
  as i wrote above , lack of constant testing and good atmosphere were the first things that came to my mind , but i have no idea if it 's actually that . 
  in usa students have much more freedom in choosing their coursework . 
  many countries are wealthier , so you would expect that parents can provide more education outside of school , be it more extracurriculars , more travel or more whatever . 
  i 'd expect those to be beneficial as well , but many of those countries score below us . 
  what 's more , our schooling system has no particularly innovative or unusual structure . 
  kids come in and they have classes . 
  there 's teachers ' union and it 's next to impossible to fire a teacher . 
  i can hardly think of a more simple system , though having gone through it myself , i might be biased . 
  one more thing , and i 'm sure poles here will agree , ** cheating is prevalent and socially acceptable . 
  ** i 'm now studying in us and the difference in this regard is staggering . 
  when i was in lo ( high school ; graduated in ' 10 ) , there was a ` cheat sheet ' that was shared among class members . 
  giving answers to the student sitting next to you is something natural ; not doing that can result in mild ostracism . 
  teachers know it is taking place constantly and by and large they give a silent approval . 
  in us cheating results in expulsions , suspensions etc. 
  it 's not socially accepted . 
  and yet despite that poles end up doing so much better on those tests !, 
  i think everyone can tell what i 'm getting at : poland has high average scores , it 's good and i like it , but i have no idea why . 
  if someone from denmark ( 18 points below poland in math ) or norway ( 29 points below ) asked me what poland is doing right , the only honest answer is that no one has any idea . 
  if anything , i 'd say that poland 's success in pisa is another evidence that we ( i.e. 
  people in general ) do n't really know a lot about how education works . 
  for anyone not living in poland , here 's how our middle and high school look like : you have about ~ 10 subjects per school year ( there 's math , polish , english/german , history , all the natural sciences but also a few hours of religion , physical education ) . 
  you get your books , you show up to classes , and you go through those books chapter by chapter . 
  you get grades for hws and tests , and you have an import and exam at the end of middle school and at the end of high school . 
  and that 's it . 
  what the hell ? 
  it 's not like we have revolutionized education , but if you look at the pisa mean scores we are 18 points below japan in math . 
  there 's an article every week about how children in japan study for half the day and let me assure you , it does n't happen in poland . 
  if i had to make a wild guess , i 'd say that the fact that your day-to-day grades are irrelevant could help a little .
