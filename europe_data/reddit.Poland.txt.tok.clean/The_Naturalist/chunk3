  it 's fascinating to watch culture war in action . 
  why does it have to be a choice between extremes ? 
  why does it has to be `` nasty racist sd supporter '' tribe vs `` antiracist narrative activist '' tribe ? 
  how about talking about real issues , you know , like grownups . 
  is n't it happening ? 
  if you are in your thirties and you were educated in eu , you know at least a couple of people who participated in erasmus exchange . 
  you also experience the free movement across the borders . 
  we also have a casual conversation in this reddit . 
  crazy times , no ? 
  in this reply i 'm also addressing / u/ikolla . 
  i have nothing but disdain for sd for their bigotry and general assholeness . 
  but seems to me that everyone who dares to question the official narrative is automatically deemed `` racist '' , and you guys throw this word around without even trying to prove anything . 
  power lying in the accusation , not the evidence . 
  i daresay you can be honest in looking at stats and not be a racist . 
  so let 's try that . 
   sweden is the rape capital , but that is because they count sexual harrasment under `` rape '' , so the statistic is quite misleading . 
  correlation is not causation . 
  in swedish law biggest shift in legal definition of rape has happened in 1992 ( inclusion of sexual assault into def of rape ) , but this does n't account for continuous growth of registered rape cases [ between 1975 and now ] ( http://imgur.com/qdmie6y ) . 
  you ca n't explain 10-fold increase in reported sex crime by `` increased awareness '' , you would need much stronger evidence than just vague correlation . 
  can you explain [ 11 % increase in rape cases ] ( http://bra.se/bra/nytt-fran-bra/arkiv/press/2015-03-31-slutlig-brottsstatistik-2014.html ) just in one year by `` increased awareness and women rights '' ? 
  also , police reports in similar countries to sweden , sometimes stipulate how more likely people from some cultural backgrounds are to commit sex crimes ( [ in finland mena immigrants 17 times more likely ] ( http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/tutkimuksia-sarja/xz5bk8f2h/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf ) ) the last official swedish crime statistics that deals with background of crime perpetrators says people from middle east / north africa commited 5 times more rapes than `` natives '' http://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/valdtakt-och-sexualbrott.html ( after that we have the have silence , in accordance with [ antiracism religion ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/27/antiracism-our-flawed-new-religion.html ) ) . 
  sd is a horrible bunch and their rise to power is a painful thing to watch . 
  but all their opponents work very , very hard on their success . 
  as long as you insist on ignoring reality , they will be growing . 
  edit for typos . 
   cause of polish speaking minority in lithuania and way lithuanian authorities treat them let 's not forget how polish minority is treating lithuania [ link in polish ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/1,75477,17760740,polacy_na_litwie___koniec_fikcyjnej_jednosci.html ), 
  yes , there were criminal , murderous assholes in europe . 
  like everywhere else , no ? 
  about jailed politicians , maybe first named those that you know have stolen stuff . 
  then notify prokuratura . 
  do you understand what `` public debt '' is ? 
  in case of poland it is mostly [ government bonds issued predominantly to polish citizens ] ( http://images.slideplayer.pl/1/427931/slides/slide_14.jpg ) . 
  there is nothing terrifying or [ unusual ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/public-debt-europe.jpg ) about it . 
  it does pose risks when it grows too much , but in a healthy economy it reflects strength of a national economy as much as anything else . 
  ( because it means that domestic and foreign investors trust in future growth ) . 
  where does he say anything about belonging ? 
  take off the tinfoil hat , buddy . 
  i for one belong to the realm of homer , herodotus , chaucer , rabelais , copernicus , newton , bacon , kant , bach , rousseau and goethe . 
  where you belong is completely your choice . 
   if by independence you mean sucking us cock it 's ok . 
  here in the west we do n't mind your gay fantasies . 
   if by vibrant liberal democracies you mean corrupt and morally bankrupt kleptocracies thieves happen in all governments , in democracies they go to jail or at least do n't get re-elected . 
  prefer belorussia much ? 
   and if by lifting out of poverty you mean 20 % unemployment ... polish unemployment this year is [ around 10 % ] ( http://stat.gov.pl/obszary-tematyczne/rynek-pracy/bezrobocie-rejestrowane/bezrobocie-rejestrowane-i-kwartal-2015-r-,3,19.html ) . 
  by `` lifting out of poverty '' he might mean that polish growth of gdp per capita between 1989 and 2013 was [ highest in europe ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/future-development/posts/2015/02/11-poland-post-socialist-transition-piatkowski ) or that [ poland went from 32 % to 60 % ] ( http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/how_poland_can_become_a_european_growth_engine ) of western european gdp per capita within last 25 years . 
  you are always welcome , and i say it without mockery . 
  but not quite right  it 's [ declension ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declension ) and 2-4 take nominativus and 5 forward take genitivus of the noun . 
  the solution to this conundrum would be not to have more than 4 beers , 
  i would n't . 
  they tend to flip ( last time 780 000 years ago ) . 
  one word . 
  yumm , 
  but this statistic is not insane . 
  the article compares it to 1 % of jewish population in poland after the war , but since those were soviet aparatchiks , perhaps you should compare it to pre-war numbers - 10 % of polish citizens were jewish , and among educated professions ( doctors , artists , lawyers , etc ) it was circa 30 % . 
  the fact that soviets promoted jews in communist structures is not surprising , and also did n't last forever ( 1968 ) . 
  all cool , m8 . 
  apologies for reckless badge throwing !, 
  edit : on double checking , i actually threw it sarcastically at myself . 
  still , point taken . 
  in your link only eisner and rosa luxembourg seem to be jewish . 
  it just seems like a sweeping generalizations i keep hearing . 
  it 's like in poland i hear folks saying that polish communists were jewish . 
  nope , great , great majority were actually polish , great surprise . 
  uh-huh !, 
  the first `` left '' was linked to french revolution , and there you will not find jews among organizers - quite on the contrary : voltaire had quite antisemitic views . 
  also you will not find jews among saint-simon , robert owen , proudhon or fourier ... 
  damn it . . where are those jews hiding ... then finally !, 
  yes !, 
  i found one !, 
  but then he was also an assimilationist , who believed that the way of jewish emancipation must be via abandonment of judaism ... ehh , tough day to be a jew-hater :(, 
  up for class and cold head . 
  i have similar observation . 
  influence of american movie/tv culture is something i did n't take into account before . 
  or british misconception that their body-related mores is like in the continent , 
  next step : restoration of hussar units , 
  no , seriously they are not doing the same stuff as previous government did , not even close . 
  previous ruling party broke many rules . 
  pis is changing them . 
  * they are undermining the separation of powers , which since locke and montesque have been the safety mechanism against dictatorship . 
  ( legal changes to constitutional tribunal make it practically impossible to stop unconstitutional legislation , putting * prokuratura * under direct control of ministry ) * they are basically cancelling civil service in poland , by removing the requirement for civil servants to not be members of a political party * they are putting public media under direct control of government * and , wisienka na torcie , pad has pardoned his party colleagues the first moment he got to office . 
  who does that , for forks sake !, 
  1 ) why do you think the picture sums up everything pretty well ? 
  2 ) the association with nazi was well intended and obvious . 
  now you are just stretching it . 
  plus verhofstadt is belgian and juncker is luxembourgian . 
  the picture is offensive and idiotic . 
  3 ) do you know what propaganda means ? 
  this admittedly weak article , is just an opinion piece in vaguely unknown `` network of student journalists '' or whatever . 
  thanks . 
  good info . 
  is nyheter idag related in any way with sd ? 
  is it considered mainstream ? 
  just curious . 
  nope . 
  romania is awesome and we should be allies . 
  majority of connections are run danish-operated \u00d8resundtog . 
  this train does n't go as far as stockholm though . 
  \u00d6resundt\u00e5g is used by thousands , and new regulations will increase travel time . 
  it 's going to suck when you commute to copenhagen to work . 
  this `` myth '' is based in willful ignorance and misinterpratation of info from public portal of legal information : http://ppiop.rcl.gov.pl/ click `` orzeczenia trybuna\u0142u konstytucyjnego '' .
