  you will see numerous `` unexecuted '' marks . 
  so someone counted those from times of civic platform rule and decreed that they ignored ruling of cc 49 times . 
  except that 's not what unexecuted means . 
  if you open any justification or comment you will see stuff like : `` poddany kontroli przepis w zakresie wskazanym w sentencji orzeczenia utraci moc obowi\u0105zuj\u0105c\u0105 z dniem 30 listopada 2016 r. '' which means offending law never came into force ( exactly because of cc ruling ) . 
  so all that talk about po government breaking cc rulings , is quite simply a lie and a manipulation . 
  comparing constitutional court with liberum veto is either utterly naive or really cynical . 
  considering my experiences with `` law '' and `` justice '' voter base , i rather suspect the latter , though of course no judgement passing here . 
  constitutional court is being called `` relic of communism '' - that one is a particularly cynical use of `` poisoning the well '' rhetorical trick ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poisoning_the_well ) . 
  in reality , constitutional courts are a standard institution of so called free world present in france , germany , austria , spain etc. 
  and neither law in its abstract sense is most important , nor is `` will of the nation '' . 
  notwithstanding , if people really start weighing `` will of the nation '' against the constitution , then to hell with our dear country . 
  pilsudski 's saying : `` nar\u00f3d wspania\u0142y , ale ludzie ku * wy '' resounds from before a century ago with a new cruel echo . 
  no , not `` will of the nation '' , for goodness sake . 
  do n't you smell the nasty fumes of history in this line ? 
  last time our neighbours put `` will of the nation '' above freedom and constitution , we ended up with triumph des willens ( eh , godwin 's law ) . 
  the most important thing in my country is individual freedom and citizen individual rights , protected by the constitution . 
  the same freedoms are defended against despotism by clear separation of powers : judicial , legislatory and executive . 
  to all those , who wipe their protofascist mouths with `` will of the nation '' while sitting on 19 % support of the said nation : ask yourselves , if that is poland our ancestors bled for . 
  give us an example of situation in which moral behaviour is one thing , and honourable is a different one and extension of morality . 
  oh yes . 
  i can thinking of so many creative ways of thanking russia , 
  romania should join . 
  but are you guys ok with hungarians in ? 
   thank tim berners-lee for the world wide web !, 
  ftfy, 
  it 's rather the opposite , pis government will do as they please . 
  in poland president has limited powers , among others : `` not signing the bills '' . 
  he definitely will be signing all the bills . 
  do n't expect any impact , 
  yes , not just that . 
  orban explicitly says his aim is to end liberal democracy in hungary , and have something like putin 's `` sovereign democracy '' a la putin .

  upvote , not because i agree , but because of comprehensive reply . 
  and because it 's not wykop , 
  that is very true . 
  i agree . 
  as long as they are a minority party , i prefer to have them in parliament than united left . 
   yeah , but not based on their religion . 
  sure . 
  but i think we need similar harsh measures against islam , as france instituted against catholic church after the french revolution . 
  who out of the list ? 
  i hate failing to notice sarcasm online -_-, 
   you see , `` white men '' are part of the oppressor class , while black women are part of the victim class . 
  that being the case except ... is it really the case ? 
  it 's just a sjw narrative , like being a new age crystal worshipper , or westboro baptist church . 
  it 's a self-explaining , self-fulfilling ideology . 
  an extrapolation of marxist paradigm onto modern reality that seems utterly contrived and artificial to most people ... 
  and raised open hand by a bald-shaved youth is just an ancient roman greeting . 
  and typically ironic . 
  not necessarily . 
  two most atheistic countries in europe are estonia and czech republic . 
  ireland or italy are much more religious . 
  non-news of the week ... edit : mistakenly replied to comment , not post . 
  wait but that is actually brilliant . 
  how about we greet refugees with * hurriya aleikum * :d, 
  i am strongly against proposed fundamentalist catholic changes , but putting it like you do sounds equally fundamentalist to me . 
  it is an attempt to deproblematize an ethically complex issue . 
  abortion is a dramatic and ethically nuanced thing . 
  was this sung in aramaic or armenian ? 
  thank you . 
  i dont know anyone in poland he wishes ukraine bad . 
  anyone . 
  i know plenty who went to support any pro independence movement . 
  on the actual streets of kiev . 
  i wish in a decade or two we can talk calmly about volyn and other darker chapters of shared history - on both sides perhaps . 
  for now - believe it or not - plenty polish people root for ukraine , for its independence , for its stability and welfare , for weeding out corruption and joining the club of countries that at least try to follow the rule of law , the spirit of individual liberties and civil rights . 
  i 've seen this many times . 
  can you link to some source ? 
  i 'd be happy to debunk lies , once i determine they are actually lies, 
  with sentiment , usually . 
  that was random indeed . 
  there is such a giant discrepancy between jewish and polish memory in this respect . 
  on one side we hear jewish memory , of polin being cemetery of jews , of antisemitic neighbours , jedwabne , kielce etc. . . on the other side , we poles , remember centuries of tolerance , we remember berek joselewicz , we remember vibrant jewish-polish culture of early 20 century : brzechwa , kiepura , finkelstein , rubinstein , wars , szpilman , tyrmand , schulz , tuwim ... all the above are true , yet with somewhat biased selection , we end up with memories tinted so differently ... 
  it 's usually just in warsaw . 
  but i was calling someone in krakow 48 minutes ago , and there were sirens across the city - maybe it 's spreading ? 
  i can not agree here . 
  the very fact that the attacks happen primarily in random european countries , shows that times of al-qaida and it 's anti-american narrative are gone . 
  isis is a completely different kind of animal . 
  anti-american rhetoric is close to minimum , and they almost do n't mention israel at all . 
  the ideology is a `` purer '' form of religious fascism , driven just by hatred of the infidel world . 
  ugro-finnic unity much ? 
  the article does n't demonstrate what people who were persecuted actually wrote . 
  good news !, 
  and on a side note , some people call this `` doorstep '' homeland . 
  quite so . 
  and in my late 30s , i had loads of fun , 
  spend afternoons and evenings on the banks of wisla river , where pubs , live music , street food and crowds of people create the festival atmosphere all summer . 
  if into `` smarter '' stuff , see jewish history museum , warsaw uprising museum and copernicus center of science . 
  it 's puritan in the sense of moral absolutes and dualism . 
  there was some ideal of moral purity in old religious puritans . 
  there is an ideal of moral purity in modern egalitarian ideology . 
  ( disclaimer : i do believe that fight for gender equality is a valid and much needed . 
  i notice inherent puritanism in it , just like you might be a christian and recognize puritanism or fundamentalism in religion ), 
  there is something puritan in this kind of thinking , albeit this puritanism is derived from leftist ideology , rather than religion . 
  yes , i mean an additional bonus treaty that can serve both as enhancement of nato and a hedge against nato failure . 
  we used to have that in the past https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93romanian_alliance , lost chance in a way . 
  experts on both sides note the massive potential : ( example in polish : https://www.bbn.gov.pl/ftp/dok/03/35_kbn_pacula.pdf ) . 
  but political will and cultural awareness within societies are lacking . 
  in polish-romanian relations we need more of everything : * strategic defence coordination * common military exercises , especially in air force * foreign policy hotline - cultural exchange, 
  btw some sort of polish-romanian geopolitical alliance is my big dream .
