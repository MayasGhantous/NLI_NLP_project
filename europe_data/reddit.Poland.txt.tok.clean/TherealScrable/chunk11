  i really hope this dumb proposal from germany wo n't be accepted . 
  it seems to be actually promoting illegal migration . 
  they are just in an adventure park . 
  but they are polite people . 
  would n't this be actually semi-local news ? 
  such things happen all the time . 
  and in the end it is turkey 's decision . 
  although it is the international part of spiegel ... no wait , it is the german part of spiegel ... well , that makes it easier to say , that they have also deserved it for their `` slightly '' biased reporting . 
  laughable ... `` right-wing populist parties '' either it comes from some farlefts or from the german press . 
  the only populist i see , is the heavy populism from the ruling leftwing governments . 
  also none of these is the same . 
  this is pretty much the author summing up the euroskeptic faction in the eu parliament ... 
  pretty bad . 
  i also see homosexuality as some form of disease , or mental disorder . 
  it definetly is not normal . 
  but it can be accepted in some way . 
  so : \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ^ ^ ^ ^ preparing_to_get_banned, 
  meh , the guardian is pretty much the rt of the pc people ... 
  yeahyeah . . just because you believe that it happened like that , it does n't mean that everyone who is for an actual investigation is a crazy nutjob . 
  also in the end your opinion does n't matter , since you ca n't speak for poland . 
  how do you want to know that the russian `` investigation '' did n't fake things . 
  actually one of most disrespectable thing about them was , that the russians immediately said , that everyone was drunk on the plane . 
  please continue closing your eyes and do not think critically , just accept everything , which goes according to your ideology , but then , please keep your mouth shut or actually look directly at the current situation and see that the `` investigation '' was complete bullshit . 
  also note , that still does not want to return the wreck , which is ** polish property **, 
  although in this case he could be right . 
  only an international independent investigation could help , if it is not too late . 
  i do n't understand why this article has upvotes , but that which i have posted earlier and which is pretty much the same gets downvoted . 
  how much i love it ? 
  i hate it ... 
  although not 100 % . 
  but about 60 % . 
  and that is mostly because of the `` united europe '' thing and the huge centralization of power into brusselles ... 
  if the eu was about to return back to being an economic alliance : go for it !, 
  then i would certainly support it . 
  and maybe even like it . 
  their problem . 
  at least we are n't invading anyone . 
  it is n't like that russia is bullying us and actually all of its eastern neighbours ... 
  because the wreck of the euro is still in russia , because the fukushima powerplants is still in russia , because the earthquake is still in russia ... 
  if you have nothing to add , then please do n't even try ... 
  alright , then tell me why noone calls the cdu populist ? 
  or at least merkel , since she was switching sides like a tennis ball in a match of tennis . 
  as i have seen in germany , either you have the lefties or just the `` old '' parties , which are all almost the same . 
  the afd also seems to be the only party to have a different opinion about mass-immigration ( and i would support them , if there were n't other issues ) . 
  say whatever you want . 
  this is actually a legitimate thought . 
  due to how russia and tusk handled the ` accident ' , such theories wo n't stop , except there will be further investigation conducted by international independent groups ... 
  at least the title does n't say that the afd is a `` right populist '' party , as most of the german media does ( which is bs ) well , this is what happens when there is no opposition and there are only two extremes . 
  either you cut your ear off or your eye . 
  your choice . 
  at least for me , in germany there is no party which is n't extreme in some matters . 
  well , you got ta be tolerant, 
  and just to think about it : this was caused by the illegal appointment of 5 consitutional judges , 3 of which were later removed and still causing a big imbalance of power inside the court ... and yes the constitutional court was even before all that politicised and there was a rivalry going on between po and pis . 
  also people , please stop blaming pis for everything , either they would have been unable to do anything at all or it is as it is . 
  again , this is because of the illegal appointment of 5 po supporters into the cc . 
  3 of which later were removed . 
  and you should know that a judge earns a lot , so of course they wo n't leave . 
  the cc should n't have been included into the rivalry between po and pis in the first place , but po did it all the time . 
  and yes , i am getting butthurt about those comments here , whose writers seem to only rely on reports from theguardian or some other bs media , which actively tries to manipulate your opinion ... and no , thenews , reuters or some other news media , which i have yet to find are actually legit . 
  our country is not taking religion that serious as potrayed in those idiotic medias ... 
  wrong . 
  the law which was made does n't allow you to fire any member of the cc ... also the slowing down , in the end it was because of po doing its thing just when they were about to leave and that was also against the constitution . 
  no , i did not . 
  and you do know that poland only survived because of its nationalism . 
  polish souvereignity is one of the most important things . 
  as is a `` government '' or society itself . 
  these are artificial constructs , which are actually ** needed ** . 
  and i do not care where my ancestors of ancestors or whenever that should be , came from , i know that my national identity is polish . 
  and in the end , i believe in a strong state , which is representative of its people ... 
  the eu government does not represent the people . 
  and it is as it is , in this case : the eu wo n't work , the end . 
  no wonder . 
  if that proposal would have been accepted , every member of the eu would have shot itself into its own leg . 
  you made me laugh . 
  of course there is a future in a souvereign europe . 
  but there is none in a oppressed europe . 
  yeah , it is only the british who oppose total destruction of national identity . 
  hey , that 's a good one !, 
  in that case , we will have to leave the eu in the last moment , to preserve our national souvereignity as well as our national interests . 
  although this will happen maybe in 100 years , when everyone left the eu anyways . 
  nobody will work for europe . 
  also how do you want to achieve it ? 
  you will always oppress 80 % of the population . 
  all of us have our own identity . 
  we do n't need a superstate . 
  and i do not care about competing with the superpowers . 
  what i care is my country being capable of representing its own population and enforce its own values . 
  the problem are not only radioactive particles , but also contaminated water , which mostly gets sent to the sea . 
  and even the best filters wo n't filter out an excessive amount of particles . 
  no matter what . 
  why should we get rid of a very reliable source of energy ? 
  it is mostly clean because of these filters . 
  good luck living in a hole without electricity then , if you are so eager to get rid of them . 
  yeahyeah , sorry but technology has advanced and we have filters which will filter out most of the toxic gases . 
  and nuclear powerplants are far more dangerous , not only by the local level but the regional , too . 
  unlike coal powerplants . 
  thanks germany !, 
  why ? 
  well , the german press is very one-sided on this matter , since most of it relies on pro-po press , if not then all . 
  also schulz was one of the first to say that poland is being `` putinized '' ...
