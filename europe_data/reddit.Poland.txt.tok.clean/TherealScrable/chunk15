  as if we were charging their tanks with sabres , that 's a historical lie . 
  but it is true that we used horses to transport our weapons to the frontlines . 
  the only thing which could happen could be , like you have said , that it will become a half-born , which dies in a matter of seconds . 
  but somehow it is very hard for me , to believe that there exists such possibility . 
  well , it could indeed happen between germany , sweden and maybe the benelux ? 
  no idea . 
  i would just hope that nato remains in place . 
  otherwise we will have a pretty dark future , since if nato falls apart , russia wo n't hesitate to somehow gain claims and invade certain countries . 
  in the next 30 years ... let 's say ... 
  the eu will change or may not even exist at all . 
  do not forget that the soviets invaded poland twice . 
  the first time they have failed . 
  the second time they had help from an ally which would later backstab them , ** too **, 
  but only if russia pulls out of ukraine . 
  sorry , but that is self-imposed . 
  i did n't actually look at it like that ... well germany certainly does n't want to spend much onto its military ... 
  they are far below the 2 % line and are decreasing spending even further . 
  although many central european countries do the opposite since russia 's actions . 
  but since it is rt , i do n't think we have to worry about it becoming a real thing . 
  and sch\u00e4uble seems also a bit delusioned about the current situation in the eu and in europe . 
  if my country needs me , i will be there . 
  if an ally needs help , i wo n't fight or at least as long as possible not , but try to help via different needs and support our government to help them . 
  if my country attacks another country ... then just nope doing that for a pseudo union which more often then not demonises my country as well as imposes the weirdest things you could think off ... definetly not . 
  uh we do n't . 
  these are nato battlegroups as well as a nato rapid reaction force . 
  since there are , or better , there ** is ** a certain country which opposes bases in the post-communist countries . 
  source . 
  rt ** cringe ** no the eu needs no common army . 
  we poles are already modernizing our armies , readying them for possible foreign aggression . 
  our neighbours in the west are doing the opposite . 
  and now if national armies would be dissolved or intergrated into an `` eu army '' ... 
  i think give it 4 years and you will see all equipment being scrapped while one small group of soldiers is supposed to guard the eu ... just no . 
  no idea . 
  but this winter or at least this begin of the winter has stunned me , too . 
  as hard as it could . 
  ca n't await the insect plague coming next spring , especially all those wasps . 
  then it seems , that i do not understand `` europe '' . 
  although europe ca n't speak , but alright . 
  what happens in poland is an unfortunate row of events sparked by the disellected party po . 
  the best is , that even normal events for poland get featured as if there is a second coming of literally hitler in poland . 
  the reports on poland , especially german ones and economical ones , are resembling a very fearsome resemblance with russia 's propaganda outlet rt. 
  it had to be said . 
  we are obviously so evil , we are the `` fourth reich '' and are going to invade ourselves . 
  also some meta : did vote brigades arrive here , since there are even normally discussing people getting downvoted to hell , meanwhile those who say , `` muh pis is evil '' are upvoted as nothing else . 
  pis did n't even do anything . 
  well , po did its job . 
  they succesfully f * cked up poland . 
  of course it did . 
  it is now the centre of all evil . 
  just look at these poor `` refugees '' for a moment . 
  almost gave an upvote . 
  but you have missed something . 
  the politicians themselves act like that . 
  always a nice slapfight , but this time po is taking it to far ... and yes po . 
  what is lost ? 
  is it your ego ? 
  what makes you think that ... ah let me guess ... 
  the massive rt-like propaganda i guess . 
  sorry , but pis is very different . 
  all pis members lost something to the communists , when martial law was imposed and they still seem to be led by that mindset . 
  now what po did is even worse , this is nowhere near democratic and you could have reacted more intelligent to this matter , but pis is very convinced to be right and i also support them in almost every matter . 
  rule number 1 : do not even care about votes . 
  they may give your ego a boost but in the end , if you are voicing your opinion downvote brigades will attack you . 
  it is n't a good excuse indeed , but how else are you supposed to kick potential blockers out , which should n't have been there in the first place ? 
  it is pretty clear that po planned ahead and knew pis would go head first into this . 
  the media which is mainly german owned as well as heavily influenced by po makes matters even worse , demonising pis . 
  there are still clear borders . 
  just like between poland and the citystate of gdansk, 
  i do not understand . 
  that was not a joke . 
  look it up : finland still having its territory before the winter wars , gdansk being a citystate , poland sharing a border with romania . 
  yugoslavia still existing, 
  these are just the pre-war borders ... 
  you would think so , in how german and other media reports on it . 
  but in the end it is the same everytime a different party gains power . 
  i 've never said it was n't . 
  but you ca n't say that countries like germany are actually `` sacrificing '' something . 
  it could be for some . 
  but there are sometimes questions , which are worth thinking for , but at the same time , there is no real answer ... 
  except the belgians actually want that to happen . 
  hrm ... no . 
  otherwise we could also ask ourselves , does humanity really need to exist ? 
  belgium has some kind of history . 
  in germany left-wing and right-wing like putin . 
  meanwhile in poland nobody likes him . 
  i 'm actually surprised that ukraine is `` only '' at -36 % , although being invaded by russia . 
  also it is fairly obvious that the outgoing foreign politics of love from russia make the neighbouring countries in central europe pretty nervous . 
  they would n't have accepted the `` bad '' things , if they were n't expected to have `` good '' things from these `` bad '' things happen . 
  almost like an investment . 
  because racism and euroscepticism are the same evil . 
  well , they already get demonised by pretty much everyone by now . 
  if it would be some angry person , it would be understandable due to schulz 's highly inappropiate comments ... well , our foreign minister seems to take the political shitfight to the next level . 
  which laws did they already broke , except that one which po also broke before it got diselected . 
  but only tens of thousands . 
  meanwhile the majority seems to support the government . 
  also the outcry is yet again pushed by opposition and foreign media . 
  and imagine no one cared that po ignored the law ... oh it happened . 
  double standards much ? 
  it is meant to be extremely hyperbolic . 
  an economic 1939 .
