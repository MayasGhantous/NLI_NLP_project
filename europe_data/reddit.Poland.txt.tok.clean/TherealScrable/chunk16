  again . 
  will merkel after being chancellor also work at gazprom ? 
  only 6 months ? 
  why not extend them . . well , until russia actually gets out of ukraine ? 
  alright , let 's nuke norway . ^ ( again ) ^ ( ^ would ^ be ^ funnier ^ if ^ being ^ a ^ swede ), 
  and then masked kind men without insignia appear and will take over the kitchen and the bathroom . 
  god damn it . 
  and they have already annexed my vodka . 
  this is pretty hilarious . 
  that 's what i always was saying ... well not this time . 
  i only said , that the left-wing in europe favors them more then pis . 
  i know that many rightist call them leftists and communists , since it is kind of a political insult . 
  just like nazi is . 
  i already did . 
  well alright : there is no european ideology . 
  but it may refer to the european ideologies , because there are similarities . 
  but there is n't something such as ** the ** ideology of europe . 
  it implies that , because it is probably going to happen , if a federation should be made . 
  germans want other things then poles , italians something different then britons . 
  sometimes even the opposite thing . 
  and it would be pretty hard to not oppress someone . 
  and actually a fully functional country does n't need any federation . 
   do n't start with migrant quotas poland voted for in accordance with a treaty poland ratified voluntarily was n't going to talk about that , but since you mention it , it was the decision of the party po , although nobody in poland wanted that . 
  one of the reasons why po was n't elected . 
  and how ? 
  well my home country gets run by a bunch of foreigners who have no idea of how culture and nationality work . 
  is that enough ? 
  maybe you should explain why it would be actually positive to make a union , since ** you ** are the one demanding changes . 
  i thought it was known to you : we are too different , we have different ideologies and cultures and also a completly different mentality . 
  and if it is about poland , we fought too much for our freedom and souvereignity without any outside help to jsut give it up . 
  we wo n't let ourself be oppressed by a `` superstate '' . 
  europe is n't america . 
  history plays a big role in this . 
  and no , you did n't really pointed out anything . 
  it was already clear that poland will once leave the warsaw pact , in fact people were clearly demanding it . 
  even when the last ressistance pockets of the ak in 1956 were extreminated by the communists . 
  if you expect arguments upon some shitposting , then you may as well wait outside and wait to be hit by an asteroid . 
   lol civic platform is not that left wing ... and have you seen what happened on the right when obama was elected ? 
  anyways , they are more favourable for the left wing . 
  they are closer to it . 
  and now they are crying and demonising . 
  i do not think so . 
  being left , does n't mean that you wo n't use violence to achieve your goal . 
  there is actually the same amount of people who are using violence . 
  and antifa is the worst one of these leftist groups . 
  they are one of the most violent ones and they have nothing lost here . 
  this scaremongering is just ridiculous and it was ridiculous since day one . 
  but the worst part is , that the eu wants to interfere into polish politics . 
  also schulz 's comment on the `` coup '' did n't really raise trust into the eu , and he did n't even apologized for that . 
  this crisis is n't a real one and it was caused by the former government party po , since they illegally elected 5 judges , although the next party should have elected them . 
  bad loosers . 
  the article seems to be ridden with a very negative tone against pis . 
  or simply put : it seems biased . 
  heavily . 
  also it seems like it is n't a nato training center actually maintained by nato , but more of a `` private '' one , if you could call it like that , so the title is misleading . 
  you were the one starting with the absurdity . 
  and you are keeping it . 
  so please , keep doing that , meanwhile i will remain sane . 
  wow , this comparison makes absolute no sense . 
  this is one of the most idiotic things i have read , just wow . 
  please think rational and actually think about the terrible vonsequences . 
  it would be catastrophic . 
  actually i think , when the eu becomes united , then russiawill reunite itself with it , if you know what i mean . 
  you do know that the eu is something between countries , while the usa is one country ? 
  and no , never let such a thing happen . 
  never . 
  for whom ? 
  if they are refugees . 
  also they have to come directly from a country where they were threatened and since they go through turkey and greece , they should n't be accepted . 
  and that 's what i always was saying . 
  scare them off , deport more of these migrants . 
  if they want shelter then they should accept it . 
  they certainly wo n't die from that . 
  it is fairly obvious , that russia indeed `` collects '' them . 
  or more of , it tries to consume countries chunk after chunk , sicne these territories are de-facto occupied by the russian military . 
  so in the end , maybe the first is not wrong but the rest is . 
  it should be a dashed line . 
  that 's how most maps mark the disputed territory between pakistan , india and china . 
  and some humanitarian grenades . 
  surpressed ethnic russians obviously . 
  and that 's a good thing !, 
  so where was the outrage when po broke the law ? 
  and still , you talked of protests from pis where only masked people participated , who of course burned monuments . 
  i do n't think that kaczynski used radical extremists . 
  it is more likely that it is a side-effect which will have to be contained . 
  actually there are always those morons , who think , causing violence would change anything . 
  sorry , i was too specific . 
  of course there are also other people , but it is indeed amplified by po and there is a clear border between the parties in poland . 
  po is politically closer to parties like nowoczesna then pis . 
  of course it is still far , but now they just want pis being protrayed as evil . 
  you also seem to forget that po did the same previously and no i am not justifying the actions of pis , just like po , they both reacted pretty childish upon each other . 
  but while po was able to do it behind the curtains without being a big deal , them breaking the constitution , pis thought they could do the same , well and this was clearly amplified by po . 
  it is a clear fight between po and pis , but po used their own dirty tactics . 
  this is where the hypocrisy starts . 
  and again , the democracy in poland is not in danger , especially since the plans of pis are actually known and if they do pull of something really crazy , they will be a lost cause . 
  it is hypocritical . 
  2 illegally voted are already enough to spark such a crisis . 
   at least these protesting pis do n't cover their faces and do n't burn monuments . 
  so you are implying only radical extremists support pis ? 
  woah , then kaczinsky is probably really the next hitler .
