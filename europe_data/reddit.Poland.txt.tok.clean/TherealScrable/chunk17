  and it still does n't changes the fact , that these 5 judges voted in by po , shortly before they were removed from power ( and they clearly knew about that ) , were n't voted in according to the law . 
  so it was also illegal . 
  now pis tries to do the same , but the opposition as well as foreign media ( since they have a huge interest in having po in power ) are literally demonising them . 
  it just is a complete shitshow . 
  also no , democracy in poland is ** not ** in danger . 
  again , this is just something which was amplified by the opposition . 
  i wonder if po did n't illegaly ellect those judges , this mess would n't have happened . 
  well , maybe because they are indeed hypocrites for supporting po and opposing pis . 
  especially with such bs reasons like `` our democracy is in danger '' . 
  sorry , but that 's not the applicable to the current situation . 
  it is more like : you took a shit in my garden , i will take a shit in your garden . 
  so in the end the situation is pretty clear . 
  and it is very clear that democracy in poland is ** not ** in danger . 
  unlike many medias say ... 
  it is actually quite the shitshow in the media , which could be put into one house with rt. 
  i still do n't understand those people who burn plastics and other garbage to keep their houses warm ... 
  these things are toxic as hell . 
  was n't there a law in effect to prevent such ? 
  also some cities are in really bad geographical locations , where the same air just keeps over the city . 
  but are n't there more important matters ? 
  terrorism for example ? 
  for me it seems very similiar to the bullshit as the ban of old light bulbs . 
  i miss those , since they were cheap and were n't toxic . 
  so i hope they wo n't do that . 
  and actually this is one of the reasons why i absolutely hate the eu . 
  these are internal affairs , the eu should n't dictate countries what to do . 
  you did nothing wrong , except if you are interested in a rebuilt city and how it looked before ww2, 
  or maybe you are the `` wehraboo '' ? 
  also please , look into some history books , well i wo n't defend him , but it was one of his advisors , who suggested it . 
  soviets liked to boast about their `` superior leader '' . 
  just like the germans about hitler . 
  at least hitler knew of strategy , stalin did n't , so he ordered many soldiers to die . 
  calling something after a mass murderer is already enough . 
  stalin was the opposite of educated . 
  liberum votum in the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the downfall would make a good drama, 
  us was taking part in the budapest memorandum as well as the uk and russia , which said that ukraine has to give up its nuclear arsenal and then ukraine will be recognized as a country . 
  oh and its souvereignity will be defended ... 
  yes they are , but i would count it as 2 invasions , since they did n't happen over the same time . 
  and also because the russians used a different tactic in the donbass then in crimea . 
  actually only after the two failed ceasefires . 
  but even then they do n't have that much impact like those for crimea . 
  there is a certain article , from a certain military alliance , where certain countries are members of it . 
  we also deserve to be defended in case of war . 
  having nuclear weapons may make us a target , but at the same time protect us from future aggressions . 
  although on the other hand i do n't think it is the right way to go . 
  nato bases would have been enough to protect us from potential aggression . 
  i do n't really want to have anything nuclear in my country . 
  it is something , which mankind still ca n't control . 
  no , the sanctions were for occupying crimea . 
  but not for attacking ukraine . 
  does n't really apply here . 
  po appointed 3 new members , pis now wants to get rid of them , since it did n't really go according to law . 
  but do n't forget , that po messed with it , just when they left . 
  pis is trying to revert it . 
  oh and po did n't do that ? 
  where was the outrage about that ? 
  probably a well planned strategy to keep control and discredit pis . 
  meanwhile , the media in germany talks of poland as if a new hitler is coming there . 
  it seems like we are the pure evil now . 
  although this government just reverts the changes the predecesor made . 
  and there we go again . 
  who did it this time ? 
  schr\u00f6der is n't here now . 
  at least it does not look like monopoly money . 
  tusk and his partypo lost power in our last elections . 
  wow you are really ignorant . 
  learn some polish history , then you will know why we are still hostile to russia , while russia is still the same being hostile to us . 
  finally . 
  now we only need an international investigation , which wo n't get fooled by russia 's fake recordings . 
  and i hope we will be able to force russia to finally hand over that wreck including the original blackbox , since these are polish property . 
  edit : also something interesting : the russian media immediately came up with the theory of crew/passangers being drunk and forcing the pilot to land . 
  and while these investigations are commited , nothing can be closed out . 
  you may say whatever you want , but i suspect sabotage as in a bomb or something else . 
  and this is what for me stands for too much capitalism . 
  the government needs to be most powerful authority . 
  no company should be able to bully it , companies are n't representing people , while governments are ( or at least most of them ) . 
  so the actions from pis , which made it harder for foreign companies to lay down there , were actually required to stop the continuation of poverty and reverse the flow of the money to the people instead of the companies . 
  poland is n't a puppet state of russia anymore . 
  we have gained our independence after being backstabbed twice . 
  so the question is : does russia really think they can still order us around ? 
  they have lost their power and we are in charge of our own country . 
  also some of the soviet monuments are being brought into museums , just to remember the `` freedom '' the soviets brought to us . 
  and i state the soviets , meanwhile the soviet soldiers indeed freed us ( although that is also disputable ) . 
  so in the end . 
  are we then allowed to tell russia to stop falsifying history ? 
  to stop saying the soviets `` liberated '' us ? 
  i will oppose the governments actions if they are threatening press freedom . 
  but the journalist was working inside a public tv station , belonging to the government . 
  if he was working in a commercial tv station and be banned from doing any kind of journalism , then that would be obviously a violation of the law . 
  as long as state-owned media is n't the only media in a country , it is n't censorship . 
  ( well with some obvious exceptations , but i 'm too lazy to list all of them ), 
  remember , that it was actually a minority there , who supported this . 
  also in crimea most people were flown in , when the russian army invaded it , just to make them settle there and participate in the questionable `` referendum '' . 
  in addition , i think , that it is quite possible , that russia will advance further into ukraine , since the population there has enough of this non-sensical war . 
  source ? 
  actually , he has a reason to be caring about what 's going on in the occupied regions of ukraine , since he is living in ukraine and it has an impact onto the whole of ukraine . 
  and do n't forget who invaded ukraine , russia . 
  makes sense , but is it true ? 
  let 's just hope , we wo n't get sold by the west once again and actually noone gets sold by them . 
  how ?
