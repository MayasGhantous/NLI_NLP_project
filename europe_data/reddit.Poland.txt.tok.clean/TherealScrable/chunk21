  but there wrre also russians/soviets or just communist . 
  poland did n't only fight fascism , but communism again . 
  for us the war ended in 1989 , because someone had to sell us to the russians . 
  and even the ak fought against more then 1 faction . 
  for once there were the german forces , then there was upa and then some `` people 's underground army '' , which was a soviet fake `` ressistance '' . 
  so no , the `` nazis '' were n't our only enemy . 
  it turned out well for us 45 years after the war , because of a little `` extra '' from our `` allies '', 
  and even worse for us : as a big `` thank you '' from the west our country.w assold to the russians , who executed anyone who was fighting in the red army so imo poland is obliged to nothing . 
  they helped us so much , that you were n't even able to celebrate victory . 
  article hidden behind a paywall , ca n't read it . 
  i think we will help , but only to a certain extent , since we have a vicious neighbour in the east , already chewing on an another neighbour . 
  well . 
  the only time when we were n't was in world war ii . 
  the western betrayal . 
  just wanted to point that out . 
  well , that was a nice use to correct the mistake po did . 
  i hope it continues like that and that these attacks will actually have some impact onto the handling of the huge influx of migrants . 
  closing the border is n't only about securing the border , but also about deporting illegals . 
  also your reference to the berlin wall is very unfitting . 
  the berlin wall was built to keep people ** in ** . 
  what we are doing is to keep people ** out ** . 
  since it involved a nato memberstate and there could have been sensible data as well as the polish ** president ** , poland has every right to demand it back immediately and then demand an international investigation . 
  and international does n't mean eu only . 
  well , the only thing i want to know , is what happened there . 
  everything 's possible . 
  that 's why demanding an international investigation would be the best idea . 
  i 'm not a conformist , who needs his views confirmed . 
  but i suspect an asassination . 
  which is completely based on the official investigation , which is actualy still not closed . 
  oh yes yes , russia saved us in 1939 . 
  but from whom ? 
  calling everyone who opposes you `` mental cases '' is just the way to go . 
  you actually seem like a troll . 
  get the hell out of here . 
  maybe you should see a psychologist , before you start to discredit those , who demand an objective investigation , which is our right . 
  you just show your ignorance and idiocity . 
  you must be a special one . 
  he is n't a scape goat , but that guy who only was pm to follow merkel 's orders to get into the eu parliament . 
  also he was the one who agreed to this causing this mess we have today . 
  there is a good reason to believe that . 
  kaczinsky was a harsh critic of russia , who even managed to bring all the post-communistic countries together to protest against the russian invasion of georgia . 
  also i did n't really care about macierewicz , but there was also a different investigation which came to the conclusion , that something is wrong about the official version . 
  so you have access to everything in this `` investigation '', 
  russia was n't in poland in 1943 . 
  and there would be too much pressure for russia . 
  keep in mind that the soviet union had no nuclear bombs in 1945 . 
  because enforcing something automatically means a new world war ... 
  and this one tops it off . 
  your comment is pretty stupid . 
  or maybe there was something else , then the `` official version '' , which can be only proven partially . 
  the wreckage was left in open field , many people stole parts from it and i would n't be surprised if in the end it was a bomb in the plane . 
  oh yes , compare it to this , because it is the same ... 
  or maybe you are one of those arrogant idiots , who think that everything the russians say is true ? 
  why trolling ? 
  he is right . 
  we do n't know the truth , only those involved know it . 
  and in 1943 it also was n't an accident and it turned around all of the tables , sikorski would have been able to stop the western betrayal . 
  that was just because of tusk . 
  oh how do you want to know that ? 
  maybe it was indeed a smuggled bomb ? 
  or it was shot down ? 
  possibilities are endless and i do n't trust the russians . 
  especially with their very fast mind reading , that the crew was drunk . 
  that was really disgraceful and just sick . 
  it will prove whatever it will . 
  sure thing is , that something is n't right here , otherwise russia would n't hold it back . 
  only sue ? 
  i hoped we would go even further in demanding an international investigation . 
  maybe to discredit us ... 
  but actually they said , they will return it , if the investigation of the `` accident '' in 2010 gets closed . 
  but we still want to investigate it so ... 
  they have to give it to us anyways . 
  they are probably hiding something . 
  either it crashed or something was n't right . 
  i expect the latter one . 
  they forgot monaco and indonesia, 
  it is always your fault , filthy americans . 
  this makes no sense ... wow , people support the single currency they have ... well over here , we still like our pln . 
  i 've missed it , did someone take a screenshot ? 
  well , but still geographically we see europe between the atlantic and the urals . 
  so v4 is pretty much the centerpoint of it . 
  i would just say , we are europe , meanwhile to our west , that is western europe and to our east , it is eastern europe . 
  oh look , there are cultural borders , too . 
  i guess in russia , everyone with some power wants to censor the internet . 
  well actually everyone with some power wants to censor the internet . 
  and i have a fairly high opinion of kaczynski . 
  also if he starts to ally himself to russia ... well , say goodbye for him , because nobody will accept that . 
  reread my comment to make sure , that there was no `` n '' behind russia ... 
  i do not see the problem . 
  putin is doing many absurd things and he is with much probability an enemy . 
  unknown . 
  first we have actually to see the wreck ... of course russia does n't want to give it to us . 
  as long as kaczynski wo n't ally with russia like orban did . 
  they are angry about this , meanwhile they say `` drunk pilot/general/president '' when a polish plane crashed in smolensk . 
  should n't we be furious about this , too ? 
  but actually , charlie hebdo was never good . 
  there was just a small spark because they were the target of a terrorist attack , that 's all . 
  does n't make them good . 
  it may do . 
  maybe there are much less idiots on your independence day or at least your media is n't that sensational .
