  military capabilities are very important . 
  i wo n't repeat myself again . 
  you must be ready for war to remain at peace . 
  easy as that . 
  and there is always a risk of war , so you are overexaggerating . 
  more people will know about the problem ... also you ignored the other things , i 've told you . 
  why wo n't you provide any arguments to support your position ? 
  well , that problemthing is actually something what the communists mostly did . 
  at least in our country . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  instead you would be obedient to that country , which may target you next , right ? 
  i think you have a lot to learn about the price of freedom and independence . 
  we poles had paid too much to have it taken away again without any ressistance . 
  and it does something . 
  it gives that more attention , the more you talk about it . 
  also calling him `` populist '' is enough for me , to say that you are very biased about the things in poland . 
  do you maybe read theguardian ? 
  i do n't even know your nationality . 
  but you seem to really lack knowledge of politics . 
  ah , so he is one of those old communists . 
  creating problems on his own and then trying to solve them ... that reminds me of something . 
  you are wrong . 
  ukraine is a neighbour of poland . 
  so it does matter to us . 
  it would also matter to you , if some country near yours was attacked . 
  you would do the same . 
  but well , some people may be far too lazy and lack the knowledge , what that and that could mean . 
  and you seem to miss the point . 
  you should be always ready to defend yourself . 
  especially with such a country as russia on your doorstep , when it is actually invading a neighbour already . 
  i 've ** never ** said , that russia would pick a fight with nato . 
  they would only pick a fight , if nato was lacking defensive capabilities , which they luckily do not ... anymore . 
  so next time , please stop with your dumb bias and actually start to think , what i could mean by that . 
  defending does n't necessarily means war , a `` cold war '' is far more likely . 
  well , i 've only heared something about that once . 
  so i have no idea who does and says what . 
  just one thing : nordstream, 
  are you implying that i am some crazy conspiracy theorist ? 
  you seem to not even know the current events . 
  and how do you want to know that ? 
  i will accept what the future will bring . 
  lithuania , a baltic nation , with whom we had a union , creating one of the most powerful empires in europe . 
  still , no same sex . 
  so in this case my point stays . 
  same sex couples ca n't provide new life . 
  from russia . 
  what else ? 
  not really . 
  it is needed , since russia is going places again . 
  we have to take a hard stance against them . 
  i would n't even consider them now as allies . 
  they may be temporary allies , but not really trustworthy . 
  and yes , it is true that the us is n't that good of a `` friend '' in these matters , but in my opinion they are the most trustworthy . 
  my definition and from many other , is that marriage is a bond between a man and a woman . 
  it stands for life . 
  same sex marriage would disaprove this meaning . 
  in addition to that , i would say , that you also get less taxes , for being married , and therefore being somehow useful for the state , providing more workers . 
  i know , there are some countries , which introduced some from of `` bond '' , which has the same benefits as marriage , which seems pretty non-sensical to me , since there are no benefits for the state and for others . 
  at the same time , what would same sex marriages change in that case ? 
  also to your question , i do n't know . 
  i 'm not able to answer it . 
  also again , there is a biological barrier . 
  so absolute `` equality '' is n't possible . 
  well , i do n't know . 
  but to me it seems that you are little less friendlier with poles then with others . 
  looking at the polish minorities in your southeastern regions . 
  because there is naturally a barrier . 
  two men nor two women can be married to each other . 
  it was always one man and a woman , which would also provide a healthy environment for a child as well as actually the possibility of a child . 
  and about this . 
  i do n't know what to say about that . 
  it is just bad , for me it violates the meaning of marriage . 
  vodka is russian , filthy russophobes !, 
  one thing which bothers me . 
  `` his disdain for tusk was heightened by the smolensk air disaster , which investigators have blamed on undertrained pilots trying to land the plane in dense fog . 
  kaczy\u0144ski and his supporters accuse tusk and his government of complicity in a cover up . '', 
  this air desaster is still not properly investigated . 
  the case is still open and the wreckage is ** after almost 5 years ** still in russian hands . 
  the russians also said , that they will only give the wreckage back to poland when the case has been closed , so further investigation would be impossible . 
  good thing that po is n't that traitorous . 
  also i do n't think he will do much of a revenge against the `` killing '' of his twin brother . 
  but he is indeed the actual one , who is in power . 
  that may be a good thing , or a bad thing . 
  but i think duda will prevent him from doing anything really stupid . 
  since duda seems very capable of being a president ... 
  unlike a certain komorowski , who just spread shame on poland . 
  did n't i saw this report on theguardan already ? 
  or maybe it was cnn . 
  i do n't know . 
  but the germans were never our allies and russia was actually almost everytime our enemy . 
  our closest ally is still the us . 
  ps : theguardian is very biased on this matter , ignoring many facts . 
  yay for lobbyists and eurocrats . 
  nah , there the op asked which country is our favorite and which our least favorite . 
  probably because in lithuania they have something against poland . 
  same sex marriage ... 
  here goes our meaning of marriage, 
  then there is nothing to do about it . 
  the only thing which i wanted to make sure is , that in poland there is no russophobia ... that 's russian propaganda . 
  we only have something against people , who think they are above all .
