  this is the world we live in . 
  and the world is complicated as always . 
  oy you racis . 
  bennd for 2 months ... ^ ^ ^ ^ if_this_was_posted_in_august_2015, 
  how did i miss this ? 
  this seems like a very acurate depiction of what is happening right now ... 
  except it is only about the `` old europe '' . 
  do n't forget that you also must have concentration camps and are literally hitler . 
  we are above animals . 
  meanwhile this is actually indeed interesting . 
  although twins could influence one another or by the parent . 
  in this case , i would categorize it as a mental illness . 
  and since i know it will offend someone , maybe not you , please do n't feel offended . 
  never intruded anyone 's life . 
  marriage is n't even a right . 
  it is something for couples , a man and a woman . 
  yeah , i am obviously trolling . 
  you can clearly see that by my hardline stance . 
  again , it is not a right . 
  otherwise marriage could also include that you may marry as well as yourself . 
  also what will gay couples give the government ? 
  nothing !, 
  then please tell me , how is one supposed to be born as a homosexual ? 
  as i said , the chance counts . 
  at least there is a possiblity of children . 
  unlike with homosexuals . 
  well , then tell me , where is the borderline ? 
  what about marrying animals ? 
  or even marrying furniture ? 
  it would have the same effect as gay marriage , it would be absolutely non-sense . 
  and gay people still have equal rights , just marry someone else , problem solved . 
  you are n't born gay . 
  you are made gay . 
  either by yourself , because of some beliefs or some different way . 
  their issues were never attended , because their issues are ridiculous . 
  all what they need is in poland and there was never a need for any protest , because homosexuality was always legal . 
  homosexuals are n't even discriminated , although if this trend continues the fronts will harden and discrimination could happen . 
  what they are asking for on this website is some leftist-green-hippy-bullshit . 
  it is actually quite outrageous to see such demands . 
   hate speech law ( gender identity ) for the sepcial snowflakes who need a safespace ? 
   no gender identity disorder diagnosis/psychological opinion required no compulsory medical intervention required no compulsory surgical intervention required what the hell are they even asking for ? 
  in all seriousness , this is absolute non-sensical garbage , just like same-sex marriage . 
  well , i am going ahead and will tell you that i identify as an attack helicopter . 
  there is a possibility for them and those who ca n't , it was n't their fault to be born that way . 
  wow , this is just going full social justice . 
  and what benefit do they bring to the society ? 
  well , for what right are they * rightfully * fighting for ? 
   given the legal rights they deserve yeah right ... 
  they '' '' `` deserve '' '' '' it . 
  i guess it is obligatory for everyone to see every homosexual as a god , otherwise it is oppression oyh ney !, 
  or maybe you are the bigots who ca n't accept anything and think everything has to be equal , although it is n't . 
  or you are the ones to be embraced and whatever . 
  nope , wo n't work on poland , you poor little gays , who throw around the word `` homophobe '' for nor reason and are even calling other homosexuals opposing gay marriage homophobic . 
  also what exactly do you benefit by having a `` gay marriage '' ? 
  and they keep protesting . 
  it wo n't change anything . 
  somewhere else then poland . 
  well it already happened . 
  activism will only worsen it . 
  this was also in direct relation to the quote above . 
  one thing is , that gay marriage is against the polish constitution and nothing will change this since the majority of the polish population is still sane and wo n't allow some gays to marry . 
  homosexuals are n't supposed to marry . 
  also the next level will probably be to give them children . 
  yeah right . 
  as if that ever happens here . 
  no , but there is a line on the laws of the marriage that it can only happen between a ** man ** and a ** woman **, 
  it was specially a response to that line from the article i have cited above . 
  you may protest as i said , but do n't rub it into people 's faces . 
  also marriage is a thing between a ** man ** and a ** woman ** . 
  there is ** no ** place for gays in there and it is also against our constitution . 
  also gays are n't equal to heterosexuals . 
  and they wo n't recieve the same things heterosexuals recieve . 
  seriously , they should be happy to live in a country , which allowed people to do whatever they want for a far longer time then the west did . 
  says the socialist . 
  `` now we have simply decided to end the softly-softly approach and call for full marriage rights . 
  we are not even talking to the politicians . 
  we are addressing ordinary people . 
  we want them to get used to it . '' yeah , right ... `` rising hostility '' . 
  maybe gay people are n't meant to marry and actually provide no advantages to the state . 
  and if you are going to rub it into people 's faces , no wonder `` hostility '' is rising , because noone likes to have something rubbed in their faces . 
  be happy that you are actually allowed to protest and to say that you are gay since pretty much the creation of the polish state . 
  seriously , just because we do n't embrace you , it does n't mean we oppress you . 
  do something useful . 
  nobody even cares about you , since your issues you have are actually non-existent . 
  they should start seeking attention in western europe , it wo n't work here . 
  edit : i am tired of arguing . 
  if you ca n't accept someone opposing your apparent `` values '' or more like opinions , then i do n't know . 
  create a safespace for yourselves or something . 
  by the way , i see these downvotes as bonuspoints for succesfully standing my ground . 
  even when some people actually started to say that i am `` trolling '' . 
  ^ no_i_am_obviously_sitting_in_the_kreml_being_a_shill ... people these days ... 
  russia was dominant in the ussr ... 
  but congratulations anyway , i guess ? 
  no , some leftist disagreed with me and called me immediately a nazi . 
  never said that . 
  no , i will just accuse you of being narrow-minded and ignorant . 
  the russians were a far greater threat all of the time . 
  and they still are , over a thousand years . 
  ( well maybe less , but it sounded so good ), 
  oh right ... just because i believe in one thing , it must be that i also believe everything else to fit a stereotype .
