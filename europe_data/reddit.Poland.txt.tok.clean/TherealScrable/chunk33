  the reasons for the partitions were different ... 
  the empires around the polish lithuanian commonwealth saw the government type itself already as a threat to themselves . 
  finally someone who is actually sane . 
  thank god . 
  seriously , everyone say that nationalism is bad and i tell you , that my country would n't have existed without nationalism . 
  the ones who are at least partially fascist are the leftists , trying to silence the public with either ridiculous rules or `` political correctness '' . 
  by the amount of people being in some `` stasi documents '' i guess they just had documents about everyone . 
  although the traitor letter did n't happen to us ... well , how should one be a traitor to someone , if he never was an ally of him , but instead wants independence ? 
  my father actually had about 300 pages of collected information by msw . 
  the `` polish stasi '' if you want to say so . 
  ( we had to leave because of that otherwise who knows what the bolsheviks would have done ), 
  i would n't have said it if i did n't read it ... 
  it is hard to look it up since the article is pretty old already . 
  ca n't find it anymore . 
  try to search for merkel opposing permament nato bases in poland . 
  it has to be from last year . 
  pis is everything bad . 
  literally hitler and literally stalin and literally darth vader . 
  oh where ? 
  if you had followed politics you would knew from who ... merkel . 
  left-wing populists are n't any better . 
  seriously , you seem pretty misinformed on many matters and are just repeating the same things the leftist media is talking about . 
  and the funniest thing , they did n't even want to let the us troops move on to the new nato front ... 
  it seriously depends on who you ask . 
  people who have some interests in politics will tell you , that this victory could n't have been greater . 
  but it is actually true that most people , pis and po voters alike and especially those who do n't vote at all hold the belief that it will be just another idiot ruling the country . 
  still quite sickening that one would shoot its own citizens for escaping the country ... 
  thank you russia . 
  ( russia because they really seem to have liked the good old stalin days ) my family also had to escape poland ( which was easier ) , since my father did something to become a target of some communist investigations . 
  my information may not be up to date about farage , since i dismissed him immediately , but [ this is where i got it from ] ( http://www.ukipmeps.org/articles_879_nigel-farage-stop-playing-wargames-in-ukraine.html ) although i am not certain what exact video of him it was , but it was from 2014 , after russia invaded ukraine . 
  probably the majority of people . 
  nigel farage was very supportive of russian action in ukraine . 
   right wing populist propaganda i 'm sorry ? 
  far-right or right wing ? 
  there is a difference , you know . 
  which is quite weird ... actually why ? 
  both suffered the horrors of soviet imperialism . 
  in our country only the far left is supportive of russia . 
  our rightwing is hating russia even more then our `` centre-right '', 
  which is sad ... 
  but again , it is only the western european right-wing ... and in case i would n't even call them rightwing . 
  i know ... 
  but still , there is a paywall , even though the `` first page free '' . 
  also private mode does n't work . 
  paywall ... ca n't see anything . 
  i am sorry to tell , but it is indeed propaganda for the enemy to report from the `` pro-russian seperatist '' side . 
  it is clearly mainly a conflict between ukraine and the russian military inside ukraine . 
  they have nothing to do there . 
  and it is actually understandable that ukraine does not let the information flow free in its country at ** wartime ** . 
  every country does that ... 
  primarily to repell the foreign enemy in this case the majority is foreign . 
  only a minority of `` ukrainian ethnic russians '' are helping these bandits . 
  war reparations which should have been given to china , which suffered the most . 
  it would have probably went like it went for the ukrainians . 
  they were promised everything and then betrayed ... 
  although with pilsudski i believe he would also stab them into their own back before they can stab them into their back . 
  no , i am `` another ridiculous pole '' who argues that teheran was a betrayal ... a big sold out to the russians and the exclusion of the then-president-in-exile sikorski , who later on died mysteriously in an plane crash in gibraltar 1943 . 
  the british and french had the power to destroy germany . 
  actually pilsudski recommended to pre-emptively invade germany in 1933 , but the french declined for reasons , we also see today if it is about the ukrainian conflict . 
  the west then was delusioned and thought ww2 was never possible , the west today is also delusioned about many things . 
  #but this does n't change that britain and france betrayed poland in not providing help !, 
  seriously , if you make promises , you should stick to them and not just search excuses . 
   poland could hold out for long and they felt the defensive positions in france were more then favourable . 
  funfact , poland held out for longer then france did ( beginning with the first part of occupied territory ) ... 
  seems like they really * favored * the * defense * positions in france . 
  it is also called `` danzig or war '' . 
  why not just call the whole region gdansk ? 
  i know , that it was about that corridor . 
  but also about the city itself , which a city under the control of the `` un '' ... forgot the name . 
  stalingrad was n't even close to the destruction warsaw saw . 
  neither did czechoslovakia really do hobbit policy . 
  they hoped for help from the allies , in the end they were sold out just like poland . 
  btw , they had actually closer relations to the soviets . 
  i do know , that is why i was talking about the cause of polish inaction when the first two partitions happened . 
  actually , if pilsudski would have lived long enough , i could have seen a german-polish alliance possible ... as long as hitler did n't demand gdansk of course . 
  but the older plans were to invade germany before they even built up an army in 1933 with the help of france . 
  of course , france did n't want to participate . 
  that was actually because of a certain law making the king powerless and the whole country just stagnating . 
  city centers ... 
  but what i am talking about is a whole city , which was the biggest city in that country and was completely annihilated by the poor , bombed germans from then . 
  one could n't care less about the destruction of your opponnent , who firstly started the war and secondly destroyed your cities systematically as well as systematically put your population into concentration camps ... not only jews were targeted . 
  nvm , it was over 90 % warsaw was systematically destroyed by the germans in 1944 in and after the uprising . 
  laying fires and demolishing buildings , no matter if historical or not . 
  they have also tested new weapons like the sturmtiger i believe . 
  well , certainly they have used the ` schwerer gustav ' to bomb the city . 
  i thought it was even higher , but i was n't certain and i was too lazy to look it up . 
  better then communist houses , which were already falling apart when they were being built . 
  pssst warsaw was the conventionally most destroyed big city in the whole of world war ii . 
  over ~ ~ 70 % ~ ~ 90 % of the city was destroyed . 
  and also poland lost the biggest percentage of its population , because of german and soviet occupation . 
  of course you can rebuild a city , you must rebuild your city . 
  still , heritage gets lost ... 
  the germans and soviets were actively plundering ... 
  although the soviets were n't doing it in warsaw i believe ... 
  except for literally stealing whole factories . 
  or maybe you should get less dependent on an enemy ... 
  except if you want to do molotov-ribbentropf again . 
  it is a broken ceasefire and the minsk ** 2 ** agreement is garbage and is n't fullfilled by anyone . 
  and actually it was immediately broken with the attack on debaltseve . 
  as i said , russia is attacking .
