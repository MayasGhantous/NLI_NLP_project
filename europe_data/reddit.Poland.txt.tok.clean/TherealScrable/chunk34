  there is a decent sized russian army in eastern ukraine . 
  throw it into the garbage can , throw the garbage can into an even bigger garbage can , light it on fire , strip the remains to a rocket and send it to the sun ... and send a nuke after that just to be sure . 
  edit : oh you want consequences ? 
  `` use '' = less control , centralized government acting in only its own interests , lots of unrest , very slow , impossible because of cultural reasons , impossible because of the very different mentality of every nation , supernation would end independence we fought for ( pretty much self-inflicted damage ) also in case it happens , let 's call it germany for the old good times . 
  let 's unite all slavic people under one banner ... * the russian one * i believe pan-slavism is a terrible idea . 
  seriously , we have almost nothing in common with russians and others . 
  maybe our neighbours are a little bit more similiar but then they are different again . 
  so no , it just does n't exist . 
  in this case i do n't care . 
  chechnya was also full of warcrimes done by russia . 
  nobody cared there neither because it is a war . 
  no surprise that big cities get bombarded , especially when the enemy is hiding in those in war . 
  well ... answering to a comment which is answering to a comment denying russian involvement makes one think that you also deny it . 
  but what is the point of telling this ? 
  what makes this event so special in a ** war ** ? 
   almost all of the civilians who died in the conflict did so under ukrainian artillery strikes . 
  this is an obvious lie . 
  both sides did heavy bombardments , although the russians did more then the ukrainians ... and they actually invaded ukraine . 
  the ukrainian government did some pretty bad stuff to their own military . 
  but they did n't underreport anything . 
  by april 2015 the number of deaths was about 6 thousand . 
  and actually the russians like to report their losses as just missed in action , because somehow they are still successful lying to their population , that this war is done by local farmers with modified tractors . 
  for me the whole german government is pretty bad at its job . 
  you do know that russia incited this `` civil war '' ? 
  i have never seen terrorists being so organized that the first thing they do is to occupy media buildings . 
  also all of those russian tanks we can see there are evidence for russian involvement , maybe 20 % of them are captured , but most of them are from russia, 
  yes , the gema is also a big problem . 
  but i was also talking about some blocking of certain things , which they consider hate speech ... actually reading an article from die welt , it seems like the government wants to introduce active censorship for the reason of having to deal with `` incitements of hatred '' . 
  and some politicians from the spd also want to fully destroy anonymity in the internet , by requiring users to log in using their real-life names and using personal ids to identify themselves . 
  meanwhile in germany : `` let 's build another gaspipeline making us even more dependent on russian gas ! '', 
  seriously , most people think the war in ukraine is over , since the media always talks about some sort of `` cease-fire '' and germany and france try to force it upon ukraine , no matter if russia is attacking . 
  why ? 
  what makes you think they are `` underreporting '' their losses ? 
  also civil war ? 
  really ? 
  more like `` led by putin '' . 
  i did n't saw any reaction on when poland recognized it as a genocide ... well ... whatever . 
  the next day everyone will forget about it as it is with everything else . 
  well ... 
  some of them may be used to just let your anger out . 
  especially when the same country which has put them up is now attacking you . 
  tell that germany . 
  they actually love to block content in the internet . 
  some people say this article says something wrong ... 
  although i ca n't see anything wrong with it . 
  it just tells you it is there and that 's it . 
  of course , many people are ignorant of the russian threat , since they are n't bordering a country being ravaged by russian troops . 
  or they just are paranoid of the new polish government ... 
  which is really , really weird . 
  just laugh it off . 
  they are the ones living in a cave , while we are walking outside and seeing the reality . 
  if you mean journalists by that . 
  well yes , the west likes to pay a lot ... or at least the directors , which have a leftist mindset pay them for making articles they consider `` neutral '' or `` objective '' . 
  although the situation in russia is far worse . 
  no , you wo n't be flooded with migrants for choosing that side . 
  and actually inside that side there is a second side and then there is another division and the list goes on . 
  if your government says no , what will germany do about it ? 
  nothing . 
  meanwhile it is indeed possible . 
  you should prepare always for the worst-case scenario , you may say it is madness that russia would ever invade poland , but look at what they are doing in latvia . 
  they sterring up the russian minority over there , which could provoke a war . 
  and this would be all russia 's fault . 
  also let 's get back to 2012 . 
  say , ukraine is still having very friendly relations with russia , now ask that question again about ukraine : `` this is madness !, 
  how could anyone ever think of russia invading ukraine ? '' ... 
  and here we are . 
  russia invaded ukraine . 
  and a plan for that existed for over 10 years . 
  so , no . 
  this arming up because of russia 's aggressive and imperialistic behaviour is fully justified . 
  well there are some . 
  but what sense does this make ? 
  and it is highly unlikely that a unitied european army will ever happen , it will ** never ** happen . 
  from past experience you can already tell , that you would be just given up for cheaper gas prices . 
  it does n't matter . 
  if a scenario where russia attacks the baltics should occur , we have to be prepared , unlike western europe . 
  i like how chernobyl is yellow . 
  did someone consider to move there for better air quality ? 
  so , let 's dip into this circlejerk and break it . 
  ( from past experience on this sub , i am fairly confident that downvotes will rain from people who are misinformed because of the smear campaign or are trying to push their agenda , as everyone does ) the eu is not in the position to criticize any country . 
  especially not against a ** democratically ** elected government , which is doing very poor damage control , which was caused by the previous government . 
  it certainly is not all pis 's fault , and neither are they the devil as the opposition supporters like to potray them . 
  but they did a good chunk of mistakes . 
  still , demanding that the government which promised to do that and that to stop doing that and that is just ridiculous . 
  i guess some people misunderstood the principles of democracy . 
  it is not your way , it is the majorities way . 
  oh right ... forgot that google bought youtube . 
  that 's the reason you should never support censorship in the internet . 
  well , hard times are upon us . 
  `` hate-speech '' i have nothing against censoring a certain type of it , but we all know , they will expand it and censor as much as possible . 
  wrong turn . 
  oh and it is `` just '' youtube , twitter , facebook and microsoft . 
  i am happy to not see google on this . 
  i only see a new reason for censorship with such rules . 
  always ? 
  this is actually surprising ... 
  but actually , who cares what you are ? 
  and i believe it should remain as it is . 
  no , you do n't get any benefits for being homosexual , no you do n't get your `` gay marriage '' , but yes , you are free to do what ever you like . 
  unlike what a certain group of people would want to see , where you `` embrace '' everything , but not you .
