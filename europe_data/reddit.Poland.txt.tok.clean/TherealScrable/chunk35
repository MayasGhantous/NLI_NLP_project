  oh how do you dare poland !, 
  * pis did it again !, 
  well , germans are known for their construction efficiency ... * airports *, 
  same here ... 
  but i was accused of that on this sub , / r/europe . 
  and that guy had also a polish flair , i guess nowadays you just call everyone shill , who disagrees with you , you shill . 
  as if pis needs to use such tactics, 
  because europe is a country . 
  and the best thing : more problems !, 
  and even ** bigger problems ** !, 
  also more corruption , less liberties , '' '' '' '' `` equality '' '' '' '' '' ** just nope ** if france wants to do such a thing , why wo n't they just do it with germany . 
  nobody else wants to be part of such a thing and give up its independence . 
  that 's an early warning system . 
  nothing about a missile defense . 
  yes, 
   they are openly portraying themselves as an enemy . 
  they are making themselves the enemy . 
  or how would you call someone who attacks you or does everything to provoke you ? 
  also , you are implying as if poland never was an enemy or target of russia ... oh you are wrong , if you only knew . 
  yes i said that , and your point being ? 
  the people following them are also responsible for their actions . 
  i did n't say that everyone who is a german is responsible forever for what happened . 
  i did say that the germans then were equally responsible for their actions . 
  there was only a tiny fraction which did n't follow the government , all the others just followed it . 
  and since they admitted they did wrong ( what the russians never actually did ) , everything is ok today . 
  that 's how it works , i know . 
  but whatever makes you support that one side and you then support that one side , which is the side of the aggressor , makes you a supporter of the aggressor . 
  no matter what . 
  no , you should have read that with a bored voice . 
  it is n't really surprising for me , since russia is known to treat everyone weaker then them like shit . 
  but doing that in such proximity to warsaw could have been considered an aggression . 
  because russia has imperialistic ambitions , see georgia and ukraine . 
  the current russian government is not to be trusted and they are openly portraying themselves as an enemy . 
  what kind of prophecy ? 
  i am waiting until they say , that we gas the trees . 
  there is surely a reason to blame this smear campaign on leftists ... 
  especially because there is a smear campaign happening in the media and these articles range from understandable fears to ridiculous paranoia . 
  and if the government did n't do anything , there would have been some other petition about saving the forest . 
  also only one part of the forest is ancient , what is being considered to be logged is some newer part still old , but not ancient to save the forest itself . 
  but sure , let 's continue with the smear campaign , because , why not ? 
  and as the germans were responsible for their actions so are the russians now and then ... ( stalin ), 
  there is one tiny problem ... 
  if russia wants to launch missiles at the usa , they will . 
  and the missile shield is at the wrong position to intercept those missiles , since russia 's missiles can just go over the north pole to the us . 
  so the concept of mad is not threatened at all . 
  and the missile shield wo n't be able to intercept missiles in time which target european locations . 
  they were ... 2009 russian nuclear military drills ? 
  they were practicing a nuclear attack on warsaw in belarus ... 
  oh right . 
  forgot about that . 
  bulgaria is in a superstate . 
  it exists in two opposite states simultaneously . 
  i am pretty sure , that the polish army was rather not supportive of the bolsheviks ... and vice versa . 
  went ahead to see it myself ... 
  completely different results : poles are ugly poland is the most important great britain is in university the british are delighted with the transformation of young polish woman ( wat ? ), 
  russia is in nato russians are op ( as in overpowered ... 
  in war thunder ... 
  why ? ), 
  seriously ... 
  this is weird . 
  but again ... maybe these results were caused by your search history . 
  i used the incognito tab to find these things . 
  so tell us , what kind of stuff are you searching on google ? 
  oh look how divided ukraine is !, 
  just as potrayed by western and russian media in 2014 !, 
  novorossiya is real !, 
  also the recommendation from russia to just partition ukraine is absolutely genius ... as genius as those who believe everything from sputniknews or rt. 
  wow ... and even there they want to sell our eastern part ... what is this map actually ? 
  it looks just dumb . 
  and it does . 
  western europe 's mainstream is centre-left , ours is centre-right to right-wing . 
  to a certain degree it is understandable . 
  these muslims coming from asia are also openly anti-semitic . 
  the misuse of the words `` far-right '' is still a problem , as you have admitted it yourself . 
  it makes it relative and in the end either the leftist achieve their goal in potraying everyone right to them nazis and fascists ( as the soviets did after ww2 ) or an actually far-right party gets called out as one , but noone does something about it , because the term is being overused . 
   there 's something wrong with uncontrolled immigration , lack of integration and allowing for wahhabism/salafism to spread . 
  oh ya fascist prorussian nazi !, 
  sarcasm aside , that is probably a party , which everyone would want . 
  and to me it seems like a normal centre party , not a left . 
  let 's be all communist together , comrade !, 
  although the pirate parties have actually potential ... 
  but only potential , they seem too naive to do anything . 
  when did i say that ? 
  actually i am kinda also sick of this kind of fear mongering . 
  give me the facts , not some `` could be '' bullshit . 
  centre-right , being centre-left in poland would prove to be difficult . 
  tell me again that afd , pis , svp and some others are :  open fascist , democracy-sceptic and neo-nazi you must be living inside a box . 
  well , seems like it is being used the wrong way all the time . 
  manipulation by the media , as always . 
  the iskander missiles were deployed in 2014 , when russia invaded ukraine and most countries condemned russia for doing so . 
  you do know , that russia stationed iskander rockets capable of delivering nuclear payload in kaliningrad ? 
  so why should we back down ? 
  what exactly is the difference between a party which is not populist and one that is ? 
  i ca n't make any sense from this . 
  is n't every party populist ? 
  right ... 
  i guess poland is a dictatorship now , which kills everyone who opposes it ? 
  maybe that 's why they let kod protest against the elected government for being `` wrongly-elected '' and doing bad at cleaning up the mess , the previous government left . 
  most of the german politicians , certainly . 
  i do n't know about the other ones .
