  but most of these `` centre '' parties . 
  it is leftist . 
  you can see a lot of similiarities with the soviet union and how it treated its subjects . 
  ( except the violence ), 
  she acts against her country . 
  she does some lefty stuff . 
  i guess there is much reason to think , that she is actually a leftist . 
  the cdu is pretty much as right as psl . 
  it is n't even far-right . 
  if you wanted to see far-right , you may look towards russia . 
  what are you actually calling far-right ? 
  also who is europe ? 
  you mean the naive western europe ? 
  europe is becoming fascist and they are evil and look how evil they are !, 
  they are eating little babies !, 
  if you ask me , i am sick of this fear mongering . 
  being right-wing does not equal to being hitler . 
  please do n't confuse the eu with nato . 
  nato is here to protect us . 
  also you are a very nice example of what i was talking about in my second part . 
  well , turkey will join the eu now , because of merkel 's secret deals with erdogan . 
  but they will probably join it , when everyone else leaves . 
  seriously , turkey has nothing in common with europe . 
  they only have a small bit of land in europe . 
  thank you merkel for selling the eu ... 
  in a good way actually . 
  now we can do an actual eu , which does n't intervene in internal affairs , because of electing `` the wrong party '' followed by `` muh , coup '' and `` muh , pro-putin '' as well as `` muh , dictator '', 
  they lowered the retirement age because 2 years earlier po raised it . 
  they wanted to revert that change and did so . 
  but i am thankful for an objective observer ( something rare here ) . 
  most people here are just circlejerking about how bad pis is and how good the `` liberals '' are . 
  populism is actually present in all parties . 
  i seriously do n't understand why only the right is called populist ... 
  well in our country `` nazi '' and `` fascist '' is received as an insult . 
  but with that you are also saying that you are a communist , since the communists used that a lot to describe the armia krajowa . 
  `` german-collaborators '' . 
  and nothing changed on the russian side , neither on the communist side . 
  both keep calling their enemies and those they disagree with nazis . 
  i wonder when russia will pay compensation for invading ukraine ? 
  it indeed is . 
  but there is a major problem , when the supreme court gets politicized by the former government just before the new government goes into power . 
  po meddled with it and now pis is doing a poor job with entangling it . 
  and the eu only makes it worse or actually the opposition , since it is the opposition which is screaming for a foreign intervention all the time . 
  also po is considered a centre-right conservative party . 
  pis is a right-wing conservative party . 
  we have only psl which could be considered `` liberal '' , which is a minor party and did n't even get into parliament . 
  actually no left-wing party got into the sejm this time . 
  i guess this is caused by the regular shitfights on the political level and the constitutional crisis caused by po , which could have also scared pis to loose power . 
  i believe pis is trying to do the same as po did , but they want to do it in just 1 year and they are doing a poor job at hiding it . 
  still , the democracy is there and it wo n't be abolished any time soon . 
  but normally nobody should invite outsiders to meddle with our internal politics . 
  it is a polish shitfight and it should remain one . 
  it is a smear campaign . 
  no matter what . 
  just as it was against poland when pis was elected . 
  meanwhile erdogan handled it very poorly . 
  which is where the problem is . 
  this reminds me more and more of the soviets . 
  what have nazis to do with today 's situation ? 
  go on eu . 
  go on alienating yourselves and making even very similar decisions as the communists did . 
  this will only go on and on with no end in sight . 
  or maybe the eu gets finally reformed from an interventionist supra-organization to an actual alliance . 
  not some delusional dream of a european supercountry . 
  actually , why not just invade poland ? 
  if you already step on our sovereignty and do n't care about our democracy as long as it is some `` liberal party '' ( since poland is very liberal full of liberal parties ( they get 2-8 % on average , wow ! ) ), 
  which is in elected , you may as well invade us militarily and ** just go full soviet ** . 
  it would be also legitimate since pis being ** elected ** is even worse then hitler . 
  look at all the people they have killed . 
  well , you got ta hold on to your job . 
  i did mean an incursion of some sorts . 
  but well , nothing for us to do here . 
  a leftist 's a leftist . 
  no matter what . 
  so leftist regime , communist regime , it is the same . 
  i would even add socialist regime to that . 
  also there would be a solution , but as always you have to solve the origin of the problem , which would involve a crisis for most people , which makes life for them even worse , but then far better . 
  it indeed is . 
  although actually it is n't ** that ** different . 
  you 've said it , they have tensions , inner tensions , which thereby they will be busy handling themselves . 
  and also , how are they supposed to attack a nato member ( well ok , they de-facto did it when they invaded cyprus ) . 
  although they are n't as crazy as the russians in this case . 
  turkey has proved to be more reasonable and less imperialistic then its neighbors . 
  otherwise you could say the same about greece , that greece is on the verge of conflict and they could demand constantinople back . 
  i also do not see any frustrations , except for the frustration of being misrepresented by the western media , because they have * that phase * again . 
  turkey wo n't be accepted into the eu , that is actually pretty clear . 
  what angela merkel did was irresponsible and in this case she took action almost like a totalitarian dictator . 
  and the agreement itself actually fell apart some weeks later , so we are at 0 again . 
  in the end only the poor turks want to migrate to europe . 
  if nationalism is so strong as you have said , then this should be the case . 
  and again , turkey in the eu is a highly unrealistic scenario , if it is without heavy consequences . 
  the eu would probably fall apart when turkey joins . 
  but what has this to do with the netherlands being threatened by turkey ? 
  this actually quite surprised me . 
  i hope the company using them gets a punishment for this . 
  i actually do not understand all of those people who try to defy the fact , that it is a better life for them . 
  you may say it is bad , because it is bad , but going from the worst to a little better is making the second option still a little better . 
  and no , i do not feel the need to defend my point , if someone gets somehow triggered by a fact . 
  socialist republics as puppet states of russia does n't equal to being the third republic . 
  so i believe it does make sense .
