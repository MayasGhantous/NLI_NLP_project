  oh right , because the opposition is being murdered , the police opens fire on protesters and russia is about to come in to help pis ... 
  this makes absolutely no sense , to compare this to mao and stalin . 
  i could also say : `` oh boy merkel is like hitler , because she is leading the eu hurrdurr '' same bs effect . 
  i completely respect that . 
  still , i have to ask . 
  why support russia ? 
  this was because of outside interference with the sejm and corrupting some nobles by giving them money or promising them something , if they veto that or that . 
  polish politics pretty much stagnated completely and the king was n't able to do anything , since the sejm blocked everything ... actually yes , the current situation is very similiar . 
  the polish court would have blocked everything pis would try to do and thus po succesfully dissolved it . 
  did you actually completely forget about the past and recent events ? 
  you seem to confuse your western right wing with polish conservative parties . 
  we rely mostly on nato and especially on the us . 
  russia is still an enemy and will remain an enemy until ** they ** change . 
  and it is more likely that po is more involved with russia then pis is . 
  especially since donald tusk seems to have done some weird stuff with putin . 
  meanwhile kaczinsky is supporting the independence of georgia and ukraine and a more hard-stance against russia . 
  po played the polish constitutional court to their own benefit , trying to block pis decisions . 
  thus pis degraded the cc , which makes pro-po alarmists and leftists cry about how much of a dictatorship poland now is . 
  that 's pretty much what po did to the polish cc . 
  pis only implemented counter-measures against possible blocks by the cc . 
  i suspect po of trying to try to make pis look like they are only populist , but now they made them look like literal fascists . 
  only problem is , that they are the ones . 
  it was a dilemma for pis , which could have been handled better , but now it is as it is . 
  this is the result if you try to use the cc as a political tool . 
  so you are basing your accusations on empty words . 
  well done !, 
  well , that 's sad then . 
  i thought they were supportive of democracy . 
  and in what way does it violate it ? 
   yeah and this `` po-majority '' court fix the situation by canceling nomination of two wrongly elected judges . 
  so there goes you claim that this court is po biased . 
  because removing 2 out of 5 wrongly elected judges , which replace judges elected by pis is `` fixing '' . 
  and just because 3 judges were elected with pis support meanwhile 9 others were elected by po is legitimatizing this cc . 
   and last but not least . 
  this is how the system works . 
  ruling party elect judges for 9 years and future governments needs to deal with that . 
  po had to rule with judges elected by pis too . 
  and now you do not like the system and your solution is just to ignore the law rather than change the system . 
  nope , that is ** not ** how it works . 
  po was at the end of the term and they were rushing their judges into the cc . 
  it was completely illegitimate . 
  but alright , i am the one apparently supporting to ignore law . 
  oh alright , then at what instances in history did it happen ? 
  again . 
  the current conflict between po/nowoczesna and pis is an internal affair , it is on a national level and thus not international . 
  if a neighbour gets threatened then it could be international . 
  actually i have to say that donald tusk tries to distance himself from these things . 
  he himself is actually against such interventionist policy of the eu . 
  this is a recent thing . 
  and you obviously do not know the history of poland . 
  actually poland played mostly the foreign powers . 
  pilsudski used the germans to create the 2nd polish republic . 
  polish legionaries , just an example . 
  the only bad thing which happened was the liberum votum . 
  it failed after members of the sejm were corrupted and involved with foreign powers . 
  corruption was the problem , not `` plz halp we dun lik or govermunt !, 
  this was the result of a certain thing po did just at the end of their term . 
  they inserted even more of their sympathizers into the constitutional court thus securing power in it and having the power to block everything pis wants to do . 
  this is politics . 
  you seem to lack common sense . 
  none of those determine a country 's politics and actually do not interfere into one . 
  the smolensk incident is still not properly investigated , russia is blocking it . 
  also the plane is polish property , so it makes poland an involved party and since this is on an international level , every party is free to call for outside help . 
  meanwhile internal affairs should be refrained to the country , outsiders interfering are ** never ** welcome . 
  the communist regime was n't representing poland , it was representing the soviet led communist poland . 
  and it was pretty much an occupation . 
  so that 's a completely different situation . 
  meanwhile pis is only trying to salvage what is left and tries to proceed as planned by also fullfilling their electoral promises , which the po-majority court would have fully blocked . 
  you do know , that it was po which disrupted the balance , causing this mess . 
  outside pressure will only unite people . 
  why should someone think that they would do such a thing ? 
  i am fairly certain they will do a better job then po ... also this whole constitutional crisis was caused by po . 
  there was a certain balance between pis and po , but it was disrupted by the end of their term . 
  also all those people who died in the smolensk incident were also replaced by po supporters . 
   european people 's party and the socialists and backed by the liberals and greens so we have managed to upset pretty much the whole left . 
  i guess we did a good work . 
  this is ridiculous and ** this ** is actually ** against ** democracy . 
  reminds me a lot of the soviets , where you were only able to vote for special picked out parties by the government , which were actually just one . 
  good thing that we still retain our real democracy unlike these european communists would like to . 
  good thing that the v4 will probably hold against such a absurd decision . 
  hypocrisy at its best !, 
  it would n't surprise me if the eu should indeed split apart . 
  i certainly can not deny that . 
  although the russian gas disputes were because most of europe made itself dependent on that gas . 
  but in the end we are dependent on each other . 
  isolation is the worst thing to happen in these times . 
  so yes you are right . 
  although i can not tell about the beginning of the 20th century . 
  it was more of an event sparking a big war . 
  geography is sometimes something which will hurt you , but sometimes also help you . 
  so well ... greece just did what was expected . 
  they did n't want to take the migrants so they let them go on . 
  now that the borders are closed they are piling up in greece , which is why there needs to be a stronger coast guard in the mediterranean . 
  although turkey does n't seem to suffer that much from syria 's instability . 
  the only thing which emerged with that was the kurds who now want their own country . 
  it is still minor though , at least at the moment . 
  and freedom is freedom . 
  you have the freedom to do the right thing , the freedom to success , or to fail . 
  this is actually something which i consider sovereign countries do . 
  we have always lived in a world of dominoes .
