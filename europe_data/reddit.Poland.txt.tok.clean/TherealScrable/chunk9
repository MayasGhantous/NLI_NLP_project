  being afraid to be called a nazi, 
  of course they will be different . 
  more extreme , more violent . 
  yeah , no need for that, 
  since the introduction of `` anti-hate-speech '' laws . 
  good thing we do n't have such a thing . 
  oh , i just saw an error in that map ... azerbaijan lost its southwestern territory to iran . 
  uhm no . 
  we are very different , especially culturally . 
  also we have different ideals , one of ours for example is freedom , which the russians are obviously missing . 
  and i mean freedom for everyone . 
  russia is only hated because it makes itself hated . 
  looking at smolensk 2010 , ukraine 2014 , georgia 2008 , the 45 years of soviet occupation , the glorification of stalin and the communists , regular military provocations ... 
  the list goes on . 
  tons of reasons why to hate russia . 
  meanwhile russian citizens ... 
  it depends if they are talking lots of shit and are disrespectful , viewing the world as if it was 1950 or if they are actually polite and friendly people . 
  well , ignorance ... as for myself , i see romanians as allies . 
  especially since they literally never had done anything in history against poland . 
  you should n't worry about some polls . 
  in the end most of them are n't accurate anyways . 
  i am actually also surprised to see romans so so low ... and also at the same time seeing the germans so high . 
  some fo those have a 101 % turn out , the chinese one has only 99 % if the author had to round the numbers so much , why even bother to also write a '' .0 '' behind each percentage ? 
  yes it is . 
  although i have never thought about it being rude . 
  is there was czech insult which goes with that - czycy ? 
  you know that the russians are very different from the polish , do you ? 
  also the worst part about this is that russia still praises its communist times as one of the best and one of the most murderous people as the best leader ... and by the way , under him more people died then under hitler ... and he lived at the same time when hitler came into power ... also another thing , he actually allied with hitler in the first part of ww2 ... 
  it was n't a non-aggression treaty . 
  the budapest memorandum was about those 5 countries recognizing ukraine and protecting its souvereignity if it gives up its nuclear arsenal . 
  and how are you going to tell anyone what is a bad decision and what is a good one ? 
  also the russians are known to shell your place , they did it in their invasion of donbass for example . 
  shelling the ukrainian army from their own territory . 
  so i do n't think anyone will just stop at the russian border , at the same time the russians will probably use nuclear weapons if there seems to be no chance of winning ... and i do not support appeasement policy neither do i support the usage and actual creation of nuclear weapons . 
   there would be more positive reception to russian control in eastern european countries huh wut ? 
  i actually have no idea which countries would appreciate another 45 years of russian occupation ... 
  except if merkel is blocking it . 
  * protect and these countries were : russia , uk , us , france , china, 
  well , there is a huge problem . 
  to stop russia you need to make them submit , so you will enter their territory and they will use nuclear weapons , if someone starts occupying their lands ... a major power of course . 
  and russia is for me shady af ... 
  oh boy , what a twist !, 
  it looked like you were trying to defend britain ... actually never thought of it , that you wanted to criticize churchill for that . 
  if that 's so , then i probably took something the wrong way . 
  and today nobody needs kresy , although historically it was the land of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth, 
  well , our plan was to preemptively strike germany in 1934 , but for that we needed the help of the french ... 
  they of course refused . 
  also everything was made according to the munich agreements , for which britain and france agreed for germany taking czechoslovakia ... 
  so hypocrisy at its best by churchill . 
  have nothing against disagreeing . 
  although why should the election have been faked or rigged ? 
  yes indeed they were . 
  you may search it in the archives of the interpreter . 
  they have a liveblog about it and are reporting about it since january 2014 . 
  oh right , because they were the leaders of then ... do you know actually what , nobody even knew about them becoming presidental candidates ... 
  so yeah , poroshenko did the coup , and i did 9/11 . 
  poroshenko was elected after the war started . 
  when did russia intervene ? 
  28th february 2014 . 
  the russian invasion of crimea , followed by a `` referendum '' approved by your local tinfoil wearer . 
  meanwhile in april 2014 something started brewing in eastern ukraine , interestingly enough administration centers were attacked and taken over , but what is especially interesting was that media buildings were also taken over and russian tv was played over them ... grandious strategy for hybrid warfare . 
  so even there it seems like russian speznaz or the fsb had its fingers in it . 
  now russia never officially intervened ... 
  even for western media , which is the most stupid thing to say . 
  russia invaded ukraine on august 2014 , when the supposed `` rebels '' led by a russian ex-general were removed from sloviansk and mariupol . 
  they almost lost to the ukrainian army and luhansk as well as donetzk were almost taken back , but then ilovoisk happened . 
  a major invasion by russian groundforces started , which includes the ilovoisk massacre . 
  russian troops were advancing across ukrainian territory until the current lines through 3 major offensives , breaking 2 cease-fires . 
  one in september , the other one in january ... actually also in february by constantly bombing debaltseve into ashes . 
  so these were 3 `` cease '' - fire violations . 
  the russian army played an active role in expanding occupied territory . 
  these are certainly not `` rebels '' . 
  i am also sick and tired of your shit . 
  you call them ** black-and-white ** ?? 
  from what i can see , they are pretty much diverse enough to even consider some of them as pro-russian ... 
  especially the articles of spiegel have this thing going on , with adoring putin ... and yes i read german media , and i am sick of its shit . 
  it has many manipulated informations in it , many also very badly researched . 
  i prefer specialized newsplatforms , specialized like interpreter for example . 
  well , nuland and obama bombed ukraine with sikret cia agents ... oh and mh17 , it was a cia agent ... no wait , i mean a bomb ... no it was us sponsored isis ... god damn it , no , it was a ukrainian jet ... missile i mean . 
  now i have got it !, 
  it was an ukrainian buk launcher , which launched a cia with a jihadi onto mh17 , the jihadi exploded while the cia agent was planting explosives and then putin flew by with his magic bear and began liberating europe ... no wait . 
  every country neighbouring russia does ... that is why everyone is asking for more nato or more in particular us troops ... 
  especially us , because of history . 
  meanwhile merkel is actually ** blocking ** the deployment of nato bases in central europe ... `` not angering the russians '' ... 
  laughable . 
  there must be something behind it ... oh right nordstream 2 and even schulz does n't say anything against it , what wonderful solidarity we have . 
  but actually ... why do you need to see bandera as a hero ? 
  although , i do n't think it is appropiate to ask , but so is politics ... 
  well , we * certainly * are * very * grateful for your * promised * help in world war 2 , * especially * the ending was an absolute ** red ** surprise for us . 
  following the conflict since the beginning . 
  this is what you get out of your classical `` frozen conflict '' with a * very carefully dealt cease-fire * which was * only * broken about 5 times , by doing more and more offensives , while russian generals , which are still in the russian army , are involved . 
  in this case , the eu and the osce are useless . 
  by the way , war is heating up again , although i think it will cool down because of the azerbaijan-armenia conflict ... or it will lie in its shadow , because provocations from russia are a taboo thing for western liberals . 
  iz abot mlticlutraism isn it ? 
  well , they do go to poland and actually work there . 
  so they get classified as migrants ... 
  although the highest number of what i could gather was the internally displaced people , which means , the ukrainian refugees often seek shelter in western ukraine . 
  you do know , that the russian language was made official when yanukovich was in office ? 
  that was in 2006 ... ( please correct if wrong ), 
  euronews is actually pretty bad and also likes to sometimes `` accidentally '' spread propaganda .
