   and gave women the right to vote while in switzerland/france that only happened in 1991 , many people on this thread were probably still already alive then and in switzerland women could not vote and france could have changed that when they controlled switzerland but they did not literally r/shitamericanssay  women in switzerland gained the right to vote in federal elections after a referendum in ** 1971 ** . 
  in ** 1991 following a decision by the federal supreme court of switzerland , appenzell innerrhoden became the last swiss canton ** to grant women the vote on local issues . 
  ** switzerland since 1815 is sovereign country , not controlled by france . 
  ** poland grant women right to vote in 1918 us in 1920 lol . 
  poland better democracy than us . 
  you could also claim that uk is oldest continuous government ( since 1707 or earlier ) , unlike some american claimed  fun fact , [ the united states has the oldest continuous system of government ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gmt1a/french_legislative_elections_first_official/dise6k6/?context=3 ) in the world , it is actually older than your, 
  also he said  including very much france , whose own revolution and republic was modelled on the example set by america age of enlightenment ( from europe , that greatly contributed to american revolution ) say [ hello ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_enlightenment ), 
  we should post it on r/shitamericanssay, 
  what about san marino or japan or the isle of man 's tynwald government ? 
  edit : also probably uk since 1707, 
  and switzerlands was more like client state of french empire than part of france itself , by this logic duchy of warsaw was part of france too ( and poland by the way too ) . 
  us used to be british colony ... us = uk everyone what us did is fault of / or thanks due to uk great logic my american friend, 
  by his logic , russia system ( or indian ) is better than sweden or netherlands ( in ppp it 's probably worse though ), 
  i 'm not sure about [ wroc\u0142aw , according to this info it will be moved to warsaw ] ( http://wroclaw.wyborcza.pl/wroclaw/7,35771,21941908,donald-trump-nie-przyjedzie-do-wroclawia-forum-panstw-trojmorza.html ), 
  tbh it 's easy from pov of western countries ( like uk , us , france , germany etc ) to say such things , most of them never lost their independence ( ** so , for them it 's not a problem or they were n't under control of ussr like eastern block they do n't know how they were lucky that because of it they were free and rich ** ) , and today they are wealthy and strong ( politically , culturally , economicaly ) countries and nations , unlike nations like ours that had to fight for it 's survival and/or have economical troubles or still do n't have it ( freedom ) . 
  ** edit : removed authoritarian part ** ** edit2 : forgot to lnclude that `` us '' ( and some other western nations like dutch , irish ) also fought for independence and east `` germany '' / ddr was part of eastern/soviet block **, 
  yeah , but i meant only european nations who got/restored independent country if i would include asian , african , american nations list would be longer ... much longer, 
  i feel that some of people here if they would be born at the end of 19th century they would be against of free poland ( because it 's russian !!, 
  or it 's against international law , or russian law or it 's hurting economy ) that 's pretty sad . . 
   for some reason people think nationalism - evil probably , because for them nationalism = `` german '' nationalism ( aka expansive one like the one in iww and iiww ) and not nationalism of nations fighting for freedom ( poles , lithuanians , irish etc ) and their state for them ( early german nationalism wanted only to unite all german states into one ) . 
  you mean ... screw all of them ( nations who got their state ) well it 's pretty long list , but i will do it :p czechs poles slovakians croatians romanians greeks bulgarians ukrainians belarusians lithuanians estonians latvians finns irish slovenians montenegrins austrians ( they should be part of germany ! ), 
  hungarians norwegians bosniaks serbs according to `` some '' those nations should go fuck themself and do n't fight for their independence ( ** because nationalism is bad , because it 's hurting regional economy , because it 's not legal blah blah ** ) did i forget some nation ? 
   as if lithuania is not ? 
  if central and eastern europe would be treated like catalonia , to this day russian empire , german empire and austro-hungary , ottoman empire would exist , because f ** k nationalism well and ireland would be still part of uk ... and many others . . 
  i understand ( like you ) actions of catalans . 
   but i guess we can both agree that the xxth century was rough and fucked up for all the sides and we should never let it happen again . 
  well at least we have xxith century and we can hope for better . 
   because why would the modern day germans , who have nothing to do with the ways and actions of their grandparents , have to reach into their pockets and pay for the damages . 
  true . 
   i do n't really care where lviv is located or if danzig belongs to germany or poland or whatever-as long as we can all live in such peace as we do now . 
  cheers i agree . 
  cheers too !, 
  said guy from country that is `` meddling in ukraine 's ( and others countries ) internal affairs '' . 
  seems totally legit . . 
   i 'm pretty sure a great number of germans supported the nsdap for the same reason . 
  look , i 'm not trying to whitewash their guilt , all i 'm saying it 's not really worth it ( and possible ) to seek compensatiion for such a thing . 
  well that 's truth too :p i 'm not looking for compensation , i was saying it was would be nice if germany would pay for restoring those building and that it would for gain them positive points from many poles ( i already like germans and germany and it would n't change my opinion ), 
   so you only want to keep the profitable treaties and decisions , but the bad ones are invalid ? 
  no matter what you say , according to the international law , poland is no longer entitled to reparations on that matter , as sad as it may sound but its true . 
  to be fair i 'm fine with that , i 'd rather live in a united europe striving for a common goal , rather than have us milk germany dry again , not sure of the consequences . 
  well , here you are right , since prl was according to international law `` independent state '' it 's treaties and decistions are valid and binding and we have to follow them whetever we do n't like them or not ( sadly , screw ussr but such were times then . ), 
   3 million poles were members of the polish united workers ' party . 
  they did n't fall from the sky either . 
  well . .  ** in the crowning time of the puwp 's development ( the end of the 1970s ) it consisted of over 3.5 million members . 
  ** plenty people who were part of it ( not because of their support for it ) , did it for personal gains because it was party who ruled country so best and easiest way to get benefits was to join the party ( and to not have troubles ) . 
  true . . but still 1 : nsdap won elections ( and they needed coalition partner to rule ) , while ppr falsified it 2 : there was no of foreign power interfering in germany ( germans won elections and it was germans who made nazi germany one party totalitarian state ) like in poland where ussr ( foreign power interfering ) put their puppet goverment . 
  but you are right that nsdap after winning elections fucked with political system and made germany totalitarian state . 
   oh really , well by that rationale germany 1933-1945 was n't ` true germany ' well , i do n't think it 's good argument since hitler and nsdap [ won elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_march_1933 ) in 1933 fairly ( what they did later is different thing though . ), 
   despite achieving a much better result than in the november 1932 election , the nazis did not do as well as hitler had hoped . 
  in spite of massive violence and intimidation , the nazis won only 43.9 % of the vote , rather than the majority that he had expected . 
   therefore , hitler was forced to maintain his coalition with the dnvp to control a majority of seats . 
  the communists ( kpd ) lost about a fourth of their votes , while the social democrats suffered only moderate losses . 
  although the kpd had not been formally banned , it was a foregone conclusion that the kpd deputies would never be allowed to take their seats . 
  within a few days , all of the kpd 's representatives were either under arrest or were in hiding . 
   although the nazi-dnvp coalition had enough seats to conduct the basic business of government , hitler needed a two-thirds majority to pass the enabling act , a law which allowed the cabinet -- in effect , the chancellor -- to enact laws without the approval of the reichstag for a four-year period . 
  with certain exceptions , such laws could deviate from the weimar constitution . 
  leaving nothing to chance , the nazis used the provisions of the reichstag fire decree to arrest all 81 communist deputies and keep several social democrats out of the chamber . 
  while ppr took power only because of help ussr that controlled territories of poland and [ falsifying elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_legislative_election,_1947 ) . 
   opposition candidates and activists were persecuted until election day ; only the ppr and its allies were allowed to campaign unhindered . 
  the publicized results were falsified , with the official results known to selected government officials long before the actual elections took place and any votes were counted . 
   the real results were not known to anyone . 
  in areas where the government had sufficient control , some of the ballot boxes were simply destroyed without being counted , or exchanged with boxes filled with prepared votes . 
  where possible , government officials simply filled in the numbers in the relevant documents as per instructions from soviet and ppr officials without bothering to count the real votes . 
   a time magazine article covering the elections noted in its lead paragraph : `` in a spirit of partisan exuberance tempered with terror , poland approached its first nationwide popular election , ten days hence . 
  by last week most of the combined opposition ( socialist and polish peasant party ) candidates had been jailed , and their supporters more or less completely cowed by the secret police , by striking their names from voting lists and by arrest . 
  the communist-dominated government ventured to predict an `` overwhelming '' victory . 
  `` historian piotr wrobel wrote that this election saw `` the highest level of repression and terror '' that was ever seen during the four decades of communist rule in poland . 
  edit : ** i gave more info from wikipedia to make my arguments stronger and to correct some details **, 
   but the polish government has refused in 1953 . 
  well , they refused to get aid from marshall plan it 's not surprising that they refused here ( capitalist scum ) . 
  chapeau bas to bernardo canaletto , his paintings were great help in time of need, 
  true , but it would `` very nice '' too if germany payed/give money to rebuild destroyed buildings ( palaces , churches , houses etc ) they would gain positive points . 
  and next great northern war ( geez , sweden you could fight with saxony on it 's territory :d ) made it only worse . 
  actually there was n't kingdom of poland then . 
  in 1863 the january uprising broke out , but lasted only two years before being crushed . 
  as a direct result , any remaining separate status of the kingdom was removed and the political entity was directly incorporated into the russian empire . 
  ** the unofficial name privislinsky krai ( russian : \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0439 ) , i.e. , ` vistula land ' , replaced ` kingdom of poland ' as the area 's official name and the area became a namestnichestvo under the control of a namiestnik until 1875 , when it became a guberniya . 
   deluge well . .  the swedish invasion ** affected the richest provinces of the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ( greater poland , lesser poland , mazovia , pomerelia , kujawy , podlasie ) , which for the most part had not been affected by major wars for 200 years . 
  professor andrzej rottermund , manager of the royal castle in warsaw , claims that the swedish army robbed poland of her most precious goods ** - thousands of works of art , books and valuables . 
  most of these items have never been returned to poland , and are kept both in private swedish hands , and in stockholm museums , such as swedish army museum , and livrustkammaren . 
  ** almost all cities , towns , castles and churches in locations where swedish troops were stationed were destroyed ; and as prof. rottermund says this can be seen even today , as in guides to many polish towns and cities one will find a note that says `` object destroyed during swedish invasion '' . 
  from the royal castle in warsaw the swedes stole app . 
  200 paintings , a number of carpets and turkish tents , musical instruments , furniture , chinese porcelain , weapons , books , manuscripts , marbles , even dresses of maids and door frames pulled from walls . 
  **  ** huber kowalski of the university of warsaw institute of archeology says that swedes stole anything they could lay their hands on - windows , stairs , chimneys , sculptures , floors , doors and gates . 
  most goods were loaded on boats and transported along the vistula to the baltic sea , and then to sweden . 
  in november 2011 , archeologists of the university of warsaw found app . 
  70 items ( total weight five tons ) , which probably come from the warsaw royal castle . 
  they sank in the vistula while being transported to sweden ** . 
  even though article 9 of the treaty of oliva stated that sweden should return all stolen goods , all items are still kept in stockholm and other swedish locations . 
  ** several polish kings ( john ii casimir , john iii sobieski and stanis\u0142aw ii augustus ) sent official missions to sweden , but without success . 
  in most situations , swedish authorities claimed that they did not know where stolen goods were ** . 
  in 1911 , krak\u00f3w 's academy of science sent its own mission , which was made up of renowned professors eugeniusz barwi\u0144ski , ludwik birkenmajer and jan \u0141o\u015b . 
  in stockholm and uppsala they found 205 manuscripts and 168 rare polish books , describing their foundings in a report . 
  in 2002 , the warsaw royal castle organized an exhibition , `` eagle and three crowns '' , which presented many items stolen from poland , and kept in swedish museums . 
  after the deluge , the commonwealth became a `` cultural desert '' . 
  poland and lithuania lost 67 libraries and 17 archives . 
  ** of all major cities of the country , only lw\u00f3w and gda\u0144sk were not destroyed , and when swedish soldiers were unable to steal an item , they would destroy or burn it . 
  in ruins were castles , palaces , churches , abbeys , towns and villages . 
  as a result of the swedish invasion , few pre-baroque buildings remained in poland . 
  **  among others , swedish troops stole such items as :  - ** both polish and lithuanian state records ( metrica regni poloniae ) , **  - ** the royal library from warsaw , **  - ** libraries from ujazd\u00f3w castle , toru\u0144 , bydgoszcz , malbork , pozna\u0144 , grudzi\u0105dz , gniezno , lublin , jaros\u0142aw , vilnius , sandomierz , radom , and krak\u00f3w , also archives and libraries from most towns of royal prussia .
