  **  according to the estimates of polish scholars i. ihnatowicz , z. landau , a. m\u0105czak and b. zientara , the invasion by the swedish army and its allies ( brandenburg-prussia and transilvania ) , ** resulted in the loss of 25 % of the population in four core polish provinces . 
  lesser poland lost 23 % of population , mazovia 40 % in villages and 70 % in towns , greater poland 50 % in villages and 60 % in towns .

  [ according to wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/planned_destruction_of_warsaw#rebuilding_of_the_city )  even before the uprising , the germans knew warsaw would fall into allied hands in a matter of few months . 
  in spite of this , unprecedented effort was dedicated to the destruction of the city . 
  this decision tied up considerable resources , which in theory could have been used on the eastern front and on the newly opened western front after the normandy landings . 
  ** the germans destroyed 80 % -90 % of the buildings in warsaw while an immense part of the cultural heritage was deliberately demolished , burned to the ground , or stolen . 
  **  currently , more than half of the antiques and museum objects of polish heritage stolen by germans in 1944 have not been returned to poland . 
  after the war , extensive work was put into rebuilding the city according to pre-war plans and historical documents . 
  as with most of poland , the city was rebuilt without any german labor , unlike in stalingrad and other cities , where german forced labor was used during and after the war as part of war reparations . 
  `` after war ''  the destruction of the city was so severe that , in order to rebuild much of old warsaw , detailed 18th-century landscapes by the italian artists marcello bacciarelli and bernardo bellotto , commissioned by the government before the partitions of poland , had to be used in recreating many of the buildings . 
  also of assistance were architectural drawings that had been made before world war ii . 
   the city of warsaw was rebuilt by the communist government between the 1950s and 1970 only with russian help . 
  some of the landmarks were reconstructed as late as the 1980s . 
  ** while the old town has been thoroughly reconstructed , the new town has only been partially restored to its former state ** .

  poland : we 've had worse, 
  what a weird picture for m1 abrams in us part of mbt :p, 
  they are shipping macron and romania together ? 
  aww they are so cute . 
   and the region is below polish average in terms of wealth and development , so i would n't be so sure that germany would get a better end of the deal in such case . 
  if im correct east prussia was also one of poorest regions in interwar germany . 
  i always forgot that supposed amnout of money that germany would owe to poland is that large , perhaps those $ 100 billion are for warsaw itself ... 
  anyway i think that demanding those sums is stupid ( if im correct ussr was supposed to give our share of war reperations , well screw them ) and most probably impossible to get ( germans would laugh at that ) . 
  that 's pretty great info . 
  thanks , til !, 
   of course . 
  i never implied otherwise . 
  myself i 'm not sure about that choice , basing on wiki article about f-35  the program is the most expensive military weapons system in history , ** and has been much criticized inside and outside government , in the u.s. and in allied countries . 
  critics argue that the plane is `` plagued with design flaws , '' with many blaming the procurement process in which lockheed was allowed `` to design , test , and produce the f-35 all at the same time , instead of ... [ identifying and fixing ] defects before firing up its production line ** . '', 
  by 2014 , the program was `` $ 163 billion over budget [ and ] seven years behind schedule . '', 
  critics also contend that the program 's high sunk costs and political momentum make it `` too big to kill . '', 
  po is obviously pro-eu ( and it 's voters ) , they wanted to steal some moderate voters of pis because currently theres stalemate ( pis + kukiz15 have similar support to po+m odern + psl + probably sld ) in support of parties and po needs some `` blood '' to win with pis . 
  some ( well maybe plenty ) right wing poles loves to bring that germany owes reperation to poland for iiww ( mentioned 100 bln ) not my opinion though .

   sweden was winning the defensive war against russia , plc and denmark tho . 
  actually sweden was `` aggresive '' one in case of plc king of saxony ( who was also king of plc ) planned with russia to attack sweden to gain lands ( in his case for personal goals to to gain livonia to make his claim to crown of plc stronger ) polish sejm ( and only sejm was allowed to give permission to start war ) did n't agreed to those plans ( so plc was neutral part ) swedes curbstomed saxons , king augustus strong ran to plc and sweden went after him and brought war to plc , nobody asked us if we wanted war :p from wiki ***  charles xii then turned south to meet his last undefeated opponent : augustus ii , elector of saxony , king of poland and grand duke of lithuania . 
  ** the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth was formally neutral at this point , as augustus started the war as an elector of saxony ** . 
  disregarding polish negotiation proposals supported by the swedish parliament , *** ***  charles defeated the saxon army at a battle near riga in 1701 , took over courland and ** entered the commonwealth , at that time not an official participant of the war ** . 
  *** and then sweden vs russia/saxony lead war on our lands that were ravaged by into , and our country plunged into civil war, 
   both nations were not focused on naval power and both nations did n't had colonies well , when we tried to focus of naval power ( we wanted to imposite tariff based on truce of altmark where swedenes drained our economy for their gains to build strong navy ) , danish captain stormed into gdansk and destroyed our fleet , took their shipps into gdansk and succeed to stop our plans because they agreed too leave after we stoped our naval plans ... *** also from wiki  popular vote and opposition also resulted in the failure of the plan to raise taxes from trade tariffs ; here it was not only the nobility but even the merchants and burghers from towns , like gda\u0144sk ( danzig ) who were able to muster enough support ( including from foreign powers ) to stop the king 's reforms . 
  in fact , the defeat of his plans was so total , that he was forced to make certain conciliatory gestures to the nobility , as the sejm passed several laws constraining his authority ( such as to hire foreign troops ) , further indicating the limits of royal power in the commonwealth ***  around the start of the 17th century , poland became ruled by the house of vasa , and was involved in a series of wars with sweden ( see also dominium maris baltici ) . 
  vasa kings attempted to create a proper fleet , but their attempts met with repeated failures , due to lack of funds in the royal treasury ( polish nobility saw little need for the fleet and refused to raise taxes for its construction , and gda\u0144sk continued its opposition to the idea of a royal fleet ) . 
  during the reign of sigismund iii of poland , the most celebrated victory of the commonwealth navy took place at the battle of oliwa in 1627 against sweden , during the polish -- swedish war . 
  the victory over sweden secured for poland permanent access to the atlantic , and laid the foundations for expeditions beyond europe . 
  the plans for the independent fleet fell through shortly afterwards due to a badly executed alliance with the habsburgs who in 1629 took over the fleet . 
  nobles said `` fuck this '' *** also ( earlier ) gda\u0144sk was corrupt ( and many of our important officials like zamojski ) and during stefan batory it supported him but only after plc king stoped our naval plans ( aka karnkowski statutes made by last jagiellon zygmunt august ) . 
  we had so many chances ... 
   plc was in personal union with saxony , hmmph let 's see ... if saxony is part of plc. . . and saxony was part of hre , does that mean that polska is emperor of hre !? 
  genius !, 
  just kidding , this union screwed us with another war with sweden . 
  it 's probably eu iv reference or reference to china 's history with their mandate of heaven ( for emperor ) and having tributary states ( for example korea ) . 
  well if i 'm correct czechoslovakia had one of best tanks/tankettes ( and it 's industry ) in europe , and nazi germany after `` conquering '' czechoslovakia took those tanks and incorporated them into german army , it was probably same with other `` equipment ( vehicles and weapons , ammo etc ) '', 
   france signing munich agreement instead of going to war with nazis is the reason why soviets never helped , even tho they offered to do so the czechoslovak goverment declined because they were afraid that soviets would want something in return ... it happened regardless , welp . 
  true , it was stupid of them not to help , but the same applies to poland if we would help you instead of being butthurt about `` zaolzie '' there would n't be about six millions of dead poles and ravaged country . 
  `` a pole is wise after the event '', 
   it was my fav . 
  part of the silmairillon and it 's a reason why i wanted the silmairillon to be turned into a tv series . 
  myself , i do n't have favorite part of the silmarillion since i love everything there ( maybe except of description noldors realms it was kinda too long but it was still `` okay '' ) i liked more turin story than beren and luthien one . 
  i would love to see tv series too . 
  valars were kinda dicks to mankind imo, 
  i think it 's sarcasm :p, 
  you guys can count on us to defend you, 
  during interwar period it had one of best arms industries early middle age was hard time in relations poland-czechia ( plenty of wars etc ) we fought each other for control of silesia untill we lost it ( mostly ) in 14th century and silesian duchies become fiefs of bohemia . 
  branch of jagiellons rulled over czechia in union with hungary we had a war with matthias corvinus ( king of hungary ) over czech crown lands firstly it ended with partition of czech crown ( bohemia for jagiellons moravia and silesia for corvinus ) after corvinus death , jagiellon had rule over entire czech crown during interwar period it was very wealthy country in central europe , after interwar communism `` ruined '' their wealth . 
  creators of `` robot word '' thanks for st. adalbert of prague , one of saints of poland . 
  prague was capital of hre in early 17th century czechia was fief of hre and was one of countries allowed ( they were allowed in 13th century if i am correct ) to elect emperor they brought christianity to us ( and we borrowed plenty of words due of that ) they used to have big german minority ( they probably still have but not large as it used to be ) there are bohemia ( proper czechia ) , moravia and silesia parts ( czech crown ) funny language jan hus and hussites ( glorious hussite war ) our relations were strained in interwar period due to border conflicts ( it lasted to prl ) jan zizka ( fought in battle of grunwald ) one of best commanders of middle ages . 
  one of first slavic nations to have their own `` national ( in national language ) literature . 
  `` luxembourgs '' were pain of ass due to their claims to polish crown :p got ravaged by thirty years war ( battle of white mountain ) and germinastion that occured after hapsburgs took over czechia during interwar period they were one of most pro-soviet countries ( if i 'm correct ) they belonged to little entente and were one of major allies of french . 
  they were great help to israel in time of need ( they gave them/let bought weapons ) big brother of slovakia in 14-15th centuries they kings supported teutonic order, 
  thanks for info and explanation !, 
  yep , but if i am correct , in us there is no obligatory military service , if it were , it would be true screw up . . 
  i do n't drink alcohol , but i feel sorry for you guys , because in my opinion your goverment is openly discriminating against of you ( female part of population doese n't have to go to do obligatory service in military , and now they took your right to drink alcohol in age of 18 . 
  what is this ? 
  some kind of authoritarian goverment ? ), 
  they do n't respect sacrifice of guys in age of 18-19 . 
  sorry for this rant , but i had to . 
   you can be drafted at 18 years old as soon as you finish school . 
  so you can go to military at age of 18 , but not drink according to those guys , that 's bullshit and unfair bullshit imo . 
  my male lithuanian friends , what is age of compulsory military service for men ? 
  because if you can not drink but you can go to military ( or vote , drive a car , get a married ) then i ca n't even ( can not drink , but can use gun or lead unit into combat , great :p ) ... 
   ** poland 's supreme court has ruled invalid the president 's 2015 pardon of a former anti-corruption agency chief because a jail sentence was not legally binding at the time . 
  **  in 2013 , law and justice ( pis ) mp mariusz kami\u0144ski -- who served as head of the anti-corruption agency from 2006 and 2009 -- was found guilty of overstepping his powers . 
   he was sentenced to three years in prison and was banned from holding public office for ten years . 
   but kami\u0144ski 's appealed , and was later pardoned by polish president andrzej duda , which saw the case against him dismissed . 
   a supreme court judge said that the president interfered in the legal process because kami\u0144ski was proven neither innocent nor guilty when he was pardoned , rendering a future ruling obsolete . 
   `` after a binding verdict the rule of presuming ( innocence ) is null , '' the judge said , adding that the president can pardon someone after a final verdict `` because then he is not interfering with the judiciary '' . 
   polish justice minister zbigniew ziobro said he would consider asking the constitutional tribunal to review the supreme court decision , while pawe\u0142 mucha , an official from the president 's office , said duda 's decision to pardon kami\u0144ski was legal . 
   mucha added that pardons were the president 's prerogative and it was not the supreme court 's place to intervene . 
   `` the pardon ... is effective and still binding , '' mucha said . 
   kami\u0144ski said that by deciding to void the pardon the supreme court had `` put itself above the law '' . 
   a spokesperson for the supreme court said the presidential pardon was `` an inherent right , we are not trying to contest it '' . 
   he added that kami\u0144ski 's case would return to the appeal process . 
   in 2009 , kami\u0144ski was accused of `` committing offences against the credibility of documents '' during the central anti-corruption bureau 's investigation of the so-called land scandal in 2007 . 
   the anti-corruption agency allegedly conducted a sting operation in which bribes were paid for the zoning change of agricultural land into residential plots , which saw then-deputy prime minister andrzej lepper dismissed and the collapse of the coalition government . 
   duda 's decision to pardon kami\u0144ski before a ruling was final was unprecedented . 
   in 2015 duda said that people who fought against corruption deserved special protection,
