   the only countries that really matter are germany , united kingdom , france , italy and perhaps spain anyway if you `` would '' count spain , you would have to count poland too . 
  according to [ global firepower ranks ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) , poland is 18 strongest military while spain is 27 . yes , spain has bigger gdp but that doese n't mean that it have stronger military than poland . 
   i would be glad if poland would spend as much in % of gdp as usa .

  true , but unfortunately for our president , mod in us falls under control of potus , while in poland is separate body , imo it 's the problem , because we do n't need two leaders ( or maybe more if counting prime minister too ) of military ( and the problem is greater if president and rulling party/coalition are hostile to each other ) .

  **  mps from the civic platform ( po ) party want an inquiry into their claims that unauthorised people had access to secret paperwork regarding a pln 13 billion ( eur 3 billion ) planned deal for 50 caracal multi-role choppers from french-based airbus helicopters for the polish military , which ended in late 2016 . 
   the po mps say that wac\u0142aw berczy\u0144ski , who recently quit as head of a new inquiry into the 2010 smolensk crash , his deputy kazimierz nowaczyk , and defence minister antoni macierewicz 's former aide bart\u0142omiej misiewicz , were not cleared by special services and did not have security certificates .

   meanwhile , deputy defence minister micha\u0142 dworczyk said po mps in their time also allowed access to confidential documents .

  senate is upper chamber , while sejm is lower , so answer it 's yes they are separate things ( both can form nation assembly in time of important events ) . 
   may 24 polish president andrzej duda said on wednesday he wants to hold a referendum in november 2018 on whether to change the country 's 20-year-old constitution , although it was not clear what kind of changes he was seeking . 
   duda has said previously that the balance of powers in the current constitution , poland 's first after the fall of communism , is incorrect . 
   he has avoided any specific changes he would like to see made to the document , although he has suggested that the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces in name only . 
   `` i will ask the senate ( poland 's upper house of parliament ) to hold a referendum on nov. 11 , 2018 , in order to delineate the foundation of the future constitution , '' duda said on state-run television . 
  nov. 11 is poland 's independence day . 
   the 45-year-old duda , an ally of the conservative ruling law and justice ( pis ) party , has said previously he would like poles to decide whether there is a need for a new constitution . 
   the current constitution was adopted in april of 1997 . 
   `` in many cases , in my opinion , the division between powers was done incorrectly '' in the 1997 constitution , duda told radio dla ciebie earlier this month . 
   he said that although the constitution stipulates that the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces , in practice it is very different . 
   `` the president can propose , suggest different initiatives , but if the minister ( of defence ) does not agree , then the president in this case is trammelled . 
  you can say it this way : the phrase ` commander-in-chief ' is not reflected in practice . '', 
   nov. 11 next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the restoration of polish sovereignty after 123 years of partition by the russian empire , the kingdom of prussia and the habsburg empire .
