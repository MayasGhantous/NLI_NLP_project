  maybe [ this ] ( http://www.nextbigfuture.com/2016/06/next-generation-german-and-french-main.html ), 
   there 's also the fact that the spaniards are n't going to be happy about it well some could say , that russians were n't happy when soviet union fell apart and baltics , estonians , ukrainians , belarussians gained indepedence , same could be said in 1918 , when countries like poland , czechoslovakia and many others gained indepedence from russia,germany,austro-hungary . 
  i 'm not saying that spain is bad ( i 'm not best person to tell about situation in spain ) , but to look from pov of smaller nations that wanted to be free , their stronger and greater `` overlords '' were n't happy to let them go . 
  well it was probably about something other , but i 'll give you text to read ( i have to make next post because it 's to large amount of text ) [ polish original ] ( http://www.zaolzie.org/zaolziearchiwum/biuletyn1/biuletyn20040123.htm ) and google translation  ** benesz to moscicki **  ** mr. 
  president !, 
  **  ** prague , 22 . ix . 
  1938 **  at a time when the fate of europe is at stake and when our two nations are keenly interested in building a lasting basis for genuine cooperation between the two countries , i turn to his excellency proposing to establish friendly relations and new co-operation between poland and czechoslovakia . 
   i am therefore presenting , on behalf of the czechoslovak state , the excellency , the proposal of a sincere and friendly alignment of our different points of view on matters concerning the problem of the polish population in czechoslovakia . 
  i would like to put this matter at the heart of the principle of border rectification . 
  consistency in our mutual relations will , of course , be the logical and immediate consequence of this agreement . 
  if we reach an agreement and i am sure it will be possible - i would consider it to be the beginning of a new era in relations between our two countries . 
   i would like to add as former minister of foreign affairs and the current president of the republic that czechoslovakia has neither at present nor ever had any obligations or treaties , secret or public , whose significance , purpose or intent would harm the interests of poland . 
   i confidently submit this proposal to your excellency with the consent of the responsible ministers at the same time to give it the character of a lasting agreement . 
   i would like to make this matter of interest exclusively to our two states . 
   knowing the delicacy of our mutual relations and realizing how difficult it was in ordinary times to fix them with ordinary diplomatic and political means , i am trying to seize the current crisis to remove the barriers that have taken place in the past decades and to immediately create a new atmosphere . 
  i do it in full honesty . 
  i am convinced that the future of our two nations and their future mutual cooperation must be finally assured . 
   please accept the excellency the words of my deepest sympathy . 
  bene\u0160 **  ** mo\u015acicki 's reply to benesz **  ** warsaw , september 27 , 1938 **  ** mr. 
  president !, 
  **  in response to the letter of your excellency , which was delivered to me on 26th , i shall hasten to inform you that i have carefully considered your excellency 's proposals . 
   i fully agree with your excellency that relations between our countries can only improve in this case if immediate and effective decisions are taken immediately . 
   also , i am of the opinion that today the decision on territorial issues is definitely ahead , which , in almost 20 years , has made it impossible to improve the atmosphere between our countries . 
   by submitting to my government your suggestion , i am convinced that it will be possible to draft a contract in a short time that would meet the requirements of the current situation . 
   please accept the excellency the words of my deepest sympathy . 
   ** mo\u015acicki **  ** czech minister of foreign affairs kroft to polish ambassador pap\u00c9e **  ** nr 139.350 / ii-1 38 **  ** prague , september 30 , 1938 **  ** mr. 
  minister !, 
  **  i have read the note of september 27 , in which your excellency proposes , on behalf of your government , the conclusion of an immediate agreement regulating the disputes between our two states , and in particular the matter of the territory inhabited by the people of polish nationality . 
   the czechoslovak government is grateful to the government of the republic of poland for expressing its views on the manner in which the czechoslovak government views the desired agreement . 
   desiring that this agreement be lasting and leaving no side of both sides feel bitterness , the czechoslovak government allows itself to propose the following procedure , stating that for the reasons that will be mentioned , would like to avoid that the czechoslovak society has the impression that it uses the difficulty in which czechoslovakia is currently located is precisely at the moment when the question of territory inhabited by the german population is resolved . 
  the czechoslovak government would like to emphasize that this is an act of goodwill arising from its own initiative and its own decision . 
  he considers this to be very important for relations between the two peoples and both states in the future , the relations that they would like to be most friendly . 
   first of all , the czechoslovak government allows us to notice that in negotiations on the german population in the republic we were forced to reject both the plebiscite and the territorial assignments before the final determination of the borders . 
  for these reasons , the czechoslovak government can not derogate from this principle  also in the case of poland , the more that this could become a precedent in resolving the question of the german sudetenland , which would not lie in the intentions of the government of the republic of poland . 
   starting from these assumptions , the czechoslovak government allows itself to present the following principles for resolving this issue . 
  ** the government of czechoslovakia solemnly assures the government of poland that the rectification of the borders and subsequent transfer of the area to be determined by the proceeding will be carried out in all circumstances , regardless of the international situation ** the czechoslovak republic is also ready to make a statement on this matter to france and the united kingdom , and to recognize both of them as guarantors of the agreement . 
  the area of the area would be based on the principle that these districts would be territorially divided according to the ratio of the polish population to the czech one . 
  a quantitatively established polish-czechoslovak committee would be created immediately to develop a detailed procedure on the basis of this principle . 
  it could be convened on october 5 , 1938 . 
  the commission would shape the issue of housing options , resettlement and exchange of bilateral populations , and all the economic and financial issues that come with it . 
  a deadline should be set for the commission to complete its work . 
  we propose october 31 . 
  a deadline should be set for the acquisition of land . 
  this deadline would be fixed by adopting two final limits : date as close as possible and as far as possible . 
  the common message could immediately be communicated to the polish and czechoslovak society that an agreement was reached on the principles of the polish-czechoslovak agreement on border rectification and that the whole procedure would be completed within a time limit agreed by both parties . 
  in order not to leave any doubt as to the agreement and to the strong will that animates the two governments , the commission , as stated above , will commence work no later than 5 october , and the acquisition of that site may take place no earlier than 31 october and no later than 1 december . 
  the date on which the competent committee will quit . 
  december 1 deadline should not be exceeded . 
   the czechoslovak government is of the opinion that it is a matter that is so precise , concrete and decisive that it can be accepted and implemented in a spirit of good will and understanding . 
   i believe that on this basis we can come to an agreement that will provide both nations in the future with the conviction that the conflict has finally been resolved , and that there is no reason for bitterness between them , nor the accusation that also in other political problems will arise immediately between the two you have an atmosphere whereby their friendly cooperation will be fully ensured . 
   please accept our highest respect . 
   yes i mean this . 
  by sighing this pact , poland ruined french and czechoslovak efforts to create anti-german coalition . 
  in fact , poland betrayed france after french help to poland during 1920 war . 
  poland also refused to let soviet army go through its territory to defend czechoslovakia after munich agreement . 
  well  one of the most noted of j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski 's foreign policies was his rumored proposal to france to declare war on germany after adolf hitler had come to power , in january 1933 . 
  ** some historians write that pi\u0142sudski may have sounded out france regarding the possibility of joint military action against germany , which had been openly rearming in violation of the versailles treaty . 
  france 's refusal might have been one of the reasons that poland signed the german -- polish non-aggression pact . 
  **  ** however , the argument that the german-polish non-aggression pact had been forced on pi\u0142sudski by french refusal to wage a `` preventive war '' has been disputed by historians , who point out that there is no evidence in french or polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal was ever advanced . 
  they state that when in late october 1933 , rumors of a polish `` preventive-war '' proposal were reported in paris , their source was the polish embassy , which had informed french reporters that poland had proposed a `` preventive war '' to france and belgium , but poland and germany had already been secretly negotiating their pact ** . 
  it has been argued that pi\u0142sudski had had the polish embassy start rumors about a `` preventive war '' to pressure the germans , who were demanding that poland abrogate its 1921 franco-polish alliance . 
  the pact would specifically exclude that alliance . 
   ** it has been said that pi\u0142sudski 's reason for seeking the pact with germany was his concern over france 's maginot line . 
  until 1929 , french plans had called for a french offensive into the north german plain , in conjunction with offensives from poland and czechoslovakia . 
  ** the building of the maginot line began in 1929 and indicated that the french army would maintain a strictly defensive stance , and france 's eastern allies were going to be on their own . 
  ( that is exactly what happened in 1939 with the phoney war . ), 
  from pi\u0142sudski 's viewpoint , in light of france 's military plans , a non-aggression pact with germany would be the best choice for poland . 
  ~ ~ if i remember correctly , we also talked with czechoslovakia that in case if they fought with nazi germany in 1938 , we would support them , and if they would agree ( and not defend themselves ) to german claims , we would press ours ~ ~ ( it was about different thing , i corrected myself in new post ) ** we had same pact with soviet union , is it bad too ? 
  ** also why should we let soviet army to go through our territory , if it was our enemy ? 
   it does n't matter that these territories were `` yours '' 100 years before the revolution . 
  they were n't populated by poles . 
  also some of them were lithuanian even in plc , but poland conquered them anyway . 
  by annexing these territories , poland also broke several agreements with great britain . 
  well they were n't russian either [ and during partitions time they also broke several agreements ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5syf8e/today_in_1991_lithuania_voted_for_independence/ddj8k3c/?context=3 ) . 
  about lithuanian ( they conquereded those lands and we took them peacefully ) you mean those territories that were given to crown of poland by grand duke of lithuania ( and king of poland ) in 1569 union of lublin ? 
  ( central and eastern ukraine ) if you mean lithuanian part of gdl post-lublin union , then we conquered those lands that were polish-majority like [ vilnius ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fe/d7/83/fed78399e08b161e09b0cdd0a0c0ffa3.jpg ) ( lithuania proper ) or `` tutejszy '' ( current belarus , ) well it was quite shitty behaviour from us but as you said it was geopolitcial game where everyone played . 
   by annexing these territories , poland also broke several agreements with great britain . 
  well tbh from our pov , uk was not considered friendly to poland , and pro-german and [ curzon line obsessed ] ( http://www.polishgreatness.com/images/curzonlinemap.gif ) , according to they plans , we would ( probably ) lost lw\u00f3w / l'viv , and have only congress poland , western galicia and grand duchy of posen region  i do n't say that polish people deserved what happened to them , but the polish state definitely was not good peaceful regime , it played the same geopolitical game everyone played between world wars , so i would n't call it totally innocent to what happened . 
  i agree with you in this part , saddly we acted like assholes in interbellum and it 's biting us in ass ** edit : added some things **, 
   then they jointly this nazi germany invaded czechoslovakia , we never invaded czechoslovakia jointly with germany , it was our own acction , disscued with czechoslovakian goverment ( president mo\u015bcicki talked about this )  that they had their own pact with germany , [ you mean this ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact ) [ then what about this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact )  then pilsudski was best buddy with hitler wait what ? ... 
   that was an aggressor during russian civil war well , we were taking our territories from plc period ( 1772-1795 remember ? 
  ) , nobody forced you to take it then ( also we were promised during congress poland period that we will get some territories from russian partition , we never got it back ) :p  that they oppressed jews , belorussians and ukrainians in their state . 
  i agree with that , it was shitty thing to do . 
  there was also [ soviet-polish non-agression pact . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact ) just saying that ... [ about pact with germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact )  one of the most noted of j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski 's foreign policies was his rumored proposal to france to declare war on germany after adolf hitler had come to power , in january 1933 .

  i would say that poland is both , slavic and western :p, 
  ** poles having freedom boner before it was cool and mainstream ** gloria victis !, 
  you should also add that when in europe most countries were absolute monarchy , plc had mixed-type ( noble democracy ) monarchy with 8-10 % ( szlachta ) male population allowed to choose next king and having it 's share in rulling country .
