  *** ** edit : adding some things ** [ first modern constitution in europe and second in world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_constitution_of_poland ) first country in europe with education [ branch of goverment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commission_of_national_education ) also polish womens got their right to vote in 1918 , while for example french womens got it later in middle 1940 's, 
  it 's time to hijack tank and to do some `` tank rampage '' with military . 
  po ( former goverment with psl as coalition partner in 2007-2015 and party which i 'm suppoting ) actually wanted to buy european equipment ( german leopard tanks , and french caracals etc. ), 
  sadly pis won elections in 2015 and broke agreement , but in most recent poll , pis fell on second place ( and in others it 's losing support with po coming close ) , and po have a lead for [ while/now ] ( http://m.salon24.pl/605396894ad1cccdfcfe7afed35651b4,750,0,0,0.jpg ) . 
  so we can hope that pro-european goverment in poland will return in 2019 ( with tusk being elected as president in 2020 ) personally i support buying european equipment , but that 's just my opinion . 
  about that , i explained it in my answer to u/kara-kalloveship, 
  yes i know , and i 'm sorry for that . 
  i was totally against of it ( seriously screw pis ) , airbus have solid proof now , because recently we found out that wac\u0142aw berczy\u0144ski ( smole\u0144sk comission and `` conspiracy theories '' , and advisor to macierewicz minstry of defence , he worked in boeing geez . . ) said in interview ( either he is stupid , lying or dunno ) that he was responsible for screwing up `` caracals '' ( and he escaped to us after saying that . ), 
  we have about 48 f-16 :p so not only soviet machines '' :d, 
  it looks pretty , i like it . 
  hello my japanese / `` anime '' friends what 's most interesting ( and/or your favorite one ) part/time/period of japanese history according to your opinion ? 
  tbh map of europe without poland/plc ( partitions time ) is n't better :(, 
  somethine something were my brother ? 
  poland and if i have to choose other one , then czechoslovakia is mine choice . 
  pis seems to be soft on both of trump and erdogan , imo they should take harder line on erdogan while soft on trump since we need us aid and we can not piss off leader of us ( that 's last thing that we need ) . 
  - partitions of plc ( all of them were tragic events that had horrible results for poland and poles ) - 1648-1667 ( deluge ruined us ) wars in plc - second world war, 
  in my opinion if she is physically attractive then she is attractive and her ethnicity/race/nationality does n't matter . 
  [ psl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_people%27s_party ) will hate you op for all the eternities , for this thread . 
   no pls no more [ yes !, 
  yes !,

  you know what [ must be done ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/althistory/images/7/7a/royal_banner_of_the_polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth.svg/revision/latest?cb=20120201032655 ) !, 
  well in case if you did n't wanted us , we will take ukrainians ! . . 
  you `` ll be jealous !, 
  marry : germany fuck : hungary/or lithuania/or ukraine ( or maybe all of them :p ) kill : russia just my personal opinion :p, 
   are they based on intuition ? 
  i quess , they are based on personal feels and views , that 's why we see answers with scotland or catalonia , but it 's just my `` answer '' personally i think it will be some balkan country , perhaps you are right with montenegro . 
  yes , there are plenty of normal patriotic/nationalist people , i 'm myself patriotic ( or maybe even nationalist to some ) person , i love history of poland , culture of my country , my nation , i 'm proud of our great deeds , and shame because of our bad actions . . 
   i am also a pan-european civic nationalist ( not in the one european culture fashion , i support the continued existence of all european cultures and languages . ), 
  in favour of a federal europe where all get treated equally righteous . 
  i agree wholeheartedly with this point . 
   even if you achieve all of this and russia becomes a nice and friendly neighbor if russia would archieve such status , we would gladly ( well , i would ) agree to let russia join ue , our problem with russia is with not being nice , not with being russian . 
  if the uk were in position to return to eu after brexit i would happily welcome them back like lost member of family returning to the family , just follow the rules and we will be alright , i 'm not sure about opt outs , personally i would like to see all members of eu without opt outs ( including my country poland ) it should apply to uk too . 
   well , if you didnt want a rivalry how about not annexing our capital for decades ? 
  if you mean rivarly with russia , then u/hipokryzja probably meant [ muscovite -- lithuanian wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muscovite%e2%80%93lithuanian_wars ) and during those wars , we were allies of gdl or that in 1569 ( union of lublin ) we ( or rather king sigismund ii ) took your southern ruthenian lands ( today central/eastern ukraine ) and since of then we had border with russia which had claim to those land , which started series of war ( and sadly we lost those territories ) , etc etc and there you have our rivarly ... 
   to this day poland claims the region belongs to them , and the rivalry continues . 
  do you mean vilnius region , if yes , then do you have proof that poland claims this region ? 
  because if i 'm sure we do n't have such claims ( and we do n't claims either to belarus or ukraine . . so i do n't think that lithuania is exception , most poles supports defending of lithuania from russian agression , and strongest parties which are pis and po are pro-lithuanian ) there was even [ polish national-territorial region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_national-territorial_region ) which our goverment didnt supported . 
  to this day , some of our nationalist are butthurt that our leaders were too soft ( and still are ) then because they ( some nationalist ) who are thinking that if our goverment would be tough , national territorial region would join to poland ( and russia would curbstomp all of us ) .

  if i may ask few quesions , 1 : why are you against of russia nato `` s membership ? 
  2a : what do you think about polish-russian relations ? 
  2b : what do you think about poland ? 
  3 : pis ( current goverment since 2015 and during 2005-2007 but it was coalition with two other parties then ) vs po with psl as coalition partner ( former goverment 2007-2015 ) which one polish goverment was more likeable to you ? 
  true , my bad to forgot/understimate their influence in poland, 
  nah , we 're blaming partially ( ussr was obviously main cuase ) us for leaving us in soviet sphere of influence ( yalta , tehran and thing 's like that ) , sorry if it sounded like that :p, 
  true , but then i would have to add everyone ( and we have already 3 countries and i was replying to romanians so that 's why i mentioned romania ) :p it 's more like ( about closeness of cultures beetwen western and eastern slavs ) czech/slovak -- poles -- ukrainians/belarussians -- russians, 
  i would say that germany is closest `` western european '' culturally country to poland , france would be second though . 
  yes it did got thru and you 're welcome :d, 
   there were russians , the danes and norwegians , the prussians , the saxons , you guys ( for the most part , except for that civil war you guys had when half liked us ) ... everyone but the ottomans . 
  russia was just the main driving force behind it and the ones to steal most land . 
  well about plc-part there is problem , because our king wanted to go war with sweden to gain hereditary land to create dynasty in plc , while sejm vetoed it ( it was sejm competition to declare war and to declare tax-times for szlachta to gather money for army ) so technically plc was neutral part in gnw , and we become of battlefield beetwen both of side, 
  i 'll give you some points . 
  1 : because e.europe is poor 2 : because of sterotype that e.europeans are `` criminals '' steal things , kill people , lot of cursing 3 : because for many e.europe = russia so anti-russian countries do n't want to associate with this , and some feel that their are neglected ( all slavs are russians etc ) 4 : bad blood in history ( countries who were forced to be part of eastern block do n't want to associate with it , poland , czechia , hungary , slovakia , romania etc. . ) 5 : countries who consider themself to be part of western world they think that e.europe is russia-sphere . 
  6 : stereotype that e.europe is orthodox and/or use cyrillic , so latin/catholic oriented countries do n't want to be part of it . 
   bastard russians took our entire empire from us . 
  they took our provinces in estonia and livonia . 
  and then in 1809 , they took half our freaking country . 
  damn russians . 
  well , russians took ( damned partitions ) more than 50 % ( and only because prussia and austria wanted some part too ) of 1619 plc territories :d they love to take someone land russians destroyed our empire too , so we know how you feel bro :(, 
  i used to be guy , who insisted to call poland c.european , but i 'm now chill about poland being/being called eastern european , we are similar to ukrainians and belarussians ( and romanians too , for example our folk/traditional clothes ) in many ways . 
  so ee is not offensive term ( especially when you take a look at borders of plc or second polish republic , it is obvious that we used to be ee :p ) ** edit i 'm not saying that poland is only either ee or ce , i 'm `` now '' used to being called both , ee and ce . 
  but still as part of western world , while more similar to western europe , than ukraine/russia is . 
  tbh , romania , bulgaria , serbia do n't oppose being called e.european too :p, 
   one last question ... would ukraine and turkey be considered as part of the eastern block or eastern europe ? 
  ukraine was both , it was part of ussr ( as ukrainian socialist republic ) , so ukraine belonged to eastern block as part of ussr ( ussr was leader of it ) and eastern slavs ( to whom ukrainians belong ) are 100 % eastern european ( since they are always included in eastern europe ) turkey is not . . turkey was/is part of nato ( western block ) and is located in southern-eastern europe ( only partially ) majority country is in asia . 
   closest thing anyone has ever gotten to succeeding in creating mare nostrum of the north we would have to conquer denmark-norway to create great mare nostrum empire . 
   he gave away part of finland to the russians as a peace treaty for a war they started , you just ca n't do that . 
  finland was ours , muscovy was evil . 
  he gave part of finland ? 
  never heard of that . 
  bastard russians they took [ plenty ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/lietuva_ir_lenkija.lithuania_and_poland_1387.png ) of our [ lithuania ] ( https://static-numista.com/forum/images/57250e6263d46.jpg ), 
  we could n't allow you to take our women ( yep lithuania , we weared pants in that relationship ) , and we won that :p about polish-swedish union it was great idea , but eesti was so attractive that we have fought about it , instead of ganging up on muscovy, 
  if you spare us , we will give to our new overlord , our all hot womens ( we have more of them than sweden and baltics !, 
  i like this country ... 
  [ you share this with lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k%c4%97dainiai )  was an agreement between several magnates of the grand duchy of lithuania and the king of the swedish empire , charles x gustav . 
  it was signed on 20 october 1655 during the `` swedish deluge '' , part of the second northern war . 
  in contrast to the preceding treaty of k\u0117dainiai of 17 august , which put lithuania under swedish protection , the purpose of the swedish-lithuanian union was to end lithuania 's union with poland , and set up two separate principalities in the grand duchy of lithuania . 
  one of these was to be ruled by the radziwi\u0142\u0142 ( radvila ) family , while the rest of the duchy was to remain a swedish protectorate . 
  then , things happened . . 
  tbh and imo , we have more eastern feeling ( and we are more religious ) , we are more similar ( for example , our folk clothes ) to ukraine/belarus ( and russia too , probably ) than czechia ( which is more similar to former-hre area ) about baltic , sweden used to have political interest in that area , and they ( baltic ) have too that germanic ( and protestant too ) - feel which we do n't have . 
  we will annex lithuania ( and latvia and czechia by the way ) then , and force themselves into top 5 list . . no one is going to stop us ! . . 
  well , past is past ( anyway , we blame more us than you for leaving us in soviet sphere during and after ii ww ) , we have promissing future ahead of us about knowledge , the same is here in poland , plenty young ( and older ) people do n't know or remember events from our history ( and thus so foreign ) . 
  ** edit ** adding more us info, 
  can we be also nordic ? ... < cough  we will have inverted danish flag < cough  :d, 
  what about poland , we share catholicism , and we are your biggest minority ? 
  also there 's another thing that it 's hurtful for us poles [ london victory celebrations of 1946 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_victory_celebrations_of_1946 ) it 's sucks to be not invited for such important celebration . 
   ** the parade caused political controversy in the uk and has continued to be criticised because of the lack of representation of polish forces ** . 
  during the war , more than 200,000 members of the polish armed forces in the west had fought under british high command . 
  these were loyal to the polish government-in-exile , were opposed to the soviet union since the time of the nazi-soviet pact and hoped to return to a democratic , non-communist poland after the war . 
  however , by 1946 , the british government changed its diplomatic recognition from the pro-democracy poles in exile to the new communist-dominated provisional government of national unity in poland , where , according to winston churchill and others , totalitarian control was being established .
