  what about being friends with benefits ? 
  well , we do n't learn about lithuania during interbellum , except of our conflicts with lithuanians about wilno/vilnius and that smetona turned lithuania into authoritarian country ( just like poland after 1926 with pi\u0142sudski ), 
  ya , i know :p plenty of importants poles have lithuanian-origins ( and we are grateful for that :d ) , pi\u0142sudski , first president of poland gabriel narutowicz . 
  ( our current chief of ministry of health , is radziwi\u0142\u0142 / radvila ), 
  ussr knew how to use divide et impera rule , throw poles and lithuanians/belarusians/ukrainians ( to show how barbarian is central-eastern europe and that they need `` strong master to keep balance ) at each other throats , and to interfere later ( just like in crimea and donbas ), 
  well , lithuania could have become bilingual country ( with polish and lithuania as national languages ) allowing wilno/vilnius to be part of restored lithuania . 
   my lithuanian friend told me that most of the polish in lithuania are just polonized lithuanians . 
  well , s/he 's probably right , most poles from `` eastern borderlands '' were polonized lithuanians/ruthenians . 
   and they really did n't want to go the route of having a border dispute with poland , that declaring the continuation of 1939 republic would have caused . 
  i do n't think , that we , poles would like to have vilnius restored at that moment ( especially with former eastern germans territories being part of iii rp ) , our goverments during 90 's wanted to have best relations with our eastern neighbour as possible . 
  i 'm not polish nation ( just myself ) , but i would like to apologize for taking vilnius from you . 
  it was assholish move :p, 
  well according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilnius#in_poland )  the lithuanian-speaking population at the time was a small minority , at about 6 % of the city 's population according even to contemporary lithuanian sources ** the council of ambassadors and the international community ( with the exception of lithuania ) recognized polish sovereignty over vilnus region in 1923 ** according to lithuania it was occupation , according to international [ community it was polish territory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_central_lithuania_general_election,_1922 ) . 
   the parliament gathered on 1 february 1922 . 
  on 20 february it voted for formal incorporation into poland and dispatched a delegation to poland . 
  the polish sejm passed the law proposed by the central lithuanian parliament on 22 march 1922 and two days later the republic of central lithuania ceased to exist . 
  all of its territory was incorporated into the newly formed wilno voivodeship . 
  ** the border changes were accepted by the conference of ambassadors of the entente and the league of nations . 
  lithuania declined to accept the polish authority over the area and continued to treat the region as part of its own territory and vilnius as its legitimate capital ** , with kaunas designated only as a temporary seat of government . 
  the polish -- lithuanian diplomatic relations were not restored until the polish ultimatum to lithuania in 1938 . 
  about demographics  1897 : according to the first census in the russian empire , in 1897 population of vilnius was 154,500 . 
  the largest groups at the time were jews ( 61,847 ) and poles ( 47,795 ) . 
  other groups included russians ( 30,967 ) , belarusians ( 6,514 ) and ukrainians ( 517 ) , lithuanians ( 3,131 ) , germans ( 2,170 ) , tartars ( 722 ) and latvians ( 184 ) . 
  ***  1916 : according to the census of 14 december 1916 by the occupying german forces at the time , there were a total of 138,794 inhabitants in vilnius . 
  this number was made up of the following nationalities : poles 53.67 % ( 74,466 inhabitants ) , jews 41.45 % ( 57,516 inhabitants ) , lithuanians 2.09 % ( 2,909 inhabitants ) , russians 1.59 % ( 2,219 inhabitants ) , germans 0.63 % ( 880 inhabitants ) , belarusians 0.44 % ( 644 inhabitants ) and others at 0.13 % ( 193 inhabitants ) . 
  ** i 'm not saying that poland was right one , in conflict with lithuania ( for them vilnius is like warsaw/krak \u00f3w for poles ) , it was assholish move ( just like crimea was ) but it was interbellum poland ( quite nationalistic state then ) , not most friendly place in europe ** :p ** still international community recognized polish rule over vilnius ( not saying that it was right move ) **, 
  then finland , greece , austria ( and eastern germany ) are eastern european too . 
  edit : maybe , sweden too . . 
  zygmunt august took it to the next level in 1569 !, 
  maybe later , maybe later ... hope so . . 
  ** ironically ** , they consider themselves to be fan of old-sld ( new sld sucked due to miller ) kwa\u015bniewski and cimoszewisz and ( so left wing ) , also they consider prl to be good time , while at the same time loving putin ( right wing ) and having some `` sympathy '' to trump ( because negros are bad etc and other `` racist '' arguments ), 
  my femine side of family hates ukrainians ( i 'm ukrainophile side :p ) due to `` xenophobic reasons '' ( just like xix century racist hated black people , ** lazy , stealing bastards , do n't know english/polish , bad mentality , stole jobs from poles , ugly prostitutes , drunkards ** . 
  russia is da best . 
  crimea is russian , let 's take lviv/lw \u00f3w etc. . lithuanians are bad too ... and many other nations except of russians ) they were pissed , when they [ heard plan about 500 + ] ( http://www.portalspozywczy.pl/technologie/wiadomosci/ukraincy-latwiej-znajda-prace-i-szybciej-uzyskaja-pobyt-staly,139495.html ) for ukrainians , to encourage them to go to / stay in poland, 
  well , my femine side of family hates ukrainians ( i 'm ukrainophile side :p ) due to `` xenophobic reasons '' ( just like xix century racist hated black people , lazy , bad mentality , stole jobs , ugly , russia is da best , crimea is russian , let 's take lviv/lw \u00f3w etc. . lithuanians are bad too ... ** and many other nations except of russians ** ), 
  then you are welcome to visit my house :d ** my `` female '' side of family , hates ukrainians ** . . 
  holandia/holland is only unofficial name :p niderlandy/netherlands is formal version ( kr\u00f3lestwo niderland\u00f3w ), 
   in polish ( holandia ) , dannish ( holland ) , icelandic ( holland ) and few other languages it 's the official name of the entire country , not just erroneous reference . 
  tbh , ** holandia ** ( holland ) is only uformal `` version '' official/formal one would be kr\u00f3lestwo ** niderland\u00f3w ** ( netherlands ), 
   singapore , hong kong , taiwan i would say , japanese or koreans :p ( and maybe chinese too ), 
   most young poles see west and east as evil forces . 
  in their eyes poland is one of the last bastion of european culture free of liberal propaganda . 
  older people , perhaps ... young poles ? 
  no way , they are pro-western group ( as most of poles ) in poland . 
  [ for example , about 80 % young poles have positive opinion of eu ] ( https://proline.pl/?n=mlodzi-polacy-ufaja-unii-bardziej-niz-inni-europejczycy ) [ even here , there is clear majority , in worst case , 60 % young poles have positive opinion of eu ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/polska/mlodzi-polacy-sa-antyeuropejscy-dlaczego-mlodzi-nie-chca-ue,artykuly,391584,1.html ) and quazi-nazi agent . 
  that 's hilarious , only some `` delusional '' right-winger would write such thing ( evil germans , evil eu ) ... young poles ( and poles generally ) are not anti-western ( they do n't consider it to be evil ) ,, 
  to be honest , we do n't know what kind of eu pis ( they can not decide what eu is , good or bad thing ) , would like to have . . they say that they want eu to be `` confederation '' , but with united military ( rather , federation thing ) and obviously money for `` poor parts '' ... 
  yes , you are right , ukrainian one also look similar . 
  polish and russian ones , look like sisters to me :d, 
  great ~ ~ western slavic ~ ~ slovakian emprah ? 
  technically , our sejm/seimas and king agreed on foursome ! . . 
  what about hetalia ? , i think rule 34 is king/queen there , and there are poland ( or plc ) , prussia , austria/habsburg and russia !, 
  what a weird-greek name ... 
  they were small , but in their heart , they were largest and strongest, 
  deal !, 
  your arguments sounds convincing ( i guess so ) to me , i would say , that i agree with you :d, 
  [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_b%c3%a1thory )  with lithuania secure , the other major region refusing to recognize his election was prussia . 
  maximilian 's sudden death improved b\u00e1thory 's situation , but the city of danzig ( gda\u0144sk ) still refused to recognize his election without significant concessions . 
  the hanseatic league city , bolstered by its immense wealth , fortifications , and the secret support of maximilian , had supported the emperor 's election and decided not to recognize b\u00e1thory as legitimate ruler . 
  the resulting conflict was known as the danzig rebellion . 
  most armed opposition collapsed when the prolonged siege of danzig by b\u00e1thory 's forces was lifted as an agreement was reached . 
  the danzig army was utterly defeated in a field battle on 17 april 1577 . 
  however , since b\u00e1thory 's armies were unable to take the city by force , a compromise was reached . 
  in exchange for some of danzig 's demands being favorably reviewed , the city recognised b\u00e1thory as ruler of poland and paid the sum of 200,000 zlotys in gold as compensation.tying up administration of the commonwealth northern provinces , in february 1578 he acknowledged george frederick as the ruler of duchy of prussia , receiving his feudal tribute, 
  maybe you are right that lw\u00f3w was more polish , than danzig german , perpahs it was rash comparison :p but danzig had decent `` autonomy '' and sometimes caused problems ( for example when gdansk did n't recognized stefan batory ), 
  i will end this puny dispute !, 
  ! , i shall give belgium ( and netherlands ... and france ) to friends of ours , germany . 
  if i remember correctly , in plc was case that citizens ( all of them , not only ethnic poles ) of crown ( proper poland ) were called `` crowners/koroniarze / '' and citizens of gdl `` lithuanians/litwini '' adam mickiewicz used those `` terms '' in pan tadeusz, 
  i would compare lw\u00f3w to gda\u0144sk ( both of them were lost by their current owners in xiv century due to conquests , and after that used to be major place of culture , lw\u00f3w / lviv for poles , gda\u0144sk / danzig for germans ), 
  we need moar glorious latin town names !!, 
  do n't worry my friend !, 
  i 'm ( completely ) against revisionism :d ** vilnius is yours !, 
  ( and always was yours , it was stupid and rash thing , that we took it by force in interbellum period , it would be like taking krak\u00f3w / warszawa/pozna \u0144 from poland ) **, 
  nah , with french ( revolution and other things ... ) well , queen of france ( and dead one ) was sister of king habsburg monarchy :d, 
  currently ukrainian bratlav / \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0446\u043b\u0430\u0432 = used to polish/brac \u0142aw / braclav currently ukrainian mukacheve / \u041c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0435 , = used to be czech/slovak-muka \u010devo german/munkatsch hungarian/munk \u00e1cs currently slovakian ko\u0161ice = used to be hungarian/kassa german / kaschau latin/cassovia, 
  you mean pre-lublin union borders ? ... 
  in that case i completely agree . 
  i would say , that prussians got best bite in competition of getting best part of `` plc cake '' as one philosopher said :p ( say hello voltaire ), 
  what about uncle sam or her majesty uk ? 
  :d i forgot to add , japan, 
  i thought that by three superpowers , he meant ussr , germany , us ( or maybe uk ), 
  yep , that 's true about plc , but was n't only `` crown of poland '' being partitioned in three parts ? 
  gdl was partitioned by prussia ( i 'm not sure about them ) and russia but not by habsburg monarchy/austria, 
   world 's three superpowers i think that in 1939 , there were more superpowers than just three :p, 
  that 's pretty `` god '' one picture , i like it !, 
  unfortunately not . 
  if we had winged hussars here , it would be even more polish picture ( over 9000 being polish level ) . . 
  polish picture without kie\u0142basa ?
