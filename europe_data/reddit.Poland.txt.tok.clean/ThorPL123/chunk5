   hah , thanks !, 
   law , history and geography are my things too . 
   history is great thing !, 
  i also forgot to mention biology and english too ( it took time for me to like it ) . 
  law was my weak spot in wos where i prefered politcs and history aspects . 
  but currently i 'm learning about civic and administrative law . 
   i never learned spanish in school . 
  i guess understanding spanish/italian is for me like it will be for you to understand serbian/bulgarian . 
  i do n't unsterstand anything of bulgarian ( it 's sounds so different ) , and only some/few world of serbian that seems like polish :d, 
  and serbia is russian !, 
  that would make kosovo legit russian claim . 
   i kinda was forced to learn two languages since i 'm a minority in romania . 
  i quess hungarian ? 
   i can understand written spanish , i used to learn spanish ( and german ) but my skill in using it/them is close to 0 % i wasted 3 years of education on spanish , since i do n't know to much except some words and grammar rules . 
   i hate physics and math too . 
   i know your feel , myself i liked geograpghy , polish ( language about literature and other things ) history and wos ( wiedza o spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie-knowledge about society , some law , some domestic politics , some foreign politics , knowledge about world , history etc ), 
   but i barely can write in my native one correctly hahaha :d my writing skill is the same as dancing ... they do n't exist or if they do , they are worse than the ten plagues . .  ** i know three languages and i understand quite well another two-four . 
  ** god damnit !, 
  o_o  looks like i 've found my soulmate !, 
  \u2661 \u2661 \u2661 thanks !, 
  and maybe it 's the same from my side ( dunno :d ), 
   i 'm a wiki student too ( sometimes ) but i never go into linguistics . 
  that 's worse than chemistry for me and i really suck at chemistry ... no , really , i 'm very bad at chemistry lolol well , wikipedia is good place to learn :p if you meant that i 'm into linqustics then i probably put this into bad words because i 'm quite bad at this ( i know only my native language and pretty okay enligsh but only that ) i was bad at chemistry too , i hated also physics and maths ( darn them !, 
   you must be a languages student or professor . 
  nah , rather student of wikipedia :d myself i 'm more interested into history and politcs ( more foreign and military aspects ) and many others . . 
  yes and it 's seems lovely . 
  it 's seems that germanic languages love that sound too  the great majority of germanic languages , such as german , dutch , icelandic , swedish , danish and norwegian , use \u27e8 j \u27e9 for the palatal approximant / j / , which is usually represented by the letter \u27e8 y \u27e9 in english . 
  notable exceptions are english , scots and ( to a lesser degree ) luxembourgish . 
  \u27e8 j \u27e9 also represents / j / in albanian , and those uralic , slavic and baltic languages that use the latin alphabet , such as hungarian , finnish , estonian , polish , czech , serbo-croatian , slovak , latvian and lithuanian . 
  some related languages , such as serbo-croatian and macedonian , also adopted \u27e8 j \u27e9 into the cyrillic alphabet for the same purpose . 
  because of this standard , the lower case letter was chosen to be used in the ipa as the phonetic symbol for the sound . 
  we have the best j !, 
  [ it 's seems pretty fine and normal :d ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plik:polish_letter_j.ogg ), 
   this is not the plc , it did n't exist at the time . 
  well , if we include that there is border of plc , we could said that plc is part of this map :p, 
   most modern states in europe were created in the 19th century as part of larger national movements and fall or weakening of various empires who occupied them . 
  those `` argument '' are not meant be reasonable and correct but used to excuse imperialism and lust for expansion ( mainly territories that used to be theirs ) in their views, 
  yeah i wrote about it  but still with rich history ** and many tries to create it earlier ** unfortunately for ukrainians , those states were short-lived and quickly were ripped by it 's neighbours ( poland and ussr included ) . 
   the people decide to in a democratic referendum of each separate region . 
  i agree with that , if that 's their decision they have right to take it  that excludes military takeovers first like in crimea i agree with that too :p our nationalist would love to join by military means part of ukraine , belarus , lithuania ( since there are not polish minorities or are too small except of lithuania one ), 
  well for some nationalist pole ( i can not say about other nationalities ) , it means that since ukraine never existed before 1989 , those territories are either polish , romanian , hungarian and russian stolen territory that must be returned to their rightfuls owners . 
  probably it 's jab at ukraine being young country ( but still with rich history and many tries to create it earlier ) and blah blah ukraine did n't existed before 1991 etc. 
  that 's not whataboutism , because poland had same pact with ussr ( and it was done earlier than with germany , he used shiity argument to defend his precious country ) . 
   how horrible , soviets should pay poles royalties for copyright breach ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german\u2013polish_non-aggression_pact hur dur wonder why you didnt ' mentioned [ this ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact )  the german -- polish non-aggression pact ( german : deutsch-polnischer nichtangriffspakt ; polish : polsko-niemiecki pakt o nieagresji ) ** was an international treaty between nazi germany and the second polish republic , signed on january 26 , 1934 **  the soviet -- polish non-aggression pact ( polish : polsko-radziecki pakt o nieagresji , russian : pakt o nenapadenii mezhdu sssr i pol 's hey ) ** was an international treaty of non-aggression signed in 1932 by representatives of poland and the ussr ** . 
  the pact was unilaterally broken by the soviet union on september 17 , 1939 , during the german and soviet invasion of poland .

   bene\u0160 to mo\u015acicki  mr. president !, 
  prague , 22 . ix . 
  1938  at a time when the fate of europe is at stake and when two of our nations are keenly interested in building a lasting basis for sincere cooperation between the two countries , i turn to his excellency proposing to establish friendly relations and new co-operation between poland and czechoslovakia . 
   i am therefore presenting , on behalf of the czechoslovak state , the excellency , the proposal of a sincere and friendly alignment of our different points of view on matters concerning the problem of the polish population in czechoslovakia . 
  i would like to put this matter at the heart of the principle of border rectification . 
  consistency in our mutual relations will , of course , be the logical and immediate consequence of this agreement . 
  if we reach an agreement and i am sure it will be possible - i would consider it to be the beginning of a new era in relations between our two countries . 
   i would like to add as former foreign minister and current president of the republic that czechoslovakia has neither at present nor ever had any obligations or treaties , secret or public , whose meaning , purpose or intent would harm the interests of poland . 
   i confidently submit this proposal to your excellency with the consent of the responsible ministers at the same time to give it the character of a lasting agreement . 
   i would like to make this matter of interest exclusively to our two states . 
   knowing the delicacy of our mutual relations and realizing how difficult it was in ordinary times to fix them with ordinary diplomatic and political means , i am trying to seize the current crisis to remove the obstacles that have taken place in the past decades and to immediately create a new atmosphere . 
  i do it in full honesty . 
  i am convinced that the future of our two nations and their future mutual cooperation must be finally assured . 
   please accept the excellency the words of my deepest sympathy . 
  bene\u0160 ***  czech minister of foreign affairs to polish ambassador pap\u00c9e  nr 139.350 / ii-1 38  prague , september 30 , 1938  mr. minister !, 
   i have read the note of september 27 , in which your excellency proposes , on behalf of your government , the conclusion of an immediate agreement regulating the disputes between our two countries , and in particular the territory of the people of polish nationality . 
   the czechoslovak government is grateful to the government of the republic of poland for expressing its views on the manner in which the czechoslovak government views the desired agreement . 
   desiring that this agreement be lasting and leaving no side of both sides feeling bitter , the czechoslovak government allows itself to propose the following procedure , stating that for the reasons to be mentioned , would like to avoid the czechoslovak society getting the impression that it uses the difficulty in which czechoslovakia is currently located is precisely at the moment when the question of territory inhabited by the german population is resolved . 
  the czechoslovak government would like to emphasize that this is an act of goodwill arising from its own initiative and its own decision . 
  he considers this to be very important for relations between the two peoples and both states in the future , the relations that they would like to be most friendly . 
   first of all , the czechoslovak government allows us to notice that in negotiations on the german population in the republic we were forced to reject both the plebiscite and the territorial assignments before the final determination of the borders . 
  for these reasons , the czechoslovak government can not depart from this principle also in the case of poland , the more that it could become a precedent in resolving the question of the german sudeten , which would not lie in the intentions of the government of the republic of poland . 
   starting from these assumptions , the czechoslovak government allows itself to present the following principles for resolving this issue . 
  the government of czechoslovakia solemnly assures the government of poland that the rectification of the borders and subsequent transfer of the area to be determined by the proceeding will be carried out in all circumstances , regardless of the international situation . 
  the czechoslovak republic is also ready to make a statement on this matter to france and the united kingdom , and to recognize both of them as guarantors of the agreement . 
  the area of the area would be based on the principle that these districts would be territorially divided according to the ratio of the polish population to the czech one . 
  a quantitatively established polish-czechoslovak committee would be created immediately to develop a detailed procedure on the basis of this principle . 
  it could be convened on october 5 , 1938 . 
  the commission would shape the issue of housing options , resettlement and exchange of bilateral populations , and all the economic and financial issues that come with it . 
  a deadline should be set for the commission to complete its work . 
  we propose october 31 . 
  a deadline should be set for the acquisition of land . 
  this deadline would be fixed by adopting two final limits : date as close as possible and as far as possible . 
  the joint communiqu\u00e9 could immediately inform the polish and czechoslovak society that an agreement was reached on the principles of the polish-czechoslovak agreement on border rectification and that the whole procedure would be completed within a time limit agreed by both parties . 
  in order not to leave any doubt about the agreement and on the strong will that both governments bring to life , the commission , as stated above , will commence work no later than october 5 , and the acquisition of the area may take place no sooner than october 31 and no later than december 1 - the date on which the competent committee will quit . 
  december 1 deadline should not be exceeded . 
   the czechoslovak government is of the opinion that it is an order that is so precise , concrete and resolute that it can be accepted and implemented in a spirit of good will and understanding . 
   i believe that on this basis we can come to an agreement that will provide both nations in the future with the conviction that the conflict has finally been resolved , and that there is no reason for bitterness between them , nor the accusation that also in other political problems will arise immediately between the two you have an atmosphere whereby their friendly cooperation will be fully ensured . 
   please accept our '' respect . '', 
  dr. k. krofta ***  then why only czechs back stabbed you in 1920 , why not the other allies too ? 
  it 's still czech land , to this day . 
  i mean when they attacked poland it seems that i was wrong about war with soviets , they attacked when we were in war with [ western ukrainians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland-czechoslovakia_war )  the czechoslovak government in prague requested that the poles cease their preparations for elections to the polish sejm in the area that had been designated polish in the interim agreement as no sovereign rule was to be executed in the disputed areas . 
  the polish government declined and czechoslovak units attacked the polish part of cieszyn silesia to prevent the elections in the contested territory . 
  [ 1 ] the attack was halted under pressure from the entente . 
  the result of the war was the new demarcation line , which expanded the territory controlled by czechoslovakia . 
  it led to the division of the region of cieszyn silesia in july 1920 , and left a substantial polish minority in czechoslovakia in the region later called zaolzie . 
  the division of cieszyn silesia did not satisfy poland and led to the polish annexation of zaolzie in 1938 . 
  it 's not a story the pole would tell you . 
  [ do you mean krakow and legend about wawel dragon ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wawel_dragon )  the wawel dragon ( polish : smok wawelski ) , also known as the dragon of wawel hill , is a famous dragon in polish folklore . 
  his lair was in a cave at the foot of wawel hill on the bank of the vistula river . 
  wawel hill is in krak\u00f3w , which was then the capital of poland . 
  in some stories the dragon lived before the founding of the city , when the area was inhabited by farmers .
