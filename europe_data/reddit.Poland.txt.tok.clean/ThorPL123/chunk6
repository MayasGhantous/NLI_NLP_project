   wawel cathedral and krak\u00f3w 's wawel castle stand on wawel hill . 
  in front of the entrance to the cathedral there are bones of pleistocene creatures hanging on a chain , which were found and carried to the cathedral in medieval times as the remains of a dragon . 
  it is believed that the world will come to its end when the bones will fall on the ground . 
  the cathedral features a statue of the wawel dragon and a plaque commemorating his defeat by krakus , a polish prince who , according to the plaque , founded the city and built his palace over the slain dragon 's lair . 
  the dragon 's cave below the castle is now a popular tourist stop . 
  ours kinda sucked in some area too , they lost `` kinda big part '' of lithuania to muscovy and lost oportunities to take for example silesia or crushing teutonic order/duchy of prussia and joining it 's land into kingdom of poland . 
  also jagiellons sucked in teamwork unlike hapsburgs, 
   the jagiellonian dynasty was a royal dynasty , founded by jogaila , the grand duke of lithuania , who in 1386 was baptized as w\u0142adys\u0142aw , married queen regnant ( also styled `` king '' ) jadwiga of poland , and was crowned king of poland as w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii jagie\u0142\u0142o . 
  the dynasty reigned in several central european countries between the 14th and 16th centuries . 
  members of the dynasty were kings of poland ( 1386 -- 1572 ) , grand dukes of lithuania ( 1377 -- 1392 and 1440 -- 1572 ) , kings of hungary ( 1440 -- 1444 and 1490 -- 1526 ) , and kings of bohemia ( 1471 -- 1526 ) . 
   the personal union between the kingdom of poland and the grand duchy of lithuania ( converted in 1569 with the treaty of lublin into the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ) is the reason for the common appellation `` poland -- lithuania '' in discussions about the area from the late middle ages onward . 
  one jagiellonian briefly ruled both poland and hungary ( 1440 -- 44 ) , and two others ruled both bohemia and hungary ( 1490 -- 1526 ) and then continued in the distaff line as a branch of the house of habsburg . 
   the polish `` golden age '' , the period of the reigns of sigismund i and sigismund ii , the last two jagiellonian kings , or more generally the 16th century , is most often identified with the rise of the culture of polish renaissance . 
  the cultural flowering had its material base in the prosperity of the elites , both the landed nobility and urban patriciate at such centers as cracow and danzig .

  thanks , til !, 
  from now you are your best friend forever, 
  wait , what ? 
  why did it show my profile ? 
  probably mistakes on the map , about date i do n't know because map lack information about modern date ( there is only information that borders are modern ), 
   ** a political storm has erupted in poland after mps from its ruling conservative party suggested sweeping changes to the country 's supreme court . 
  **  the law and justice ( pis ) government argued that changes are needed to reform an inefficient and sometimes corrupt judicial system , according to public broadcaster tvp . 
   but the opposition has called the planned reform a `` coup d'etat '' and claimed pis wants to stack the court with its own candidates . 
   grzegorz schetyna , the leader of civic platform ( po ) , poland 's main opposition party , said : `` its about pis being able to introduce dictatorial government '' . 
   five former constitutional tribunal judges have issued a joint statement calling on president andrzej duda and mps to block the changes , saying they could `` permanently deprive poland of the position of a democratic state governed by the rule of law '' . 
   european commissioner pierre moscovici said the changes would not be tolerated . 
   poland 's former justice minister borys budka , currently a po mp , said the changes would mean the supreme court , which is charged with confirming election results , could invalidate them if pis were to lose . 
   but pis mp marcin hora\u0142a has said that the reform would guarantee the separation of powers and ensure a system of checks and balances . 
   pis said the broad-reaching changes would effectively create a new supreme court . 
   it added that only `` highly qualified '' and `` ethical '' people could become judges and that the court would `` enjoy more authority and the trust of citizens '' . 
   pis supporters have criticised polish courts for taking too long to hear cases , and have accused judges of being an elite , self-serving clique often out of touch with the problems of ordinary citizens . 
   poland is already embroiled in a row with brussels over pis 's sweeping changes to the constitutional tribunal and concerns about the rule of law , which caused bitter divisions in poland and concern abroad . 
   the supreme court was founded in 1917 as the groundwork for poland 's judicial system was being laid ahead of the country regaining independence after more than a hundred years of foreign occupation .

   last month , the commission decided to launch procedures against poland , the czech republic and hungary for failing to take in migrants from camps in southern europe , which brussels said was against eu laws . 
   the countries were given a month to respond . 
   poland 's interior ministry has said there are `` systemic deficiencies in the ... relocation mechanism , which makes it impossible to guarantee security '' . 
   interior minister mariusz b\u0142aszczak , who signed the letter to brussels , said : `` it is a mechanism ... which brings new waves of migrants '' . 
   `` my reasoning is security , '' he added . 
  `` security is [ a matter of ] national policy and not of community policy '' . 
   the interior ministry said that poland does not reject the eu 's principle of solidarity , but that it was concerned about insufficient security checks on migrants and said aid should be sent to their countries of origin . 
   it added that separating economically motivated migrants from asylum seekers and fighting people-smuggling were other issues that needed to be addressed . 
   in september 2015 , eu leaders agreed that each country would accept a number of migrants over two years to alleviate the pressure on greece and italy , which have seen the arrival of tens of thousands of people from the middle east and africa . 
   eu leaders , including poland 's previous government , agreed to relocate a total of about 100,000 migrants of more than two million people who arrived in europe since 2015 . 
   but since coming to power in october 2015 , poland 's conservative law and justice ( pis ) government has staunchly opposed the arrangement . 
   only 14,000 migrants from refugee camps in countries along the mediterranean coast have been relocated to eu countries .

   angband i did n't expected morgoth here . 
  nah , it 's just some map to show eastern europe how looked there ( in 17th century ) and how it looks now :p, 
  prussia is included in plc , line that excludes it = border of modern countires, 
  borders on map are from 1619 [ when gained territory of russia like smole\u0144sk , but some of parts were returned to tsardom of russia in 1634 , on the map you can see that plc after 1619 had larger territory `` showed by lighter orange and pink colours '' than after 1634 `` showed by red line '' ] ( http://pomoce-dydaktyczne.com.pl/776-1621-thickbox/mapa-scienna-historyczna-rzeczpospolita-od-polowy-xvi-wieku-do-polowy-xvii-wieku-140x100cm.jpg ) -1621 ( de facto loss of livonia , de jure in 1660 ) period most of ukraine and part of modern russia were lost in 1667 ( kyiv was supposed to be returned after 2 years , but things happened ), 
   i do n't think invading and annexing part of a country makes them entirely innocent . 
  that 's true , but then all political parties supported taking back zaolzie ( goverment , left and right wing oposition ) , also `` ozon and/or sanacja '' goverment feared that germans would use it to exchange it for danzig , they wanted to prevent it, 
   ... and yet the young austrian fucker survived . 
   the irony . . well in thas case , someone other would take role that hitler had in otl, 
   let 's start a war , start a nuclear war , homogay nuclear weapons !? . . 
   wink you could say that it 's both literally and metaphorically at the same time . . 
  with such weapon of mass destruction all of us are fucked ... 
   by the end of the war there were whole towns and villages where only women , children and old men were left alive well , if you were one of last young man ( let 's say few ) that survived , you were in pretty good position in courting :p, 
  we are not talking about boats ! / s, 
   you shall see how swedes made us homogay . 
  if you are homogay , you are safe from russia , thats ultimate weapon against russian imperialism . 
  okay with such anti-boner choices , i will go to your prisoner camp there is possiblity that i will survive and will return to now lithuanian piase\u010dnas and var\u0161uvos . 
  i can be eternal prisoner to your attractive/pretty ladies . 
  that would be pretty good !, 
  well , that would n't be nice , there are rules during warfare time !, 
  shots were fired ! . . 
  and you are going to regret this ! . . 
  hmmph . . let 's find good date hmmph ... 1795 best day of my live . . 
  if we can not beat you , then we will sink you with us !, 
  1619 best day of my life . 
  also it 's painful and sad to see that some people believe that we should n't get eastern german lands , if it were done ( and we would eastern lands ) we would be small country with no reperations , ( and still under influence of ussr ) overpopulation ( since our population would have to fit into 200 thousand of km ) , destroyed country and millions peope dead and we would be fucked even if were victims of war . 
  czechoslovakia did the same , they give up territories and got swallowed anyway , our fate would be the same if we did similar thing ( why stop only at danzig , maybe silesia or great poland too just to stop war ? 
  or you are selfish cunts that want to doom europe ) . 
  since 1569 , most of territory of modern ukraine ( western ukraine belonged to poland since mid of 14th century ) were part of crown , but during time of war with russia , plc wanted to break cossack-russia ties , so plan of treaty of hadiach was created another thing is that magnates there belonged to one of most powerful persons in country and central power was weak there . 
   the treaty of hadiach ( polish : ugoda hadziacka ; ukrainian : \u0433\u0430\u0434\u044f\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440 ) was a treaty signed on 16 september 1658 in hadiach ( hadziacz , hadiacz , \u0413\u0430\u0434\u044f\u0447 ) between representatives of the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ( represented by s. bieniewski and k. jew\u0142aszewski ) and ukrainian cossacks ( represented by hetman ivan vyhovsky and starshina ( sztarszyna , the elders ) yuri nemyrych , architect of the treaty , and pavlo teteria ) . 
  it was designed to elevate the cossacks and ruthenians to the position equal to that of poland and lithuania in the polish -- lithuanian union and in fact transforming the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth into a polish -- lithuanian -- ruthenian commonwealth ( rzeczpospolita trojga narod\u00f3w , `` commonwealth of three nations '' ) . 
  unlucky for us it failed and we lost central ukraine to kyiv ( well , russians were supposed to keep kyiv for 2 years and give it then ), 
  hindusi as plural form , hindus as male , hinduska is female and hindi ( and many other language ) is language, 
   the us absolutely had the money to do it , since it actually refinanced germany 's versailles reparations under the dawes and later , the young plan . 
  while probably they had the money , i do n't think that they would want this , since isolationist influences were too strong in society of us , that 's why didnt ' us joined to league of nations . 
  and that was kind of sad .
