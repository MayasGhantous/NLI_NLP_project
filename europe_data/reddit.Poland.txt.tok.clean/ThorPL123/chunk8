  we were not quasi-dictatorship , but full dictatorship :p czechia took this part ( zaolzie ) earlier , when were struggling for survive in 1920 , if we failed we would end like czechslovakia in 1938 , maybe it 's karma ? 
   but yeah , we fucked up with this action , we should aid czechoslovakia , instead of that we made ourselves tomb . 
   actually , poland was back in 1806 , only after treaties of tilsit in 1807 duchy of warsaw was created , also we made uprsing in greater poland to greet napoleon ( we were one of most loyal allies of napoleon and we stayed loyal to the end ), 
  its like other national internets , plenty of hot girls with nice boobs , lot of cats and other memes , political arguments , shitposting etc. ... just in polish ( gj captain obvious ), 
   the recovered territories do n't morally belong to poland any more just because poland lost territories in the east . 
  well , ussr took our eastern lands so in exchange ( since they were deciding power with us and uk ) they punished germany by taking their eastern lands for poland ( stalin thought that it will make poland and germany forever enemies , and poland will be eternal ally of ussr ) also they took eastern prussia region ( that was meant to be part of poland , since ussr wanted it , we got szczecin area in exchange and they got konigsberg voila ) to make their influence stronger , just like they took lw\u00f3w / lviv area that was n't russian earlier just to have gun pointed at hungary and romania and to make relations beetwen poles and ukrainians more hostile . 
  just geopolitics from pov of ussr . 
   yeah their current government is somewhat fucked up but as people we all get along pretty well . 
  we can hope that they will be kicked in nextion elections out of goverment and centrist pro-eu oposition will win ( po+n . + psl ) . 
   you have not one , but two blue eyes white dragons ? 
  as president of kaiba corp i declare this invalid, 
   those lands that you would conquer before hand , we could go back and forth until we reach the dawn of man but what happened in 980-1450 is not relevant when talking about modern times , we can agree to disagree my friend , since we have different opinions . 
   were german and were happy being german until they were pushed out . 
  that was price that germans had to pay for millions of killed poles and ruining our country , nobody forced germany to invade poland they got what deserved . 
  also it was ussr that took those lands to replace polish lost territories and war losses that were taken by ussr . 
   but the eastern border of poland is n't germany 's problem and the weimar republic 's eastern border was determined by plebiscites where the people of those areas very clearly expressed which country they wanted to belong to i do n't think that it was germany problem , i was talking about countries that decided to make those changes after 1945 . 
  ( us , uk , ussr ), 
  and earlier were polish . . for example gda\u0144sk / so called danzig  the first written record thought to refer to gda\u0144sk is the vita of saint adalbert . 
  written in 999 , it describes how in 997 saint adalbert of prague baptised the inhabitants of urbs gyddannyzc , `` which separated the great realm of the duke [ i.e. 
  boleslaw the brave of poland ] from the sea . '', 
  no further written sources exist for the 10th and 11th centuries . 
  based on the date in adalbert 's vita , the city celebrated its millennial anniversary in 1997 . 
   archaeological evidence for the origins of the town was retrieved mostly after world war ii had laid 90 percent of the city center in ruins , enabling excavations.the oldest seventeen settlement levels were dated to between 980 and 1308 . 
  it is generally thought that mieszko i of poland erected a stronghold on the site in the 980s , thereby connecting the polish state ruled by the piast dynasty with the trade routes of the baltic sea . 
  traces of buildings and housing from 10th century have been found in archaeological excavations of the city . 
  it 's germans who took our territories and used germanisation on them ( it seems when germans are doing this it 's okay but when poles are doing it 's very bad and they stealing their own territoy ... ) , and later we took what was ours ( gda\u0144sk was part of polish part of plc to second partition in 1793 ) . 
   according to that measure poland and the frg would have been best friends since the 1970s , you mean willy brandt ? 
  well , that 's true that he apologized , but many poles believe that he apologized for holocaust and jews and not poland for war crimes . 
   which has more to do with the german government acting like an ass towards the eastern eu tbf nah , with goverment like pis it isnt ' weird that our relations are bad since of those arsholes actions . 
   teutonic orders that stoled territories from poland like gda\u0144sk and pomeralia ? 
  yeah totally legit . 
   in 1308 , the town was taken by brandenburg and the teutonic knights were hired by the polish prince ( later king ) w\u0142adys\u0142aw i the elbow-high to restore order . 
  subsequently , the knights took over control of the town . 
  primary sources record a massacre carried out by the teutonic knights on the local population , of 10,000 people , but the exact number killed is subject of dispute in modern scholarship . ], 
  some authors accept the number given in the original sources , while others consider 10,000 to have been a medieval exaggeration , although scholarly consensus is that a massacre of some magnitude did take place . 
  the events were used by the polish crown to condemn the teutonic knights in a subsequent papal lawsuit . 
  ***  the city of danzig ( gda\u0144sk ) was captured by the state of the teutonic order on 13 november 1308 , resulting in a great victory for the order and marking the beginning of tensions between poland and the teutonic order . 
  originally the knights moved into the fortress as an ally of poland against the margraviate of brandenburg . 
  however , after disputes over the control of the city between the order and the king of poland arose , the knights murdered a number of citizens within the city and took it as their own . 
  thus the event is also known as gda\u0144sk massacre or gda\u0144sk slaughter ( rze\u017a gda\u0144ska ) . 
  though in the past , a matter of debate among historians , a consensus has been established that many people were murdered and a considerable part of the town was destroyed in the context of the take-over . 
   in the aftermath of the take-over , the order seized all of pomerelia ( gda\u0144sk pomerania ) and bought up the supposed brandenburgian claims to the region in the treaty of soldin ( 1309 ) . 
  the conflict with poland was temporarily settled in the treaty of kalisz ( 1343 ) . 
  the town was returned to poland in the peace of toru\u0144 in 1466 . 
  thats true , the katowice urban area in largest urban area , but katowice itself are not biggest city in poland so it 's wierd not see cities like krak\u00f3w ( second city with biggest population , former capital etc ), 
  i meant by `` you '' as federal goverment of germany not you as person :p, 
   personally i think you should be split between germany and russia : ^ ) and i personally think that ireland should be part of uk : ^  seriously though i do n't like at all the land you got from ww1 but those parts were majority polish such like polish corridor or posen region ... 
  i could understand that sentiment about germans land that were lost after second world war ( they had german majority and long history of having it , polish history in those areas was long too though . 
  ) , but lands lost by germany after first world war were taken from poland during it 's partitions 1772-1795 . 
  i very like germans/germany ( not in pis camp ) and consider them one of our most important allies but you kinda screwed us in 1939-1945 that 's one thing . 
  another is that , many nations that used to be big and strong in past , have such `` butt blasted '' syndrome ( hungarians , russains , poles and many others ) anyway , you do n't have to pay us reperations , only apologize for second world war and according to me we will be bff . 
  :p past is past . 
   we can go deeper deeper you say ? ... 
   lets get back to 1600 and make antirussian coaliton to stop spreading cancer into europe well , plc had some chance to conquer russia or at least more of it 's territories than it has took in otl, 
   also a country that to be honest has land it really should n't have . 
  ** so ... should poland be left with pre-war borders ( and with quite large minorities of ukrainians , belarussians ) or borders without so called recovered territories ( that were completely polish after expelling germans ) ** ( then eastern and eastern-northern germany and currently western poland ) ** and eastern borderlands ? / s ** ( then eastern poland , currently western ukraine western belarus , southern-eastern lithuania ) in second option , [ poland would look like that ] ( http://images61.fotosik.pl/1069/53d65cdff11ca23b.png ) so we would get not only screwed by having millions of killed citizens , ruined cities , our territory would get smaller , and being under infulence of ussr even if we were in winning coaltion, 
   just as they refused soviet access resulting in the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  are you serious there ? 
  why should poland give access to one of it 's enemies ? 
  :p  acting like a vulture with regards to czechoslovakia . 
  well we were assholes ( we should aid czechoslovakia in their fight with nazi germany and maybe there would be some hope ) , but czechs were assholes too when we were in war with soviets for our survival they backstabbed us and took zaolzie ( and if we failed we would end like czechoslovakia in 1938 ) . 
  poland and czechoslovakia did n't loved each other ( we were rivals in our competition for being leader our part of europe and being main ally of france ) in interwar period . 
  tbh , in our case it 's whole voivodeship , in case of romania it 's probably their capital , if instead of masovia voivodeship there was warsaw result would be much different p, 
  i know this , crown of poland was inhabited by germans , jews , and big share of population were southern ruthenians ( today ukrainians ), 
  in total years , for example vilnius regions belonged to poland for about 18 years because it was part of poland during 1921-1939 period . 
  3th may constitution was n't implemented unlucky for us . 
  also [ reciprocal guarantee of two nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reciprocal_guarantee_of_two_nations ) made de jure unitary country , de facto something more like federation . 
   but then we could run into some turboslavic/lechita loonies . 
  plz , no !, 
   lithuanian grand dukes was n't this more vytautas thing ? 
  that 's true that he was very pro-polish ( especially if compared to other politcans of us and/or uk ) but that 's another thing . 
   our commonwealth started from lithuanian kings dukes , not kings my friend !, 
  also , technically we could say that vasa dynasty was continuation of jagiellons . 
   time to return czechia ( with silesia ) ~ ~ silesia ~ ~ to ~ ~ germany ~ ~ ~ ~ austria ~ ~ ~ ~ czechia ~ ~ poland just like when boles\u0142aw chrobry did it . 
  fixed it for you . 
   triple the size it is today ? 
  pretty much this . 
  it shows how long those lands were part of poland , not size of it :p, 
  [ reaction of stalin to polish-lithuanian conflict ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/016/217/cdoygodmqgjqwknbo4fagffucuy3lchs.jpeg ), 
   stalin roosevelt and ~ ~ churchill ~ ~ took great part too in that . 
   you stole our poles . 
  we borrowed them !, 
  for eternity ... 
  i loved p\u0105czki with cream , jam was fine but cream was much better . 
   p\u0105czki ( / \u02c8p\u0254\u02d0nt\u0283ki / pawnch-kee , polish : p\u0105czki [ \u02c8p\u0254nt\u0361\u0282k\u02b2i ] singular : p\u0105czek ; old polish and silesian : krepel ) are pastries traditional to polish cuisine . 
  they are similar to doughnuts . 
  ***  p\u0105czki are deep-fried pieces of dough shaped into flattened spheres and filled with confiture or other sweet filling . 
  p\u0105czki are usually covered with powdered sugar , icing , glaze or bits of dried orange zest . 
  a small amount of grain alcohol ( traditionally , spiritus ) is added to the dough before cooking ; as it evaporates , it prevents the absorption of oil deep into the dough . 
  the common opinion is that the ideal p\u0105czek is fluffy and at the same time a bit collapsed , with a bright stripe around -- it is supposed to guarantee that the dough was fried in fresh oil . 
   although they look like german berliners , north american bismarcks or jelly doughnuts , p\u0105czki are made from especially rich dough containing eggs , fats , sugar , yeast and sometimes milk . 
  they feature a variety of fruit and creme fillings and can be glazed , or covered with granulated or powdered sugar . 
  powidl ( stewed plum jam ) and wild rose hip jam are traditional fillings , but many others are used as well , including strawberry , bavarian cream , blueberry , custard , raspberry , and apple . 
   p\u0105czki have been known in poland at least since the middle ages . 
  j\u0119drzej kitowicz has described that during the reign of august iii , under the influence of french cooks who came to poland , p\u0105czki dough was improved , so that p\u0105czki became lighter , spongier , and more resilient . 
  boles\u0142aw chrobry conquered moravia and slovakia in 1003 and those lands were lost ( bohemia got back moravia and hungary slovakia ) in 20 's -30 's of 11th century, 
  i checked english wiki and i found this  - ** 20 april 1585 : ** sold by denmark to poland-lithuania . 
   - ** 17 june 1585 ** : informal subdivisions established : pilten ( administered by pledges to 1660 ) , dondangen ( polish `` throne fief '' to 1795 ) and amboten ( polish `` throne fief '' to 16 . . ) . 
   - ** 28 october 1611 : ** incorporation into poland-lithuania as the district of pilten ( german : kreis pilten , polish : powiat piltynski ) as part of polish livonia declared ( not effected ) . 
   - ** 9 may 1617 : ** bishopric of pilten ( stift pilten ) in personal ( actually subordinated ) union with poland-lithuania .
