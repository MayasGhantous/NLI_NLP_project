   - ** 1656 : ** the rights of pledge bought by the duke of courland . 
   - ** 3 may 1660 : ** fief of poland-lithuanian to the duke of courland . 
   - ** 25 february 1661 : ** formal personal union with courland . 
   - ** 1701 - 1709 : ** occupied by sweden ( 1705 - 1706 interrupted by russian occupation ) . 
   - ** 1717 : ** personal union with the commonwealth restored . 
   - ** 28 march 1795 : ** pilten landtag approves annexation to russia , suzerainty of poland-lithuania declared void . 
  livonia was shared domain of gdl and crown of poland , so it 's probably not treated as part of crown of poland ( gdl had same rights to it ) . 
  according to polish wiki those parts were `` autonomic '' part of polish-lithuanian union , so it had probably similar status to livonia, 
  you mean duchy of courland and livonia ? 
  if yes then probably courland as fief probably would n't be counted ( just like duchy of prussia ) livonia was if i 'm correct shared domain of gdl and crownof poland so it was probably not treated as part of crown of poland ( not sure though ) . 
  that 's not mine map :p i 'm terrible bad at making maps . 
  date of start of poland ? 
  you mean spi\u0161 ? 
  it 's probably one of parts that have border with slovakia ( but if i 'm correct it belonged to poland longer than 330 years , . 
  i 'm not sure about that . ), 
  about territory reaching memel river , there is possibility that author of map didnt ' included congress poland ( partitions , and blah blah lack of freedom ) into time being of poland, 
  map of territories that belonged to polish states ( only crown of poland part in case of plc ), 
  it 's just some interesting `` data '' :d nothing more, 
  kazimierz wielki ( aka casimir iii the great ) had thing with jews if i remember correctly . 
  do n't start this topic !, 
  it will start shitstorm :p imho he was ethnic german that was loyal subject of polish crown and he considered himself ( since its ' 16th century ) most probably as prussian ( `` damn multiculti '' ) or maybe some renaissance scholar . 
   so merkel going against russia ( except when it touches on the gas supply to germany ) is a good thing in poles ' eyes . 
  hard to say ( everyone have their reason :p ) , because some/plenty `` poles '' that support for example pis or kukiz , think that germany is pro-russian . 
  parties that probably support/have positive attitiude merkel are po+psl+n owoczesna + other parties ( from centre-right to left and probably far-left ) vs parties that probably doese n't / have negative attitiude and those are pis + kukiz + other right wingers ( from right to far-right ) biggest support is probably from po and psl supporters ( part of epp ) centre-right parties . 
  for pis , merkel is better choice than schultz ( they hate this guy ) , but still she is zzis german whom they distrust . 
  but , that 's only my opinion, 
  there 's plenty reasons why some vote for pis 1 : social benefits like 500 + ( pis often speek that `` po '' will take 500 + from them ) 2 : they dislike po more , so they vote on pis as lesser evil since it 's biggest party that is n't po 3 : religious , conservative reasons ( pis have support of big part of catholic church ) 4 : migration crisis make pis stronger because of their strong opposition to accept migrants/refugees 5 : because they are `` patriotic '' party , so plenty people vote on pis because , muh sovereignty , traitors etc. 
  6 : they wanted `` change '' there are plenty reasons too why people support / vote on pis , but i 'm not supporter of pis . 
  probably [ this ] ( http://www.my-europe.org/articles/charles-de-gaulle/ )  on other aspects of the european construction , de gaulle appeared less enthusiastic than for the common market . 
  in fact , he was completely opposed to any kind of european federalism : in 1961 , he proposed the fouchet plan , which introduced the idea of cooperation between governments with absolutely no loss of sovereignty and no supranational institutions . 
  actually , de gaulle was opposed to any kind of loss of sovereignty for france . 
  he wanted it to be one of the great powers , and for that , independence was essential . 
  ** this is why he advertised his conception of a `` europe of nations '' , in which national governments would closely negotiate , but would never be forced to anything . 
  in order to protect this vision of europe , he caused the `` empty chair '' crisis in 1965 . 
  by refusing to attend any european meeting during six months , he forced his partners to give up qualified majority voting , which was to be implemented at the beginning of 1966 . 
  in doing so , he tilted the scale of the european construction in favor of unionism , as opposed to federalism ** . 
  * moreover , he damaged the reputation of european institutions by showing national governments how they could be ignored or blocked . 
  actually goverment does n't have 42 % support in society , according to pew research center survey pis ( pis + it 's two coalition partners have ) 38 % support ( and it 's positive attitiude so it includes people who will vote on differnet parties ) and in recent surveys in poland ( excluding cbos that gave pis more than 40 % of supports , since it belongs to gov it always give rulling party bigger support that it has . ), 
  it had about 33-34 % of support ( po+n . 
  have similar support ) so pis most likely in 2019 will loss elections to opposition ( po + it 's others ) or will rule with kukiz15 as as coalition ( it 's still lost , because currently they have rule as single party ) or rule as minority gov ( they would have to gain support of other parties and that would be change from stable , single party rule ) and probably only kukiz15 would support pis . 
  we still have plenty time , po in early 2015 ( year of elections ) had biggest support , plenty things can happen and change attitiude of people to parties . 
  '' ** edit : pis also have single-rule because parties like razem , korwin , united left did n't make through 5 % ( or 8 % in case of coalition ) threshold and those votes went to pis and gave them power ( they had about 38 % of votes ) , po had more percent of votes in 2007 ( about 40 % ) but it could n't form goverment without partner ** . 
   so why only import 1.2 bcm per year via the terminal if you could cut russian imports by 75 % ? 
  because lng imports are more expensive than russian gas ? 
  it will take some time to import more gas . 
  we want to create baltic pipe with [ denmark ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/7,155287,21922290,coraz-blizej-gazociagu-z-norwegii-przez-danie-do-polski-rywal.html?disableredirects=true ) and recently we had first transfer of [ american gas ] ( http://gospodarka.dziennik.pl/news/artykuly/551707,gazowiec-lng-gaz-swinoujscie-statek-z-amerykanskim-gazem-dostawa-gazu-z-usa.html ) *** by google translator  ** by october 2022 , gas from norway could be flown to poland by a new baltic pipe merger - announced the gas pipeline managers of poland and denmark . 
  and the government has adopted a secret statement on the russian pipeline nord stream 2 . 
  **  if by july 25 they receive sufficiently large bids , `` transmission system operators will proceed with the implementation of the baltic pipe project as part of the rapid project path to start the gas transmission service from 1 october 2022 , '' gaz-system and energinet.dk reported . 
   ** published on tuesday the documents contain the conclusions about the baltic pipe plans . 
  new pipelines will be able to send 10 billion cubic meters to poland from norway . 
  gas per year ** . 
  *** second article about american gas  such days as today are going to history , because the first transport of gas from the us to poland will in future be sure to be recorded in history textbooks , said prime minister beata szydlo . 
  i found some [ source from 2016 ] ( http://atlanticsentinel.com/2016/10/countries-most-critical-of-russia-sanctions-least-affected/ ) germany is not neither least or most affected country , still it belong to countries most affected ( above of eu average ) [ how have sanctions impacted russian/eu trade ? 
  ] ( http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/relations-publiques/news-at-the-institute/news-archives.html/_/news/corporate/2016/how-have-sanctions-impacted-russ ) germany = 3,3 % ( it 's above of eu average but smaller than eastern eu countries like poland or baltic states while higher than romania ) [ raport ] ( http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/sites/internationalgovernance/shared/the%20new%20deterrent%20international%20sanctions%20against%20russia%20over%20the%20ukraine%20crisis%20-%20impacts,%20costs%20and%20further%20action.pdf )  ** eastern europeans toughen it out **  by contrast , central and eastern european countries that used to be dominated by russia have seen huge decreases in their trade . 
   the baltic states , which border russia , saw their exports fall between 9.1 and 12.7 percent . 
  finland experienced a 7.1-percent decline . 
  the czech republic , poland and slovakia reported similar losses . 
   `` this has been precipitated by moscow 's retaliatory countermeasures on eu food imports , the drop in the global oil price and russia 's subsequent recession , '' according to moret . 
   unlike the greeks and the italians , who , polls suggest , have considerable sympathy for russia and putin , eastern europeans have experienced russian rule firsthand and are willing to suffer the consequences of safeguarding against further russian encroachment on the region . 
   the lng terminal in poland well according to wikipedia  ** the terminal 's initial regasification capacity is 5 billion cubic metres per annum ( 180 billion cubic feet per annum ) , and with the construction of the third tank its capacity is due to expand to reach 7.5 billion cubic metres per annum ( 260 billion cubic feet per annum ) satisfying approximately 50 % of poland 's annual gas demand ** . 
  the total cost of the terminal is $ 950 million ( pln 3.5 billion ) . 
  [ 1 ] the first lng delivery to the terminal is expected on 11 december 2015 so i think it 's major source in our cause ( or maybe even main )  the main purpose for the terminals was simple - price ceiling . 
  i do n't know how it was in poland , that was one of reasons to build lng , we had one of highest prices of gas in europe . 
  lies !, 
  if you would be that powerful , you would be rulers of world !, 
  pics or did n't happen !, 
  ah , you silly americans !, 
   nope , lithuania is already buying lng and we 're seeking to build our own lng terminal . 
  furthermore , we 're building gas links to finland and poland . 
  we have lng terminal too , in \u015awinouj\u015bcie also we 're ( or we 're going to be ) part of baltic pipe and lithuanian -- polish pipeline, 
  according to this , in one day americans slaughtered much more people than nazis ( and we can add people killed by japanese ) during entire iiww keximus maximus yeah , right ... 
   at that point , might as well rename it byzantium . 
  close enough . 
  in that case , they could name themself as roman empire and claim italy and other regions :p, 
  also masovia was only fief in 1500 ( it become part of poland only in 1526 ), 
  yeah we know him as well . 
  `` wieszatiel '' f ** k him !, 
   it 's all your fault !, 
  you stopped lithuania from becoming kingdom , which made muscovites stronger lallala i/we cant `` t hear you !!, 
   you create prussia !, 
  we know that !, 
  you don `` t have to yell at us !, 
   you saved austria !, 
  we were partners in crime !!, 
  you are to blame too !, 
  reeeeee !, 
  shots were fired ... we will have our revenge mrs le pen !, 
   maps that show 1795-1918 period also triggers me friend . 
  we can relate . 
  we know that feel bro ... ** triggered ** damn muscovites , prussians and austrians !, 
  probably from latin aquisgranum ( most probably that one ) or aquae grani, 
   unfortunately it took a little while to realize that equality included black people but to our credit we did that and we fought a bloody war , the bloodiest war that has ever been fought on the american continent , for the right of black people to be free like everybody else you sure about that ? 
   the american civil war was fought in the united states from 1861 to 1865 . 
  after a long standing controversy ** over slavery and state 's rights ** , war broke out in april 1861 , when confederates attacked fort sumter in south carolina , shortly after abraham lincoln was elected . 
  the nationalists of the union proclaimed loyalty to the u.s. constitution . 
  they faced secessionists of the confederate states of america advocating states ' rights to perpetual slavery and its expansion in the americas . 
   in america women can vote , they can even run for president !, 
  in europe too , and you know what ? 
  for example lithuania even has women as president , before us . 
  and also many prime ministers in europe .
