you know what ? 
  rosetta makes me feel so giddy-sciency in my tummy that i 'm not even in the mood for politician-bashing . 
  [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/38s5xzy.jpg ) is polish military graveyard . 
  look closely and you can see red-white bands on the crosses . 
  how the culture is infused is n't relevant . 
  if peer-pressured people will celebrate halloween and propagate it forward , there 's no difference . 
  til you have to be in eu to be a `` major european country '' . 
  it 's the typical `` lie detector '' machine . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polygraph#validity  polygraphy is widely criticized . 
  despite claims of 90 % validity by polygraph advocates , the national research council has found no evidence of effectiveness . 
   [ ... ]  in 2003 , the national academy of sciences ( nas ) issued a report entitled `` the polygraph and lie detection '' . 
  the nas found that the majority of polygraph research was `` unreliable , unscientific and biased '' , concluding that 57 of the approximately 80 research studies that the american polygraph association relies on to come to their conclusions were significantly flawed . 
   [ ... ]  the nas concluded that the polygraph '' ... may have some utility '' but that there is `` little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy . '', 
  you believe that this point  establish mandatory policy for polygraph testing of government employees and candidates for elective office regarding their involvement in corruption , cooperation with foreign intelligence services and having dual citizenship . 
  involving a faulty technology , that never should have any place in official proceedings , sounds good ? 
  yeah . 
  it 's the other way around . 
  being buddies makes them trade . 
  not really . 
  it would be a `` no true scotsman '' if he said something like `` you ca n't call yourself a football fan if you 're a nationalistic moron '' or `` real football players are not like that '' or `` poles are not like that '' . 
  all he said is that you ca n't put all football fans into one bag , which is true . 
  and that most poles disapprove of such behaviour , which is also true . 
  you have no idea how that fallacy works , do you ? 
  not us , only immigrants . 
  why would you stay in poland when there 's germany next door ? 
  surely not if most dutch have that attitude . 
  it 's not really good if people 's looks annoy you . 
  no matter who they are . 
  it 's not like a locals had anything to say about russian or prussian/german laws . 
  saying that it was `` illegal in poland '' during the occupations is same kind of mistake as `` polish death camps '' . 
  dat feel when we are the only country in europe that never penalized homosexuality , and now we trail behind . 
  the prussian-russian partition split is common in polish statistics , but christianity is spread surprisingly evenly . 
  declared faith at around 90 % , church attendance at around 40 % . 
  * 28 injured , 1 missing after methane explosion in mys\u0142owice-weso\u0142a coal mine . 
  there are issues with rescue operation to find the last person missing - methane levels are still high enough to cause a second explosion and a special wall is being erected to help with dropping down gas levels to threshold allowing for the operation .

  rotterdam supplies both rhine and blue banana . 
  to some extend it supplies the whole continent . 
  actually , it 's probably both . 
  not germany , only it 's a main port of continental [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ), 
  to be honest , there are many people in our country still butthurt over our lost empire that has been gone for 300 years . 
  it 's made by american cdc , and from `` traveller 's health '' on their website it seems that they base it on standards and laws , with some research added in . 
  first - remember that there 's a difference between what you get in cities and in rural areas . 
  european city water is probably universally safe , since any modern water-processing plant pushes out water of higher quality than any bottled stuff . 
  but it changes outside of towns . 
  and if local law does n't force the quality there , there 's no sure way to tell if its safe . 
  it does n't mean that water in any of the grey countries will harm you , it only means that there 's no guarantee of safety . 
  and from all the news involving it , i always get the feeling that cdc is really sensitive and careful . 
  we can get behind repeat of 01.09 , just without 17.09 . 
  guys . 
  stop for a second . 
  i understand your position , russia , and if we have to , we can do the cold war thingy . 
  you 'll pout and invade countries , we will support them . 
  and like ... support them for realises , just like 50 years ago . 
  proxy wars , true embargoes , blockades , harsh politics , creating coups and revolutions - full service . 
  but can we please drop the nuclear weapon part ? 
  srsly , it 's not fun at all . 
  nobody likes it . 
  just stop . 
  i live in our capital , so i might be biased , but ones i see most often : * arrogant * self-absorbed * bad road manners - aggressive drivers , annoying cyclists , careless pedestrians * hipsters, 
  that 's the side-joke . 
  the smirnoff-absolut tunnel, 
  it 's not about rmb getting stronger , only change in currency reserves and currencies used for trade . 
  this move is a sign of a larger process of global economies leaving dollar for alternative currencies for both of these . 
  we currently use only one american-made drone . 
  rest are either israeli or locally made . 
  estonia will take every offer of being considered northern europe . 
  you do n't know how recessive genes work , do n't you ? 
   hola is a vpn proxy service that provides a faster and more open internet . 
  how small your / s needs to be to get blacklisted anyway ? 
  short-term ? 
  definitely no . 
  long-term ? 
  definitely yes . 
  having russian agents around is never good for your eu-oriented country . 
  30 % `` yes '' , 70 % `` what the hell is belarus ? '', 
  where i live you do n't need a judge and only a local government green light . 
  and how 's pride parade not a demonstration ? 
  it 's a march for lgbt rights . 
  i think it 's one guy , only in two masks . 
  goddamn you 're hilariously uneducated . 
  have you ever seen any demonstration/protest not in public space ? 
  most governments ensure right of citizens to make manifestations and protests as one of the basic rights in the constitution . 
  particular laws differ a bit between countries , but most of the time if you notify the local government of your protest/parade/whatever and prove that you 're well prepared to handle it - they are legally obliged to provide you with public space and police protection . 
  what ? 
  while pride parades often have governmental/city support in a form of encouragements , they are practically always funded by non-governmental organizations from donations . 
  please get your facts right to avoid spewing idiocy . 
  sure , good dub is better than a voice over , but how many good dubs are out there ? 
  mostly for lower-tier films and tv shows . 
  i 've heard some attempts at cheap polish and german dubs and outcomes are horrid . 
  most cable tvs here in poland have an option to switch to subtitles when watching films . 
  but i want to watch glory of `` uncle boonmee who can recall his past lives '' without learning thai for 10 years . 
  i 'd still pick a voice-over over a dub . 
  b-b-but i 'm a connoisseur of drunk brits ; - ;, 
  before you start talking about accuracy - it 's from a project called atlas of prejudice . 
  it 's supposed to be extremely stereotypical and based on common thought and not facts . 
  til europe = world .
