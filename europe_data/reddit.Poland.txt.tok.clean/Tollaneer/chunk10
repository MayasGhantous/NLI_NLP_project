  and on this chart - people committing one of the worst crimes of healthy life that is self-diagnosis , in arbitrary units ( so is having a cold 50 % or just 30 % healthy ? ) . 
  yeah , i 'm gon na pass that one . 
  holy shit i want my government to admit what previous one have done ( current one is not connected in any way to this happening ) , take the punishment from court of human rights , pay millions dollars to families of terrorists who were kept in poland ( since they 'll probably end up on death row ) , and close the damn thing . 
  i love these threads since that one day when i spent 2 hours to learn all the states . 
  polan can into add-ons . 
  still not the same groups . 
  there 's a difference between law and justice supporters and even fanatics ( that are pretty common even in groups of intelligent middle-age people with good income ) , who believe in conspiracies , and nationalistic extremists who burn art and are basically packs of roaming hooligans . 
  damn this thing is wrong on so many levels . 
  angry , uneducated guys in their 20-30 with nationalist ideas in heads are not really related to ones that believe in conspiracy theories about the plane crash . 
  or at least - their anger is not rooted in treatment of that event . 
  it 's more of a `` we 're poor , jobless and the world is faster than us '' which leads them to nationalism and hate of people making country around them speed away . 
  major groups focusing on conspiracies have cut themselves off from this years protests . 
  also - it 's still a marginal issue . 
  just because all the idiots and brutes of the country found a holiday to meet and fuck things up does n't mean that nationalism is growing , only that it 's now focused on one point . 
  political organisation that grew out of these movements has a laughable position and nobody even mentions them if it 's not about the independence day marches . 
  also - downvoting americans no matter what they say is really out of hand . 
  what a sad creature you are . 
  [ actually it 's even worse in germany ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/europe_sunshine_hours_map.png ), 
  it 's a better empire that gives you a more democratic nation , bigger autonomy and more freedom . 
  are eurosceptics not capable of making any reasonable arguments without repeating same stuff for the last decade ? 
  it gets a bit annoying you know . 
  holy shit i fucking hate when people spew that bullshit . 
  it 's easy to say that crap while being usa , or uk , or france , or germany . 
  but there 's no chance for smaller countries to be independent , ok ? 
  it 's always going to be influence of russia , us , germany , france , china , japan or whoever from the economical elite decides that they want this country . 
  so it 's not a choice between `` influence '' and `` independence '' . 
  there is no `` independence '' option . 
  it 's not there . 
  nothing . 
  null . 
  it 's good if we have a choice by whom we will be economically ruled . 
  and as a citizen of a country that made the switch years ago - yes . 
  us/eu supervision is amazing and absolutely brilliant compared to being under boot of russia . 
  i 'm glad my country sucks dicks of western countries . 
  but ... you just ... eh ... 
  `` today carlos told me we 're technically in ireland ... weird . 
  welcome ... to night vale . 
  [ theme plays ] '', 
  not much , these houses look cheap . 
  and they just created a new adult low-wage public worker . 
  humans are not cheap and take years to grow , so if you would create a careful analysis you could even come to conclusion that this created hidden income . 
  ok , i think that 's a final version :  ** colonel thomas pappas ** was relieved of his command on may 13 , 2005 , after receiving non-judicial punishment on may 9 , 2005 , for two instances of dereliction , including that of allowing dogs to be present during interrogations .

  see ? 
  not in the eu . 
  actually , russia has the biggest heroin problem in the world , so that syringe there is really funny . 
  go with europe , ukraine . 
  just look at these daaaayum legs on that devil . 
  different standards for different situations . 
  with syria and egypt , eu is looking for oil sources and market of developing countries . 
  lebanon is a key country for ship transport industry so it 's crucial to put your influence there . 
  ukraine on the other hand is not that economically important . 
  and your biggest perks - huge population of customers and cheap labour for standards of western europe is already available to the west . 
  but at the same time ukraine is insanely important politically . 
  it 's a key battleground of eu-russia competition , so eu is trying to shoot down russian influence in ukraine . 
  if it drops low enough , union is going to break the bank anyway . 
  when you have bands like bracia figo fagot that are parodies of the genre , it 's pretty clear that there 's an audience of disco polo that listens to it ironically . 
  it 's a shame we do n't have polls checking how many people associate themselves with the church as often as political ones . 
  last month has been such a clusterfuck of insane amounts of unacceptable shit flowing out of the church , and whole nation just cringing at the sight . 
  because this thing that op posted is not the only atrocious statement from a priest in recent weeks . 
  pretty much every few days one of them has a `` slip of a tongue '' that was `` misunderstood '' ( seriously , i heard this explanation for like 3 statements already ) . 
  this is going to bite church attendance so hard in the ass . 
  this could be a breaking point - there are more and more people who still believe in god but turn away to protestant churches , or even still practice their beliefs in a `` catholic '' way but without attending mass. 
  but last month was just a condensed parade of our catholic church yelling `` we 're mental '' , so it 's just going to speed the process . 
  important thing to understand - disco polo ( cheezy polish copy of italodisco from 90s ) , while still somehow seriously enjoyed on the countryside , is also listened by folk in cities ironically , as a form of pastiche . 
  there are even disco polo bands that are intentionally shitty to cater to that type of viewers .
