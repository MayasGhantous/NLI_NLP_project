  of course not . 
  this is when the rapid boom of development will slow down to pace of other developed european countries . 
  last decade in poland was pretty much fighting for this `` bump '' to launch us as high as possible , so when funds are gone we come out as close to the west as we can , and then start handling transformation into usual western layout . 
  wages will get there in time . 
   muslim immigration -  rising antisemitism ftfy . 
  * '' < =  '' * means * `` if and only if '' * , which is obviously wrong here . 
  there are many reasons for antisemitism . 
  implication ( symbolised by * '' -  '' * ) is more appropriate . 
  obviously . 
  we joined esa to somehow transfer half of its budget to our program . 
  this is how we roll nowadays . 
  so the answer to `` how poland came to be a major eu power '' is `` they started fucking over other countries instead of being fucked over '' . 
  pro-american feelings in poland are burning fast . 
  maybe if we finally get visas in a year or so and building of an american missile base wo n't be a pr catastrophe - maybe they 'll be back . 
  other than that - due to rising economic bonds we 're more and more friendly with germany . 
  edit : typo, 
  i hope these go back to descendants of respective owners/organizations they belonged to . 
  proof of poe 's law . 
  i hope . 
  eurovision has always been full of `` clowns '' , only difference is in that now the clowns are breaking rules of decency of your generation and not the previous ones . 
  well , the tilt in the photo is a bit annoying . 
  but spot is definitely lovely . 
  i mean - i 'm all for modern and fresh , but post-industrial certainly has its charm . 
  there 's something special in metal , rust and bricks . 
  it 's almost beautiful in how efficiency-centred and unapologetic it is . 
  photo or the place ? 
  krakow is pretty meaningless as a transportation hub . 
  it might provide a lot of traffic , but it 's not really a place where many routes in different directions cross . 
  but lack of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a indeed is weird . 
  but it 's like one of the most important circlejerks , even outside of reddit . 
  they ca n't just come up with a pretty ok browser and just take it away from us !, 
  lets see what crazy way to power he 'll find this time !, 
  * `` berlusconi ... finds a way * '' - jeff goldblum, 
  lets admit it - miracle of polish rise in the last decade was made possible by billions ( can i use word `` milliards '' on / r/europe ? ), 
  of euros that eu bathes us in . 
  we 're basically getting `` late '' marshall plan aid , only it 's for both ww2 and communism . 
  poland is on a way that in a good case scenario will set us up as a mid-tier european economy , but after 2020 when money hose dries up ( current predictions say that 2014-2020 budget is the last one where poland is weak enough to receive money instead of giving it ) the whole train is going to slow down . 
  do n't forget russia-netherlands-relations-ruining tulips . 
  solution - bike hockey . 
  i should be a diplomat . 
  it did n't mean to make it sound like all communism-leaning people have outbursts of silly like the guy before , so i 'm sorry if you took it like that . 
  but it is quite sad and `` you-don ` t-know-shit '' kind of feeling when you see people totally bash capitalism and glorify communism when every day of your life you live next to effects of both . 
  i mean - capitalism is not even remotely close to being perfect . 
  it hurts many people , it leads to disgusting things happening . 
  but trial just shows that it is a lesser evil . 
  man , i love when communists try to make their system look good in the eyes of people who lived in it . 
  it 's like watching a kitten . 
  they * freed * poland from nazis , but they were n't fighting for * freedom * of poland . 
  these are two totally different things . 
  sounds nice . 
  i do n't use fast food as food , i use it as drugs . 
  do n't worry , not counting food that slowly kills me , i also love american-style pancakes and apple pie . 
  with burger king settling few years ago , only fast food left that i wish we had here is taco bell . 
  damn this stuff sounds so delicious . 
  in a kfc kind of way . 
  brilliant and makes you feel like a dirty pig . 
  because satire . 
  well , it [ worked in poland ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_grodzka ) , despite us being on average a very conservative country ( and still pretty trans - and homophobic ) . 
  i guess it 's a rule of counter reaction . 
  in countries that are deep in conservative beliefs , the liberal side is much stronger and more active `` per capita '' . 
   human error remains the most important factor conclusion - we need robots !, 
  breaking news : russian scientists found traces of / u/jeffvangundy in the lake vostok . 
  well , it 's not really feeling `` high and mighty '' , it 's more of a feeling `` above the absolute bottom '', 
  you can learn about existence of maersk by going into any cargo hub in the world . 
  i do n't think there 's any other company 's containers i 've seen more of than theirs . 
  and clergy is still appalled and wondering why people in this country turn away from the church at such rate ... 
  b-b-but my circlejerk, 
  it 's belarus , and not north korea . 
  you can still get a beer there , meet some people , talk with them openly , even about their internal politics . 
  there are parks , bars , theaters , cinemas with many , if not all , western movies . 
  it 's been like this behind iron curtain , so right now in belarus - it 's even more lenient . 
  slow turn of eastern and central europe towards the west and north in search for oil and natural gas has been harvesting its first crops for the last few years . 
  architecture of vienna is so amazing . 
  i love the old , but also respect the new so much . 
  it takes insane amounts of skill and finesse to look at and understand the nature of vienna 's historicism and play a modern song to the classic rhythm . 
  you guys have an electoral threshold ? 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/albedo-e_hg.svg dark soil and trees can produce albedo similar to the sea . 
  combined with less interference from the atmosphere because of height , it makes stars more visible there . 
  it 's how it actually works . 
  the visibility of stars depends only on light `` noise '' . 
  it 's silly i have to remind you , but all the stars of the night sky are still there even during the day , only sun interference is so hard we ca n't see them . 
  the same happens in cities . 
  all the thousands of stars are on the sky , only interference from the bright of the city , combined with our eyes not being dark adapted to fullest extend do n't register them all , but the light from them is still there . 
  and exactly the same happens on the sea . 
  i know it sounds a bit silly and `` self feeding '' , but confusion it 's caused by not understanding how this shit works . 
  visibility of stars depends only on amount of light around you . 
  on sea there 's more light , due to sea reflecting starlight . 
  it 's not actually making stars dimmer ( that 'd be silly to assume ) , it 's only creating problems with our perception of it . 
  visible spectrum is a bit shitty for stargazing , not to mention our eye not being remotely good tool for it . 
  oh , and just a bonus - the sea is on sea level , the higher you go , the more stars you see due to less atmospheric interference . 
  that 's the problem here . 
  western media is talking about us aiding `` rebels '' , as if they were unified group . 
  when this could n't be further from truth . 
  there are factions actually wishing to change syria into new jordan , under banners of moderate islamism and westernisation . 
  there is muslim brotherhood there . 
  there is al-qaeda and other extremists in there . 
  the issue is supporting the right people and making sure aid does n't get into wrong hands . 
  water is way more reflective than ground/rocks . 
  so it 's reflecting the light of stars themselves , creating sort of `` natural [ light pollution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/light_pollution ) '' strong enough to lower star visibility . 
  well , it is a bit of mistake on the translator side , but mostly it comes from the fact that wa\u0142\u0119sa has problems with his own language and creating coherent sentences .
