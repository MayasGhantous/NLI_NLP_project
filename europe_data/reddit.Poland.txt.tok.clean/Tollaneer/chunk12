  he 's been saying crazy shit even during his presidency and all the way in the 90s and 00s . 
  seriously though - why is it so diverse ? 
  are blue ones cities and red deep rural areas ? 
  it 's a simple guide to encourage people to further check programs of parties that had high scores with them . 
  also - it might help with learning about political leanings of european parliament parties . 
  most people know a lot about parties in their country , but could n't tell you what are differences in programs of epp and alde . 
  again ? 
  some do , mostly in rural areas . 
  but fine art of making moonshine is slowly dying . 
  cheep booze now pours from ukraine , and not our basements . 
  [ eurostat to the rescue ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/causes_of_death_statistics ), 
  i would agree , if not for the news about water leaking from flooded reactor into pacific , that pop up every few weeks for the last months , every time being second or third information . 
  well , it was originally funded by a polish guy , jeronimo martins just bought it later on . 
  who cares anyway ? 
  only thing that 's important is that they employ and pay taxes in here . 
  to some extend , i think it happens in every big city along the main rivers . 
  warsaw is 200km from baltic sea and sometimes you can hear seagulls in here , so i guess they just fly up the river and stay in cities since they are mounds of food for them . 
  i 'm so glad they will use it to launch james webb space telescope . 
  it would be really painful to see something happen to it , so it 's great they will use such a reliable piece of equipment . 
  the difference is pretty much only in symbolism . 
  dresden was a whole city where many people died . 
  that 's horrible , but dresden is not a monument . 
  concentration camp sites are monuments to themselves . 
  i 'm sorry , i thought it was a common knowledge , but fyi - ww2 was not in twelfth century , it ended 70 years ago . 
  actually , our motorways are not that bad . 
  it gets crazy in cities and on lower-grade roads , but highways are pretty ok . 
  recently on / r/spacex i 've seen some news about esa wanting to compete with rising commercial launch providers by developing cheaper version of ariane . 
  it 's on-hold . 
  they still need a lot of money to finish it , and they ca n't find investors that will put out enough funds . 
  one time i had a drunk norwegian in a pub awkwardly explain to me that him `` working with siemens '' is not as bad as it sounds . 
  oh my , for a second there i thought / r/europe merged with / int / . 
  ~ ~ i would gladly see the source of that information , have n't heard of it even once and something like this would rather appear in local news . 
  for now i 'm cautiously calling bullshit on this . ~ ~ edit : thanks for the source below, 
  we have `` sezon og\u00f3rkowy '' in poland which means `` cucumber season '' . 
  people who oppose it overlook major issue - in countries like poland , czech republic , and countries further east that want to go nuclear , we 're not talking about choosing between nuclear and solar/wind/geothermal , only about switching to atom or staying with coal-based energy production . 
  if greenpeace hates both combustion and nuclear power so much , i 'll gladly hear their alternatives that will find cheap source of clean energy to create these 150 terawatt hours that would be gone without coal in poland . 
  yes , waste is a big problem . 
  we get that . 
  and we will someday turn to solar , wind energy is already quickly growing source in here , but today we need more power for a developing country , and we do n't have money for clean energy . 
  there 's just no option `` we 're massively going clean right now '' in here . 
  it 's nuclear or more coal . 
  when can we expect the data to be put together into a fancy analysis ? 
  poland - i 'm layman , but from what i understand we have this institution called kir , founded by biggest banks and nbp ( national bank of poland ) , that created a system called elixir ( and a few others , that are used on special occasions like transfers above few million pln or expresselixir for immediate transfers ) , which is unified way the banks deal with transfers between each other . 
  nowadays normal transfers are usually free , or cost like 0,50 z\u0142 ( around 0,12 euro ) , and immediate transfers are around 2-4z\u0142 ( 0,5-1 euro ) . 
  yes , but there is at least one big difference here - france is not city-state with 5 million people . 
  i 'm not saying that it would n't work on large scale , since it has never been tried and i have no data , i 'm just having doubts since there are many systems and solutions that work with city-states and small countries , and fall apart on large scale . 
  with all my dislike for these groups , and belief in liberal society - i also believe that , having modern european virtues in head , an absolute freedom of speech is more important than attacking groups that stand in the way of tolerance and liberalization . 
  forcing them to disband or uphold their beliefs is only giving them political tools , but even more so - lowering ourselves to their aggressive game , that goes beyond debate . 
  history clearly shows that societies need time . 
  and people will eventually learn to tolerate others , but the way to do it is not slashing freedom of speech to quiet other political options and irritating the unstable political area . 
  it was always done , one way or another , through years or even decades of education . 
  [ it 's not that bad ] ( http://stwot.motortrend.com/files/2013/03/2014-volvo-v60-euro-spec-rear-three-quarter.jpg ), 
  modern wagons are pretty nice .

  ** poland ** * law and justice continues to lead in polls over ruling civic platform * civic platform itself is preparing for internal elections for the party leader , which will go down between current prime minister donald tusk and leader of conservative faction inside civic platform - jaros\u0142aw gowin * nothing really interesting happens, 
  `` no data '' presumably . 
  it took `` a few days '' literally once when data-collecting program broke down . 
  partial results are in pretty much always available day after the election . 
  and full results 1 or 2 days after that . 
   come on now , you think they 'll try our traffickers after that ice truck fiasco ? 
  sinking boats on mediterranean never stopped anyone . 
  they are running away from war and traffickers promised them cities of gold in sweden and germany . 
  and then to the moon filled with free cheese . 
  totally . 
  we farm with tanks and defend from nazis on horses . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  everything in polan is upside-down . 
  we 've been rused by filthy westerners once again !, 
   it means it ** probably ** would not be regulated so in ** most cases ** private contributions . 
  so , it 's not clear . 
  case closed . 
  this graph shows main issue of communism . 
  it 's a great idea in theory , and if all people in a country would immediately switch to being honest communist idealists it would work . 
  this is why first-generation kibbutzim could function with nontraditional ideas of ownership . 
  but in real , full-scale application communism always fails before it reaches the final form of `` real communism '' . 
  modern communists love to moan about how every example of real-life communism was n't `` real communism '' , while missing the fact that this is the core issue of the system . 
  communism is so bad , it always fails before it can stabilize and become functional - always morphing into a broken , totalitarian system under a veil of communism . 
  and in here it 's evident - first bloom of industrialization pushes countries forward along with capitalist nations , and then it slowly burns out , dying and morphing into something totally broken . 
  not to mention - economic inertia is also a big factor here . 
  effects of capitalist investment work for decades into communist rule , sitting behind nationalized factories , but after it fades away , this post - `` attempt at communism '' just tumbles . 
  to all young and naive xxi-century communists - this what happens when you attempt a switch to communism . 
  on the top of the riese project - walbrzych is simply a coal mining city . 
  it means that for a few centuries there was constant digging in every direction - there are hundreds of unsurveyed tunnels from that activity . 
  it 's not that bad - drinking water supply is apparently still in a safe zone , and city is using this occasion to clean up the riverbed . 
  it 's full of random stuff that accumulated throughout the centuries - there have been some interesting finds in a recent days , like well-preserved part of xix century water draining systems , some xix and xviii century masonry , and a ship that sunk during warsaw uprising . 
  yes , that makes it hard to compare warsaw with rest of the country , but you can compare it with other cities - warsaw gdp per capita is in the same range as wien and stockholm , other cities that are financial and corporate centers of their respective countries . 
  how are they annoying ? 
  things burn . 
  burning things expand . 
  expanding things make sounds . 
  there were no gunshots . 
  wars are triggered by certain people , but reasoning behind these wars is created by complex relationships of millions of people throughout hundreds of years . 
  and that side it can be said that wars `` just happen '' . 
  it 's too complex to ever predict or pinpoint the trigger . 
  just because it rose in total , does n't mean that there ca n't be a crisis in a certain area . 
  i think two sides of the uprising argument can co-exist and be true at the same time . 
  i mean - warsaw uprising was largely naive and useless . 
  ** if we look from a cold , mathematical , tactical standpoint ** - it is simply a historical fact that it was a failure and a mistake that left city in ruins . 
  but this does n't change that on a higher , symbollic level it was a beautiful and heroic event , show of incredible human loyalty and belief in high values . 
  and because of that ** from a humanistic , emotional standpoint ** it had a point and was needed .
