  i like how every tiny bit of criticism or satire toward us is always `` anti-americanism '' . 
  argentina and chile - forever together . 
  as a girlie man - yay for volunteer military !, 
  yeah . 
  and tusk gambled his position for eu denying sikorski 's candidature . 
  it was either sikorski or tusk going in , and they chose tusk . 
  and he 's doing one of the most responsible jobs in the country . 
  with any other job ( surgeon , fireman , nurse ) you would say that responsibility should mean bigger wages , so please apply same logic to politicians . 
  they 're not monsters , they 're people too . 
  he did a major gamble using sikorski . 
  he knew what he was doing . 
  also - heart of darkness happened to belgians . 
  reddit has way more distinctive and unique behaviours and customs than isis . 
  they do n't have distinctive art , customs , language , behaviours , etc. . not every seperate group is a separate culture . 
   `` they 're also two of the only genocides that you are actually legally forbiden from denying in several european countries '' not true . 
  polish law forbids denying `` nazi crimes , communist crimes , other crimes against peace , humanity and war crimes . '' . 
  just switch it to genocide denial as a whole and keep it at that . 
  also - holocaust and armenia are not only well-documented genocides . 
  rwanda , cambodia , burundi are all documented fairly well , and nobody sane denies that they happened . 
  only real place that could cause some problems would be consideration of holodomor as genocide . 
  isis is not a race or a culture , it 's a group within a certain cultural sphere . 
  i mean ... they are russian after all . 
  ww1 was before technology made `` massive amounts of inexperienced troops '' war senseless . 
  those italians might have integrated into british-dominated society , but they wo n't self-identify with british ancestry , because they do n't have one . 
  they will soak up british culture , but they wo n't self-identify with it . 
  their britishness started in america . 
  this is what i meant by common history ending in xviii century . 
  any connection americans have between one another and to the land they live on , starts in 1700s . 
  same connections in europe are at least 1000 years old , with some countries extending to hundreds of years before christ . 
  in europe , whole right-wing , `` nationalistic '' block is settled on ideas like `` we 're ethnically united '' or `` we have been here since 5th century '' . 
  none of these work in usa . 
  and , going back to my original point , because of that your right-wing politicians use jingoism more than their european counterparts . 
  yeah . 
  the us totally consists of only people who identify with british ancestry . 
  ** common ** history of people in your country end in xviii century . 
  you do realize that this is n't going to happen in any nearest future , right ? 
  usa is lacking basic foundations that most of the countries stand on , like centuries of universal ethnicity/religion/history , that bind people together . 
  jingoism is one of the only things your politicians can hold on to and refer to when leading political campaigns . 
  actually , according to raw data , road deaths in lithuania increased by 4 % between 2013 and 2014 . http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-4656_en.htm, 
  good thing no generations before you though that way , or you would n't have these `` beautiful historical centres '' . 
  not really . 
  [ milan cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milan_cathedral ) was started in 1386 and opened in 1965 . 
  sagrada familia with its 150 years and unchanged project is a quickie . 
  friendly advice - do n't get into conversation about definition of `` a building '' . 
  it one of these insolvable , bullshit internet wars that will be going for eternity . 
  please do n't call these documentaries . 
  it 's an insult to bbc-tier stuff , and even more so to directors who shape their documentaries into art . 
  if eiffel tower counts , then this is the true op construction : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_radio_mast and hundreds of other tall constructions that are not really buildings . 
  sacking someone because he was conscripted is highly illegal . 
  plz gib greek ads to make the split even better . 
  classic move from economy falling apart . 
  stealing from people with forced currency exchange happened many times before . 
  i wo n't quote because you pretty much leaned everything on time frame argument , since you clearly do n't have anything else to say . 
  and time frame had to be there since comparing anything that communism did to , for example , renaissance `` capitalism '' is absurd . 
  ok , let 's do this . 
  maybe you 'll learn something today . 
  i 'll look at deaths caused by capitalism and communism since '45 - we have to establish an equal time period for both . 
  let 's start with your claim . 
  capitalist deaths . 
  first thing , capitalist economic crisis . 
  indeed , crisis can kill , but how many people ? 
  great depression caused 100-200 starvation deaths - `` in new york city in 1931 , there were 20 known cases of starvation ; in 1934 , there were 110 deaths caused by hunger . '', 
  ^ [ 1 ] ( http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&amp;psid=3434 ) . 
  also , pretty much every crisis from black monday to recent housing collapse causes suicides and substantial harm to level of living . 
  next we have wars waged `` in name of capitalism '' . 
  most of these are highly disputable , but i 'll bite and list all that i can : wars waged by west to keep their assets : [ iranian coup d'etat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) - `` 300-800 dead '' [ suez crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) - ~ 4000 killed [ us invasion on panama ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_invasion_of_panama ) - ~ 300 killed wars waged by west to keep colonial power : [ first indochina war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_indochina_war ) - ~ 700,000 killed [ ifni war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ifni_war ) - ~ 8500 killed [ bizerte crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bizerte_crisis ) - ~ 650 killed [ portugese colonial war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_colonial_war ) - ~ 85,000 killed [ falklands war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falklands_war ) - ~ 900 killed other wars involving capitalist countries for various , disputable purposes like oil and sphere of influence : [ korean war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ) - ~ 3,5 million killed [ vietnam war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnam_war ) - `` total civilian dead : 465,000 -- 2,500,000 total dead : 1,102,000 -- 3,886,026 '' [ bay of pigs invasion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bay_of_pigs_invasion ) - ~ 300 killed [ indo-pakistani war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-pakistani_war_of_1971 ) - ~ 12000 killed [ gulf war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_war ) - ~ 40,000 killed [ soviet war in afghanistan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_in_afghanistan ) - ~ 1,000,000 killed [ war in afghanistan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_afghanistan_ ( 2001 % e2 % 80 % 9314 ) - ~ 60,000 killed [ iraq war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraq_war ) - ~ 600,000 killed another aspect is part of society that was harmed due to internal and external capitalism , causing poverty , it 's impossible to assert how much of it is caused by capitalism , but i 'll agree that it does in thousands . 
  there are also victims of various machinations and lies of corporations - again , going in thousands . 
  _____ but now let 's look at communism . 
  first - communist revolution itself can be bloody : [ chinese revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_communist_revolution ) - ~ 1,750,000 killed [ cuban revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuban_revolution ) - ~ 5000 killed [ communist-led first indochina war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_indochina_war ) - ~ 700,000 killed [ laotian civil war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laotian_civil_war ) - `` 20,000-70 ,000 total dead '' [ cambodian civil war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambodian_civil_war ) - `` 200,000 - 300,000 killed '' [ communist insurgency in philippines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_insurgency_in_the_philippines ) - ~ 40,000 killed [ naxalite-maoist insurgency ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naxalite%e2%80%93maoist_insurgency ) - ~ 15,000 killed next we have wars caused by communists , for various reasons - sphere of influence , enforcing communist rule , etc. 
  many of these will be repeat of same table from capitalist wars , since i do n't think anyone would dispute that vietnam war should n't be accounted to communism . 
  here we go : [ korean war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ) - ~ 3,5 million killed [ vietnam war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnam_war ) - `` total civilian dead : 465,000 -- 2,500,000 total dead : 1,102,000 -- 3,886,026 '' [ hungarian revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) - ~ 6500 killed [ tibetian uprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_tibetan_uprising ) - ~ 85,000 killed [ indo-pakistani war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-pakistani_war_of_1971 ) - ~ 12000 killed [ angolan civil war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angolan_civil_war ) - ~ 510,000 killed [ cambodian-vietnamese war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambodian%e2%80%93vietnamese_war ) - ~ 200,000 killed [ soviet war in afghanistan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_in_afghanistan ) - ~ 1,000,000 killed another tendency of communism is to cause various crimes against humanity : campaign to suppress couterrevolutionaries : `` figures vary on the total number of death as a result of the campaign . 
  yang kuisong notes that while the ** official estimates say 712,000 were executed ** the actual number is likely much higher , [ 1 ] ** while li changyu puts the figure at 2 million . 
  ** [ ... ] daniel goldhagen estimated that the death toll for the period 1949-1953 ** could be as high as 10 million . 
  ** '' [ great leap forward ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_leap_forward ) : `` estimates of the death toll range from 18 million [ 4 ] to 45 million , [ 5 ] with ** estimates by demographic specialists ranging from 18 million to 32.5 million . 
  ** '' cultural revolution : `` sinologists roderick macfarquhar and michael schoenhals estimate that ** between 750,000 and 1.5 million people were killed in the violence of the cultural revolution , in rural china alone . 
  ** '' [ cambodian genocide ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambodian_genocide ) : 1,5-3 million bulgaria : `` dinyu sharlanov , in his book history of communism in bulgaria , accounts for about 31,000 people killed under the regime between 1944 and 1989 . '', 
  east germany : `` according to valentino , between 80,000 and 100,000 people may have been killed in east germany beginning in 1945 as part of political repression by the soviet union . '', 
  romania : `` according to valentino , between 60,000 and 300,000 people may have been killed in romania beginning in 1945 as part of agricultural collectivization and political repression . '', 
  communist vietnam : '' it is estimated that some 50,000 [ 147 ] to 172,000 [ 146 ] people perished in the campaigns against wealthy farmers and landowners . 
  rosefielde discusses much higher estimates that range from 200,000 to 900,000 '' `` r.j. rummel has estimated that 1.7 million were killed by the government of vietnam '' ethiopia : `` it is estimated that between 30,000 and 500,000 people were killed over the course of the red terror . '', 
  north korea : `` r.j. rummel has estimated that [ ... ] 1.6 million [ were killed ] in north korea ( not counting the 1990s famine ) '' `` estimates of the death toll vary widely . 
  out of a total population of approximately 22 million , ** somewhere between 240,000 and 3,500,000 north koreans died from starvation or hunger-related illnesses ** , with the deaths peaking in 1997 . '', 
  poland : `` r.j. rummel has estimated that [ ... ] 2.5 million [ were killed ] in poland and yugoslavia '' ________ do i even have to go on ? 
  per nations capita and per year ? 
  much less . 
  `` capitalism is just as bad '' circlejerk is so shortsighted it 's quite pathetic to see . 
  yep . 
  and that 's the problem of communism . 
  it 's a system so bad , so wrong and so incompatible with human nature - it ca n't even reach its full form before failing miserably and killing millions of people . 
  i watched cgp grey too !, 
  hello sweden , welcome to the club of countries responsible for all evil in the world according to russia . 
  there 's cookies and punch by the door . 
  any attempt at translating weight of a slur is quite hard . 
  nevertheless , `` murzyn '' is not a pc word that should come out of an official 's mouth . 
  it might not be as heavy as `` negro '' , but comparing it to english `` moor '' is ridiculous . 
  `` murzyn '' is slurish , and is far from being safe like `` moor '' . 
  and repeating stupid shit someone else said is somehow supposed to make his words better or less amateurish ? 
  i love how pis supporters love to say `` previous government did similar things '' , as if that meant anything . 
  amateur moves are amateur moves . 
  if they are repeating earlier mistakes , that does n't make them any less amateur .
