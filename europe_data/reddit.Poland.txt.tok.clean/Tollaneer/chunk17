  `` podstawowe '' is a primary school , `` zawodowe '' is a trade secondary school , '' \u015arednie '' is normal/technical secondary school , `` licencjackie '' is 3 years of higher education , and `` wy\u017csze '' is 5 years or above ( comparing education levels and university degrees between systems is a nightmare ), 
  like every person in my country , i was tested by armed forces to see if i 'm `` able-bodied '' . 
  i can tell you - standards were far from rock solid . 
  and again - just because military does its xix-century dance around idea of `` able-bodied '' people , does n't mean that such evaluation is in any way a fair solution to sort out which civilians should get humanitarian help and which should n't . 
  on the top of that - `` able-bodied '' is the simplest matter in ops post . 
  but how would you differentiate the military-oriented and peaceful ? 
  decide what sickness deserves our attention and help ? 
  a prime example of a [ false analogy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_from_analogy#false_analogy ) . 
  this comparison is invalid - you 're comparing situation that at first glance are similar , but actually appear in totally different circumstances . 
  ers have to make that decision , because they have measurably limited room for help . 
  whenever it 's their time , slots in ambulances , beds in hospitals - they have an actual , physical limit . 
  here there 's no such thing - op of this comment chain basically said `` let 's keep ** all ** the weak and sick , and turn away ** all ** young and able '' , based on some imaginary division . 
  if moral conundrum here was `` we have 1000 slots without any possibility to create more , and 5000 migrants '' your comparison would be valid , but when talking about situation * as is * , your analogy is simply wrong . 
  it is impossible to do it fairly - any black-and-white division you 'll make between sick and not sick will be totally artificial and arbitrary . 
  it 's not a good or ethical way to differentiate who should receive help . 
  how would you differentiate between sick and not sick ? 
  able and not able ? 
  who 's old enough to say , and who 's too young ? 
  who is militarized , and who comes with honest , peaceful intentions ? 
  you talk about `` the weak '' , `` the young '' , `` the military '' , creating this illusion that you say something substantial . 
  but in reality , when applied to real-life laws and circumstances , your words mean nothing . 
  humans need enemies . 
  we live in time of peace , so we invent them . 
  redditors are usually quite liberal in most places , so they wo n't hate on gays and foreigners , and instead they turn to bashing `` feminists '' and `` sjw '' , whatever these words mean in their eyes . 
  bbc and reuters are so much worse than fox news , right ? 
  because as we all know , * peace rallies ca n't melt steel beams * . 
  i love how people jump to conspiracy theories before anything about an attack is known . 
  bad stuff happens . 
  you do n't need a giant intelligence agency to perform a terrorist attack . 
  so you do agree with program of grzegorz braun ? 
  he also does bridge !, 
   centrist nowoczesna is leaning heavily towards free market . 
  not to the extend of korwin , but still - to call it centrist ? 
  i would n't agree . 
  trees are summer green , but air is winter cold . 
  conservatives of europe are funded by russia , that 's a known fact . 
  difference is 30 euros monthly and warsaw is a great place to be atm . 
  it 's full of creative , young people , and visible development but at the same time still developing its own scene and atmosphere , so you can see it change . 
  it looks scary and yes - quite hard . 
  but it 's not impossible , broken polish is still quite easy to understand for a listener , and as a foreigner you are fully expected to make mistakes - there 's no social stigma around it . 
  great watch . 
  thanks . 
  ever since that map with `` most popular sport by country '' , i always wondered why lithuania was so in love with basketball . 
  you were super-successful in it ? 
  had a basketball star ? 
  should i mention most of balkan countries and hungary that were n't involved in colonization , gulf war , war in iraq or syrian insurgence , but are heavily hurt by refugee crisis ? 
  unlike you - not everything i say is about whitewashing my own country . 
  i know crimes of my government . 
  so nice of you to judge whole continent through scope of france and uk . 
  it 's not about invasion . 
  they are a rotting economy and we do n't want to connect ours with theirs . 
  they have a long history of bringing their intelligence together with their capital . 
  they are known for mismanagement and corruption , making any deals with them less stable than anything west-bound . 
  russia is just a shitty , unstable partner for anything , which was proven countless times already . 
  i 'd wait for the actual buildings with final words . 
  these over-saturated , false-colour visualizations with non-realistic lighting are n't really reliable . 
  but jumping on `` modern architecture is so pretentious and shitty '' bandwagon is so much easier !, 
  and you can complain and stuff !, 
  individually smelted , handcrafted pieces of aluminium covering a building with 3-story high gates to a theater , that at any point during a show can open to a city square is a `` shipping container '' ? 
  or maybe you have some shipping containers with a light , vinyl membranes that will fill exposition rooms with a soft , dispersed light ? 
  your lack of imagination is astounding . 
  seriously - every time i see people bitching about these visualizations without reading what they actually show i cringe a little inside . 
  this `` boohoo , another block of glass '' bullshit is maddening . 
  mostly after poland got [ this ] ( https://fs.smcloud.net/murator-architekturav4/photos/t/22244/wnetrze_75391.jpg ) inside a `` block of glass '' , and [ this ] ( http://archinea.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/filharmonia-szczecin-00.jpg ) out of a `` boring white facade '' . 
  that building is great and a prime example how `` a block of glass '' can turn out great . 
  main hall is mindblowing . 
  yeah , but then cities , mostly the boroughs of commieblocks and pre-war infrastructure , are experiencing biggest wave of [ suburbanization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suburbanization ) ever . 
  biggest net migration is experienced not in large cities , but donut of suburbs around them . 
  looking from outside , slovenia always seemed for me as `` the weird one '' of eastern bloc , pretty much since 1945 . 
  already within non-soviet-aligned yugoslavia , with heightened contact with italy due to geographic proximity , managed to pull out masterfully during the yugoslavian wars and then reaped all the benefits of being a small country and being near the west . 
  you guys were dealt good cards and then proceeded to play them even better - and it paid off . 
  polish morgan freeman is a woman . 
  [ krystyna czub\u00f3wna ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/krystyna_czub%c3%b3wna ) - she 's a classic of documentary/nature voice overs , with amazing and soothing voice fit for the topic ( she does n't really do fiction ) . 
  [ here 's a sample ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r0fcubib8s&amp;t=6m44s ) . 
  not much , honestly . 
  probably the '' [ winter landscape with a bird trap ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/pieter_brueghel_the_younger_-_winter_landscape_with_a_bird-trap_-_wga03617.jpg ) '' by pieter brueghel the younger . 
  not to be confused with the classic '' [ the return of the hunters ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/pieter_bruegel_the_elder_-_hunters_in_the_snow_%28winter%29_-_google_art_project.jpg/1280px-pieter_bruegel_the_elder_-_hunters_in_the_snow_%28winter%29_-_google_art_project.jpg ) '' by brueghel the older . 
  depends on how you frame it . 
  [ this is the same building ] ( http://i.imgur.com/umjoxxg.jpg ) , just from different perspective . 
  warsaw has tons of euro-like places , and contrary to usual story - no , not all of it is rebuilt . 
  old town , i.e. 
  medieval part , is rebuilt post-war . 
  but whole parts of xviii and xix century warsaw are authentic . 
  also - remember that 1/3 of pre-war population of warsaw was jewish . 
  this world collapsed during the war . 
  citizens , workers and owners of massive swaths of warsaw , sometimes whole families - gone . 
  guy on the left is antoni dydycz - some random , low-importance bishop . 
  guy on the right , jan szyszko , was an mp at the time the picture was made , now he 's minister of environment . 
  the event is hubertus w\u0119growski - a local folk festival , related to st. hubertus , state forests and forestry overall . 
  nothing notable . 
  it 's just some silly bullshit from a deeply catholic countryside . 
  damn , pis is so good at making themselves appear `` anti-establishment '' and powered by ideology and not money . 
  i can not believe people still eat that shit up right off their hands . 
  do n't be stupid - you do n't win an election in a 38-million country without representing some lobby groups and without being funded by some corporations and rich people . 
  pis , like any other big party on this planet , has shadowy figures behind them . 
  this might not be outright corruption , but it is `` helping friends of a party '' kind of move . 
  and just as `` bad '' as most of humanity . 
  are you suggesting that politicians are ... normal people like you and me ?!, 
  preposterous !, 
   no , they supported sending it into the commission because they simply could n't flush 500k signatures supporting the bill down the drain aka vote against in the first hearing .
