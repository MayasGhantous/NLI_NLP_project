  if he and passengers would n't react to `` unknown package '' the causality count might have been much higher . 
  inb4 false flag accusations - there 's a sejm reading of controversial anti-terrorism bill today, 
  i guess there was nothing newsworthy happening in azerbaijan and armenia recently . 
  because modern art often uses scandal and media machine as tools of expression . 
  breaking the taboo , combined with following media attention was used to shed light on a problems of journalism in erdogan 's turkey . 
  a week ago turkish journalism was barely mentioned , now it 's a major topic . 
  it 's far from childish or naive , because it 's an example of professional craftsmanship of public debate . 
  i always preferred [ this intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnla4b-pbg ) , you know - since it has entire history of human race , including earth imploding , sequenced to toccata and fugue . 
  well , that happened before : http://www.polenvoornederlanders.nl/?page_id=5127&amp;lang=en, 
  brave and professional - this was counter-terrorism at it 's best . 
  the reaction was swift enough to prevent any civilian casualities , the preperator was fully neutralized but not killed , and there was no collateral damage . 
  he seems not happy about any part of his existence . 
  on every picture he looks like an old , tired and sick loner that he is . 
  so you did n't read the article , you do n't plan on reading the article , and you decided to comment anyway . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  if you could you read the article instead of the headline , before spouting your cliches , that would be really nice of you . 
  thanks . 
  in the past 48 hours warsaw stations maxed at 238 and 260 aqi for pm2 .5 . 
  in bia\u0142ystok it reached 274 aqi . 
  so air in bia\u0142ystok was actually , at least for a while , worse than anything warsaw experienced last two days . 
  and , even right now it 's comparable , with pm2 .5 in warsaw at 160/192 and in bia\u0142ystok at 155 . 
  and using another [ source ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ueiwj7j.jpg ) - bia\u0142ystok has a higher levels of pm2 .5 s than any station in warsaw ( note the labels , for some reason bia\u0142ystok wio\u015a station does n't track pm10s ) . 
  * once again - there 's no room here to lie to yourself with some crappy regionalism . 
  this is a countrywide issue that screws all of us and with rattle health of poles for decades . 
  and being in denial and throwing `` not as bad as '' - isms is the worst possible reaction . 
  there 's no shame in being fucked by dysfunctional environmental protections . 
  * just as a note - while both of these sources are fine and quite established in anti-smog communities , their data is incomparable directly , since they use different gauges . 
  the `` 200-something '' in the first one is n't the same as `` 200-something percent '' in the second . 
  first one is using [ aqi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_quality_index ) , the latter is using percentage of eu norm . 
  both have their quirks , but the overall tendency can be read from them . 
  sorry to burst your bubble , but bia\u0142ystok and rest of podlasie was just as shit as rest of the country today when it comes to air pollution . 
  your petty local patriotism wo n't get you clean lungs . 
  you live in modern world , full of hateful people . 
  germany has these , france has them , you 're naive or deluded to believe that any country is free of homophobia or religious nutjobs . 
  it 's not a massive problem , but both pomoc2002 and pascha are full-on conversion therapies with all of their bullshit . 
  on the top of that - i 've seen german and american conversion therapies offering their `` services '' for poles . 
  you 'd be surprised what filth exists beyond your bubble . 
  prescribing homeopathy is n't illegal in most of eu , despite it being complete bullshit . 
  but that 's also largely dollar getting stronger . 
  what really needs to change is your attitude . 
  and i do n't mean your approach on how to deal with muslims , only your shitty , counterproductive thought pattern . 
  we have to finally admit that there 's no * approach that works * , and no one source of the problem . 
  these massive , complex problems work in a multi-directional way , with multiple , often looping causes and effects . 
  that 's the goddamn core of the problem here . 
  if it were easy to solve or simple to understand , we would n't struggle with it . 
  and yes - for your information , attitude of the `` native population '' is one of the reasons for the higher crime rates and low assimilation rates of the migrant population . 
  it 's not the sole reason , but by dismissing it you 're just as counterproductive as people who focus on it too heavily . 
  and the same goes for most arguments or data raised in the debate around this issue - they 're often true to some degree , but society is split between people who outright deny its existence and those who focus on the argument too heavily and use that data as a reason to deny other pieces of data . 
  we have noise barriers , ladies and gentlemen !, 
   is this a stereotype about poland ? 
  halfway finished homes are a common sight in the countryside . 
  sometimes it 's minor things like this one , but sometimes you can see buildings where people live in the ground floor with upper ones having no amenities , including windows . 
  aiming too high and running out of cash halfway through the construction is a typical story in poland . 
  my post and complaining are a part of the multidisciplinary polish experience . 
  the amount of concentrated polishness in this image is amazing - the hussars , home that is unfinished ( notice the balcony ) but has a satellite dish , these cheap flower pots from obi , ugly autumn weather , parking lots cobbled with cheapest concrete brick , and king of poland jesus christ himself . 
  languages shape societies , they say . 
  although this is more of a situation of polish being highly flexible with prefixes and suffixes , and pretty much every set of prefix + core having a colloquial use . 
  '' * od *** wali\u0107 ** '' is basically the word '' ** wali\u0107 ** '' , `` to hit , to strike ( in a slightly vulgar manner ) '' with a suffix '' * od - * '' - `` from - '' , `` of - '' , `` off - '' , in a counter , away direction . 
  another example of this in work : `` i 'm ** tearing ** * off * a sticker '' would be '' * od *** rywam ** nalepk\u0119 '' , with the part '' ** rywam ** '' meaning `` to tear '' ( exactly `` to tear '' is `` rwa\u0107 '' , but in that example it 's in 1st person , present tense , so it 's a bit different ) . 
  in this instance , the word works mostly in a literal sense . 
  but now - you can add pretty much any prefix to that core , and every has a common usage : '' * prze * rywam '' in a literal sense is closest to `` i 'm tearing across '' , like - tickets in a cinema are `` przerywane '' , but it 's also used when talking about stopping a conversation , a call - `` przerwa\u0107 po\u0142\u0105czenie '' , `` przerwa\u0107 rozmow\u0119 '' . 
  '' * z * rywam '' is literally `` i 'm tearing downwards '' , `` i 'm tearing down a poster '' would be `` zrywam plakat '' , but you can also `` zerwa\u0107 '' with someone - end a relationship . 
  but do n't worry - you can also `` podrywa\u0107 '' - to flirt . 
  '' * roz * rywam '' is literally `` i 'm tearing apart '' , `` eksplozja rozerwa\u0142a budynek '' is `` explosion tore the building apart '' . 
  but when pain is unbearable it 's `` rozrywaj\u0105cy '' . 
  and you 'll notice that this is obviously also ok in english , with `` pain tearing me apart '' being an ok idiom . 
  with that last one ^ * i think we 're getting at a core of what i wanted to show - what 's two words in other languages - a core word and with another one denoting a direction , in polish it 's often a single word , that is built out of a core and a directional prefix . 
  this is why we have ' a word ' for everything - what would be a two word idiom in many languages , here is packaged into one . 
  ^ * which ^ is ^ in ^ no ^ way ^ exhausting ^ the ^ list ^ - ^ you ^ can ^ also ^ wyrwa\u0107 , ^ dorwa\u0107 , ^ narwa\u0107 , ^ oderwa\u0107 , ^ poderwa\u0107 , ^ naderwa\u0107 , ^ oberwa\u0107 ^ and ^ narwa\u0107 . 
  or alternatively `` to do work without putting in any effort ; to half-ass work '' as in `` odwali\u0142em fuch\u0119 '' . 
  because they do n't feel that shame you 're projecting into them right now . 
  totally - nope . 
  partially - hell fucking yep . 
  the vast lack of understanding of homosexuality combined with even vaster lack of understanding of pedophilia . 
   there 's one church that christ established and its doctrines have been preserved from error for about 2,000 years . 
  well , he did n't establish the one that went through 21 catholic ecumenical councils . 
  your assumption that bible should be followed word for word and that religion should n't change to suit modern times is just that - an arbitrary assumption . 
  just like the idea that a lesbian could be a priest is just an arbitrarily decided rule . 
  there 's no room for `` error '' here because it 's all purely settled on a social contract without any real basis . 
  the religions , as virtual creations of human culture , define themselves . 
  yep . 
  it 's called `` unexplained '' because we do n't have hard data about it , but discrimination is always brought up as a probable explanation ( or one of the explanations ) of at least the part of this gap . 
   entirely not really . 
  almost . 
  there 's still a 3-6 % * unexplained * wage gap , when controlling for things like education , career path , age , experience , type of workplace , area when work is being done , etc. . 
   do you want to have communist judges ? 
  yep . 
  why not . 
  they 'll all die/retire within next 10-20 years and the system will be purified . 
  and the alternative proposed by pis basically fucks up the system for good - every new government will now go through with their own purges . 
  including the dreaded * left * when eventually poles become fed up with kaczynski 's bullshit . 
  i like how you basically copied and pasted one of these ancient , moronic stereotypes only because it remotely fits the situation . 
  i have nothing against you holding dumb opinions , but at least do n't be this lazy about them . 
  he 's not going to stop . 
  at this point , it 's quite clear that he really is that sad , lonely and demented man everyone jokes about . 
  the only real chance for poland is that his own circle will tear him apart when he gets weaker . 
  c'mon , just because he 's from lubuskie does n't mean it 's not polan . 
  eh , if we were having a case of * tovarisches * it would n't be so terrible . 
  sadly it 's more of a * mein f\u00fchrers * type of situation . 
  meaningless when talking about how society reacted to it .
