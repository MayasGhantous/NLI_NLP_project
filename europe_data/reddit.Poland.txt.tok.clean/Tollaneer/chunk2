  neither is one between germany and france with great britain . 
  there were dozens of these . 
  but you call it a `` world war '' , because it 's a part in a continuous spiral of wars that involved more and more countries and eventually led to truly global conflict . 
  that chain of wars started on september 1st , not 3rd . 
  as a pm ? 
  maybe in the next elections in 2015 . 
  now the two real contestants are marshal of the sejm and former minister of health [ ewa kopacz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ewa_kopacz ) and current minister of defence [ tomasz siemoniak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomasz_siemoniak ) . 
  my bets are on kopacz , but we 'll see . 
  bitching about everything all the time is not critical thinking . 
  it 's bitching about everything all the time . 
  ** palace of culture and science ** would be a unique wonder for russia , that gets built in an allied country ( you theoretically build in one of your cities , but it plops in the capital of some other country ) , and it blocks breaking of such alliance for 15 turns . 
  this is exactly why its horrible and should n't be ever attempted again . 
  socialist oppressive dictatorships are a direct outcome of an attempted implementation of communist system . 
  that 's the biggest issue of communism . 
  it 's so broken and disconnected from reality , you ca n't even fully bring it to life before it crashes and morphs into a horrid system . 
  it 's not like all this spectrum of system that spoil over time after they work for a bit . 
  communism is so bad of an idea , it breaks before launch . 
  sadly it 's also a fuel for next generations of delusional idealists who believe in it and dance around with their `` there never were a communist state '' nonsense . 
  yeah . 
  there never was a truly communist state . 
  because it 's so awful nobody even got it there . 
  communists are like these nuts who still try to invent a perpetual motion machine , talking about how it was never done properly and failing to see ** why ** it was never done properly . 
  my internal victoria 2 player is screaming . 
  not even that . 
  that 's 99,1 % of people who were taught , and were literate at ** some point ** . 
  [ functional illteracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/functional_illiteracy#prevalence ) numbers are much , much worse . 
  educate yourself before writing . 
  communism is a horrible system , that should n't be implemented anywhere , but it does n't mean that it does everything wrong . 
  one of the major points of communism is mandatory basic education . 
  also - that connection with lublin is ridiculous . 
  in reality it would be warsaw-krak\u00f3w and warsaw-katowice directly , via [ central rail line ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pkp_rail_line_4 ) , that is already being modernized to support high-speed rail , and it 's sort-of a y-shaped line that links both katowice and krak\u00f3w to warsaw . 
  rail is more expensive when you want to create new connections ( although , if you count price of airports and airport expansions it changes significantly ) . 
  but use of rail is cheaper , and with european distances high-speed rail is faster than flying . 
  pish posh . 
  there are rules of aesthetics in art . 
  architecture is art . 
  and it 's ruled by similar laws of composition , proportions , perspective , colour and lighting as paintings , sculptures and film . 
  these laws , that come from mathematics , physics and way humans perceive world , are a given . 
  they 're not subjective . 
  colour-matching is deeply rooted in our brains . 
  golden proportion looks good because it 's really nice mathematically . 
  perspective is just how reality works . 
  you ca n't jump over these things . 
  and with this building we have a natural way of perceiving things as stable or unstable . 
  it 's something that we just have , after living on this planet for years and gathering info about what 's stable and what 's unstable . 
  this building looks unstable . 
  unstable things are unnerving and not light , which i think was intention here . 
  it 's not a good idea for a building to look like that . 
  i 'm not talking about construction , only about aesthetics . 
  it just look bad . 
  you have n't seen good modern architecture . 
  do n't circlejerk around dubai-style towers , only notice quality stuff . 
  la d\u00e9fense is not paris proper you think of . 
   because poland does n't hush journalists ... oh wait . 
  because there was n't a major journalist-run scandal just a month ago where nobody hushed anyone ... oh wait . 
  i 've seen this project like two years ago . 
  have they finally started building it ? 
  and i do n't really like the form . 
  skyscraper might be crazy , tall and weird , but it should never look like it 's unstable . 
  i get the idea here - the clever placement of two towers causes one to be always seen in the `` thinner at the bottom '' state , and other having more stable looking silhouette . 
  but this does n't change the fact that one on the left over here looks wrong . 
  i wo n't make a final judgement yet , since it 's just a visualization , and it might be doing a bad deed to the project and in real-life light it will look better , but for now i do n't like this project . 
  there 's a simple solution that quietly fixed unemployment for decades - we will cut another days from our work week . 
  this is the overall direction - we 're going into the world where machines do everything for us , so we can lavish in everything that is n't work , breaking away pieces of time needed for work . 
  less workdays per capita = work for more people . 
  bigger automatization = cheaper stuff , so people can still afford it despite producing less work . 
  of course - the unemployment will rise anyway , but robots make stuff cheap , so providing for the unemployed will be easier too . 
  nice / r/karmaconspiracy right there . 
  yes . 
  your ignorance and lack of knowledge overwrites historical facts . 
  it 's so weird . 
  my country is one of the few in the world that never made homosexuality punishable , even when countries like germany and austria did , but today it 's a cesspool of homophobia . 
  tolerance perishes quickly , i guess . 
  fact that they did it to anyone is enough . 
  yes , but such practices are enough to rightfully tell a country that you wo n't deal with them when it comes to extraditions . 
  it 's not the case here , but holding extraditions is a normal form of sanctioning a country and protesting way they treat prisoners . 
  for example - many countries that condemn capital punishment , wo n't let go of a person that has a death penalty on their head . 
  dae think / r/europe today is shit ?!, 
  upunions on the left . 
  i 'd say that war-defined lines along mountain ranges and rivers are much more logical than straight-lines-in-the-sand of africa . 
  americas have totally artificial usa-canada border , not to mention how us itself is split . 
  asia is just as war-defined as europe . 
  so really there 's only one true continent of logical borders . 
  australia . 
  k , we can switch, 
  it 's true that for european standards warsaw centre is has a very systematic and grid ~ ~ - lock ~ ~ [ road pattern ] ( http://www.mappery.com/maps/warsaw-city-with-bus-routes-map.gif ) but it 's very much pre-war , and has basis in how the city was built and the terrain on which it was built , and not ww2 . 
  watch the video , make logical conclusions . 
  zoning laws around it talk about one building ~ 30m shorter than it , and two that will be few meters taller . 
  so that part is settled . 
  and for the last 7-8 years there was some talking about a ~ 260m tall building near the warszawa centralna railway station . 
  but that comes from some investment corporation mulling around , so i would n't bet everything on that happening . 
  sky 's low in cyprus , easy to scratch . 
  seeing how it 's different from other towers on the list - i have to warn you on this photo it 's in only view where you can catch it with no modern-skyscraper background . 
  this is how it looks like from pretty much exactly opposite side : https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3730/9428871147_35a0ccace2_b.jpg, 
   all new trolleys are solaris trollino good choice . 
  gib us moneyz . 
  corporations are also out to push anything that will bring viewers to the screens , including smearing of government and lobby groups . 
  government-controlled tv will be ** always ** loyal to its group . 
  corporation-controlled tv wo n't . 
  you just have to pay more .
