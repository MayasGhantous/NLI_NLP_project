  tom neuwirth came out as homosexual in 2007 . 
  or we can base our opinions on actual statistics and not a silly contest that is watched by a certain demographic ? 
  you know . 
  i think that sounds teeny-tiny more reasonable . 
  http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/ilga-europe-rainbow-map_5198e5ff9736c.jpg oh look . 
   hey it may be bad here , but it 's nowhere near russian levels . 
   ukraine on the other hand sent a drag queen in 2007 and nearly won verka serduchka < 3 certainly best performance that have n't won an eurovision . 
  flashy , extremely campy , catchy as hell . 
  it 's quintessentially eurovision-y . 
  you ca n't make a gay fairy tale without someone noticing and waving their arms . 
  if you wo n't make it a ` selling point ' , conservatives will do it for you . 
  people like that do n't outright say `` i hate gay people '' any more , because it 's not pc today . 
  but words like `` i would n't want any children of mine being exposed to these things so early on either '' are still filled with prejudice and most importantly - idea that homosexualism is a deviancy , and more of a fetish than equivalent of heterosexual relationship . 
  that same-sex love is somehow a cesspool of sex in a bigger way than affection between people of different sexes , and children should be shielded from it . 
  eurovision should drop having a jury . 
  eurovision is not a serious contest , it 's not palme d'or of musical industry , it 's practically a multi-million euro silly game . 
  we come every year to have some campy fun and that 's it . 
  why then have some jury of god-knows-who ( i do n't even know half of people from my own country ) to go around and pretend like it 's all totally serious and important ? 
  sword with blade shorter than its handle . 
  [ insert phallic-centred insult pointed towards fascists ], 
  with books like this i always wonder if they are written in a few days/weeks , or do the propaganda machines have a bunch of pre-made books where you just swap some stuff and give it a go . 
  use of natural gas by cng and lng vehicles is negligible compared to household and industrial use . 
  and all data i found says that because americans have a preference for cng buses - fleets of such vehicles are comparable between us and eu . 
  also - our has [ fucking rainbows ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/71311878.jpg ), 
  it 's not really copy-pasting , it 's just an architectural style . 
  [ pkin ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/pkin_widziany_z_wfc.jpg ) in warsaw is similar only in overall concepts to [ any ] ( http://www.veditour.ru/img_resort/408-moskva-img_b.jpg ) [ of the ] ( http://students.sras.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mgu_seven_sisters.jpg ) [ ` seven sisters ' ] ( http://www.angryboar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/stalins_red_gates_skyscraper_1.jpg ) - stalinist skyscrapers of moscow . 
  these buildings are no more copies of one another than buildings from height of new york art deco . 
  this is just how communist-era architects wanted or were pressured to make them . 
  also - on the top of moscow , riga and warsaw , soviets also made these in [ kiev ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hotel_ukrayina ) , [ bucharest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casa_presei_libere ) and [ prague ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hotel_crowne_plaza_prague ), 
  a lot of crime that nobody tackles because `` there 's no crime in communism '' , even more poverty that nobody fixes because `` there 's no poverty in communism '' . 
  yeah . 
  great system . 
  it 's a typical skyscraper from times of [ soc-realism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soc-realism ) in art . 
  despite being `` buildings of the people '' , architecture of socialist realism was mostly based on palaces an rich tenements . 
  skyscrapers also take a lot from late american art deco towers . 
  you probably also have some of the socialist realism low-rise buildings from 50s that look like [ this ] ( http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z229/debbiespeed/nowa%20huta%20-%20new%20steel%20mill/dscn4082.jpg ) , [ this ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/_cr5r4mlervi/trqd9eysjmi/aaaaaaaaaao/vlemdwd65km/s1600/manfred+br%25c3%25bcckels.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/0/10643/z10643590q,plac-konstytucji.jpg ) . 
  not really . 
  itt : people who do n't understand the idea of eurovision i get that americans might be missing it , but damn - being cynical redditors apparently makes you blind when you have to distinguish actually crappy from `` this is the idea behind all of this '' and `` we 're just having fun being silly '' crappy . 
  http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/731/143/3e3.jpg you do realize that it 's meant to be campy and silly , right ? 
  ruch narodowy exists in media only for few hours on every 11th of november . 
  and mikke existed in the background since the beginnings of third republic - he even was a member of sejm in early 90s . 
  he always goes up when there 's a situation where people do n't know who to vote for . 
  yep . 
  i mean - clergy members and some politicians sometimes come up with some ridiculous statements , but these are only individuals , often met with big outcry when they voice their opinions . 
  but we do n't have any ` extremist christian ' groups , and ` extremist conservative ' are ridiculously disjointed bunches , mostly consisting of 20-something guys that leave it after a few years and football-team-related hooligans . 
  can confirm . 
  from the second perspective - in a situation where beds are sparse , nobody would ever deny a bed to someone else . 
  three people getting really close and sleeping on one bed is still more appropriate than sending someone to sleep on a floor . 
  from the title and recent news - nope , it 's about sex education . 
  cementing that [ biggest exporter in the world position ] ( http://www.freshplaza.com/article/114803/poland-passes-china-as-largest-apple-exporter ) , huh . 
  you mean that we do n't flail our hands and yell `` we 're doing big politics over here ! '', 
  like these two do ? 
  i guess we do n't . 
  but damn , putin really has a nice pr grip on europeans with inferiority complex , despite ruling a country that 's on a continuous downward spiral since the 80s and its last 30 years are nothing but getting less and less relevant . 
  of course americans take europe seriously . 
  we 're a market of 700 million rich customers . 
  you deal with that seriously even if you 're on bad relations with them . 
  but they are n't . 
  europe and usa are pretty good economic pals and cooperate on many levels . 
  and that 's what counts and what means power today . 
  modern politics are not about tanks or speeches . 
  it 's all about money , gdp and corporations . 
  and russia takes us seriously because russian economy is nothing without their gas and oil in our pipelines . 
  i believe this image was made on / int / , i 've been seeing it there for0 like a year or two . 
  the data is real , but choice of categories is typical `` hurrdurr usa is fat and aggressive '' . 
  classic euroscepticism - seeing faults in the system and saying that `` everything is wrong , and unified europe is far from ** any ** kind of political power '' . 
  and then no one takes them seriously . 
  only it does n't have 8.4 % . 
  going by an average from last few polls they do n't even reach election threshold . 
  shhh , shhh . 
  many people had their period of believing in ` korwinizm ' . 
  it 's just a passing thing , sign of adolescence coming . 
  but it usually goes away before they reach voting age . 
  only thing that vladimir putin does right is scaring blind westerners into believing he 's on top of their governments . 
  he lost ukraine , he lost olympics , he lost germany 's faith in him , he lost stabilization of dealings with rest of europe . 
  gas ? 
  we might depend on his gas now , but now pipeline after pipeline , port after port , europe will bleed him to death . 
  argument of price lost support after ukraine . 
  crimea ? 
  it 's a last moment cry from a panicked person . 
  he invaded a tiny chunk after loosing hold on a whole country . 
  putin made a lot of noise , but in the end - everything around him is falling apart . 
  a lousy tzar made from papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 . 
  main symbol of warsaw is its [ coat of arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_warsaw ) , and while `` syrenka '' featured on it is everywhere , we do n't do flag too much . 
  good , fresh pasta with pesto genovese is one of these simple , but mindblowingly tasty things . 
  or maybe eurofighters ? 
  that 's just arguably bad management . 
  but nothing justifies , undoubtedly barbaric , act of burning down pieces of art and destroying public property , no matter what they mean or what quality they are . 
  city is rebuilding it because some group of scum destroyed thing that belongs to everyone . 
  it 's pathetic that i have to explain that to you . 
  i know it will . 
  you ca n't educate barbarians , that 's just how they are . 
  you really are that sad of a person ? 
  i do n't think this issue get much attention at all over here . 
  it 's just stuck in a limbo where we agree that drinking at ages 15 and up is bad , but it 's also so widespread and quietly accepted that nobody tackles it . 
  few years ago there was a moment when shopkeepers selling alcohol to minors were a topic , but that passed too ( without much change , you can still buy it easily without id ) . 
  when almost everyone tries alcohol between 14 and 16 , i guess it 's not really seen as an issue . 
  but i can only say that about my country . 
  shit is probably different in other countries of europe . 
  like in places where legal purchase age is 16 .
