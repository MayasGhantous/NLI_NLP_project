  oh , another difference in poland is there 's no `` legal ** drinking ** age '' , only `` legal ** purchase ** age '' , there 's no punishment for consumption . 
  you ca n't sell alcohol to minors , you ca n't give it to minors , but if you are a minor and just happen to quietly chug down alcohol in private environment , there 's no law against that . 
  there are better and worse places , sure . 
  but comment sections of sites like wp.pl and onet.pl are disgusting cesspools of racism , bigotry , sexism and homophobia unlike any other . 
  and on yt at least people like that get downvoted and steamrolled back to their caves , but here everyone else is gone and what is left is a circlejerk of bigots . 
  maybe it 's good , because these people stay in their fapfestivals and do n't spew their shit somewhere else , but still - comment sections of most polish news sites are absolutely terrible . 
  and you base that on what ? 
  former soviet union having high numbers where there 's almost no modern immigration ? 
  how finland is most violent from scandinavian states , even though it 's most homogeneous ? 
  how cities of western europe that are filled with immigrants , not counting brussels ( look higher for explanation on situation in belgium ) are more peaceful than rural areas that usually consist mostly local folk ? 
  if this suggests anything about immigration it 's that we love to notice crimes done by immigrants , but statistically immigration does n't change homicide rates that drastically as some would suggest . 
  whole internet is one big walled garden of mr. united states . 
  creating alternative one is a step in the good direction . 
  god damn is it so fucking hard to understand ? 
  you want your data to go as directly to receiver as possible . 
  if it has to go through hands of your enemies - you would prefer to route it through the ones that this data will benefit the least . 
  once you 'll route it through europe . 
  once you 'll route it through usa . 
  now you always have to route it though usa . 
  cutting that out is enough to sometimes make a connection more attractive . 
  no , of course they do n't . 
  but read what i 'm writing - if we invest in new fiber lines , they get a choice who spies on them . 
  now they do n't have any . 
  they have to agree to us fucking their data . 
  china . 
  india . 
  indonesia . 
  brazil . 
  argentina . 
  and dozens of other states that have a crapload of interest in connections between europe , asia , africa and south america that are not seen by usa . 
  it 's a freedom of choice kind of thing . 
  they do n't want to be seen by us - we offer them connection not seen by the us . 
  they do n't want to be seen by europe - they route it somewhere else . 
  variety of choice and toppling monopolists ( and usa has an extreme monopole on internet , to the point where they sometimes act like it belongs to them ) never hurt any market . 
  that 's not the case here . 
  right now whole network is almost 100 % americentric - even when i track my connection to china from poland , it goes through atlantic , usa and pacific . 
  by creating a safe haven with lenient laws in europe , that 's also well connected to asia and south america - you get a new product on the market - connections circumventing data-eating machine of us . 
  and circumventing us does n't change anything in connections meant for us , you 'll still connect with north america like you do today . 
  the only difference is in connections between regions that are ** not ** united states , but today still have to route their data through it . 
  it 's a walled garden with only one wall - through the atlantic . 
  damn i hope europe will do everything to fuck with us when it comes to the internet routing . 
  and it 's not about nsa or all this crap - instead of us i will be spied on by germans , french , brits and my own government . 
  that 's just how it is . 
  but us stepped on a biggest pr mine in the history of this industry , and there was no better moment to get a share of it money on this side of atlantic . 
  creating `` walled garden '' combined with laying new cables to south america and asia , circumventing us means more companies of the sector flocking to europe . 
  business is business . 
  for the people who do n't know what 's the deal with abolishing it , cgpgrey made a nice , semi-objective video about dst https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84awtseb2-4, 
  there have been dozens of threats on every head of state in the world . 
  it 's not like there 's a sniper and a bomb behind every corner obama turns . 
  he 's not that important to prepare an attack on him every time he leaves white house . 
  and it 's not like the president of the netherlands on this photo does n't have some people guarding him and his way was n't checked for threats . 
  it 's just that we live in xxi century , where certain people are unimportant in a big game ( even if their positions are ) , and he 's in a peaceful western country and his bicycle trip was prepared by some of the best men dealing with vip safety . 
  because netherlands are vile and aggressive state and if potus dies there it 's obvious that it was the machinations of their regime , that require immediate response . 
  yep . 
  if potus dies , stock market crashes a bit , there 's some political chaos , but nothing really happens . 
  president of usa is an important position , not a person . 
  if nothing happens to your state , there 's no real difference for global stability if it 's 2 more years of obama , or few months of biden and then someone else . 
  museums are probably already nicely stacked on these , but i think if they found something unique they would try to clean the shell . 
  problem with these unexploded devices is that corrosion and age makes them unpredictable and thus extremely dangerous to deal with . 
  any time i hear about it the process is the same - workers find one of these , the work is stopped in that area , sappers are called , they assess the situation - if it 's needed there 's some form of evacuation , one time they found some 1,5 tonne device and they even had to evacuate people from nearby office buildings . 
  then sappers remove it from the site and transport it to their proving ground where it 's safely detonated . 
  mostly ww2 . 
  this happens in europe . 
  while digging 6km of new underground line in warsaw recently , workers found over 600 unexploded ordnances . 
  also - shale gas . 
  probably most relevant for ops question . 
  we were always big enemies of restrictions that eu is putting on shale gas and one of the countries that kind of welcomes it , but always were in this state of `` in-between '' . 
  environmental concerns are alive and well , so politicians were n't sure if it was a better move to push through with playing anti-russian or eco-friendly . 
  post-crimea our pm talked about plans to go with new laws that would ease up and basically greenlight shale gas excavation . 
  it seems putin assumed he would win ukraine in the moment it declined talks about accession treaty . 
  he 's doing some bold moves now , but the truth is - his plans are falling apart . 
  [ yanukovych 's machine ] ( http://yanukovich.info/oleksandr-yanukovych-assets/ ) of stealing a laundering ukrainian money is in danger , all the connected people are panicking , various long-term and short-term plans are on fire , chains of connections are severed , balance of power is disrupted . 
  putin likes to think that he 's tzar , and that he 's russia . 
  but he 's not . 
  amount of `` behind the scenes '' shit going down in there must be crazy , and i think these incidents are effects of network managers pressing on the journalists out of sheer chaos , as it always happens in such situations . 
  it 's a creepy video inspired by modern internet videos of ` creepy ' genre ( think salad fingers ) , only thematically and stylistically settled in low-quality programming of late-communist and early-capitalist eras of our television . 
  and it 's about how to make from paper . 
  you have closed captions . 
  i do n't know . 
  we like to think that there 's this looming evil of domestic violence everywhere , but from tens of people i know , maybe a few had real contact with it . 
  oh the edge . 
  if only you 've read or glanced though the fucking study you talk about before writing . 
  fyi it asked to detail `` act of violence '' . 
  you can see data split in the [ . pdf ] ( http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-at-a-glance_en_0.pdf ) . 
  irrelevant . 
  study asked for certain things and not a subjective view . 
  you can access and clean both search history and `` tags '' that google assigned to you . 
  that 's the issue here . 
  even spain is far away enough for its politicians to think that aiding ukraine with sanctions would n't be feasible internally as a political move , because it means that gas and oil prices will rise . 
  being on the other side of the continent is enough to make people not give a fuck about crimea if it means that they 'll have to pay more for cooking and driving their cars . 
  of course , sorry . 
  i 've only dropped sense for a tighter paraphrase . 
  why do citizens of usa always perceive complexity of global politics as video games and superhero comic books ? 
  it 's been like this for a week . 
  there are and this why they have these flops . 
  they pull out some map made in 1953 from an archive , slap shit on it and give it a go . 
  swedish deluge # 2 : * fucking homo commies or something * edition, 
  yeah . 
  kings and dictators always gave a fuck about their pr amongst simple folk who did n't even associate themselves with a country . 
  b-b-but ouzo is fucking disgusting,
