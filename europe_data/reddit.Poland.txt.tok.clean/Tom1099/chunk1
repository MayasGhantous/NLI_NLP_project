i know . 
  it 's in the video title . 
  but i ca n't watch the video because i 'm currently in the ` wrong country ' . 
  `` this video is unavailable in your country '' i do n't know how to comment it . 
  what about ukrainians and belarusians ? 
  all three eastern slavic countries share rus heritage . 
   the need to counterbalance nato military power much more you assume that russia always * needs * to `` counterbalance nato '' . 
  but russia is n't yet north korea . 
  imagine that europe becomes independent of russian resources . 
  what can russia do ? 
  it ca n't go at war with the whole eu , because it 's a suicide . 
  it ca n't mess in neighbours ' affairs because it is to dependent on europe ( for at least a few decades ) . 
  so it can try to live on their own like north korea and face total economic collapse , try to establish some serious deals with china ( which will draw their attention from europe anyway ) , or it can take pro-western direction . 
  fyi : poland pays the highest price for gas in the whole eu . 
   north korea to sell to south korea brilliant idea . 
  kim will finally have an actual possibility to threaten south korea economically . 
   but not actually doing much they started the whole thing . 
  do you think they would have done so if europe were n't dependent on russia ? 
   it 's better to develop a different energy source that 's easy to say but harder to do . 
  we do n't have good conditions for renewable energy . 
  the first nuclear power plant is still being built . 
  another thing is that gas is usually used for heating , not energy production ( we have coal for that ) . 
  you ca n't change whole infrastructure overnight . 
   on a note of `` neighbors liking you '' how much did estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania liked russia before ukrainian crisis ? 
  russia did not grabbed any land for 23 + years or so , so how did the relationship was going before ? 
  trying to treat russia as a partner when it was acting like , well , russia is one of the arguments used by conservatives against 2007-2014 government . 
  random embargoes , georgian war , messing with the smole\u0144sk plane crash , accusing poland of genocide , glorifying soviet union and hiding the truth about soviet crimes against poland did n't help . 
  all countries have crazy parties and stupid parties , but it seems ukraine will have a reasonable coalition in rada ( poroshenko , people 's front , and maybe samopomich or batkivshchyna ) . 
  one could assume that radicalism and populism would be higher in a country under foreign invasion . 
  in poland gathering similar amount of signatures ( in terms of % of population ) is enough to put a proposed law under vote in parliament . 
  i understand that eci only binds meps to hold a debate and commission to comment on the initiative , but does n't start a legislation process automatically . 
  and that 's basically the only way citizens can affect the legislation process after parliamentary elections , since meps do n't have a right of legislative initiative and reaching to your local european commissioner is difficult , to say at least . 
  in polish double negative is much more common ( and proper : / ) . 
  well , at least we say numbers normally . 
  so , basically , it 's just a petition ? 
  i mean , if you need to gather signatures of one million people , from at least 7 countries , for your parliament to hold a debate , then something is wrong . 
  i can assure you that no one starves in poland . 
  200 000 is the total number of poles who lived in volhynia prior to ww2 . 
  justification = / = reason btw . 
  not 100 000 . 
  100 000 poles were killed by soviet nkvd before in 1937-1938 . 
  volyhnia massacre is ca . 
  50 000 victims . 
  policy of strengthening `` polishness '' ( ? ), 
  was ~ ~ even ~ ~ worse but there 's not much info in english wikipedia . 
  imo the main reason was frustration . 
  ukrainians fall into the worst geopolitical location ever . 
  since 17th century until the fall of ussr there were n't any country that would support establishment of souvereign ukraine . 
  instead they received polonisation , russification and sometimes even ethnic cleansing . 
  edit : stylistic, 
   bandera what many people do n't realise though it was n't bandera who ordered the massacre , but a bunch of other guys from his fraction of upa . 
  since the beginning of the `` ukrainian conflict '' there 's a mass influx of pro-russians in polish web . 
  volhynia massacre is brought up in comments under virtually all news from ukraine even when there 's no connection between that event and the news . 
   the approach reasonable people taking nowadays is `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' , otherwise that conflict will be eternal . 
  i wish that someday presidents of poland , ukraine and other countries ( including russia , i 'm idealistic ) would gather and say ' i apologise for all that ethnic cleansing . 
  now let 's move to developing a future built on cooperation between our nations ' . 
  upa was an enemy of nazis since spring of 1943 - it 's a fact . 
  since then they were fighting with virtually all - poles , germans , soviets , and certainly did n't take order from them . 
   at the time the deal was concluded russia was n't as crazy and it would have been hard to expect the ukraine thing . 
  it was like a 2 years after georgian war . 
  1930s for example . 
   except he wo n't , he has no interests doing so . 
  there is no interest for anyone in most wara , including the current one . 
  over 3000 russians died already in eastern ukraine for minimal gain . 
   russia is n't an ennemy of france and we already pay enough for the former soviet bloc . 
  maybe you would n't have to pay so much if it were n't for your constant ' y is n't an enemy ' , ' x has no interests doing so ' or ` how the east benefits france ', 
  also po\u0142udnica - girl who died just before her wedding ; attacks people in field in the summer ; latawiec ( male ) / latawica ( female ) - flying demon , not too dangerous , after baptism of poland considered a devil having sex with people zmora/mara - demon torturing people when they 're asleep , usually by drinking one 's blood wampir/w \u0105pierz ( vampire ) - it 's qute known , is n't it ? 
  if you are in cracow , in the museum under the market there are corpses buried in anti-vampiric manner . 
   hugo simberg just came here to say the album lacks imo the best finnish ( and one of world 's best ) painter !, 
  ( the garden of death has been painted in 19th century ) . 
  if anyone 's interested here 's more of his art : [ album ] ( http://www.museumsyndicate.com/artist.php?artist=800 ) , [ the wounded angel ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/the_wounded_angel_-_hugo_simberg.jpg ), 
  yep , there are other solutions , but i was commenting on the lithuanian law proposal , not danish law , which seems to be an example of what is good children protection act . 
  however , some politicians overuse the argument of `` children protection '' to get more votes and try to pass often poorly written laws that can sometimes make more harm than good . 
  `` think about children !!! '', 
  child protection laws sound nice , clever etc. 
  but they also have to be constructed in a way that * wo n't harm * the children . 
  my mom is working in primary school and some of the stories about how `` child protection '' works are horrible . 
  a kid does n't show up in school for a few months , and if he does he 's beaten - that 's ok . a kid that gets a decent care from lone mother , always does his homework etc. 
  but his mother is an alcoholic and is found drunk once - police arrest his mother immediately and puts him in the orphanage . 
   a homophobic culture in western word does have some of its bases in judeo-christian beliefs even when one does not believe in god . 
  idk if you can call modern western world ` homophobic culture ' . 
  in fact it 's the most tolerant culture ever . 
  and judeo-christian beliefs may seem as a base for homophobia when you look at europe , but in global scale christian ( especially western christian ) societes are the * least * homophobic [ see : nice map linked in this thread ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/08/lgbt-tolerance-map2.jpg ),

   i know we are all in favour of same sex marriage here in / r/europe how so ? 
   assume that same sex marriage is legal in a country . 
  when christians want to get married there are 2 steps , one is for the state to recognise the marriage , the other is for a priest to recognise the marriage so that the couple are married `` under the eyes of god '' . 
  you do n't need a priest for a marriage to be recognised by god . 
  it 's just a tradition . 
  btw . 
  imo existence of a thing called ` state marriage ' is a nonsense . 
   if two gay christians want to get married then they get the state side done fine but may find a priest refusing to wed them . 
  i assume you mean catholic christians ? 
  some protestant churches allow for gay marriage already . 
   should the priest have the right to deny wedding them in god 's eyes ? 
  yes . 
  that is elementary freedom . 
  you should n't force people ( and gods ) to do what they believe is morally wrong . 
   i wonder if this comes under discrimination in countries with same sex marriage . 
  no , how could you call this discrimination ?
