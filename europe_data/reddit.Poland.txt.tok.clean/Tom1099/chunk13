  i do n't think so . 
  it 's not even about access to strategic facilities , but about the more basic stuff like e.g. 
  black boxes . 
  let 's compare the smolensk tragedy to mh17 shootdown . 
  ukrainian authorities and pro-russian rebels were able to hand over the black boxes of mh17 flight to the uk in * a week * , even though the boxes in a freaking war zone !, 
  [ ( source 2 ) ] ( http://mashable.com/2014/07/23/mh17-cockpit-voice-recorder-black-box/ ) yet polish fm * still acted as russia was a very friendly state * , instead of taking more serious stance - see source 1 . 
  imo putin very cleverly used the crash to divide polish society and political scene . 
  divide et impera . 
  had the polish government handled it better we might have not fell for it . 
   in out case it would be better if president would not be backed by political party or would be vote by parliament ( is n't slovakia doing that ? ), 
  president is by definition a politician . 
  you only have apolitical head of states in monarchies but then you ca n't give them any power ( democracy ) . 
  i do n't know anything better , this was just informative post . 
  wikipedia comes to mind as they have strict npov policy but they do n't have articles about all the candidates . 
  i always support the member parties of the alde so i never have anyone to vote for in poland 's elections :( which is weird becuase most poles are pro-european and pro-free market but there 's no real party that would combine these things . 
  there 's new libertarian party , and nowadays they 're small , hopefully they 'll evolve into something sensible . 
  but it 's pretty hypocrytical for a candidate who all the time talks about dialogue and accordance not to agree for a debate . 
  on the other hand kaczynski correctly judged russian foreign policy while komorowski & co. fucked up smolensk investigation by assuming russia is a trustworthy partner and thus contributing to a national divide . 
  nowadays it 's impossible for po and pis to cooperate in anything . 
  and you say kaczynski got into cock-measuring contest but tusk also did n't back down . 
  one of things president needs to do is to control what law is passed and komorowski signs without reading everything that comes from sejm . 
  sadly , the article linked is imho biased and badly written . 
  firstly , it lacks politicians ' stances on foreign issues , which is like one of the most important things to care about for president . 
  there are also a few bits that made me raise my eyebrow , let me quote them :  andrzej duda  key points : likely to be the favourite in krak\u00f3w , because of his family 's strong position in the city . 
  duda is the son-in-law of poet julian kornhauser . 
  i never heard about his family connections , and i believe most people who are going to vote for him did n't . 
  and krakow makes up like 2 % of polish population , so why is it the most important fact about duda ? 
  that 's arguable , but he describes himself as one , so let 's say it 's ok .  chances : almost certain to go to a second round run-off with opposition candidate andrzej duda . 
  his support has so far been highest of all the candidates , reaching 65 % in a january opinion poll . 
  ... and 38 % in may opinion poll , which is like nearly half of what he had in january . 
  that 's interesting fact imo . 
   janusz korwin-mikke  key points : maverick . 
  thrown out of his own former party ( new right congress ) when it emerged that he had fathered a child out of wedlock . 
  once protested against high taxes in poland by eating his tax return in public . 
  again , nothing about his foreign policy . 
  he 's the guy who openly supports russian propaganda by e.g. 
  saying that snipers who shooted people on euromaidan were trained in poland . 
   pawe\u0142 kukiz  chances : not as bad as might appear for an independent , and support is rising . 
  he scored 6 % in two april opinion polls , and may be the ` protest vote ' candidate of choice . 
  his poll high was actually yesterday , when he scored 17 % . 
  maybe in ten years time ... or maybe not . 
  wtf ? 
  also it should be noted , that he 's widely considered an unreliable candidate who very often changes his views . 
  he was a ` conservative right ' politician in the past , ` liberal right ' later to completely change his views and register his own ` liberal left ' party . 
  during that time he did n't achieve anything he promised his voters . 
   jacek wilk  there 's no room for ` people ' in his model . 
  wtf ? 
  in swedish deluge poland lost 1/3 of population, 
  * all * big polish parties have their roots in the communist regime ( sld , psl ) or in the old solidarity movement ( po , pis ) which gained power in aftermath of 1989 round table talks and a lot of current prominent politicians are now in mainstream politics for over 25 years ( including current opposition leaders kaczynski and miller who were sitting at the round table back in 1989 ) . 
  anti-establishment parties have no connection to the round table or were excluded from the talks . 
  idiotic idea . 
  it 's ridiculous that most politicians who say they are against current po-pis dual party system in poland support this . 
  their only argument is that politicians would need to be accountable to the voters , but it does n't work like that in reality . 
  single transferable vote would be the best imo , but no one even mentions it as an possibility . 
  edit : whole misconception lies in belief that mp has to represent some territory , while in times of globalisation , mobility , free market etc. 
  they should rather represent peoples ' political views . 
  surely . 
  you ca n't magically turn around a awful economy in 2 years . 
  it takes a lot longer . 
  but the thing is , it will actually start to ( relatively quickly ) improve , while it was in stagnation for the last * 25 years * - just look at [ this ] ( https://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2014/03/blogs/free-exchange/ukraine.jpg ) . 
  beltrum , the netherlands is 465 km away from london , paris and berlin, 
  gnome is actually * gnu network object model environment * :d but otherwise i agree, 
  \\  80 % of all driving is in the city , and there are `` supercharging '' stations ( or battery swap stations ) in cities and on major roads to provide you with power on the long trips ( i mean , there will be such stations in the future ) . 
  when you drive in a city you can charge at night in your garage or a parking lot near your house with charging station ( which will be there in the future ) . 
  you need to realise that charging evs wo n't happen the same way we use petrol stations today . 
  the point about tesla is that they think ahead - that 's why i bring up things that do n't exist yet as arguments . 
  long charging time and heavy batteries are the only disadvantages of electronic motors over combustion engines . 
  no noise , efficiency , environment , size , acceleration , no pollution , no wasting of fossil fuels - electric motors * are * better . 
  the only reason we use ice-cars today is because how shitty was battery technology back in the beginning of 20th century . 
  but the future belongs to electric motors and tesla very much realises that - and that 's why they get so much love . 
  i heard of concept one . 
  but for now they only made a few ( ~ 100 ? ), 
  super expensive super sports cars and there 's little to see but promotional leaflets . 
  when ( if they 're going to , idk ) they start making cars for the market and they will show themselves to be that good then more people will get interested . 
  lemkos from village of \u041b\u043e\u0441\u044f , today \u0141osie in little poland used to sell oil as a medicine . 
  they were also selling greases and other oily stuff . 
  how could they repeal laws that were already removed ? 
  as for the ministry of * information policy * - [ relevant / r/europe ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ps13v/ukraine_forms_ministry_of_truth_to_regulate_the/ ) thread . 
  these laws were removed even before the euromaidan . 
  ( january 31st ), 
  the stuff ukrainian people do is very strongly connected to european values . 
  the change in whole system is slow , but at least the direction is right . 
   not to mention this . 
  [ 2 ]   on the 57th day of ukraine 's massive pro-european , anti-government protests , the country 's parliament passed a law that limits freedom of assembly , restricts the country 's media and clamps down on freedom of expression . 
  did you actually read what you quoted ? 
  edit :  what #russia did in 60 days after putin 's inaug , #ukraine did in 20 minutes : `` foreign agents '' law , limits on demos , criminalz of libel , etc. 
  that quote is also from january . 
  edit 2 : the world press freedom index you referred to is from * may 2014 * . 
  in the [ source ] ( http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php# ) the only quote about ukraine is  from ukraine ( 127th , unchanged ) and azerbaijan ( 160th , -3 ) to central asia , russia 's repressive legislation and communications surveillance methods are happily copied . 
  which suggests that this research was also done before euromaidan . 
  or any european old town for that matter, 
  we may be homophobic , but we do not shout loud how disgusted we are by eu nazigayness, 
  havel was pretty good . 
  you ca n't have 6/6/5 ruler all the time . 
  putin is so awesome he gets two bars, 
  unless you are the aborted one . 
  the obvious fault in your argument is you do n't die because of removing the snot . 
   you 're writing as if the pro-abortion camp wants no limits all abortions legal up to the ninth month . 
  apparently i 'm blind . 
   on the other hand , the anti-abortion camp is the one that usually takes an extreme position , either no abortions ever or abortions only if the mother 's life is threatened .
