  if gay pair wants church marriage then they should n't be a gay pair in the first place . 
  seems you forgot about those who could n't defend the country in ww2 and commies appointed by soviets . 
  i 'd say bierut ( stalinism ) or jaruzelski ( martial law ) was the worst . 
  fun fact : belsat ( from belarus ) is financed and coproduced by polish television and polish mfa . 
  it 's not too secret , is it ? 
  that explains a lot . 
   if it was 2mm wide , then 0.3 mm 's a bit more understandable to complain about . 
  2mm width of anything in newspaper is ridiculous . 
  you would barely distinguish eu flag from blue box . 
  it 's ridiculous to assume someone would actually measure the flag in local newspaper with 0.3 mm accuracy ( ! ), 
  maybe he had just enough space for minimum required logo or something . 
  we 're talking about so small error that even if the guy measured the flag in test print with ruler he might have not noticed it . 
  and 30 000 $ punishment for such thing , that will be paid by local community , not by the guy who did it ... 
  it makes eu look like it wanted not to develop europe , but to promote itself with lowest possible costs . 
  why european tv channels block viewers from other eu countries ? 
  is n't this breaking non-discrimination rule ? 
  except for those countries which westernized in the meantime :p, 
  well , who could memorise names of all those ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ allformer3 polish fiefs anyway ... 
  our country too promised help for apple producers . 
   the day poland does something for us , we 'll do something for them [ lol ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_african_republic_conflict_%282012%e2%80%93present%29 ) ( i do n't want to mention what happened under napoleon )  we have an industry to run , and it 's always the same countries who must shoot their economy in the head for the sake of `` allies '' . 
  guess which countries lost most on sanctions ? 
  meanwhile in poland : public opinion : why does n't us treat as like partners ? 
  why are we the last country in eu whose citizens need visa to get to us ? 
  why do we need to be first to fight in every single us war ? 
  polish politicans : shhh , or we wo n't get that promised missile defence shield !, 
  us : lol , what defence shield ? 
  but they 're not ( at least not all of them ) . 
  as long as english students will be paying for it , right ? 
  going away from russia may help ( see : georgia ), 
  no family = no kids, 
  football is still more popular but more and more people seem to `` move '' to volleyball . 
  it 's played in all schools and polish team is ~ ~ among ~ ~ world 's best, 
  you have nice parent groups there then . 
  `` our kid watches bad websites on its mobile !, 
  should we talk with him about it ? '', 
  `` no , let 's lobby phone companies for ( opt-out ) censorship instead ! '', 
  i commented on  the idea which is  self-propagation [ of eu ] not visitor centre itself . 
  i ment things like `` millions of europeans stronger together with the euro '', 
  yeah , but they do n't look nice either . 
  i ment main symbol does n't need to be architecture, 
  if there were a referendum on e.g. 
  ttip would you vote ? 
  citizens should not leave all the power to a few . 
  today we can affect eu policy basically only be euparl elections , but , in poland at least , ttip , or how eu funds are spent were n't mentioned at all by politicians in their campaigns . 
  do n't get angry . 
  your country benefits from eu aswell . 
  there are always things we can improve , so why not ? 
  now it 's not about ads but generally about eu going in not-so-democratic direction, 
  noone ever asked wheter people want that much of ` public service advertising ' in their homes, 
  sorry , but could you explain what you ment ? 
  the idea is very old . 
  it 's called propaganda . 
  but this does n't answer the question : /, 
  imo they shoudl n't have been looking so necessarily for the pieces of architecture , but rather allow something more creative or abstract, 
   eu spends money on outreach and informative publications what about two-way communication ? 
  how would you knowit was real if it were n't for a guy on his first date ? 
  how would you know eu takes care of your roots if it were n't for this [ ad of agriculture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4xmydypawk ) ? 
  btw . 
  in poland we had recently a nice campaingn about new z\u0142oty banknotes . 
  informative and without unnecessary propaganda . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vpsx_p-ohe ), 
  nice username, 
  as is st petersburg, 
  no offence to cardiff , but what 's wrong with baku ? 
  just wait one year until next elections when conservatives will probably win . 
  they hate russia . 
  it 's something that should be left for member states . 
  aside from map : `` supported by progress programme of european union '' - lgbt affairs are not thing i 'd like the eu to be taking care of , even if it were to become european federation . 
  not my country , but : [ \u00c9lie hoarau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lie_hoarau ) and [ paul verg\u00e8s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_verg%c3%a8s ) communist party of reunion in european parliament . 
  seriously . 
  white-red-white is based on the coat of arms ( pahonia ; the one similar to lithuanian one , showing connection to grand duchy of lithuania ; it 's banned now aswell ) ; red-green flag is a variation on old belarus soviet republic 's flag , used since '95 referendum . 
  the people who voted on keeping wrw are kind of like western ukrainians and those who wanted soviet one back are kinda like people in eastern ukraine ( homo sovieticus ), 
   and by `` share of the assets '' he specifically means a currency union . 
  which is complete crap considering the currency union does n't even exist , it 's an idea . 
  do n't scots use pounds ? 
  and taxes they pay are spent on uk 's national debt . 
  so imo it does n't sound that ridiculous . 
  and if scotlands joins the eu ( or stays in eu ) then they 'll probably adopt $ sooner or later . 
  you speak as if russia cared about proofs . 
  thanks for nice discussion tho, 
  i mean , they will recover from the crisis . 
  actually , the recovery has started . 
   like a collapse in the bond market caused by a simultaneous default of portugal + italy +2 / 3 eastern eu countries + russia + shortly after the us due to an extreme devaluation of the usd ? 
  yeah , that 's kind of what i do n't expect to happen . 
   but that still meant we had to save loads and loads of cash to fund them . 
  we wo n't be feeding them for ever . 
   think of it as a personnal bet . 
  i heard echos of high level talks suggesting that portugal is frauding just as much as greece was and could cause a domino effect too . 
  ok , i were n't following it closely lately , so i wo n't deny . 
  i 'll look into it . 
  6000 $ / capita in poland seems to make sense and matches other `` debt clocks '' here, 
   you seems quite sure of yourself . 
  and you say this based on ... ? 
  because i live in one of poorer regions of eu and see what 's going on . 
  and i do n't see any economic catastrophe coming that would suddenly cause all people lose their jobs . 
   i see that some high class european are still living in their bubble . 
  i suggest you visit greece one of those days . 
  ah , greece . 
  i hope they get their shit together . 
  crisises end .
