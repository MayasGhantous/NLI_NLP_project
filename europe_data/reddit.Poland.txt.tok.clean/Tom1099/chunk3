  be it with eu intervention or with market force . 
  unemployment is falling now ( or stopped raising ) , gdp stopped falling . 
  they are still relatively wealthy , so they will recover , maybe with a lesson for future . 
   not really . 
  everything we are saving will go toward avoiding the flash crash that might happens at the beggining of next year ( january/mars ) . 
  and it might still be barely enough . 
  expect potential new greece-like direct intervention in the eu . 
  are you an economist or did you read it somewhere ? 
  if the second , can you please link ? 
  i 'd be happy to learn more about this . 
   it means 35 % of the system is hanging by a hairwidth thread . 
  does n't that worries you just a bit ? 
  firstyl , 120 mln people is 25 % . 
  secondly , most of these people wo n't `` fall '' into `` poor '' category , especially when we start recovery from the crisis ( unless war breaks ) . 
  you wo n't say that every forth man you know barely manages to not become poor . 
   maybe , but it 's not our job to police the entire planet . 
  let the americans do that . 
  just our sphere of influence . 
  we are wealthy enough to help the rest of planet just a bit now , and more in the future . 
  it sounds huge ( 120 mln people is more than whole eastern part of eu ) , but you should n't confuse `` being at risk of '' with actually being poor or social excluded . 
  if you read the website , you see that , e.g. 
  10 % of europeans live in households without anyone with job - it 's 50 million people , way less than 120 mln , and many of them get state help or work on black market . 
  on the other hand 450 mln ( 90 % ) live in households where at least one person legally works . 
  17 % live on less than 60 % of average household income , but average income is always significantly more than median . 
  and the part about severe material deprivation sounds overestimated , since i live in one of poorest regions of eu but i do n't see people unable to heat their homes too much , except maybe for those who choose themselves to spend all their money on alcohols . 
  i believe that many people outside of eu would be happy to be `` at risk of poverty in eu '' , and those are people who really need help . 
  btw . 
   ** the best ** reduced the risk of poverty by ** 35 % ** , the least effective by less than 15 % ( eu ** average 35 % ** ), 
  notice minus, 
   russian tv channels are broadcasted in belarus and ukrainian are n't , so most people think kiev is more responsible then moscow , hence support russians . 
  a propos : i know there 's our little propaganda tv in belarus ( belsat ) . 
  can you say , how many people in belarus watch that actually ? 
  how many support opposition ? 
  as if poland was n't in europe, 
  eastern europe dictators were backed by external power ( russia ) . 
  russian dictator is backed by russians , unfortunately . 
  i think ` you need religion to be moral ' is not what 3dom ment ... 
   also nobody notes ( or has any sense to understand ) that the molotov-ribbentrop pact and soviet union 's invasion of finland were measures to protect itself from nazi germany 's blitzkrieg because having a potential ally to the west does n't protect from german blitzkrieg, 
   needs a buffer zone . 
  i hate this expression so much . 
  19th-century thinking . 
  poor superpower russia needs protection from nato . 
  as if nato was an aggressive coalition of countries hungry for lebensraum . 
  the thing is , people in western countries realised in 20th century that `` buffer zones '' are habitated lands with real people who live there and suffer because of people like putin and their imperialistic aspirations . 
  hopefuly russia will grow up to this sometime in the future, 
  afaik l' here should be read as normal l , t ' a similar to ` tya ' / ` tia ', 
  nicaragua and costa rica have border dispute ( nicaragua invaded uninhabited costarican island recently ) , so they always vote opposite, 
  is having hands up while still holding anything signal of surrender ? 
  according to wiki , it 's not, 
   for not being reputable . 
  ~ ~ after seeing tonnes of shit on / r/mapporn i now honestly surprised . 
  maybe something starts to change . 
  good . ~ ~ edit : i just realised it was deleted from r/europe . 
  nevermind . 
   the problem here is that they were n't allowed by law to serve the coffee like that . 
  that 's the point , we discuss here if it 's stupid law or not . 
   first of all , coffee should be served drinkable . 
  the market decides how it 's served . 
  maybe people want coffee that wo n't get cold after a while . 
   it was an accident . 
  shit happens . 
   would you like to have a look at her burns ? 
  ( possibly nsfw ) no , thank you, 
  omg then why did she spilled the coffee on herself ??? 
  if you make coffee at home and spill boiling water on yourself you do n't sue kettle producer , it 's absurd normal people learn to be cautious with fire and boiling water in childhood, 
  instructions on using ladder is an effect of regulations , not direct product of ep . 
  ban is on selling of a substantion produced while smoking meats , not smoking itself . 
  big difference , really, 
  most of my claims do n't appear there , and note about pigs is 11 yrs old . 
   yeah , because states ' administrations are so `` effective '' states ' administartions do n't have to deal with other states when legislating  1 mln signatures is proportionally much less than 100.000 in poland but in reality a lot harder to gather in 12 months . 
   yeah , like it 's not the case with sovereign states . 
  the difference is that without eu ( or feredal euorpe ) we 'd have 28 stupid laws instead of one in some states there would n't be those stupid laws , in eu they must enforce them . 
  ok , then federation more like switzerland than like eu v2, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liebeck_v._mcdonald%27s_restaurants#references ), 
   the ** temperature ** of their ** hot ** drinks from wiki :  though ** there was a warning on the coffee cup ** , the jury decided that the warning was neither large enough nor sufficient . 
  i was wrong , she might have known coffee might be hot  liebeck 's attorneys discovered that mcdonald 's required franchisees to hold coffee at 180 -- 190 \u00b0 f ( 82 -- 88 \u00b0 c ) . 
  i believe we deal with higher temperatures at home . 
  brb , suing kettle producer . 
  edit :  you 're a moron :(, 
  if it 's going to be similar to current eu , but having more power i 'm against it . 
  if it 's going to be more like a confederation with more direct democracy , many aspects left for states , then i might be ok with this . 
  and then effective and efficient translate both to ... `` wydajny '' :d, 
   that 's a substance many people are highly allergic to . 
  i believe those people do n't buy products with cinnamon . 
   not true , there are limits on artificial smoke additives . 
  you can smoke to your heart 's content , but situation changes when you try to sell it . 
  ban is on a substantion that is produced while smoking meats using traditional methods , used by small companies . 
  big companies are unaffected . 
   eu tried to enforce ban on skewed bananas . 
   fake 1994-2009  humane treatment of animals is stupid for you ? 
  no , but this law was designed so pigs wo n't harm others . 
  instead of having farmer to ensure pigs are secured , it tells him what to do exactly . 
  too much of a specialisation , if you ask me . 
   that 's not even an eu regulation . 
  it 's been put by the producers who want to weasel out of warranty requirements ( which are , ironically , enforced by eu ) - if you use it contrary to instruction , they 're not responsible for any damage . 
  if someone do n't know how tu use a ladder he must be an idiot . 
  if we must write laws that provides for all possible situations we 'll sink in papers . 
  with this attitude soon we 'll become 2nd america were women got compensation from restaurant because she did n't know coffe might be hot ( ! ), 
   that is my problem with eu - instead of protecting the important culturally product , it only forces the knock-offs to change the name . 
   and the less influence it has on the international stage .
