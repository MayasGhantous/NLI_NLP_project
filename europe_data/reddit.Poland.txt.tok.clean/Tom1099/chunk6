  speak for yourself . 
  my country borders russia . 
  imo there should be no state marriages at all . 
  what 's the reason for having them ? 
  in poland church was actively helping the cause of `` solidarity '', 
  dae notice , this law passed along with some changes in judical system ? 
  seems that the homomarriage thing is like something in poland called `` supervisor subject '' - something controversial to hide other important reforms . 
  i 'd be more happy if they have the balls to stand up to russia now . 
  so , any recent american and european manned missions do n't count either ? 
  afaik it 's lithuanian coat of arms since , hm , time immemorial . 
  used by lithuanian princes even before christianisation, 
  it was state founded by lithuanians , but most people spoke ruthenian and most nobles spoke polish ( ethnically being lithuanian or ruthenian though ) . 
  it 's nothing ashaming though , e.g. 
  in poland most people in cities spoke german  the name `` lithuania '' itself used to refer to belarus aswell as lithuania . 
  did you read a history book about lenin ( marxism - * leninism * ) ? 
  did you notice that marsnobu talked not about marx himself , but marxism-leninism in general ? 
  marx might have been just a philosopher i do n't agree with , but leninism with its revolution of proletariate is dangerous and * very * radical . 
  and do you really think most europeans agree with concept of `` class struggle '' or other views of marx ? 
  those are some ideas of the most radical far-left parties , but they somehow do n't make up 50 % of ep . 
  there 's something that makes me very critical to any sort of communism or other radical ideologies : history . 
  this just do n't end up well . 
  unfortunately , there 's plenty of people who still argue , * their * version of it is good , leninism had some errors that wo n't be repeated this time etc. 
  what about name ? 
  modern day belarus was in the past called just lithuania ( like in polish national poem , the beginning is `` lithuania , my fatherland '' , while action takes place in belarus ) . 
  my hope would be they joining alde , so we would have at least one party there , but it seems unreal . 
  imo they will join other eurosceptics . 
  and of course media will all the time rant `` look !, 
  knp is with anti-polish ukip ( or any other west euroscpetic party ) ! '', 
  and knp will be saying : `` if we were brits we would be anti-polish too , they are actually right about polish immigrants ! '', 
  are you wyborcza reader ? 
   they claim that democracy is the worst thing to have happened to poland . 
  their leader claims that . 
   calling disabled people idiots , false : comparing paralympic to chess competition for idiots - yes . 
   saying that women should be posesion of their husbands false . 
  wtf  he should become a king false . 
  he is for restoring monarchy though . 
   and , the topping on the cake , saying that molestation of young girls is actually a positive phenomenon because it makes them more attractive in the future . 
  if it werent for that he knew soviets would not invade ... 
  he got an order from moscow to `` solve the problem on his own '', 
  or the mep who won internal party elections bribing his colleagues with seats in public company ? 
  the govt reaction was basically `` nothing to see here '' . 
  ( he 's the same guy from `` neo-nazi '' scandal on german airport ) . 
  5 % of voters . 
  always . 
  one guy being ok does n't mean govt is ok . 
  regrettable the whole govt were so pro-russian for all that time , and now use him to improve public view on their foreign policy . 
  there are problems with it in current system , but modern cryptography gives a huge number of possibilities , i can imagine a complete anonymity voting system , where from citizen 's public id numbers ( `` addresses '' , `` keys '' whatever ) and random numbers a program ( `` contract '' ) working in p2p network [ generates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diffie%e2%80%93hellman_key_exchange ) `` public keys '' and then publishes list of random numbers used ( maybe encrypted with citizen 's public id number ) . 
  voters ' program have private id number and generates `` private keys '' for each number on the list . 
  and when it founds the right one , magic of mathematics makes it possible to him to digitally sign his vote , without anyone knowing who he is . 
  other cryptographic techniques can make it more secure ( like e.g. 
  2 factor authentication ) . 
  that 's something i just came out with , but i think there is * a lot * more ways to do it . 
  [ i know one actual initiative trying to put something like that in life ] ( http://www.bitcongress.org/ ) . 
  i think all slavic languages have much vocabulary , but russian is unique in its way of deriverating basic words from roots . 
  see : `` spasiba '' - it comes from `` save us god '' ( spasi bog ) , when other slavs use `` dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 '' ( pl ) , `` dyakuyu '' ( ua ) `` dekuji '' ( cz ) etc. 
  or `` hvala '' ( south slavs ) ; or `` zdrastvujtie '' ( `` be well '' ) - all other use `` good day '' or `` day good '' : `` dzie\u0144 dobry '' , `` dobryj den ' '' , etc. 
  imo in poland education on other countries of europe is pretty ok , idk about yours . 
  but to me , it is important because history determines present , and we should have some knowledge in this to understand people in other parts of world and processes that happen now . 
  but not to create ` european identity ' - we are diverse and let it stay like that, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://i.imgur.com/usdvaal.png ) i 've actually used the similar gradient as in original but with natural order of colours , and had to make some arbitrary changes because our eyes dont ' distinguish green and blue colours as much as yellow/red . 
  thanks for suggestions, 
  [ better ? 
  but certainly more similar than srbian or russian , and if you know a bit of another slavic language it is imo really easier to understand than czech, 
  iirc med\u017cuslovjanski was created because slovio was too russian-influenced . 
  russians have much vocabulary not understood by most slavs so it can be a problem . 
  and ` medu ' is `` mi\u0119dzy '' in polish , 
  basing on wikipedia info and [ this ] ( http://www.vvk.ee/public/dok/internet_voting_in_estonia.pdf ) , voters encrypt their votes with state public key and sign their votes digitally using smart id card , and they can vote as many times as possible . 
  the last vote coming to the server counts . 
  so it seems they have to trust their government that they really remove signatures before sending votes to the election committee . 
  if one does n't trust he can vote at polling station and by doing that cancels his vote . 
  one of solutions to the privacy problem could be using cryptocurrency p2p network , where anonymity can be guaranteed . 
  technically it 's possible today , so hopefully we may see it soon . 
  i can speak english so language is not a problem for me , and it 's an internet service . 
  i do n't see why i could n't use it like uk citizen . 
  but i ca n't and it 's not available here , even though we call eu `` common market '' . 
  eli5 : why netflix launches in germany , austria , switzerland , france , belgium and luxembourg instead of launching in european union ? 
  can you use this system to other things , like citizen 's initiative ? 
  why ca n't you vote for candidates from other regions ? 
  god is serb and he cares about his country , do n't you know that ? 
  have you seen a gay parade in arab country ? 
  no wonder why there are deserts there !, 
  privatisation of what ? 
  eu does n't have any factories . 
  i ment things like strict regulations on production of some products . 
  for example : highlanders in poland who were making `` oscypek `` s for hundreds years must now pay 1000 z\u0142 ( 250 $ ) yearly to get certificate allowing them to sell `` oscypek `` s. recently there were news about proposed restrictions on smoking meats in wooden owens . 
  the current form . 
  before further integration i 'd like to see less bearocracy , propaganda and intervention in market , more democracy ( incl . 
  direct democracy ) and efficiency . 
  i would see eu in the future as kind of confederacy , with free market and more power in the hands of people . 
  certainly not `` usoe '' . 
  maybe yes , but it depends on how it will be directed . 
  with rising euroscepticism some serious changes should be done soon . 
  hopefully eastern regions will develop enough to not be seen as a burden for western ( im ' looking at you , uk ) and efficiency and economic policies will be improved so it will be possible to go further . 
  for example : cost of moving ep to strasbourg and back to brussels - 250 mln $ yearly . 
  6 % of eu budget is still 1 percent point more than eu invests in research or half the funding of nasa ( to put it into perspective ) . 
  there are reports on abnormalities and corruption in financing european parliament . 
  so imo that 's one of the things that need to be improved . 
  have you heard of any optimisation of eu institutions in last 10 years ? 
  i have never seen a single mep or mep candidate who would say a word about it ( not surprising given that e.g. 
  in poland ep campaign focuses on scarring people with other candidates ),
