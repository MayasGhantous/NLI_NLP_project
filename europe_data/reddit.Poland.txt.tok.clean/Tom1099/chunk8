  one , free market ( but really one , not like today when some services are available only in chosen countries etc. ), 
  and simple tax rules ( precise levels to be set by nations/lower adm. structures ) , one currency , common foreign affairs . 
  energy union , military alliance . 
  we are europeans after all and should cooperate . 
  more direct or liquid democracy and decentralization , 4 . 
  name : `` european union '' . 
  why change ? 
  it 'd be fine if it were n't for all that communists . 
  it ruins the effect . 
  were n't there other occasions ? 
  when you want to name polygon or other stuff it gets into one word , 
  well , polish is in fact very logical compared to the rest of languages , when it comes to numbers . 
  we have words for number 0-10 and for powers of 10s , and bind them together in descending order . 
  so it 's 999-gon . 
  between 3 and 4 . 
  imo it would be best to turn national states in something like switzerland cantons ( strong decentralization and liquid/direct democracy , free market ) , but maybe without neutrality in foreign affairs , and with guaranting nations right to secede or opt out from some parts of the union . 
  on the other hand , almost all slavic people can communicate with each other without learning any foreign language . 
  there 's even an artifical language called [ slovianski ] ( http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/ ) , that can be understood by any slav with no problems . 
  btw . 
  you were talking about rusyn or what dialect ? 
  it does n't work if you are talking with an imperialist trying to rebuild the russian empire . 
   strong economic sanctions will hurt europe 's economy almost as much as russia 's . 
  eu 's trade with russia is ~ 10 % of all eu trade and ~ 50 % of all russian trade ( mostly natural resources ) . 
  if we achieve energy union or will somehow become independent energetically from russia we could easily make economic pressure on them . 
   imho we need a more productive , a diplomatic approach to solve this crisis . 
  if not economic sanctions , then what ? 
  same in poland . 
  imo , in eu elections votes should go on european parties instead of national . 
  now it looks like a parody of national parliamentary elections . 
  the problem is , they are the biggest left-wing party in poland and have almost 10 % of seats in parliament . 
  so , do n't be surprised with high support for right-wing here :d, 
  today headlines : `` germans were sponsoring pm 's party '' - says europa + candidate . 
  earlier for example : `` i do n't give a shit about crimea nor politics . 
  if you too , vote for me '' ; `` gotham has batman , poland has hartman . 
  the best candidate in cracow '' ; `` i always have as much support in elections as waist circumference . 
  now i 'm even fatter . 
  i will win '', 
  i bet it would be the same if it were n't for `` europa + your move '' 's ridiculous campaign . 
  other parties initially acted as it were national elections , but now even them seem to loose interest . 
  imo , that 's because poles ( or polish media ) seem to be not interested in european politics at all . 
  things like ` net neutrality ' and such are rarely mentioned in mass media . 
  turkic language , history , 95 % of the population are muslims , strong persian influence , cultural heritage has strong ties with muslim world . 
  seems it 's culture is a mix of west and east . 
  i 'd say there 's more east of it , but it is really difficult to put a clear border between civilisations really . 
  anyway , if i 'd have to say where europe ends and asia begins i would include azerbaijan in asia . 
  btw . 
  soviets influenced culture of conquered conutries , but did n't destroy it . 
  georgia and armenia are culturally european . 
  very distinct from asian azarbaijan . 
  our history books also focus on all those wars and such , but it 's squabbling between eastern european realms ( germany , poland , czech , hungary , muscovy , lithuania , turkey , ** kievan rus ** ) . 
  ukrainian culture is definetely european , and appearance in western history courses has nothing to do with it . 
  how often austria is mentioned in portugal history books ? 
  fun fact 2 : [ flag of bohemia and old flag of czechoslovakia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/flag_of_bohemia.svg/220px-flag_of_bohemia.svg.png ) . 
  [ flag of poland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/flag_of_poland.svg/240px-flag_of_poland.svg.png ) . 
  and there would be gigantic german empire ? 
  no thanks . 
  no wwii , weaker soviet union , but also continued kulturkampf , no liberation of central european nations , no developing of democracy and integration in europe . 
  also , i doubt french and russian together would n't be able to challenge germany , especially because germany would be made in large part from not-german territories , whose inhabitants did n't like their rulers . 
  to me it looks like an opposite . 
  what 's wrong with old couple going through the street , children with ice-cream , man enjoying coffee , and plenty of pretty girls ? 
  there are a few photos from dirty places , a few photos of romas , but imo they are well balanced by other pictures . 
  thanks !, 
  the biggest issue imo is that the current way it works is a. complicated b. undemocratic . 
  there is plenty of institutions that correlate with each other in some ways but try to find a european who would know how . 
  the only way he can influence european politics more directly than in local elections of head of state is to vote in ep elections , which are some weird copy of local elections ( no party in poland is actually talking what they will do in ep , president of the 2nd biggest proposes debate about ... healthcare - sic ) , it 's very difficult to find out what the parties do when they are in ep , and people are not infromed what is going on there ( no word about net neutrality in polish media ) , instead ads of european funds ( i do n't see what 's it purpose ) are everywhere . 
  how can more integration be expected if people are discouraged to participate in european affairs ? 
  btw . 
  what fraction in ep is most liberal/libertarian/democratic ? 
  i do n't know and it 's not so easy to find out . 
  and even if i find out it may probably have no candidates in my country . 
  sad . 
  usually only about 2 % of workers are paid minimum wage , i do n't know why it is so important for left-wing . 
  `` workers ' dignity is back '' - what has minimum wage to do with workers dignity ? 
  gas does n't contribute more to global warming , it is made from coal ( gives co2 when burns ) and hydrogen ( gives water when burns ) , while coal is made from , guess what , coal only . 
  [ economic development ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_development ) in statistics i provided you there is shown level of economic freedom . 
  gdp , hdi and history of these countries are easily findable in the internet . 
  read about chile , estonia , botswana . 
  i give you examples of capitalism in work , rather than discussing theoritically . 
  well , click on the [ interactive heat map ] ( http://www.heritage.org/index/heatmap ) and tell me , would you choose to live in a red or green contry ? 
  belarus flag is best !, 
  sorry , [ link ] ( http://www.heritage.org/index ) . 
   are you going to complete that sentence ? 
  capitalism  socialism , if there is n't an super extraordinary situation . 
  socialism is not a legitimate alternative . 
  we had experiment of soviet revolution , we had experiment of the third way in africa , and we had western countries with capitalisms ( even if they were welfare states - still more capitalist than what soviets had ) . 
  now we can look at history and derivate conclusions . 
  even nowadays , you can argue that venezuela fought poverty , but it 's a country with enormous amounts of oil . 
  such estonia does not have natural resources , yet in 20 years after the fall of soviet union it 's one of the most developed countries east of oder . 
  why ? 
  because of economic freedom . 
  based on 2014 index of economic freedom by the heritage foundation and wall street journal , aswell as observations of development of my country . 
  the welfare states of europe started as capitalisms , when they had biggest economic growths . 
  the welfare states were built later , when those countries were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of economic progress . 
  also welfare state is not equal with socialism . 
  in most of european countries the markets are regulated by taxes rather than subsidies , and state is not actively intervening , if nothing wrong happens . 
  btw compare western block and soviet block during the cold war . 
   they do n't want us to believe that socialism is a legitimate alternative . 
  it is n't . 
  you do n't always have some hugo chavez or someone who will take care of the country and lead it cleverly . 
  there were plenty of socialisms in the world , yet i ca n't remember any that could be called ` succesful ' - even venesuelian one is disputable .
