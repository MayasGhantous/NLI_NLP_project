i delisted this submission because it is a low quality content . 
  it 's not . 
  wow , this skyline looks amazing !, 
  where is it ? 
  that looks great , pity i could n't watch it in person , thanks for sharing !, 
  it is , apart from some circumstances . 
  i just thought it was n't just poland that had abortion law this way . 
  how do you mean ? 
  i had no idea we differ that much on this matter . 
  i ca n't stand how they feel entitled to dictate us what we should do . 
  especially when it comes to these disgusting monuments that should 've been all destroyed years ago . 
  it was sad when i found out that a part of 200 syrians , who were brought here ( by a foundation ) and given apartments and money for living , just left . 
  aside from wwii , sometimes there are issues like cooperating with russia ( nordstream ) , being against nato bases to be located in poland , criticising rota melody being played in gda\u0144sk or articles with `` polish death camps '' . 
  quite exaggerated with that music and posing with sunglasses but the message should spread !, 
  i 'm surprised with usa having 37 % / 23 % ( unacceptable / acceptable ) . 
  unfortunately people often view english names as more cool . 
  `` i\u015b\u0107 tam , gdzie kr\u00f3l chodzi piechot\u0105 '' ( to go where the king goes by foot . ), 
  - to go to the toilet . 
  `` kopn\u0105\u0107 w kalendarz '' ( to kick the calendar ) - to die . 
  `` w stroju adama '' ( in adam 's outfit ) - naked . 
  `` mie\u0107 \u017c\u00f3\u0142te papiery '' ( to have yellow papers ) - to be mentally ill . `` cztery litery '' ( four letters ) - ass .

  in general i guess it might be `` do boju ! '', 
  ( `` to the fight !, 
  ( `` for poland ! '' ), 
  ( `` poland is not yet lost ! '' ) . 
  and against communists it 'd be `` raz sierpem , raz m\u0142otem czerwon\u0105 cho\u0142ot\u0119 ! '', 
  which means `` once with sickle , once with hammer , this red trash !, 
  there are also nice songs like : * [ idzie \u017co\u0142nierz borem lasem ( `` soldier walking through the forests '' ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedubvmyeek ) .

   i do n't think it 's fair to assign motive to people out of a few minutes of video i do n't do that . 
  my comments are based on all what i saw . 
   i was just pointing out other perspectives that could cause the same reaction what can be other reason if not demand to go to germany or sweden ? 
   they were tossing the food as well . 
  i think hungarians thought of what food they should give . 
  besides if it was about halal , the immigrants would take water . 
   but they can use video like this to paint them as economic migrants actually when they refuse to stay in a safe country what else would u call them ? 
   `` we need to keep the migrants out , let 's build a wall ! '', 
  walls would be useful . 
  there would be much more control over the situation . 
  unfortunately they wo n't build walls on the shores in italy or greece . 
   possibly , but i 've never seen other video or pictures with people doing this . 
  it 's also a cultural thing : middle easterners are picky about being `` clean '' . 
  that 's why calling someone a dog or showing them the bottom of your feet is an insult there . 
  it does n't need to be a standard . 
  just someone decided to do that for caution . 
  caution is more important than cultural things . 
  i guess calling someone a dog is an insult to ( almost ) all people . 
  also have you seen someone showing the bottom of their foot to the immigrants ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  these things have no relation to the topic . 
   so when a middle easterner goes somewhere where they are treated as unclean , it could be considered a giant `` fuck you '' . 
  when you are at an airport and the security checks you , do you consider it `` fuck you '' ? 
  or when they can watch you with street cameras ? 
  it 's the same way of thinking . 
  according to it this would be treating you as a criminal . 
  it 's hard to imagine being a refugee when you 're safe and have a normal life . 
  i 'm totally sure it 'd be an extremely hard thing to go through . 
  still , people in the video show no respect . 
  if i needed help how could i expect someone to do something for me when i did n't respect them ? 
  if i was running away from a country in war , how could i ** demand ** something more than offering me a safe stay in a safe country ? 
  that 's unthinkable to me . 
   it 's highly likely they tossed the food because it was n't halal since when water is halal ? 
   `` see ? 
  they 're ungrateful or are here just to take jobs . 
  we have to send them back ! '', 
  they ca n't send ** refugees ** back because of the law . 
  the problem is the people who are coming , do n't want to stay . 
   even the masks they wear while trying to distribute food could be seen as an insult by the people there because it implies that they are dirty and diseased . 
  maybe they are diseased ? 
  i guess it may be easy to get a disease during such a long and dangerous journey they go through . 
   we are literally just guessing at their motives they just do n't want to register in hungary , they want to go to germany . 
  which is against law . 
  that 's terrible , i wish those bastards backed off finally . . 
  thank you for the group 's and the song 's name , i really like it . 
  i know that you had conflicts with russia ( or you still have some ? ) . 
  you like our former president lech kaczy\u0144ski and you have an interestingly looking alphabet . 
  also i came across a [ song ] ( http://www.cda.pl/video/143324ed ) which is labeled as georgian . 
  i 'd appreciate you telling me the title if you know it , 
  first thought : `` why the f *** is poland not listed ? 
  '' , then a quick glance at the year range . 
  `` oh . . that 's why . . '' ; _ ;, 
  looks beautiful !, 
   northern baltic states like latvia , estonia , ** slovenia and slovakia ** seriously . . ? 
   nab\u011bra\u010dka luv your language :d, 
   decides the fundamentalists in the gothenburg ghetto are somehow the `` true face '' of islam i guess she just followed people of her nationality , joined the community . 
   then she converts to christianity ( because that 's all butterflies and love ) of course it 's not all butterflies and love but it was something very different to her so i can understand why she was all for it . 
   and now ( and i quote  wants to `` rescue muslims with the truth '' she wants to show other women that they have a choice . 
  what is wrong with that ? 
   if i was muslim , i 'd punch that woman . 
  now you 're borderline retarded . 
   i am all for reducing religious influence on public life totally agree . 
   they are more involved ( they are neighbour ) i think you should look at a map . 
  [ about mona walter in english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4q8bimipcm ), 
   ( khm poland khm ) elaborate . 
  you 've done a horrendous mistake taking people who do n't want to assimilate . 
  also keep in mind that we have people coming to us from ukraine so we need to cope with immigrants too .
