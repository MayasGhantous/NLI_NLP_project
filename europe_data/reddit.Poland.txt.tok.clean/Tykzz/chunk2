  by the way a foundation in poland brought some syrian families to help them . 
  unfortunately it turned out that some of them did n't really need urgent help as they were trying to cross the border with germany . 
  given money for living and apartments . 
  i 'm for helping people who really need it . 
  but if they do n't respect what they 're given , let them get back to where they 're from . 
  immigration policy should be much more strict in europe . 
  i guess sweden is the worst example of it , welcoming everyone who wants to cross the border so immigrants can make some ghettos where the police does n't bother them . 
  we already have enough people coming from ukraine . 
  i would send back those who do n't respect what they 're given . 
   i sincerely believe that this is the biggest challenge europe has faced until now ( . . ) i guess you forgot about wars . 
  oh , so he knows at least some english . 
  good . 
  i think it 'd make a good impression . 
  i do n't know why someone would feel miffed , that 'd be silly . 
  also probably not many people watch diplomatic meetings . 
  i ca n't find anything . 
  true , it could 've been prepared . 
  on english wikipedia it says  gediminas , also known as hedzimin ( . . ) so it looks like a variation of that second name :p, 
  is n't it the tower which was covered with baltic countries ' flags ? 
  also i think [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/tui63mcxza0?t=1m10s ) relates to its legend , right ? 
  from wikipedia :  he grew up in the united states in leonia , new jersey , and graduated from leonia high school in 1972 as valedictorian . 
  ( . . ) he speaks both estonian and english as first languages , and he also is fluent in german , spanish and latvian . 
  ok , he learnt english in early years , that made it easier to him . 
  but anyway , my opinion on politicians remains the same . 
  of course it was . 
  i did n't because there was no occasion to do that . 
  i do n't know what mainstream media said about any of them as to language skills . 
  actually i do n't care . 
  i simply believe that the president , and other people who maintain diplomatic relations , should be able to speak english . 
  first it 's embarrassing when ( especially non-english ) politicians speak english and ours do n't . 
  and the second is - it 's their job . 
  no one would hire a manager , in an international company , who needs an interpreter to do business . 
  then why a politician - who is supposed to maintain foreign relations - can get their job and get paid ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i was trying to find something too and nothing . . 
  i looked at a video from eu deliberations and he spoke polish too . 
  so i do n't know what would be other reason instead of speaking no ( t enough ) english . 
   and watch cartoons on netflix . 
  vpn ? 
  [ really ] ( https://youtu.be/xrjavgtphmw?t=6m40s ) . . 
  pity he ca n't speak english . 
  edit : or at least he did n't manage to do that on the meeting . 
   czech sounds like a cute childish polish full of diminutives , it 's absolutely adorable :d [ totally agree ] ( http://intfolder.com/_ph/19/2/759282760.png ) .

  wow !, 
  i did n't know about it , thank you !, 
   even though they were made polish by force and before that they were made german by force . 
  i think tvp , the public broadcaster , is quite unbiased . 
  also polskie radio is pretty nice media . 
  i guess the most biased to the right is fronda.pl which is awfully bigot . 
  tvn , on the other hand , goes to the left . 
  i would n't say france is religious . 
  centraaaaaaaal :p, 
  spanish < 3, 
  i did n't like sunny beach but nessebar is great !, 
  thanks for the link . 
  now i understand the difference between the uk and gb ^ . ^ i think i heard about it before but forgot . 
  it 's a little confusing because in polish we refer to uk mostly as wielka brytania ( great britain ) instead of zjednoczone kr\u00f3lestwo ( united kingdom ) . 
  hmm i had that kind of situation in spain and bulgaria as far as i remember . 
  well , knowing some russian is enough to tell it apart from polish . 
  it 's like confusing japanese with chinese which - having contact with japanese - is unthinkable to me now . 
  i was in a bus in france . 
  a new driver came inside to interchange with his colleague . 
  they kissed each other on the cheeks :o that was kinda surprising but i think it 's nice that not only women are allowed to do things like that in public . 
  same with smiles when i was in spain , people there are so open !, 
  in poland that would be considered gay immediately or like `` wtf are you smiling at ?!, 
  when speaking polish , we 're often mistaken for russians . 
  probably germany ( i 'm from upper silesia ) ; lithuania , belarus and ukraine ( polish-lithuanian commonwealth ) ; czech republic and slovakia ( similarities in languages , west slavs ) ; hungary ( our friendship , lengyel magyar k\u00e9t j\u00f3 bar\u00e1t , 
  well , i think you need to be careful in most big cities . 
  really ? 
  i think it 's a great place !, 
   but muslims are something you have to deal with all over the continent nowadays so . . fortunately not all over . 
  what - in short - is he saying ? 
  i 'm disappointed too :(, 
   it just seems to be all political and generate songs no one really likes ( in most cases ) . 
  i do n't think so . 
  it all gets better , votes from countries were n't that predictable this year as they always were . 
  also the songs in general are better in quality . 
  personally i like many of the songs from the final . 
  but there 's no accounting for taste . 
  as to conchita 's song . 
  i think it is a nice piece of music too . 
  and it 's the president who can veto . 
   the usa , a country which is the perfect example of how a multi-cultural nation should operate . 
  oh really ? 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=baltimore+riots+2015&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=943&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=5qtivyligufxyqpoqygodg&amp;ved=0cb8qsaq ) ? 
  do hungarians like him ? 
  i 've visited sunny beach , it 's pure commercialism and i did n't like it . 
  but next to the sb there is a town called nessebar which is a truly beautiful place !, 
  this is crazy . 
  equality means that a woman and a man with the same level qualifications should be treated equally . 
  i ca n't understand idea of recruiting at least x amount of women/gays/black people/green-eyed people or whoever this way . 
  [ poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb-i6rpoo8e ), 
   but the ** cold ** water ( between 22-25\u00bac ) lol , it 's warm !, 
  for me it 's an ideal temperature for summer . 
  very beautiful !, 
  german  french  spanish, 
  racism does n't need to be intentional . 
  is n't it clear it 's rude ? . 
  it 's relating skin color to being subordinate .
