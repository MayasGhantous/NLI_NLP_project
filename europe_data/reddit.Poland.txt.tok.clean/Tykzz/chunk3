  like if black people were meant to serve . 
  like those idiots were right making black people their slaves back then . 
  calling someone `` murzyn '' is n't racist but using `` murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 '' as `` submissiveness '' ( because blacks were slaves back then ) is rude . 
  i 'm listening to the montenegro 's anthem for the first time and must say it sounds great !, 
  by mazurek d\u0105browskiego * d\u0105browski was a general , not a composer, 
  and polish `` no '' means yes, 
  * in march like in a pot . 
  * april mingler because it mingles , some of winter , some of summer . 
  i would n't translate `` murzyn '' to `` negro '' because the first is neutral and the second is pejorative . 
  i thought portuguese sounded mostly like spanish . 
  but then i played some portuguese videos and it 's really different !, 
  also i can hear some similarity with polish because of how much `` sh '' they say . 
  that 's so weird . 
  i guess it 's a very popular destination for people from all over the world . 
  i heard many times that french are very proud of their language . 
  but to that extent . . 
  really ? 
  there are no english descriptions in louvre ? 
  la marseillaise is pretty brutal . 
  i meant that as vilnius and lviv were once polish , they 're not anymore , just like wroc\u0142aw is not german anymore . 
  i did n't know austria would be willing . 
  the borders in europe were changed many times . 
  it does n't matter what nation ruled a city back then . 
  wroc\u0142aw is now polish , just like vilnius is lithuanian and lviv is ukrainian . 
  it 's not really popular . 
  you can see how many viewers the videos have . 
  comparing to , say , pop music , it 's a huge difference . 
  however i think that another band - [ percival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srard1nce30&amp;list=plx6xhes_em-ddtdt8vbzd2qlqbs3c6tin ) - became more popular because of the witcher 3 . 
  the band provided music for the game . 
  i guess some gamers ( prolly most of them are young ) got interested in the music and listened to other percival 's songs too . 
  edit : also it 's worth mentioning that percival performs songs from different slavic countries . 
  and the witcher 3 is popular world-wide so it 's not only polish viewers . 
  they have [ four ] ( http://rokiczanka.pl/en/wideo/#/fwdmspplayer0?catid=0&amp;trackid=0 ) . 
  it 's not many but you may get to like other bands too : * [ kapela ze wsi warszawa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhqmrtbq9tk&amp;list=pl5a18f130f70f443e&amp;index=24 ) * [ janusz prusinowski trio ] ( http://www.januszprusinowskitrio.pl/intro.php ) - it 's their website , you can play there some music and there is an option to download when you right click on the player * [ kapela oldnova ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgdr5y_haqu ), 
  * [ pie\u015b\u0144 woj\u00f3w ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rquo3popn9y ) * [ lipka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isuxzc9dugo ) * [ w moim ogr\u00f3decku ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp4endjmu1e ), 
  the first song somehow reminded me of ievan polkka but when i compared , it turned out to be quite different . 
  aww sounds mysterious . 
  i like that , 
  sounds like a combination of venom and enema . 
  pola means fields in polish . 
  is poola somehow related to this meaning ? 
  well , there are some discussions in polish tv too but it would be nice to have more official debates like this one in sweden and denmark . 
  however as far as i know , swedish tv is pretty restrictive when it comes to opinions opposed to the far-left . 
  that 's the effect of [ this way ] ( https://youtu.be/arjjmqdruui?t=46m24s ) of thinking . 
  when i heard about him the first time , i just thought he was a weird funny guy . 
  now i dislike him more and more . 
  another excuse to impose more control over the society . . 
  maybe they are just pretty open for changes ? 
  it 's not just polish mentality . 
  it happens in many other places all over the world . 
  in the time of polish-lithuanian commonwealth , the definition of republic was different . 
  that 's why it was called rzeczpospolita . 
  no , the word `` rzeczpospolita '' is a synonym of `` republika '' ( republic ) , both originated from latin `` res publica '' . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth can be also called rzeczpospolita but it 's just a short name for rzeczpospolita obojga narod\u00f3w . 
  also nowadays , our country 's full name is rzeczpospolita polska and it 's simply republic of poland . 
  it does n't mean commonwealth . 
  commonwealth is a different thing . 
  no , `` rzeczpospolita '' means `` republic '' . 
  i guess most people here do n't feel such a connection but we have some bands and festivals . 
  it just does n't seem really popular . 
  personally i really like folk music . 
  if you 'd like to listen to something polish , you may check these out : * kapela ze wsi warszawa : [ musia\u0142a\u015b ty dziewce ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmak4ds_ule ) , [ \u017burawie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhqmrtbq9tk ) * kapela oldnova : [ oj chmielu ] ( https://youtu.be/tgdr5y_haqu?t=6s ) * percival : [ oj dido ( album ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje_fzbb2so&amp;index=2&amp;list=pl3c86d37db2339a90 ) , by the way percival 's music was used in the witcher * rokiczanka : [ lipka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isuxzc9dugo ) , [ w moim ogr\u00f3decku ] ( https://youtu.be/hp4endjmu1e?t=25s ) , [ to i hola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujnz_cpidh0 ), 
  really ? 
  japanese or other swedes would be pretty disgusted i guess . 
  / r/videosofcities, 
  it 's a very nice souvenir . 
  i 'd call that `` france & italy '' tho , or maybe i 'm missing other countries ? 
  i do n't like this eagle , looks like a hen . 
  btw funny that you can see pkin in the background . 
  guess embassies are another thing . 
  anybody care to explain portugal and austria ? 
  so much money lost on another church . . like if there would n't be enough of them . 
  let alone it 's ugly . 
  i know but germany is usually considered western europe . 
  i 'm wondering why he considers germany and austria as in central europe ( another video ) but poland , czech rep. and slovakia are in eastern europe for him . 
  but while reading you lose focus on image . 
  listening vs reading skills in a foreign language is another thing . 
  using translation makes me uneducated ? 
  you can hear subdued voices of the actors . 
  anyway i understand someone may hate voice-overs , it 's a matter of preference . 
  of course you can but your eyes have to work more . 
  you need to keep up with both text and image . 
  here only movies for children are dubbed so the actual choice is subtitles or voice-over . 
  and sometimes i do n't feel like reading and watching at the same time so i choose voice-over . 
  i like a voice-over much more than a bad dubbing . 
  well , for emotions and passion they leave subdued voice of the actors . 
   movies on dvd/blue ray are either one of the two kinds of dubbing or subtitles . 
   movies online ( either streaming or piracy ) are almost universally subtitles . 
  there are also versions with voice-over . 
  single voice is not dubbing . 
  anyway the point of a voice-over is that you do n't have to read subtitles . 
  simple as that . 
  it 's something you can get used to . 
  in dubbing some voices may be annoying and not fit the characters . 
  when you have a voice-over you usually already know that voice and you do n't associate it with any characters . 
  it simply makes it easier to watch a movie because you do n't need to focus on subtitles . 
  illegal means prohibited by law . 
  if it was followed or not is another thing . 
  by the way , how do you know no one was ever punished by that law ? 
  even if no one was punished , homosexuality was illegal and that 's what i meant .
