  again ? 
  we usually lose to them . 
  it 's kinda far-fetched . 
  when poland regained independence in 1918 law previously imposed by occupiers was n't ( completely ) changed until 1932 . 
  during that time homosexuality was penalised . 
   pronounced krakov more like / krakoov /, 
  where is snow ? 
  it 's so silly . 
  leave polonium alone . 
   ano-2011 [ :d ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_z7o7p1b5vgehb4jwm3wuo0stnxtyj2kz,w400.jpg ), 
  it reminds me about [ our last referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_referendum,_2015 ) . 
  i wish we would finally have a nuclear power plant . 
  i 've been doing it with pizza my whole life . 
  i think so . 
  as far as i know , ukrainians assimilate well , apart from some incidents . 
  sounds like poland . 
  sure but it 's a long process . 
   use it to justify status quo i 'm not justifing anything . 
  and besides , if you compare only with the better , you may get depressed . 
  i 've never been to russia but from what i heard it 's worse there , especially that [ so called `` homo propaganda '' is banned there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_russia ) . 
   in june 2013 the national parliament ( the state duma ) unanimously adopted , and president vladimir putin signed , a nationwide law banning distribution of materials promoting lgbt relationships among minors . 
  the law does not explicitly mention the word `` homosexuality '' , but instead uses the euphemism `` non-traditional sexual relationships '' . 
  under the statute it is effectively illegal to perform any of the following in the presence of minors : hold gay pride events , speak in favor of gay rights , or say that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships . 
   critics say that the statute is written so broadly that it is in effect a complete ban on the gay rights movement and any public expression of lgbt culture . 
   in july 2013 , four dutch tourists were arrested for allegedly discussing gay rights with russian youths . 
  the four were arrested for allegedly spreading `` propaganda of nontraditional relationships among the under-aged '' after talking to teens at a camp in the northern city of murmansk . 
  also look at this [ map ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/side_a_rainbow_europe_map_2015_a3_no_crops.pdf ) and compare russia with other countries . 
  of course they 're are too common . 
  but i 'm comparing poland to russia where even law is against lgbt people . 
  it 's not that bad here . 
  i wonder why it 's worse in the south . 
  i typed in google search in polish * why the english . . * and the first result is * stomped on the polish flag *, 
  we use a verb * pada\u0107 * as * to fall * , used alone usually means * to rain * but with * \u015bnieg * added it means * to snow * . 
  you 're right , sorry . 
   i used the gdp figures from the wikipedia country pages . 
  it 's much different for 2016 , at least for poland . 
  oh so it 's not that my english is so bad . 
   ca n't trust a language where the written word and the spoken vary so greatly . 
  i 'd say english is less predictable when it comes to pronunciation . 
  your tl ; dr is almost as long as what you wrote first xd, 
  ** t ** is followed by ** sh ** sound here . 
  i think people tend to forget that the sound changes after letters like ** t ** or ** p ** and they try to pronounce ** rz ** like in ** rzeka ** . 
  it 's called hypercorrection . 
  first anti-rape wristbands , now dropping bibles . . sweden astonishes me, 
  i 'd say austria is more frequently considered a part of the western europe , is n't it ? 
  [ by\u0142 sobie kr\u00f3l ] ( https://youtu.be/sdkhogc9xq0?t=2m37s ), 
  that 's interesting that wikipedia takes the french name instead of polish . 
  have i said it 's a `` such a big deal '' ? 
  i 've just expressed my opinion . 
  kazimierz and jan would be better but here we speak english so it does n't stand out that much . 
  but why marie ? 
  she was polish , not french . 
  he was half polish and as far as i know he considered himself more polish than french , also he was born in poland . 
  and after all you list the greatest people of poland . 
  and the balkans, 
  why today 's lithuania is n't called nothern lithuania then ? 
  it 's just a small part of territories grand duchy of lithuania had . 
  i 'd say the word * czajnik * is more frequently used for a kettle . 
  you 're wrong . 
  it was communism - no capitalism , dictatorship , censorship , repression . 
  you 're right , we have a different mentality but i think it 's slowly changing and usually it 's not that bad as `` the customer can go fuck themselves '' . 
  also in my view , foreigners living in the uk should adjust to the customs there . 
  in polish * kraik * means a small country . 
  is the parliament obligated to implement the result of the referendum ? 
  in polish silesia it 's rather a really small number of people who want independence . 
  poland had the union with saxony but it was still poland , was n't it ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  poland called saxony ? 
  have i missed a history lesson ? 
  i think i 've read it in some article , it was quite a long time ago . 
  maybe it was about a crown estate as you mentioned . 
  i heard it 's forbidden to pick mushrooms in uk because they 're `` owned by the queen '' . 
  not sure if that 's true . 
  if you like music in the witcher , you should check out percival 's songs . 
  they have many that originate from [ eastern ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qfbqfdouy&amp;list=pl7io0fimybdgkl7bo8iel0wsgnve-8c9s ) and [ southern ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srard1nce30&amp;list=plx6xhes_em-ddtdt8vbzd2qlqbs3c6tin ) slavs . 
  the western songs in that cycle are n't ready yet but there are others in polish too , like in [ oj dido ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qychqtdrn6w&amp;list=pl489cd434d7876c24 ) album . 
  also i recommend other folk bands like : [ laboratorium pie\u015bni ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04fewqowud4 ) , [ jar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf29bk5bbnw ) , [ sati sauri ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fitvl-t42w4 ) , [ kapela ze wsi warszawa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfimqjjasvw ) , [ \u017bywio\u0142ak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihmp6eo05jk ) . 
  there 's also a new band called [ lelek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uflpsiymluq&amp;list=rduflpsiymluq ) , unfortunately only one song of the album is available on yt . 
  i think the first song ( hymn do swaroga ) is the best ( actually i do n't really like the rest ) , each full song can be bought [ here ] ( http://www.karrot.pl/ ) really cheap . 
  mixing folk and modern music [ can be fun too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpluxog7xq ) . 
  share if you have more , 
  identifying with a group does n't mean being xenophobic or facist or whatever bad you have in mind . 
  you , for example , identify with england as you put the english flag as your flair . 
  i do n't think you hate non-english people because of that . 
  slavic countries are culturally closer to each other , the languages are similar and in my opinion it makes people somewhat connected . 
  people get more open to each other when they have something in common . 
  also it 's fun when each person speaks in their own language and they can understand each other , at least a little . 
  there are many different groups of people . 
  what 's wrong with identifying with them and discussing ? 
  i guess - besides we 're all just people - you also name groups like men , women , english , british or whatever . 
  why ? 
  brilliant , you just gave yourself more arguments to leave this place . 
  also you are the one who 's bashing . 
  i think nobody needs here somebody who ca n't respect the others . 
  i 'd be ashamed of you in your countrymen 's place . 
  you 're saying something completely different with this insult . 
  of course switzerland produces everything itself / s, 
  apparently you should change the place for discussions , preferably in favor of something swiss , because here there are too many posts from the `` irrelevant '' and `` stuck-in-the-19th-century '' countries . 
   no , its evidence that those issues can be worked around you said they do n't get along so there are problems and it 's not worked around . 
   except for unifying europes foreign policy actions the eu has its foreign policy .
