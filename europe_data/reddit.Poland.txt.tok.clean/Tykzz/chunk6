  yeah , not only polish but also poles have another meaning, 
  why never seeing your host ? 
  here it 's : * breakfast ( \u015bniadanie ) in the morning , * lunch ( drugie \u015bniadanie - second breakfast ) which is usually some sandwiches you take to school / work , * dinner ( obiad , the biggest meal ) around 13-15 ( when not working ) or later after work , * supper ( kolacja ) around 20 , people who eat dinner late often skip the supper , that last meal may be called obiadokolacja ( dinner-supper ) then, 
  just a normal name here . 
  i 'd like to know more about times before christianisation , about slavic customs and beliefs . 
  we do n't know much about it which makes it even more interesting . 
  yes because `` beautiful '' is much stronger than `` suits you '' and speaking about eyes is rather in romantic tone . 
  saying `` wow your new hairstyle really suits you '' as opposed to `` you have beautiful eyes '' is kinda different . 
  hejnalista , it 's a trumpeter playing [ hejna\u0142 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._mary%27s_trumpet_call ) every hour from the tower of the saint mary 's church in krak\u00f3w . 
  english - lingua franca , gives so many opportunities french - i just like the way it sounds and it has many speakers spanish - same as french czech/slovakian - cute and funny italian - i like that `` singing '' way of speaking, 
  any communist monument left . 
  it 's a controversial topic . 
  the building is often used as representative of warsaw or poland . 
  it 's the highest one in the whole country , it makes it easier to navigate in the city . 
  it encompasses lots of institutions . 
  on the other hand , it 's considered a symbol of soviet domination , some people say it 's ugly . 
  after the government has changed , in the public tv station they changed the background from one showing that building to one with the royal castle . 
  i think they 'd have to build something bigger and more distinctive to degrade pkin . 
  that the russians are guilty of [ the crash in smole\u0144sk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) . 
  not just newspapers . 
  it 's mostly germans that people talk about but there are also the others . 
  i 've just found [ a chart depicting that ] ( http://static1.money.pl/i/h/74/art377930.jpg ) . 
  turns out there are americans too . 
  i do n't know how much impact it has on the content tho . 
  for sure anything promoting globalism stands against national identity . 
  ah true , i thought about press . 
  popular names in poland are usually adapted ones which derive mainly from greek , latin and hebrew ( bible ) . 
  these names are given quite rarely , they 're more common among elderly people . 
  what american media are there in poland ? 
  there 's no such a country i know i will never go to . 
  i believe that each country has its places worth visiting . 
  just some of them may be less attractive or safe to me at the moment . 
   having to explain what `` tea with milk '' is , and i 'm not even british . 
  who are you then ? 
  haha , we have something similar with [ these ladies ] ( http://memytutaj.pl/uploads/2014/02/05/a-po-co-a-na-co-to-komu.jpg ) saying * what for ? 
  who does need that ? * . 
  it comes from a street poll about marijuana but it 's now used for everything . 
  some of them : [ you 're radiating from the very morning , my love ] ( http://img1.demotywatoryfb.pl//uploads/201006/1276182715_by_wroobelek95_600.jpg ) [ here bang yourself ] ( https://66.media.tumblr.com/622643f34bb8c36bc5b7b68b904e92cc/tumblr_mj6o9bi4ha1re7nfzo1_540.png ) - another maria sk\u0142odowska-curie 's famous pic [ i can only say one thing to the passengers who were freezing in the trains : sorry but that 's our climate ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/g/i.aspx/-670/0/newsweek/635258974819567300.jpg ) [ finally , a-bitnese-of-rapenese ] ( http://img.jbzd.pl/2015/05/24626d9c81ef9c985d26bf0ba12c1867.jpg ) - it 's a series where you play with words and make them sound like chemical compounds , this one is related to the famous statement - * you always rape a little * by korwin mikke [ every f * cking time ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_rjbpticqriqwplpakfhqzmbxzuwokbhm,w400.jpg ) - razem is a new leftist party , the name mean both * time * ( as in first time ) and * together * [ do n't let the leftists chip you ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_45exei7lrtnjf3x0ecyadujnvv0ar3gu.jpg ) - korwin again [ f * ck , what a kick ] ( http://zryte.pl/img/mem/ale_faza_60.jpg ) - lech wa\u0142\u0119sa , actually there are quite many memes with him too, 
  there are problems with public transport even in such big cities ?

  why is there so much hate on sarkozy ? 
  i 've noticed it just recently . 
  * czesko * looks as polish as * czech republic * which is because we use * cz * and you 've reformed the ortography . 
  could be * chesco * instead . 
  i did n't know about serbs vs croats . 
  why is that ? 
  would * czesco * or * cesko * be better ? 
  do n't talk like if one could n't have a good life in poland . 
  it 's nice of them , makes me smile . 
  i 'm not a connoisseur but i drink [ this one ] ( http://www.malwatea.com/images/herbaty/owocowe-ekspresowe/ho-hibiskus-b.jpg ) since always . 
  it 's red like blood . 
  but no , i 'm not romanian . 
  [ wroc\u0142aw ] ( http://www.jarmarkbozonarodzeniowy.com/ ) , [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3nxgfkdekc ), 
  and stop pursuing ideas we ca n't afford . 
  well , one of our politician would like monarchy back . 
  anyway even if the eu collapsed , schengen might be still preserved in one way or another . 
   perhaps if the anti-euro movement gets it 's way , the shengen agreement will be cancelled , and poland might not be a part of a new version of shengen . 
  where does it come from ? 
  poland is one of the most pro-eu countries . 
  do n't you say `` kattowitz '' ? 
  but poland or germany are n't called this way . 
  you can read about it [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22polish_death_camp%22_controversy ) . 
  a fragment :  the west german intelligence formed agency 114 ( german : dienststelle 114 ) within the gehlen organization ; headed by alfred benzinger ( a nazi abwehrpolizei ) , who in 1956 launched a coordinated action to move the blame away from the war criminals under various investigations . 
  benzinger adopted the deliberately ambiguous , loaded phrase `` polish death camps '' in the mid 1960s in order to suggest , contrarily to the facts , that poles , not germans , were responsible for the mass genocide during world war ii . 
   it would be weird to not know someone from latin america . 
  why ? 
  it 's so far away from spain after all . 
  you mean expats ? 
  getting lentilky in czech republic < 3 i was about 5 . 
  but it was just a walk across the border when i was at my aunt 's . 
  my first holidays abroad ( like staying there and recreation ) were when i was 17 . 
  it was in spain and i loved how many things were different and exciting . 
  * kombinowa\u0107 * - to skilfully look for a solution to a problem , often bending the rules . 
  also can be used when someone is doing something suspicious . 
  instead of dam to rafa\u0142owi they say dam to dla rafa\u0142a it 's a regionalism, 
  * obudzi\u0107 si\u0119 z r\u0119k\u0105 w nocniku * ( to wake up with your hand in a potty ) - to be in a situation when it 's too late to prevent something * zastaw si\u0119 , a postaw si\u0119 * ( hard to translate but something like : borrow but show them ) - if you have a guest , let them see abundance even if you have to borrow / get a loan * co ma wisie\u0107 , nie utonie * ( what 's supposed to hang wo n't drown ) - things supposed to happen will happen anyway, 
  here * fart * means luck, 
   some obvious acronyms are known ( like a/c ) a/c is not obvious . 
  we say ac for autocasco but a/c seems to be an air conditioner and we do n't use it in polish . 
   in silesia region ( silesian dialect aside ) people often use german word for train - `` zug '' it may be more common for people who are 50 + but the younger do n't speak silesian much . 
  as for annoying things i 'd add that so many shops announce their sales in english . 
  all the more reason that `` sale '' is a word in polish too and it means `` halls '' . 
  * - * that 's how you sneeze for a shot !, 
  ( of vodka ) * but seriously mostly it 's * na zdrowie !, 
  * - * to health !, 
  * , same as for a toast or we do n't say anything ( i heard that 's according to savoir-vivre ), 
  really ? 
  you do n't take shoes off in spain ? 
  obsession about history . 
  i mean it 's important to remember things but when i read another article about how the polish suffered because of the others and i see these comments full of hatred towards the other nations . . 
  it makes me mad . 
  also so many of our holidays are about tragic past . 
  i wish we would think more about positive things ( as a nation ) . 
  by the way * smole\u0144sk * movie just came out . 
  they say there is a scene in which two groups of . . ghosts appear . 
  the first is the victims of the [ katy\u0144 massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) and the other is the victims of the [ smole\u0144sk crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) with the former president and his wife . 
  and they salute and welcome each other . .
