not anymore , i 'm afraid : http://www.jpost.com/international/north-african-men-attempt-to-stone-transgender-women-in-german-city-441695, 
  i 'm pretty sure putin has more important things on his mind . 
  why against russia ? 
  yes !, 
  however , i think it should be an eastern european union , so that we could invite hungary to the club , 
  ungrateful people . 
   as a homosexual , i am afraid for my life and my freedom . 
  i am afraid to hold my girlfriend 's hand in the street . 
  would you rather live in germany , where people throw stones at lgbt people ? 
  i think not . 
  that does n't even make sense , but ok ...

  that 's not what i meant . 
  the article used the word `` nazi '' when it should have used the word `` german '' because there is no such thing as a nationalist uniform . 
  this is clearly propaganda because nobody can really be that stupid . 
  true , i guess i 'll change it to `` westerners '' . 
  we 're starting from scratch * right now * . 
  oh no , we 're so scared . 
  poland is doing fine , and we will continue to improve no matter how many westerners scream in our face . 
   gone is the poland that wanted to have a say in europe oh really ? 
  just watch us . 
   many european politicians have expressed their concerns oh my god . 
  they * expressed their concerns * ? 
  nooooo ...  it seems like the pro-pis media propaganda is starting . 
  check out the cover of the polish news magazine `` wprost '' , depicting angela merkel , jean-claude juncker , martin schulz , guy verhofdstad , and g\u00fcnther \u00d6ttinger in nazi uniforms ... first of all , the picture sums up everything pretty well . 
  second of all , they are * german * uniforms , not * nazi * uniforms . 
  and third of all , this whole article is one big piece of propaganda , so please , do n't criticize others . 
  i never thought i would live to see an independent poland . 
  it 's time to rise !, 
   nonetheless , it should be made clear to the polish government that its retreat from the fundamental values of liberal democracy is reprehensible and foolish .

   with civic platform still nursing its defeat , poland is going to need a strong opposition to salvage the gains made over the past decade . 
  if not , the loss to poland , the eu , and eastern europe will be very , very big . 
  this is so pathetic . 
  so much propaganda in two sentences . 
   if only a land like that was properly governed and organised by a better culture the germans already tried that . 
  yes , sir . 
  which things should i edit ? 
   `` germans and poles are neighbors , partners , friends , '' he said . 
  `` we want to preserve and further precisely that -- even deepening it where possible . '', 
  since when ? 
   tomasz lis , poland 's most important news anchorman he 's just butthurt because he 's losing his job . 
   behind all the moves is pis party leader kaczynski why is everyone so obsessed with kaczy\u0144ski ? 
   during the european refugee dispute , european parliament president schulz already suggested he would be prepared to use this mechanism in order to force the poles to behave . 
  schulz is pathetic . 
  yeah right . 
  protect your women , not our democracy . 
  true , but personally i think it just added humor to the letter . 
  i do n't see how germans find this offensive . 
  they did it . 
  they did n't pay the debt . 
  it 's not over . 
  why ? 
   yes , magazines like `` pani domu '' or `` komputer \u015awiat '' were directly controlled from berlin . 
  come on , i 'm talking about politics . 
   like what ? 
  for example what gazeta wyborcza said about the nato summit . 
   fun fact , slaves do n't get paid .

  well , it might not have been exactly leftist , but still evil . 
  pis won the elections because poles finally woke up and realized how silly po was , with all their lies and propaganda . 
  i think the brainwashing became too obvious . 
  nope . 
  happy birthday , by the way . 
  it 's true though , no matter how anti-german it is . 
  but ... what ? 
  yes it does . 
  the government ca n't function properly when leftist media is spitting out lies and brainwashing people . 
  i know right ? 
   but do people seriously think we can just close our borders , prevent more refugees from coming , and maybe kick those out who are causing trouble ? 
  yes . 
   aside from the fact that it is almost impossible to close all borders to germany , i bet if it would be done , the same of you who are crying `` incompetence '' now would be crying `` nazis '' if it would be started . 
  no , we would all love you forever . 
   also , the right to seek asylum is part of our constitution , it 's not like germany has the right to close its borders . 
  they are not refugees , therefore you do not have to do anything . 
  most of the media was controlled by germany and promoted all kinds of pathetic lies that people actually believed . 
  the eu is pissed because we 're no longer their slaves . 
  people will stop getting brainwashed by biased anti-pis media .

  zbigniew ziobro is a genius . 
  the european union does n't want us to be a strong country , does it ? 
   dont * you * remember ? 
  what do you mean by that ? 
   anti-german statements by polish politicians like what ? 
  ooh , europe is mad at us . 
  we 're so scared . 
  what can the eu even do to poland ? 
  organize a march ? 
  tell us how bad we are ? 
  poland finally has a good government . 
  next thing you know every muslim man turns homosexual . 
  the eu can not possibly harm poland in any way , especially now that it 's starting to fall apart ... drowning in the massive wave of immigrants . 
  we do n't have any of that since pis came to power . 
   ridiculous polish politics what exactly do n't you like ? 
   they have a rude manner of stopping by and not leaving for few hundred years . 
  lol brilliant
