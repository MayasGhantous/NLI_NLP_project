i 'm honored getting a response from such a hardcore nationalist like you . 
  you sure you have n't mistaken the sites ? 
  should n't you go back to wykop ? 
  i had you tagged long time ago as being a vicious troll , so cheers . 
  i do n't know about that , we 've got a [ transgender ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_grodzka ) member of parliament , so we 're good on the bearded ladies front at least . 
  it means being poor , special needs savage in mine , that 's why i dislike the association . 
  berlin wall is no more . 
   what 's the point of posting this ? 
  it 's polish approach , we love to self hate . 
  do n't speak to me , you scum . 
  deluge nevah forget . 
  i 'm guessing [ zaolzie ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie ), 
  i use `` oyro '' usually in a mocking tone . 
   imagine how dicky 16 year old poles are . 
  oh they 're pretty dicky , i should know , i was one years ago . 
   seriously when i was there all they wanted from me was money and if they did n't get it they just hated me and that happened to everyone there . . 
  they also scammed a lot that 's just how we roll , at least they did n't steal your car , so you got that going for you . 
  so are 16 year olds . 
   poland 's acceptance of eu can into space ?!, 
  can france into not stale jokes ? 
  same here , also i 'm learning so much about poles from a swede that visited my country once . 
  [ no they 're not . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gda%c5%84sk#etymology ) `` the name of a settlement was recorded after st. adalbert 's death in ad 997 as urbs gyddanyzc ''  by calling them the polish names the last bit of german culture gets lost . 
  well , since they were originally polish ( gda\u0144sk was founded in 997 ) , were polish for the most part of their history ^ 1 , and are polish now , we should stick to the original name . 
  ^ 1 [ 230 +14 +103 +224 = 571 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gda%c5%84sk#history ) years ( not counting pomeralia , even though we could ) then we have another 69 after ww ii . 
   you can not argue how badass these names sound . 
  well , it 's a matter of opinion , but to me me german sounds really harsh and i hate the sound of it . 
  every time i hear it ( and i hear it a lot , living in szczecin ) my ears start to bleed . 
  also gda\u0144sk sounds way cooler than dansy\u015b . 
   is this just because poland has a bad rep ? 
  wat , why ? 
   i am a little surprised that poland is 0.0 i think it 's just the fact that poland is very homogeneous , like 96 % of the population is polish . 
  i do n't know . 
  we have some [ minorities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_minorities_in_poland#demography ) but as [ op ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2j7ok7/percentage_of_eea_countrys_population_made_of_eea/cl97b14 ) said , they 're not eea so it 's not showing on the map . 
   danzing seriously ? 
   besides , how would it really have played out for poland had britain/france gone in guns blazing in the first few weeks of the war as i do n't feel like typing and this discussion comes up every few days with tons of missinformed bullshit , i 'm gon na have to send you [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fjgyv/with_headquarters_in_poland_the_united_kingdom/ck9ytll?context=3 ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fjgyv/with_headquarters_in_poland_the_united_kingdom/cka0p6t?context=3 ) as / u/jaquestrap explained it much better than i ever could 've . 
   that does n't really explain france and germanys stance . 
  they do n't have a moat . 
  they have a buffer state , us . 
   they still want to hold easter and christmas as in polish tradition i 'm agnostic myself and i consider those traditions , as you said , polish , cultural traditions . 
  if i will have children of my own someday i will still follow those traditions . 
  the religion does n't matter in that case . 
   or to take christian marriage does n't only one person has to be catholic for a church marriage ? 
  and if both are atheist/agnostic , what 's the point anyway ? 
   well , srsly what 's the point of apostasy , it would be just limiting yourself . 
  the point is not being associated with the catholic church , inflating their numbers and giving them more political power . 
   three people were sentenced for stealing a complete train ( 25 empty rail cars ) . 
  they sold it with false paperwork into poland . 
  ca n't help but laugh at that . 
   declared faith at around 90 % that 's such a bullshit statistic , people being considered catholic because they 're baptized and ca n't be bothered to go through the act of apostasy . 
  i do n't know if it 's just western pomerania , but i just do n't see those numbers , especially among young people . 
  i wish they would introduce some kind of tax , the numbers would drop by half . 
  seems like something straight out of a fairy tale . 
  man , alps are beautiful . 
  but i only have pieorogi ruskie , i 'm conflicted ... 
   i had a decent reason you bet against us , did n't ya ? 
  not that i can blame you , i was predicting 3:0 for them . 
  i 'm ecstatic as well , but should n't we contain those news to / r/soccer alone ? 
  you are not old enough to drink , but i guess you can die for your country if you want . 
  i know , i was just being facetious . 
   does that mean that we ca n't bitch about every $ they spent anymore ? 
  but , but 400 tanks !, 
  why are you such a meanie , destroying my hopes and dreams . 
  you still have n't tried the one from my city , so i will cling to that straw . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  i love 'em ( the ones in [ szczecin ] ( http://barrab.pl/ ) anyway ) , also did n't you read that the guy was from turkey ? 
  so it was probably some kind of doner kebab . 
  we love to self-hate and have generally negative outlook on the reality , do n't we ? 
  you ? 
  pft , was there any irish pope ? 
  yeah , i did n't think so !, 
  i could , but people would think i 'm a lunatic . 
  we do n't really have a reason , it 's just you guys hatin ' on us . 
  we 're sharing nothing !, 
  they 're ours !, 
  ours i say !, 
  do n't worry hungary-kun i still wuv you \u3063 ' \u0437 ' ) \u3063 ( \u10e6\u02c7 \u25e1 \u02c7 ) ~ \u2665, 
  it was / u/ionuttzu with `` and this is why poles can go fuck themselves , cancer of europe '' , he deleted his message pretty fast , luckily res does n't forget . 
  but so do we , since we are similar in that aspect we should like each other !, 
  it 's not called [ western betrayal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal ) without a reason . 
   but to act like we somehow betrayed poland is just ... absurd . 
  i really could n't care less , but to act like the sole reason you entered the war was to help poor little poland ( which you failed to do ) is na\u00efve . 
  countries act in their own self interests . 
   we did you fucking moron haha , you seem angry . 
   be as ungrateful as you please but it 'll just breed resentment towards you . 
  there is already a resentment , and why would i be grateful ? 
  i do n't have anything against brits . 
  the only thing that annoys me in that whole conversation is that you act like lord and saviour and expect eternal gratitude when in fact you did squat . 
  gief back our gold , books and artifacts , you thief . 
  you could 've done anything and that would 've been more than this [ sitzkireg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war ) . 
  russia not seeing any reaction from the west , invaded us 2 weeks after germany did . 
  germoney , [ sure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) , but the rest , hell no . 
  if americans can call their silly baseball championship `` world series '' , i guess such an union could be called the galactic empire , why not . 
  is building gundams an option ? 
  because i vote for that . 
  i want central europe to get money , fuck those guys in the east . 
  now gibi moni . 
  you know that in order to be `` us of e '' you 'd have to take the `` shitty '' parts too ? 
  it 's a package deal , so you 're getting russia as a neighboor .
