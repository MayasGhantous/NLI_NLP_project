  good luck . 
   kebab were you not paying attention ? 
  and that 's fine , but / u/specofdust is ** offended ** by the accusations of betrayal . 
  how would you call [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tehran_conference ) ? 
  and then sat on your asses dropping leaflets , while country was being torn to pieces , only to hand us out to russians after the war . 
  i 'm not holding a grudge , but stop pretending like you entered the war `` because of poland '' . 
  instead we got only [ ~ 16 % murdered ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#human_losses_by_country ) and quarter russianized for the next half a century . 
  you seem pretty upset ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  we like you , your language sounds funny to us , like you 're talking in diminutives all the time . 
  i heard that polish sounds like redneck czech language , any truth to that ? 
  what can i say , i have trust issues : <, 
  americans are borg , confirmed . 
  russians ca n't throw their whole military at once , leaving their home vulnerable . 
  it would be defensible . 
  our army is n't really that week , we could hold on for some time until reinforcements arrive . 
  last time we held out for over a month , being squashed from 2 sides . 
  this time we would n't get attacked from the west at the same time ( i hope ) . 
  and that 's the whole argument for nato bases in the east . 
   pyrenees to be fair , that 's a great defensive line , i 'd pick alps myself though . 
   or even western europe . 
  thanks , man . 
  [ sure it is ;\\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xrxmc.gif ), 
  it should be romania-kun , since we 're their senior ( even if you count wallachia ) !, 
  but , but , we were already [ there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros%c5%82aw_hermaszewski ) !, 
  and apart from being a member of esa we 're creating our own space agency !, 
  ` tis all anti-polish propaganda , i 'm tellin ' you !, 
  and what did we get in return for all that , not even an invite to the victory parade . 
  i 'm not bitter , not bitter at all !, 
  really , the mighty americans ? 
  they must be decent then . 
  it is softer at the end , so i guess more like f. i did n't want to make it more confusing . 
  yeah , i get that . 
  english speakers just need to know that our `` w '' is `` v '' and '' \u0142 '' sounds like american `` w '' and the rest is easy . 
  but , but it 's easy as well , kinda like [ `` vrotz wav '' . 
  if we 're playing a game who was there first , i guess it 's still us , since it was founded by the first polish ruler mieszko in ~ 970-980 . 
  he 's / r/europe court jester , he says funny things like that all the time . 
  it 's the same guy that still believes the propaganda about horse charge against tanks in krojanty , i would n't pay attention to him at all . 
  haha , you do that too ? 
  it 's almost like in that dave chappele skit , but instead of ja rule i always ask myself `` i wonder what dukenpl has to say about this matter '' . 
  i personally loved it , it has this surreal feel to it , it 's almost an art , really . 
   somewhat anti-russia / annihilation is the only solution . 
   maybe we should have kept the colony in tobago !, 
  man , i share the sentiment and i wish we succeeded in [ getting ] ( http://anglopolish.com/index.php/en/archive/11-polish-interests/107-madagaskar-as-polish-colony ) [ madagascar . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonization_attempts_by_poland ), 
  i think it was [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cedynia ) or [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teutonic_takeover_of_danzig_\\ ( gda % c5 % 84sk \\ ) ) or was it [ this ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald ) i ca n't remember . 
   how they were `` saved '' by their slavic brothers what ?!, 
  where did you learn that bullshit ? 
  literally no one in poland thinks that way . 
  only russian portray themselves as the saviors , while we all know they were as much if not more evil than nazi germany . 
  we might be bitter about our wwii alliances , by `` why die for gdansk ? 
  '' , [ sitzkrieg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war ) and yalta betrayal , so while for you war ended in ' 45 , for poland it was '89 and it is kinda understandable why we hold a grudge , but no one but russians thinks of soviets as liberators . 
  wtf . 
  baltics are easy , balkans ( former yugoslavia mostly ) on the other hand always give me trouble ( except croatia with its specific shape ) . 
  same here , and while i was at it i felt the need to learn every capital as well . 
  dae polan can not into space , guise ? 
  as brief review of his comments shows that 's / r/europe court jester , just move along . 
  they 're one of the most powerful and feared militaries in history , of course not , but the stereotype is there . 
   how many gears does a polish tank have ? 
  four reverse and one forward , in case the enemy comes from behind . 
  we have indentical one about french , and i 'm surprised to hear that joke about poles . 
  i mean i heard plenty of stupid/thieves pollacks jokes , but about cowardice it 's the first one and does n't make sense to me , and coming from germany nonetheless . 
  maybe he saw a [ rabbit with crpv . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shope_papilloma_virus ) the story is still ridiculous but you never know !, 
  supported argentina obviously , and i 'm baffled there is so many supporting germany . 
  i 'm not mad at all . 
  and you do n't know if they would be as good , the same academies gave us lewandowski . 
  i 'm just arguing against cheering for them for being polish while they 're not . 
  because even if you guys do n't treat as as such because our team is shit and has been for 30 years , you are our direct rivals , so when i hear the whole `` well at least klose and podolski are polish '' while they 're singing `` deutschland , deutschland uber alles '' at the same time i ca n't help it but laugh . 
  no they 're not , they are product of german football academies and they chose to play for germany . 
   and it 's not like they would have a shot at any important titles playing for poland yeah then why would i cheer for them again ? 
  might as well cheer for muller , no difference . 
  lol , because you have to support the favourite ? 
  i supported argentina and i watch football since ' 98 , but i would support any country that is not germany , so there is that . 
  they 're exactly the reason to do the opposite . 
  i 've used both , but you seriously never heard of [ `` pu\u015bci\u0107 komu\u015b strza\u0142k\u0119 '' ? 
  i share the sentiment . 
  as long as germany does n't win the world cup i 'm happy . 
  til i live in the most dangerous part of poland , and i thought krak\u00f3w had it covered with their machetes . 
  edit . 
  we are not the worst in overall [ crime rate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_poland#polish_cities ) , apparently we just like to murder people . 
  haha , i got : our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 2 . 
  south african 3 . 
  singaporean our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  norwegian 2 . 
  swedish 3 . 
  dutch so not even close . 
  i wonder , does that mean my english is that good or that bad . 
  i was just trying to imply that you should use russian , not polish , for that joke , but this explanation kills a joke . 
   btw you probably should n't say `` german camps '' as well . 
  because we all know those elusive nazis came from space and were a different race altogether . 
   you just have to move on and accept the russia of the 50 's 60 's 70 's hell even the 80 's no longer exists . 
  the main problem with that is , that it does exist , as we 've all seen from the recent events . 
  we 'd take you in a heartbeat . 
   you were our liberators do n't even use that word because they really believe that they liberated us and it was all peachy .
