  using harpoons !, 
  ( not joking ), 
  being european , that 's what they were talking about , unless you were following polish media back then and you know better . 
  [ yeah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_space_agency ) , [ kinda . 
  but , you 're hungarian , so by default you are european . 
  it sounds like that time when poland got accepted to join eu and people were saying `` we are finally in europe ! '', 
  nope , we were always here ? 
   what are they fighting for anyway , they 're fighting to get out of the country , join the eu and emigrate . 
  haha , yes , they ca n't wait to migrate to uk and take your jobs and benefits . 
  and you are not painting one . 
  nah , they 're just from first world countries , are clueless and naive , thinking everywhere is the same as in their own , little cozy and safe places . 
  `` why do n't they join hands and sing kumbaya ? 
  what a horrible barbarians '' . 
  nato would send an angry letter , that 's for sure . 
   black and red flag [ it 's ukrainian insurgent army 's flag . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army ) as a [ pole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) , not really fond of the usage . 
   yay for your past being greater than the present . 
  oh , so you 're polish after all ? 
  so first ivory coast then ... indonesia ? 
  or is that monaco 's flag ? 
  too bad we did n't get that madagascar though  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maurice_benyovszky, 
   why do the vast majority of people pick american english over british english ? 
  of course there are many different british accents , but for me personally it 's because i just do n't like the sound of british english . 
  it sounds snobbish and uptight . 
  we are also being bombarded by american culture via movies , music , games and other media , so we tend to pick up their accents . 
  even now , you are commenting on an american site , with over 50 % of the population being american and writing the american way . 
  so i guess our tendency to speak with american accent instead of british is thanks to the american cultural victory . 
  let 's be honest , you do n't even have to be that good . 
  same here in west pomeranian . 
  i 've never even heard about such a thing let alone attended . 
  it has many meanings from damn , fuck , shit , bitch , whore to functioning as a comma or expressing joy and admiration . 
  not unlike english `` fuck '' but thanks to polish grammar it 's way more flexible . 
  we have similar saying in polish , atrributed to j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski . 
  which roughly translates as `` wonderful nation , but the people are cunts '' . 
  it says `` whores '' , but i felt `` cunts '' fits better in this context . 
  but i have !, 
  you guys just do n't know the beauty of swearing in polish , it 's almost an art . 
  kurwa can bu used as any part of speech not only as a noun , you just need to add/change prefix/sufix . 
  `` very beautiful/awesome '' ( in a vulgar way ) would be i guess `` wykurwisty . '', 
  sure , some people use it as a comma , but i was just saying that those endless possibilities exist . 
  because some people lack creativity does n't invalidate that . 
  my point was i feel restricted while swearing in english , of course that might be just because that 's it 's not my native tounge , but i think thanks to conjugation , declination and changing prefixes and sufixes , swearing becomes more interesting . 
  `` fuck '' has got nothning on `` kurwa '' . 
  from my polish perspective i feel like english swear words in general lack finesse and are very plain when compared to slavic languages , but you are right . 
  it 's very flexible and universal , it can display wide array of emotions and mean many things . 
   they all had mandatory russian lessons in the primary/middle school . 
  besides being able to read cyrillic or counting to ten , most of those people still speak fuck all of russian . 
  there is no need , by now it 's probably all white < insert overused french joke here  . 
  landing safely . 
  funnily enough , we are always embarrassed by it and think that it was us , that invented this trend , same goes for clapping on airplanes ( which many people attribute to americans ) . 
  well , unfortunately there are more germans on / r/europe than poles , and they just keep downvoting any opinion , no matter how mild , that contradicts their view . 
  let 's compromise on nazi germany death camps . 
   there 's nothing too low for a pole . 
  oh , look , it 's this guy again spewing his anti-polish bullshit . 
  edit . 
  one if his bests quotes [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2tlq4r/cnn_calling_auschwitzbirkenau_polish_camps/co0kuhx ) guy 's a natural . 
   but it does n't seem to happen enough to warrant this kind of response ( meaning the billboards that was mentioned another place in this thread ) . 
  it 's not about frequency , the fact that this kind of mistake happens at all is a problem . 
  some people say it 's counterintelligence at work , trying to twist history , some say it 's just an honest mistake , language difference or ignorance . 
  does n't matter . 
  as many posters here already stated `` truth gets blurry with time '' and we ca n't mistake victim with a culprit . 
  but that does n't stop modern germans from calling him german . 
  my whole shitposting argument was , that you have to take the good with the bad and that the death camps were n't build by some ancient race of nazis , but germans . 
  well should 've thought about it earlier . 
  now it derailed the whole thread deflecting the issue to something irrelevant . 
  those were nazis , not germans after all . 
  remember . 
   he was born in bonn ... is that a yes then ? 
  it 's certainly amusing being called a retard by someone who ca n't even spell the word right . 
  i do n't know that word . 
  could i get a definition ? 
  thanks . 
  was beethoven german ? 
  or maybe that part of history suits you and it 's fine calling him one ? 
   no , we give credit to governments and people , not countries . 
  countries change over time , since it 's leadership , culture and opinion also shifts . 
  and yet it was japanese that massacred chinese in nanking , americans that bombed hiroshima , french that sat on their asses participating in the phoney war and poles that annexed zaolzie . 
  for some reason german and russian states during that period get a magical label `` nazi '' and `` soviet '' and a free pass . 
   really ? 
  you are going to compare the change in leadership from republicans to democrats to the change from genocidal fascism to democracy ? 
  yes i will , because that 's the change from one political party to another . 
  since the goverment represents the country and its people we usually give credit to countries not political parties . 
  i do n't see how germans are exceptions to that . 
  you ca n't just whitewash your country by blaming it on the nazis . 
   i would almost say that equating modern day germany to nazi-germany is the same as calling the death camps polish . 
  good one . 
  it 's not about modern day germany , but the german state in general . 
  so i guess following that logic guantanamo was a republican detention camp ? 
  nazis did n't appear from some other dimension . 
  those were german or nazi german camps , if you want to be precise . 
  it was just a pun , polls / poles , so you are the one complaining about complaining . 
  alright then that settles it , as a fan of chobits , [ magda `` chi '' og\u00f3rek ] ( https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/17089_968469529859762_5626638632389601301_n.jpg?oh=38dc9355bae9708773ad23ad17e14840&amp;oe=55beb03c ) gets my vote . 
  she might not know anything about anything , but at least she is pleasant to look at . 
  i feel the same way , who do i vote for who is n't a conservative catholic ? 
  i 'd vote for palikot if he were n't a populist and just as insane as the rest . 
  the chunk that was taken by czechoslovakia 20 years earlier while poland was fighting the bolsheviks . 
  we can do this all day . 
   reminds me of the force field in dune ( the lynch film , imma not reading no stinking books ) . 
  i was going to post the same thing and praise on your taste in sci-fi , but the second part ruined the moment .
