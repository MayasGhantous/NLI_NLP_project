  those movies and tv series are so terrible . 
  [ 100 % 1:18 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4oqyikr.png ) only because last time similar map was posted i took time to learn it , along with capitals and us states . 
  german humor . 
  am i right or am i right ? 
  holy shit , that subreddit is a cesspool . 
  i ca n't read some of those comments without clenching my fists . 
  using polonized english loan-words , when there is perfectly fine polish equivalent for it . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31bey9/on_a_scale_of_1_to_french_how_nationalistic_is/cq05ua0 ) comment has some examples . 
  i 'm not a coward , but if you think that those kinds of training sessions ( and our previous military service ) will teach you anything other than drinking large amounts of alcohol then you are ~ ~ delusional ~ ~ naiive . 
   i think it 's a culture thing . 
  then you would be wrong . 
  so it 's near iceland ? 
  got it !, 
  it 's [ this national image ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe ) among poles where we see ourselves as a martyr and a country that has endured great deal of injustice . 
  two world wars and one world cup !, 
  the christ of all nations . 
   we buffed you bruh we pushed you to the limits :p [ 1683 , best day of my life . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ) thanks for making us swole , for a while at least . 
  you forgot the most important dwarven-polish quality : they hold grudges for literally centuries . 
   humour version & nbsp ;  poland - crushed by germany and russia my sides !, 
   this will blow your mind : i mean it really does blow mine . 
  how can people live like that ? 
  looking mainly at americans here . 
  in my house i 've got not only a fence but i 'm putting bigger and bigger trees ands other greenie thingies just so i do n't have to see the neighbours and they wo n't see me . 
  i guess it 's a mentality thing but i would feel insecure living in something like that , and what about my dogs ? 
  they would just roam around neighborhood . 
  oh , so the next step is eu getting partitioned by its neighbors due to political decline ? 
  i just hope i will land in the equivalent of austrian galicia . 
  should n't have tried to illegaly invade the country . 
  borders are a thing . 
  good man , thanks based ottoman empire . 
  not `` dumb '' , but `` mute '' , as in your speech is so foreign and unlike slavic languages , we called you `` mutes '' . 
  because everything you read on the internet is true . 
  sas material right here . 
  how about some [ matrilineal marriage ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=kinga+duda&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjhgoq8_5rlahxehswkhzofdo4q_auibygb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965 ) instead ? 
  what 's the current rate for comments like these , seeing as ruble is in shambles ? 
  one can dream . 
  do n't worry , you will get there , you still got your deep dish chicago pizzas , saint patrick 's day when all the nation turns irish and whatnot so it 's all good , plenty of culture . 
  who is you ? 
  and what would you like to hear me pronounce ? 
  was n't the whole gist of your comments that the language evolves ? 
  seeing as i speak english , after all , and there is no governing body to standardize the language i have as much to say as anyone . 
  [ \u025bk.s\u025b\u027e.\u025a.\u0279\u0259 ] is considered a [ nonstandard pronunciation . 
  ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/et-cetera ) it seems your approach is to speak with enough authority for people to buy into your arguments . 
  you can stop this pointless chain of comments now , though . 
  yeah , except the second one makes you sound uneducated . 
   they have more right to what a standard should look like than you will ever have . 
  no need to be hostile , friend , 
  i do n't know . 
  quick google search led me to this quote :  when mexico sends its people , they 're not sending their best . 
  they 're not sending you . 
  they 're not sending you . 
  they 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with us . 
  they 're bringing drugs . 
  they 're bringing crime . 
  they 're rapists . 
  and some , i assume , are good people . 
  he puts so much emphasis on the last part , indicating that what he said previously about drug dealers and rapists is more true to him . 
  that statement , if not racist , is ignorant at best . 
  edit . 
  how about his desire to register every muslim in a database ? 
  fair enough . 
  so when does it stop being an error and become a norm . 
  can i still laugh at people pronouncing `` etcetera '' as `` ek setera '' ? 
  ( some weird mix between correct latin pronunciation and standard english one ), 
  you are much more articulate than i could ever be , very elegantly put . 
   the problem is you think there is perfection , and for some reason you think that native speakers are somehow mispronouncing things . 
  you do n't know better so you 're saying there is no standard british or american english accent ? 
  then there should totally be one , we could call it general american or something . 
  and how does that conflict with the link i posted . 
  i 'm not avoiding anything , i am not a native speaker . 
  i thought my flair was an obvious answer . 
   by your standards you most certainly do n't speak `` correctly '' anyway so you have to place even to be talking about what you think the standard should even be . 
  that 's the thing , my standards are high , but i also apply them to myself . 
  of course i 'm not pronouncing every word correctly , but for sure i 'm striving for perfection and trying to be indistinguishable from a native speaker , so do n't talk about my `` place '' . 
  i encourage correcting my grammar or pronunciation mistakes . 
  yes , let 's just pronounce everything willy-nilly since the language is evolving after all , no need for rules . 
  i do have an american accent though , and even when using american english the correct pronunciation [ is not eye-rack . 
  ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/iraq ), 
   i would n't know you are non-native from your writing here , well done . 
  aww , that 's the best compliment i could 've received , but i know i still have a long way to go , especially with pronunciation . 
  also i just feel like i 'm not utilizing your crazy tenses to their fullest and i ca n't express myself as freely as i would in polish yet . 
  thanks , you too . 
  yeah , officially since kinder-garden i was being taught british english with its pronunciation and writing rules . 
  but as i mentioned my `` proficiency '' does n't come from school , but as i would call it , osmosis , from interacting and immersing myself in the language , watching movies , reading books , browsing the internet . 
  british english just did n't take with me . 
  poland , so my accent and preference comes from your cultural victory and the media i consume , 
  i do n't even use or like british english , and have an american accent when speaking . 
  i think the problem is that you might be too sensitive . 
   it seems like you 're trying to turn a light-hearted jokey analysis of trump into a series reason not to vote for him . 
  not at all , i do n't care either way , and for sure do n't have a boner for sanders like reddit does . 
  it seems you are the one over analyzing my attempt at humor . 
  it does , thank you . 
  of course not , we call italy `` w\u0142ochy '' because of the celtic tribe of vlachs , now that 's super weird . 
  but in british english you already have a much better and closer pronunciation , why call it like apple product . 
  according to trump 's voters his main qualities are his sense of humor , honesty and not being as pc as his opponents . 
  that 's berlusconi in a nutshell . 
  as / r/soccer concluded he is an american berlusconi , only even more racist . 
  so before voting for him they should look at italy what happens when you elect the type . 
  still better than the american pronunciation of the name : eye-rack , ugh .
