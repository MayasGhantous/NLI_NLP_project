   `` nazi '' would be better . 
  it was n't `` germans '' , it were `` nazis '' that did that . 
  ah , the ancient tribe of nazis , dematerialized as swiftly as they appeared , truly a mysterious species . 
  how about being as precise when referencing german nazi death camps located in occupied poland ? 
  or does the same standard not apply ? 
  how dare you !, 
  so you do n't believe that an electrician that can barely speak one language could `` put an end to communism '' without any external influence ? 
   why did the poles vote for a nazi government then just now ? 
  why just now ? 
  we also voted for the original one so we could build some polish camps . 
   exhibitions and information was solely dedicated to saying `` it was n't the polish '' probably because often we get opinions like [ these . 
  ] ( http://www.jewishpost.com/viewpoints/my-trip-to-poland-the-reality-of-being-jewish.html )  today , poland is the only european country to have not officially recognized the existence of the holocaust , and most of it happened in poland !, 
  after so many years , the hatred still remains . 
  napoleon is my favorite italian . 
   stalin was a russian ? 
  that 's news . 
  stalin was the only culprit ? 
  that 's news , what a busy and efficient man . 
  then you and i agree in this matter , but it 's not like this elsewhere . 
  because as our friend goebbels said `` if you repeat a lie often enough , it becomes the truth . '', 
  because the whole issue is ignorant at best and straight up malicious at the worst . 
  holocaust denial is illegal in 16 countries . 
  i do n't see how mistaking a victim for perpetrator in this case is any different than that . 
  i also love the double standard . 
  everyone is very careful to call anything that had to do with germany and russia during ww ii `` nazi '' and `` soviet '' , but the same standard does n't apply to poland , and you can be as sloppy as you want because otherwise `` you are policing a language '' . 
  what pis has to do with any of that ? 
  are you saying they planted those document 's and then instructed kiszczak 's wife to try to sell them ? 
  i love how it 's always `` nazis '' and `` soviets '' , but the camps in reality were somehow polish , it 's amazing . 
  because glorious liberators 41-45 never forget , that 's why . 
  and also apparently being worked to death does n't count as a `` death camp '' . 
   i think poles are the only ones that assume there 's some implication of polish responsibility ( ... ) [ if only that were true . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agency_114#operations_to_whitewash_german_responsibility_for_world_war_ii ), 
  i would n't call 10-20 years to get rid off millions of people as a slow matter . 
  only because the war ended before nazi germany got to the `` good '' part of their generalplan ost . 
  that 's true , but implying that the germans did n't have plans ( [ generalplan ost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost ) ) to exterminate most of slavs is just as dishonest . 
  but they were [ put in camps , that 's the whole point ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_crimes_against_the_polish_nation#camps_and_ghettos ) , you did n't have to be a jew to land there . 
  about auschwitz :  franciszek piper , the chief historian of auschwitz , estimates that 140,000 to 150,000 non-jewish poles were brought to that camp between 1940 and 1945 , and that 70,000 to 75,000 died there as victims of executions , human experimentation , starvation and disease . 
  some , just 1/5th of a whole country , and that 's just poland . 
   yes , slavs were not exterminated the way the jews were . 
  haha , but they were . 
  from camps , to random killing to even medical experiments , just read up instead of spreading misinformation . 
  i do n't know if you are trolling , but they were not only sent to camps but , were just rounded and executed on the streets . 
  you have to realize that occupation in the east was nothing like that of the west . 
  and how is that one better considering poland had largest underground movement , were the 4th force in wwii , and fought on virtually every front ? 
  are you saying that they really murdered couple hundred thousand jews by themselves ? 
  that 's amazing . 
  it 's a reference to a polish [ poem and tongue twister . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chrz%c4%85szcz ) i recommend listening to it . 
   who like who thank you from the mountain for this comment . 
  and spain . 
  because people were unhappy with the previous retards that wasted their 8 years doing nothing so instead of voting for the 3rd party they elected pis again , it 's a retard merry-go-round . 
   beigli what beigli , that 's clearly a makowiec . 
  i was going to say the same thing . 
  the isometric angle makes it look like one . 
  what circlejerk ? 
  he invaded poland 16 days after hitler did . 
  how is that not an alliance ? 
  or are you one of those people that believe the war started in '41 and soviet russia liberated poland from the evil nazis ? 
  do n't they already do that ? 
  i do n't think he was a great painter , from what i 've seen from his works he struggled with basics , like perspective . 
  what ? 
  what exactly did you do in 1918 ? 
  and if you mean wwii , which has nothing to do with this day , then as much as i dislike russia it was won on the eastern front , you should lay off hollywood movies and pick up some books . 
  where does your apache ancestry comes into play ? 
  it is a thing . 
  we just do n't have the `` th '' sound , so people tend to replace the soft `` th '' with , as you said , `` f '' or hard `` th '' with `` d '' . 
  well , it was filmed there after all . 
  life imitating art and all that . 
  obviously should 've listened to my own advice of just tagging and ignoring . 
   it says a lot about you that you keep track about what other people excrete in internet forums ... that just saves time here when i see the same names spewing the same bullshit . 
  your comments though say way more about you than my tagging habits . 
  i do n't have to go back into your comments history to see things like . 
   [ so an eastern european women beater . 
  shocking !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51gn30/latvias_finance_minister_beats_the_womens_world/d7cfx0j )  [ yes , but poland has the good fortune to be neighbouring germany . 
  we tought you some manners over time !, 
  xp ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51aht4/ive_become_a_racist_migrant_wave_unleashes_danish/d7bav00 ) about gda\u0144sk . 
   [ what were they even doing there , in a german city , in the first place ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/50laxi/on_this_day_77_years_ago_hitler_invaded_poland/d75qbi7 ) ah yes , the classic polish camps joke . 
   [ does not really surprise me . 
  i mean just look at what happened in all those polish concentration camps ... what a horrible people ... xd ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ztff6/polish_soccer_fans_set_fire_to_jewish_effigies/d6ynw10 ) and that 's just last 2 weeks . 
  obviously those are all jokes , too bad you keep targeting the same group of people . 
  so you got some agenda going or some pole hurt you and now you are on crusade to `` mock poles '' . 
  i 'm out of this silly conversation . 
  it 's not the first comment of yours i 've seen `` mocking poles '' . 
   all the injustice and cruelties brought to `` them '' in history why the quotes ? 
  if you do n't see how things that happened to their grandparents ( but we do n't even have to go that far , it was mere 27 years age when the last soviet soldier left poland ) , things that shaped the country and have a lasting effect on their lives i do n't know what to tell you . 
   but obviously it 's an integral part of the polish nation . 
  obviously that 's another joke of yours , ah german humor . 
  edit . 
  obviously should 've listened to my own advice . 
   just tag and ignore . 
   the fuck are you on about ? 
  besides [ spreading propaganda and their anti-polish sentiment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/46diu9/calling_auschwitz_a_polish_death_camp_could_land/d04c7p3 ) , nothing . 
  just tag and ignore . 
  remember the bullshit documentaries and articles before euro 2012 about poland and ukraine ? 
  i remember sol campbell 's warning english to not come to poland or they `` could end up coming back in a coffin '' . 
  funny how the opposite seems to be more true . 
   why the biggest friends are the countries without common borders ? 
  but we used to have common border up until xviii century and were in personal union twice for a brief period of time in xiv and xv centuries . 
  of course the only truly italian pizza : hawaiian .
