he is against the integration policies of estonia and latvia , claiming they are `` apartheid policies '' . 
  on the whole , he ** does not recognize them as states . 
  ** wow , he really is something . 
  [ look at these not allies doing not ally things ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sko-upb6yo4 ), 
  not mentioned in the above list : - technological divide between western and russian forces - gdp equal to italy or california , and based on energy exports - no soft power , russia can influence some neighbors to join nato and that 's about it - no way to project military power globally - [ rubble ] ( http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=usdrub%3dx+interactive#%7b%22range%22%3a%223mo%22%2c%22scale%22%3a%22linear%22%2c%22comparisons%22%3a%7b%22eurrub%3dx%22%3a%7b%22color%22%3a%22%23cc0000%22%2c%22weight%22%3a1%7d%7d%7d ) sorry , having a nuke stash and being able to threaten one of your neighbors with `` independent rebels '' because they were n't in nato does n't make one a superpower . 
  i do n't think russiawillrise again : <, 
  cut it out with the fucking ominous big bad bear analogies already , russia is not a superpower anymore . 
   ok , so what 's the politically correct word of the month now ? 
  person of non-default coloration, 
  i 'm obviously extremely biased , but these people look much more sympathetic than the `` novorussia '' thugs . 
  strelkov looks like a mass murderer and givi looks dead inside - these guys , not so much . 
   we took back what was our no , wilno was not yours . 
  you do n't get to claim a city where your people actually do n't live and pretend it 's rightfuly yours over lousy `` historical importance '' . 
  once again , why not go for san francisco ? 
   forever ruined our relanshionship . 
  if this is how other lithuanians are , i could n't give a shit about our relationship . 
   it 's citizens on reddit unsenceraly remind us about this sensitive topic rather than moving on . 
  the fact that you took a polish city and resettled it with your kind is a sensitive topic to lithuanians ? 
  we should just pretend it never happened , because lithuanians may get hurt when reminded of their disgusting actions ? 
  really ? 
  by all means get offended , litwin , you ca n't change historical facts . 
  why take and colonise wilno then ? 
  well , probably because you ca n't claim cities over `` historical importance '' . 
  population is your best bet . 
  lithuania can into north america , go for it !, 
  i want to see you debate an american about san francisco being a rightful lithuanian city next , because it had a similiar amount of lithuanians to wilno in 1920, 
  like i 'd need your permission to visit wilno , 
  of course they will , the soviet `` legacy '' can only haunt them for so long, 
   deporting a few thousand landowners , speculators , and other trash to siberia this would be funny if you did n't sound so convinced about it , now it 's just sad . 
  but you took away russian ussr master race privileges , nazi !, 
  oh , it 's cultural , not genetic . 
  since ww2 , germans managed to turn hitler into an embarassing mistake . 
  russians managed to glorify stalin to the point where he 's the 3rd most beloved `` russian '' in the country . 
   i think the soviet era may have a lot more to do with any such tendencies . 
  yes , they were fed massive amounts of propaganda . 
  but then , so was everyone else in the eastern bloc , and guess what ? 
  no one had the same reaction . 
  russians are simply addicted to feeling that their country is `` strong '' ( and therefore agressive ) and care about that more than they care about such distractions like morality or human rights . 
  stalin was an absolute monster , but at least russia was ** strong ** back then !, 
  it 's true though . 
  `` charge of disloyalty '' , haha . 
  it 's going to be 25 years soon , and russia still ca n't accept that it does n't own an empire anymore . 
  no idea , but we totally accept more fast response troops as payment for saving yurop, 
  shut up dude , the sanctions totally cut off your head !, 
  well known western homosex propaganda site, 
   much bigger and more sinister empire . 
  haha, 
   * ioc members will be received with a smile on arrival at hotel will laughing in their faces also work ? 
   giving promises behind the backs of those whom they concern no , there were no promises given , because a conversation between two leaders does n't make a diplomatic agreement . 
  this was known by all parties carrying out the conversation , unless gorbachev had a stroke before attending , or something . 
   just because they 're not binding , does n't mean you 're not supposed to honor them . 
  that 's exactly what it means . 
  binding ( adjective ) : forcing or requiring someone to do something because of a promise , agreement , etc. 
  full definition of binding 1 : that binds 2 : imposing an obligation, 
   neither were the western actions . 
  really ? 
  12 independent nations requested to join a defensive alliance , and you feel accepting their requests and giving them protection was not `` moral and just '' ? 
  are they wrong because they do n't want to be a russian colony again ? 
   deal ( s ) were broken . 
  no , no deals were broken , because verbal agreements are not binding . 
  we 've been over this . 
   useless allies coming from a frenchman , this is pretty great . 
   not legally binding  consequences for breaking it that would kill the purpose of this thing we call `` diplomatic relations '' . 
  only real world consequences from this can be hurt russian feeligns - obviously russians are free to be hurt over any number of things , but if you 're implying there 's some justification for the invasion of ukraine , then that 's not true . 
   breaking of the agreement you might have been told this before , but verbal agreements are not binding . 
   and it does mean something . 
  actually , it just does n't . 
  sorry , i do n't make the rules of international diplomacy , and neither do you . 
  how does it feel , by the way ? 
  let 's ignore the ( very real ) treaties and agreements - the position you 're defending is that poland , hungary , czech republic , bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia , slovenia , albania , croatia ( and hopefully soon ukraine ) have no right to join a defensive alliance in order to get protected from their relatively recent occupier . 
  not very big about the whole `` morality '' thing , eh ? 
  well , perhaps i 'm not saying anything to `` the west '' because there was no such deal - an alleged verbal agreement means absolutely nothing , which was , i think , already explained to you in this thread . 
  even if we play your stupid game and pretend there really was some deal , it was obviously broken ( as it should ) , so why would i have any problems with the west again ? 
  the russophile whining over the fact that russia does n't get to keep nations that absolutely despise russia in its sphere of influence is cute , keep going . 
  my panslavic empire !, 
  love the french responses at the bottom of this thread . 
  they are definitely very ... french , 
  what deal would that be ? 
  because if you 're trying to say sanctioning russia did n't have polish approval , you 're being silly . 
   nato would not expand to russian borders . 
  you do n't get to tell us if we can or ca n't join a defensive alliance to guarantee our independence , serb . 
  oh shit , guilty . 
  from whom ? 
  because last time i checked god-emperor putin was n't at war with ukraine , or at all responsible for the crisis , 
  russia we war you, 
  i 'm not surprised - dzier\u017cy\u0144ski was lenin 's dog after all , and lenin was somehow successfully absolved by apologists . 
  if it 's okay to put lenin on a commie party poster in germany , nobody will give a damn if some police unit in russia is named after his lackey . 
  i would reconsider debating so much with this guy . 
  mrmysterious95 is pretty much the village idiot of / r/europe oh , and the eu has a huge approval in poland , yet you talk with him like his drivel represents some large part of polish public opinion . 
   all that is missing is a painting of jpii in the background and you being drunk and you would be a perfect caricature . 
  you sound irritated . 
  did your mobility scooter run out of battery on the way to mcdonalds today ? 
   possibly gay duh , it 's pretty obvious that with my blatant russophobia i must be a nazi homo zionist cia shill . 
  implying i care for any other pope than johannes paulus ii, 
   they just rarely had any power . 
  u wot m8 prepare your backside for a hussar charge, 
  pure blooded western space alien invader with his corrupting western tentacles, 
  then why should we bother ourselves with this disgusting display of evil western influence ? 
  at least we can still look back to the eariler , uncorrupted days of the russian empire . 
  to the ~ ~ proud slavic nation ~ ~ proud slavic ruler ivan the terrible , who was never cruel and dictatorial to anyone !,
