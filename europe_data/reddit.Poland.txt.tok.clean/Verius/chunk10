  i suppose there really is n't much to say until you actually press and read the links you 're regularly being provided munchie :\\ ^ ), 
  lol ok i kinda want to poke you enough so that we can start the mh17 shot down by ukrainian jets photoshop topic again but i 'm not sure if you can even say anything new about it, 
   your comment makes me smile and this is it no worries munchy , i 'm sure your comments here and in / r/russia make plenty of people smile too, 
  [ where are proofs ?? 
  i 'm left leaning and i absolutely will vote far right to deal with this , as much as it will hurt me to do so . 
  hope it does n't come to it . 
  that 's the only comment in defence of muh social justice you could produce , really ? 
   status quo warrior because being a `` status quo warrior '' conservative or being a deranged radical leftist are the only possible options , right :\\ ^ ), 
  what 's the deal with her crying on camera then ? 
  well fuck you too, 
  i 'm gon na assume this is bait, 
  [ you the fat one in a pink shirt , or ? 
  clearly germans hate democracy, 
  funny how it mostly seems to be self-hating germans, 
  a far left maniac walks into / r/europe and this is what happens , lol can you make up a nice strawman about me too , [ like you did here ? 
  ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d8fxc/stopbuyinggerman/ct2rkhu ) to give you some ammo , i disagree with mass imigration of culturally incompatible people into europe !, 
  righteous anger detected, 
  far leftist types really do n't want to see a welfare state that borrowed tons of money to keep up the welfare fail because then they would have to reconsider if their ideas are applicable to the real world , so they got ta boycott someone related , prefferably some * evil capitalist *, 
   `` sorry , but there is no way you are leaving this room , '' the former polish prime minister said .

  how long till i can get the turk out of my system ? 
  it 's been about 18 hours since my last kebab, 
   i have n't got time for that . 
  well luckily you 're turkish :\\ ^ ), 
  cultural relativism is idiotic bullshit that gets destroyed in the first or second chapter of an entry level ethics book, 
   i think russophobia is at the highest it 's been for a couple decades honestly i disagree , if we still define `` phobia '' as `` irrational fear '' then there 's not too much of that around . 
  negative feelings about russia are perfectly rational , they 're invading a country right now, 
  nobody 's gon na downvote you for that here man, 
  russians just modded the game to extend the end date . 
  those mods are pretty shitty though , it 's almost impossible to act like a * modern , civilized nation * because the mechanics are lacking . 
  explains some things , i guess . 
  so he 's about to drink himself to death i suppose ? 
   they are a dozen on / r / europe - mainly nationalist fanboys ukip 's primary islamophobic / r / european - and shout loudly , with brigading and multi . 
  does this dense frenchie actually believe that is the case ? 
   secular , modern-minded iranians i 've actually acquired most of my negativity towards islam by making iranian friends and learning how they feel about the * religion of peace * after experiencing it firsthand . 
  makes it even funnier when i sometimes get called a racist because i do n't support uncontrolled immigration :\\ ^ ), 
   really nice person you seem to be . 
  if a certain negativity towards people who are proving themselves again and again to be incompatible with secularism makes a person bad , then guess i 'm horrible :\\ ^ ) so you agree that free speech is good , but do n't like when someone actually uses it to challenge those who do n't want free speech ? 
  i do n't know man , i 'd rather have muslims hurt over and over again until they grow thicker skin and manage to control themselves like every other group . 
  just to be clear , i 'd propose the same treatment for christians if christian extremists were a problem . 
  the content of your first sentence was so fucking stupid that i decided to ignore it , sorry man . 
  there are things intended to specifically hurt pretty much every group you can imagine . 
  just name a group and i can probably find something that was made with the intent of hurting it , unless the group is extremely irrelevant and low key . 
  what are you trying to argue here , exactly ? 
  that everyone should be expect to throw a childish fit ( or commit a not-so-childish terrorist attack ) when `` offended '' or that muslims are the one a special protected group that can not control its butthurt ? 
  [ finn deathsquad will roll up to my house and behead me any second now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gm8pwot.jpg ), 
  the muslims you know are idiots then , since the `` do n't draw muhammad '' rule exists specifically to prevent him and other prophets being worshipped too hard by muslims and that 's clearly not the intention of people drawing muhammad fucking goats not that it matters , they have the right to be offended and everybody else has the right to do n't give a shit, 
  it 's been a while since i saw somebody freak out so hard because of a joke , please go take your pills now, 
  serbians confirmed as wildlings ? 
  so they 'll protect the realm against black walkers ? 
   do you think that being born in europe gives you a greater right to live here then others ? 
  lol what a silly idea !, 
  that 's a stonoga in poland as well , dude just got a silly name, 
   party with neo nazi tendencies had the vote of over 180,000 people in the 2014 parliamentary elections . 
  is n't that less ( percentage-wise ) than similar groups get in france or sweden all the time ? 
  i 'm glad someone 's citing [ reputable , unbiased sources , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wfvkhqh.png ) even on this homofascist subreddit filled with western propaganda, 
  [ nothing is impossible for russian propaganda ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/5445161/russia-accuses-poland-of-starting-second-world-war.html ), 
  i 'll be relieved when russia has no capacity to invade a single former puppet/ussr republic, 
   pew found that 61 per cent of russians believe there are parts of neighbouring countries that rightfully belong to russia . 
  fuck the former warsaw pact for getting into nato though , those paranoid russophobes :\\ ^ ), 
  i 'll take a 100 napoleons and any number of coins with them over a single russian , prussian or austrian,

   there is no evidence at all that anyone has died building world cup stadia . 
  bro , i 'm banned from / r/russia and i still downvoted you . 
  you had any respect for polygon ? 
  homonazis confirmed, 
  why do you bother man , do you expect him to debate a sick nationalist like you ? 
  / r/europe , where a leftist sjw mod and a serbian genocide denier mod simultaneously come under fire for their political agenda ( and more ) . 
  are n't we just the best , most reasonable community ? 
  i wish the modding reflected that, 
  i love how in the second leak they 're actually openly discussing the level of `` rightwingness '' that should be allowed in posts here  our job here is to facilitate the discussion which reflects the opinion of our user base ( even if we disagree with the sentiment [ ... ] ) if all the mods dream of some far-left circlejerk and the userbase does n't reflect that whatsoever , maybe they should n't mod the subreddit ? 
  i liked this palce because most users seem to have reasonable moderate left worldviews , meanwhile the mods have already tried to put fucking cultural relativism and a `` russophobia '' ban into the official rules . 
  it seems like their vision of / r/europe would be / u/zyllber talking to himself about marx . 
  yes , you should . 
  i have also said a lot of other thing in that post . 
  is the mental capacity of the typical pro-russian belarussian such that it only allows to concentrate on one topic at a time ? 
  today it 's the second time you 're dropping 70 % of the conversation because some part of my post personally touched you in a wrong way . 
  the quality of your replies has now degenerated to the level i used to get from drunk russians screaming suka blyat in online video games . 
  you might want to calm down before you seriously hurt yourself in some way . 
  and you could stand to learn compassion , some of your very own countrymen suffer because they 're not as happy and willing to get brainwashed and pretend everything is fine in their little russian puppet state . 
  you should ' t hate them , bud . 
  were n't you supposed to be out of here by now ? 
  do n't you have some russian boots to clean ? 
  at least stay true to what you write , buddy . 
  this entire post reads like something a north korean would write while desperately trying to avoid getting shot by his government for not loving the motherland enough . 
  relax . 
  i think that would be too much even for russia and its puppets , for now . 
  funny how all the white-red-white oriented `` clowns '' i 've ever known were much more smarter and nicer than you happen to be . 
  the division in belarus is so visibly real . 
  oh well , your kind will be left behind , 
   there is nothing except emotions behind this interest . 
  should people not be emotional about a hostile country near their borders that 's actively rewriting it 's horrible history to justify previous invasions ? 
   your obvious display was n't obvious at all . 
  i have provided you with a picture displayed in russian state tv that is falsified beyond all possible doubts . 
  it 's fake on multiple different levels . 
  i have mentioned 2 of them so far ( the fact that the plane is from google graphics and the base satellite image is from old google maps ) for the sake of simplicity . 
  now , if you do n't believe me , it would be your turn to do research , so head [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=russia+mh17+fake+satellite&amp;oq=russia+mh17+fake+satellite&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4682j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 ) and press one of the links , or do a similar search . 
  otherwise , turning around and saying that you fully believe in putin 's media despite being presented with this case means you give up . 
  i can not make this any more obvious for you . 
  i can not force you to do research .
