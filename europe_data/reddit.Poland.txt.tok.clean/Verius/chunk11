  i can not force you to process facts in a logical way . 
  if you chose to believe in this picture despite everything that was shown to you so far , then the problem lies with you and your blind belief in russian media . 
  there is nothing i could 've changed . 
   we in belarus have chosen the right direction to the east . 
  you do n't choose anything in belarus , lukashenko does , and he is not nearly as blindly devoted to russia as you are . 
  your country is n't as blindly devoted to russia as you are , too . 
  white-red-white makes a pretty flag , do n't you think  ? 
  i used to be much , much less patient before i started posting on / r/russia and replying to their shitposts here . 
  it 's a therapeutic experience now, 
  you 're acting as the [ mouth of sauron ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/x2ii4blir28/maxresdefault.jpg ) right now . 
  what argument would you like to see ? 
  you present your strange lack of understanding as to why europeans are interested in russian state tv spreading lies , i tell you why it 's perfectly reasonable to be interested in that . 
  you exclaim your full absolute belief in the lack of propaganda in russian tv , i show you the biggest display of obvious lies shown on russian tv so far in relation to the ukrainian crisis ( even though you chose to willingly stay ignorant ) . 
  if you think something could 've been done better on my part in this conversation , please let me know and explain , 
   sure i do and yes . 
  well then , congratulations . 
  even most of / r/russia gave up on defending that one and tried to act as if \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b showed the image as a mistake , not to spread misinformation . 
  but you might be the actual target audience of such actions . 
   lol , looked you post history . 
  anything in particular got your attention :\\ ^ ) ? 
  i looked at your post history as well but it was pretty bland for a prorussian poster . 
   why do you talk to me ? ), 
  why would i not ? 
  you are presenting wrong arguments and you 're absolutely unable to defend them . 
  i like that kind of people if they 're trying to represent the `` opposite side '' :\\ ^ ), 
   i can say that i totally believe in what russia says on that topic . 
  that would make you an absolute moron . 
  let 's give you a chance though because i refuse to believe anyone with internet access would be that stupid . 
  let me phrase this as a yes/no question : do you believe [ this picture , ] ( http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4631728.ece/alternates/s1023/flight-mh17-satellite-main.jpg ) presented by piervyj kanal as a proof of ukrainian responsibility for mh17 , is valid , believable , and not a part of russian misinformation campaign ? 
  before you reply , please consider that the plane in the `` satellite image '' [ used to be the first thing that comes up in google graphics ] ( http://vi.ill.in.ua/m/950x0/893837.jpg?t=635518220347609095 ) when you search for \u0431\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0443 ( it 's not even the same boeing model as mh17 ) , including a part of the left wing being cut out because it was n't in the original pic . 
  if you answer `` yes '' , that will be willing ignorance on a scale i have n't seen before . 
   russia is n't invading ukraine lol get with the times buddy , i think you 're supposed to move on from denial to `` damn right we 're liberating novorosija from western nazis !! '', 
  looking at your posting history , you seem to already fully accept that everyone to the west of belarus is a nazi , so it should come to you easily . 
   russian tv does n't carrying massive propaganda . 
   russian state tv rossija 1 defended 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia pick one of the above . 
  i could literally sit here all day and link examples of russian state tv presenting extreme and obvious disinformation [ ( remember the fucking `` satellite images '' of mh17 being strafed by ukr jets , shopped straight from old google maps , shown on russian state tv ? 
  ) ] ( http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4631728.ece/alternates/s1023/flight-mh17-satellite-main.jpg ) and i would n't be done by dinner . 
  lucky for you and me , i have other things to do . 
   ttip , greece , migration , islamism , problems of the economy and many other things . 
  you seriously do n't see how russia is a larger issue than a majority of those topics ? 
  i really ca n't help you in that case . 
  i have absolutely no idea what kind of logic could produce this point of view russia is a partially european nation currently invading another european country while carrying out a massive propaganda campaign on its population , largely through its state media . 
  if the latest piece of misinformation this state media managed to produce is an `` useless and pointless '' thing to discuss , then i 'd like to know what you consider an useful and valuable thing to discuss , for europeans . 
  go ahead , tell me !, 
  like it or not , what is currently being done to the russian people by their own government is one of the most important things to dicuss this year , not the opposite . 
  how are you surprised ? 
  is it weird to discuss the horrible brainwashing currently carried out on the russian people by their state media ? 
  do you seriously not see how it is a reasonable concern and topic of discussion for europeans ? 
  right , and we can ridicule russian state tv for producing this kind of bullshit and shoveling it down willing russian throats . 
  why do you see a problem with that , did we break any russian laws :\\ ^ ) ? 
   `` the great patriotic war '' a.k.a. 
  `` world war ii '' ? 
  `` world war ii minus the part where we invaded a bunch of places '', 
  not limiting ourselves to german cars anymore, 
   in this case , abortions should be unconditionally allowed . 
  living person decides , right ? 
  i absolutely agree !, 
  you see , i never said that i agree with everything duda wants to do , or even most of what he wants to do . 
  damn , i never even said i 'm happy to see him elected . 
  but back then , you compared the guy to some monster for what i think is the reasonable choice at this time and place . 
  now , if we had the economic position of successful western european countries and he was still against invitro , that would change things a lot . 
  he probably would , but that 's irrelevant . 
  there 's a lot of other things you could hate him for that are not hypothetical , like his stance on abortion . 
   you 're either trolling or stupid . 
  let 's assume the second , because arguing with the first makes even less sense . 
  let 's repeat once again : was joek m8, 
  denying in vitro treatment from public health fund means effectively denying in vitro for many . 
  yes . 
  i 'm sorry they were born in a poor country . 
  shit , so was i. 
   this argument is invalid , because it has no natural limits of applicability . 
  the argument is absolutely valid because there 's a fundamental difference between paying to create new life and paying to save/support already existing life . 
  unborn children do n't take priority over living people . 
  if you do n't see it , and how it effectively limits the argument , i really ca n't help you . 
  but usually you are . 
  well , i learn something new about myself everyday . 
  if the next time i have the chance i tell the sick and the poor to fuck themselves because we need to bring more invitro children into this messed up country , can i get my leftist card back ? 
   unfortunately i 'll have to pay for this too , because all eu citizens have equal medical care rights in all eu member states , and additionally to polish women visiting czech republic for abortions , there will be polish women visiting czech republic for impregnation . 
  if you think that 's a bad thing and your country is n't able to financially support such procedures , maybe you should vote for someone who will stop financing them from public money :\\ ^ ) . 
  otherwise i do n't see how you could complain . 
  m8 , what ? 
  not financing extremely expensive procedures publicly is comparable with flaying someone alive ? 
  are you in some invitro cult ? 
   infertility treatment is very expensive . 
  i know pairs that spend a good fortune on this . 
  yes , it is . 
  it 's like you get it , but you do n't . 
  newsflash : poland is fucking poor . 
  you do n't have to be a psycho anti-technology right wing crusader to see how the money could be spent better . 
  i feel for people who fight infertility . 
  i also happen to feel for people who already live in poverty in this mess quite a lot more . 
  why should you not ? 
  oh , it 's the village idiot of / r/europe , i did n't notice . 
  move along . 
  but where are proofs ? 
  [ where proofs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jd2rcnn.png ), 
   there would be no poland and no poles . 
  and who knows what else , if lenin could cross to defenceless germany and france, 
  haha, 
  sure , the hungarians should just press that big red button that instantly fixes decades of communist occupation and brings them to western european levels , so that they can finally give the refugees a welfare state they deserve .
