  nothing makes me rethink my generally leftist views like other leftits . 
  people are fucked in the head , man, 
  whynotboth.jpg it 's from erasmus , but i also do n't get any other sort of loan/grant , so ... : <, 
   it 's a set of values . 
  well , about them `` values '' of immigrants ... 
  150 $ here , what the fuck, 
   avoiding their responsibility our fucking what ? 
  yes , but just a couple orders of magnitude less of them . 
  small detail . 
  \\  i do n't get insulted by comments like yours . 
  \\  writes an emotional rant about muh beautiful french countryside i do n't know man ... 
  so what 's your bmi brother : ^ ), 
  [ dat dere ] ( http://static.gamelux.nl/storage/images/photos/edf/a0d/10226_original.jpg ), 
  watch out man , cultural relativism is right there in the new rules of this sub : ^ ), 
   does it mean that sweden is ruined ? 
  you can ask / r/european about it, 
  i 've felt nothing but disgust towards their government since i found out their foreign minister is an old communist piece of shit who openly endorsed the supression of polish independence movements . 
  their dealing with russia did n't help at all . 
  i wo n't comment on their economic policy because i 'm clearly very biased and i do n't want any greeks to give me lectures about austerity . 
   other feels good that they escaped from the soviets , cancelled their industry and now are toilet cleaners of europe  i 'm expecting a normal discussion . 
  haha , that 's not how it works , fuck you, 
  i 'm honestly considering going back to firefox , chrome 's been getting worse and worse for me . 
  i already use it for facebook and youtube because they keep freezing my pc in chrome , just need to gather some motivation to set up all the addons and settings i need for the full switch, 
  let me just ask , are you the austrian leftist who one time claimed that communist occupation was a positive thing for latvia because it `` created economic growth impossible under capitalism '' ? 
  if it 's you , congratulations , it 's still the dumbest thing i ever read . 
   the eu should n't demand it why ? 
  this is such a fucking strange thing to oppose . 
  are you against calorie labels on food ? 
  edit : and by `` food '' i mean `` other sources of energy that can be used by humans '', 
   my main point is that people know how to drink alcohol and do n't need to be educated with warning labels . 
  guess what , i agree . 
  however , since calorie labels are not warning labels , i do n't see how that 's connected . 
  calories are just units of energy , man . 
   and if you are health obsessed you can find all the information you need online . 
  or i could find all the information i need on a tiny calorie content label on my bottle , just like i do for everything else i eat or drink . 
  so you can only not consume alcohol at all , or be an alcoholic ? 
  so the only people who can make use of calorie labels are bodybuilder , like arnold or coleman ? 
  not that it matters , because above i 've just posted a picture of a [ bodybuilder/pt/fitness guru ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dtawqzv6d7m/s6f7xk71z7i/aaaaaaaaaka/-dg_sxvnpfc/s1600-h/dsc00316.jpg ) who admits to binge drinking all the time . 
  you 've now seen an `` alcoholic '' bodybuilder . 
  here 's a [ reading for you on the actual effect of alcohol . 
  ] ( http://www.leangains.com/2010/07/truth-about-alcohol-fat-loss-and-muscle.html ) you really wo n't be able to make a good point here , because you 're just wrong . 
  drinking alcohol does not a make a fit lifestyle impossible , calorie labels on alcohol are objectively a convenient , good thing . 
   i am not health obsessed . 
  of course you 're not , your ignorance in health matters shows that very well . 
  yeah when you get them in cans like me :d, 
  so you need to drink a bottle of vodka a day to possibly make use of calorie labels ? 
  i really do n't know where you 're going with this logic man, 
  money 's tight so i 'm very rarely at restaurants ( pls gib bitcoin ) processed ? 
  i 'm in germany and absolutely everything except for alcohol has its calorie content shown, 
   nobody who cares about their body drinks lots of alcohol [ tfw tonight , after my workout and a quick shower , i 'm going to get smashed on vodka with the most dedicated fitness chick in our entire gym ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5298/5523482703_1e33825d32.jpg ) really bro , take your misconceptions about alcohol somewhere else ( to some straight edge ~ ~ circlejerk ~ ~ community ? 
  ) , the actual negative effect of getting wasted once in a while is a negligible , short-term decrease in testosterone levels , and that 's about it . 
  oh , and ** you have to guess the calories because there 's no labels . 
   if you drink much alcohol your problem is n't likely to be calories . 
  according to ? 
  i drink `` much alcohol '' , i also religiously count calories both for bulking and cutting and alcohol is the only area where i have to either guess or get my info from weird webpages ( and each one of them gives you different numbers ) . 
  this is really where you decided to make your libertarian stand ? 
  small , informative , useful labels on something that clearly wo n't even affect you ? 
  so what is supposed to be the argentinian claim to the falklands ? 
  `` we owned the place for like a year in 1830s , give back our rightful clay '' ? 
  an example of the elusive [ `` zmiana '' ] ( http://partia-zmiana.pl/biography/ ) electorate ? 
  ussr was russian empire 2.0 , obviously it was pretty bad for russians when it finally fell apart . 
  tough shit , maybe russians should n't have depended on a bunch of occupied nations and puppet states that absolutely hated them . 
  you know , the german loss in ww2 was pretty bad for many germans at the time , but you would n't be arguing that it was n't a good thing , would you ? 
  that 's a lot of conviction for a moron who ca n't tell if ravensbr\u00fcck is in poland or germany . 
  have a shitty day . 
  it wo n't change the fact that you still hold this idiotic opinion about poland, 
  master troler or are you that stupid ? 
  dude 's comment was  the poles were and are extremely anti-semitic . 
   this is not an accident ca n't escape the shame !, 
  mods censor things here all the time , i believe most threads about muslim migrants drowning christian migrants were quietly deleted, 
  sorry man , but it is a bit sickening that you 're now conditioned to jump to `` evil european colonisation '' as soon as you see `` place outside of europe '' and `` christianity '' in the same sentence . 
  social justice !, 
  disclaimer : after writing all this , i realized that you might not have been in sound mental health while replying . 
  just so you know - if you want to delete this mess of a post from above , calm down and answer what i actually wrote , not some imagined manifesto where i claim to hate all russians and consider them subhuman animals , go ahead . 
  i think that could only improve the discussion . 
  but in case you ca n't or do n't want to keep your victim complex under control , here we go :  first of all , there is no ` god_emperor ' in russia , do n't confuse us with poland . 
  no jokes allowed in soviet russia , got it . 
   secondly , the idea of that video was that ` russian occupation ' was n't entirely negative for the region , and had its positive sides , which is completely true . 
  we bring many factory and car for uncivilized balt i wo n't argue history with you , this post will be long enough as it is . 
  clearly you 're one of the russians who think balts do n't have the capacity to build factories by themselves . 
  why is russian occupation in quotes ? 
  still going by that kremlin narrative where they willingly joined you or something ? 
   have n't even experienced yourself i need to be personally deported to syberia by the nkvd or i 'm not allowed to feel what my grandmother felt . 
  i need to be personally starved to death by russians in prison or i 'm not allowed to feel what my grand-grandfather felt ( this one might be hard ) . 
  good to know . 
   justify your hatred towards an entire nation  and last but not least , people in russia are all individual people with different views and opinions . 
  okay , this is going to be the key here . 
  both my post specifically adressed the crazy bunch of ussr apologists on / r/russia , not the entire nation , and i think that would be perfectly clear to a person with average reading comprehension skills . 
  are you projecting ? 
  replying to what you wish i wrote , not what i did ? 
  while certain data , like putin 's approval rating or stalin 's recent popularity , give a quite * unsettling * view of the nation in general , that is beyond this discussion . 
  believe it or not , i have some russian friends/acquaintances , they just happen not to be ussr apologists , at least not when i 'm around . 
  i also know a russian who told me my grandmother probably deserved to be sent to syberia at 11 years old , that guy does belong to the group i hate . 
  see the difference ? 
   you still feel some sort of anger towards me just becuase i 'm russian and because i love my country and am proud of its history then it speaks volumes about you , not me . 
  no , it speaks only about you . 
  i do n't feel anger towards you because you 're russian . 
  i feel anger towards you because of your attitude towards your history . 
  i 'll be frank here because this is not your / r/russia hugbox , sorry : your history is horrible . 
  russia brought insane amounts of suffering both abroad and to it 's own citizens .
