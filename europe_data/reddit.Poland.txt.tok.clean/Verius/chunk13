  you 're not supposed to be proud of it and you 're definitely not supposed to try convincing your victims that you were n't that bad , or , fucking hell , that you were actually good for them . 
  if you ca n't meet that last standard , then yes , you 're going to get some anger . 
  germans , who also carried out terrible crimes , are not proud of their dark history , while you are still trying to be . 
  german kids get mandatory trips to auschwitz , while apparently russia just shut down the last gulag museum , and i know the people i speak about do n't see much wrong with it . 
  and that 's why it 's perfectly fine for me to have all the anger i want towards your apologists . 
  thank you for this additional insight on how the target audience of `` i am a russian occupant '' thinks , by the way . 
  were you somehow conditioned to try seeing `` russophobia '' everywhere , or is that just where you arrived by yourself ? 
   what it will cost poland ( minus one cent ) will they really do that ? 
  buying from russia comes with the additional undesirable effect of giving money to russia , so if russian price is barely better ... 
  all the attempts to convince victims of communism , especially the poor balts , that their feelings about russian occupation are wrong and a result of some `` russophobia '' , because the occupation was actually positive for them ? 
  it comes up every so often , for example the bit about baltics from that idiotic `` i am a russian occupant '' video was well received on / r/russia . 
  i mean , now that we have this quote from the god-emperor of russia , those arguments will stop , right ? 
  lol, 
  i expect all the * soviet union was actually great for you , you ungrateful fucks we give many factory and car * / r/russia warriors will apologize now ? 
  you tried, 
  \\  problem muslims power \\  political care reason putin, 
  `` russia is fighting a war of resistance that began in 1991 , when the ussr 's collapse left former soviet republics as colonies of the united states . '', 
  it 's so hard to accept that this is actually what some russians believe . 
  entire thing reads like a typical / r/newrussia post, 
  if it 's acceptable for germans to ban openly nazi organisations ( debatable ) , then it 's definitely acceptable for victims of communism to ban communist organizations . 
  since the precedent is already set , well , nothing wrong with banning them now . 
  `` polish people voted for communism after ww2 '' and lots of other alternative history from a certain well known genocidal / r/russia poster it was a lot of fun before i finally got banned, 
  yes , apparently , and according to this definition `` bigotry is a state of mind where a person obstinately , irrationally , unfairly or intolerantly dislikes other people , ideas '' it 's a completely subjective term , which makes for a damn poor rule when applied to politics . 
  obviously most of / r/russia [ considers things said in this subreddit `` bigoted '' or `` russophobic '' ] ( http://pl.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/31bift/reurope_included_russophobia_in_their_new_rules/ ) while i think most opinions about russia presented in / r/europe are perfectly rational and fair , influenced by well documented events , and therefore have nothing to do with bigotry or `` russophobia '' . 
  what point were you trying to make with this post , anyway ? 
  i do n't think `` irrational fear '' is really possible in case of russia , and that 's what a `` phobia '' is . 
  watch out for that `` russophobia '' mate , we have some cool new rules here, 
  poland is so damn privileged compared to these noble japanese savages, 
  oh , so it 's our cultures keeping us away from the `` first world '' , not decades of commie occupation, 
   that 's obviously bullshit , because bismarck 's foreign policy directive was that of a saturated germany : no expansion , no colonies , no ` lebensraum ' but a healthy dose of cleansing the `` german '' lands from poles , right ? 
  i mean , you ca n't saturate `` your '' lands if they 're full of someone else . 
   but sure , let 's try misattributing some bismarck quotes . 
  you know damn right i did n't mean those quotes . 
  here , let 's try misattributing this one :  hit the poles so hard that they despair of their life ; i have full sympathy with their condition , but if we want to survive , we can only exterminate them ; the wolf , too , can not help having been created by god as he is , but people shoot him for it if they can . 
  what a great leader    he united the country   stick your `` good '' chancellor and your denial up your ass, 
   should we tear down statues of teddy roosevelt ? 
  i do n't actually know what was it that roosevelt said - if he was as bad as you paint him to be ( as bad as bismarck ) then by all means , tear them down, 
   we like to act better today because of present-ism why do we hate hitler then ? 
  it 's not like the timeframe between those two is very big . 
  you 're not making an excuse for bismarck here . 
   i am not going to compare him to hitler at all . 
  both were trying to get rid of the original population of the lands to the east of germany to `` secure the future for their race '' and i do n't think their actual victims would see a difference . 
  well , it 's not like some american 's denial matters to me . 
  please . 
  you could attribute all those bismarck quotes to hitler instead - no one would notice the change , everyone would then agree that hitler was a horrible , evil monster . 
  how could he say these things ?!, 
  i guess germans desperately want some sort of positive figure in their history , and will glorify a piece of shit for it . 
   the germans have the done the absolute most to confront their historical past ignore the multiple germans defending their mini-hitler in this very thread, 
  speaking about denial , i believe that we had an argument about statististics , studies and all that fun stuff that you abandoned yesterday . 
  come on and make my second evening in a row :d, 
  he 's apparently my personal putinbot . 
  i get in tons of arguments that could get me one but i still suspect trolling , hopefully no one is that crazy . 
  pretty amusing though :d, 
   random toothless pro-polish so random that you decided to make an account just to follow me around and post `` we hev nukes fear us blyet polend ) ) ) ) we come for u better learn russian we eradicate u '' , oh so random  defending from what ? 
  you still have to tell me how you feel about the way the [ miserable shithole you call a `` country '' is presented ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/3089z5/the_wrong_side_of_history/ ) on / r/polandball , your `` favorite subreddit '' , do n't remember ? 
  and from the `` american masters '' part i suppose you really are that conspiratard from worldnews . 
  awesome !, 
  i was sure this account is a friend of mine trolling , not an actual russian avenger . 
  zhirinovsky pls go on the other hand you 're free to come back to the post you ran away from ~ ~ yesterday ~ ~ two days ago , show some balls when you defend your glorious motherland online !, 
   lol typical sjw oy vey , the goyim know who i am now , shut it down  sample size means nothing if you do n't know where the people came from . 
  what if the sample was from a study abroad program , where only students around the same age who 've studied in other countries participated . 
  or the people were all from a village on the outskirts of poznan ? 
  obviously where the people you are surveying are from is important . 
  ah , of course , so now you suspect the sample was collected inappropriately ( you have no reason to , the study was conducted by professionals , those are not the people you need to teach how to take samples and to avoid polling a single village ) , and `` sample size means nothing '' . 
  what is this then :  the sample size is one of the most important things in a scientific study . 
   a sample of about 1,000 people conducted 17 years ago is not `` proof '' . 
   first of all , the `` study '' , has such a small sample size why were you complaining about the sample size in 3 separate posts ? 
  obviously , if the sample is inappropriate , a larger sample wo n't change a thing , hell , the result would get even worse ( until your sample grows to the point where you poll like half of the country , but that 's not realistic and exactly the reason why we use statistics ) . 
  but if the sample was correct , a sample size of  1100 is absolutely fine , as i explained above ... could it be that , again , ** you do not understand statistics ** and should probably quit trying to judge professional scientific studies ? 
  keep digging yourself into a deeper hole , you dense motherfucker , you 're pretty amusing . 
  you lack ( absolutely basic ) understanding of statistics . 
  sample sizes do n't work like you think they do , or like you want them to . 
  for a population of 38 million , sample of over 1067 is appropriate for a study with 95 % confidence level and confidence interval of 3 ( for the record , it would be appropriate for a much larger population , too ) but i do n't expect you to know what those terms mean , do n't worry . 
  if you 're able to use google , you can stop making a complete fool out of yourself and do some basic research . 
  i suggest you [ start here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sample_size_determination ) or simply look for a sample size calculator if you prefer to skip those tough , sciency parts , which is what i expect a / r/european poster to do , 
   the `` study '' , has such a small sample size ah yes , complaining about the sample size , the first and most obvious sign of someone with no understanding of statistics trying to speak about statistics !, 
  this is your brain on russian propaganda, 
  only if [ he 's the successor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_zhirinovsky ), 
  zhirinovsky pls go on the other hand you 're free to come back to the [ post you ran away from yesterday ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30cuip/tartu_estonia_commemorating_the_march_deportation/cptr5fm ) , show some balls when you defend your glorious motherland online !, 
  he 's europe-kin, 
  somehow i ticked off `` show my flair on this subreddit '' , my bad . 
  zhirinovsky , is that you ? 
  i guess people on your level represent the electorate of that brilliant diplomat xd ? 
  nothing to add about your secret / r/polandball club ? 
  nothing to say about the way your motherland is represented there  ? 
   but i can link you plenty of those daily posts since i 'm a fairly regular reader of polandball anyway , that would be a waste of your time and i 'm sure you have other precious uses for it , like defending * rossiya * on the internet  shit on your country pretty exclusively i prefer the ones that capture the [ misery of being russian , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/3089z5/the_wrong_side_of_history/ ) to be honest   do n't worry , soon you may possibly find yourself in scenario where learning russian will be the only way to live a decent life . 
  we will see how badly you bark by then . 
  now that 's a russia stronk moment , i ca n't wait !, 
  will those [ incredibly underwhelming ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/russia-unveil-robot-army-arms-expo-316982 ) battle ~ ~ puppets ~ ~ robots carry out this conquest , or should i expect the boring , usual russian `` horde of conscripts catching bullets '' strategy ? 
  this is great xd i do n't know what i did to deserve a personal vata to follow my posts and cry about russophobia , but i 'm honored !, 
   polandball is my favourite subreddit sure , but i do n't think the feeling is mutual , you write like a 14 years old and / r/polandball is generally a pretty smart subreddit :d  \u041a\u0430\u0442\u044b\u043d\u044c  \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a pls civilized languages only i hope to see more of you , do you have a name ? 
  lol what is this account if you 're [ that butthurt conspiratard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qvicz1s.png ) from / r/worldnews couple days back ( similiar name i guess ? ), 
  then do n't worry , you 're in much worse mental condition than any aspie xd, 
  lol i 'm already in germany anyway, 
   when it 's talking about autistic people i 'm bff with this one aspie , meaning it 's fine for me to to say all kinds of offensive shit now . 
  you know , just like having black friends unlocks the infinite potential of `` nigga '' to white people . 
   shame stalin did n't kill all of ya , huh ? 
  putin is the best < 3 topkek, 
  it was * a joke * you goddamn autist . 
  we reached some sort of consensus one post back , but apparently it takes one joke to set you back into the default `` martyr syndrome lol ` genocide ' of poles '' .
