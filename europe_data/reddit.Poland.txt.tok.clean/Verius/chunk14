  you forgot to mention generalplan ost and that you 're a liberal , as in [ those guidelines . 
  ] ( http://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30cuip/tartu_estonia_commemorating_the_march_deportation/cprlzqw ) ( but it 's impressive how you produce those posts in ~ 4 minutes ), 
   where is my victim status ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned , you can join the martyr club anytime , just sign on this form here that you accept stalin and the ussr as the ultimate evil in the known universe , 
   but that 's not how i was taught . 
  i will use the definition provided by globally ratified un convention over the definition of some random russian with a mission to convince / r/europe that poles did n't have it too bad under ussr who ca n't actually state what his definition is in any of his extremely lengthy posts , thank you . 
   isolated scholars if you bothered to press one of the links provided , you 'd see the `` isolated scholar '' is the `` director of the genocide studies program '' at an ivy league university ( should i really tell you what yale is ? ), 
  and `` also published prize-winning work on the global history of genocide . '', 
  and again , sorry but i 'm going to trust him over you . 
   genocide is n't about the pure metrics , it 's about the aim . 
  glad we 're in agreement , you should have no problems accepting that an operation aiming to kill `` absolutely all poles '' in ussr is a genocide . 
  i have a feeling you still have n't actually read on what the polish operation was , or you 're in denial . 
  if you do n't agree , then i 'm really not sure which `` conditions '' of genocide are not fulfilled by the polish operation according to your definition , seriously . 
   i suppose stalin wanted to genocide russians if stalin issued an order to kill `` absolutely all russians '' , just like he did for poles , then that would be true , yes . 
  genocide is defined as [ `` any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such : ( a ) killing members of the group ; ( b ) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; ( c ) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ; ( d ) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; ( e ) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . '' ] ( http://www.britannica.com/ebchecked/topic/229236/genocide ) . 
  explain how [ this event ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_%281937%e2%80%9338%29 ) does n't fit this definition of genocide . 
   otherwise the word genocide is literally cheapened if target murder of 100000 people does n't fit your definition of genocide somehow , the world is absolutely useless anyway  i am very sorry for it but there is n't a single academic of history who will call it genocide . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  do you not recognize [ an expert on genocide from yale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ben_kiernan ) as an academic ? 
  the polish operation is right there in his [ book about , you know , genocides . 
  ] ( http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-regional-history/specter-genocide-mass-murder-historical-perspective ) you 're free to familiarize yourself with the sources [ to the page i provided to you multiple times ] that you 've been refusing to read by now , apparently . 
  you 'll find it has plenty of sources , and not just polish ones . 
  the soviet operation was a genocide of the polish people by the ussr . 
   edit : i saw the instant downvote a second after posting , why do n't you cry some more ? 
  wo n't change history though . 
  the next time i can downvote you after i finish writing the reply , if that makes you feel better . 
   they reflect a different viewpoint from that of yours perhaps , maybe influenced by the country of education perhaps . 
  i take it you have a ba in history as well ? 
  what country ? 
  did your ba in history influence the decision to write `` please refrain from cheapening the holocaust and other genocides by saying there was a genocide of the poles '' ( which is the most disgusting comment i 've seen on this subreddit ) in direct response to a [ link about a genocide of poles ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_%281937%e2%80%9338%29 ) this is the 3rd time i 'm trying to get you to adress this . 
  the user above is right , you type in 10 untruths and hope some of them stick . 
  you mean , just like russians hopelessly [ try to convince each other that latvians are literally hitler ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/2z8qwl/ ) i 'm not longer quite sure which side you 're on . 
   that 's why you may lose your independence in the future . 
  because of not trying to be bffs with hostile russia , really ? 
  serbia strong xd, 
  because you failed to reply last night ( surprise ) i 'm going to ask you again to explain how [ targeted murder of 100000 poles for nothing else than being polish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_%281937%e2%80%9338%29 ) does n't count as genocide of poles as per this quote of yours :  i knew some smartass would say that about polish genocide , but please refrain from cheapening the holocaust and other genocides by saying there was a genocide of the poles . 
  this is the second time i see this from you on / r/europe - you write those long , long posts on how the poles were bad , insert some complete ahistoric horseshit into them ( last time it was [ `` most of the land seized in kresy was n't polish anyway '' which is something you curiously never managed to adress in our entire conversation ] ( http://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xsaiv/russias_gulag_museum_shuts_doors_amid_mounting/cp3exkn ) , this time it 's `` do n't cheapen the holocaust by getting mass murdered '' ) , then , when called out on the horseshit you continue your novella writing on semi-related topics and pretend nobody noticed . 
  is this something you do consciously , to spread misinformation ? 
  you definitely have knowledge of history , yet from time to time , you just bring out horseshit and start acting like it 's a fact . 
   i knew some smartass would say that about polish genocide , but please refrain from cheapening the holocaust and other genocides by saying there was a genocide of the poles . 
  you 've just been provided a link about the polish operation where over 100000 people were rounded up and executed because they had polish sounding names in the phonebook . 
  stalin was quoted saying `` keep on digging out and cleaning out this polish filth '' . 
  and yet , this is your answer ? 
  sucks being polish , ca n't even get mass murdered without `` cheapening the holocaust '' . 
  [ i will never stop linking this to excuse-making brits ] ( http://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fjgyv/with_headquarters_in_poland_the_united_kingdom/cka0p6t ), 
  the fact that the game does n't really have a campaign mode turned me off , i though it feels too rtsy to play self-generated galaxies like in galciv or other turn based 4x . 
  is it really that good ? 
  now that 's a first world problem, 
  this is such an one sided interpretation of the events , it 's not even funny . 
  refer to [ this post . 
  ] ( http://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zf9l0/100_czech_intellectuals_including_fifteen_charta/cpimrhm )  czech envoy edvard bene\u0161 proposed a plebiscite . 
  the allies were shocked , arguing that the czechs were bound to lose it . 
  however , bene\u0161 was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in september 1919 . muh plebiscite, 
  and that would not be a bad thing . 
  you are aware how czechoslovakia backstabbed poland to annex the place in 1920 , right ? 
  am i completely missing the point of your post , or are you comparing russia to a `` force of nature '' ? 
  france not surviving more than a day or two against russia ? 
  i 'll give you the benefit of doubt and assume you got really high and someone convinced you russia has death ray robots and billion superhuman clone troopers , because i ca n't imagine a sane person looking at the outdated russian military filled with ak-74 armed conscripts and reaching those conclusions . 
  this is some `` dihydrogen monoxide inhalation kills thousands each year , ban now '' shit, 
   what culture does the mighty ukraine have lmao ? 
  switching the conversation to either ukraine or usa for no reason , the # 1 mark of russian butthurt , 
   and that it is n't important enough it sounds useful to fuel the russia stronk , great czar putin get many clay for motherland narrative that russians love , so it is a bit strange he 'd miss it . 
   the first is the belief that if the west went on the offensive at the beginning of the war , they would have been able to steam-roll through germany and nip the nazi problem in the bud . 
   the second is that , even if the former was true , the west could have known that it was the case both statements are false according to [ this lengthy post ] ( http://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fjgyv/with_headquarters_in_poland_the_united_kingdom/cka0p6t ) from a guy who seems to be extremely knowledgeable about the topic . 
  paging / u/jaquestrap for a source on '' [ french and british ] generals had actively called for invasion of germany in 1939 , an invasion they were prepared for and knew they could win . '', 
  his anecdote is the crediblest source of them all !, 
  i shave - a friend told me shaved pits and other places are a plus in her group of friends and that was relevant to my interests at the time , and now i just like how it looks . 
  might be in a tiny minority though , and i 'm already mostly hairless ^ ^ ^ ^ master ^ ^ ^ ^ race anyway so it was n't a very big step to make, 
   snuffing water in the nose does n't that really suck ? 
   christianity 1000 years ago was way more fucked up than islam at the time , whether you like it or not . 
  wow , after all those posts , you continue to completely miss the point . 
  even worse , from this edit it seems you 're futher away from it than before . 
  i 'm sorry we euros ca n't appreciate glorious al-andalus ~ ~ invaders ~ ~ cultural enrichers : <, 
   are you implying that everyone could play that game of invading everybody else excepte the muslims even though they did it quite `` peacefully '' given period of history we are talking about ? 
  how do you miss the point so hard ? 
  i 'm saying muslim conquests should be condemned just as other instances of military conquest should . 
  meanwhile you come here expecting people to be grateful to invaders because they were ahead at the time . 
  it 's like i 'm seeing a neonazi arguing why european colonialism was a good thing , only this one has a thing for muslims instead . 
  why ? 
  would you say the invasions were not bad then , because they were `` bringing civilization '' to some savages ? 
  11.03.2015 - the day white guilt ended . 
  thanks , man . 
   i 'm making it clear that the ussr was n't run by russians as a russian empire . 
  true , everyone still remembers the horrible process of [ `` georgization '' , right ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification#under_the_soviet_union ), 
  i 'm going on erasmus next winter , prepare your gene pools, 
  oh man , wilno shitstorm in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... * 6 hours later : called it *, 
   actually we just sort of teamed up with tee nazi 's ca n't blame anyone for doing that when faced with soviet invasion , especially considering stuff like [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/museums/10682975/the-jews-who-fought-for-hitler-we-did-not-help-the-germans.-we-had-a-common-enemy.html ) finland is the moral winner of ww2 in my eyes , gets invaded , kicks commie ass , maintains independence, 
   the czech republic has owed some territory to poland since the 1950s . 
  at the time , the border line was straightened to improve surveillance , mfd writes . 
  and here i thought we 'll get bak the rightful zaolzie clay , meh, 
   does n't precisely make me a historian yeah , i 'm starting to see that , since we 're 3 posts deep now and you still wo n't acknowledge that `` most of the land seized was n't polish anyway '' from your post up there is objectively a ** false statement ** . 
  ca n't wait for the 4th short essay length post that ignores that again . 
   especially after wwii as well , germans who have been living in poland for centuries or many decades . 
  yes , by the ... soviet installed puppet government ? 
  that does n't make a very good case to blame poland and absolve the soviet union . 
   i deride poles for a victimhood complex when they ignore all the wrongs they committed but then play victim when it comes to their wrongs .
