  it 's the / u/zyllber way . 
  misrepresent some numbers and statistics and you too can produce some fake outrage !, 
  did you know 5 trillion hungarians migrated to austria in 1956 and now today when the situation is ** totally exactly the same ** they do n't want their portion of muslims ? 
   one of the main sources of war  not every violent action taken are you sure you replied to the right post ? 
  either way , islam was made up by a violent warlord to motivate people to participate in conquests and provide him with sex slaves and conbuines , and therefore , like it or not , for the majority of its existence the `` islamic world '' was at the attacking side in wars with * infidels * . 
  the fact that the `` islamic world '' was n't at war with us for a while literally only results from the fall of ottoman empire and lack of any islamic power that could wish to threaten europe . 
  he 's not completely correct . 
  islam has been one of the main sources of war since the 7th century . 
  a turk should know ... 
  you 're obviously right in that russia feels threatened by nato . 
  that 's because nato is very negative to certain russian interests , such as exercising as much control over the former eastern bloc as possible . 
  russia feeling threatened by nato is just the inevitable result of our independence , and at this point i do n't understand why you would be concerned about that . 
  russia would not stop being threatened by nato until they have belarus or pre-maidan ukraine levels of control over entire eastern europe , and then they would find some other reason to be threatened . 
  it looks like you think this can be changed by playing nice with them , but i disagree , that was tried and it does n't work . 
  it 's your right but you 're wrong . 
  like it or not , there was massive improvement in relations with russia before they decided it would be nice to be an empire again . 
   we need to find a balance in order to keep eastern europe safe but also to entice russia out of its shell and to show them they can trust us russians have no right whatsoever to decide anything at all about nations they used to occupy , period . 
  if they want to pretend they have such rights , we absolutely need to be militarising . 
  we do n't need to pretend russia is some autistic child in his `` shell '' that wants some toys or spheres of influence and then everything will be alright . 
   already missing the cold war ? 
  `` already missing what happened to your country as a direct result of the horrible war we started ? '', 
  that 's a pretty evil sounding sentence and it 's from a morally superior german ? 
  any chance to still put up a fence ? 
  lmao western media and politicians are going to start blasting austria 24/7 now , right ? 
  resident r/europe turboleftists will soon explain why it was a mistake to let those backwards austrians join eu in 95 ? 
  why is germany [ persecuting poor scientologists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientology_in_germany ) over reasons that could easily be applied to islam or any other religion if you get creative ? 
  freedom of religion is a fundamental human right . 
  i ca n't wait for the day the opressive german scum is kicked out of the eu . 
   your country is just soaking out money of our systems get back on earth kraut , you benefit from our open markets and our brain drain more than we benefit from your pennies . 
  you thought germany + friends sent funds to ee because of their good hears ? 
  no , last time i checked eastern europeans were white and therefore unworthy of your altruism . 
  not that you giving us money for nothing would be a bad thing , i recall your kind started a certain big war some years ago and never paid us a cent of reparations for it . 
  funny that you 're able to pretend you 're morally better than us , with this debt that you will never repay and after all those crimes against humanity . 
   poland does n't fit into the eu . 
  this can be seen on the opinion of same sex marria , the refugee crisis or the far right government . 
  germany does n't fit into the eu . 
  this can be seen in [ their opinion of same sex marriage . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/27/angela-merkel-marriage-equality_n_7454090.html ) you will be leaving soon , i hope ? 
   spun by ultranationalist fascists on their side ( dip a toe in / r/russia sometime for proof positive ) as an excuse for whatever human right was stripped or bent by the kremlin . 
  the bear analogies , man . 
  the damn bear analogies . 
  it seems you spend your time shitposting here and on / r/france , so the value of your time obviously seems to be about ... 0 ? 
  statistical data about the claims from your post , please ? 
  oh no , a glorious german overlord decided we 're not good enough for his reich , what now ?!, 
  you are so dedicated to bring in people who do n't conform to any of your `` values '' at all into your country that you 're willing to cut ties with a nation because it does n't conform to a single one of your values and does n't support that need of yours to be some sort of shining moral example . 
  i would say you are insane , but that would not be nice or fair . 
  you 're just misguided . 
   but that is surely too much for you . 
  when responding to you in particular , yes , unless you compensate me for time previously wasted . 
  paypal works for you ? 
   what enthusiasm and which people ? 
  oh , playing dumb again , [ this guy was spot on ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3q7nwh/swedish_and_german_subscribers_is_dissent/cwdbz01 ) . 
  so extremely typical . 
  i am not going to waste my time listing people who enthusiastically support mass immigration , not to you . 
   i replied your post for all it was worth . 
  you see , i also value my own time and that of other readers . 
  cool , i 'm gon na assume you had no except for `` omg ur a nazi '' and that obviously would n't look good in that particular context . 
  it 's ok , do n't worry . 
  that 's it for wasting my time , i hope ? 
  no , pointing out that the entusiasm some people show towards mass immigration into their countries can not be a product of sane minds is not as bad as being compared to one of the worst groups in the history of humanity . 
  do i really have to tell you this ? 
   also , what do you know about the values of hundreds of thousands of refugees ? 
  i know enough , and so do you , since you apparently browse this sub enough to know how horribly xenophobic it is . 
  if you 're looking for a discussion about the immigrants and their attachment to a certain backwards religion , that 's not going to happen since you 've previously [ replied to my long posts with single sentences ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3q7nwh/swedish_and_german_subscribers_is_dissent/cwdbeqc?context=13 ) and i value my time somewhat, 
  clearly my taste differs from yours , so i 'm satisfied :\\ ^ )  edit : i also find your dismissive use of the word `` leftist '' very amusing , and i 'm not even one . 
  i generally am one though and i have no problems admitting that most people who went insane about tolerance of our uninvited guests and their 1400 years old values do so because they are leftists . 
  we clearly have very different experiences then ? 
   get dissenting opinions below the -5 threshold of doom ... you actually care if you get downvoted below the visibility level ? 
  some mental fortitude ... 
  i actually like to scroll to the very bottom right away to see the funniest leftist comments of any given thread , so that kind of sorting works for me, 
  that would be the vast majority of the userbase of this website . 
  if your opinion of it is that low , should n't you be on srs or some other site ? 
  well anyway i do regret writing a long post now . 
  i think it 's time for you to call me a nazi and depart , no ? 
  that 's what up and downvotes are used for in practice . 
   but it does n't suppress a single thing . 
  you can pretend that a constant stream of baseless insults flowing from the media and leftists should have no * supressing * effect but you will just be pretending . 
  shit arguments do amount to something in significant enough numbers . 
   europeans complaining that their views on immigration are `` suppressed '' are the same kind of people that in america would complain about the `` war on christmas '' , or the `` suppression '' of their `` southern heritage '' . 
   you have all the mental fortitude of a suckling baby we do n't really have to look far , do we ? 
  this thread is full of examples , your post included . 
  the top post all bring actual examples of supression , but you do n't choose to reply and debate any of them , you choose to write a separate comment where you straight away baselessly compare anyone who dares to disagree with you to american rednecks ( probably the least `` positive '' group you could think of in this context , eh ? ) . 
  then you reply and what a big surprise , it 's personal insults again . 
  truth is , if your kind throws around enough shit at the first sight of disagreement , some of it will stick . 
  only question is if you 're doing it consciously or not . 
   not that `` ur a nazi xenophobe , fuck u '' is the sort of argument that actually annoys the `` fortress europe '' brigade anyway . 
  what else , then ? 
  this is pretty much the only arguments to be seen here . 
  i ca n't recall the last time immigration discussion here did n't end in the leftist side going `` oh my god you 're all such xenophobes this subreddit is literally full of nazis what am i doing here '' and abandoning the thread , really . 
  there are people who never wrote a single functional pro-immigration argument , but write poetry on how this sub is a `` violent and toxic cesspool of bigotry and hatred , in which circlejerk statements and reactionary ignorance are awarded and most forms of civil discussion have become prohibited '' ( actual quote ) . 
  try not to get annoyed by that , day after day . 
  i 'll downvote you because you seem to think rejecting `` ur a nazi xenophobe , fuck u '' * arguments * is the wrong thing to do, 
  you did not even understand the definition i provided . 
  i 'm quite sure it was n't `` behaving in a way that suggests one has higher standards or more noble beliefs than poland '' . 
  it 's ok , you should be learning arabic instead of english anyway . 
   are you sure you know what the word `` hypocrite '' means ? 
  `` behaving in a way that suggests one has higher standards or more noble beliefs than is the case . '', 
  i ca n't imagine a more fitting word for germany in regards to the immigrant crisis . 
  if germans think it will not be pointed out to them that they are hypocrites who greatly overstate the importance of their precious condescending opinions , they will be very disappointed as well . 
  i thought his post referred to the fact that everything is expensive as fuck in the uk from the position of an usual international student , not that there are some special money milking practices in place to rob international students .
