  now i 'm not sure, 
  i also like to speak in this modern internet language, 
  i get your point but i disagree - the current immigrant wave is so different from the situation in 1956 that i do n't think hungarians have any obligation , moral or any other obligation whatsoever , to `` return the favor '' . 
  well , that and the fact that this is a purely theoretical discussion because none of the immigrants want to be refugees in hungary . 
   they were seen just as foreign as muslims are now . 
  i do n't know if that 's true for the netherlands or not , but how the dutch perceived them is irrelevant . 
  in reality hungarians in 1956 were not nearly as different from western europeans as the muslims were or are , and unless you have factual sources for this as well as your two other extreme statements * `` do n't be under the assumption that eastern europe was anything like western europe back then . 
  '' * and * `` back then the cultural differences between your average christian and average muslim were less than the cultural difference between a western european and an eastern european . 
  '' * those will remain your unfounded personal opinion . 
  i 'm particulary interested in the last one . 
   they were the same country , not the same nation . 
  what do you think the ausgleich was about ? 
  i believe you 're being schooled about this by an actual hungarian [ here ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pwsk0/on_this_day_in_1956_hungary_stood_up_against/cwagpc0 ) right now and he definitely knows more about this than me . 
  anyway , you seem to be under impression that under austria and austria-hungary , the hungarians must have lived in tribal communities in separated portions of the country . 
  in reality the former european empires left influences on their subject nations to the point where [ the political division of my country aligns almost perfectly with borders of former empires ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/poland_2007_election_results.jpg/350px-poland_2007_election_results.jpg ) and that 's in present times , and we had a far worse relationship with prussia than hungarians had with austria . 
  but you 're still free to pretend hungarians were actually from another planet , if that helps you . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ was n't ^ ^ ^ ^ serious ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ all, 
  my point is that outcomes of failed middlea eastern immigrant integration are right there , and you really do n't have to force some comparison with hungarians . 
  i do n't see many hungarian ghettos after that 1956 migration , but you tell me that was the same thing ? 
  any hungarian communities around you that are significantly overrepresented in crime ? 
   back then the cultural differences between your average christian and average muslim were less than the cultural difference between a western european and an eastern european . 
   do n't be under the assumption that eastern europe was anything like western europe back then . 
  let me see your sources for this load of shit ? 
  do you literally just make stuff up as you go to support your views ? 
  it 1956 , hungary and other ee countries relevant in this discussion were under communist puppet regimes for more or less 10 years . 
  are you suggesting those extreme differences materialized in a decade ? 
  most hungarians in 1956 went to austria . 
  they were the same nation up until 1914 . 
  so different !, 
   really hope you have some space left . 
  there is no limit so no worries !, 
  i am honored, 
  look , my point is that you are trying to equalize two situations that are only similar if you maybe try very hard to describe them in the same way , only because the final outcome of situation 1 . is what you hope will be the final outcome of situation 2 . 
  and i guess you really really want to make a certain point . 
  no real conclusions about the current crisis can be drawn from 1956 . 
  if you want some , i suggest you look at the wonderfully successful integration of middle easterners in west europe so far . 
  how far from the nearest muslim ghetto do you live ? 
  what about hungarian ghettos :\\ ^ ) ? 
  separating garbage and following a violent religion grounded in unchangeable 1400 years old laws and values written down by a brutal warlord and pedophile are pretty much the same thing , got it . 
   insidious lies i feel like you can do much better than that with your expressions of outrage . 
  i want another dramatic masterpiece on the level of `` violent and toxic cesspool of bigotry and hatred , in which circlejerk statements and reactionary ignorance are awarded and most forms of civil discussion have become prohibited '' . 
  western europe managed to integrate 200000 hungarians , with their backwards religion , backwards culture and their endless thirst for welfare ? 
  thank you for this piece of information about those ( totally equivalent to the current crisis ) events !, 
  deffinitely missing `` xenophobe '' among few others, 
   if poles find that keeping refugees is draining on their economy they should ask their politicians why that is so . 
  do i really need andrzej duda to tell me why providing for people costs money ? 
  so , as punishment for talking mean things about your country you actually want to take away the biggest pull factor of the entire mass migration , the dream of german welfare ? 
  jesus fucking christ a german actually has a right idea about the immigration crisis for once . 
  and were mostly elected when immigration policy was no concern for anybody, 
  \\  poor countries with no means and will to host immigrants repeatedly state they do n't want and ca n't host immigrants \\  germany forces them to do so anyway \\  obviously immigrants are not housed in proper living conditions because those conditions do n't exist \\  poor countries are punished for the obvious outcome of german insanity nothing wrong with that :\\ ^ ), 
   no benefits irrelevant as it 's more profitable for them to be illegal in germany than to get welfare in postcommunist countries  deport them back if they come that 's the endgame , your final plan ? 
  a situation where thousands of people regularly try to sneak into your country ? 
  the 1 % does n't want to be part of argentina either , they wanted to be fully independent, 
  too late , the general secretary of the central committee of the communist party of / r/europe , / u/zyllber already decided you are yet another neonazi in this * violent and toxic cesspool of bigotry and hatred , in which circlejerk statements and reactionary ignorance are awarded and most forms of civil discussion have become prohibited * ( his actual quote , i shit you not ) . 
  proceed to the nearest gulag , wrongthinker . 
  is there some method or reason for the seemingly random capitalization in your post or do you just enjoy giving people cancer ? 
  it definitely will if they can can prove someone guilty of this i 'm not saying what happened is right but you have to admit it 's an extremely good way of making sure there are no immigrants where you live . 
  the arsonists achieved their goal - no matter how angry the state gets , there will be no immigrants in the area unless the state can build a new asylum home in an unrealistically short period of time . 
  anyone who wishes to adopt islam as their pet cause could take a nice trip to / r/islam and find out what you just wrote from the * moderate muslims * that reside there . 
  death for apostasy , unchangeable religious law that 's absolutely perfect in any way , it 's all favored by those * moderates * . 
  lol nice one, 
  hey guys dae cosinder all people who are not far left open border fanatics to be far right nationalists :d :d :d ????? 
  the majority of threads posted in / r/europe in the past few months are legitimate reports about the developing crisis . 
  if the behavior of immigrants is such that you think factual news about them must be created by right wing nationalists with an agenda , then that speaks more about the immigrants than anything else . 
  you are completely wrong and your `` proof '' is a single stormfront post from over a year ago . 
  the `` normal users which did n't come here with the sole purpose of brigading to push their extreme right agenda 's . '', 
  did n't go anywhere and did n't get replaced by stormfront shills , or whatever other paranoia you might have . 
  the response of the left wing towards the immigrant crisis ranges from complete disconnect from reality ( no borders let them all in ) to a total lack of any idea what to do without being `` racist '' , and so people shift their views on the matter to the right because they want the crisis solved . 
  you do n't need stormfront psyops for that to happen . 
  i post heavily against mass immigration to the point where you would probably think i must be a stormfront shill if you went through my posts , yet last time i checked i 'm still hapilly center left on most social issues and that 's also one reason why i do n't want large numbers of muslims in europe . 
  edit : boo-hoo , i see you 're not used to people disagreeing with you . 
  deal with it . 
   croatia is trying to do its best with helping migrants riiiight , with your horrible uneatable macaroni . 
  monsters . 
   which is a full 180 degrees from where it was 3 years ago . 
  plebeian leftist circlejerk ? 
   most / r/europe users are right wing nationalist citation needed, 
  there 's enough of them to change europe to the point where it 's no longer an attractive place for more immigrants . 
  it has the power to force migrant quotas on nations that do n't want migrants , apparently , so stop bitching, 
  yes , on a goat . 
  orb\u00e1n 's [ neonazi mindcontrol ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/cnc/images/3/34/yuri_with_psychic_beacon_model.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140202085048 ) forces innocent germans to strip immigrants of their most basic human rights !, 
  or to sweden :(, 
  maybe i should 've added that besides not working for us , the laws are very clearly not working for the immigrants as well . 
  by humanity , you mean the laws that motivate the entire crisis and lead to all the death and suffering by telling the migrants they can come and live great lives here if they just manage to find a smuggler who will take them to greece on a shitty boat or who will stuff 71 of them in a meat truck headed for germany ? 
  remember [ this one ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03420/austria_migrants_t_3420871b.jpg ) ? 
  that was your moral laws . 
  this [ poor guy ] ( http://images.christianpost.com/full/86770/three-year-old-drowned-syrian-boy.jpg ) ? 
  those humane laws of yours as well . 
  you clearly made your decision and convinced yourself it 's the right one , but at least drop the sense of moral superiority , murderer . 
   moral superpower even more useless than aquaman 's !, 
  if this is a law that we wrote and only we care about and it 's very clearly not working well for us , maybe it 's time to rewrite it ? 
  it will be totally different from the xenophobic racist hungarian nazifence , no worries !, 
  smashing, 
  those insults get more funny everyday . 
   with the conclusion of the danish reformation in 1536 , jews along with catholics , were prohibited entry into denmark  under boles\u0142aw iii ( 1102 -- 1139 ) , the jews , encouraged by the tolerant regime of this ruler , settled throughout poland damn i wish we could 've been as nice to them as denmark :(, 
  trigger warnings come at the beginning of your post , opressor !, 
  you triggered me !, 
  my pale skin is usually enough :\\ ^ ), 
   when you run out of arguments . 
  `` mutti merkel is the final authority on eu standards of behavior because i said so , now do what she says or fuck off '' is not something that deserves argumentation , no .
