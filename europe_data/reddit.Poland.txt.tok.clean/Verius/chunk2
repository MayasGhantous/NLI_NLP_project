  then why should we bother ourselves with this disgusting display of evil western influence ? 
  at least we can still look back to the russian empire , the proud slavic nation that was never cruel and dictatorial to anynone !, 
  oh , you 're this guy . 
  now tell us how horrible the eu is and how poland should align itself with russia , the proud slavic nation that was never cruel and dictatorial to anyone . 
  ussr is russia if we 're talking about beating hitler . 
  ussr also immediately becomes definitelynotrussia if you try talking about gulags or other soviet `` achievements '' . 
  well , i 'm pretty sure hitler is not [ the third most popular german ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/12/28/us-russia-stalin-idustre4br17620081228 ) by now . 
  dzie\u0144 dobry , it 's commonwealth time, 
  actually it 's indonesiasphere , do n't listen to the guy, 
  thank you uncle stalin for your preference of living slaves instead of lebensraum, 
   drove home the victory funny way to say `` raped everything with a vagina in every country they passed through '', 
  and jamaica , or so i heard, 
  i 'm strapping on my hussar wings as we speak, 
  say what , skurwielu, 
  why is that , friend ? 
  no , appeasing imperialistic warmongers can turn out bad for europe, 
  i like how after 6 hours , we have yet to see a german response . 
  germany can not into romance . 
   it is know ( sic ) that either `` you 're with them or with us '' it is know . 
  not dependent on russian energy . 
   i never made an argument teor basically floats between hyperboles , personal attacks , memes and calling out things he perceives as logical fallacies . 
  one of my favorite russian specimens . 
  oh , and who would you see as our version of lukashenko after we devolve into 2nd belarus ? 
  are you the guy who said poland should acquire nukes and essentially become a local north korea , or was it some other moron from r/europe ? 
  * nice . 
  u wot m8, 
  [ it 's , kurwa , happening ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcy68cwdkve ), 
  i thought we were friends , romania-senpai, 
  the context is whataboutism, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes educate yourself , ~ ~ kacap ~ ~ dirty kacap, 
  uh , guys ... what about some commonwealth ? 
   typical sanctimonious ` murican post typical pointless ruskie whataboutism . 
  shh , go to sleep, 
  u wot m8, 
   same goes for hitler and most rulers in human history . 
  we 're at `` hitler did nothing wrong '' already ? 
  that 's something you should probably not say when antifa is around by the way . 
   im trying to have a discussion here . 
  i 'm not , as i 'm stating for the 3rd or 4th time now . 
  you 're free to stop replying , or you can continue to entertain me . 
  we were at most discussing lenin , except it was n't much of a discussion at all because you made a bold , idiotic claim despite having no knowledge about history . 
   m not even an activist but even if i was how in the would that be releva because i 'm not debating you , i 'm just laughing at you , comrade , 
  i guess it makes sense they do n't teach you about the polish-soviet war in russia , considering how badly the glorious revolutionary army lost at warsaw , 
   i dont care who is on the other side when discussing poltical philosophy me neither , but we 're not discussing political philosophy . 
  i know all i wanted to know and it makes sense , german antifa thugs really enjoy spray-painting their hammers and sickles . 
  good luck building communism kumpel !, 
  east germany ? 
  dumbest shit i read in a while ( people were shoved the idea of communism down their throats and most of them were happy for a couple of years , lol ) , but note how i do n't care about your commie rants . 
  i 'm now characterizing your to put you in my little biology book , answer my previous question :  out of curiosity , where are you from , russia ? 
  perhaps western , but a rebellious teenager ? 
  you have some , umm , strong opinions for someone who really has no idea about the topic . 
  i do n't care for your commie rants , translate this to english , sounds funny :  three ( 3 ) separate instances poleings have build deathcamps, 
   thats not because communism is evil oh , okay . 
  is it evil because it 's a failed system that , at best , creates a totalitarian , poor shithole and at worst you get commie cambodia ? 
  out of curiosity , where are you from , russia ? 
  perhaps western , but a rebellious teenager ? 
  you have some , umm , strong opinions for someone who really has no idea about the topic . 
   three ( 3 ) separate instances poleings have build deathcamps u wot m8 oh , you 're this guy , i remember reading your trash before . 
  english was better back then though . 
  that makes you a very evil/misguided person , but that 's not the point . 
  you claimed that lenin `` almost made the utopian communism a thing '' , apparently according to your history books . 
  when and where , exactly ? 
  what was the high point of lenin 's commie paradise ? 
  the introduction of delicious [ human flesh to many russians ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=cannibalism+russian+famine&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=qittu9cwfuew7aboyyc4ag&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=653#q=cannibalism+russian+famine+1921&amp;tbm=isch ), 
   ok i admit it i honestly dont have any actual idea about the rulers of the soviet union . 
  that is very apparent , you may want to refrain from making such bold statements as '' lenin was one of the most genius man who almost made the utopian communism a thing '' in the future on topics you have no idea about . 
   lenin and trotski were true pushers of the original idea of communism which isnt bad per se .

  downplaying america 's role in ww2 does n't ? 
  the guy above straight up ignored japan 's participation in ww2 ( but of course , the great patriotic war was ussr vs. nazis , no space for anyone one else ) , lend-lease and reality , but you are n't calling him out . 
   who said russia was the greatest winner ? 
  russians , since they rebranded ww2 into the [ `` great patriotic war '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_patriotic_war_ ( term ) where they fight alone . 
  i guess it is a smart move considering the real ww2 starts with the soviet union invading poland together with their ally nazi germany , right ? 
   it really makes you wonder who won in the long term those who avoided communism won , those who did n't lost . 
  fair world . 
  `` allied '', 
  lol , the comments on this thing, 
  oh please , any russian will tell you that stalin is absolutely innocent and holodomor was a sad accident . 
  it 's okay if millions starve because of your failed , forcefully imposed system as long as it is n't intentional genocide , duh !, 
  u wot m8, 
  come to think of it , i absolutely did n't . 
  sure , what about you , moskal ? 
  can you ? 
  is 1612 the only slightly relevant date you know ? 
  there 's like a 100 dates we would never forget that are more important than the failed conquest of our backwards eastern neighbors , 
  tell me more about the russian null systems , are they a few orders of magnitude more lawless than other null systems ? 
  oh well , my bad . 
  he did express himself in a way i would expect an american shitposter to write - disregard facts , call someone a surrender monkey for good measure, 
   zealous free market fundamentalist like you and i eat proletariyat children for breakfast while stroking myself with the invisible hand of the market and praying to satan , correct  you can point to what the lithuanian government claims all day , thats not providing any proof . 
  well , if you do n't consider statements made by the government of lithuania about lithuania good enough , you may not find any satisfaction . 
   problems of the modern free market economies in eastern europe . 
  and these problems , as i said before , exist because eastern europe was forced into communism and has still to transition into a functional economy , because it was denied development for decades . 
   not problems of the past communist regimes . 
  you seem to think that the soviets are blameless because the problems emerged after the ussr fell apart . 
  you do realize that transition from communism to a free market economy is the only option these nations had , as the ussr literally does n't exist anymore and ca n't provide them with subsidies to keep things going , right ? 
  even if they wanted ( lol ) they ca n't magically keep living in the soviet utopia , because it does n't exist . 
  communists put them in this situation and and communism is to blame for problems that arise during the period where they are fixing the post-communist mess . 
  they were given no other option . 
  i seriously have no idea why you insist on thinking that communist responsibility ends where the ussr ends .
