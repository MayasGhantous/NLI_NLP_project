  nothing to say about the actual topic of suicides in lithuania/the eastern bloc , better complain about a single phrase you did n't like . 
   do you realise how indoctrinated you sound ? 
  yup , i 'm the one who sounds indoctrinated here , not the guy hopelessly trying to defend one of the most criminal and dysfunctional systems in history . 
  anyway , i will now rephrase my previous post slightly and send it to you again , so we can get back to the discussion without you getting angry at capitalism , comrade : well , according to lithuanian government itself `` a main reason behind the dramatic rise in suicides over the last decade is the economic and social transition . '', 
  this economic and social transition is only required because the country spent decades in a forcefully imposed , disfunctional system - if the country was given the chance to develop ~ ~ naturally ~ ~ successfully , these problems would not exist . 
  communism is ** directly ** responsible for these problems . 
  i like it because , if it 's really worded like / u/callumgg said , it 's pretty neutral - it could technically appeal to progressive people too . 
  it 's better than `` eu gay nazi zionist transsexuals will turn your sons gay then fuck them '' and well , it 's really no different from [ this one ] ( http://www.ontopmag.com/images/articleimages/obama_gay_marriage_abortion_billboard.jpg ), 
   relationship between suicide and past central planning ? 
  well , according to lithuanian government itself `` a main reason behind the dramatic rise in suicides over the last decade is the economic and social transition . '', 
  this economic and social transition is only required because the country spent decades in a forcefully imposed , disfunctional system - if the country was given the chance to develop naturally , these problems would not exist . 
  communism is ** directly ** responsible for these problems . 
   on another note , there is nothing particularly functional about the modern market economies of eastern europe . 
  yes . 
  because they still have to recover from communism . 
  that 's what i said . 
   last time i checked eastern european countries have market economies . 
  transition from a centrally planned communist shitter to a ** functional ** market economy takes time . 
  look at east germany - it is relatively small , gets gigantic subsidies from the west ever since reunification and is still miles behind in , well , almost everything . 
  do you seriously think the problems created by 45 years of communist rule can be fixed that quickly ? 
  is the fact that the iron curtain draws a [ clear line between europe and europoor ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/images/content/europe-gdp-per-capita-ppp.jpg ) a coincidence ? 
  i like how it 's just a simple statement and not at all negative if you 're not into persecuting homosexuals, 
   what are the chances that he gets re-elected at the end of his 3rd term ? 
  u wot m8, 
   almost everything i post is critical of american propaganda . 
  there 's a difference , * kid * ? 
   too bad that you do n't have any actual authority to enforce this . 
  oh shit , you sure showed me with your freedom of speech , * boy * . 
  i tip my fedora at you . 
  and the authority is right there , your post is safely hidden at the bottom with -13 important internet points, 
  mostly everything you post here is pro-russian drivel , i 'm just trying to direct you to a place where calling americans warmongers/provocators and excusing everything russia does will get you some approval , * buddy . 
  * you also write like someone who owns at least one fedora . 
  i presume i 'm instructing you to leave now , * mate . 
  / r/russia is that way, 
   attitude of the russian people who showed remarkable resilience after suffering so much humiliation a couple of decades ago when they could n't keep their empire anymore ? 
  oh , must 've been terrible you hear that , eastern bloc ? 
  by breaking free of ussr tyranny , we might have * hurt some russian feelings . 
  * we should apologize !, 
  i bet he would love to . 
  rekt, 
   thing is , if you state something , burden of proof is on you .

  [ the prayer-magnifying relay network is fully operational !, 
  everyone in poland prayed to jan pawe\u0142 ii at the same time and changed the flight , starting a chain of events not even the grand white wizard putin can stop . 
  we are truly the worst . 
   first you go beat up  then you beat up that sounds like a very russian way to deal with things, 
   if i were the russian president then trust me if you were the russian president , the country would not exist for a while now . 
  sadly that wo n't happen because i do n't think you 're qualified . 
  putin is evil , but he 's also smart and powerful - everything you write indicates you 're just evil and stupid . 
  good luck in next russian `` elections '' i guess . 
  ... keep going, 
  it 's 2014, 
  america-senpai noticed us , uguu, 
  give bak rightful clay !!, 
  yes , please stay the fuck away, 
  it means `` ass '' in german and sounds bad . 
  `` poland '' comes from `` pole '' which means an open field because we always had lots of plains , i 'm sure you could include that in your epic tale instead . 
   people of po you can do better than , cmon, 
  collected from 3 posts :  get the fuck out of my face  mentally retarded people like you  are you truly all stupid enough  enjoy your police state . 
   `` free speech '' my arse . 
   only thing even more brainwashed than the average russian is the average us citizen . 
  i suppose vladimir pays extra for posts where you insult someone and randomly write something mean about usa  ? 
   defend horrendous post 09/11 war crimes i 'm not defending a single thing . 
  this is a thread about stalinism , and post 9/11 american crimes have 0 relevance to it . 
  you could literally post undeniable proof that george bush is a psychic vampire from mars trying to destroy earth and it still means nothing to our topic of stalingrad here . 
  i know / u/tittybangbang123 started this , but you 're only making this worse through participation . 
   you have to be russian not to abide with your us allies no , but you 're debating guantanamo in a post about soviet crimes , and whataboutism of that magnitude is a pretty clear indicator . 
  how does one get recruited to putin 's internet army ? 
  i could use some extra cash and sometimes i already shitposted as a russian when drunk . 
  please lead me to your boss , m8 , 
  nothing like a little civilian massacre to brighten your day, 
   italy in the world wars lol, 
  once again , you seem to blame the polish for a mass deportation carried out by the soviets - they did not deport the germans , the soviets did . 
  deported poles could sit down on the ground as they left their luxury cattle trains and refuse to move , and the germans would still get kicked out . 
  now , this is a part where you might disagree , but i think they would be justified in taking german homes and property anyway - when you 're forced to be a part of a massive and brutal population movement , you do what you have to . 
  you wo n't live homeless and starve because someone theoretically refused to move away when they were supposed to . 
   20 % of the 11m people being `` evicted '' have died in the process and that 's a sad trademark of soviet deportations . 
  only reason why russians can claim crimea , too . 
  oh man , the sudden surge of those posts about soviet ww2 contribution is so interesting . 
  i 'm sure it has no relation to the ukrainian crisis whatsoever !, 
  and all the posters get so offended when you mention other soviet [ `` contributions '' . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_crimes ), 
   courtesy of su and poland . 
  i do n't like your tone - you do realize the poles you 're talking about ended up in those areas because of forced deportations with a huge death toll , right ? 
  so the answer to my question is that you 're a psycho and russians are bloodthirsty murderers focused on wiping entire nations out . 
  got it . 
  i 'll hit you up when i come up with more questions i 'd like to ask to a russian apologist with a very funny approach to history !, 
  and to prove that you link to a wikipedia article that states repeatedly how the `` elections '' were a fraudulent joke . 
  cool . 
  seriously , i saw many commie apologists on the internet before , but they did n't even try to pretend post ww2 poland was n't a puppet state . 
  you are something else , wow . 
  ok , you could be a long term source of fun though . 
  pure russian propaganda personified . 
  next question . 
   katyn ( allegedly ) explain the `` allegedly '' part in katy\u0144 please, 
  still waiting for you to explain how [ polish people voted for communism , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2547ch/soviets_saved_europe_from_fascism_says_vladimir/chegh72?context=3 ) buddy . 
  and i 'm not going to forget that until you provide me with citations about the `` vote '' . 
   it 's not our fault you got taken over by the ussr . 
  yeah , you only betrayed our alliance and failed to do what was promised when germany and ** ussr ** invaded in 1939 , back when you and the frenchies still had massive superiority over both [ ( citation ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fjgyv/with_headquarters_in_poland_the_united_kingdom/cka0p6t?context=3 ) . 
  not your fault , bitch ?
