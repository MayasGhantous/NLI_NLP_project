  what did i just read ? 
  my 13 years old sister writes in much better english , so i 'll give you one chance to read my post again - i 'm not calling you an idiot because you are a leftist or in favor of uncontrolled immigration of the entire continent of africa to europe . 
  that would make you very confused , but i 'm calling you an idiot for your typical leftist response where anyone presenting an opinion to the right of yours must be an idiot . 
  in fact , i 'm calling you an idiot for exactly what you 're trying to accuse me of here . 
   at least in my eyes for such a comment . 
  that 's okay , you are an idiot in my eyes for immediately dismissing someone because he does n't meet your political correctness quotas . 
  what ? 
  i believe you were provided with a link describing a soviet version of systematic extermination , making them equal to the nazis . 
  what is it that you 're trying to say here, 
  yes , and your original post was completely useless because `` it 's up to them to decide '' applies to polish people from both sides . 
  what was [ it ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i40yi/23_august_european_day_of_remembrance_for_victims/cuds06n ) about ? 
  what ? 
  what was [ this post ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i40yi/23_august_european_day_of_remembrance_for_victims/cuds06n ) about then ? 
  you seem very confused . 
   all i am trying to communicate to you that if you claim stalin victims/their descendants can only themselves interpret their fate , that applies to the victims of the auschwitz gas chambers as well . 
  and that 's exactly what 's happening here , since poles suffered both under the nazis and soviets . 
  2 million ethnic poles were killed by the nazis too , many in gas chambers . 
  we get to decide , not some greek leftist , which is what happened in the original post up there . 
  of course the same logic does n't apply . 
  what i 'm saying is based on historical facts . 
  there are archived signed orders commanding extermination of all polish people on the territory of ussr , and we know how they were carried out . 
  i can tell the victims of the holocaust they suffered just as bad as the victims of communism , because they did . 
  to deny that is to deny that targeted mass murder of poles happened , which is equal to holocaust denial , good job . 
  homework for you : educate yourself about the polish operation of nkvd , then come back here and see if you 're still just as willing to defend your side , mark * left *, 
   racist propaganda if an unedited video showing how the immigrants act is `` racist propaganda '' , something might be wrong with the immigrants . 
  what, 
   force the `` nazism and communism are the same '' ideology they absolutely are . 
  both commited intentional genocide on my people ( they did , and if you disagree that 's because you do n't know history ) , what gives you the right to decide which one can i consider evil ? 
   not even only a specific group of people actually they did that too sometimes . 
  the ussr and nazi germany are completely equal from his point of view , i guess . 
  edit : link got fucked : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_ ( 1937 % e2 % 80 % 9338 ), 
   the auschwitz survivors that got liberated by the red army certainly would n't agree with you . 
  what about the hundreds of thousands of raped women :\\ ^ ) ? 
   everyone who does n't agree is a `` russian shill '' or a `` commie pinko '' and should be driven out . 
  i think you 're just a fucking idiot with a mild hardon for the far left , honestly . 
  please go on telling the victims of communism how they 're allowed to feel about their tormentors, 
  i think you would n't be supporting them if they did n't share your political affiliation , but then , i do n't really care about the opinion of someone confused enough to belong to marxist organisations . 
  what was [ this post ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i2ppb/naked_and_bloodied_corpse_of_a_female_kurdish/cucumbh ) about , though ? 
  austria is n't turkey or `` kurdistan '' either , yet you just said you have no problems demonstrating in support of the kurs . 
  europeans only get to talk about the topic when they 're * enlightened leftists * ? 
  is this your blog ? 
  pkk are still terrorists , no matter how many commie meetings you attend , and i still get to say that despite not being turkish . 
  apparently being austrian did n't stop you from sucking off pkk terrorists , right ? 
  haha , it 's you , i ca n't imagine why the leading communism fanboy of / r/europe would support a bunch of socialist terrorists . 
  but to actually answer your comment : no , it is not , which does n't stop me from forming opinions based on the information i know . 
  kinda like you seem to have your of opinions about the soviet union despite austria only ever receiving a very small share of communist terror . 
  she 's definitely `` my '' terrorist then . 
   lets start killing people because they thr\u03b5w some rocks you realize you can very easily kill someone with a rock to the head ? 
  top kek, 
  literally brain-damaged drunks, 
   russian  refined, 
   polarises society into radical political corectness and ultranationalism . 
  it 's not that i 'm gon na become an ultranationalist because of this , i 'm just gon na vote for them so they can fix the problem . 
  \\  get 376 million $ in aid and loans from us to rebuild after ww2 , almost 4 billion $ adjusted for inflation today \\  commence crying about the us on the internet i see the greek tradition of complete lack of gratitude towards people trying to save greece from the greeks is not limited to germany . 
  at least you do n't discriminate , i guess . 
  by `` shitting all over the world '' you mean `` saving my dumb greek ass from forced friendship with vladko putin '' ? 
   ( not that anyone herw talks about you outside of the internet ) what ? 
  who is `` me '' ? 
  poland ? 
  usa ? 
  you think nobody talks about usa and nato outside of the internet ? 
  have you ever read something in paper form that was n't a celebrity gossip tabloid ? 
  i would hope this event reduces the usual western european bitching about usa somewhat , but who am i kidding, 
  so now you are not trying to claim that the muslim immigrants are not better or worse anymore , but that their criminal behavior is justified by the circumstance ? 
  keep moving that goalpost , leftie . 
  i 'm actually comparing eu economic migrants to african economic ( mostly ) migrants though . 
  [ crime statistics are a racist tool of the neonazi far right !,

  yes , someone ca n't tell the concept of polish people escaping from war and occupation , working hard and integrating into their host countries apart from the concept of muslims escaping from war and going full religion of peace in their host countries . 
  glad you noticed . 
   are you making that classic / r/europe mistake of thinking i 'm an ambassador for my country or something ? 
   your country had millions of refugees  you refuse to return the favour ? 
   someone from poland saying this :\\ ^ ), 
  for someone who is politically correct enough to pretend the religion/culture of our current immigrants is not the problem , you seem to have a strange fixation on poland . 
  show me on the doll where the poles touched you . 
  but coming back to your question , it is once again either incredibly dishonest or fucking idiotic to pretend that polish conservativeness can be compared to the culture of muslim immigrants . 
  when we elect grzegorz braun ( 0.83 % votes in the last elections ) or someone just as backwards , you get to start comparing . 
  ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_r0luc5ghzjxadcinwngqbmcmclooezgs,w400.jpg ), 
  mostly moderate left , is that what you wanted to see ? 
  does n't mean i have to hapilly let in masses people who reject secularism and progress because it 's currently expected that leftists will pretend all cultures are equal . 
  lol i was about to get into a bit more detail , but honestly , if you 're trying to compare the incompatible muslim hordes with perfectly integrated polish migrants from decades ago then you 're either extremely dishonest or a fucking idiot , and in both cases not worth my time . 
  which option is it ? 
  [ is he cosplaying ?

   all czechs are hereby declared as a bunch of racists unless the only winning move is not to play and completely stop caring if the far left thinks you 're racist or not, 
   criticism of islam is ok when it is relevant . 
  i do n't think it is revevant in the topic of refugee crissis . 
  you 're extremely confused then, 
  can you actually dispute anything that is said in that post , or will you just keep repeating that it 's on / r/european , x-posted from coontown and therefore literally full hitler 1488, 
   homogenous countries are literally hitler now ? 
  finally time to put on my nazi gear and shine, 
  but in the long term support of poland is absolutely their problem , if there 's a military conflict with russia , i 'm sure germans would prefer warsaw to be the battleground over berlin . 
   germany expecting 650000 refugees this year  is tiny compared to the population xd, 
  correct , what do you not understand ? 
  it 's immigration and it 's currently happening in mass numbers, 
  i did, 
  i do n't have enough experience with tasting feet to debate this :(, 
  what the hell man , tikka masala is at least okay, 
  something like this : if u were killed tomorrow , i wouldnt go 2 ur funeral cuz id b n jail 4 killin da person that killed u !,
