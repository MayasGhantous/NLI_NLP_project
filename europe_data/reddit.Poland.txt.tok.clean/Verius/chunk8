  the megathread changed one thing for me - i now go to / r/european for news that interest me , because / r/euromigration is mostly dead , the `` megathread '' is unreadable and was n't updated in days , and i really do n't care that much how other countries call a fucking platypus . 
  the comments are mostly disgusting as they are filled with neonazis , homophobes and full blown racists who definitely do n't have any sensible ideas about dealing with immigration , but hey , got ta get the news somewhere . 
  not a big fan of censorship . 
  thanks / r/europe mods !, 
  facts are racist, 
   note that i am arguing the inconsistency of the application of the word ` genocide ' , not whether or not x or why is a genocide . 
  you repeatedly argued ( and basically continue to do so ) that ** targeted ** killing of over 100000 ethnic poles is not genocide :  i do n't see how 100,000 dead poles at the hands of stalin is genocide . 
   there is no such thing as a scholarly recognised genocide of the poles . 
  you ca n't just create a victimhood status for any sort of a mass killing , otherwise the word genocide is literally cheapened . 
   please refrain from cheapening the holocaust and other genocides by saying there was a genocide of the poles this is why you briefly changed your mind , because it was pointed out to you that the polish operation was a genocide unlike many mass killings , because it included the intent to specifically exterminate polish people . 
  as for your concerns with inconsistency , you are free to call other things that fit the definition of genocide `` genocide '' if you are so inclined , and argue with people who disagree . 
  that is irrelevant and completely disconnected with the polish operation . 
  see , this is why people dislike and downvote you . 
  you claim the polish operation was not genocide , you get showered with definitions widely accepted by official bodies that show the polish operation was a genocide , and now you 're going on in 4 long fucking paragraphs on how you were concerned with inconsistency and politicization all along . 
   you 're a nationalist pole . 
  this sub is full of them , you can hardly meet a non-nationalist pole in a history discussion , it 's like cockroaches coming out of woodwork . 
  yes , i call certain deeds of ussr by names that fit them according to valid definitions . 
  such rabid nationalism, 
   do you think that people can lie about me , twist my words and invent things where did that happen ? 
  [ here 's your post where you admit there was a genocide ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30cuip/tartu_estonia_commemorating_the_march_deportation/cpswe2x ) ( this is the last time i thought you are moderately reasonable in your defense of russia ) and [ here 's your following post in / r/russia ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/31bift/reurope_included_russophobia_in_their_new_rules/cq0p2yg ) where you forget about our little conversation to get , i do n't know , sympathy upvotes from the quality userbase of that sub ? 
  as a reminder , this is exactly what i accussed you of :  just like our local sham historian / u/aemilius _ paulus who once agreed with me that there in fact was a genocide after a long discussion , then immediately went to / r/russia to cry about polish people pretending there was a genocide . 
  you ca n't complain about any lies . 
  and by the way , that `` caustic attitude '' is exactly how you speak everytime you get going about your history credentials and unerasonable / r/europe , so the manner i mentioned you in ca n't be the reason , can it ? 
  i think people ( well , definitely me at the very least ) dislike him because of his writing style . 
  most of his posts should have less sentences than they have paragraphs . 
  if you cut out the parts where he introduces his history degree , his qualifications , where he calls everyone else unreasonable and other fluff in [ this post , ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gknmq/78_years_ago_today_polish_operation_of_the_nkvd/ctz7eym ) it 's basically `` i disagree with your definition of genocide because i think it 's too broad . '', 
  that 's one sentence from his blog post of 5 paragraphs . 
  his ** history professors ** from his ** american university ** with a ** varied curriculum on history ** where he ** learned history ** and got his ** degree in history ** and his ** formal training in the field of history ** did n't call it that way when they ** taught him history ** , therefore systematic elimination of national groups is now only genocide when he says it is . 
  did i mention he 's a good leftist and not a russia supporter at all but he ca n't stand idle when the victims of his country call what his country did to them by name because he 's got a ** degree in history ** ? 
   also , if i remember you correctly , you cited a right-wing yale historian with an axe to grind against left-wing politics who is n't even very well accepted in the wider historical scholarly circles on some opinions due to his political bias . 
  the `` director of the genocide studies program '' at an ivy league university is a hundred times better source than a random piece of shit going around / r/europe constantly attacking the victims of his country in every post he makes while inserting a few subtle lies about history and constantly talking about his history degree and how is also a great enlightened leftist and not a russia suporter . 
  then , when the lies are pointed out to you , you completely ignore them in your lenghty followup post and go on insulting the victims of ussr some more . 
  this is a pattern that always repeats you show yourself on this sub . 
  the only person with a visible political bias i see here is you . 
   btw , great bit on framing me with some twisted words and lies [ here 's your post admitting there was a genocide of poles . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30cuip/tartu_estonia_commemorating_the_march_deportation/cpswe2x ) i guess you have a second to delete it now to maintain your narrative . 
  i can not browse your posts from back then anymore because you somehow posted a 1000 times in the last 3 months and reddit wo n't let me go any further , but i distinctly remember you heading to / r/russia right after and bawling about stupid revisionist nationalist poles claiming ussr commited genocide . 
  perfectly demonstrated your general level of honestly , you fucking liar . 
   your vendetta there is no vendetta really , i just happened to remember your antics due to the post above on genocide commited by the soviets and i thought you are a perfect example of a russian revisionist trying to paint the nkvd operations as something else . 
  much better than / r/russia 's clown chewbacca81 who ca n't go for a day without exploding about nato drowning in nuclear fire , at least . 
  ** edit : here 's his bitchy followup post in / r/russia ** : https://pl.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/31bift/reurope_included_russophobia_in_their_new_rules/cq0p2yg, 
   it 's important to remember that genocide ( s ) carried out by bolsheviks were based not only on social ( or class , if you will ) status but also ethnicity . 
  [ some / r/russia posters have a very hard time accepting that . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/3fm0sv/latvia_to_study_material_and_moral_damage/ctqi1ge?context=3 ) just like our local sham historian / u/aemilius _ paulus who once agreed with me that there in fact was a genocide after a long discussion , then immediately went to / r/russia to cry about polish people pretending there was a genocide . 
  why do russians have such a huge problem with accepting that their second empire was evil ? 
  yes, 
  is / u/babywookie actually / u/chewbacca81 's other account , or a copycat ? 
  they both have sw names and very similar views but they both keep posting at the same time, 
  story time ? 
  the attitude of `` every place we 've ever controlled is actually still ours '' reminds me of russia . 
  does n't help . 
  the sticker could very well be read as `` by buying this sanctioned product you are sticking it to putin and his pointless sanctions '', 
  people get abducted from their own countries and prosecuted for random shit frequently ? 
  this event basically destroys any possible argument putinbots or their western supporters could try to make about innocent russia being `` antagonized '' , `` backed into a corner '' and so on . 
  `` dudy '' is also bagpipes in polish, 
  did you mean crusader kings 2 , by chance ? 
  kingdom hearts is a silly game about [ hitting shit with big keys together with disney characters ] ( http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/42/1381734660-kingdom-hearts-2.jpg ), 
  at least it gives hope that the moderate left is now talking about this , i guess . 
  and here i refer you to a [ previous post with which you completely failed to deal with in any way . 
  ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3evzu2/putin_advises_europe_to_be_more_independent/ctjc8kx ) to shortly elaborate what is written in the post above , since you have serious reading comprehension problems : none of the people you mention `` talk about it '' . 
  they talk about more or less harsh measures to get their allies to perform up to certain standards . 
  you talk about unconditionally abandoning the alliance . 
  the brief similiarity of topics does not mean your fringe ideas have any support . 
  the only person actually `` talking about it '' is a guy who wrote a random , lone opinion piece to nyt . 
  opinion pieces do not reflect the views of anybody important , and it was already explained to you . 
   isolationism is a category of foreign policies institutionalized by leaders who asserted that their nations ' best interests were best served by keeping the affairs of other countries at a distance  fringe - something regarded as peripheral , marginal , secondary , or extreme in relation to something else : i know exactly what it means , champ . 
  fits you perfectly . 
  that 's everything , burt ? 
  nothing about my `` hate '' towards america that you made up in your head , your complexes , your failure to prove a single of your claims ? 
   except i did son . 
  for more than i should have , you were wrong . 
  how and how ? 
  last time we spoke , you pretended obama and some other people agree with you because they threatened downsizing of american nato participation under very specific conditions while you want an absolute and unconditional exit from the alliance , then you tried to act like an opinion piece to the nyt was an editorial despite nyt editorials being very clearly marked differently . 
  you do n't get to watch all your arguments fall apart in front of you and claim that you `` defended your view '' . 
   i love your attitude , `` fuck amerikkkkkkka , but please pleae protect us from the bears !!! '', 
  this is exactly what i mean when i say you have a ** massive , gigantic , raging persecution complex ** . 
  burt , america is straight up my favorite country on earth . 
  it 's open to criticism , just like everything else , because nothing 's perfect , but as far as positive contribution to the world goes i think usa has no competitors . 
  ancient greece , maybe ? 
  you do n't represent america and the way i treat you does n't represent what i think about america . 
  the people who get elected to lead your country are generally smart and competent , you are insane isolationist fringe . 
  which is also why you will remain our allies for the foreseeable future , and you will still be insane isolationist fringe , 
  for the last 8 months you are the sole moderator and almost the only content contributor of a dead subreddit with 5 subscribers that apparently only exists to support your persecution complex , and you do n't have the time to defend your central worldview :\\ ^ ) ? 
  i accept this as admission of your defeat and total lack of arguments to support your opinions . 
  i thought americans had more fight in them than that . 
   then you got angry when confronted with evidence . 
  where did that happen ? 
  you misrepresented a bunch of people 's opinions , this was shown to you repeateadly , and then you disappeared with no further arguments :\\ ^ ), 
  [ here , ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3evzu2/putin_advises_europe_to_be_more_independent/ctjc8kx ) you bailed out but we can easily continue your isolationist crusade once you get your shit together and find more ways to pretend obama and defence secretaries share your views, 
  alright burt , i think you 're a moron with a massive persecution complex and you ran away from our last conversation like a little bitch after you could n't pretend anymore that some influential people want to leave nato just like you , but that 's a good one, 
   i told you at the beginning you are n't going to convince me of anything - i know you are wrong . 
  it 's not that we do n't like to boast about history , it 's that we do n't consider what was happening in the glorious rzeczpospolita as colonisation ( whether you agree or not is a different topic ) . 
   foreigners associate russia with [ ... ] bears , haha , absolutely not - bears are impressive creatures . 
  the bear shit mostly comes from your own people and politicians , especially putin repeating the `` do n't back the bear into a corner '' talk all the time with crimea . 
  seriously , putin got pretty fucking creepy with the bear analogies - [ `` sometimes i think that maybe it would be best if our bear just sat still . 
  maybe he should stop chasing pigs and boars around the taiga but start picking berries and eating honey , '' putin said , using the metaphor of the bear as a stand-in for russia . 
  `` maybe then he will be left alone . 
  but no , he wo n't be !, 
  because someone will always try to chain him up . 
  as soon as he 's chained they will tear out his teeth and claws .
