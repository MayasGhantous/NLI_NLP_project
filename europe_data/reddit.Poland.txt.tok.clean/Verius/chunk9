  in this analogy , i am referring to the power of nuclear deterrence . '' ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/18/putin-says-russian-bear-isnt-about-to-sit-back-and-just-eat-berries-and-honey/ ), 
   except for the masses of voters . 
   and the president . 
   and congress . 
  none of those quotes present the opinion that poor nations do n't get to stay in a military alliance with usa regardless of their military spending because they are poor , and none of those quotes present the opinion that leaving nato is the prefered future for america . 
  i believe i 've agreed with these ideas 2 or 3 times already in this discussion . 
  none of these people agree with you and my point stands , no relevant people hold these opinions . 
  if you do n't see the difference between obama saying `` do n't neglect your own military because we 're allied '' and your `` we will leave nato '' then i really ca n't help you and there is nothing else to say . 
   editorials are often classified under the heading `` opinion '' wiki is simply wrong on this one , or it is not a rule - a quick look shows that [ actual editorials are very clearly marked differently on the nyt website ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/the-fantasy-mr-putin-is-selling.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=0 ) ( note how it is not anti-nato at all as well ) so sorry , you still have a single opinion piece of a single author supporting your position . 
  his article is not marked as an editorial and it is not an editorial . 
  email the nyt if you want to prove me wrong :\\ ^ ) . 
   what is it like to be wrong about everything all the time ? 
  you tell me , son . 
   wtf ? 
  no it is n't , you bring nothing to the table to help either of those things and you hinder it . 
  if you do n't see how having allies around the world helps project power globally , i truly do n't know where i should begin to educate you and i wo n't , because i value my time . 
   no one cares about the spending of a poor nation , what do you actually bring to the table ? 
  not a damn thing , you 're a dependent . 
  right , so why the talk about not performing , not reaching spending targets ? 
  isolationism is what interests you , not allies who spend the agreed amounts on military . 
  you lie so that you can pretend obama agrees with you :d ? 
  i am the one doing hyperboles here ? 
  if you are still calm enough to scroll back up , you will find that i never said the idea does not exist . 
  if i 'm wrong , be kind enough to provide a quote where i state this idea does not exist :\\ ^ ) . 
  there are people who literally believe the earth is flat and have a society built around it , why would n't there be people who think leaving nato is the best course of action for the us ? 
  what i have said [ here , ] ( https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3evzu2/putin_advises_europe_to_be_more_independent/ctj3gm6 ) to rephrase it for you , is `` no relevant people hold these opinions '' and i stand by it . 
  you are not relevant . 
  some guy writing opinion pieces to nyt is not relevant . 
  the secretary of defense does not support your opinion , in the extreme and idiotic form you present it in . 
  the secretary reasonably states that if european military spending does not catch up , american support for it will dwindle . 
  that is reasonable and i would never contradict that . 
  if you think i did , please provide a quotation :\\ ^ ) . 
  at no point does he support your insane `` we leave nato now '' . 
  why are you so desperate to pretend like your ideas are validated by powerful people ? 
  note how the current us defense secretary is convinced europe will reach its spending targets and the situation will be resolved positively . 
  i will side with the us defence secretary over this over / u/ltburtreynolds , sorry . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/editorial that would be interesting information if the piece linked by you was an editorial . 
  did you miss `` the opinion pages - room for debate '' written in fairly big letters at the top of the page ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_piece  an opinion piece is an article , published in a newspaper or magazine , that mainly reflects the author 's opinion about the subject . 
   the idea that you said did n't exist where ? 
  unless you can reasonably show how what that guy wrote is the official stance of nyt , we 're done with this one . 
  fucking email them and ask , you seem to have lots of time on your hands , buddy . 
   that would n't happen . 
  if anything nato is a money pit with nothing offering the us . 
  i think nato is crucial to american power projection and domination , and the people in charge seem to agree , since the alliance is maintained and expanded . 
  this is also a different topic that i 'm not interested in talking about with you since you are not a very reasonable person . 
  :d  what the fuck does poland offer us ? 
  why should we protect you ? 
  here it is !, 
  you could 've said that at the beginning and saved us a lot of time . 
  since poland is currently spending 1.9 % gdp and will reach spending of at least 2 % very soon with a recently approved modernisation , you really have no grounds to complain . 
  if you are not interested in maintaining alliances regardless of the spending target , why the bullshit ? 
  your position is completely different from the officials you tried to quote . 
  i feel cheated out of my time now . 
   carter said russian aggression in ukraine , the refugee problem in northern africa and the mass killing at the charlie hebdo satirical magazine in paris were wake-up calls about the need to boost security . 
   `` i think when the cold war ended a lot of europe figured that its security problems had ended . 
  and now they 're beginning to wake up , '' he said . 
   carter acknowledged europe had been slower to recover from the financial crisis than the united states , but he insisted europe still had the means to reach the 2 percent commitment . 
  are we reading the same article ? 
  secretary carter does not share your views at all , he definitely shares mine though . 
  the other guy is harsher but he still does not share your extreme `` lol let 's completely abandon our global military hegemony '' views . 
   hagel was even more explicit at the defense ministers meeting in june when he said `` over-dependence on any one country for critical capabilities brings with it risks . '' how is it that i agree with both of these guys , absolutely disagree with you , and yet you still try to present them as people supporting your insane ideas ? 
   a second ago you said the idea did n't really even exist , now we have the largest paper in the country advocating it . 
  you can admit it , you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  new york times is absolutely not advocating these ideas . 
  do ** you ** know what you 're talking about ? 
  do you understand the concept of an opinion piece ? 
  some a. bacevich is advocating these ideas , not new york times . 
  you 'd have a hard time finding a magazine or paper that did not publish contradicting opinions . 
  judging by the comments under the article you linked , that guy seems to be very lonely with his ideas , even between other nyt writers . 
  your ramblings are still fringe , sorry . 
  i do n't doubt many americans are unhappy with low military spending in europe . 
  why do you think it also means many people think usa should castrate its superpower status and leave nato , i have no idea . 
  one guy commenting on the nyt article heavily supports disbanding nato , and also brings up the idea of organising new crusades against muslim nations . 
  some fine , non-fringe company you have , buddy . 
  the first two links are not about leaving nato , they say european countries should reach the 2 % gdp spending target which i agree with . 
  the clinton link does not mention leaving nato either . 
  so , you have an opinion piece from a liberal newspaper and an opinion piece from a liberal tabloid . 
  looks like usa is really going to abandon nato , oops :\\ ^ ), 
   luckily more people think like me in the us who is that ? 
  you and your local libertarians meeting in some basement ? 
  the extreme left ? 
  which ** relevant ** american political group holds these isolationist views , enlighten me . 
  luckily what you think on this subject is absolutely irrelevant, 
   nato army will rekt you !, 
  well that 's exactly what would happen, 
  it 's when the comments inside are not following the agenda of / r/europe 's mods, 
  i 'm sure that will stop turkey from bombing an aggressive terrorist organization right next to their borders ( in which they are completely justified ) , some people marching in paris, 
  follow this comment chain for answers from an actual turk https://pl.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ehyp0/turkish_warplanes_bomb_pkk_stronghold_in_northern/ctfey3s, 
  turkey strong lol, 
  is that what you 're going to do ? 
  defend a terrorist organization because they happen to share an ideology with you ? 
  left wing certainly is, 
  nobody was a slave in soviet union ahahahaha eesti , latvia , lithuania , did you hear that ? 
  go and have some fun with the russian community in estonia or latvia i guess, 
  why ? 
  not all religions are equal . 
  it is up to romanians to decide which religions/churches are undesirable , not up to you . 
  it does not mean they adopted orthodoxy as an official religion , it means they do n't want islam specifically . 
  they would n't give land to the manson family or the church of satan either , but maybe they would give or already give land to less damaging religions .
