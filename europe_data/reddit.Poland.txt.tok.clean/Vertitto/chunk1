while silesian catholics find warsaw catholics way too radical - since group of people would n't even let the cross near president 's palace ( which was put there after smolensk catastrophe ) be brought back to the church , cause `` they wo n't let anyone take the cross away '' . 
  labeling the cross people `` warsaw 's catholic '' is quite offensive for catholics in warsaw , those were just a bunch of hunted old people as from my region - podlasie ( north-eastern voivodeship ) we make fun of people from bialystok , mostly due to their eastern accent ( similair to bialorussian/russian ) also generally people do n't like warsaw people as they are persived as jerks , thinking that they are better, 
  hyper political correctness is ruining both the language and interactions, 
  they often make holocaust history trips ( [ majdanek camp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/majdanek_concentration_camp ) museum is near lublin ) or to visit old synagogues/cemeteries, 
  kudos for knowing that yes , they 3 are very often seen as one city , in polish they are called `` tr\u00f3jmiasto '' , jokingly it 's said you work in gdansk , sleep in gdynia and party in sopot , 
   various muslim countries ( they study at lublin medical university ) . 
  polish medical universities seem to be popular among them , same thing in gda\u0144sk, 
  flair up, 
  3city / masuria / warsaw immigrants : mostly ukrainians tourists : germans , brits , swedes , + russians , czechs , lithuanians , ukrainians mostly for shoping, 
  i hope never, 
  not really , only some super important matches, 
   waterpolo til that such thing exists, 
  best place to learn about other nations tbh, 
  it 's simple averege depends of types of aglomeration we take into consideration or to be more precise - population density . 
  i believe it 's still quite reasonable to compare germany and poland in this sense ( the population density differs quite much , but culturally they are close ) . 
  it would be bad if you compared a huge low populated agrocultural region with eg . 
  a big metropoly city ( there 's a big difference in lifestyle , number of interaction person has daily etc ) . 
  you would still , however , be able to deduce some facts from it . 
   does n't germany have roughly twice the population of poland ? 
  yes , but still crimes per 100k people . 
  so it does n't matter that much, 
  polish culture and history is like one of the world 's prime armoury for such ammunition : ), 
  in case of poles in uk , they are not so much hated as some other nationalities as poles usually emigrate there to work , not to leach on social system, 
  depends on methodology i guess . 
  still , from what i hear from my friends and foreigners big polish cities ( 3city , warsaw , krakow , poznan , wroclaw etc. ), 
  seem to be way safer than big cities of france or uk , probably mostly due to various immigrants in the western countries, 
   i hate all spanish women over 65 . i guess it 's universall , same can happen in poland , not to mention s.korea where after a certain age you get a privilege to be an asshole, 
  if you want to increase your inner anti-russian watch polish movie [ katy\u0144 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0879843/ ), 
  yea it 's cool one , but it lacks over 800 years of polish history ; p, 
  many western and mediterian europeans get very surprised when they come to eastern europe . 
  old steorotypes coused often by cold war and lack of history knowladge made many people feel bad about that region . 
  complaining nature of polish people does n't help to show how the reality looks like either . 
  you just need to squint your eyes and look closely, 
  cool vid , i like it, 
  or you just watched polish news at that time ; ), 
  yea it 's hilarious , it 's `` better '' argumented `` future of europe/world '' - type of yt vid . 
  entertaining to listen to ; ), 
  some circlejerk thing http://www.wielkarzeczpospolita.net/, 
  some context ? 
  ekhm , you mean [ this ] ( http://www.wielkarzeczpospolita.net/img/mapa_big.jpg ) + [ mars colonies ] ( http://www.wielkarzeczpospolita.net/img/mapamarsa_big.jpg ), 
  20min is n't tl ; dr oppose to ~ 10h book ? 
  if that was your intention i would have to disagree . 
  there are quite well prospering cities that was made just becouse `` lol i want a city here '', 
  best part of that is that polan stronk !, 
  / edit : [ tl ; dr of the book to listen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpakt5ynpea ) for fun, 
  would be nice to use title for what it 's for , not some random , pointless comment, 
  and sort things out with kurds, 
   the un estimates that white people will be a minority in europe by 2100 , and much sooner in places like america and canada . 
   this is a tribute to the european civilization and the white race . 
  from science to art to sports to literature to exploration , the white european race has been on the vanguard of human accomplishment . 
  is it just me or comment under the vid sounds quite `` white power '' - ish, 
   artificial cities are hit ** and ** miss or *, 
   you first task is ** to build ** a new capital . 
  i guess it 's the key word here, 
  expectation ai n't high i see ; ), 
  how you could forgte about this : [ poland wins fivb men 's world championship 2014 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcgox-d9fkw ), 
  never heard such thing, 
  it 's already changing , lol, 
  - politically : member of the western world ( eu , nato ) - culturally : catholic church tradition , latin alphabet etc - geographically : center of europe is either in belarus or in lithuania , both east of poland ( european part of russia and ukraine have pretty big territory ) only small cold war divide is what putting us in east it 's not west either couse : - economically - we still not there - geographically - not there either - historically - we mendled mostly in our surrounding , usually east , south , north directions that 's why central is a suitable term, 
  south-north is pretty much a gradiual change from mountains to flatlands east-west is wealth & political divide : west + big cities is generally wealthier and more liberal, 
   jesus why do you guys always make such a fuss it 's simply wrong on so multitude of levels, 
  i do n't think it 's a standard , i guess it 's just a matter of place, 
  is it really different in any country in europe ? 
  but if you include one you should do the same with other, 
  sounds like guide for americans not europeans / s only the early closing hour is surprising for me, 
  [ not-eastern-europe group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) ( visegr\u00e1d group , link to wiki ) ; ), 
  it misses weimar triangle ( france , germany and poland ), 
  counting uk and ireland as northen europe was always weird to me . 
  like come on , how can you be northen if you close schools becouse it snows ... 
  the thing with using believe constructions in polls you tend to get quite big random answers since different people read the question differently . 
  that can produce weird results . 
  you cut off that variance with direct questions imo, 
  so do we ( english/german first and english/german/french / russian later ) but not in primary school, 
  hmm it 's strange for poland since foreign lang is compulsory in the primary school - you have a test from it at the end . 
  i hate the `` believe '' question construction - it should be `` is there x '' . 
  believing is pretty ambivalent term that can mean anything from `` i 'm sure x is '' to `` i think it 's possible that x may be '', 
  it would be pretty hard - what would you even count for eg . 
  poland which previous state was plc - people who call themselves polish ? 
  who lived in plc ? 
  who lived in the crown ? 
  who speak polish ? 
  who had polish parents ? 
  what about polish jews ? 
  do you count lithuanians , belarusians and ukrainians as poles too ? 
  it 's almost like russian version of jack the reaper, 
  as for statistical 8 people per town there 's pretty bad news - most of the refugees are supposed to be placed in few towns in eastern poland ( podlasie : around \u0141om\u017ca , czerwony b\u00f3r and bialystok ) . 
  if that 's true then good luck with finding work for them or any form of integration . 
  their name sounds like some clan from mmo games, 
   terrorists attack are going to be a casual thing in europe western europe *, 
  what really stuck in my mind from moomins is little mi voice , she 's really annoying in polish - at least it matches that little shit 's character, 
  seems pretty random to me even witcher3 is more accurate ... 
  jewish freemason reptilians, 
  holly shit , movie lists of some of those are really long, 
   slavic brothers  hungary really ? 
  well not entirely without damage to city , but not at such scale as in west, 
  hard to say what 's a lot and meaningful on fb - event can have milion of likes and only 5 people may show up . 
  how are facebook likes relevant in any way ? 
  nope , that 's pretty much what most right wing portals ( football fans are usually in right-far right spectrum ) are saying - terrorism or planned islamisation of europe ( or both ), 
  not if they see it as supporting terrorism, 
  that 's not so dumb as it may seem at first - very often getting finned gives you `` negative points '' or simply puts you in reginster of some sort,
