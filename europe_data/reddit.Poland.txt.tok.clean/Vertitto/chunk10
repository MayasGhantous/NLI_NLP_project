  there are probably some minor legal implications ( eg . 
  being able to get info about the person in hospital etc ) , but if you want to , you can have those things without the marrige status as well . 
  only important thing i can think of is adopting children - dunno how it looks there - it may be a seperate issue anyway, 
  compared to economic problems ( subsidies , budget , pensions etc ) , safety or law regarding government , companies , owndership etc - not really . 
  compared to those it 's just a petty issue that applies only to very small part of the society - pretty much a semantic issue for a country where homosexuals are treated with respect . 
  it 's more of a symbolic act that anything else . 
  wasted time and money on referendum imo, 
  polish blue spots are something like [ this ] ( http://www.poznaj-swiat.pl/upload/artykuly/podlasie_rzeczpospolita_wielu_narodow%281%29.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.letniogrod.eu/img/001.jpg ) - forests , lakes , rivers and fields with small towns/villages sprinkled here and there, 
  apparently not since instead of spreading across the country they congregate in few areas, 
   this is a european reddit , but it is dominated by eastern european topics , sometimes it feels like the leading european country is poland , romania or the uk , and not germany and france . 
  well duh , ofc polan is most important in the eu, 
  if people reacted the same for important matters it would be awesome, 
  podlasie , \u0141om\u017ca-suwa\u0142ki ( i ' v heard it used more in suwa\u0142ki region ) - though i ' v heard various names for that , it 's almost as if each familiy had their own name for it . 
  very often we call it just sa\u0142atka , as `` default '' salad, 
   south america 's uruguay beats most european countries . 
  only 53 responders though, 
  i wonder if it 's corrected with averege person 's happines in the country - i mean that it could be that it 's same as general happiness or can even be higher than the national averege , but still low compared to other countries, 
  all the attention is on 2nd round of presidential elections here - voting is on sunday, 
  that thing has like milion names everywhere , in my home region we call it `` kaczy \u017cer '' ( duck feeding , lol ), 
  polish : - [ ryba po grecku ] ( http://smakowitykasek.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ryba_po_grecku.jpg ) ( fish in the ** greek ** - style ) - fish in carrot `` dressing '' - [ sa\u0142atka grecka ] ( http://static.ilewazy.pl/wp-content/uploads/salatka-grecka-250g.jpg ) ( ** greek ** salad ) - sos tatarski ( ** tatar ** 's sauce ) - [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartar_sauce ) - tatar ( steak ** tartare ** ) - [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steak_tartare ) - lody w\u0142oskie ( ** italian ** icecreams ; soft serve ) - [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soft_serve ) - belgijki ( ** belgian ** fries ) - [ fries , but cut into bigger pices ] ( http://my3miasto.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/belgijki.jpg ) those came to my mind atm, 
  stats do n't lie , you need to invest more in eastern polan, 
  i do n't think it 's a thing . 
  there are various courses that may lead you to game design eg . 
  coding in various languages , 2d-3d animation or graphic , music etc. 
  way more than eg . 
  does the view differ when it comes to americans and europeans ? 
  are there any specific steorotypes when it comes to european nationalities or are they viewed rather as general europe or western ? 
   politicians push to increase this number even further through lowering requirements . 
  this cancer also happens in poland, 
  catholic - you got the plc , orthodox - you get russia ( at some point they were ok with catholic though ) and protestant - sweden ; how fucked up the religion is ... 
  had vasa made better decisions the commonwealth might include sweden , russia and bohemia , he kind of fuck up on all 3 fronts ; (, 
  we had elective system for some time - we basically hired guys to be kings and rule the country ; [ list of polish monarchs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_polish_monarchs ) if curious, 
  switch places with sigismund iii vasa : - not turn folk in moscow against me - take russian throne when it was possible so that romanov dinasty never happens - spread privilages more evenly in the kingdom ( so that cossacs stop being a pain in the ass ) - invest in science and reforms ( mainly to switch from agriculture to industry slowly ),

  one good thing came from it - exporters got forced to diversify their clients and take intersts in new markets . 
  no way they would do that without the embargo . 
  imo it 's here to stay just imagine space polan : `` we are the first to mine asteroids '' , public response : `` yea cool , overpriced tech , what dumb people are leading it ? 
  it could have been done 10 time faster and cheaper , why are ships grey ? 
  it 's sad , china is planing to mine in two years , you will see how cool it can be done ... '', 
  considering our nominal value it 's definitly now enough, 
  in poland private school are ok pretty much only for languages or some speciallised curses like drawing for architecture ( there are few exceptions though ) . 
  private universities are looked down upon especially - it means that you were not good enough to get to one of the public ones and are essentially paying for degree paper noone even takes seriously . 
  once a while there are voices to scrap private unis from the right to give diplomas ( bachelors , engineer , masters etc ) - it would be heavily for such change there 's also the bologna system that is said to be a cancer for higher education here , but that 's another story tl ; dr : public all the way , private suck in poland ( there are ofc few exceptions ), 
  no idea , from my expirience they are not that popular, 
  from more interesting things : ~ 16-17 century poland had many middle eastern inflances eg . 
  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/stanislaw_antoni_szczuka_%281652_1654-1710%29.jpg ) was polish noble costume and we were using sabres oppose to western rapiers, 
  3 little pigs story would n't work then, 
  why have german oblast outside germany then ? 
  you do n't want polan ? 
  how nice of you ; ), 
  eee that does n't count, 
  did swedes have moscow at all ? 
  i do n't see moldova on this map , there 's just some blank spot , a fairyland ; ), 
  want to border polan again so much ? 
  wow your ilustrations are `` generous '', 
  i guess you ment [ this ] ( http://sz-n.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4e23d4a230b1be45a15d96f9b13b7551641000.jpg ), 
  never heard of it : ), 
  so who gets the cool town and who the rest ? 
   we did n't get murdered , and 12-year-old me fell in love with the country . 
  you do n't need much ; ), 
   also a black guy make fun of me because one of my bags was half purple . 
  `` that is a nice pink color bag you had there '' the very first words a native english speaker ever said to me . 
  sounds very polish . 
  there 's a saying here that men know 3 colours : ok one , gay one and not-ok one , 
  you could force people to have children [ evil laughter ], 
  different kind , but yes ; ), 
  yey polan was not marked as russia , such win , 
  i 'm not sure if you are serious or i 'm getting trolled, 
  it 's just a theory , duh, 
  well duh , ofc russians were victims of revolutions . 
  the thing is they they are very often proud of their grim history ( very often from ignorance , not even knowing the whole picture ), 
  how does eu or countries in europe cope with terrorism threats ? 
  thank you russia for all the great composers ( rachmaninoff , czajkowski , musorgski , szostakowicz etc ), 
  wars with turks , russians and swedes led to us bleedeing out . 
  the deluge alone nearly did it alone . 
  partitions are just cheerry on the cake, 
  high five to dutch , swiss , estonians , finns and germans soon after yurop stronk !, 
  so wrong  the germans really do n't like poles , and among germany 's 9 neighbors , are disliked the most . 
  i do n't think it 's true any more . 
   do n't like czechs , slovaks or lithuanians either nope ? 
   you never , ever hear jokes about germans in poland . 
  lol you could just scrap the poland thing entirely, 
  literally yeasterday ... http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35kn45/what_is_the_most_beautiful_small_villagetown_in/, 
  also poland and ethnicities inside ( eg . 
  belarusians ) a bit complicated to write it in one sentence, 
  still very vague , nearly meaningless, 
   a cultural union what does that even mean ? 
  one thing about kievian ru\u015b for westerners - it 's neither russia , belarus nor ukraine . 
  you can look at it as an entity , ruins on which those states/nationalities got created , a predecessor of sorts . 
  / edit there are also mistakes on the maps eg . 
  size of poland in 1500, 
  i bursted with laugh reading the title . 
  it 's so childish, 
  as for now only one comes to my mind ( i will be adding ) - [ beats of freedom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jafjzxi0hio ) - cool documentary about polish music scene during communism ( lot about history and society in that period ) - [ polish muslims : an unexpected meeting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhvdtiuxfvg ) ( dunno if it 's good though - [ who really invented vodka ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr_37f6hhte ) ( got many upvotes on yt ) - not a doc but great portal-presentation about pre-mid-after ww2 warsaw - [ warsawrising ] ( http://www.warsawrising.eu/ ),
