  they look more official with it, 
  i 'm ok with the one we got for a fency pick i would get the plc-design , but with polish only coa - something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mn1tbk0.png ) ( best paint skills ever ) , it looks cool as banner, 
  it would be cool if patents were n't so fucking expensive, 
  looks exactly the same here, 
  hard to see the front page ? 
   royalties for commercial use of the `` red poppies '' melody are paid - through german organization of collective management of copyright gema - to free state of bavaria ( germany ) , which - according to german law - acquired copyright after the childless death of alfred schutz and his wife in munich as their heir http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_red_poppies_on_monte_cassino, 
  being polish it 's a bit weird to read an opionion stating that poland is is some way united - national holidays are celebreted in various groups where non wants to be even close to another , parties accuse themselves of trason etc, 
  what will you say about [ this ] ( https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/t31.0-8/10866173_405970496245655_7168065869422812846_o.png ) ? 
  english + wo n't hurt if you will know few basic words of the native lang ( eg . 
  hi , sorry , thx ), 
  iirc folk songs got something around the line of national haritage and they can not be ip ( i may be wrong though ), 
  i love polish name flexability, 
  full results will be know tomorrow or on tuesday, 
  i 'm not worried about that couse very often those are high schoolers/first years students who got no life expirience or knowladge of anything , whose opinion changes on monthly basis, 
   anna seems to be universal good female name, 
  some names are ok only in their cultural circle . 
  when they got put into foreign circle they get different feel, 
  i can not tell how serious he is about some things , that 's why i ' v put him along those two, 
  what 's really scarry that people like korwin , braun or kowalski are able to get so many votes, 
  dunno , most of my friends , family say they will vote for komorowski, 
  it 's only 2 % , that 's so small that it can easly get reversed tomorrow , that 's only a poll , not firm results . 
  but yes , big dip nonetheless, 
   kukiz is now the key player one time star imo , just a symbol for people wanting a change , nothing more . 
  they are look down upon couse : - they sound blunt and horrendous paired up with polish surnames - make impression that one is ashamed of his roots - sounds douchey , as if the parents got some ego problem , trying to make their children 's name `` cool '' or `` international '' - there was a trend for this when first american soap operas got into tv, 
  it 's really a name ? 
  in polish it has only one meaning ... 
  some yes , but naming a child eg . 
  telesfor would be considered child abuse nowdays, 
   antoni or stanis\u0142aw used to be quintessential old people 's names . 
  those are normal names though , i mean the anachronic names that you can only see on the calendar, 
  you mean geralt ( as in witcher ) ? 
  it 's rather old one ( medival old ) of german origin , not used anymore  is it equivalent to george ? 
  nope . 
  equivalent to george would be jerzy, 
  i liked our from [ last year ] ( http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/arpmon6_700b_v4.jpg ) way more, 
  dunno for best , but among the worst are two types imo : - american-sounding names like eg . 
  axel , kevin , jessica , angelica etc - really old names * eg . 
  eustachy , gotard , gizela , bonifacy , bonawentura , apolinaria or euzebiusz etc. 
  there is a split for slavic names ( eg . 
  s\u0142awomir , stanis\u0142aw , miros\u0142aw , bogus\u0142aw , jaros\u0142aw , w\u0142odzimierz etc ) - some people view them as a bit `` redneck '' ( from the lack of better word ) . 
  personally , i like them . 
  on a side note , recently i ' v found quite unique , polish name that is very rarely used in day2day basis - my degree paper reviewer was named jagienka ( what 's surprising it 's how she had it in her documents - jagienka , not jagna ) . 
  / edit : * some examples were a bit off , by old i mean the old weird ones that are not in circulation since dunno how long , those that you only seen on calendars and you ask yourselves if people actually use those, 
  in 3city ( gda\u0144sk , sopot , gdynia ) it 's english , german , swedish and russian from my expirience, 
   at worst it gets somewhere to -25 c baltic has some good effect here ; ) here in poland ( aside from the coast ) we got quite big continental climate influence - we can get almost siberian-like cold ( -35 ` c , little to no wind then though ), 
  that one was really weird, 
  [ version for poland ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/annaneyman/27-reasons-you-should-never-visit-poland#.yoym4myvkk ), 
  portal, 
  you need to look up what internetz people made - [ magda og\u00f3rek-hime ] ( https://www.facebook.com/magdachanhime?fref=ts ) , pure gold, 
  you got no idea how bad their `` debate '' was few days ago , some elementary school acted debates are more professional and natural, 
  i just imagined the guy living alone in one of the `` one-person '' countries, 
  and in few days we got presidential elections in poland, 
  well in europe on day to day basis people also do n't call middleeastern people white, 
   child mortality rate how is this any kind of indicator ? 
  to expand on this : http://www.warsawrising.eu/ ( excellent portal-presentation by warsaw rising museum that shows warsaw before , during and after ww2 , lot of archival photos , videos , recordings and stats ; do n't turn off the music - it creates great vibe ), 
   one guy two *, 
  based on may expertise i can say : yep , those are tanks , different kinds of tanks . 
  i expected specific products ... 
   annoying ads adblock, 
  it depends on the day - it can work flawless , but it sometimes make me want to punch the screen, 
  there 's ~ 5-10 % chance of it crushing and freezing the browser or whole pc for ~ 10-15s when opening new tab with something that uses flash . 
  it 's pain in the ass for someone who watches lot of streams or yt, 
   i already use it for facebook and youtube because they keep freezing my pc in chrome , same thing happens here on firefox - flash plugins are crusing all the time, 
  i keep firefox alive !, 
  it 's hema ( historical european martial arts or wma - western amrtial arts ) not some larp cosplay . 
  which means it 's actual real fencing , which is based mostly on old treatises/fighting manuals . 
  i prefer 1v1 competition than team ones , as weapons seem to be `` pretty useless '' ( they work only as clubs or leverage assistants ) in team rounds . 
  it 's in gdynia which is part of tricity ( gda\u0144sk , sopot & gdynia ) so aside from the festival you will have great place for sights ( gda\u0144sk ) and partying ( sopot ) . 
  also on top of that the tricity aglomeration is at the sea, 
  poland i know about these : - [ przystanek woodstock ] ( http://woodstockfestival.pl/en/woodstock_festival/woodstock_life ) - biggest in poland , happens each year , geners : rock , blues , metal , reggee , rap , various combinations ; lot of additional things like panels etc. 
  ( 30.07 - 01.08 ) - [ open ` er ] ( http://opener.pl/en ) ( 1-4 .07.2015 ) look up youtube for those, 
   not one of those links was the same as mine it does n't fucking matter . 
  all of those are about the same things . 
  it 's repost after repost , non of them bring nothing new . 
  it 's as if i just posted `` putin bikers refused entry to poland '' on my fb and linked it here , it does n't make the entry new , it 's just another repost, 
   only 1 other discussion one is enough also really just one ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/341xg6/russian_biker_gang_night_wolves_refused_entry/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/341zty/russian_proputin_bikers_turned_back_at_polish/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/341ww8/poland_denies_entry_to_russian_bikers_putin/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33wocp/russian_bikers_start_ride_toward_berlin_despite/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33q4l2/poland_wont_allow_night_wolves_to_ride_through/ those are only few in regards to denial of entry , not to mention dozens of more regarding the issue, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyvgvkkt0ow ) is pretty cool ( aside from the `` white power at the end '' ) also [ poland is beautiful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbu_frg8vuu ) + [ poland from above ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms25ntllvuw ), 
  yey science !, 
  oh i did n't know that , thx i 'm used to seeing [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/new_donetsk_peoples_republic_flag.svg/900px-new_donetsk_peoples_republic_flag.svg.png ), 
  what 's up with the confederacy flag ? 
  i got no problems with them joining as soon as they fulfill the requirements, 
  if i recall correctly it 's complete bullshit , a map pulled out of ass . 
  someone posted it on / mapporn some time ago, 
   those country balls ... polan is wrong , arms , eye pupils literally cancer, 
  just fluff, 
   soviet union in whole soviet block back then you also had some special occasion dumb costumes to represent your work or school, 
  what problem do they have with expo ? 
  best kind of work-free day where you do n't really celebrate anything , just enjoy a longer weekend ; ) also [ my hometown is even better ] ( http://4lomza.pl/foto/2015/05/150501104940.jpg ), 
  `` heavily '', 
  [ biblioteka ] ( http://imgur.com/oumtrs0,on9pxiu#0 ) ( 2 pics : two slightly different zooms ), 
  pointless map are you awere it shows random libraries , map will change drastically when you move the map a bit or zoom in/out ? 
  i imagie you could find your questions already answered on / r/travel, 
  cruel , sadistic entertainment , imo should be banned, 
  only in some privete houses, 
  my home town : 2 my current city : 19 so clean ; ), 
  it does n't metter if you can manouver well ( do n't get me wrong , it 's good skill to have ) , what matters is knowladge of rules and obaying them so that the road clock goes smooth , so that others can without problem predict what are you going to do on the road, 
  my goal here is not to take any sides here , but to just explain in eli5 way what an union of this kind is and what some basic concerns may be, 
   seems good . 
  well , not for all eg .
