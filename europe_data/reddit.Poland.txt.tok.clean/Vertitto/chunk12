  let 's make a simple case of union for two countries : germany and poland ( i will make number out of my ass just to highlight one aspect ) before : germany pays 30 per unit where poland pays 60 after : both pay 40 each is it worth for germany to pay 10 more just for some leverage and to help the neighbour ? 
  the union is problematic for countries who got very good contracts atm and they plan to have good relations with providers and got their sources quite diversified ( like germany ) . 
  union buys energy ( in form of eg . 
  oil or gas ) as one country . 
  in such case the provider can not stop supplying or rise prices for individual members of the union . 
  it gives leverage in negotiations and what 's the biggest problem for some members - the price gets averaged , so you may end up paying more than you had before, 
  yea sure , couse people do n't get kidnapped in europe ... 
  the fact that i can be friends with koreans and do business with them doesn mean i share all other aspects as well, 
  couse europe is not a country , everywhere is looks different , it even differes from region/town to region/town . 
  you essentially made a non-thread - asked for something , but really nothing, 
  ask at your host country reddit sub, 
  but , but but ... it 's mordor , where are the orcs ? 
  i dunno how prevelant it is , but i noticed that smoking in relation to sex changed - it used to be that men were the smokers , recently i ' v noticed that it 's the women are the majority of smokers ( we observed that with friends at uni ) / edit : also there 's ton of people smoking e-cigarettes, 
  quick search : - unshaved men can not partake in rescue missions - it 's forbidden to photograph railway stations - 30 day arrest for using foreign lang in naming goods , adverts or manuals - it 's forbidden to carry hidden blades ( eg . 
  hidden in a staff or umbrella ) ; it 's perfectly fine though if it 's not hidden - men with noticable disability can not apply to study at the priest seminar - food donated by companies is taxed - it 's cheaper to just throw it out than eg . 
  donate it to homeless shelter - loans inside the closest familiy are also taxed - ordering alcohol from abroad via internet is taxed ( excise ) , but if you bring it by yourself it 's not - if a driver has perpetual driving license and he exchange it for the same type foreign license that has expiration date then he can not get perpetual polish license any more [ source in polish ; article from ' 08 ] ( http://interia360.pl/polska/artykul/najwieksze-absurdy-prawne,7911 ) ( translations are flawed , feel free to correct , i 'm to lazy to make better one at 2 am ; link has also 30 other from around the world ) / edit : also : - in cracow it was forbidden to collect chestnuts, 
  why anyone cares ? 
  it 's nothing but an aimless circlejerk, 
  seems to be a pretty universal dysfunction, 
  everyone are talking about everything on reddit , what 's your problem ? 
  calling romas as gypsies or cyganie ( or any derivative of those ) would help romanians, 
  come on , invite a roma into house ? 
  really ? 
  i 'm confused - were they roma or romanian ? 
  article seems to use both terms, 
  what perspective is that ? 
  i 'm looking at the google view and i can not figure out where is it on the map, 
  you also can auction activities like that on christmas charity ( wo\u015ap ) that is organised each year, 
  weekly repost strikes again, 
  poland : how much does x cost in poland : - kwh ( energy cost ) - gram of gold - gram of marihuana - gbp shorter question : how much does x cost : - eur - usd - passport - gbp, 
  that 0,1 % though, 
  there 's no point in investing in such things since you are so small , they cost a lot per capita and in case of war do not achieve anything , it 's better to spent that money in some other way eg . 
  on special forces or at non-military things like healthcare or education, 
  oh that 's like ~ 3rd time this week , cool, 
  so nice of you ; ), 
  so much butthurt at least he 's not mad at polan ; ), 
   i 'm used to westerners using this rhetoric but seeing it come from poland of all places is weird the `` our eastern border is where civilisation ends '' starts from germany , then there 's poland , belarus and russia are kind of together here and for them civilisationd ends at ural mountains  they were civilized because they were catholics ? 
  the eastern you went , the less urbanised area it was, 
  i gathered them in a jar and when it got to around ~ 20pln bill i went to bank to exchange it over the last year i ' v nearly cut off entirely usage of cash so the problems is pretty much gone, 
  but no rhyme ; (, 
  most importantly we do n't have the new-earth creationism crap, 
   and the bible belt thing as well . 
  our bible belt is completley different beast, 
  if this line of thought interests you there 's one venue for that : f. nietzsche . 
  he believed to had had some polish roots , due to that he got interesed in polish culture and may got hucked up on the idea of sarmatism . 
  ( nothing about the sarmantism part on wiki , you may look up some nietzsche-specific books to check that if you are interested ) this may have had some impact on his superhuman concept ( though sarmantism does n't have any `` i 'm better than them '' aspect afaik ) , which later unfortunately inflanced nazism . 
  [ wiki part about that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_nietzsche#citizenship.2c_nationality.2c_ethnicity ) it 's a ** big leap ** though as it 's just an attempt to play devil 's advocate and fit some pices into your idea . 
  i would n't take it seriously, 
  never heard such thing , polish nobility was said to inherit love of freedom , hospitality , bonhomie , bravery and courage as sarmatian characteristics i 'm no specialist i know what i got from school + wiki on this matter . 
  best way is to ask on / r/askhistorians or some cultural-oriented sub, 
   according to sarmatism , the polish nobility descended not from slavs , like the rest of the poles , but from sarmatians . 
  this was supposed to give the nobility ownership rights over the poles , because the sarmatians had allegedly once conquered poland . 
  not really - sarmatians supposedly came to this lands in ancient times and we are their decendands . 
  some french chronicler from x century ( flodoard ) was calling slavs as sarmatians . 
  later few others books we writtien and kind of circlejerk began . 
  there 's more detail and sources on polish side of the wiki, 
  this recent poland circlejerk as if / r/europe was going through polish school system i can not wait to see people recording themselves reciting [ invocation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78yfuwdvpc8 ) from [ `` pan tadeusz '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_tadeusz ) by adam mickiewicz ; d, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be are there any other countries that got such friendship-is-magic rhymes ? 
  getting also turkey to the party would be cool, 
  i thought the comment was about the middle class concept in general, 
   and middle class do not use public transport and why is that ? 
  it 's the best way of transport in many cities, 
  for me it sounds like post-communist chemical company, 
  i do n't believe it 's just some dumb conspiracy, 
   is a pr slogan invented by politicians and banksters to differentiate v4 countries from the rest of eastern europe yea started in xiv century , which the currect group imitates eastern europe has 2 major characteristics - uses cyrilic alphabet and is orthodox also strictly geographically center of europe is eastwards of poland - in belarus or lithuania depending on how you count our region got characteristics ** of both east and west ** and therefore it 's better to call it central http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe, 
  definitly yes - as much as french , english , german or spanish, 
  there 's always bag-on-the-head option, 
   there is no reason to be ashamed of it it 's wrong in each possible way aside from historical cold war east-west divide, 
  they you could still soome sexy , working body and transplant your head onto it :d, 
  indians to have closer culture than east europeans ? 
  they were under british rule , but to say that their culture is closer to british than european , quite a leap, 
  from curiosity - what is an allience then ? 
  i though it 's a cooperation in order to achieve some common goal ( dictionary definition ), 
  the '' - orsz\u00e1g '' suffix is added randomly to countries or is there some rule by which countries get it ? 
  so if i say a square is a rectangle i 'm wrong ? 
  same principle if i understand it correctly also it 's not only a non-aggression pact , it also entails coordination of invasion , quite similar to partitions that happened before, 
  for future : polish units were fighting at pretty much all fronts/major battles, 
  ofc , allience is a wider term , but still contains the pact  an alliance is a pact , coalition or friendship between two or more parties , made in order to advance common goals and to secure common interests by wiki  a group of countries , political parties , or people who have agreed to work together because of shared interests or aims by cambridge dictionary, 
  the pact is what makes this allience formal ... 
  `` we split the territory over there , you do n't hit me and i do n't hit you , k ? 
  deal '' sounds like allience for me, 
  speak : - polish - english - bit of german and swedish ( had only around 2-3 semesters of each at highschool/uni ) would like to : - get better at german and swedish - korean ( for now i know the alphabet ) - arabic or farsi ( persian ), 
   so the ussr and nazi germany were allies now ? 
  for a lil yes , and it 's nothing new . 
  [ molotov -- ribbentrop pact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  both planned to backstab eachother , hitler was first though, 
  soon ; ), 
  yea sometimes he has some merit here and there , but general advise is taking everything what he says with a big grain of salt, 
   about foreign politics . 
  about anything tbh, 
  i would love if those were specialists in the filed first as opposed to politicians , do n't care about nationality - for me it can be a hired guy from mongolia as long as he 's good at what he 's supposed to do, 
  hmm road infrastructure , buildings ( more steel-glass buidlings , most communistics blocks got repainted etc ) as it 's the first thing you see . 
  from more people orienteded things - use of electronic devices ( smartphones/tablets ) on the streets and more foreigners, 
  pretty much everything , each 10-15 is almost a completely different country . 
  it 's cool to see reactions of family/friends who visit poland once for few years . 
  2015 - quite the west european standard , modern country 2000 - already not communistics , but not yet modern , kind of limbo 1985 - full on communism lot happened over last 45 years , i guess all ex-eastern block countries feel same about the this changes, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/germany http://www.reddit.com/r/berlin, 
  the swedish deluge still counts ? 
  you missed the point - it 's not giving random land , but land where russians live, 
   beer is horrible .
