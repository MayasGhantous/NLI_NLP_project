  correct, 
  english name of the river sounds weird, 
  yes i 'm awere of that , but the confict highlighted the problems in the region , that 's just opinion of this small aspect of the conflict, 
  i base my opinion mainly on after ww2 forced poland-germany resettlements expiriences - they were painful for the first generation , but worked out wonderfully in the long term . 
  russian-ukrainian is a bit more complicated though as the nationalities are much closer and mixed, 
  probably , politics is a scary place but that 's just opinion about this part of the conflict, 
  my would be that eastern ukraine should be given to russia - imo it being ukraine is fail of ussr collapse . 
  it should be given in a longer ( like a decade or two ) , peaceful process so that people can migrate and settle up without tensions ( ukrainians moving to western part and russians from ukraine moving to the region ) . 
  it 's a disgrace what happened to the region ( look how donetsk looked for euro2012 ) , ukraine is becoming somalia of europe , and relations with russia went to shit / edit : i 'm awere of various implications and complexity of the russian-ukrainian conflict . 
  it 's just opinion on small aspect of the conflict in order to give and gather various povs and info .

  i hope we wo n't enter euro in the nearest future - we have very solid , stable currency - we have good supervision over it - we need cheaper currency just like greece - our industry-export advantage is based on cheap labour force , not on high technology-innovation yet , euro would just hinder our pretty much only market advantage mayby in 20 or 30 years , for sure not in the next 5-10 years, 
  i find it pretty cool, 
  well , wars ; ), 
  - grown from ancient greek & roman + christian tradition - pretty much all capitals - hmm may be good , but when i hear europe i think of multiple languages - pretty much already got the identity - look up how europeans behave being in eg . 
  asia - they bond with other europeans ( or general westerners ) just like people do with their nationalities when emigrating ( both from own will and surrounding pressure - eg . 
  chinese wo n't say oh you are from germany or sweden , they will say form europe or us ), 
  wow hungary  polan had not expected that, 
   all the loot we stole from poland , germany , egypt and elsewhere .

  i had that under social culture in mind, 
  it 's often sign of lack of vocabulary . 
  i was always taught to use either use one lang or another , do not mix if possible . 
  it also sounds horrible,

  ashamed : - `` true polish '' nationalists - still lagging behind social and political culture ( eg . 
  cleaning after your dog or dumb argument-less politics ) - political influence of church - stuck in past mentality - national victimhood mentality - more is spoken/celebrated about the failures than about victories - language mixing ( i absulutely hate it ) - corpo-mowa , where you mix english with polish eg . 
  by\u0142em na meetingu , zjad\u0142em lunch , ide na shopping etc. 
  - minor thing that annoys me a little - i guess it 's communism-related thing - polish culture got squized to folk as if it was the major representation of polish culture , kind of belittled in a way proud : - long , full of everything , complicated history - quite unique language ( and a derivative - literature ) - great music ( classical music is not as rich as austro-german or russian , but still ; i love polish interwar music and rock from ~ ' 80 - ~ '90 along with sung poetry ), 
  those two are synonims . 
  depends what country decides to use, 
   poland : we really do n't need a border to russia . 
  out . 
  if it 's the reason for no , 
  - 1st commwealth : the one you thought about first - the commonweath of two nations ( polish-lithuanian commonweath ) - 2nd commwealth - poland from the interwar period - 3rd since '89 ( fall of communism ), 
  fun fact : poland is commonwealth atm , full name is the 3rd commwealth of poland ( iii rzeczpospolita polska ), 
  or they can just hug their beloved kebab ; ), 
  they are balitics now, 
  would be great if you first said/flair where are you from, 
  also germany , podlasie, 
  and then there 's gdp per capita ... 
  they got facts from time to time , also it 's good to read different things, 
  w and v is the same sound , but v looks dumb, 
  lol, 
  at least you read what is writtien , not like in french or english, 
  it lacks polish letters though well i wonder why \u00f3 gets used but others like \u0142 , \u017c , \u017c , \u0107 etc are not ... 
  there 's some blasphemy law in poland ? 
  that depends on how well the questioned people pool was made, 
  we got small muslim minority in podlasie region ( north-eastern part ) , but they are tatars who are assimilated to the point they are not seen as muslim in the same sense as arabs , turks or n.africans, 
  well , it would be strange if muslim hated themselves, 
  https://youtu.be/3tajpgfriai?t=2m8s map got me rustled, 
  too many to even give an example ... cool, 
  ofc, 
  monarchy nope , price is title reffered to member of an noble family from few lineages we have some noble families eg . 
  \u017byli\u0144scy , czartoryscy , zamoyscy , lutos\u0142awscy , potoccy , kurcewicze , radziwi\u0142\u0142owie , lubomirscy or sapiehowie ( some are mixed polish-lithuanian ), 
  how many more times will it be posted ? 
  once some old drunk guy on bus mumbled something about jews . 
  in addition standard whitepower-antisemite slogans by football hooligans . 
  also when i was a kid i remember people were rather wary thowards refugees from chechnya in my town , but tbh there were reasons to be as they were notoriously close to criminal world . 
  we also had few families from azerbaijan/georgia , but everyone was ok with them in general universal thing - anti-gypsy mentality - but only thowards the begging/stealing/slums ones .

   how would that sound ? 
  it may be tricky since not all languages use latin alphabet . 
  http://www.wykop.pl/ , it 's mostly fluff though, 
  hard to say since we do n't use maple syrup at all . 
  if it works it 's ok i guess, 
   covered in this cream called smetana this is how you eat sweet pierogies, 
  worst s\u0119kacz picture ever . 
  they looks like [ this ] ( http://www.wilno.name/images/wilno/kuchnia/imgp2602.jpg ), 
  is abortion considered here ? 
  not only in europe but in western europe : d, 
  stop recognising vatican as a country ? 
  or even worse - they may put import embargo for vatican : d, 
  what 's wrong with celebrating a work-free day ? 
  repost http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3284vv/swords_at_dawn_polish_prince_challenges_farage_to/, 
  has n't napoleon ( or louis xiii ) banned dueling couse he was losing most of his officers in duels instead of wars ? 
  ( i only heard here and there about it ), 
  would suck if the good one was the one who gets killed though eg . 
  when impaled on a line ( offensive-defensive move in fencing when you estabish right of way by straightening your arm so that when the opponent decieds to lunge he gets simply impaled if he does n't deal with the line in time ), 
  name ( bloodline `` po mieczu '' - from father 's side ) is what counts most, 
  well they could have a bout with sport sabre and a dabate afterwards , 
  fortress poland * cracow is marked couse it was the capital then, 
  it 's not just krak\u00f3w , it 's almost whole territory of polish kingdom, 
  but has n't dueling been banned since something like xviii or xix century ? 
   speedway but only in few towns also depends if popular for watching or doing if watching ski jumps would be also high for participating dancing if you consider it a sport , table tennis , general jogging or cycling , mayby sailing , skiing, 
  even cities ' names got translated eg . 
  i do n't get why russian expansion is under `` colonization '', 
  but but there 's no germany here anymore, 
  i wonder why austria also did n't get split,
