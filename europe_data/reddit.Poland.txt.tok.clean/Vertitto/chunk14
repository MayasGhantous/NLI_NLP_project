  for people wondering the song is [ dark eyes / \u041e\u0447\u0438 \u0447\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 / oczy czarne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tquy3fqvcyc ) , russian-gypsy song , original text written by ukrainian - jewhen hrebinka and music by russo-german - florian hermann, 
   is it promoting division and flame wars ? 
  have not notice  ( the countries included in the european union ) i do n't get this part , it 's r/europe , not r/europeanunion, 
  arrinera s.a. is issuing corporate bonds to acquire 5 mln z\u0142 ( ~ 1.24 mln eur , 1.32 mln usd ) from market with an aim to sell sport model in 2015, 
  and ? 
  kind of hilarious that there 's polish song ( [ `` tylko we lwowie '' from `` w\u0142\u00f3cz\u0119gi '' movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhc6zga4hrm ) ) in the background #giblw\u00f3w ; ), 
  ye some countries are more religious , but there 's no problems with being non religious . 
  i would even say it 's more frown upon when you are devoutly religious, 
  same here problems start when it gets to politics , as church gets butthurt claiming be oppressed, 
  wtf is that poster about ? 
  i love the interwar period style in both hearstyles and clothes, 
  having the black sea or mediterranean seas as options you picked baltic ? 
  really ? 
  what 's interesting about it ? 
  seems to be obvious that eu is founding majority of such project, 
  i guess it 's similar as poland - lower-mid of 1st world , but ego says we need to be at the top, 
  perhaps , it was plc so either way is cool ; ), 
  few battles ( couse people love to read about them , random order ) : - [ battle of klushino ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_klushino ) russia + sweden got rekt and as a bonus we captured kremlin ( day when russians expelled us from moscow is now russian national holiday [ unity day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unity_day_%28russia%29 ) ) - [ siege of vienna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ) saving yurop from ottomas - [ battle of warsaw ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_%281920%29 ) saving yurop from soviets - [ battle of kircholm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) swedes got rekt - [ battle of khotyn 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_khotyn_%281621%29 ) + [ battle of khotyn 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_khotyn_%281673%29 ) , again ottomans got rekt, 
  damn i ' v been looking for green towers yep , [ google view ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/katedra+wniebowzi%c4%99cia+naj%c5%9bwi%c4%99tszej+maryi+panny+w+zagrzebiu/@45.81316,15.978388,3a,75y,27.56h,93.75t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1sz69fmdjxnt3dk75ga9kdiw!2e0!3e5!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x312b512f1e7f6df9 ) seems to match the photo, 
   prague  within the yugoslavia states eee, 
   laser technology do you have mayby a source of that ? 
  cosue i ' v heard similar thing about poland, 
  + beating them also in volleyball and handball for combo, 
  taking lessons from best korea ? 
  around 10 is warm enough, 
  well fuck google then , they changed something recently, 
  i find some hijabs pretty cool - the colorful , ornamented ones that look like scarfs ( or mayby they are just scarfs , dunno i 'm just a man ) . 
  only thing that rustles my jimmies is when they are enforced / edit eg . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.molon.de/galleries/iran/shiraz/eram/images01/10%20young%20iranian%20girl.jpg ) ( such thing , or variation of this is also quite [ popular in poland ] ( http://img.likely.pl/photo/large/20120910/chustka-pod-szyje-likely-pl-e3994bde.jpeg ) , it 's not put on head unless it 's colder or small rain/snow though ), 
  long live the potato countries then ; ), 
  there 's lot of regional names general 3 that are widely recognised are imo : kartofel , ziemniak i pyra, 
  that 's cute , but nowhere near of polan level ( over 100 ) there was thread about it here , but i can not find it ; (, 
  they are hardly a thing in poland ( even considering other minorities ) - never heard of them here . 
  after googling i found that there 's only some little temple in some small town under warsaw . 
  then it will be `` witamy austri\u0119 '' or `` witamy reprezentacj\u0119 austrii '' ( = we welcome austrian representatives ) or `` witamy austriak\u00f3w '' ( = we welcome austrians ), 
  kind of important thing - in what person , gender , tense etc ? 
  ( there 's shit ton of ways to say it look at [ the table ] ( http://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/wita%c4%87 ) click on the click more `` poka\u017c '' button ) standard thing you say when you great someone alone you say [ `` witam '' ] ( http://pl.forvo.com/word/witam/#pl ) ( i welcome ) or [ `` witamy '' ] ( http://pl.forvo.com/word/witamy/#pl ) ( = we welcome ), 
  it was already posted , i remember the pew pew pew plane found it : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zbtgl/why_does_the_us_need_a_big_war_in_europe_russian/, 
  sounds cute, 
  dunno if you can even say we had winter this year ... 
  great initiative, 
  internet life hack : google < series name  online or torrent, 
  we got two sides : from over 30 in summer to -30 in winter , glorious continental climate ; ), 
  people there are also way more open so there 's also that ; ), 
  hmm usually ukraine gets compared to poland , nice to see different perspective, 
  around 24 is where it starts to be to hot for me , in poland alone we have days with 35, 
  you can get places with no winter , atheist , with less homogeneous community, 
  dunno if i could get used to a sunny , hot climate when i 'm dying each summer with temps getting over 24 ' c, 
  `` meanwhile , in ... '' is people greeting american soldiers , not some military training, 
  similar thing happen in poland a week or two ago - temperatures were up to even 15 ' c and just out of nowhere on weeked it started snowing heavily, 
  for sure, 
  false, 
  wrong sub, 
   creationism , the belief that a god -- not evolution -- shaped life on earth ( ... ) it 's false - not precise enough . 
   i know here in turkey that most girls would be disowned by their families for doing something like this . 
  my father himself even told my sisters that he will disown them if they ever get with a black man . 
  nothing like this would happen in poland . 
  most that would happen is grandparents would mayby have some objections ( like taking her to a side and ask if she could n't find some nice polish guy ) for a lil, 
  from the other side now even more money can get wasted couse various temples may get to be constructed, 
  the article makes one mistake - they are talking about young earth creationism ( earth is few thousand years old , species got created at once by god and humans walked with dinosaurs crap ) . 
  creationism alone just says that god feagure created the universe - all other things like big bang or evolution are just tools and are fully compatable . 
  i love this argument `` i certainly aint no monkey '' ( read with steorotypical redneck accent ), 
   as bad as it does today eee ? 
  pretty good then, 
  it 's it the us stuff that tours across eastern edge of eu ? 
  no , just use some more telling indicator eg . 
  number of people applying for army/reserve/paramilitary per x number of citizens . 
  just asking is pretty much pointless considering non of those people even expirienced war , do n't take their family into account , in most cases it 's just `` yeah i will fight couse i was taught that it 's the thing to do '' not even realising what that entails, 
  there 's a special sub for this --  / r/explainlikeimfive /, 
  is it based on some poll or participation in army/paramilitary ? 
  if it 's a poll then it 's completly bullshit - what one says will do in face of war and what actually is done are completly different things, 
  old towns are beautiful , but there are also `` soviet blocks farms '', 
  and now they want to be friends with best korea , so beloved korean leader may teach them how to talk with the dolphins, 
  i freaking love the style of white classic looking buildings with dark accents / edit : for other people liking the style here 's how polish parlament corridors look like [ 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/20081009_korytarz_sejm_rp.jpg/1280px-20081009_korytarz_sejm_rp.jpg ) or [ main hall ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/polskisejm007.jpg/800px-polskisejm007.jpg ) where most of the interviews take place, 
  when there 's lot of people from the same nation/language/culture group they tend to stick together and therefore they do n't need learn or are way slower at learning local lang and culture creating tensions, 
  remove women from premisses !, 
  men so oppressed , look at accountants - it 's a profession nearly entirely dominated by women !, 
  12 % of votes mayby among their own members ; p, 
  would be nice if you included who are `` we '' since you got eu/eu flair/comment, 
  - programmers-coders in various langs - doctors - physical workers i guess, 
  there 's also the panslavic one i forgot how it 's called, 
  we had esperanto , it did n't work , why should another one work ? 
  my swedish teacher had the same accent , which region is it ? 
  ( or is it `` general swedish '' ? ), 
  [ irish women sunbathing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fpuuf.jpg ) ------------------------------- [ pole on vacation ] ( http://kotlet.pl/content/images/typowy-polak-136940562332.jpg ) ( transl : `` gra\u017cyna ( female name ) clap your hands , we 've landed '' , context : poles made themselves known for clapping after plane lands , especially on transatlantic lines during communism , it became a meme ), 
  it 's absurd couse it puts race above everything as if there was a conspiracy of sorts . 
  who the f cares what race an author/proffestor is , in 99,9 % it 's completly irrevelant and they are making a problem of it . 
  they are going to britain and are surprised that history is taught from the british pov , like wtf ? 
  whose else pov it should be ? 
  dunno mayby there is some problem in britain , i do n't know how it looks like from personal expirience , but the vid sounds like complete bullshit for me . 
  it 's need to be euro-centric at its core since it 's the enviroment it works in . 
  i find the premiss of the video absurd, 
  i would love if in response hungary changed song to `` long live palestine '' song ; d, 
  and what if putin wants to lure them there and magically make them vanish ? 
  would be nice to provide us with translation, 
  number of ikea stores so relevant  the proposed flag is ugly as fuck, 
   eurovision either make it serious or just end it, 
  but it 's not how culture works . 
  it reflects people who live in the place . 
  it changes , mixes , evolves .
