  small thing , couse people always confuse the thing - polka ( dance/music ) is not a polish thing ; polish dance/music that derives from the name is polonaise and it looks/sounds like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqqld9u_jui ) or [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp0pmjdyuz4 ) ( different song ), 
  the logo looks like it was for forester not an army, 
  i would hope eu would not agree , i would love to visit iran someday and i do n't want foreign affairs to fuck that up, 
  it 's mentioned :  medical tourism globally is growing at 20 % per annum . 
  there is said to be growing competition in europe from countries such as lithuania and ** turkey ** , as well as further afield from india , thailand and malaysia . 
  oh yeah , rosetta especially had me cheering `` fuck yeah , we did this '' inside, 
  when making fun of ` muricans on sub name of which is forbidden to mention, 
  hated so much that even propaganda stats has to kneel ; p, 
  pew pew pew and research is done :d also it 's pretty funny that best russia got in the last 7 years 45 % . 
  attack on georgia , suspicion of shooting down plane with our officials and now ukraine , way to fuck things up had the survay had bigger time frame , i wonder if it was the highest it ever had in modern history, 
  also most of the things gets produced in poland ? 
  i sense sweden bribed polan, 
  only good side of this sanctions for poland is that exporters at least got forced to look into new markets, 
  [ context ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ) always needs to be posted in threads like this ; ) or more reallife turists ' struggle : plac trzech krzy\u017cy ( three crosses square in warsaw ), 
  afaik all countries are ready to drop the sanctions ... when russia gives back crimea/east to ukraine, 
  oh god , those scraches are so repelling reminds me bit of [ ratamahatta by sepultura ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsuyuvehby8 ) , but instead of going into metal , this one goes to rap/hiphop, 
  not even mentioned in my school . 
  non of my books had it mentiond more than eg . 
  `` ottoman empire did n't engage in x couse it was bussy dealing with internal problems '' . 
  there was little bit about yugo conflict and un involvement when it came to modern times dunno how it looks now though, 
   eeuu had to google wtf it was , please use acronyms from the lang you are writting in ; for other people : it 's spanish version of us . 
  why there ' r double letters there anyway ? 
  i was happy to learn something about the region considering we got nothing about it on history lessons, 
  i will be mad if it turns out i was able to see those and i missed it, 
  wow , did n't know you get to see them, 
  wider list for poland ( are names are adjectives ) : 1 . 
  lipowa 1684 ( lime tree street ) 8 . 
  brzozowa 1552 ( birch tree street ) 9 . 
  \u0141\u0105kowa 1508 ( meadow street ) 10 . 
  in poland there 's both luxurious and common ( from food to electronics ), 
  once again : it 's not list of things that taste bad , but list of things that sounds scarry/gory, 
  use search http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2wbyki/culinary_horrors_of_europe/, 
  horror , does n't mean it 's bad , just sounds scarry, 
  but the name of the country ( european part ) is actually holland in many languages , not a confusion of any kind . 
  it 's not precise name , but this is how it works . 
  in polish : - holandia - the country in europe , citizens are holendrzy ( plural ) , holender ( sing . 
  m. ) , holenderka ( sing , f. ) - niderlandy - coloquial 2nd name of holand and historical region - kr\u00f3lestwo niderland\u00f3w ( kingdom of the netherlands ) - country in europe + it 's overseas territories also fun fact : holender is also a light curse word in polish ; you say it when something bad happens, 
  but it 's / europe , not / us, 
  use search http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2z0aoi/poland_steels_for_battle_seeing_echoes_of_cold/, 
  dunno for lt , but there 's tone of russians visiting poland just to make big shopping as it 's cheaper or better quality here, 
  they can go on a weekend trip to poland or lithuania for shopping , which is nice, 
  that 's not chess , that 's checkers on the topic , i had chess classes in my elementary school ( as obligatory class ) taught by some top class polish chess player ( i do n't remember his name ) . 
  i had it 2x45min in week from first to third grade iirc . 
  it was pretty cool . 
  it was pretty serious - we had chess notation ( we had to write down the moves in a specific way ) , we had lot of `` given this set , you have to win in max 8moves '' type of tasks and standard rounds ofc . 
  we were even given homework . 
  i liked those . 
  it was not a standard thing for schools though, 
  is it still widly used ? 
  in polish it 's just an option , but it 's rarely used in day-to-day speach, 
  usually becouse they lack life expirience or knowledge about the world . 
  they just go for the against everything , edgy guy . 
  from my experience a standard korwin voter is person that just got into voting age , mayby early studying age who 's main information source is kwejk or wykop, 
   latvia - six toes context ? 
  aside from geography only some parts from the medival/northern wars period when poland fought vs sweden and russia over the territory of today 's latvia and estonia . 
  i could n't eg . 
  name any modern known people from those countries, 
  are you able to think anything else for the other two ? 
  the tank reminds me my firend 's christmas revelation about men : `` they do not mature , they just grow '' ; story : she was with her father ( ~ 60y ) in mall looking for presents for her mother . 
  passing next to some toy shop her father noticed a tank , just like the one in the video and said : `` ooo i could have such tank '' , momentarily he followed that up with : `` ooo !, 
  and you can even drive the thing ! '', 
  yea and dozen of other songs , 
   you 've learned too much about it that even your political views reflect those that the uk teaches . 
  lol , it 's one of the dumbest things i ' v read is some time  most do n't want to admit that this subreddit does not represent accurately the views of most europeans . 
  did anyone ever claimed it did ? 
  it 's just random bunch of redditiors interested in some way or another in europen region, 
  he 's a politician , neutral is highest he can get when half of the society does n't like him, 
  yey another song thread ------------------------------------------- few songs thate are close to every pole 's heart : - [ marek grechuta - dni ktorych nie znamy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og6peolakm8 ) - [ mieczys\u0142aw fogg - ostatnia niedziela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f7juh9q-to ) - probably most known song from the inter war period ( there 's ton of beautiful songs from this time - another one [ ` ju\u017c nigdy !

  in general songs that can appear on this list are sung during volleyball matches eg [ perfect 's ko\u0142ysanka dla nieznajomej ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuj-e8vjmwm ), 
  it 's rather neutral-negative . 
  talks a lot , does nothing type of guy . 
  he proposed lots of good changes , but opposite got to be legislated ( some due to the crysis ) , he also switched to eu possition in a `` fuck this , i 'm going to brussels '' fashion . 
  really ? http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2z52tc/amazing_sign_language_guy_from_swedish_national/, 
  dashcams are not popular in poland, 
  just as the [ song goes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp2x5wuhjhm ) :  i will go to the girl , i will go the one , i will ask her . 
  if she answers - `` i do n't love you '' , then uhlans are recruting , soldiers are marching , i will just sign up '' so romantic nee i do n't really know, 
  dunno , mayby one was capital and 2nd was seat of government, 
  it 's a typo , in the same paragraph it says it 's from latin terra tuber good catch though ; ), 
  ziemne ( = ground/earth adj ) not zimne ( = cold ) : ), 
  http://sjp.pl/gajdy only this and some village pops up, 
  never heard of this one , it does n't even pop up in google ... 
  in polish you can also say kartofel or in some regions pyra / edit : thanks to / u/roxven89 more names for potato : ba\u0142aban , bulba , gajda , gajdak , grul , harcak , jab\u0142ko , knul , p\u0105tak , ziemne jab\u0142ko . 
  in the source posted it says one dictionaty has ~ 150 names for potato ( both regional and types ) . 
  the names that are widely used and understood are the 3 : ziemniak/kartofel ( most popular ) , pyra ( from pozna\u0144 region ), 
  found it on google , i 'm pretty sure it was already posted there few times ( it 's a wikipedia map ) . 
  you can post it there if you want for karma , 
  fixed, 
  or nice , small consonant cluster in lipsk, 
  when it comes to poland some of those cities got to be part of either austro-hungarian empire or prussia after partitions, 
  interwar period [ map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/europe_in_1923.jpg ) / edit : it 's funny how seeing the title the first thought is `` ro-pl border ? 
  wtf ? '', 
  lang in this vid also scares me - he uses polish words but with `` american trying to speak polish '' accent , sounds very robotic, 
  are you kidding me ? 
  being able to be close with best korea is an honour, 
  joining the cool kids club i see, 
  no problem , local attitudes are rather friendly - once after some excercises some us choppers had to land outside some village couse of the weather or something and locals invited them for dinner and took photos [ i ' v found some aarticle about that event ] ( http://www.news.com.au/world/lost-us-army-helicopters-drop-in-on-unsuspecting-polish-town-of-gruta-for-tourist-maps/story-fndir2ev-1227054741154 ), 
   `` na pole '' is n't it only krak\u00f3w region thing ? 
  i never heard it in any other part of poland, 
  in polish tea is also called czaj ( like in other slavic countries , but it 's usually refered to very strong tea ) , but it 's rarely used,
