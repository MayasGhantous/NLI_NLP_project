  is n't it the other way around - bogactwo comes from b\u00f3g, 
  does n't it sound pretty much same as czechy ? 
  such abomination , remove as of nau, 
  `` oh , there 's some text , let 's read it !, 
  hurray !, 
  '' - type of reason, 
   poland has really only one challenge would be cool if it was only one ; ), 
  previous one was way better made oh god , again i ' v started reading yt comments ... 
  people should be getting banned for shameless reposting http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=poland%27s+geographic+challenge&amp;restrict_sr=on, 
  does anyone actually call it d\u00f6ner ? 
  it 's just kebab, 
  once you get entry to one eu member you can go to all of them, 
  empire of nato , it sounds hilarious ; ), 
  our main royal castles - in krak\u00f3w and warsaw are rather underwhelming from outside ; (, 
  f )  there was a western betrayal but it certainly was n't to poland . 
   we 're full of them who are `` we '' . 
  flair up or just edit in where are you from, 
  such attention grab title, 
  ah , indeed . 
  hymn is always outside the song box in my head, 
  by main media church is rather often critisised for being slow with change or dumb arguments . 
  premarital sex or anticonception is not any kind of tabu aside from some very close to church people . 
  in case of anti-gay or abortion is more complicated - eg . 
  gays screwd their image with obnoxious parades . 
  things as various religious holidays are covered in news couse almost whole country is polish catholic with some orthodox in eastern parts of poland ( those are also covered ) tl ; dr : main media are rather liberal , church is presented often in `` and they still have problem with something ... '' tone . 
  anti-science , anti-evolution or new-earth creationism is not a thing if that 's what you are asking, 
  still , it 's expensive and produces waste , which we want to avoid as much as possible . 
  nuclear power is a bit no-no today , if invest in something it would be renewable, 
  i still remember most of the lyrics after i had them on my music lessons in primary school - [ o m\u00f3j rozmarynie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp2x5wuhjhm ) ( `` oh my rosemary '' ; my fav ) - [ piechota , ta szara piechota ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y3oqzz8sx8 ) ( `` infantry , that grey infantry '' ) - [ rozszumia\u0142y si\u0119 wierzby p\u0142acz\u0105ce ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6cops_sa_e ) ( `` weeping willow started to sough '' ) - [ hej , hej , u\u0142ani ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unfm3uisgqw ) ( `` hej , hej uhlans !

  polan so equal ; ), 
  being anti-abortion does n't have to have anything to do with religion, 
  i love how my high school did it - it was `` religion '' , but we were encouraged by the teacher to study for important courses ( people were pretty ambitious so they actualy did math/biology/physics / english/chemistry or w/e else they planed to take on matura exams instead of jerking of ) , only for some holidays we did some singing or stuff like that, 
  eee i guess that 's what you pictured yourself ... 
   because everyone tries to hide the fact that there have been huge divisions in the ukrainian society lol where did you get that ? 
  why ? 
  use search it was posted here few times already,

  [ og\u00f3rek-hime ] ( http://i.imgur.com/72piw41.jpg ) ftw context : it 's magda og\u00f3rek , she was starting for president in the past elections ( ended up 5th with 2,4 % ) , these meme it 's what 's left of her , for more look up / magdachanhime on facebook ( had to repost couse bot delated my previous comment for having fb link ), 
  you are to late to the party https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4hrh6s/romania_on_europe/, 
  well , it 's a folk dress - they all look similar, 
  the thing is they are not similar to either of those , while media put a trump sticker due to refugee handling, 
   not really , they go far beyond what sanders wants . 
  which exactly proves my point , which is that the right wing parties do n't really have much in common with trump, 
  expected [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6e/09/68/6e0968f9c1edffad3044f5e30311d1f0.jpg ), 
  i love how calling `` trumpism over europe '' american media seem toforget to mention that those `` trump-like , right wing european parties '' are usually more similar to sanders in their social policies . 
  / edit : to clear thing out : the right wing parties got nearly nothing in common with trump aside from not being found of how the refugge crisis is handeled and media put a sticker as if they were somehow european versions of trump, 
  popped also in some other maps - eurovision : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1c7gdoafy0, 
  as for ukraine word `` nezalezhnya '' means independent, 
   to croatia mayby `` wide '' as it 's stretched along the coast ? 
  please explain the weird ones like poland , sweden , czech , croatia or romania, 
  that 's what i 'm talking about - it 's not cyprus investing, 
  that would be cruel, 
  was it in belarusian , russian or english ? 
  wtf about slovenia ? 
  also cyprus investing in russia , how cute , 
   religion does n't effect ethnicity . 
  cry more croats , bosniaks and serbs : ^ ), 
  yea but reason good enough to circlejerk about on reddit, 
  why english search though ? 
  he confused czech and austria : ) most of them are super random . 
  nope , salty feels, 
  that 's not what 's surprising - it 's surprising that someone was willing to pay for eurovision votes, 
  what was the phrase you used ? 
  it looks as if sometimes you used different phrases, 
  strong summer winds ( the ones that destroy forests and rip roofs off ) are more common . 
  tornados ( the tube coming down and fucking thing up ) do n't happen often . 
  [ example for yt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of4fgk-qr8a ) ( there 's only few of those on yt ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgks6fyzswa ) 's an effect of tornado from 2012 . wow it was even reported by [ chinese cctv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abhrilx2pnk ), 
  it has been for around 8 years already, 
  done random ones and it 's correct, 
  context : main one : unesco world heritage site [ wieliczka salt mine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wieliczka_salt_mine ), 
  serbia is part of eu ? 
  touchdowns are pretty rare, 
   song apsurdistand < 3, 
  becouse they are further away , 
  if internet ones count then [ aszdziennik ] ( http://aszdziennik.pl/ ) and [ faktoid ] ( http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/faktoid/0,0.html ) . 
  both are a caricature of tabloids , hyperbolising news to absurd hights and posting stuff so dumb it 's hilarious, 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victory_in_europe_day ) says you lie - no country has/had it on [ 3rd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_3#holidays_and_observances ) , but on 5th , 8th or 9th, 
  similar in polish - \u015awi\u0119to pracy - holiday of labour ( which itself sounds absurd ), 
  new meta - rename yourself to kurdistan , join and change name back !, 
  it 's a more private thing though, 
  nowadays it 's not seen as `` worker 's day '' , but part of long may holiday ( 3rd is also free day in poland ) , where you spend time with family and friends, 
  not really any more . 
  nowdays it 's part of long may holiday ( we also got 3rd may free as it 's constitution day ) . 
  noone put attention to the `` worker 's day '' any more - they could as well change it to `` barbecue day '' which would better describe it, 
  you mean / r/historywhatif / r/askhistorians is not for `` what would have happened '' threads, 
  yea it 's fun to speculate , but it would be nice to at least have a somwhat firm starting point, 
  keep in mind winning the war dos n't have to mean the winner is in a good shape afterwards, 
  i hate this type of questions couse there 's shit ton of `` ifs '' included , especially while the starting point is ambiguous as `` x wins the war '', 
  dunno , but germany would then handle another war pretty damn fast vs [ soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ), 
   czech and slovak for example . 
  russian , belarussian and ukranian . 
  not entirely . 
  more comes from people actually learning both languages .
