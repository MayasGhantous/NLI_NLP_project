  when one has no exposure to other the level of mutual intelligible falls pretty drastically ( yes it 's still understandable after hand gestures and thesaurus play , but not mutualy intelligible any more ), 
  is the egg painting tradition is till a thing in your countries ? 
  here it 's dying out , very few families still do that and if they do it 's usually some simple designs, 
  it 's ok . 
  i got used to seeing it next to polish one on flag posts, 
  why denmark specifically ? 
  this is imo the scarriest part about pis rule ( so far ), 
  gender segregation ? 
  not sex one ? 
  how liberal of them to recognise that sexes can have different genders , 
  that movie is briliant, 
  poland is most often shown as a victim , poor , default sidekick/narrator . 
  rarely shown as dumb tbh, 
  / cough / human traffiking / cough /, 
  japanese usually know that he was polish though, 
   i think it 's gon na be in your post so you 're probably right yep  found the [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4d1rlc/what_are_some_of_your_favourite_surnames_from/d1n7md1 ), 
  what was the search phrase ? 
  the variance in gramatics of the answers is weird - or is it only due to nippon lanuage ? 
  it 's imported from us dumb polack i guess, 
  belarusian, 
   it would serve as a wakeup call for the eu headquarters in brussels referendum alone is not enough ? 
   serbia is winning great name , 
  you are way overthinking it . 
  they guy you are accusing is actually helping to prevent what you say by giving context to attention grabbing title, 
   making it seem like it was just an excuse to steal churches . 
  what the hell ? 
  seems like overblown article, 
  that 's really dumb, 
  depends more on proposed design than who proposes it tbh , but i 'm quite ok with the one we got atm as for moldovian flag i would agree - it would be nice if you changed ( or just join back to romania alltogether ), 
   man , lom\u017ca has to be the ugliest polish city . 
  it 's certainly boring ; medicore but far from being ugly, 
  my hometown : \u0141om\u017ca ( eastern poland ) - [ promo wideo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1l-rgxnpeu ) - [ happy \u0141om\u017ca ( pharrell williams - happy ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glsx8zw1xws ) city i currently live in : gdynia , 3city ( 3city/3miasto/tricity / tr\u00f3jmiasto : gda\u0144sk , sopot and gdynia + smaller towns like rumia , reda or pruszcz gda\u0144ski , a big aglomeration northen poland , works pretty much like one big city ) : - [ promo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n-lswtyjja ) - [ drone vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2erpvzfdgik ) - [ 3city vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntvkj8koawk ) - [ 3city 4k ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3prx9hsry ), 
  i ' v also played this in poland , but the phrase was different ( do n't remember what exactly ), 
  usually it 's just drinking , mayby `` i ' v never ... '' , alko-janga , alko roulette , alko-mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht ( chi\u0144czyk in polish ) or any board game turned into alko game, 
  i guess at some point corruption gets so bad that it 's getting hard to describe the economy as market economy . 
  extracts from wiki :  tunisia is an export-oriented country in the process of liberalizing and privatizing an economy that , while averaging 5 % gdp growth since the early 1990s , has suffered from corruption benefiting politically connected elites  tunisia is in the process of economic reform and liberalization after decades of heavy state direction and participation in the economy . 
  yea , but ukraine has problems of badly done privatisation - mainly oligarchs . 
  it 's pretty hard to fix that, 
   i strongly recommend his shock therapy to ukraine . 
  is n't it too late for that ? 
  he also advised various tunesian/egyptian politicians on how to switch to market economy & democracy after the arab spring, 
  [ yeah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjhjnevone ), 
  eurovision changed `` a bit '' since abba ; ), 
  the voting obviously, 
  still got good sabreur - go go [ tibi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x4uxbyv2xi ) !, 
  comparing eurovision to olympics is just crazy, 
  swedes and australians do, 
  apf , i just skimmed the text seeing `` country subredits , only language '' fixed, 
  we simply got two : - / r/poland for english - works mostly as '' / askpoland '' - news , foreigners asking various questions regrding travel , work , living , language or history , some fluffy videos from time to time - / r/polska for polish - mainly news , recent events and fluff like drone videos as long as it 's somehow related to poland it 's ok i guess, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_parties_in_poland#parliamentary_parties non is labeled as `` far-right '' quick google and it 's similar for other countries as well, 
  it 's pretty standard on / mapporn unfortunately , it 's not a highest quality sub, 
  also legend should be ** one the map ** , also source ? 
  some explaination what counts as `` far right '' ? 
  what far right party is in polish parliament ? 
  like catholic church ? 
  ( in poland ) ; ), 
  no idea about dzia\u0142ki , but block cellars ? 
  i do n't remember when was the last time i ' v heard someone had his cellar broken into, 
  krak\u00f3w is cool and all , but damn , # 7 of the world ? 
  nope , but many people are stil very warry - forewarned is forearmed . 
  does n't matter that last time you heard anyone got robbed was 10 years ago - it 's still worth to get extra super locks , couse you never know, 
  these two and `` the pianist '' are the most known ones . 
  cool , but wrong uprising, 
  personal endeavours of artist got impact on your willingness to watch their work ? 
   how do people living there avoid depression you do n't . 
  you embrace it , 
  while towns like suwa\u0142ki , \u0141om\u017ca or bia\u0142ystok are nice , some other small towns look like shit, 
  the pot calling the kettle black situation . 
  you ca n't believe that latvian/ukrainian nationalists adhere to nazis , while on your backyard you got nationalists praising soviet union and communism, 
  read the plot synopsis on wiki and watch the movie with that in mind . 
  the ghetto one is the small one , while the warsaw uprising is the one where whole city is in ruins, 
  it 's shown briefly as szpilman watches it from the window, 
  keep in mind that there are two uprisings shown in pianist, 
  also small thing , couse foreigners often confuse the two - there were ** two uprisings ** in warsaw during the ww2 - first the one in jewish ghetto ( confined to the ghetto , the one portrayed in [ uprising ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250798/ ) ) - [ 2nd one a year later ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising ) ( covering the whole city , portrayed in [ warsaw 44 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2emplyypt_i ) ) ; [ this tradition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejd2rsxoqsi ) is a memorial to the 2nd one / edit : educational bonus : [ warsaw rising portal ] ( http://warsawrising.eu/ ) ( switch language at the bottom right ) - interactive presentation covering warsaw history before , during and after ww2 . 
  lot of archival photos , materials or stats, 
  why not ? 
  it 's often that each parish goes by itself and they converge as they get closer . 
  as for festival part of the question - i got no idea , it 's not my thing, 
  it varies - some are religious , but i guess most use it as an opportunity to have a trip with larger community where you can meet new people, 
  some info about [ the monastery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasna_g%c3%b3ra_monastery ), 
  examples ? 
  i do n't think i ' v seen anything like that, 
  another thing do you know or heard about anyone voting at eurovision ? 
  i did n't call him retard , but named his statement as one worthy of a retard . 
  there 's a difference, 
   there were no plans to hunt bisons that i know of . 
  there were few time couse their population went to big . 
  to create another problematic exclave of course, 
  3rd time the charm ? 
  1 ) prussia - balts 2 ) prussia - germans 3 ) prussia - slavs ? 
   why not reinstate the nation of prussia this has no sense, 
  you forgot that all germans from kaliningrad were either expelled or killed ... 
  the main beat is super catchy, 
  wiki :  c ) the participation of australia was intended as a one-off event to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the contest unless they won in 2015 in which case they would have been allowed to defend their crown in 2016 .
