  boobs kind of worked - we got 5th place by popular votes , jury grinded us down though [ results ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iqcault1uygxm4dmy5i2pa1pgyocdaqj4ebyxunmzh0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true ) [ the boobs song in question ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ) ; and 2 other songs from the project : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trwo1xbv6e ) and [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvkzyul7ubq ) ( this one made the thing popular ),

  maybe , if you have an extremly bipolar view on feelings . 
  bring back the [ intervision song contest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intervision_song_contest ) !, 
  judging from viewer hits and comments on this year entries polan may actually have a decent shot this year, 
  discontent = / = hatered, 
   that makes you blind with hatred towards us , russians what ? 
   party names a country that has imperialistic politics , nuke arsenal , huge army , long history of war with the party and has been agressive in recent years invading bordering countries vs  party names countries that do n't fully align with his political likings both argumentation is totally on the same level, 
   i clearly see the rise of nationalism , racism etc. 
  amongst my friends and colleagues . 
  yes , but it 's nowhere near `` existential threat '' to anything though , which is what makes him sound like a retard, 
  someone just went full retard, 
  some trivia - surprisingly overall we got pretty good opinion on those enemies in the end as both ottoman empire and qajar persia ( turkey and iran ) were the only countries who refused to accept the partitions of poland . 
  ottoman empire is said to have reserved a place in its diplomatic corps for an ambassador of lehistan ( poland ), 
   it 's the poles doing the polandballs right ? 
  nope it 's just a name , everyone can makes them about any country . 
  poland is just a `` character '' that started the whole thing, 
  to cheer you up even more : [ 1 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dojcsot.png ) ; [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xqopwur.png ) ; [ 3 ] ( http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/ajagw80_700b.jpg ) ( 3 is personal fav ) ; ), 
  fixed, 
  i just love finnish accent, 
   errors & consistency as we are with it - if poland is included in the `` eastern european '' vid thumbail it should also be included in the `` central european '' one ( just like czech , slovakia , hungary ) or just make a thumbail with only countries flags of which are being described also decide whether to use borders with flags ( like central and eastern has ) or flag poles ( nordics ) or a general location on the map ( baltics ) . 
  i would be ok if each was different , but then you made central and eastern in the same style ;p  beautiful capital eeee you would found many people in poland who would not agree ; ), 
  all my polish/history teachers were always correcting when people used eg . 
  `` ruski '' instead of `` rosyjski '' . 
  i grew the habbit myself :p, 
  i guess he just got confused with his own division of the continent or just does n't care for perfect consistency ; ) most people wo n't even notice that it 's warsaw 's old town there anyway, 
   poland is included in the ~ ~ central european ~ ~ flags video . 
  baltic *, 
  why the hell he puts photo of warsaw when poland is not included in the vid, 
  to overrustle belarusians and ukrainians even more , 
  [ this internet fenomenom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uccmdmonu66_1hwi5-meiqgw ), 
  the great and totally relevant republic of lusitania , ** definitly not spain , proud brazilian oversees colony ** , land of the portuguese , explorers of the seas , producers of cork and wine , and the true western europeans fixed, 
  it would be really dumb when not being a monarchy . 
  poland was the crown in the commonwealth as it was the state that was a legit kingdom ( lithuania was ** merely ** a grand dutchy ) . 
   i find it being kinda awkward as most of languages made a shift rus ' -  ruthenia -  russia , so many people just think of belarus as of white russia rather than ruthenia of rus ' . 
  except polan !, 
  polan has it right !, 
  honestly i ' v got no idea - i got really limited knowladge of polish cinematography ( just an averege joe ) . 
  remember that it was during communism so it 's was not private endeavour , but a thing funded from ministry of culture . 
  it is however quite remarkable that krzy\u017cacy got super big funding . 
  at least it payed off :  the film attracted to cinema masses of viewers and remains one of the most attended films in polish history : it sold 2 million tickets within several months , [ 3 ] 14 million after four years and as of 1987 , it had some 32,315,695 admissions . 
  it was also exported to forty-six foreign countries , [ 4 ] and sold 29.6 million tickets in the soviet union [ 5 ] and 2,650,700 in the czechoslovak socialist republic . 
  [ 6 ] it was a polish submission to the 33rd academy awards . 
   it was released on 15 july 1960 , the 550th anniversary of the battle of grunwald . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knights_of_the_teutonic_order_%28film%29 ) mayby someone will come and say something of value later, 
  on top , you get your pizza served and you can put on it as an additional thing, 
  [ like this ] ( https://translate.google.pl/?hl=pl#pl/en/czechia ) ( the polish one ), 
  just some random gimmick though , not a popular thing, 
  some : - [ krzy\u017cacy ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054004/ ) ( 1960 ) ( [ americanized trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgktfbrcsm0 ) )  in the 15th century the polish-lithuanian commonwealth is facing a hard struggle against the neighboring teutonic order.frequent clashes between the two powers finally culminate in 1410 with the battle of grunwald .

  - [ colonel wo\u0142odyjowski ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064785/ ) ( 1969 ) ( [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ozstter5h4 ) ) ( if you watch volleball matches - this is the song polish fans song at each match [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxvl-i8pyva ) )  in 1668 polish colonel michael wolodyjowski , who recently retired to a monastery , is recalled to active duty and takes charge of poland 's eastern frontier defenses against invading tatar hordes and ottoman armies .

  ( it 's a wiki highlight of the book the movie is basing on ) - [ leper ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075348/ ) ( 1976 ; not really a straight historic one , but a xix costume melodrama with great music )  a simple governess and a wealthy aristocrat fall madly in love with each other . 
  however , his family are prejudiced towards her and have other plans for him . 
  some songs from it : [ precz z moich oczu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdezrdmjzxo ) or [ waltz by wojciech killar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdu3o4zlozo ) - [ nights and days ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073460/ ) ( 1975 ; same as previous - melodrama , but great music )  an epic saga of the niechcic family , told from a woman 's perspective .

  also [ waltz by wojciech kilar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haokgwswd2q ) - [ pan tadeusz ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170351/ ) ( 1999 ) ( [ americanized trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrdn2moqom ) )  in the early 1810s , poles , part of russia 's client state of lithuania , think independence will come if they join forces with napoleon when he invades russia .

  there are hopes of a reconciliation through a marriage of pan tadeusz , a soplica , whose father , the murderer , is in hiding somewhere , and zosia , a teen-aged girl , a horeszko who lives in the household of pan 's uncle . 
  other cross-currents - of love , family , politics , village traditions , land reform , and what it means to be polish - give the film texture . 
  it 's an exile 's story . 
  - [ battle of warsaw 1920 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1783244/ ) ( 2011 , in 3d , i do n't recommand ) ( [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dstyagotwfm ) )  the first polish 3d feature film !,

  / edit : added trailers ; the americanised trailers are for lols ( the footage is from the movies ) ; added some songs couse they are great ; i guess that 's enough for one post, 
  / r/polska ( polish speaking one ) - i do n't use it that much , hard to say anything / r/poland - it 's basically foreigners asking about poland - language , surnames , travel or explanations of news . 
  i do n't like that the sub does n't have any skin , even copying the one from / r/polska would be ok not to look like some abandoned default sub, 
  that depends where are you from if from central/eastern/northen europen then it 's midly spicy , if you are from latin america or asia then it 's flavourless, 
  that comparison was totally missed, 
  what 's sadder ( for ukraine ) is that we had the same gdp as ukraine not so long ago [ pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/gdp_ppp_poland.svg/2000px-gdp_ppp_poland.svg.png ), 
  and the thread surely got reported for cultural offence, 
  one thing i heard from foreigners - they are surprised that we always got souce for pizza ( most popular are tomato/ketchup or garlic souces ) so i guess that counts as `` our regional pizza '' . 
  also contrary to traditional italian pizza pizzas in poland usually got much thicker base and often it is n't very crunchy ( but i think that 's the case everywhere outside italy ) as for topping i got no idea which one would be a typically polish or mayby polish spin on pizza - street food [ zapiekanka ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7gls1bufri8/vdkrsfdd15i/aaaaaaaajjy/a39rcq8njdw/s1600/zapiekanki%2b14.jpg ) ( typically : baguette , mushrooms , cheese + ketchup ), 
  it 's a bit weird couse wiki says polish h is / x / , which seems not to be the case . 
  i remember that long time ago there was a difference between `` ch '' and `` h '' in polish , but now it 's the same thing, 
  hmm i may be doing it wrong - on wiki polish h is / x / , but it 's exactly the same as h in history or hammer ( which is / h / ) or chark\u00f3w for that matter, 
  hmm what 's the difference between / h / and / x / ? 
  ( example in english or polish please ) they seem to be exactly the same for me / edit : question for somone knowledgeable on the matter - polish ch/h ( modern ofc ) is / h / ( like i think ) or / x / as it 's written on [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_alphabet#letters ) ? 
  couse bohemia is just one of the regions, 
  source ? 
  at least they would start to pronounce it correctly, 
  i 'm happy they still want to use glorious polish `` cz '' instead of \u010d or english `` ch '' ( and polish ch instead of h ) ; ), 
  couse they picked such picture - there are turist towns on most pictures and some got a standard down the road actual village, 
  we also got those ; ) the `` problem '' is that kr\u00f3l implies that it 's a male gramatically and `` kr\u00f3lowa '' is just female version of that world - which makes the impression that female on the throne would be `` kr\u00f3lowa '' which is not the case . 
  the missconception is further carried by every day use of the word eg . 
  in insect word,
