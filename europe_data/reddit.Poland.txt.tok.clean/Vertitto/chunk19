  the language pick actualy works - i thought she was somenoble that was captured/given to the ottomans , but wiki says she was a daughter of some small orthodox priest ( even if noble , not the kind i imagined ) . 
  ukrainian or russian ( that phrase may be the same in both ) or rusyn ( however it 's called in english , predecesor to ukrainian , russian and belarusian if they went for accuracy ), 
  wow you are really into that ~ ~ as for the scene - it 's pretty weird for them to pick russian - polish , latin or even german would be much more realistic picks imo ~ ~, 
  seeing the title i expected a picture from today 's anti illegal immigrants march, 
  i would say in general the nation is still pro eu , but not among the top proeu nations it used to be as of may 2015 it was 53 % possitive ( -8 pp compared to 2014 ) , 38 % neutral ( +6 ) and just 7 % negative ( +1 ) [ eurobarometer ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_first_en.pdf ), 
  in what way ? 
  i ' v only watched few episodes while in home, 
  eurozone and others would be one way going about it, 
  make sure to also look up [ crashcurse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse/playlists ) history vids - they go about it in a very cool way - one set of vids from a nation standpoint and 2nd from global perspective of some problems like civilisation , war , climate , energy , resources etc, 
  we got similar thing in polish : - kr\u00f3l ( king ) - the rulling one , kind of like `` an administrative '' title - kr\u00f3lowa ( queen ) - simply wife of the king - pretty much no power a female could be a king though - we had 2 female kings : [ jadwiga andegawe\u0144ska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jadwiga_of_poland ) and [ anna jagiellonka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_jagiellon ), 
  i dunno if they know that, 
  pis is eurosceptic in a sense that eu is fine , but further integration is not, 
  but then again all the grandmas who did expirience the era are worst offenders of queueing, 
   by my eastern european standards eee those are pretty high, 
  i love this kind of series, 
  couse [ polan is baltic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgmhop_i9lw ) now, 
  that one wins, 
  in polish it 's said literally : xyz `` ma\u0142pa '' gmail.com, 
   but they are not included in the top 25 safest countries . 
  depends on what list though . 
   we had communism here which in the end meant our countries were , , super safe , , comparing to rest of the world , because of police everywhere and so on . 
  transformation was n't even close to `` super safe '' , also before that nature of our police was n't so cool either, 
  pretty sad for italy to be comparing itself to lativia : ), 
  not only poland same goes for all countries from old block + yugos who suffer from the same problem . 
  most of the wider world still sees region from estonia up to even croatia , serbia and bulgaria as a unified ugly , grey commieblock jungle with nothing to see . 
  we do n't have so bad in fact compared to eg . 
  romania , belarus or ukraine, 
  ah the ugly , grey commieblock polan also nice picture [ warsaw 's skyline at sunset ] ( https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1622/26277641395_0c984956c8_o.jpg ), 
  that depends on the nature of the crimes . 
  it can also go the other way around . 
  ( i 'm type of guy who prefer to have thing like that shown separetly instead of a aggregated index value alone ), 
  still how can a country with so high homicide rate be even considered for `` top 20 '' type list . 
  ( high homicide rate in comparison to the top countires ofc , not general ; ) ) perception is very missleading , nearly pointless , it has more of a fluff value or a catalyst for the raw data . 
  there 's so much really dumb questions on reddit that it 's often hard to say if it 's a troll or just an insult . 
  lot of people genuinely get carried away media headlines, 
  just look at [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:homicide_rate_per_100_000_population,_average_per_year,_2005-2007_and_2008-2010.png ) for some perspective or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ), 
  or the one from / askreddit ; [ is it relatively safe to travel europe solo right now for a post-grad eurotrip ?

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/4dy10d/is_it_relatively_safe_to_travel_europe_solo_right/ ) lol, 
  how did belgium got t be so high ? 
  quick look at eurostat and they do n't look so hot . 
  they count emigration to the safety & security and it 's mostly based on survays ; ) [ methodology ] ( http://media.prosperity.com/2013/pdf/publications/methodology_2013_finalweb.pdf ), 
   except for russian girls i ' v heared it 's the other way around - girls want chinese as they are seen seen as a family guy that does n't drink , does n't beat and works making a good pick ( behind ural regions ), 
  orthodox/byzantine empire continuators, 
  and word of tanks ( and the 2nd tank game ),

  [ `` the next 100 years '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_next_100_years ) by george friedman ( the stratfor guy ), 
   but dont make it a comedy series i do n't think they could make a serious series work, 
  i doubt the figure on the picure is a noble - he does n't have a zupan . 
  looks like sunday dressed peasant to me , but then the sabre and `` funny hat '' does n't add up, 
  that sounds really sad i would love to see it though especailly if it was a comedy, 
  juding from the picures it 's something around xvii ( they got smallswords instead of rapiers ) and in clothes section `` long skirts '' which would point more towards [ such picture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/norblin_-_avocat_polonais.jpg ), 
   russia historically was n't seen as being properly european until very recently , are you joking ? 
  it 's actually reverse - it was always european and just recently stoped being considered so couse of eu = europe way of thinking, 
   much like russia ... it is europe, 
  \u017cupan + kontusz i guess ( use google for pictures ), 
  :3 hey why do others got noble/soldier/merchant pictures and poland got some church-day peasant ? 
  ;( also how did pole got to be the bear not russian ? 
  my fav is the one from biedronka with hazelnuts in red packaging and a `` window '' . 
  i do n't remember what brand it was and if it 's polish though ( wedel is also not polish anymore per se , but whatever ), 
   what is the best chocolate in your country ? 
  i would say anything by [ e.wedel ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=e.wedel&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewirq5vriv_lahxmbswkhwxhd18q_auibygb&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=915#tbm=isch&amp;q=wedel+czekolada ) for an averege good chocolate / edit : if waffles count then [ prince polo classic ] ( http://imworld.aufeminin.com/expertclub/20150209/275375_origin.jpg ) wins, 
  waaay to sweet, 
   and ukraine at the very top no chance , at best they are making their way into possitive . 
  also this poll is very doubtful - no source , no nothing, 
  couse of partying handsome men/pretty women , wine , culture , warm sea etc. 
  same will go for eg . 
  spanish , portugese or brazilians, 
  what do you mean ? 
  only two got net negative , + 3 around 50 % ... 
  from forums asking about that general answer is that chinese think we hate them couse we always sided with japan, 
  nope it 's how you look at this kid of stats . 
  if you make a poll without the `` indifferent '' part those people go into possitive . 
  the romanian poll is great example of that, 
  `` you have been fed propaganda , historical revisionism ... '' followed up , by `` russia - country where future is more certain than the past '', 
  bu\u0142gar / rumun/cygan are/were ( much less nowdays ) variation of the same slur, 
  if you ask about the root of the steorotype then bulgaria has been lumped into the `` general '' balcan region , which was ( and is ) poor , underdeveloped and relatively dangerous + they got lot of roma, 
   and make fun of their language that is what pushed them so far up , 
   all the bulgarian people i know are super nice that 's not what the poll is about, 
   squatting this one is not polish though, 
   look , poland , that 's how it 's done !, 
  we like ( almost ) everybody !, 
  different poll structure though , 
  try to make the demographics `` right '' again by subsidising families ( 500pln for each 2nd and next child per month until it hits 18 ) . 
  but that ofc is not enough even if people start having more children couse those kids need to find a job and not emigrate later on . 
  since the money will be running out they will probably do what previous party did - fast and easy bandaid by taking the money from ii pension fillar fund . 
  it was very controversial move , very doubtful legaly , but since previous gov did it , why ca n't they ? 
  ( that 's the logic we are dealing with ) they think in max 4 years ahead if we are lucky ( aka till next elections ) . 
  so they do n't really have to care , it will be a problem for future gov, 
  their glorification of [ upa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army ) ( and poles are not found of upa due to [ volhynia massacres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) ) for the most part / edit : also [ bonus ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jpim129.png ) + [ bonus 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/da3bsuy.png ), 
  no idea, 
  irish ( along with spanish ) people also made a very good impression during euro2012 thanks to [ incidents like this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5xb-erk4lo ), 
  you treat and expect to be treated by people from two first groups in a friendly manner , while problems start with the 3rd group . 
  that 's true especially for polls like this one . 
  red bar is the essence of the poll, 
  can not say for germany as i got no idea how it looked there . 
  it 's a complicatd problem - from one side chunk of our elite ( politicians , doctors , academics or artists ) was jewish or of jewish decent , but from other some jewish communities were very closed , creating ghettos , not speaking polish . 
  you can look up [ history of jews in poland during interwar period 1918 -- 1939 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_poland#interwar_period_1918.e2.80.931939 ) on wiki .
