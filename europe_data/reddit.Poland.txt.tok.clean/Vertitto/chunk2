  used only sport rifle . 
  seen `` shooting '' on parades i guess non of them count, 
  their flag rocks , not like yours - taken from west africa, 
  i like the current one way more, 
  there is office for that , but dunno for specifics . 
  why asking ? 
  you like their style or the opposite ? 
  nordics got crosses on flags, 
  looks like ugly version of estonia 's flag, 
  what have you been smoking ? 
  [ one of my fav shots of warsaw 's center ] ( http://www.fkw.strefa.pl/h/z44.jpg ) or this sky panorama from [ tour de pologne 2015 ] ( https://youtu.be/cifi7e5cmjs?t=31m39s ) < -- this may be the best shot taken of modern warsaw ( from 30:40 to 32:50 ) or this moving shot at the end from [ this war of mine trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gotk5dldvvi ), 
  a bit exaggeration it will be hard to find people who can name any of polish players/coaches aside from marcin gortat ( he got really known after he got to nba , he 's one of the biggest sport celebrity now acting in commercials , doing lot of events for children etc ) across all ages . 
  virtuspro players at least somehow resonate among below 30y group . 
  basketball is not really a sport that gets national hype . 
  it has nba fans and just people playing for fun or in school , but there 's nothing on national level like eg . 
  football , volleyball , handball , ski jumps , tennis etc, 
  they belong to each other < 3, 
  cough szopen cough ; ), 
  is it popular in your countries ? 
  it gets barely any tv coverage here - only short info in sport news . 
  i never heard anoyone talking about it in daily conversations , cs : go gets way more attention, 
   he became famous after participating in a tv show `` europa da si\u0119 lubi\u0107 '' ( europe can be liked ) which presented eu nations to poles who just joined the union then . 
  i loved that show . 
  also the finnish and spanish guys from the show are also recognisable , though they only act in commercials, 
  hey , got any proff that it 's not in poland ? 
  i can not find any info about it . 
  as for vests you can see it says `` stra\u017c graniczna '' at 0:18, 
  they are supposed to , but the `` will '' is very uncertain as it 's only on paper, 
  general idea is that everyone cares for his own butt -  will spanish die for baltics or does anyone care for british-argentinian conflict over falklands ? 
  [ support for eu army across member states ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fhleu/support_for_eu_army_in_member_states/ ), 
   if he closes shop for ramadan instead of christmas . 
  that 's freaking amazing bonus - when christmas come such people are worth gold just take shifts at work so people can get a day off for christmass in exchange for switch during ramadan . 
  we got this with orthodox people here, 
  you can secretly backdoor , people will think you are slovakia and noone will notice ; ), 
  well allah is just term for god in arabic , used by all : jews , christians and muslims . 
  it 's not a muslim reserved term ( just for info ), 
   you have 40 million ukrainians ( workers ) next door and your industrial output will explode . 
  we would need our own production companies and people to sell the staff to . 
  so far it does n't go as well ( we got few brands in cosmetics , clothing , urban transport - busses and trams or gaming , but that 's to few ) . 
  the problem i try to highlight is that there has been no sign of us possitive involvement . 
  their involvement so far ends up with fucking us over with military gear deals, 
  the nordstream issue is going on for 10 years already . 
  it 's not a new thing, 
   your government is about to make poland a new south korea to use as a regional power pawn against russia no sign for that so far, 
  omg that design, 
   i dont know a single person that is pro-muslim immigrant sorry but it only shows that you live in a pretty closed bubble . 
   the footage the media refuses to broadcast created by people that claim not to watch tv ... stop this circlejerk can not say for cnn or bbc , but most of those were shown on news channel of station in poland ( tvm , tvn24 : bi\u015a to be exact ) that gets most shit from right side for `` not showing '' such footage . 
  i imagine same happens in other countries, 
  in general the more organised and clear the refugees system is the more accepted it will get, 
  you should watch out for the arguments themselves people make . 
  people often show the kids , women and families pointing up the group we should help , not that it 's the general profile of refugees . 
   and public media have it harder to manipulate you . 
  eh from the other side internet can be even more manipulative as people follow their bias , there 's ton of missinformation that gets repeated over and over polarising people . 
  there 's ton of people with mindset `` tv always lies and my beloved portal is always right '' . 
  reading what pops up on facebook feed from my friends is sometimes really scarry starting from blunt strawmans , through distored information ending up with straight up lies, 
   we are welcoming them because every human has the right to apply vor asylum . 
  there are special procedures for that . 
  they can do it legaly . 
  would n't be so bad if germany helped enforce the rules instead of encourage people to break it and call of hungary that does it 's best trying to enforce it . 
  merkel fucked up the issue pretty much at each possible step so far, 
  such contextless videos are a cancer to the internet, 
  in suspense i imagine, 
   it 's a legit refugees strategy to treat eastern europeans like shit seems more right now, 
  hard to say for poland - gov is split and there 's pretty big protest against taking the migrants planned . 
  what about slovenia or portugal ? 
  have n't heard their stance, 
  for a change i guess . 
  germany is a benchmark, 
  yea i understand that , just wanted to know which value is shown, 
  as for projection it 's the optymistic values , `` averege '' or what ? 
  usually the projections are pictured like [ this ] ( http://www.nbp.pl/polityka_pieniezna/dokumenty/fan_gdp_2015_07_pl_big.png ) ( projection of polish gdp % y/y till 4q of 2017 , from 13 july 2015 by polish national bank ), 
  it was way before the pope 's call, 
  what would you expect from people for whom 15 ' c is cold and did n't even imagined that there are people living in temperatures at which you stop feeling cold and start feeling pain, 
  considering the religious extremes of middle east i highly doubt it would be a problem for anyone . 
  article 14 of the declaration of human rights ? 
  have you even read the short two bulletpoints of this article ? 
  declaration of human right has nothing to do with forcing assylum quotas on other nations, 
  hmm i always thought hungary had more people than czech, 
  what other things ? 
  i do n't think there 's another hateboner that is even close to being as strong or even widespread across the nation / edit : in case people treat this too seriously : the `` hateboner '' is a general distrust to anything russian gov does . 
  on day-to-day basis noone has anything thowards russian people . 
  only thing may be russian lang/accent grabing our attention if heard randomly . 
  general people relations from both sides comes down to drinking - both nations steorotipically expect each other to drink vodka - kind of situation like this : `` gosh i 'm not feeling like drinking , but he/she is russian/polish and it would weird to suggest anything other ... at least i will see if they got as strong heads as they say '' thought by two sides . 
  same in norway and iceland . 
  we are conquering the northen sea, 
   just stop wringing numbers that ca n't give you an answer i post numbers to ilustrate that there 's indeed a problem , not to explain reasons behind it, 
  event of them being so the dominant groups is enough to say there 's something wrong . 
   being out of work is not the same as being unwilling to work would be the case if they were n't the only groups who got such problems , especially in country with unemployment at around ~ 7 %, 
  nope . 
  you got tools like eurostat or national stats . 
  spent few minutes there or at least make a quick wikipedia search . 
  the high numbers people throw around are ** foreign born ** numbers , which also includes europeans eg . 
  ( 2015 data ) rotterdam has the highest percentage of foreigners from non-industrialised nations . 
  non-europeans make ~ 42 % ( i ' v counted `` other '' , which is big number as noneuropean ) . 
  religion wise muslims take 13 % of population, 
   how will europe and the eu look like 2025 2025 ? 
  pretty same as now, 
  same goes for poland `` hey you are being sent to poland '' `` it 's the hiper homogeneous , post-communist , poor , catholic country with weird lang ? '', 
  again this one ? 
  hmm where would such child be deported if the country he 's from stops existing ?
