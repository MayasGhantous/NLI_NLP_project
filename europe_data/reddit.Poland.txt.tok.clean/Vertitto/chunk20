  mayby in a simplified way you can say that there were jews that considered themselves poles and those who were strictly jews , not wanting to be part of anything else .

   well integrated into polish society on every level . 
  many people would not agree, 
  in such poll the negative is what matters , there 's little difference between sympathy and indifference, 
  - dresy ( [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dres ) ) - polish equivalent of english chav , the steorotypical squating slav ; vids : [ v-unit - dresy w kant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsaxdqtsmim ) ( comedy song about them ) and [ blok ekipa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwkjvav_rv4&amp;list=pldhsyudoiksbwx395dosgr8k93klz7yow&amp;index=1 ) ( cartoon ) , by some extension football hooligans can also be put in this category - moherowe berety ( [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohair_berets ) ) - old , extreme `` catholics '', 
  not really that sad - green is more like `` love '' , grey is `` like '' . 
  indifferent - neutral is still a possitive, 
   from russian people , towards whom we used to have various degrees of sympathy that 's true until it 's a firm `` russia never did any harm to anyone '' - type russian, 
   moroever , people in poland really like belarussian people !, 
  i would rather categorise them in the `` indifferent '' part - it 's the nation closest to poland in nearly all possible ways , yet irl relations are as if belarus did n't exist, 
   uh ... that 's actually a great thing for / r/etymologymaps that horse has already been beaten to death on various subs [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_germany ), 
  `` cute and adorable '' are worlds that describe how we hear czech lang best . 
  it 's as if little kid was trying to speak, 
  honestly i 'm surprised about this poll - only negative thing about asians in general i ' v expirienced was advice not to rent flats to them as it 's nearly impossible to get rid of the smell that stays after their cooking, 
  there 's some history to this - back in the day many jews were in favour of communism and later after ww2 dust has settled there has been ton of jews accusing poland/poles for often really absurd stuff and then there 's also `` jews rule the world '' people, 
  green - sympathy grey - indifferent red - antipathy blue - hard to say, 
  i guess romanians need some pr campaign in poland, 
   but i hear everyone calling them romowie these days . 
  i had the same impression hanging around academics and reading articles/watching tv , but after listening to random people on the bus or trips to my hometown i realized i lived in a bubble, 
  it 's a politically correct word , rarely used in everyday life . 
  the avarage person will use either rumuni ( as sad as it is ) or cyganie, 
  source ? 
  why the random `` the '' ? 
  many people are ignorant and equate roma with romanians . 
  gypsies are often wrongly called `` rumuni '' ( romanians ) instead of `` romowie '' ( roma ) . 
  due to that word `` rumun '' has negative connotations, 
   same goes for russia . 
  russia is european though - euro country that expaned outside europe , while turkey is middleeastern country that has little land in europe, 
  `` let 's make ukrainians feel even worse '' map , 
   80 % 4chan and big chunk of that is just dumb people opposed to trolls, 
   i do n't recall anything unexpected depends who expects what ; ), 
  a magic trip . 
  should also take one of stenaline 's party gdynia-karlskrona trips . 
  [ party during storm is best party ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiqfo-js-0g ) dunno what he expected though also what 's with murican discontentment with glorious europop ? 
  you can write a description of where you stand on the social and political things you care the most and ask people from specific countries on eg . 
  / r/askeurope or individual country subs, 
  polan still in green , hurrey !, 
  barely will have to read into that presentation later on, 
  that 's just the flaw of `` land x was originally ... '', 
   well , it 's a good guessing technique still . 
  would works marvelous for countries like hungary , 
  would be the case if the reason was n't `` couse god says so '' letter from bishops, 
  it 's easy to tell those two apart - swedish is the one that sounds nice , 
  well you got the stats in the link you provided ... 
  which was origianally polish before that , [ polish amoeba borders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavvwluywo0 ), 
  `` split it between france and netherlands ! '', 
  - best , totaly ingenious idea ever, 
  on yt though, 
  get used to that .

  well mayby i should look deeper into my family tree , i might have lithuanian roots ; p ( for know i know my grandgrandparents were from podlasie/warsaw/lviv regions ), 
  was it the uni that was threaten with striping from degreeing rights if it continues with the curse ? 
  i remember it was loud some time ago about some uni that was put between the decision to either have homepopathy or to be a higher education institution, 
  [ best flag ever ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/great_chor%c4%85%c5%bcy_of_the_polish_crown.jpg ) ( just remove the king 's heraldy , and update with modern coas ) i love flags with coa on them, 
  yea remove the african flag !, 
  and what are you looking for ? 
   `` auskas '' ( owski ) rendering my surname through this feels really weird , especially when it 's quite popular surname in poland ( 13th most popular as for january ' 15 ) - jankowski --  jankauskas, 
  it 's also quite common in poland . 
  for `` 101 surnames suffixes '' i would say it 's more characteristic for belarusians, 
  hey baltics is the thing about requirement of flag on house true ? 
  belarusian to be exact - ski for polish - wicz for belarusian - ov for russian - enko or - uk for ukrainian btw \u010d ( do n't confuse with \u0107 ) = cz , v = w, 
  couse it sounds more latin ? 
  i would go with famous movie [ psikuta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5z3gbdyg2q ) . 
  it 's very close to `` psi kutas '' ( = dog 's dick ) gist of the scene from link : - ( policeman ) : mr. psikutas ? 
  ( = dog 's dick ) - ( dude ) : hey !, 
  do you see '' - s '' written at the end ? 
  read how it 's written !, 
  - ( policeman ) : oh , indeed . 
  then mr. psikutas without s or already famous here , german trolling [ brz\u0119czyszczykiewicz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ), 
  look up my comment . 
  it 's not about the meaning , but person . 
  it 's lithuanian version of polish surname - mickiewicz . 
  just polish-lithuanian commonwealth ethnicity problems, 
  oh you little bastard : ) ------------------------------ ** context for non polish/lithuanian/belarusian ** it 's surname of big poet [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adam_mickiewicz#ethnicity ) . 
  lithuanians say he was lithuanian to overrustle poles . 
  just polish-lithuanian commonwealth ethnicity problems, 
  only one have , but european ( main ) russia takes nearly 40 % of europe ... 
  puts turkey , but omits russia , eh ... for people wondering it 's 16 in russia, 
  they negotiated it iirc . 
  eu pays turkey for holding them, 
   as long as you do n't disagree with putin why would anyone disagree with putin ?

  becouse france is . 
  why to have 2 bases so close to each other ; ), 
  why to have soviet if you can have putin statues ? 
  i finally feel free to say what i really mean without the fear of being downvoted, 
   it 's a child when it 's born that 's debatable  if you want to make that illegal why not lock up all the women that have unsuccessful pregnancies ? 
  that 's like murder right ? 
  very bad example, 
   there 's a whole lot more to humans than being an unconscious mass of cells , otherwise we 'd be murdering thousands with each masturbation session . 
  that 's one of the dumbest arguments possible, 
  without oil , 
  shame on you then, 
  what 's next ? 
  universities open astrology & witchcraft departments ?
