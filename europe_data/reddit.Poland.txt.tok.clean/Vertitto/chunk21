  how so ? 
  as much as ( if not more ) uk was during colonial days . 
  it 's just en european beast whose long puffy tail is in asia, 
  no hard data , just specultion . 
  it 's still a niche , quite expensive and lenghty procedure , compared to use of contraception, 
  i guess you may got me wrng - i meant that rising birthrates is not their main reasoning, 
  the article makes good point  critics of the plan to ban prescription-free morning after pills say it will make it more expensive and ** more difficult for women to obtain them , especially in smaller towns . 
  i doubt that 's the reasoning , but i 'm pretty sure about the effect, 
  limiting access to contraception would have by enormous magnitude far bigger impact than funding ivf, 
  yea , pis working on fixing birthrates , 
   but a country can not maintain strong growth rates while closing its borders to ** skilled workers who are fleeing war and terror while seeking peace and prosperity . 
  ** lol . 
  author 's equating refugees with scientists emigrating to silicon valley or people emgrating to work is hilarious to say the least . 
  it 's one of the lowest articles on this matter i ' v seen in quite some time , regardless if one is for or against accepting refugees, 
  poland & slovakia is supposed surpass slovenia and czech , wow repost though https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3r0adv/gdp_in_ppp_per_capita_in_eu_1980_2050_projections/, 
  as for that ... w\u00f3dka originated from poland , 
  this is one of the dumbest things i ' v read in few weeks, 
  yea internet hillbillies that after seeing their future paycheck burst with laughter, 
  last one still is n't over couse of kuril islands ... 
  [ \u0141om\u017ca ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%81om%c5%bca#miasta_partnerskie ) there was mayby some school exchange in high school , but only one i remember was with some school in france and we do n't have any partnership town in france, 
   time left before the eu puts the blame for terrorist activities squarely on russia 's secret police : 3 . . 2 . . 1 . . was that ever the case ? 
  never seen such accusations in poland, 
  could you explain ? 
  mayby i 'm just tired , but i got no idea what do you even have in mind, 
  depending how you count it may already have happend ( 2008 ) 38,1 mln poles in poland and 21mln of polonia ( = polish disapora ) . 
  according to [ wiki ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/polonia ) polish diaspora is one of the largest in the world as well as one of the most widely dispersed, 
  [ wiki ( 2011 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_republic_of_ireland#nationality ) : mainly poles and british , a bit less lithuanians and latvians, 
  i can not say if you are serious right now, 
  ask about that in those republics ; ), 
  alexander iii of macedon was also a slav !, 
  the `` house price '' seems really weird to me . 
  here it 's price per square metre that is usually compared, 
  what does even `` average house price '' mean ? 
  more commie blocks for uk !, 
  from a more positive side [ wig-ukrain ] ( http://stooq.pl/c/?s=wig_ukrain&amp;c=1y&amp;t=l&amp;a=lg ) ( index made of 7 ukrainian companies or companies who work mainly in ukraine listed on warsaw se ) has had a lil recovery in the span of a year . 
  76 % of that index is kernel holding ( 40 % ) and astarta holding ( 36 % ) , both from agro sector, 
  mayby if they switched colors - rooten green red do n't look cool . 
  portugal has similar color palette , but done right - the colours are more alive and gold/white coa suplements it nicely . 
  i 'm fan of their folk pattern though, 
  church poeple will say that sunday is first day of the week in poland, 
  - [ gda\u0144sk old town ] ( http://www.aerovideo.pl/starowka.html ) ( you can see the rafinery towers from gdynia ) - [ elbl\u0105g ] ( http://www.aerovideo.pl/elblag.html ), 
  the eagle looks like rorschach test painting though, 
  oh sorry , link did n't copy itself, 
  worst : [ belarus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/flag_of_belarus_%281995-2012%29.svg/2000px-flag_of_belarus_%281995-2012%29.svg.png ) ( while the pattern is neat , the ugly soviet colours ruin it ; their [ alternate flag with coa ] ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100214165411/althistory/images/1/19/belarus_flag_with_coa.png ) is way better ) or [ lithuania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/flag_of_lithuania.svg/2000px-flag_of_lithuania.svg.png ) ( those colors look like it was stolen from some african country ) best : [ estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/flag_of_estonia.svg/2000px-flag_of_estonia.svg.png ) , [ russia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/f/f3/20120812153730!flag_of_russia.svg ) ( my fav tri color ones ) and [ czech ] ( http://www.freelargeimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/czech_republic_flag.png ) i generally like most designs , especailly the verisions with coa on them . 
  my top flags are from non european countries though : [ kazahstan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/flag_of_kazakhstan.svg/1280px-flag_of_kazakhstan.svg.png ) , [ iran ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/flag_of_iran.svg/2000px-flag_of_iran.svg.png ) ( modern one ) , [ qatar ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/flags/images/world-flags/qatar-flag.jpg ) / [ bahrain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/flag_of_bahrain.svg/2000px-flag_of_bahrain.svg.png ) , [ israel ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/flag_of_israel.svg/2000px-flag_of_israel.svg.png ) or [ s.korea ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/flag_of_south_korea.svg/2000px-flag_of_south_korea.svg.png ) for historical ones : [ prussia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/flag_of_prussia_%281892-1918%29.svg ) and [ plc ] ( http://img.interia.pl/wiadomosci/nimg/i/3/flaga_rzeczpospolitej_3898333.jpg ) ( i wish we still used that design with current eagle inside the golden ornaments ), 
  for poland you can also hear `` no '' quite often , mayby also `` tak jest '' ( more military shade , something like `` yes sir ! '' ), 
  we also have variant with the czech `` ano '' in form of `` ano tak '' - it works like `` ah , yes '', 
  few similar to 9gag : - [ demotywatory ] ( http://demotywatory.pl/ ) ( supposed to be about demotivating , ironic or funny situations ) - [ kwejk ] ( http://kwejk.pl/ ) polish 9gag ( though quality is often lower , ton of reposts from 9gag ) - [ mistrzowie ] ( http://mistrzowie.org/ ) ( internet fails , cheeky remarks , burns ) - [ sadistic ] ( http://www.sadistic.pl/ ) ( dark humor , more nsfw/l ; got quite lite over the years ) the captions are usually in polish though, 
   xenophobia i do n't think you know what you are talking about, 
  what exact rights are they protesting for ? 
  i 'm not really into convoluted religious quirks , but was n't jesus all about `` treat everybody as if you treated me '' and since he is god that would put love thowards people in line with love thowards god ? 
  ( that line of thinking has many diverging points though ) heretic situation would be in this case putting human above god, 
  iirc putting another human above yourself , on pair with god is the most important value of christianity ( at least according to catholic church ), 
  cheap vs cheaper, 
  freezing ? 
  nah as a matter of fact there 's barely any wind for 3city standards iirc last year this time of the year i was watching if my windows are still intact, 
  you are on european sub , would be nice if you used normal units, 
  lol where did you get that info from ? 
  well , you are judging by english speaking internet - it 's hard to expect to be finding people that do not understand it - would you be lurking around polish forums without knowing polish ? 
   most importently it 's everywhere - internat , media , business , academics , entertainment . 
  it 's the language of the western world . 
  you need to shield yourself pretty hard or live under a rock not to expirience it . 
  on top of that it 's one of the subjects in school that receives most hours ( on pair with polish and mathematics ) , there 's big pressure to know it so ton of people do curses along the schooltime + additional specialist curses later on, 
  meanwhile 3city , poland nice , quite sunny , a bit chilly day, 
  yea i know . 
  just wanted to give simple examples with some contrast to them . 
  i will mayby expirience that in my lifespan , 
  criticising eu is n't the same as anti-eu, 
  that 's another thing ( that 's obviously important characteristic , but we are starting to split the hairs ), 
  as i said they give different perspective . 
  chosing either has its consequences . 
  all depends what is the goal of using the indicator . 
  after all who cares about other countires , it matters most how more is left to get to germany 's level , 
  yes - in all cases the bigger it is ( nominal , per capita , ppp , national , growth , growth speed etc ) the better it is . 
  they are just different shades of a phenomenon, 
  not really true . 
  there 's no correct way of comparing gdp and nominal is n't useless . 
  they just give a different perspective . 
  ppp is better if your goal is to compare `` wealth of population '' , wheras nominal when you eg . 
  want to assess country 's risk before buying their bonds, 
  no , no . 
  it has little to do with income . 
  ( eli5 ) think it rather in terms of how much is worth what a country produces ( gdp ) , then it gets divided by number of people ( per capita ) and later adjusted by `` indicator '' telling more or less how expensive it is to live in a country ( ppp ) . 
  it 's just a small aesthetic , not really that important since you used color gradient . 
  kudos for puting the time, 
  was just posted in separate thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4b4ieo/map_of_europe_showing_gdp_in_ppp_per_capita/ data also from imf, 
  lack of thousand separators really ruins it for me portugal one more year , 
  is it really that awful ? 
  it 's noticable mostly in the huge metropilitan areas eg . 
  capitals or the banana . 
  in other regions , even in big cities it 's not a problem to see the stars on a cloudless night . 
  i wonder if `` standard '' air pollution does n't have much bigger impact on blocking the view this projection gives very exagerated impression . 
   as this subreddit is mainly visited by people with a decidedly anti-eu stance i doubt many people would agree with you on that . 
  that 's conspiracy way of thinking - you are putting imaginary intentions on things without any, 
  there 's no context to the map that would require the use of one type of data over another . 
  it 's just a simple infographic, 
   this is a bit ( deliberately ? ), 
  misleading this is the problem when giving stats to wider audience - they do n't read titles and make dumb assumptions . 
  map shows exactly what is says : imf 's estimates for nominal gdp per capita . 
  there 's nothing misleading about it,
