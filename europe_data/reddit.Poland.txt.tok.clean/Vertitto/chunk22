  the weird thing is that it got much darker for moldova, 
  ah ukraine and moldova, 
  could you make one for ppp to have both maps in the same thread ? 
   cheap cities  like amsterdam top kek, 
  they got too weak heads, 
  that 's why i ' v written '' ( potential ) '', 
  similar to polish but i guess easier to pronounce for anglo native, 
  go to polan instead ; ), 
  bad luck jihadist ( potential ) going by steorotypes thinking they can bribe eastern yuropeans to get a gun . 
  chose a highly anti-muslim , super homogeneous , strickt arms law poland and try to do that in front of a ex-commando that does anti-terrorist seminars ( shop owner ) and on-duty military men . 
  could n't pick a worse target , 
  that depends how the region evolves - will it join either russia or ukraine or mayby it will be left as a stalemate warzone . 
  in the 2nd case the future is rather grim, 
  or it will be just left to root like some shithole, 
  part of the party is like that . 
  does n't help when lider of their party wants to make his brother ( ex president who died at that crash ) a national martyr hero, 
  hard to say , i ' v not been looking into it yet - there 's nearly half year till the elections . 
  ask the question around the end of august  bernie us trying to catch up to rest of 1st world . 
  seems ok for me  hilary looks like `` safe populist '' - `` i do n't know anything , got no opinion on anything , but i will make everything better '' . 
  from the little i follow i got no idea why would anyone vote for her  trump it was hilarious at first , now it getting pretty scarry, 
   i 'm not saying it 's a good thing though , just do n't come all butthurt to me when i say that your country has been colonized , you 're in the eu now , stop your freaking nationalism thinking your nation is the best and has always been the greatest . 
   and if your defense minister is so smart ( ... ) that 's the problem , you have a discussion with an imaginary strawmen . 
  read what i write and do n't make weird assumptions, 
  so magically over 700 years do n't count ? 
  how convinient , 
  sometimes it 's an illusion ( to some point ) as during some periods the coast was a fief ( autonomy region would be the term for modern times ) of polish crown, 
   nobody over here thinks that it means anything but `` death camps that were located in poland '' you would be surprised may be case for now . 
  but after few years of such negligence it can easly be swaped around . 
  hell , even now there are people accusing poland of nazi crimes . 
   most of the history of your nation has basically been being colonized by a powerful neighbor . 
  sorry but how old is poland in you opinion ? 
  `` polish death camps '' i guess can not think of anything else, 
  mods do that, 
  does n't change anything though - it 's a low , dumb argument . 
  a thing a school kid would say , not a diplomat, 
  [ full polish amoeba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavvwluywo0 ) video, 
  well poland was also one of the early ones ( since around xvi ) - [ golden liberty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_liberty ), 
  ytcomment level of banter, 
   whereas populists are in coming back to power in the east ( poland , slovakia ) previous party was also populist, 
  tax law - it 's pretty much a common law now where each tax deparment has it 's own interpretation even for most straightforward cases . 
  ( different magnitude though , i ' v overexagerated ; ) ), 
  it 's same everywhere tbh, 
  we have n't had a firm law in poland yet so statement about two sources of law being a crisis loses it 's value . 
  there 's big room for reforms it will become problematic if govs start to do that on daily basis though, 
  mayby for english native . 
  from what i heard it 's not that hard as people picture it to be - the writting is pain in the ass though, 
   50 % of the catholics believe that jesus is the son of god . 
  hmm is n't believing that jesus is the son of god a prerequisite to be catholic ? 
  crisis is just a big word for what is happening, 
  like black redhead jew reptilians controlling the world ? 
  definitly german, 
  you overestimate the `` democratic crisis '' we expirience now . 
  they could use it as a yellow card for the pis though . 
  best way would be them coming and criticizing what rulling party does in other words : no need to , democracy is not in crisis , but they can make political move to make pis thinking ( but then again - nato is not a vehicle for that ), 
  what the hell, 
  it 's already in making , just look up [ the map ] ( http://www.wielkarzeczpospolita.net/img/mapa_big.jpg ) + [ this ] ( http://www.wielkarzeczpospolita.net/img/mapamarsa_big.jpg ) . 
  it 's already in motion and nobody can stop it . 
  were i you , i would be starting learning polish, 
  polan will create brand new sector and rule the world with lazors, 
   maybe it 's a cold war mindset . 
  then russia should definitly be eastern europe . 
  puting it aside is result of equating europe with eu, 
   sounds like an eastern europeans wet dream . 
  i do n't think russia is eagerly dreaming about losing power, 
  george friedman 's stratfor , 
  general : yes main things to sort out before they even get considered : relation with kurds and armenia , peace in their neighbouring countires , their relation with religion, 
  living in 3city i would n't agree with the map ( may be true if they made the measurements right next to shipyards though ), 
  [ random travel vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp1e28tkfp0 ) ( seriously looking at various vblogs and travel guides it 's very clean ), 
  as for that - how similar is the law ? 
  would such unification be hard technically ? 
  one of my cusins got married to slovak and they got a baby . 
  they are speaking both slovak and polish at home so the kid speaks something inbetween - it 's hilarious , confusing and cute in the same time . 
  when/where-ever they bring her , she is the main attraction ( kid is attention seeker type ) . 
  my friend who has been in turkey for erasmus said turkish is very similar sounding to swedish , which is weird, 
  way smaller userbase though, 
  added 2 more regional, 
  nope , just the songs happen to be from disney . 
  non of polish kids movies songs stuck in my head - the stories were okeish , but the music was usually terrible, 
   poland bans abortions , it 's legal when : - the woman 's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy , - the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act , or - the fetus is seriously malformed, 
   and we should not treat it as an reason to be shamed of . 
  and used as a criterion to be more ` progressive ' or ` western ' . 
  yes , but up to a point where people 's argument is `` cosue god said so '', 
  oh there was also one where ukraine comes to poland/lithuania and wants to join us to make commonwealth again . 
  it ends up with poland and lithuania sitting in a carrige whipping ukriane that works as a horse : ),

  for me personally ( grew up in north-eastern poland ) it would be `` smell '' of dry , cold air and smell of forest mixed with lake water, 
  depends how you tweak the knobs ( indicator weighs ) . 
  in general we got pretty good stats in this regard,

  it also had a bonus of having supply of good meat , butter and bread etc, 
  but why ? 
  pretty weird gimmick / edit : seeing the croatian one , do we also have such custom designs in poland ? 
  i ' v never seen or heard about such, 
  we should ditch brussels and strasbourg and build a fucking castle for yurop hq, 
  either sign and wait few years for assigned flat or steal materials and build yourself a home, 
  that depends on the country .
