  come on , [ szkieletor ] ( http://plfoto.com/zdjecia_new/1286970.jpg ) in krak\u00f3w wins for poland, 
   he would spend 30 minutes every morning shouting down the phone to his colleagues back in poland and i swear , he never paused for breath for the whole call . 
  some different sample then : [ short extract with tadeusz sznuk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oghmakwo78 ) ( well known presenter from a quiz show ) or [ witcher3 polish voice actors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebdrckj3ieo ), 
  it 's pretty hard to explain , you pronounce/accent letters like `` t '' , `` l '' or `` r '' in a very pleasing manner, 
  i like swedish ( i love the melody ) and finnish ( finnish `` rolling '' letters sound great ) most and czech is really cute ( i guess this works only for polish speakers ) can not pick the worst one, 
  come on you can not hate slovenians - they are like estii of the south, 
  bosnians and albanians are ok ? 
  the fact that it had been greatest is the past is exact reason why it ~ ~ is ~ ~ can be mocked now, 
  you forgot to attach some asterisks, 
  i will tell you tomorrow ^ ^ postponing ^ infinitely, 
   it 's convenient that the currency is the same not really yet, 
  why startrek ? 
  stargate is way better , also in atlantis they got german scientists and 2nd in command sciantist is czech - [ radek zelenka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzj90p338m8 ) ( and a scot as leading medic - carson beckett ), 
  sg command , good enough ; ), 
  i do n't see how they count as evidence to the case . 
  looks more like opinion of armchair `` communism was better , all had jobs ... '' - type of specialist, 
  i would make 2 broaded and include the law as a whole - chunk of it is outdated and some articles have been patched so many times that you need a phd to get some sense out of it and even then reallife application can be different, 
  but it 's not the subreddit that is the point of the post , but content of the thread on that sub . 
  it 's just like sharing maps from / r/mapporn that happens quite often, 
  so copy/paste is ok , but linking not ? 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%81 ) about the letter, 
  english w is polish \u0142 ( in most words i guess ) english v is polish w ( always ) there 's no v in polish , v ( along with x ) is used only for foreign words, 
  being phonetic is more of a gradient than a yes/no type of problem and english is pretty far from being as phonetic as italian , hungarian , finnish or polish wiki describes english as `` having defective orthography '' or `` english orthography is highly non-phonemic '' . 
  article on jstor goes by the same route with tl ; dr : english is a phonetic language ( but so are all languages by definition ) , but its spelling is not entirely phonetic ( or more precise phonemic ) - the 26 letter alphabet does not represent all the 33 phenomes unambiguosly, 
  phonetic alphabet means that writting corresponds with speaking . 
  in english there 's pretty big disparity between what 's writen and what 's spoken ; in other words if do n't know how to pronounce the words you see for the first time there 's high chance the language is not phonetic ( example : himym series where ted misspronounces `` chameleon '' saying he only seen it written ) or knowing the alphabet alone is not enough to read,

  not the `` dry '' dark bread though , it sucks, 
   germans love bread never heard about such steorotype,

  iirc the documents were `` found '' few days ago ( to clarify : i do n't say it 's ok for representatives like the presidents to jump on the bandwagon and ruin someones reputations , but i disagree it 's a reason to go on streets with `` he 's our hero and he could n't have done something like that , therfore i protest '' ), 
  there 's the documents so the `` attack '' is justified . 
  if people are not satisfied with the validity of the proof , then they should examine the evidence and go to court . 
  it 's not a reason to make a march . 
  mayby `` w x minucie s\u0142ycha\u0107 strza\u0142y '' ( = you can hear shoots fired in x minute ) - some people heard firing shoots on one of the crash videos ; it become an annoying meme , that was posted on many videos .

  nonsense so let 's denay facts not to spoil a symbol ? 
  can someone explain to me why they defend walesa ? 
  i fail to see any sense in it, 
  i mean it stands out in the gdp/capita sense  for example how much richer is warsaw comparing to krakow , lodz , poznan , gdansk or wroclaw ? 
  the difference is noticable in both wages and living costs between warsaw and others , mostly due to many companies hq ( msot international ones ) being in warsaw, 
  the thing is bratislava stands out compared to other similar countries/capitals . 
  for one prague is similar , but then as you said `` many multinational corporations have hq for czech and slovak republics in prague '' . 
  here 's another worm to cover that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnjokhj_sy, 
  in poland rather nothing . 
  most people probably could n't even pinpoint it correctly on the map . 
  pretty much only thing albanian-related that happened recently here is comedy hip-hop project named `` gang albanii '' song : [ alba\u0144ski raj ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fws8hwdtddq ) ( albanian paradise ), 
  europa for europeans !, 
  going by this logic any adivce is shitty considering it 's not certain . 
  he can always try it , it 's not like he has something to lose by trying going by this route, 
  a bit overshot , but you could say that due to state of estate market there 's less people living there , compared to what it could be possible if it was easier to buy flat there influencing the `` capita '' part of equation, 
  lecs\u00f3 - no1 summer/autumn food in poland , food of students < 3, 
  can not say for previous one , but as for this thread your post is straight up dumb - a vent for your downvote butthurt, 
  why ? 
  you would have to find some ukrainian or belarusian forum . 
  imo it 's doable, 
  learn some polish history & language and apply for card of the pole , [ a chance for better future ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47ilph/poland_lures_the_best_migrants_in_the_world_from/ ) ; ), 
  it 's not a ban , but `` unrecognised '' state, 
  i got curious as i do n't remember poland having had to change anything . 
  i guess we had enough ; ), 
   in fact they have the minimum of legal rights because eu demands it could you elaborate ? 
  lot of people are very ignorant about the problem , simple education could make a big swing, 
  this list is hilarious : they pick a city , say that everything related to safty is very good and give some irrelevant trivia . 
  also when looking for pictures vids , try to watch recent ones ( 2014/15/16 ) . 
  parts of europe change really fast, 
  at first i though you were just joking . 
  i guess you are simply a bigot, 
  untill that happens poland will cease to exist due to negative population growth, 
  pretty even split like always  btw what 's the date of the survay ? 
  in no way russian is older than belarusian/ukrainian/polish . 
  also how come polish become east slavic ? 
  someone got confused, 
  if polan is eastern europe then everyone is !, 
  i would love to have access to such `` high interest rates '' , 
  islands i guess, 
   russian population the whole 0.2 % ( 2011 ) of population ? 
  totally non biased character ; ), 
   it 's government and the people were practically raped by the eu what the fuck ? 
  have heard lot of bad things in this regard about istanbul - it 's comperable to turisty parts of spain-italy-france . 
  you may find walter world 's [ 9 reasons why you got robbed while traveling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzuawluvris ) , [ 5 safety tips for traveling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omj6mc6xcq4 ) and [ travel safety : pickpockets & scam artists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzki5tbxx64 ) useful also scan your documents ( id , passport etc ) and have it in pdf on your mail/phone just in case, 
  though turks will be glad to be considered europe ; ), 
  depends on questioned group . 
  may be just a bad poll there will be different answers to `` do you like the eu '' and `` do you think it was a good idea to join '', 
  twitter is barely a thing here , so no, 
  [ map in question ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/poles_in_belarus_share_2009.png/300px-poles_in_belarus_share_2009.png ), 
  come on , it 's greek - they got words for dozens of weird , complicated things . 
  do n't tell me they do n't have universe-world-earth system ; ), 
  is n't greek kosmos more like universe than world ( = earth ) ? 
  does it mean anything in italian ? 
  special forces indeed, 
  i wonder how in the hell twitter is popular in the first place - it 's most usless socialmedia outlet - it 's not good at anything may it be chat , forum , pictures , keeping in touch with friends , videos etc, 
  my bet is that noone uses it in poland and it 's just germans that are in poland , 
  certainly not [ greater albania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ygc1oi.png ) though , 
   you are able to drink piwo z sokiem malinowym it 's an exclusively girly thing though ( and it needs a straw to be complete ), 
  well duh , they are all the same ... 
  the title should be written with greek alphabet though and year written using roman numerals, 
  i guess poland alone would be a region big enough . 
  if i had to pick it would probably be czech and slovakia due to cultural/language similarity .
