  i doubt they would like to be `` fuzed '' with us though, 
  the rulling party is assosiated with a jokingly `` true pole '' concept : nationalistic , extremally catholic , supporter of both pis and radio maryja ( infamous catholic radio ) , anti german/russian/jew / communist/mason/leftist / gay ( and list goes on and on ) . 
  hey you got cool entry in our [ favourite ww2 comedy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_wgbipz5m8 ), 
  `` fuck belgium for not having a meaningfull relation with us '' mayby ? 
  best kind of thread, 
  not having a border for a longer time in modern times surely is a key factor to the friendship , 
  obviously but i just gave it as an example of generic destination where people just lock themselves up in a hotel area an sit at the pool/beach sunbathing and having drinks, 
  hmm why is czech slowing down ? 
  last time they had over 4 % nice to see greece going up again, 
  they do n't like to be on lists , 
  polan also got to the club ; ), 
  [ trip to mi\u0144sk 2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeccztr3wao ) or [ belarus travel promo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx6i24aq7lg ), 
  just like [ him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hurjkotpu ) ? 
  you two drifted a bit from talking about safety to rating severity of human rights problem, 
  i would be a bit worried when traveling between cities , but in the cities and sights themselves the `` organic '' trafic would be the scariest thing imo, 
  i would probably also go to iasi as i got some internet friends over there, 
  pretty nice place to visit . 
  it 's relatively hard to get into from some countries and it 'd be very useful to know russian , but aside from that it 's just ok . 
  i dunno why people just straight out cross it out as if it was some war zone, 
   belarus could you say why ? 
  i would love to visit iran , i ' v been thinking about it for almost 2 years now - watched few food documentaries and travel vblogs that got me really hyped about it . 
  had i had the money atm i would just go . 
  from europe it would probably be slovenia with their lake bled , gent in belgium or cluj-napoca in romania as for least - probably some steorotypical holiday restort/beach eg . 
  canaries , ibiza etc, 
   is n't brain drain an issue for poland ? 
  yep , a very big issue  and how will your social security programs cope ? 
  current answers are rather bandaides fixes - like moving money from one fund to another or trying to encourage people to make children like eg pis project 500pln for each kid . 
  no answer for the brain drain in short : it 's sucks, 
  usually just use names or every day objects . 
  but usually it 's not necessary since unlike english or french , polish is mostly written just as it 's pronounced ( i forgot the term , it 's called phonetic languge ? ), 
  - once you learn the alphabet you pretty much can read/write anything you hear in the language , there 's no `` i dunno how to pronounce it as i ' v only seen it written '' situation . 
  it 's pretty much the only sphare where polish is way easier than english, 
  if you just speak only about the eu funds stream then yes , you are correct, 
   we pay for everything and get nothing back lol, 
   in fact the female fertility rate is among lowest in europe irc that applies only to women in poland . 
  polish women in living in western countries got very high ( comparatively ) fertility rate . 
  not boring enough when you got your masters degree or finals to be written . 
  just look how fucking exciting [ bizons ] ( http://www.lasy.gov.pl/informacje/kampanie_i_akcje/zubryonline ) are , 
  wow one of the dumbest name for an animal - why call it human fish when it does n't have characteristics of neither of those ? 
  oo someone must have been really high baby dragons are cool though btw since it 's so `` important '' do you have live stream for procrastinating students ? 
  we got ton of such streams - you can watch pandas , bizons , monkeys , birds etc , 
  [ finland does n't exist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2qjohv/what_did_your_parents_show_you_to_do_that_you/cn6pn30?context=3 ), 
   or now when sex life of our little human fish is the main theme of tv news . 
  explain please, 
  see ? 
  you so rich now , 
  well it 's how it 's officially called in some languages eg . 
  glad ? 
  now i will have to live in shame ... 
  pm me with link to the thread if you got please , 
  bring back the classics - city states all the way !, 
  be even more free and prosperous nation , leave the uk !, 
  many wows such wise bestest prophet, 
  i got corrected on europen geography/politics by a ` murican . 
  i 'm gon na go and sob in a corner now for the rest of the day ; (, 
  a question popped up to my head regarding food - are there any polish products in shops if so - what are they ? 
  i 'm biased to my sense of aesthetics ; ) that shade of red looks `` rotten '' , pretty grim to me . 
  i find it pretty weird pick for a flag . 
  definitly unique though, 
  lately belarus was shown pretty much only in the ukraine conflict aspect ( mediations etc ) . 
  from time to time there 's some news about some jurnalists or politicians being prosecuted or some trivia that some paraglider by mistake landed in belarus and belarusian border guard was super pissed . 
  only people i met/heard of were people with polish roots who decided to work in poland or to study here  bia\u0142a podlaska 's biedronka supermarket is frequently raided by belarusian shoppers from brest i thought food is cheaper in belarus, 
  as opposed to free and prosperous nation it is now in eu ? 
  i would call it original , not necessarily nice, 
  everyone knows that it 's poland that rules this sub, 
  i do n't think that there 's general connotation battle of varna -  bulgaria . 
  it 's rather battle of varna -  ottomans, 
  in poland they are imo most known for [ golden sands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_sands ), 
  belarus is pretty weird - we share nearly whole history with them , we border them and yet there 's nearly no interaction between the countries , they are like a blank spot on the map, 
  [ trip to mi\u0144sk 2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeccztr3wao ) or [ belarus travel promo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx6i24aq7lg ) - may at least give some idea how it looks . 
  it 's not an ugly shithole that many people imagine ; ) also since it 's so often picked here : [ geography now !, 
  belarus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasqsotxkhk ) and [ history of belarus in 5min ( with english subs ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxlagbg9qkm ) ( more western/nationalistc oriented ) - imo pretty decent introduction, 
  i would say albania or montenegro aside from school physical geography of the region + capital and polandball i did n't know pretty much anything more about it , they did n't seem to stand out compared to other ex-yugo another one would probably be armenia if we count caucasus, 
  would n't bohemia be simpler for czecho-silesia ? 
  also sealand stronk !, 
  indeed, 
  this time is more legit though ( though weird when russia has been russia since nearly forever ), 
  poland better of than czech ? 
  but iphones are for hipsters , android rulz, 
  i got confused couse o\u015bwi\u0119cim ( auschwitz ) is part of ma\u0142opolska now ( which was in general government ) , while it was in upper silesia then, 
  general government was [ part of the reich ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:german_reich_1942.svg ) , another more detailed [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_germany#/media/file:greater_german_reich_ns_administration_1944.png ) ah sorry it may be that then it was indeed part of upper silesia . 
  i was n't awere it had different boundaries then . 
  we could use consumend banans per person as well, 
   auschwitz was constructed in and operated in the third reich 's province of ~ ~ upper silesia ~ ~ ~ ~ lesser poland ( ma\u0142opolska ) if you speak about polish division or generalgouvernement in german and the camp was under ss supervision ( like all other camps ) ~ ~ i was wrong it was indeed in upper silesia region back then, 
  keep in mind that in some languages/cultures there 's no difference between a nation and country, 
  yes , but where the f he got that from ? 
   polish he has some power during war . 
  during peace time he is for pretty much for ceremocials , nominates few possitions and can be a nuisance for gov by downvoting ( sends back for one more voting with higher treshhold ) their bills, 
  russian ones : - [ would you help a girl ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e4trvqy9rw ) - [ the public rape experiment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12lmvrcwyw ) poland : - [ women violence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsh_vbmlihy ), 
  the hangover : gibraltar ? 
   worldview trying to be objective , trying to understand different angles , leaning a bit more to the left , more inclined to think pessimistically  ethno history polish from both sides pretty much the whole way up to 5 generations back - part of family was from around warsaw , other from lviv and podlasie region . 
  do n't have any big ancestors i know of , most of family was farmers/small service . 
  mother works as internal supervisor in small bank branch , father owns a small airconditioning company ( ac and vents for mostly big office buildings ) , both come from around the town i was born in . 
  lived in ~ 60k town in eastern poland , since studies i live in 3city ( northen poland ) . 
  languages : polish , english ~ c1/c2 ( has deteriorated after highschool ) , very little german and swedish ( heve n't used them much and my brain just melted those two together ) . 
  i prefer when people refer to me via name , surname or mr.name / surnme , i hate dimunitives  kinship rather carring . 
  my family goes by the rule `` you see how succesful/wealthy you are by how your children live '' . 
  there 's also been strong family connections - not only vertical kids-parent-grands , but also horizontal with cusins . 
  when it comes to nurses - only when it 's really necessary - family is the main resort .
