  as for how i would like nurses to act thowards me - just simple kindness , no special attention  cultural values can not think of anything for this category  what professional nursing care practices or attitudes do you believe have been or would be most helpful to your wellbeing within the hospital or home ? 
  medical ones  folk care beliefs and practices home remedies : simplest drugs like aspirin ; natural ones like lemon , tea , garlic , honey ; for hard times wormwood ( i hope it 's the right english name - pio\u0142un ) i had that shit once and hope not to get it again . 
  aside from some witchcraft/shaman/pseudoscience bullshit nothing would be `` taboo '', 
  [ potato cake ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/o/a/forum/522/2/522265.jpg ) - best cake, 
  also russia and belarus is the same country . 
  poland and russia are not the same hence belarus exists , 
  judging from my facebook feed the opposite statemanet would be more correct, 
  you would be surprised, 
  you may understand now , but there 's dozens of people who do n't , especially after it being repeated over and over, 
  is n't it pretty dumb considering those who do that are pretty much only foreigners to whom the law does n't apply ? 
  esti 's strategy of `` i do not exist , move along '' seems to be working quite fine as of now , 
  hmm belarus is indeed pretty free of those , but russia ? 
  not so much imo,

  it 's not a thing here . 
  i do n't think if a `` larger car dealerships '' is even a thing here . 
  there are some markets where many dealers/private come ( mostly for used cars ) , but not a one dealer having a big place like that . 
  when you buy a new car the dealer has few exposition models and mayby few for test drives , you pick a car and it 's delivered/you pick it up few days later . 
  only flags at the dealers are either the car brand or some car stuff brand, 
  or a big brothel, 
  especially murlas like [ these ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/showuserreviews-g274725-d3836175-r214242915-murale_gdansk_zaspa-gdansk_pomerania_province_northern_poland.html#photos ) ( murals in the zaspa district of gda\u0144sk ) or [ in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkl2rzykr3u ) that are even ordered by the city or housing co-ops, 
  quite a lot ( a lot is what is on your picture ) - varies heavily on districts . 
  my impression is that it 's usually quite old sprays , i do n't think it 's as popular form of vandalism as it used to judging from how fast ( or rather slow ) new buildings/restored ones get tagged - it 's still a thing , but on far lesser scale . 
  from the content side of things most are `` just tags '' , next would be football clubs things , which sometimes goes to acab/wp/antisemitic sprays and `` fuck the police '' . 
  some are quite hilarious , when instead of standard `` fuck this club , our club rlz '' there 's insult stylised for kindergarten banter like `` x club makes tea from after-boiling-sousage water '' , `` xclub drives [ tico ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/daewoo_tico_vl.jpg ) or [ multipla ] ( http://www.blogomotive.home.pl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2zd-005-multipla.jpg ) , `` x clubs drinks alcohol-free beer '' or `` x club listens to pop music !

  what year is that ? 
  poland has a possitive current account ( +620 mln eur as for xi 2015 ; source : [ bankier.pl ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/gospodarka/wskazniki-makroekonomiczne/saldo-rachunku-biezacego-pol ) that gets numbers from national bank of poland ), 
   it 's all cause-and-effect is what i 'm getting at . 
  and its true , but completly offtopic  that does n't influence ukrainian perception ? 
  yes , but it seems not much, 
   why else would the brits send troops to poland and the baltics ? 
  to secure nato eastern flank and deture russia from thinking about moving into baltics . 
  the goal is not to help ukraine  after ukraine crisis , poland and the baltics were up in arms , asking for nato protection . 
  uk was one of the countries to respond . 
  as before how is it supposed to influence ukrainian perception ? 
  what the hell are you talking about - discussion is about lack of british foreign policy thowards ukraine and you go about british relation with poland and baltics, 
  green - possitive view red - negative view missing - undecided/neutral i thought it 's rather self explanatory,

  when it comes to memes cleaning toilets wins, 
   `` mudslims '' i guess `` browns '' is more accurate translatoin of `` ciapaci '', 
  welcome to extremism where logic is thrown out of the window, 
   parties like pis are shitty for homosexuals and non-catholic/religious people not really . 
  there 's no special benefits for being catholic or problems if you are not . 
  ( unless you get offended by things like cross hanging in the parlament ) . 
  we are talking about european country , not some kind of islamic theocracy . 
  even with pis in charge we are below level of religious rediculness that happens in us . 
  also i would like to add i 'm anti-pis and on liberal side of worldview , but i do n't like when people overdemonise/overprise and strawman the shit out of one side, 
   i disagree on your points you disagree with facts ? 
   i still ca n't see why a very conservative party will be the light of europe , which was my main point . 
  not that very conservative , but may be for eu standards . 
  as long as conservative party makes reasonable decisions ( still waiting for pis to make some ) it can be possitive . 
  there 's nothing inharetly bad with being conservative ( unless you mean extreme form of it ), 
  there 's no wanting of banning of immigration , but calling for following the law in reasonable way  the first one i said it because your comment about multiculturalism , nothing else a lie though there 's no controling the press , but change of control model over state owned channels the homosexuality promotion is limited to gov money and part about catholicsm is pretty true . 
  pretty big - first two ones are straight out lies, 
  a `` cleaning job ''  i guess it went over some heads : `` to clean '' can have two meanings : ( 1 ) normal one : to remove the dirt from something and ( 2 ) to assasinate/kill . 
  polan is steorotypically known for people emigrating to clean toilets . 
  swaping the meaning you got the sittuation from article , hence the joke - polan still goes west for cleaning jobs , but now it 's different kind of cleaning . 
   if poland wants to ban immigration , control the press and ban `` homosexuality promotion '' and focus on catholicism big strawman , but whatever, 
  hurr durr polan defending sweden , 
  and by `` european values '' they literally meant `` overzealous political correctness and homogender multiculti '', 
  some obviously , especially the church of kaczy\u0144ski followers , 
   or the corrupt police in poland and the rest of eastern europe does n't bother to investigate this part still counts as reported though . 
  difference in reporting crimes may be a thing , but then again - anecdotal experiences of people coming from germany or netherlands are really worrying compared to what was ~ 10-15 years ago, 
  does gov need to implement this in some fixed timeframe or is it just an expensive poll ?
