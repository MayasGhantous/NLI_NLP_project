  it 's one of the main thing from the election campaign - `` 500 pln for each child '' to boost our birth rate .

  the 3 new ones in warsaw get ton of possitive feedback : - [ muzeum powstania warszawskiego ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising_museum ) ( warsaw uprising museum ) - [ muzeum fryderyka chopina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fryderyk_chopin_museum ) ( fryderyk chopin museum ) - [ muzeum historii \u017byd\u00f3w polskich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polin_museum_of_the_history_of_polish_jews ) ( polin museum of the history of polish jews ), 
  but the blocks , train station ... aside from the lake my hotel was at , my group was like `` wtf , what a shithole '', 
  you can say that you watch it and do n't get weird looks , so it counts i guess , 
  i was in tychy in november and god was it a depressing place to live in ( the weather made it only worse ), 
  wa\u0142brzych at least has some cool sights like the castle hill or marketsquare . 
  you mean to watch the voting circlejerk, 
  definitly no i will mayby look up what ads were played during it, 
  so you are asking if the steorotypes has changed , not about news or sympathy thowards americans . 
  and for that answer is no . 
  steorotypes take shit ton of time or a massive event to change, 
  that 's new , which one exactly ? 
  welcome into club ; ), 
  there 's a thing called school where you learn about stuff . 
  after basic education you should know that people in eg .

  nope, 
  there 's nothing negative shown here i do n't recommand you looking through kids stuff then - it 's full of such steorotypes , especially the geography part, 
  it 's just making an issue out of something completley innocent . 
  a `` let 's remove rainbow from kindergarten couse it promotes homosexuality among children '' kind of thing . 
  oversensitive people overthinking stuff, 
  like copypasted from kids books, 
  did n't john paul ii make the meeting with orthodox church , protestant branches , jews and muslims a standard thing ? 
  how is this meeting in any way historic ? 
  there 's a reason why you peel the oranges from the skin ... 
  here you can get various fillings - chocolate , toffee , advocaat , various fruit jams and creams same goes for toppings : pudered sugar , icing , toffee with nuts , chocolate etc, 
  some complaints on the occasion : there 's special place in hell for bakers that do n't fill the doughnut or give just a little accent . 
  and grated orange skin topping was made by the devil himself, 
  why english not eg . 
  german , french or spanish ? 
  i did n't say it should n't be here, 
  there 's subs for each country / r/italy, 
  when you make fun of everyone it 's ok, 
  no , why ?

  they say polan will be stronk and cool, 
   mao and stalin were the equivalent of hitler x10 that depends who you ask , eg . 
  russians see stalin more like a hero who `` like every great leader had done some bad things '', 
  actually we got space program in form of esa and polish space agency , nothing super special , but always,

  they picked a wrong map or what ? 
   stay relevant and not just pieces on a chessboard we are relevant ? 
  in what context ? 
  just go as turist or go to live there ? 
  - i imagine there will be a big difference, 
  puting producers is bit of a stretch, 
  reddit for trivia and others from various finances portals or my forex feed, 
  as for us it was a pretty `` short '' period where there was nearly constant war during our golden age . 
  conflicts with russia and persians got much longer history, 
  you can always add napoleonic wars instead ; ), 
  the notion was that po ( previous party ) has done nothing for the country and what 's worse sold us to germany , so there is pis - the chosen ones that will fix poland and free us from foreign powers, 
  does n't sound so good, 
  as for relations from few in person talks ( those came to poland couse they had polish roots and used that perk to go west ) and reddit comments i got an impression that many belarusians see poland similar to how we see russia - an untrustful state that only waits for an opportunity to grab the land , which is pretty sad, 
  the studio parts and introductions were very easy , but problems started to pile up rapidly during the segments  for decades poland and ukraine could have very well been located on the other sides of the globe . 
  now they seem to be rediscovering each other only belarus left now , which nearly a blank spot at eastern border . 
  i got an impression that it was always omitted when doing country presentations like that during my whole school time , which is more strange considering i lived in the voivodeship bordering it, 
  i believe it would be pretty similar for us , plus additionally - sweden ( if we count mutiple stages separately like in 30years war - ~ 10 wars ) , - for turks it 's exclusively vs ottoman empire ( ~ 8wars ) - and lot of small wars vs czechs ( bohemia ) mostly in 10-12th century - and surprisingly few wars vs germany - well it 's a bit hard to count considering various german countires/kingdoms germany was in and eg . 
  do you count teutonic and livonian order as germany ? 
  [ list of wars involving poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_poland ), 
  i wonder what kind of propaganda would be it have to be to make people think saddam was worse than a war front and isis ... 
  evil americans also created deserts in the middle east , before it looks like europe with fields and forests, 
  it 's from there : ), 
   life with sadam was good , but bad usa came and destroyed everything compared to what was after the invasion it 's pretty true,

   because they just signed some new surveillance law , so no privacy we just cought up to european standards : ^ ), 
  direction i had in mind tier1 : standard eu or schengen tier2 : eurozone tier3 : possible federal the higher the tier the more integrated it is, 
  eurozone is kind of like the 2nd tier eu, 
  sorry , but how old are you ? 
  you questions and answers are very vague for an adult who is about to move to another country, 
  and what exactly are you looking for ? 
  it was a wink to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zqwlt/polands_new_government_dislikes_critical_media/ ), 
  that depends on the angle you are looking from, 
  switzerland kind of shows itself since it 's surrounded by eu members, 
  just rotate your screen and it will be k, 
  we also netherlands now, 
  so now it 's `` we '' again when you want to anschluss your neighbour ?

  that 's pretty impressive .

  tl ; dr : previously police and secret service had to file a formal request what exactly they want and why ( needing a note from judges iirc ) asking the internet provider . 
  now they can just go to internet service providers and look the data they want ( they get audited from time to time to check if what they do is ok ) .
