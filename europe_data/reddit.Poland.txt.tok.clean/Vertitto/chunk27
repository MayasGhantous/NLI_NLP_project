  is it made by the same guy who made [ i 'm a russian occupant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65swzhabes ) , similar style that one had more sense though, 
   even so it 's performing much better than any western nation . 
  you could at least look at charts ( year ) : dax ( germany ) : -9.72 % cac40 ( france ) : -6.22 % omxs ( sweden ) : -14.39 % ftse250 ( uk ) : -0.02 % bet ( romania ) : -10.24 % bux ( hungary ) : +43.43 % ( wow ) px ( czech ) : -4.26 % sax ( slovakia ) : +35.08 % ( wow ) sofix ( bulgaria ) : -10.72 % s&p 500 ( us ) : -5.43 % nasdaq 100 ( us ) : +1.10 % and polish wig20 : -24.90 %, 
   `` we do n't want vegans and cyclists '' that one was a just failed attempt at a joke very conservative mayby , but ultra is way to big of a word for what pis represents, 
  we are bunch of sneaky bastards, 
   new ** ultra-conservative ** government top kek, 
   `` strange '' idea of their nationality was a nationality even a thing ? 
  most % per sesssion or most per week ? 
  it 's also a thing in us and canada and pretty much any place with real winter, 
  i might word last sentence badly . 
  what i mean is that people want the relationship between the countries to be close and decisive and treat the allience as if it was like that , but in reality the allience is nearly non existent, 
   v4 the single issue alliance , where all other matters are irrelevant . 
  do n't pretend it 's a big thing that people want it to be, 
  and moodys today ( or gave a yellow card to be more precise ) they take future into account , not only past results, 
   do erasmus students on exchange in other countries interact with the native students ? 
  from my expirience erasmus students hang out pretty much only with other erasmus students and mentors from host countries . 
  the interaction with native students is very limited, 
  hopefull not as a heroic act to defend against evil homogender, 
  it was on front page some time ago https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42ap7r/polish_minister_of_environments_cancels_a_series/, 
  it was announced long time ago ( november 16 , 2009 , was planned to be operational in 2011 , but got delayed [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian%e2%80%93polish%e2%80%93ukrainian_brigade ) ) . 
  i did n't believe it would materialise  the three countries signed an agreement in september 2014 to form the so-called ** litpolukrbrig brigade ** seriously ? 
  they could n't make a better name ? 
  anyone knows how such projects fit into nato ? 
  white ( especially after it darkens after few days ) would match the surrounding much more than what we got now imo, 
  i wonder - would you like it to be cleaned to look like [ right after being built ] ( http://www.mojeurlopy.pl/upload/object/1350/images/463116b3883a862707b1e29733da61e1.jpg ) or keep it as it is ? 
  looks pretty sci-fi, 
   i wonder what you think of the amazingly dull and gray apartment blocks all over the former eastern bloc ? 
  dunno for you , but we made them into colorful rainbow ( no gender glitter though ) commie blocks like [ here ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/21/c3/ed/z15581985q,wielka-plyta.jpg ), 
  there 's humiliating team games in jeux sans fronti\u00e8res , russian awesome [ tank biathlon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2owokekghxu ) and we got into a boring eurovision ... 
  they had czechoslovakia and hunagry , but not poland ? 
  ohhh : (, 
   the degree of self sufficiency for main products is still close to 100 % . 
   overall , what we are witnessing is the potential for a more cohesive survival plan to emerge for the much maligned small family farms of poland looks quite the opposite, 
  i wanted to say that they could emigrate to poland , but then again our rising right is not found of jews either ( nowhere near antisemitism seen among muslims , but still ), 
   people who were born and raised in communism , so people easier to manipulate . 
  it 's funny when you can find people claiming exact opposite on this matter / edit : [ from 2days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/427ypv/most_czechs_dont_want_refugees/cz8d4zd )  the problem with czech republic and with postcommunistic countries in general is that the generations remembering communistic media with all their lies are still very much alive and active and thus czechs , poles , slovakians , hungarians and other former socialistic nations are significantly less prone to be cheated by media than their western friends . 
  by gaivs_marivs ( the one that got burthurt on / r/poland for being downvoted today ), 
  then you are either really dumb or ignorant about europe, 
  yes , i can access it if it had been under a paywall you just had to copy-paste the article to the comment, 
  polan to poor for drugs, 
  the beef i got with many outlets that popped out recently is that many of them claim to be objective , neutral and show `` how tv lies '' while using fake , outdated materials and trying to discredit anything from tv by showing single frames banking on their audience not checking things up, 
  they ( tvn ) does that for both sides though . 
  goals behind the creating eu ( a peaceful , united and prosperous europe ) : - no wars between members ( \u2713 ) - single market ( \u2713 ) - prosperous region ( \u2713 ) ( with differences between regions , but in world scale very high ) - united ( ? ), 
  balance is pretty good if you ask me, 
   the problem in poland is that public media and most private media are saying exactly the same lol , no  what you call ` bullshit ' reveals that those crowds were actually a result of skilled camera work like [ here ] ( https://www.imageupload.co.uk/images/2015/12/12/12360196_755962771214205_4316456402322391526_n.jpg ), 
  only [ palant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palant ) comes to my mind , it 's a kids game and does n't have any professional aspect to it though, 
  no idea, 
  omg how many times can it be said that migrants were n't nearly a thing during elections, 
  you know what 's really scarry ? 
  people were expecting shit like this to heppen , but came to conclusion that it 's a lesser evil . 
  you are already a lost case . 
  you are so deeply surrounded by gender that you can not see it, 
  one does not exclude other - foreign powers impose gender on polan, 
  your post is pretty pointless without a flair or mentioning where are you from, 
  in case of poland many people just pick one outlet and sticks to it religiously . 
  many young people on the other hand outright disregard tv completely and meanwhile believe any bullshit that gets posted on the internet . 
  non of this is behaviour is resistant to media manipulation . 
  polish society lacks culture of fact checking, 
  i would be really surpised if that was true, 
  - [ warsaw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr4zof_jcr4 ) - [ krak\u00f3w ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zudgycndtjw ) - [ gda\u0144sk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvknnzurjsi ) - [ pozna\u0144 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3ygrr0nne4 ) - [ wroc\u0142aw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dekhclpr-1w ) - [ toru\u0144 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhpztg0d2jw ) - [ zakopane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_i0oitea20 ), 
  what 's even better the tower will be the hq of deloitte - the sauron of corpo, 
  it 's not that bright [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-n17mhnocy ) also some info about the building : it 's still in under construction , planned to be finished somwhere in 1q of 2016 ; total hight : 195 m . so far most of the floors ( 1/3 ) will be taken by deloitte and some by allegro group ( company behind allegro.pl , polish version of ebay , and few other portals ), 
  as for their ( us news & world report ) over all best country ranking it 's pretty surprising china and india is so high ( # 17 , # 22 ) come on there are countries like india , vietnam , egypt , tunisia , kazakhstan , iran , ukraine , but no polan ? 
  it 's really sad [ full list ] ( http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/overall-full-list ), 
  as soon as putin dies - then ukraine and belarus will use the window and join us !, 
  [ buahahha ] ( https://youtu.be/0erd3glvxl8?t=8s ), 
  there are many things that can be put as a legit reason ( i alone could add few to the ones they mentioned ) . 
  the beef is about the reasons that had been put upfront in the articles regarding the downgrade, 
  nothing surprising considering what happend after soviet union fell ... also [ oleg gazmanov - made in the ussr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qnzp27pwxq ) ( [ lyrics ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/sdelan-v-sssr-%d1%81%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%bd-%d0%b2-%d1%81%d1%81%d1%81%d1%80-made-ussr.html ) , cool song btw ), 
  i hope they ( agencies ) are awere that ceo of national bank along with monetary policy council members are appointed by the sejm , senate and president and the precedent in this case would be changing their main task ( aka keeping inflation in check ), 
  thx, 
  yes ofc political situatuation is very important , noone is denying that , but not the constitiuonal court & media changes felix winnekens highlighted ( i base on articles from reuters , financial times , can not find his full statement ) . 
  they could have picked anything - possibility of central bank 's policy change , plans for fusions among public companies , plans for spending etc , but they picked most ridiculous thing they could as if all they did was google poland and insert first popular entry they noticed, 
  meanwhile polan won vs france ( 25:31 ) topping the group a ( poland , france , macedonia and serbia ) with 6 points, 
  yes , from a - stable to bbb + negative, 
   `` we feel like it '' was the exact reason given there pretty much yes ( especailly for such big downgrade ) - as the main reason stated constitiuonal court & media changes , which is nearly completly irrevelant from economic point of view . 
   i 'm surprised poland is n't a rated considering the baltic states and slovenia/slovakia are . 
  that 's what the drama is about . 
  and most hilarious thing is that the reason for the downgrade is not based on any ecomical data , but simply `` couse we feel like it '' . 
  [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4141eg/sp_cuts_rating_on_polands_foreign_currency_rating/ ) about it, 
  can a country legitimately sue a political official for spreading nonsense like that ? 
  we got bbb + with negative tendency to be precise, 
  as for rebuilding - the old town is not really old as it has been reconstructed after ww2 from photos and old plans . 
  ww2 left the city in similar state of that of nagasaki and hieroshima , it was nearly completely grinded to the ground ( [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr5ugi7mil4 ) ) . 
  before the war it was similar to prague , [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zossrlqh5i ) with old photos . 
  [ americanized shoot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b06owwp.jpg ) [ europeanized shoot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yn9koil.jpg ) [ russified shoot ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/warsaw-pilsudski-square-1900s.jpg ) [ old town ] ( http://img.property-krakow.com/qlinksen/5/5947692bb7763879f57286ddca4366be.jpg ) [ heli shoots from tour de pologne 2015 ] ( https://youtu.be/t-lxwwhmwho?t=17m5s ) ( from t = 17m5s are the best sequences ), 
  they just want to be unique in some , in reality just they can not into alphabet, 
  transnistria in moldova is best place ever, 
  let 's face it - had we counted living dialects the map would be in one colour . 
  aside from some remote villages or culture centers you wo n't hear them in everyday speach , especially among young people . 
   right wingers who call for boycott on german products did i miss something ? 
  on the other hand also italy and s.korea, 
  you mean more normal ? 
  it 's not aimed at you , just the expirience i have with people around me ( mostly via fb feed from people i used go to school with ), 
  they made him learn english  also my anecdotal expirience : the people who cry about `` losing culture '' most , are usually those who do n't know their culture in the first place ( did n't bother to read books for polish lessons , considered history to be waste of time , got problems with constucting a proper sentence in polish etc ), 
  as for best place in poland i would pick 3city over pozna\u0144, 
  the mentioned centennial hall and szczytnicki park is awesome, 
   in no way is freedom of speech suddenly threatened i agree, 
  so we will count after each election how many media outlets are for and against gov and rewrite the law each time ? 
  without the changes pis would be in the same possiton of control , but without all the drama and possible future problems,
