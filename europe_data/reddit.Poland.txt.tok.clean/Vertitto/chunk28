  i agree that it 's completly overblown in western media , but there 's some level of worring things in the pis changes  the previously ruling party did the same and appointed their own people you miss the point . 
  pis changed the formula of setting people into public media , which is the problem . 
  not the fact that their representative is on top . 
  previous model consisted with many stages and contests working as a buffor . 
  now pis get rid of that buffer they are making changes , they themselvs would be against had anyone else been implementing them . 
  or get the gun as collectable item, 
  ah the cultural gems one of polish gems in response - [ bracia figo fagot - hot dog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohjugeii4uq ) ( also nsfw ), 
  it 's not really close to `` l '' letter , it represents sound of w in `` wow '' you can write some words with it into google translator and make it speak for you in polish : \u0141otwa , bu\u0142garia , \u0141adny , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , \u0141okie\u0107 , s\u0142owo , [ polish alphabet vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s-vmd_pbks ), 
  couse [ finland does n't really exist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2qjohv/what_did_your_parents_show_you_to_do_that_you/cn6pn30 ), 
  a not impressive one - kanada, 
  they could have used `` ch '' just like for other countries like that eg . 
  chechnya and lone h or k at the end - cheh/chek, 
  iirc during russian empire ( ? ), 
  times russians implemented lot of loan words from western languages to be cooler, 
  palestine getting along with israel is more likely  also getting balkans together to the mix ? 
  hahahaha, 
  it already got posted https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41845h/country_names_in_finnish/, 
  do n't like it ? 
   people ** will say ** holenderski in most cases, 
   niderlandzki - dutch ( language ) people will say holenderski in most cases, 
  spelling mistake : liechtenstein * and cza ** r ** nog\u00f3ra * made by u/zbrojny120 if you wonder how things are pronounced use google translator for triggered dutch people - we got an alternative : niderlandy , but it ' very rarely used other alternatives ( very rarely used ) that come to my mind : hungarian ( man ) : w\u0119gier - madziar italy : w\u0142ochy - italia germany : niemcy - germania greece : grecja - hellada ( but mostly when speaking about ancient greece ) switzerland : szwajcaria - helvetia ( nearly never many people wo n't know what you are talking about , more of fency thing when you want to sound smart ) breakdown of british : - england : anglia - wales : walia - scotland : szkocja - n.irleand : irlandia p\u00f3\u0142nocna, 
  i just hope you are awere how dumb your statement is, 
  but the formula is the same : white in some language and russia ( or rus if they want to be correct ), 
   hile other languages have some form of `` belarus '' which nearly the same thing . 
  bela = white, 
  well that 's awkward also related : [ rawr !, 
   international deals supersede local laws only directives do and even then you have lot of time to make it work in your country 's law, 
  read comments on the internet and among people . 
  while pis will be probably left with only it 's core electorate , the country will be polarised even more, 
  ven\u00e4j\u00e4 in finnish, 
  with random people - it 's weird and rather not ok it 's usually done with people you are close with ( usually family or cousins , but also sometimes on public official occasions ) on formal/semiformal occasions like weddings or christmas . 
  it 's usually 3 cheek kisses ( all sex mixes ) or one kiss on hand . 
  ( only on formal occasions , man kisses woman - important thing woman starts by giving her hand knuckles up ; nowdays it 's a vanishing thing ) lot of girls that are friends with each other also great by 3 kisses, 
  english speaker may read those two in the same way, 
  you are awere than czech/slovak letters e and i are not pronounced like in english ? 
  i guess they are one of the few countires that got so little variation in other languages - even baltics , fins and hungarians call then like everyone else, 
   as a direct effect of their `` governing '' i would say more couse of their horrible pr during both elections . 
  for the most time they had big support . 
  it 's during the 2nd part of presidential elections they started losing support massively, 
  i do n't think we got fruit one like this . 
  at least it does n't pop into my mind now . 
  mayby someone posts it soon we got a saying `` co ma piernik do wiatraka ? '', 
  = `` what has gingerbread to do with a windmill ? '', 
  that has the same role, 
   razem/zjednoczona lewica - full leftard mode is there something specific or just `` i hate left by definition ''  nowoczesna - po 2.0 . in term of many policies yes , in terms of people not even close i have hard time seeing in what configuration pis would be a `` lesser evil '' , mayby among right leaning parties, 
  are you aware there are more parties than po nad pis ? 
   you ca n't close a sea border , so unless the goal is to turn greece into a gigantic refugee camp actualy you can if only you want . 
  it would impact countries like turkey or libya instead and result in lot of deaths ( or mayby less in the long run as people would know that they will get shipped back ) on the sea though, 
  my beef with your previous post is that it 's not regarding refugees . 
  there are ton of people in media and internet who just talk about different things as if they were the same ( from both side of the spectrum , some do it intentionally , some from ignorance ) eg . 
  equating refugees with migrants , saying that quotas are for all migrants coming to eu , etc. 
  achieving only confusion among most readers, 
  people wanting to leave russia and get to ue often go by refugee route claiming they are being prosecuted for political reasons , some of them are granted asylum . 
  and most are probably just chechens, 
  again and again . 
  apples and oranges . 
  do n't confuse people by droping random numbers when talking about refugees , use refugees numbers not total foreigner numbers . 
  so far in 2015 only 273 out of 4.000 applicants ( and that 's total , not only ukrainains , but also rusians , chechens , georgians , tajiks and syrians , egyptians or iraquis ) were granted assylum in poland [ source , in polish though ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/artykul/1476518,ponad-4-tys-osob-zlozylo-w-polsce-wniosek-o-status-uchodzcy-wiekszosc-odrzucono ) . 
  some numbers from the article : requests : - 2.100 russians - 1.300 ukrainians - 208 - georgians - 103 - tajiks - 62 - syrians some ukrainians may be from war regions and just did n't bother to go by the asylum route and chose standard visa instead , but then they are not considered refugees by law, 
  from my expirience this picture may as well be taken in poland  someone always breathes down my neck , i feel threatened , violated . 
  never expirienced that, 
   what is special about your country 's standard of beauty ? 
  i do n't think there 's much of a difference in this respect in europe, 
  more than reliable , they were fixable unlike todays cars . 
  if something failed , you could quite easly fix it yourself, 
  my expirience with them is exactly opposite ( \u0141om\u017ca ) - most of adults could n't get a stable job becouse they did n't knew the lang well/had no qualifications and it was nearly impossible to legaly hire them , they all lived in one neighbourhood they were provided with , their kids had problems in school ( bad grades , skipping classes , petty crimes , fights etc ) . 
  i would n't call that a success . 
  i can not speak for present time as i was n't in that part of town for around 10 years . 
  my parents after hearing that gov will take refugees couse we had good expirience with chechens were laughing, 
  a shitpost then, 
  i 'm missing something is there something important going on that i forgot about ? 
  well he 's from a party where people say things like that being serious . 
  it 's pretty hard to draw a line when they are joking, 
  i will give you a mindblowing pice of info - the plans are about refugees , not migrants , which are small % of the migrants . 
  it 's a problem for destination/transit countries like spain , italy , greece , germany , france or sweden who will have to deal with the total number of migrants . 
  for us only those who get qualified as refugees matter who are n't that many, 
   that said , the current anti-germany stance might actually end up beneficial to poland now , as with stance like this there 's no way the rulling party will accept any more middle eastern and african immigrants beyond the couple thousand previous goverment agreed to take in . 
  for this particular crisis the radical law and justice might actually be the best choice for poland . 
  concentrating on minor , bullshit problems rather than real ones ... as if there was a difference in taking 1000 , 4000 or 7000 refugees . 
  those numbers are nothing and people are acting as if the numbers went in milions would n't it be more resonable on focusing on clarity and fairnes of law , public finances , education , healthcare itp when judging the party 's impact on country ? 
  / edit : i remind people that this is about refugees in countries like poland , baltics , czech or slovakia , not spain , italy , greece , germany , france or sweden , where the problem is entirely different, 
  putin ? 
  i hope they will at least put qualified people as ceo and members of monetary policy council that will have balls to say no to dumb ideas , not some dimwit yes-puppets, 
  i wonder about pubs . 
  from my personal expirience they seem to keep as they did or even more got better and many of my friends at uni switched from clubs in favour of pubs, 
  nice but i guess it 's more suited for / r/poland or / r/polska, 
  wow poland is among the cool countries ; ) even better than italy looking into it - we were even bit higher in 2011, 
  if you look close enough it 's already 70 % !, 
  if westerners wo n't change muslims will account for staggering 5 % of eu population ( ! ), 
  and non muslims will become a minority , 
  taking averages for salaries is wrong . 
  even in highschool it was taught that to present salaries you should use medians as the main tool . 
  ah it blanked out  < it was graph from [ this site ] ( http://www.reinisfischer.com/ukraine-vs-poland-gdp-1990-2012 ), 
  post ww2 until transformation ukraine was richer than poland ( comparable population that also had to go through the transformation process ) though , which is why i made that comparison, 
  apf sorry , fixed, 
  having year of swedish at uni i have hard time distinguishing swedish from norwegian . 
  my friend after erasmus in turkey claimed that turkish is very similar sounding to swedish, 
  portugal did n't have comunism though what 's sadder is comparing to a country of similar size and history like [ poland ] ( http://www.reinisfischer.com/img/ukrainevspolandgdp.png ) . 
  from being a bit richer it got to be over 3 times poorer in such short ammount of time / edit : the link has blanked out , it was a graph from [ this site ] ( http://www.reinisfischer.com/ukraine-vs-poland-gdp-1990-2012 ), 
  well then western card of `` we take ton of easteuropeans '' is also valid .
