  couse it 's two completley different things . 
  it would be ok if those were number of assylum seekers/refugees from ukraine ( or whereever ) , but not numbers of ukrainians coming in total . 
  it 's the same bullshit as equating migrants with refugees, 
  yes , but it 's getting dangerously close to us levels . 
  in few years we will be like us  cologne would never happen in the usa lol europe is not only germany/france/britain, 
  and [ eu - the dank meme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbbynqzgj8o ),

  my friend ( tall blonde curly hair girl ) went to china ( it was one of the huge cities , but not the popular ones like shanghai or beijing ) and she was asked multiple times to pose for photos while being in a shoping mall in the city center, 
  are you awere you are asking people from countries high majority of which are gun free ?

  wig , mwig40 , swig80 or ncindex is a better place to look at investors mood / edit : i ' v cross out part about the currency , couse it 's a pretty ambivalent at a marker for how the economy is doing and how investors see a country via it .

  for me kopacz has more natural , friendly voice, 
  ( only how , not what they speak )  andrzej duda agree , he has decent presentation  beata szydlo quite the opposite . 
  it 's painful to listen to her - very boring , nearly monotone bumbling as if it was painful for her to open her mouth  jaroslaw kaczynski quite decent . 
  sometimes he does n't articulate words good enough though,

  best type of winter, 
  seems to be exactly the same for the whole region, 
   polish change of gov to pis is due to refugee crisis . 
  i highly doubt that, 
  i do n't think we got such song when i think more about it mayby '' [ niech \u017cyje bal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyyii6w9xaw ) '' ( 1:35 the chorus ) or '' [ bal wszystkich \u015bwi\u0119tych ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysqgfnun31e ) '' could get close to to such title or final countdown by europe for english song , but `` no such song '' is most accurate imo, 
  actually we got 6 seasons ( 4 standard everyone is familiar with and 2 extra ) : - lato ( summer ) - jesie\u0144 ( autumn ) , which we have two types : warm , colorful one called polska z\u0142ota jesie\u0144 ( polish golden autumn ) and gloomy , cold and rainy 2nd one - [ przedzimie ] ( http://variart.org/img/works/544/73446.jpg ) ( `` before winter '' - it 's where trees already lost leaves , animals fall into their winter sleep temperatures are around 0 , but there 's no snow - it 's usually november/december ) - zima ( winter ) - [ przedwio\u015bnie ] ( http://www.fotoik.pl/zdjecia/11736-20110119122138.jpg ) ( `` before spring '' - similar to przedzimie , but reversed in a way - averege temperatures are already warmer 0-5 ` c , big daily amplitudes , but there 's still some snow and ice laying around , first plants are getting green ) - wiosna ( spring ) the additional ones are cliamtic , not astronomical seasons . 
  i picked pictures that imo show them pretty well, 
  pis , along po are the establishment parties in poland, 
   pis 's decisive win in october reflects the appeal of anti-establishment parties across europe . 
  lol . 
  someone does n't have a slighest idea about he is writting, 
  for czechs - your word for autumn sounds similar to polish word for additional season between autumn and winter called `` przedzimie '' ( = `` before winter '' ), 
   removed - off topic eee , i 'm confused,
