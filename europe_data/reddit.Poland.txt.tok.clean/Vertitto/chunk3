  ( which is quite probable atm ), 
   ( zh like in zhivago ) glorious \u017b / \u017c ( z with a dot ), 
  polish one indeed has the `` walk '' = `` chodzi\u0107 '' root , but `` uchodzi\u0107 '' in english would be `` to escape '', 
  it 's like this in most of the languages presented / edit : it 's not directly from `` to run '' . 
  but what i mean is that nearly all of the words are connected with fleeing movement ( run , flee , escape etc ), 
  i would love if cyrylic/greek texts on such maps were written also using latin alphabet, 
   that 's 500 people per city i just hope not in one place . 
  i can imagine it could boil down to renting few school-like buildings , giving them some money per month couse it 's simple fast . 
  such system is very probable in poland and imo it would fail miserably, 
  i would be ok if we took even lot more , but in some sort of system eg . 
  something around what pope proposed instead of creating few ghetto-like camps , giving them some money like it was usually done with czeczens . 
  has n't it already failed in countries like spain , italy or hungary ? 
  well lot of the fault here lies in germany 's behaviour - merkel invites refugees , reinforces their overblown expectations and later pushes obligations on other countries . 
  i imagined belarusian claims to be the `` real '' lithuania is what angers them most, 
  vids like that are great to get some intro to things you would normaly never check . 
  if he keeps making vids at this rate it will take him decade to get to poland, 
  was n't so bad in poland , at least in my home region ( podlasie , eastern poland ), 
  i do n't think many people voting for kukiz were supporting his idea . 
  most voted only to vote against the two big parties, 
   nowoczesna time will tell what they are about . 
  as for now they theyseem to be down to earth and are focused on economy/enterprenourship without any ideological or populist crap , which is nice for a change . 
  if they become for entrerprenours what psl is for farmers then they are good enough for me . 
  they at least may fix the overcomplicated beaurocracy and taxation  braun nice words for a guy that is walking conspiracy theory . 
  never heard anyone seriously supporting him  kukiz imo bigger joke of politics than previous partia przyjaciol piwa ( beer lovers ' party )  korwin pretty generous chances . 
  he may have bigger chances and be treated more seriously if he paid more attention to what he says . 
  couse as for now majority of his supporters are edgy highschoolers and collage freshmen, 
  they seem to care more about making bold changes that are needed since transformation ( they are for free market economy with simple straightforeward law and administration ) they also do n't talk about bullshit minor issues like gay marrige or marihuana . 
  as for referendum i do n't take part in it ( missed reginstration time ) . 
  i was against both of referendums from the start , they both should be canceled . 
  would have voted 1 . no 2 . no 3 . yes . 
  i do n't think it will get enough attendence anyway . 
  it 's something that happens once in a blue moon - since the end of ww2 we had 6 of them , last one regarding joining eu . 
  is minsk called minsk in finnish ? 
  if no , that may be the reason, 
  yey someone mentioned poland, 
  they stop being refugees ( or assylum seekers to be exact ) at the point when they refuse help . 
  there is a line of decency and many of them have crossed it, 
  refugees seek safe zone , not top quality life standard with servants . 
  hard to call them all refugees as they even disregard help, 
  do n't be sad . 
  even countries like belgium or austria are too poor for some of those `` refugees '', 
  poland also had representatives there, 
  nearly perfect center ( -0.18 ; -1 ), 
  it 's planned by jewish reptilians , duh, 
  this kind of things happen after weird border changes - same thing in eg . 
  hungary and romania . 
  this is why i believe after war resettlements as bad as they are for families they are good in long term, 
  norway , iceland , ireland and chicago are next . 
  soon they will be announced our official cololonies, 
  probably not much since uk would probably end up in a state whitch norway is in atm - technically not in eu , but everything works as if they were, 
  south ossetia drama triggered `` russia is attacking again '' rethoric here also noone will confuse you with the american state as you are gruzja while us state is just like in english from possitives georgia also appeared on vacation map . 
  it 's not among the top destinations yet , but it certenly started to appear in talks, 
  i have hard time believing that this is how matura looks like now . 
  each teacher making different test alone creates disproportions, 
  high school math program has been reduced significally over the years.you used to have to know basic calculus , count simple matrixes etc ( basically math 101 from uni we got now ) . 
  uni profesors are crying over those reductions , especially those from tech disciplines . 
  from my education expierence since early elementary we were told that we need to be good at math and languages to get good job in the future . 
  schools i went to in general put big emphasis on sciences and foreign language while things likie various social studies were looked down upon, 
  united oblasts of northen hemisphere, 
  pretty dumb reason to support a part tbh, 
  i do n't think there 's one that can be called most prestigious , but there are few that stay at top : - sgh ( szko\u0142a g\u0142\u00f3wna handlowa / warsaw school of economics ) as name suggest - everything around economy , finances , management - uw ( uniwersytet warszawski / university of warsaw ) - all around - um ( warszawski uniwersytet medyczny / medical university of warsaw ) - as name suggest - politechnika warszawska / warsaw university of technology - hard sciencies - agh ( akademia g\u00f3rniczo-hutnicza w krakowie / agh university of science and technology ) - hard sciences , known for mining and metallurgy , back room of our one of the biggest mining company - kghm ( one of the biggest copper and silver mining companies in the world ) - uj ( uniwersytet jagiello\u0144ski in krak\u00f3w / jagiellonian university in krak\u00f3w ) - all around , one of the oldest uni in europe - um bia\u0142ystok ( uniwersytet medyczny w bia\u0142ymstoku / medical university of bialystok ) - as name suggest , is located in [ branicki palace ] ( http://www.poranny.pl/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?site=kp&amp;date=20100715&amp;category=bialystok&amp;artno=73656332&amp;ref=ar&amp;border=0&amp;maxw=666 ) - um gda\u0144sk ( gda\u0144ski uniwersytet medyczny / medical university of gda\u0144sk ) - as name suggest , known especially for surgery, 
  redirecting it to separate sub would be even better , ( like the two ukrainian crysis subs ), 
  ton of shitty threads on the same issue , few of which bring something new or of substance . 
  sub has become r/migrationcrysis, 
  as mentioned before - yes and no . 
  it has big viewer base but it 's locked in just handfull of countries , while being nonexistant everyelse on the globe . 
  it 's not as wide spread as some of the other games, 
  did n't say it is n't, 
  an anglo sport like american football , baseball or cricket that noone aside the host countries care about . 
  there are few clubs in poland , but it 's rather a hipster thing in poland most popular are in order : football , volleyball , handball , ski jumps , tenis , basketball , athletics/swimming/cycling , fighting sports ( box and mma are most watched ) , e-sports , motor sports and sailing disciplines ( i hope i did n't forget anything ) . 
  in school you play football or volleyball , sometimes hand/basketball , girls usually play volleyball or less often basketball ( or just nothing ) . 
  in elementary school kids also play `` dwa ognie/zbijaka '' or `` w palanta '' ( i would love if someone translated those as i forgot how are they called in english ) / edit : sorry cricket fans , but here ( probably rest of europe as well ) it 's not a thing . 
  most people probably could n't even describe it . 
  they will be for sale as soon as plasma blasters and hover chassis gets installed . 
  any time now, 
  it 's `` news '' from around a year ago , why rehashing it now ? 
  if it 's there 's something bluntly russian , i imagine it would be traded for something ours that they hold ( is there something like that aside from revealing some archives ? ), 
  it comes from the nature of such special trains - they were often used to carry valuable cargo ( based from interviews with historians on news channels regarding the event ) the train was hidden while eastern front was at reatret , so there 's an assumption they packed valuables not to lose them to soviets, 
  one thread on front page is not enough ? 
   and that 's despicable how ? 
  and this is why people see this threads so polarised - you asume to much - all i ' v done is corrected op 's one-dimensional view of the imigrants profile, 
   people run from war , poverty , and live endangerment that 's half of them , there are also ton of people who just look for better life, 
  i ' v always liked the style of [ animated history of belarus in 5 minutes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxlagbg9qkm ) way more, 
  that would be pretty hilarious ; ) / edit : i would love to watch `` extermist goes abroad '' series way more than the para-documentaries we got in tv atm . 
  seeing a `` whitepower '' guys go helping people in africa or a super religious person sent to culture with different religion would be great, 
  is wikipedia even usefull at uni level education aside from book sources ? 
  on what faculty ? 
  / edit : from my uni expirience ( economy/finance/accounting / statistics field ) wikipedia was pretty much useless . 
  it was pretty usefull in highschool though, 
  they need to make a baner `` 50 % off !, 
  buy now , only till end of summer '' . 
  on a serious note my portfolio expirienced -8 % drop today ; (, 
  my brother is there on [ `` dar m\u0142odzie\u017cy '' ship ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/25/1f/b8/z12066597aa,-dar-mlodziezy--pod-pelnymi-zaglami.jpg ) ( it 's one of the really big ones ), 
  russia proper ends with ural . 
  after that it 's siberia - wastland with few resource depots and `` in case of war back-up towns '' . 
  i see it in similar way as eg . 
  france or netherlands and their overseas territories . 
  imo russia is definitly european , turkey is rather doubtful and - stans are definitly not, 
   gdansk along with warsaw and krakow it 's an obvious travel pick for poland . 
  i would say gdynia and sopot .
