  what 's hateful about this comment ? 
  for european standards, 
   i like europe a lot , my whole family is european that sounds really weird and unnatural for a person who was brought up in some country in europe, 
  just looked up the link - slovenia  the second switzerland i would say luxemburg , mayby austria or norway , but never slovenia . 
  where does it come from ? 
  country ? 
  aside iceland and poland, 
   partly because of the communist years ( russian was forced , but not really learned ) , also because school teaching quality is really bad ( lot of grammar , vocabulary , but little pronunciation and actual communication ) , and also the fact that we do n't have any `` low-hanging fruit '' languages , as no other language is automatically understandable to us at all , not even `` just the main idea '' or at least the topic . 
  aside the last part ( which people usually do n't count ) it 's same here, 
  dutch propaganda, 
   reporting they knew one or more foreign languages it always cracks me up . 
  i just imagine my uncle 's claimed `` german proficiency '' - he knew : ja/nein/auto / zu teuer accompanied with hand gestures, 
  in polish law phrase `` same-sex marriage '' does n't even make sense . 
  it 's `` 4-angled-triangle '' type of problem . 
  if you think of marriage in colloquial sense ( sharing life together ) , then constitution has nothing against it . 
  you can pass a law calling same sex marrige as eg `` partnership '' and give it all the same treatement as marrige has without needing any constitunal change . 
  it would need a change only if really want the word `` marrige '' badly, 
  they are not in constitution and constitution does n't prevent changing those though / edit : why the downvotes ? 
  it only means that term `` marrige '' is reserved for opposite sex . 
  that 's all . 
  it can be introduced under any other free term . 
  unless all you care is the name , the constitution does n't ban the relationship, 
   red means a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage then it 's wrong for poland . 
  there 's no such thing in polish constitution . 
  all there is one sentence which defines marrige as men-women relationship ( which along of few other things is protected by the state ) . 
  there 's no ban of any kind . 
  quote from constitution :  `` marriage as a relationship between a woman and a man , family , motherhood and parenthood are under protection and care of polish republic '' the red here makes it seem that the law explicitly forbids homoseksual relationships , which is not the case by any measure . 
  polish law simply does n't cover them which is why grey is better option imo, 
  can someone expalin to me why `` no recognisation '' and `` marrige limmited to opposing sex '' are different ? 
  or why `` marrige limmited to opposing sex '' is on the map in the first place ? 
  atm no , mayby in future when syria/isis/kurds sorts out itself and turkey finaly decides to be either western on middleeastern, 
  fast big scale , nobrainers : possitive : - esa stuff negatives : - ukrainian crysis - migrant crysis, 
   with po judges that pis voted in themselves ... 
  in my family ( podlasie ) we eat borsch on 24th and flaki/grzybowa on 25/26, 
  the big weave is already behind us i believe , but still too many people go for studies for the sake of paper, 
  mainstream media did n't even touched that issue here ( it was burried somewhere in the trivia part of news ) . 
  it was `` one of the greatest space achivement so far '' , `` will we see asteroid mining soon ? 
  '' , `` polish scientists made parts of the lander '' kind of stories, 
  noone cares about the real saint though, 
  by overhyping it ? 
  ( 10 years ago ), 
  it 's not even close to the weird part, 
  `` 1 z 10 '' is cool though ( quality quiz show that has been running since 1994 , where wide ranged knowladge is actually necessary and award is pretty modest compared to other quiz shows , based on british [ fifteen to one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifteen_to_one ) ), 
  you seem to be new to the internets, 
  when i was little we used to do that before christmas supper on 24th `` when first star shines '' . 
  in my family it 's always at grandparents , we got pretty big family : mom has 5 siblings ( each 2-3 kids , so lot of people ) and when from father 's side family is smaller ( some spend in other towns etc ) . 
  kids were sent to windows to look for the star , meantime some member of the family ( or neighbour ) would come dressed as santa ( you would have to sing a song or recite some rhyme to get presents ) and give presents or presents would just magically appear under the tree . 
  now when kdis grew up and half of them got their own families , christmas are much `` smaller '', 
  like the one in [ bigbangtheory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmr1qrgebv4 ) ? 
  polish ? 
  you are of polish decent or just for lols ? 
  i believe it 's the case nearly anywhere . 
  you have to be very lucky to both get a good teacher and a group that actualy wants to learn the lang instead of just passing it, 
  ugly women is as big german steorotype here as their ordnung, 
  in my case : - polish from start obviously ( polish subject starts with writting , spelling , reading , grammar and later it fades out and gets more and more focused on literature/culture studies ) - english since primary - german ( 6 years : 3 of mid school and 3 in high school ) - swedish ( 1,5 years at uni couse i like how it sounds ; it was a mistake couse now i do n't know either german or swedish well enough and they blended together in my head ) - planing to sign up for some egzotic lang like chinese , arabic or farsi soon in general - you start with english or less often with german - in mid school 2nd lang kick in it 's either german/english/russian / french - same thing in highchool - at uni it depends what is avaiable . 
  i had field speciallised ( finance ) english or german and you had to pick second one from : english/german/french / spanish/russian/swedish ( obviously you can not pick the same twice ), 
  you are like 3 baltics gone wrong, 
  almost like czechs, 
  most close translation would imo be '' [ congratulations ] ( implied ) on graduating '' . 
  matura is an exam at the end of highschool that is basis for university recruitment . 
   is hating on other scandinavian countries . 
  just say sweden , everyone knows it 's just sweden, 
  for me it sounds super fast with all the rolling `` r '' and `` t `` s, 
  another few german ones : two old germans on trip in poland : - you know poles are not such thieves they are said to be . 
  look here i got a precious watch and they still did n't steal it , oh there 's even an inscription engravaved on it : `` z okazji matury - warszawa , 1939r . '', 
  where do germans lay ? 
  under staliningrad . 
  why prostitutes in germany need to be imported ? 
  couse german prostitutes would have to pay extra, 
  it 's just random copypasta number posted various forums, 
  what 's more scarry the turnout is pretty high for polish standards, 
  and how many internet accounts have they orderd to shit on any critique of the gov ? 
  we sometimes do that too, 
  also common in poland , but they are going out of fashion and [ this ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=translator&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=633&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewim5yhz1_djahuhnhokhrs1dpmq_auiccgd#tbm=isch&amp;q=rolety+okienne ) can be found way more often nowdays, 
  tbh nope , but on the other hand nor should most of the migrants, 
  in poland it can happen on inter city buses , never heard in public transport, 
  they are on some calendars , but none uses them, 
  does n't work so well in 3city 's skm though , where you can be checked on each trip if you are unlucky, 
   skin colour is not a problem either that varies . 
  now due to the whole migrant drama and fearmongering that happened there has been incidents where `` brown '' people got attacked ( verbally or even physically ) . 
  it 's still rare incidents ( i think ), 
  i mostly had the migrant crysis in mind where country after country just said `` fuck it , i 'm not gon na deal with it , just let them in , they go to germany/sweden anyway '' to the migrant weave . 
  from the other side careless attitude of west also needs to change, 
  eee that 's very debatable . 
  most people i guess would consider that it was a big failure especailly from the law side they are in very shitty possitions as it 's very had to get them registered in a way so that they can work normally . 
  many end up in a legal limbo . 
  [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xvbgz/poland_is_no_country_for_new_men/ ) touches that a bit, 
  mostly what i expected , aside from :  `` schools did n't want to take in my kids ** because they 're chechens ** . 
  i finally had to beg a principal to let them in . 
  this is not a country for refugees , '' she told afp . 
  i highly doubt that was the reason ( i 'm from region where lot of chechens were settled ) . 
  being chechen has nothing do with being taken into school . 
  it 's way more likely that kids were not able to communicate in polish/english/german / french or even russian and school could n't afford a separate class to fit the needs ( especially if the group was of just few children ), 
  mayby ( i 'm not a pop radio listener ) - [ lao che - wojenka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9pkfnwc7di ) - [ dawid podsiadlo - w dobra strone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ib2c8d5eze ) - [ organek - o , matko !,

  lol , i would laugh at them, 
   57 % consider the effect of the arab spring to be negative . 
  that 's pretty small tbh . 
  i would expect to have higher numbers even in west, 
  having to pay upfront when walking into a shop would be one way , but still very dumb concept,
