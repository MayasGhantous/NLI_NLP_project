  never heard about such thing, 
  it 's not about being `` special '' , from my expirience on the internet schooling in some countries is reason for such mistakes, 
  wrong flag or to ashamed to admit to have thought that bulgaria was a part of ussr ? 
  in context of concrete ugly grey block compilation everyone is in eastern europe, 
  aside from colours now they often paint cool murals on the sides, 
  it 's old picture though . 
  now there are brand new , fency blocks in the place where the truck is ( if i 'm not mistaken ), 
  except it 's not ussr ; ), 
  [ both borders ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/curzon_line_en.svg/2000px-curzon_line_en.svg.png ) [ larger time scale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_evolution_of_poland#/media/file:border_changes_in_history_of_poland.png ) [ wiki thread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_evolution_of_poland ),

  so you assume there are countries who are deliberately working against themselves ? 
   poland has a really bad press lately , fortunatelly , ** only 10 % ** of what they are saying is true you went crazy with that estimate ; ), 
  i wonder if it 's a `` let 's meet once a year and talk about trivia '' kind of cooperation or something of substance, 
   online games where everyone hates everyone by default, 
  the `` housing shortages '' you speak of applies only to few capitals, 
  that source though ... 
  eee that 's overoptimistic - people on the internet often just confirm their bias instead of actually chcking facts, 
  new gov is making their changes by breaking one law after another outright saying they are above the law since they are doing it for the greater good and they got a mandate from the people ( as they won the elections ), 
  there 's little to worry about . 
  looks more worse than it 's actually is, 
  as if it was about losing the elections, 
  we mediterranean now ; ), 
   incomes will rise as they increase productivity . 
  this boggles me sometimes . 
  after an internship in polish shipyard and i wonder how in the hell shipyards in eg . 
  finland manage to be profitable when their working costs are multiple times higher while the work quality/infrastructure is comperable, 
  europe prepares to fight to keep britain in the eu ... each christmas ; ), 
  if they get rid of the onr flags and flares it would be great and that speach , just no thx, 
   polish , russian really ? 
  it 's hard to say couse of bias , but i thought those two ( or czech-russian ) are most different from each other in slavic langs i can pick out czech and belarusian . 
  i find it hard to separate ukrainian and russian and all balkan slavs sound nearly the same for me, 
  he 's croatian , polish is one of the most understandable lang for him, 
   apparently lithuanian sounds russian to everyone else but lithuanians accent and tempo/melody . 
  remember to take extra strong light bulbs , couse you wo n't be seeing much sun / edit i 'm not even joking btw people coming from sunny countries notice lack of sunlight pretty fast from my expirience, 
  if i had to bet i would go for hungarian, 
  you speak the melodic , soft swedish or the more danish-like version ? 
  ( had swedish in uni and that 's two types of swedish i ' v got in my mind ), 
  i picked slovenia couse it always seemed very cosy and peaceful , it 's not that bad economically either, 
   with strong support of pro-putin neonazi football hooligans you forgot about no1 story from euro2012 ? 
  considering state of ukraine 's finances atm it 's a more of a donation, 
  it 's good they are continuing po 's work on outsideeu matters . 
  at least on outside eu international realtions there 's some continuity / edit : for those unawere the trip to china is extention of poland joining the chinese version of imf ( asian infrastructure investment bank ) on 15 april ' 15 . 
  and for ukraine iirc it 's not the first loan poland is issuing to help ukraine, 
  in my case i only got stcked mostly to their kiler soundtrack, 
  songs from the vid : 1 ) dick drawing [ elektryczne gitary - wszystko chuj ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokhslprnps ) 2 ) waiting for the devil [ tadeusz wo\u017aniak - zegarmistrz \u015awiat\u0142a purpurowy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obvizjrneza ) 3 ) song for the devil [ weekend - ona ta\u0144czy dla mnie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvxg3zl_whu ) 4 ) ending [ marek grechuta - dni ktorych nie znamy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og6peolakm8 ), 
  in american english they tend to see country = nation very often, 
  [ song in question ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydxr6epiwf0 ), 
  woosh, 
  this expansion is more of meltdown pot of polish stories than actual witcher story - it feels like sienkiewicz 's trylogy fused with pan twardowski , not to give any spoilers, 
  and for w3 fans - it 's what big part of hearts of stone is based on, 
  so not to end on a bad note and misunderstandment small round up : ** jew thing ** i ' v admited i ' v added the jew part as it 's just common thing among pis eloctorate and that it was not ok from my side to do that while talking about what kaczy\u0144ski says ** court issue/marches ** i 'm not satisfied with way pis handled the mess left by po , it could have done it much calmer , without breaking the law . 
  i agree with kod that breaking law by pis is a bad and worrisome thing , ** but ** it 's nothing near being `` end of democracy '' and not bad enough to go on streets imo ** general closing words : ** while i 'm not ok with programs/ideology of many parties , it 's pis 's way of talking about people ( mostly of opposing views ) and their way of handling relations with other parties really annoys me . 
  had n't we sorted the jew thing already ? 
  that 's pretty grotesque, 
  already here https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wtov5/as_poland_lurches_to_right_many_in_europe_look_on/, 
   `` i am very agitated and depressed , '' andrzej zoll , a former president of the polish constitutional tribunal , said in an interview with gazeta wyborcza , one of the country 's leading newspapers . 
  `` twenty-five years of democratic poland is coming to an end . '' what pis does is a bit worrisome , but `` twenty-five years of democratic poland is coming to an end . '' is an overexaggeration, 
  you linked to `` in vermont , savoring craft beer ( without selfies ) '' article, 
  i 'm really surprised we got twice as much people as czechs . 
  i wonder what part of that is neighbouring countries coming for shopping , 
  i on the other hand got really hyped for georgian coast and mountains . 
   but obviously you 're not going to find such a thing fast search : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tec9l0sy-_w, 
  less and safer than in other parts of europe . 
  it exists mostly in phrases and conspiracy theories . 
  irl , well , it 's not jews in poland nad polish synagogues that need armored guards to feel safe, 
   i 've told you that supporters of every side use this or similar rhetoric it 's not about supporters , but the leaders themselves, 
  indeed , i should n't have used jews in that example , not fair to line in his electorate with him . 
   then you whine that he 's accusing people of something . 
  difference in magnitude though, 
   jews i mentioned that couse pis supporters tend to be heavily into various jewish conspiracies  rhetoric of every side is just like that and here 's where you are wrong . 
  po used something similar ( `` if not us , then pis will get to rule '' ) , but it was n't `` we ' r they only good ones , all others are bad '' . 
  razem , . n even old ones like psl or sld do n't use this construction, 
  cosue it sums up rethoric used by pis very well - many of kaczynski 's speaches are constructed in the same way : start with some good symbol ( eg . 
  pope , sylidarity etc ) , say that it was oppressed by bad symbol ( communists ) , pis is then said to be only true extention of the good symbol and since it 's the only extension all who oppose pis are communists , jews or hidden forein power that want to destroy poland, 
   they defend democracy with their fond memories of our communist generals !, 
  say that someone is even worse x , be labeled as x supporter ... 
  it 's not a quote from the march , but generalisation about the steorotypical bad pis hate speach , i thought i made it pretty clear  except that many of anti gov protestors actually consider communism or jaruzelski junta as `` better '' times . 
  lol, 
  they can not drink alcohol though , imagine that, 
  there was a post summing up voting for all the judges on / r/polska i will dig it up in the evening after i get back, 
   yes you can win the elections and have both the president and a ruling party from 1 direction but you 'll get blocked by the tk just because your opponents ( po ) picked the `` independent '' judges it misses the point a bit since pis supported those judges  the pro-pis and nationalistic marches were under-reported all tv media i ' v seen claimed pis march to be much bigger, 
  ofc, 
   i watch anti pis media media show only hate speech what 's the difference what media do you watch if it 's full broadcast of the event ? 
  funnily enough pis supporting media like trwamtv make highlights of those speaches considering them good  hate speech ( what is it again ? ), 
  i ' v said what i mean by it : `` they are not real poles , communists everywhere , pis the only rightful way '' . 
   they have the right to change the country however they want that 's not how modern democracy works  as it represents the will of majority of poles majority of voting poles * also considering people 's reasons fro voting parties rarely represent will of the people, 
   ( i 'm looking at - not only though - you , polish people . ), 
  there 's a thing in many polish minds that we ' r supposed to be on canada , austrailia , germany , norway life quality level , but it has been taken away from us . 
  it 's also really hard to hear something good about poland here , we ' r so used to hear in negatives that any data or comment saying otherwise is usually called out as propaganda . 
  micro states fuck up all kind of indicators/statistics, 
  hmm in random live spots i did n't notice anything bad yesterday , usually it was `` gov should really rethink about what they are doing '' - type of comments . 
  while today it was steorotypical bad pis hate speach `` they are not real poles , communists everywhere , pis the only rightful way '' . 
  mayby it was just coincidance that bumped on those banners ( i did n't watch lot of each march - just glanced few times at live feed to see the sizes of both marches ), 
  the rhetoric used in the march was disgusting, 
  '08 is also global crysis, 
   po clone which is lead by the guy who is paid by banks in big '' '' + pretty much anybody who is not found of pis,
