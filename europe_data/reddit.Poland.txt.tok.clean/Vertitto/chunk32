  pis would be in pretty good situation had they not be giving political ammunition at nearly each possible occasion , they do even worse job than po did before elections . 
  polish parties seem to have public and interparty relations carried out by a reterded resentful kids, 
  tl ; dr version is that pis is our little version of erdo\u011fan 's akp , 
  it 's same thing , tap is sometimes even better since it 's enhanced . 
  problems come in old buildings where due to old , rusty instalation water quality sucks . 
  people often buy bottled water though since `` my mom told me not to drink tap water without boiling '' repeated in each generation, 
  it 's not even a squat ... 
  here 's a addition to yout title : '' ( ... ) by delusional view of a western european '', 
  much better than the books books are rather averege , nothing special really , before the games it was popular only within fantasy geeks in eastern block . 
  games however get great ranking and w3 just won game of the year title and cdr the developer of the year . 
  the games are pretty much what made the books known internationally, 
   animated poland history  at about 20 minutes long hmm i never heard about it , got any link ? 
  only animated one i know is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2drxgj1nwn8 ), 
  so [ hollywood stylised `` with fire and sword '' ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3aj3hpwghe ) i 'm very cool with the idea , but i hope it wo n't be another gloomy , sad martydom picture screaming `` look !, 
  we are the greatest victims of world 's history '', 
   what about film adaptation of witcher it 's in making ( there 's nearly no info though - [ only director and budget ] ( http://www.vcpost.com/articles/106767/20151117/witcher-movie-confirmed-2017-release-date-director-tomasz-baginski-reveals.htm ) ), 
   warsaw uprising it 's enough we got [ miasto 44 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3765326/ ) . 
  the attention and hyperbolisation of it 's importance is really annoying , especially considering it 's a failed uprising that probably did more harm than good . 
  why not talk more about successful uprising or campaigns for a change ? 
  i ' v heard about it as a kid , but never seen it practised,

  it ai n't christmas without snow . 
  christmas without snow is like cosplay, 
  the town in question - grajewo is really shitty - it 's not only bad economically ( like many in that region ) , but also ugly . 
  really depressing place to live ( i was brough up in region , i drive through it few times each year ), 
  christmass lights/trees look really bad without snow, 
  one of the easiest in the world - no grammar , spelling is n't horrible , if you know german and english you pretty much know norwegian/swedish, 
  i 'm not sure but it seems to be from the start - 1997 ( fast checking i did n't see those tresholds added in some patch )  but in a global crysis that rules are one of the things that prevented the need for fast burrowing and problems that greece had . 
  as answer for 2008 crysis i think all my uni professors ( i ' v done economy for bachelors and doing finance & accounting for masters ) were pretty unanimously for introducing more caps , constraints and buffer zones for the budget and the whole financial sector . 
  ( our banking system already had more security measures than most western countries , which after the 2008 and chf crysis got tighten up even more ), 
  our constitution had 3 treshhold levels : - ~ ~ 50-55 % public debt to gdp ratio - gov can not increase next year deficit ~ ~ ** ( got lifted in 2013 ) ** - 55-60 % - gov can not let deficit to happen , wages/spending can not be increased for public sector , country can not lend money and few other caps - 60 % + - gov is additionaly obligated to introduce sanation project that needs to lower the public debt to gdp ratio , local govs can not make deficit, 
  that does n't have anything to do with eu we had them way before joining in our constitution, 
   i hope they succeed because poland needs higher deficit lol no . 
  what we need is reasonable spending . 
  we should even put more fiscal constraints into constitution to keep populism in check, 
  they ai n't dank , they are exquisite, 
  it 's a success if they attend and finish primary school . 
  hearing about having problems with getting to higher education makes me think they are talking about some other roma, 
  is n't education somewhat against roma values ? 
  ( serious question ), 
  i thought national front is right wing, 
  steorotypically in my region silesia ( especially upper one , around katowice ) it 's considered most ugly , depressing , polluted and dangerous part of poland - literally only smog and coal ; ), 
  they also had to share the pc to comment one after another, 
  [ polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ), 
  i could n't find any polls, 
  8,49 % in local elections ( 2014 ) it 's not separatist movement though . 
  most they want is a bit autonomy from the gov ( like local tax system ), 
  the thing is that there are no calls though . 
  it 's barely a thing, 
   it marks the end of the swedish empire and plc, 
   basically magnificent century from the greek side . 
  without the melodrama crap, 
  i 'm more used to hear [ the song with lyrics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umedct4bogc ), 
  i would say it 's `` unique '' as not many people got interested in it . 
  when i was a kid it was considered lame to do folk dances , i think it has changed though ( or it 's just due to the people i 'm surrounded with ) . 
  i fail to hear any melody that would even resamble anything from the anthem oo is there mayby a version with words ? 
  both pretty randomly, 
  for hungarian music look up [ liszt 's works ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xecqzafi5s ) and most know hungarian song that is very popular in poland : [ omega - gy\u00f6ngyhaj\u00fa l\u00e1ny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z0jvh6e8o0 ) , we even got few polish versions of it most known done by [ kult ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcdqj3h9xaw ), 
   i mean just from the top of my head i can list kapela ze wsi warszawa , czeremszyna , werchowyna or trebunie tutki - all essentially household names in poland . 
  aside from first one , i ' v never heard of others . 
  could n't name or recognise any of their songs though . 
  folk accents got popular recently , but it 's still rather a `` gimmick '' attached to other genres or thing locked in regional culture centers than a big thing compared to other music genres thanks for mentioning them all those artists , 
  loosely i guess since they mix various styles , cultures and instruments, 
  what is college level education supposed to be in polish system ? 
  i ' v found [ a playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddcaq_6sy8e&amp;list=plwqmhwhn1qvrgylgk_00bxnlpsjyqf8pj&amp;index=38 ) ( the song i ' v linked to is very witcher3-like ) with polish folk songs from various regions . 
  it 's not a popular kind of music in poland though . 
  ( scrooling through the playlist i do n't recognise pretty much any song ) from more modern ones i really like stuff made by ** brathanki ** ( folk-rock , they topped polish charts in early 2000s ) eg . 
  [ czerwone korale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tep-t9onubw ) , [ w kinie w lublinie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwrhdn2xusa ) , [ heniek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aihwrrmxccw ) , [ za wielkim morzem ty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myppbxyjknw ) or [ gdzie ten , kt\u00f3ry powie mi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clmjwj-y5io ) ( halina mlynkova rocks ) if that counts, 
  but what about black communist nazi homogender muslim freemason jews ? 
  is polan safe from them ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  that 's why we need nukes, 
  it hard to shake it off when west still calls us `` eastern europe '', 
  just imagine school trips going there, 
  so they will let us look at nukes ? 
  ohhhhh ; (, 
  and how is it any different from calling police ? 
   europe 's poorest country  greece lol, 
  so much that when you leave us and go to any western country , you do n't notice glaring difference . 
  [ just like in rammstein song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm ), 
  we just got `` miami vice '' on television , number one new show . 
  lol , you for serious ? 
  american culture is the western culture atm and was for last few decades, 
  i would n't be on it if v4 was n't so in-the-face lately, 
   central europe states ( hungary , poland , slovakia , czech republic ) as if those 4 were n't part of specific group that has a name, 
  from school it mostly stuck in my head that she brought new vegetables and spices to polish cuisine . 
  we also got a hill in my town named after her, 
  she reminds me of irl version of olenna tyrell from got, 
  but then again it 's not polish synagogues that need armed guards  ** how is the jewish community in poland weathering the rise of anti-semitism and anti-israel sentiment in europe ? 
  **  it has not touched poland . 
  we do not have a significant muslim population and the indigenous muslims are tatars , with whom we have a very positive relationship . 
  today it is much safer to be a jew in warsaw than in paris or budapest .
