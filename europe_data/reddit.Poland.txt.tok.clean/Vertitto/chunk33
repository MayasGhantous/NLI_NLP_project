  it 's not even cold yet, 
  astronomical winter for northern hemisphere : 22.12-21 .03 + / -1 day climat one : when average daily temperature falls below 0 ' c + usually when it starts snowing, 
  previous one : [ the hitchhiker to magadan , far east russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hurjkotpu ), 
  migration issue did n't even play a big role in the elections . 
  reverting retairement reform , various subsidiaries ( eg . 
  500pln for each kid ) , keeping dead nonprofitable industry ( coal mining ) alive by national budget and on expense of other industries ( energetics ) etc were the big thing . 
  ( and fact they are 2nd biggest option after rulling po ) - set of populist shortterm bandages without any long term plan their program is so bad that even their voters hope that was just a election bullshit and wo n't be implemented . 
  it 's not a bad thing when it 's done with sense , not just to get votes like it 's done in poland . 
  even if the `` putting its own citizens first '' is nothing more than a populist baner that has no support in real life , where decisions are made without any reason ? 
  you are just ignorant of polish political scene, 
  from kaczmarski songs like [ upadek ikara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4l49lnd5bq ) ( fell of ikarus ) , [ \u015aniadanie z bogiem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el7nz28ylpo ) ( breakfast with god ) or [ w\u0119dr\u00f3wka z cieniem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enq5ehfq3t4 ) ( jurney with a shadow ; this one is more autumny i guess ) would be better i guess, 
  go to poland and save over 2/3 on living/education costs ; ) adding your preferable areas of study would make it easier for people to suggest unis, 
  those polan borders though - modern or pre-ww2 , mayby bit of both ; ), 
  i wonder why such vessels do n't carry guns just like russian units incase such events, 
  can also work with ubite/y/a / ci , but zabity feels more natural . 
  `` zabity '' is literally english killed - as eg . 
  with gun, 
  we got same phrase in polish `` x \u015bpi jak zabity '' ( x sleeps as if he/she/it was killed ), 
  all those are more of a exception than regular trend, 
  which we do n't really really on ; ), 
  turkey has been fucking up things related to daesh conflict really badly, 
  meanwhile [ houses in poland ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@53.18045,22.0433795,3a,75y,6.45h,73.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1solbs9mcjbp8d1f6sbnrsxa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) i 'm most used to see ( go down that street , one of neighbourhoods in my hometown - a small ~ 60k people town ) . 
  we usually got cube-shaped ones ( they were build during communism times ) or more modern american-like designs, 
  as if grey blocks of flats jungle was only a communist thing ; ), 
  [ this ] ( http://weknowyourdreams.com/image.php?pic=/images/house/house-06.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/numbers_341_to_385_lordship_lane_n17.jpg ), 
  people really own houses in so densly populated countries like netherlands or belgium ? 
  it means : `` where eyes can not reach for free '' but in a more vulgar manner . 
  it 's pretty hard to find exact english equivalents , `` na krzywy ryj '' means gatecrashing and `` w pizdu/w pi\u017adziec '' means somewhere far . 
  the series are made by uni history student that goes to magadan ( eastern syberia , near kamchatka ) only with his backpack and 200pln , [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hurjkotpu ) ( has english subs ), 
  whole budged to esa !, 
  sounds like administrative change to me eg . 
  adding small towns/villages that worked as sleeping houses for people working/studying in lisbon to the lisbon itself, 
  we got 5 open mosques in poland : 2 old , wooden ones in eastern poland like one in [ kruszyniany ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_kruszynianach ) or [ bohoniki ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_bohonikach ) and 3 more : in [ warsaw ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_warszawie ) , [ pozna\u0144 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_poznaniu ) and [ gda\u0144sk ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_gda%c5%84sku ) , nothing special about them though, 
  if you are happy with political system/climate only becouse it 's nationalistic then you got serious problems in judging things or plainly dumb it 's literally like saying that some ideaology is best becouse it has a cool logo ... 
  dreamworld ; ), 
  like on the `` w pizdu na krzywy ryj '' talk with russian women : - `` russia did n't attack poland in ww2 , we entered the war when germans attacked us in brest ... '' - `` but brest was polish then ... ''  / edit : [ episode mentioned , in polish/russian though ] ( https://youtu.be/o7oibuuz7a8?t=4m46s ), 
  as far as nato goes poland is nearly only on the giving side eg . 
  - sending trops around the world - signing overpriced arms deals - supporting pretty much anything us does while we get only a pat on the back in return, 
  it 's easier , faster and more useful to give / edit ; well , mayby not faster , but certainly more effective in helping, 
  who will balance out southern slavs constant streams then ? 
  they are much worse than polish ( most of our constant streams come from double letters like sz , cz , rz , dz , d\u017a , d\u017c so it 's little missleading ), 
   try making fun of the church or catholicism on polish tv like standard sketches do on tv ? 
   - icz sounds more belarusian/ukrainian, 
   - ich if plural it 's probably polish ( aka it 's smith 's house ) , if not - then belarusian or ukrainian, 
  easy entry to weaker market, 
  you are looking only on one side of the trade though, 
  or a positive one, 
  silicon valley is tech center , not e-center, 
  it 's expansion on what ten commandments entail according to the church , a rule book of sorts, 
  catechism of the catholic church would be more accurte, 
  is there a name for catholic sharia ? 
  it 's based on [ old model ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/warszawa_203.jpg ), 
  should go both ways then, 
  not realy a sport by most definitions though it 's definitly a team discipline, 
  literally in few cities though , not country wide, 
  europe must be a really scarry place for your children then - people do n't have guns , are pretty ok with nudity , are pretty healthy and you can even buy kindersurprise in each shop, 
  you are either trolling us here or a real steorotypical redneck american, 
  `` the play is intended for really adult audience and contains sex scenes '', 
   seems foolish not to know how to defend yourself with a firearm . 
  that 's completly different thing from restricting accessibility guns, 
  what kind of hockey - ice hockey or field hockey ( or both ), 
  ice or field ? 
  as for trailer hyper ? 
  why not . 
  would be weird if they used it in the series most important thing for me was the fact they used more accurate weapons ; ), 
  most will argue that 's the main reason, 
   emergency state like in belgium . 
  ghost submarine strikes again, 
   hurling wow til such thing exists, 
  watching : volleyball or ski jumps playing : volleyball or squash/tenis/table tenis , mayby handball or basketball ( i assume things like running , swimming or cycling for fitness do n't count ), 
  come on , those are awesome, 
   the musketeers i was really hyped about it since i 'm very into fencing and thanks to [ this trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g55dcijqg3y ) ( they finally used proper rapiers & daggers for them instead of lame sport \u00e9p\u00e9es ) , but ditched it pretty fast , found it really averege , not worth the time, 
   not to mention that the same was done few months ago by the previous gov what exactly are you talking about ? 
  had it been more about the politics and war it would be really cool , unfortunatley they made it into a brazilian soap opera in cool costumes, 
  yes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhte%c5%9fem_y%c3%bczy%c4%b1l#international_broadcasts  low quality  720p ? 
  [ not in uk though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhte%c5%9fem_y%c3%bczy%c4%b1l#international_broadcasts ) ; ), 
  that 's nowhere near regular seat changes, 
  not eu , but few episodes of turkish `` muhte\u015fem y\u00fczy\u0131l '' ( it 's called `` wspania\u0142e stulecie '' = `` magnificent century '' ) and polish production , but about ukrainians emigrants in poland : `` dziewczyny ze lwowa '' ( girls from lviv ), 
  then at least people can watch some castle/palaces from belgium ; ), 
  meanwhile british weather emigrated to poland - it 's has been raining for 2 weeks ... 
  quality public spending, 
  / r/iwantout /, 
  they will make a directive that forbids fire to heppen , duh, 
  couse gypsies are like esmeralda from disney, 
  one important thing about catholic church is that it has had a bit different role in poland than in most other countries - it was more political and cultural , church was the place/institution/community that was root of most underground movements and played big role in preserving polish culture during hard times . 
  it 's where most of it 's position comes from , not the religious part . 
   volunteer firefighters i 'm talking about fulltime firefighters , not volunteers , 
   ambulance guys there was a scandal few years ago where some medical guys on purpose let people die and participated in illegal organs trade ( something like that , i do n't remember the details ) . 
  i guess that had some impact as for firefighters , they got really good pay/working hours ( they often get 2nd job ) and very early retirement age , which angers many people i guess . 
  in general those two had been always # 1 and # 2 as far as i remember, 
  yea , i did n't know how to phrase it to be short, 
  well you can half serious half jokingly say that church is 4th power next to montesquieu 's legislature , an executive , and a judiciary powers . 
  thankfully it gets pushed out as time goes, 
  and religion is not # 2, 
  source : http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/komu-ufaja-i-co-cenia-polacy-7287345.html ( polish ) ; based on gus ( polish central statistical office ) data from 1st quarter of 2015 from 14000 people aged 16 + . 
  i ' v translated all the infographics , sorry for mistakes . 
  -------------------------------- some info from the text : - women trust more in police and catholic church than men ( women : ~ 71 % , men : ~ 62 % ) - men trust more in army than women ( men : 75 % to women : 70 % ) - there 's big differences in age groups : generally the older the responder the more trust he has , biggest differences in the attitude thowards parliament , police and church - aged 25-34 : 57 % trusts in church when aged 74 + 84 % , police : 61 % and 77 % , parliament : 22 % and 41 % - trust in other polish people : 78,4 % ; family : 97,6 % ( 65,7 % definitly ) , friends : 93,4 % , workmates : 82,5 % , neighbours : 75,9 % , strangers : 39,1 % . 
  as previously the older the person the more he willing to trust other people - value of fairness also goes up with age - religion spikes up in the ranking in 65 + age group on the expense of money, 
  and that 's pretty much all the difference there is - few words ; ), 
   silesians and kashubians which are spoken pretty much only in culture centers ( and places like that ) though not live , distinctive enough eg .
