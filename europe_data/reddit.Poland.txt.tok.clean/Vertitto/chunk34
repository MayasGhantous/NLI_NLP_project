  get random group of people and tell them to introduce themselves ( name , what they do , few words about their family ) , it 's really hard to tell who comes from what region , especially when the person is young, 
  like most letters in english , 
  cool place to visit in summer time eg . 
  for blues festival or sailing on wigry lakes, 
  last time i ' v heard a major difference it was ' 90 . 
  in recent years i never been in a situation where someone was able to tell instantly where the other speaker is from . 
  sometimes it 's like `` hey dude , we know each other for a month and i ' v notice some weird quirks when you speak , where are you from again ? '' . 
  the differences are very slight and in most cases done on purpose just highlight where someone is from, 
  cutting off half of europe as usual , 
  that 's why i ' v mentioned this . 
  i 'm from \u0141om\u017ca and had to correct people multiple times, 
  from my expirience it has `` flattened '' a lot and it 's not as much distinctive/colorful as it used to be . 
  also small thing as for podlasie , couse i 'm from there - it 's only about the eastern part of it ( around bia\u0142ystok , border with belarus ) , does n't really apply for \u0141om\u017ca ( which is part of mazovia when we are speaking about regions , not podlasie/kurpie like people often think ) or suwa\u0142ki, 
  modern polish may be a bit like that . 
  it 's pretty much same across the country , there are some regional words , but accents/dialects are pretty much dead now , usually made for fun . 
  you can find them used only in small villages , by older people or during cultural events or as a turist attraction . 
  everyday speach is same everywhere ( aside from few regional words ) ~ 30 years ago you could easly tell where someone is from , but now it 's nearly impossible . 
  i would be really happy if someone more informed could say why did it change so fast ? 
  was it due to tv/internet or mayby increased regional migrations ( like for studies ) / edit : we got very rich ammount of various accents/dialects/regionalisms throught the country ( some of which are so unique that they can be considered a separate language ) , but they are not used in day to day speach any more , some put a slight shadow on the language , but that 's pretty much it . 
  had i took random people from towns i doubt many people could spot the difference , unless they used some phrases/accents on purpose, 
  the thing about it is that they think of eu just like ussr, 
  russian name for european union tells a lot how they view eu - eurosoyuz, 
  agree in principle , but his argumentation is retarded, 
  mariusz blaszczak is that kind of politician . 
  people vomit each time he appears on tv . 
  pis has few people like that . 
  get used to this , there will be a ton of yt-comment-quality statements of this tone during pis rule . 
  i think it 's general bad things not strictly what is legally called a war crime, 
  ## polan did nothing wrong , polan biggest victim !, 
  feudal system and all the medival jazz ( dunno if it counts ) - ( ? ), 
  polonisation of lithuanians , belarusians , ukrainians and smaller groups ( dunno if it counts ) - occupation of moscov which was carried out rather violently - `` standard '' war crimes - group responsiblility attitute towards ukrainians , which backfired later on - partake in partition of czechoslovakia - partake in warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia expand please, 
  what 's more annoying is that they call `` caucasian '', 
  people really think it 's 5 % in poland ? 
  i 'm very surprised . 
  could we already stop with those ? 
   eastern european porn may be in european languages ( other than english ) or may be somehow more culturally correct , giving it a commercial advantage . 
  this argument is pretty hilarious, 
  you got this reversed - they are not attacking west couse west attacks them , but just becouse of western values, 
  stockholm syndrom - people kind of get used to it . 
  especially the younger generation who never seen warsaw without it, 
  it 's just a throwaway account, 
  true for the eu borders though, 
  poland :  biotech companies and research institutes generally locate their activities in one of 6 mature biotech clusters ( warsaw , lodz , tri-city , krakow , wroclaw , poznan ) . 
   ranks  according to fdi intelligence , poland ranked 5th ( in a tie with russia ) in the world ranking of foreign biotechnological investments in 2010 , having attracted 14 such undertakings . 
  it was a huge success since a year before , in 2009 , poland managed to attract only one investment from this sector . 
  countries with higher positions in the rank are : usa ( 38 investments ) , china ( 27 ) , great britain ( 22 ) and india ( 16 ) . 
   the country also performed well in another ranking conducted by the same organisation ( 11th position ) , prepared on the basis of location and access to research centres as well as opportunities for the development of biotechnology . 
  additionally , warsaw was ranked 16th in the world and recognised as highly attractive for r&d centres ' investments , partly due to its competitive quality and costs ratio .

  dublin convention and [ european union regulations regarding eu borders ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/immigration/what-should-i-avoid/how-to-enter-the-eu/crossing-the-eu-borders_en#risksenteringillegally ) are the blunt ones, 
  [ few ] ( http://imgur.com/hj0xriw ) of those, 
   then poland should also resign from the geneva convention of refugees and why is that ? 
  it 's western countries breaking international conventions here and ostracising those who try to enforce international rules in such scenarios do n't confuse refusing quotas of illegal immigrants with refusing refuge, 
  stil # 1 , not even close, 
  depends which part and when - in first years yes - majority was lithuanian and small part was polish [ like here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hbn9op4.jpg ) , but later proportions turned to [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/rzeczpospolita2nar.png ), 
  polan goes up from 23 to 19 ( index value from 1.532 down to 1.430 ) ; ), 
  there are some who would like it , but they are in minority in poland . 
  imo the risks outweigh the potential possitives by huge margain . 
  the fewer people got access to firearms the better, 
   small talk is reasonably practiced here . 
  if by smalltalk you count a head nod for `` hello '' ; ), 
  just like any other soldier of that time, 
  every kid knows chemicals are made of elements which were invented by humans therefore they are not natural , duh, 
   `` most poles have employed ukrainian cleaning lady '' lol no, 
   a tv series is currently breaking viewer records in poland it 's a really cool series . 
  at first from tv teasers i expected it to be some cheap , dumb comedy . 
  turned out to be really good, 
  those issues are internal and posses no threat to eu ( as of now ) had it bordered iran, 
  and what threat it posses to eu if we bordered it ? 
  it 's completly irrevelant to the case, 
  what 's wrong with bordering iran ? 
  you can also see it how it looks now : [ on town 's promo vid 2014 ] ( https://youtu.be/y1l-rgxnpeu?t=15s ) and found also older : [ 1918 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dth80cu.jpg ) , [ 1931 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oryjyag.jpg ) ( bit diffrent angles though ), 
  flowers , trees , a fountain and we now got what ? 
  bricks , hurrey !, 
  there 's two of those and this one of them, 
  the weekly repost map on half of reddit 's forums, 
   russia saved you regardless how much you try and rewrite history . 
  lol , as much as hitler saved us from sovits in the early ww2, 
  ~ ~  that 's true for small countries , but in france if you do n't live in a big city like paris or lyon you do need a car . 
  and most students have one . ~ ~ ~ ~ it usually works the other way around - people in small towns got cars and do n't in bigger cars as the public transport is better in bigger towns and the traffic makes it pointless to use a car ~ ~  bank cheques they died out in poland during interwar . 
  by law in theory banks are supposed to give you a cheque book if you want , but if asked , you will be answered with `` lol , what is that ? '', 
  i had n't had it in mind specifically , but general attitude . 
  and it 's about general western countries politics , not specifically french it seems to me that it 's more of a `` asslicking front '' thowards saudis/emirates/kuwajt / bahrain , but for iran it 's reversed - they should lick our butts and be grateful that western world decided to talk with them . 
  i do n't think we have `` european rappers '' yet , it stays in countries, 
  i wonder why they do n't act the same in regard to saudis, 
  i do n't see anything wrong with it . 
  how is it different from counting how many people can enter a rescue boat before it sinks ? 
  people get triggered over anything nowdays the exercise translated :  4 refugees from syria are trying to swim to greece on a raft sized = [ size ] with displacement = [ parameter ] . 
  count how many refugees need to be pushed off the raft so that the raft can get to it 's destination if each refugee weights [ weight ], 
  lyrics :  in spring river floes moved , men made oaths ,  deserts bloom , snow charred in the sun ,  god dies on the cross , but he rises ,  chicken made of plush incubeted easter eggs ,  sheep made of sugar is not worring about the fate 's direction  at dawn the birds craze in the blue scent  so many times it has already happened ,  so why hide in love from fear ? 
   - couse behind the window spring wind jerks threes ,  ghosts and harpies wake up to work ;  do n't trust in evenings , get up and cover the curtains  ghosts and harpies , harpies and ghosts ...  -------------------------------------  in summer raw fruits bloom in sweetness ,  in work 's dance bees count on good harvest ,  the sun generously shakens his thick mane ,  on sleepy people , on lazy towns ,  prisons get deserted on national day ,  so is summer cradling us peacefully each year ,  so why we hide in silence from fear ? 
   - couse behind the window thunder is racing with lightning ,  during summer storm wodnik dances with topielica ( both of those are mythical creatures that drown people , wodnik is male version , topielica female )  in love with crime , always hungry for victims -  wodnik and topielica , topielica and wodnik ...  -------------------------------------  autumn places sunny memories in jars ,  herbs smell , bags and baskets swell ,  friends come back from long voyages ,  they wash their feet in stream of their own river . 
   under the wreath and candles the dead lull ,  forgetting what they took from life ,  poets duplicate clich\u00e9 about the autumn ,  so why are we lighting lamps from fear ? 
   - couse behind the window there 's a firce autumn downpour ,  strzygi and mirages come to windows ( strzyga is something similar to vampire , and no , it 's not the one from witcher ) ,  turn away from windows , talk in sign language -  strzygi and mirages , mirages and strzygi ...  -------------------------------------  winter groups beings as white or black ,  in winter you can warm body only with another body ,  fireplaces are blazing , chimneys blacken ,  geese fluff and warm bedding lure ,  the three kings will come to bow down to the lord ,  they will give rich gifts on coverege made of hay ,  already two thousand years this holiday returns ,  so why there 's silent memento at the table ? 
   - couze behind the window there 's blizzard , giggles and howling ,  from whom we hide in the life in vain ,  this anxiety will get us anywhere , anytime -  we remember what was ,  so we know - what will be . 
  ( i omit most of the poetic tools , it was pretty hard , sorry for mistakes ) / u/visvis updated, 
  there 's a song about 4 seasons , but it 's not sounds , but rather events and aura surrounding 4 seasons .
