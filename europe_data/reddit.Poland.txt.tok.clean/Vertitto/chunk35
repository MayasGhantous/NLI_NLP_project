   old people ~ ~ can ~ ~ only speak russian and german claim to know *, 
  couse it 's not ? 
  the argument works for some countries , while it does n't for others, 
   sabaton  best power metal lol no, 
  `` european russia '' in small letters though, 
  from mom or dad side ? 
   also , i just hope we can keep e-sports away from the betting-mafia . 
  : / about 5 years to late for that ( [ context ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/match_fixing_scandal ) - nearly killed esports in the early stage , it was a big scandal in korea ), 
  look up eg . 
  [ cs : go finals at iem katowice in 2014 nip ( sweden ) vs vp ( poland ) ] ( https://youtu.be/do4fuyuhmum?t=37m26s ) ( game 1 starts at ~ 37min ), 
  [ blizzcon finals ] ( http://www.teamliquid.net/video/streams/wcs%20stream ) ( [ brackets ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2015_wcs_global_finals ) ) are on !, 
  sorts out visa issues , state funding etc - mostly various legal stuff, 
  1/32 polish though, 
  as much as greece , italy , france , britain or germany - it 's one of the foundaments of european culture . 
  there 's no europe without the various tzars , red revolution , communism , russian music , literature or science . 
  recently due to it and eu 's behaviour russia is getting pushed out of europe, 
  i was convinced that we were the ones lagging behind everyone else just like with all financial instruments, 
  indeed, 
  first comment though . 
  in some way you just shoot yourself in a foot with your own source  it 's funny that the economist talk about car theft in germany not saying that the numbers of such crimes dropped from 105543 in the year 1993 to 19658 in the year 2011 . 
  that is a drop of 80 % !, 
  for god 's sake , the economist , that is either an example of a black propaganda against poles or you employ some undergraduate interns that write bollocks articles like this !, 
  btw i took the data from the gdv site ( gdv is a government 's office that take care of insurance companies ) ( http://www.gdv.de/2012/10/kaum-noch-anstieg-der-pkw-diebstaehle/# ) . 
  really , the economist . 
  i am disappointed . 
  worst thing is when you are removing the snow and by the time you finish there 's already a 20cm layer of fresh snow in the place you started from . 
  and to make things worse public street snow remover pushes all the snow from the road to your driveway . 
  pain of having a house with a driveway, 
  i love the duels from cpt . 
  alatriste ( mayby couse i will be staring learning rapier & dagger soon  ), 
  it 's very ignorant and wishful thing to say . 
  it 's as if you an object was thrown in your direction and first few times it turned out to be a ball . 
  there 's no reason to say the next one will also be a ball , it could as well be a stone . 
  cautious position far more reasonable, 
  the title should be : `` multiple civilians dead due to us military involvement in germany '', 
  similar thing in poland ( we do n't have the steorotype though ) can be heard from foreign students about public transport, 
  except it 's entirely different thing - different people , different time , different expectations . 
  fact of people migrating does n't make it the same thing, 
  more countries : - [ czech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xblk4arsy_o ) - [ slovakia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ebyg_7n2qs ) - [ hungary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyaztxdq5ts ) - [ romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7emhwj8bw ) - [ austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h__fp1nfam ) - [ switzerland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnz2if0pzr8 ) - [ denmark ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4iex--x9iq ) - [ sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw4akoek0gi ) - [ germany 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0_bv_gcdsq ) and [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1j1sm3qh0 ) - [ belgium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uole1hupllw ) - [ netherlands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsmvcmdpefi ) - [ frence 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmqnkwoe6c ) and [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5vugtnwaxu ), 
  usually people got coldwar image of poland ( some still think poland is like bratislava in [ the famous scene from eurotrip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0 ) ) , so they usually get very positively surprised . 
  from watching travel vlogs on yt i ' v learned that polish soap and porcelain is very famous in asia ( china , korea and japan ) , which is very surprising, 
  gf sits on your lap , duh . 
  it 's a meme not a steorotype, 
  it 's a good idea . 
  we got the big ones , but noone will sit next to a stranger, 
  or just short litva/litwa, 
  that or swedish or bohemian throne at this time we had a real opportunity set all 3 , but failed with all ; (, 
  dunno if it also happened in other countires , but up till recently people were forcefully being teached to use the right hand from early age ( when writting or using various tools ), 
  two left handers ? 
  that 's odd considerating the period, 
  different holiday , different day, 
  can someone tl ; dr me what exactly davuto\u011flu wants to change ( in few bullet points ) ? 
  they are like muslim version of polish pis or more nuts ? 
  and south america iirc, 
  few,

  pretty bullshit article, 
  the hyperbolization of everything regarding migrants is outstanding here, 
  there 's also option of privatisation just like it was done with shipyards instead of ruining energy companies, 
  the way polish minority ( leaders of it ) treats lithuanians is more problematic, 
   since duda seems very capable of being a president ... 
  unlike a certain komorowski , who just spread shame on poland . 
  komorowski at least tried to be somehow objective , i do n't think there 's any chance for that with duda, 
  would be nice you either picked a flair or write where are you from . 
  without it your answer is pretty pointless, 
  i prefer an article written by pole who is little biased rather than by outsider who has no idea what he is writing about like most articles overseas about the elections, 
   so they old government did a bad pr job , basically ? 
  mostly yes . 
  po was n't able to market what it has done so far and they got hit by one scandal recently . 
  they also made unpopular decision with rising retirement age so there 's also that  if you simply look on economical data keep in mind with things like that it 's hard to say if the good data was due to the gov or despite the gov. 
  it could be always said that gov was blocking a way bigger potential . 
  especially when no major changes were made, 
  in some way yes . 
  i personaly hate him ( hate is mayby to harsh word - i dislike his policies and the way he acts ) one important thing : his party ( pis ) has very firm eloctorate , who vote for them no mater what they do . 
  the previous rulling party ( po ) failed hard from marketing standpoint and lost presidential elections , the down spiral went on till parlamentary elections . 
  people getting annoyed by that just switched to 2nd biggest party ( pis ) giving them the majority needed . 
  so ~ half of it 's electorate does n't really like them , but did n't want to see po anymore, 
  would be clean if noone knew he was doing it, 
  it 's less shameful than clubbing baby seals, 
  russian/sovietunion wins this category hands down , it outclasses all others by huge margin there are other great anthems , but this one makes you turn up the speakers and forces you to sing like no other, 
  not much economically yes , but teachers got problems with fullfying their programs , which is ( eg . 
  math ) severly trimmed down to the point unis need to make fast additional curses for freshmen . 
  being in such situation it infuriates me that there 's so many hours dedicated to `` an imaginary subject '' , had it at least been covering proper theology , ethics or philosophy ( those require very strict , meticulous , logicbased thinking ) , but no - it 's useless teachings about saints or prayers , like wtf ? 
  you miss the point - it 's still paid by the gov as if it was a real subject, 
   if people in poland would care about reducing discrimination , yeah it would matter because a new party would be formed that has the same ideology except the gay issue . 
  politics do n't work that way . 
  you do n't create a new party just becouse you want extra one point in the program . 
  also you need to remember that lgbt state is not in terrible state atm - most of the legal problems are just inconveniences that you can just to go around , it 's not a aimed discrimination like eg . 
  in russia , where law is explicitly discriminating the group, 
  obviously , but we are talking about reasons based on which you vote for a party . 
  it 's good supplementary reason , but it should n't be the main guiding issue, 
   so because it 's not much , it 's okay to discriminate childless homosexual couples . 
  a little discrimination is okay . 
  it 's not much . 
  just a little . 
  it 's fine . 
  how about if you remove all tax breaks for all married people then ? 
  it 's social benefits for you in a nutshell , people get different benefits . 
  it 's not discriminating homo couples in particular  not because some bigots decided yeah you 're gay , you shouldnt get a right to this particular institution .
