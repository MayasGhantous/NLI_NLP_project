  yes there 's problems that should be fixed , but then again back to original point - there are far more important and pressing matters . 
  it 's like arguing over fixing a broken window in one room where there 's problems with heating , running water and electricity in the whole block, 
   what about tax breaks ? 
  depends on country , in poland it 's not that much . 
  better option is to be a mother and reginster yourself as single mother with kid and use that window till the kid is 18 iirc . 
   what happens in case of sidden death ? 
  exactly the same thing as if you were as stright unmarried couple - get your will written  what happens if there 's a will but the grandparents want the kids usually they want biological kids , not just kids i got no idea what you meant with the last two sentences, 
  the thing is it 's not the case with lgbt - they are not 2nd class citizens in light of current law . 
  people are overdemonizing the situation and mostly confuse legal side the gov is responsible for with social acceptence . 
  i just base that on one graph i recal seeing long time ago ( mayby it was 8years ago ) which showed average turnout per hour on some news panel . 
  it was after they increased the voting time till 21:00 for the first time or talked about increasing it to full 24h , something like that . 
  eh i knew it would work as retard magnet ... did you read anything i ' v wrote here ? 
  or you will keep arguing against made up argument ? 
  right next to countries like s.sudan or saudi arabia ? 
  you got really weird spectrum for lgbt rights, 
  it 's obligatory in a sense it is default in the education program and ( when i went to school ) it was counted into to grade average . 
  you got the option to have `` ethics '' or just hang out in the library , but it 's an opt-out scenario, 
  as not formal couples - same as eg . 
  relation between me and my gf but you seem to be missing the point of my post - [ reminder for you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3q6sq3/poland_conservatives_win_election/cwcshew ), 
  nothing changes after swaping words 2 . partner is able to get the child, 
  i 'm not disagreeing with the notion of gay marriage , but with it 's importance in relation to other issues when picking who to vote for . 
  it 's as recognised as any informal relationship - if you want the benefits you mentioned there 's nothing stopping you from getting those - you need to do exactly the same things my girlfriend would have to do to get my hospital info or inharite things after me, 
  more close to sweden light . 
  being gay is in no way penaltalised, 
  it 's not like lgbt people are ~ ~ a big group or ~ ~ are heavily underprivilaged . 
  it 's poland we are talking about , not an islamist state . 
  social acceptance is more problematic for this group than anything the state could do . 
  even for those groups issues i ' v mentioned ought to be of far bigger magnitude / edit : the crossed part - people are getting my intentions wrong, 
   invitro , lgbt those are just minor things that got little to no impact on the country and general wellbeing , just a small hindering . 
  i can not understand why people see those as important what is more important is state of education and economy - education program , gov expendature , beurocracy , coal mines , farmers or pension system are the things that need serious attention / edit : to be clear - i 'm not anti lgbt , quite the contrary , but there are way more important things that should be taken care of, 
  exam optional , but lessons obligatory - more hours than serious subjects like physics , chemistry or informatics . 
  complete waste of time and money, 
  i 'm talking about general use , not handful of words used in the ballot [ lexical distance among the languages of europe ] ( https://elms.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/lexicaldistanceielangs.jpg ) illustrates it pretty well . 
  gramatics and sounds are easy to get by when speaking , but when it comes to words and phrasals you need to flex the thesaurus much more than with other slavic languages, 
  i was waiting at kaczynski 's speach for `` beata here 's flowers , gj , now go away '' : ), 
  i hope your movement wo n't die out, 
  they all can : ), 
  do they ? 
  ( i may remember badly ) iirc number of people voting drops heavily after 16-17 . 
  over 50 % is pretty much a success here, 
  yes , goal is to attract as many people as possible, 
  voting ends at 21:00, 
  russian is pretty hard compared to others thou ( much of vocab is different ), 
  it 's 17:37 atm . 
  next press conference is at 18:30, 
  in hour time they will announce the turnout till 17:00, 
  this almost as glorious as ogorek-hime i miller-san fb profile for presidential elections, 
  in theory yes , but reality is even weirder - parties labeled as conservative vote for liberal things and liberal parties for conservative ideas . 
  there 's some inconsistency so take the labels with a grain of salt, 
  taxation changes usually take quite a long time to be implemented . 
  the two main parties do n't differ much in this matter anyway , it 's the small parties that plan to make big tax changes, 
  i expect `` inconclusive '' result - pis wo n't be able to create stable coalition and after year or two we will have early elections, 
  [ writeup about the parties ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pvwhr/parliamentary_elections_in_poland/ ), 
  it would be hypocritical if poland refused to accept other citizens that come legally to work . 
  in this case there 's nothing hypocritical about not wanting illegal imigrants that often do n't want to come here and may be source of various criminal problems, 
  you know what was ironic about it ? 
  it was introduced to prevent foreign powers from passing harmful legislature, 
  [ thread from yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pvwhr/parliamentary_elections_in_poland/ ) with decent writeup about parties, 
  tbh he himself does n't seem to know what he wants to change, 
  [ previous thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pvwhr/parliamentary_elections_in_poland/ ) did a great job, 
  same goes for me . 
  my hopes for results : 1 . 
  pis wo n't get big majority 2 . 
  kukiz wo n't get to be the 3rd option 3 . 
  razem gets to enter, 
  why the hell half of the video is a small party ?

  i thought lasers was lithuanian thing, 
  someone would like to come to poland , who would have thought ; ), 
  for music look up [ polish all-time top by 3rd program of national radio ] ( https://lp3.polskieradio.pl/polskitopnotowanie/ ) - songs of many bands from the doc can be found there [ yt playlist of all-time top 100 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pllfvawbp41dej0kk9gty7ggz0pdxeorwi ) ( mostly rock-blues ), 
  it has more deregatory shade than english `` rogue '' though, 
   true christian ( church on sundays , praying before eating , etc ) sounds like american redneck version of ideal christian i go to church when i visit my parents to make my mom/grandmom happy and that would be it . 
  agree with all aside from the geography part - most of it was about various proceses eg . 
  how different kind of erosion work or how cyclones work and where all the bigger rivers/seas/mountain ranges etc are . 
  only numeral thing to remember was hight/lenght of biggest mountain/river per contitinent - nothing from the economy part . 
  also small thing about math - highschool math has been going shit for quite some time to the point that universities need to make catchup curses as highschool program does n't even cover things like basic matrixes , derivatives or limits we also lack any finances subject ( the one we got is a complete joke ) that would cover some basics about income tax , fin . 
  institutions , pensions or fin.instruments - we live in a society where people do n't see a difference between debet and cradit card , got no idea how pension system work or how to make pit declaration and think stock exchange is a magic place for gambling where money comes and goes from out of nowhere, 
  poland failed hard : (, 
  well they got some of the things right ( like failed us/nato opperations in middle east ), 
  not only , he means the cis countries, 
  he probably means that european culture was mostly working as opposition to islamic one - reconquista , crusades , ottoman invasion etc , that islam was always something that `` came from outside '' . 
  there 's some truth to his claim , but there are also many holes . 
  / edit : people confusing cultural europe with continent are all over this thread, 
  yes, 
  wtf do you mean ? 
  neiodas has quoted me ... 
  you would have oil fields ? 
  spanish for traveling german , russian or french for business other pretty much for being cool  getting latin may also be quite useful as it can give you introduction to nearly all languages used in europe ( mostly via vocabulary as many words got latin roots , but it 's more of nerd thing , than actually being useful ), 
  if you study eg . 
  theology or philosophy . 
  i 'm more surprised about italian , it 's as usefull as polish or swedish, 
  everyone here thinks like that ; ), 
  not documentaries , but short vids : - [ poland is beautiful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbu_frg8vuu ) - [ promo for cycling route around eastern poland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/3n13yh/cool_promo_for_cycling_route_around_eastern_poland/ ) - [ poland and its tourist attractions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xxhtjwhdlq ) ( this one is 19min ), 
  it 's not polan . 
  it 's dumb westerners that come here and write stuff in google . 
  polish people use polish when searched in polish you get : in the eu , in shengen , in eurozone ( a bit less dumb ; ) ), 
  is n't that common knowledge ? 
  my results : ** poland ** : safe , rich , western country for neighbours : ** germany ** : continent or a country , continent or country nexus , in europe ** czech republic ** : in the eu , a country , part of eu ** slovakia ** : in the eu , a country , part of the eu ** ukraine ** : in the eu , in europe , a part of nato ** belarus ** : a country , in the eu , safe ** lithuania ** : in the eu , in europe , a country ** russia ** : going to attack poland ( lol ) , in europe , in asia, 
  it 's not latvians googling that, 
  you are a bit inconsistent ( or got confused with negations ),
