  so racing sports like f1 also does n't count ? 
  i ' v got quite impressing expirience with lithuanian students that come to poland to study - they usually speak lithuanian , polish , russian and english/german, 
  handball ? 
  i doubt . 
  2nd most popular ( that people follow ) would probably be volleball , ski jumps , mayby basketball, 
  would be the case if there was one basketball-tall men and all other were dwarfs with some variation . 
  also do you mean being popular as watched or played ? 
  if played then i would count on table tennis for watched - i got no idea, 
  no such one imo , the differences are too big, 
  nice but looks pretty empty, 
  i love when documentaries with him are aired on tv, 
  from important things : 17th international fryderyk chopin piano competition is ongoing [ official site ] ( http://chopincompetition2015.com/?lang=en ) [ concerts on yt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucstxol20q01uj-u5yp3iqfg/videos ) --------------------------------------------------------- as bonus : two songs by polish band `` organek '' i found out recently . 
  very groovy , has something of mississippi blues - [ o , matko !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfk8gqoucgw ) - [ g\u0142upi ja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnn7dnpdzlw ), 
  what the fuck ? 
  non of those ( aside from mayby 2 , but `` promotion '' is really weird word for their case ) are true , most are exact opposite ... ( at least for tv ), 
  kulczyk 's son may be no. 1 ; ), 
  it looks even better [ with their old coa ] ( http://www.olgakorbut.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/belarus-flag.png ) ( it 's also the lithuanian coa ) i had an idea for their new flag - to somehow use white flag with red ornament they got on the current one, 
  to be exact tvn is now fully owned by scripps networks interactive ( us capital ) , while polsat is owned in 57,89 % ( 63,83 % votes ) by 2nd richest polish buisnessman - zygmunt solorz-\u017bak via few companies : reddev investments ltd. , karswell ltd. , argumenol ltd. and embud sp .

   since beginning of migrant crisis : poor migrants , look at those women and children simply not true - usually they were starting with negatives like `` tone of migrants are storming x border cousing trubble in local towns , bla bla bla . '', 
  and ending with more sympathetic `` they are fleeing war , there are also families with children there '' . 
  some talk shows on the other hand were often doing only or mostly the sympathetic part  small web/right-wing media try to cover crisis from other angle but simply the audience is at best mediocre it 's very onesided , especially internet portals and facebook groups , which border heavy propaganda, 
  town : \u0141om\u017ca , poland coa : [ xvi one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/%c5%81om%c5%bca_herb_xvi.jpg ) ; [ 1870-1918 ( under russian empire rule ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/coat_of_arms_of_%c5%81om%c5%bca_gubernia_%28russian_empire%29.png ) ) , [ 1994 one ] ( http://www.ngw.nl/int/pol/l/images/lomza3.jpg ) and [ modern one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/pol_%c5%81om%c5%bca_coa.svg/750px-pol_%c5%81om%c5%bca_coa.svg.png ) history : sadly i do n't remember . 
  it 's not anything special though - it 's `` some ruler was walking around and noticed cool deer '' - type of story bonus : - it 's a brewary town so here 's [ the beer logo ] ( http://www.gmkfreelogos.com/logos/l/img/lomza-1.gif ) - [ football club logo ] ( http://i46.tinypic.com/2nun9ef.jpg ), 
   are polish doctors , on average , more conservative with their treatment preferences ? 
  the doctors on province are like that , their judgement is very often doubtful to say the least, 
  not for coa 's standards, 
  fixed, 
  aba colors + coa design is great ( plc , prussia , spain ), 
  yellow , green and red variation is also very common - [ many african countries use it ] ( https://www.colourbox.com/preview/7078571-set-of-buttons-with-flags-of-africa.jpg ), 
  current lithuanian flag looks horrible , imo it 's the worst one on par with belarussian ( the ornament looks cool though ) and lichtenstein 's, 
  i always found [ this polish-lithuanian commonwealth flag ] ( http://grafik.rp.pl/grafika2/218216,224701,16.jpg ) really cool , especially the shape and the placement of the coa . 
  as for others estii 's flag is really cool , from past flags i like the ussr & prussia ( thx u/timaeger ) from outside europe i love flags of kazahstan , s.korea , iran and qatar/bahrain, 
  i do n't see how is it an opportunity for anyone else than the catalans themselves, 
  if you paid more attention you would know about nowoczesna way before the presidential elections - balcerowicz was talking about it ( it did n't have a name yet though ) as for po i mostly support po , but lately they have been fucking up everything ( especially in the pr dep . ), 
  i along with my family all vote for nowoczesna - i like their polices and behaviour so far - concentraing on actual governing and economy instead of some pitty issues, 
   by asking reddit all you 're going to get is a bunch of liberal hipsters voting for korwin i love how korwin people are calling out pools for having low % of voters on him - they are not awere in how small internet boubble they are in, 
  0 . like all other people , never heard about any problems - there 's nearly no indians here though 1 . pretty well with comapnies like cdprojekt , techland , vivid gaming , 11bit studio etc 2 . gov does n't put it 's hands into the industry yet , so that 's great, 
  all they need to do is not to look like a beggar and all problems get fixed, 
  czech is like reversed polish and slovakian is just like polish , but different ; ), 
   favourite neighbour : polan expected belarus tbh, 
   do you think the annexation of that land has any meaning towards modern issues between your countries ? 
  a thing for far right people to circlejerk about, 
  could some german write those 17 theses down here ? 
  fair meaning what ? 
  ( serious question ) / edit : also source please ? 
   anyway , what exactly is the problem you are trying to solve ? 
  false prejudice and overblown fear mongering that is spread by far-right media i suppose / edit : why the downvotes ? 
  to make things clear my aim is to give some insight for people unfamiliar with this case , not to give excuses or , god forbid - sanction the partitions . 
  poland took small pice of land called [ zaolzie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie ) ( [ map ] ( http://www.historia.uwazamrze.pl/public/images/articles/904299d0903c36b3a09207ebb030a06c.jpg ) ; legend : demarcation line from 1918 ; border from 1920 ; part that poland took in ' 38 ) - it was `` created '' by spliting silesian cieszyn region after ww1 when borders of poland and czechoslovakia were being drown . 
  non of the countries were happy with the outcome as the region had mixed ethnicities ( polish and czech ) and was switched between the two countries constantly over the history spowning many conflicts . 
  tl ; dr : it 's a small toy ( which was n't even that cool ) that the two little brothers wanted for themselves and each stealing it as soon as the other was n't looking / edit : guys please do n't make this thread look like yt comment section, 
   ~ ~ free market ~ ~ buying arms is politics for the most part, 
  the gdp grew while debt stayed the same ( or grew slower ) or the debt itself dropped ? 
   really ? 
  no , like , similarity to `` paedophile '' ? 
  in the same way '' - phobe '' is associated with bigotry ? 
  you must have really limited vocab, 
  but often in a more annoying manner, 
   supporting a single refugee in norway costs $ 125,000 for how long ? 
  imo just make a proper post saying exactly what you want without the whole bullshit . 
  as it 's even hard to tell what 's the point of the thread, 
  something specific ? 
  what do you expect from uni , town , country ? 
  what kind of engineering are you thinking about ? 
  what speciafic locations you got in mind ? 
  you ' v written a box of text that conveys almost no information . 
  spend more than 10s and make a proper post,
