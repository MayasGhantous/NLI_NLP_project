  i guess it 's illigal by law , but when you catch you having it , they will say `` meh i do n't care '', 
  ofc it has cool places , but ammount dreadful palces was much higher than i expected, 
  1 ) no negative feelings 2 ) got family in chicago , got pretty dissapointed while visiting ( something around 2005 ) - us has always been seen as perfect world , as it turned up there 's nothing really impressing , many ugly , shady places 3 ) if it 's done in a douchy manner then yes . 
  in general it 's very neutral 4 ) anything outside standard american turist destinations ( london , paris , barcelona , italian big cities ) - go to eg . 
  netherlands , dennmark , slovenia , romania , hungary , austria , poland , even put some effort and go to belarus ( yes , it 's safe - probably safer than most of us , you will probably need to know russian though ) . 
  going to central/eastern/southeastern / baltics will also be way cheaper . 
  if you pick france , italy , uk , spain - then go to less known places . 
  you will have something to say to impress people , something new , no : `` i went to paris '' `` well , cool , everybody was there '' . 
  open a map make fast yt/wiki check on each country/region i recommand looking up [ wolter 's world vids ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/woltersworld ) - he has many cool guides for turists and `` 5 things you will love/hate about x-country/region/city '' series . 
  his channel is rich in usefull info . 
  some examples : - [ 10 signs you might be an ugly american tourist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kebjkfloefa ) - [ 10 things that will shock you about europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsbk_yhgq8 ) - [ differences between europe & the us : what you should know before you visit europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd3tms6sdmc ) - [ travel central europe : 5 things you will love & hate about central europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdmxsop743m ) - [ 10 things that are not overrated about europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrigk9t3ema ), 
   our government did n't let them come for years that 's not entirely true - some of them were given multiple occasions to come back , but they did n't want for various reasons - eg . 
  couse they did n't want to leave their family , friends and assets ( or sell ) behind, 
  at least you learnt this on the internet and did not embarass yourself irl [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/europe-blocs-49-89x4.svg/812px-europe-blocs-49-89x4.svg.png ) should make it clear, 
  susi ? 
  finland rocks, 
  it 's pretty complicated topic also you can not put slavs as the group , but rather have o focus on the regions - reasons will be different for central/east europe and balkans eli5 answer : - wars - cleansings - agrocultural region - missed out on colonial and industrial revolution 's benefits ( couse of wars and political struggle ) we had pretty bad luck with worst wars failures right before or during big civilisation leaps as said by u/embicek go with this question to / r/askhistorians ( use search it may be already answered ) for detailed answer . 
  frase the question a bit differently , your question got very racist ring to it . 
  in recent history yes , in general you are wrong . 
  it may be couse of the history - it 's been mainly agrocultural region ( when we speak about poland and ruslands ) that was handled over by various rulers , lot of wars and cleansings put the regions behind . 
  as for education and institutions you may simply be ignorant and not awere where some things come from like eg . 
  poland was the first country in the world to have [ ministry of education ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commission_of_national_education ) , when most countries had absolute monarchies we used democratic system , [ first constitution in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_may_3,_1791 ) was in poland , same with various social-religious rights , for science poland is the [ birth place of oil industry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignacy_%c5%81ukasiewicz ) , we also had quite big impact of various advancements in [ mathematics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lw%c3%b3w_school_of_mathematics ) and [ chemistry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_curie ) , [ list ] ( http://www.paccpnw.org/polish-contribution-to-world-science/ ) is pretty long spend a evening on wikipedia and read up on history of eg . 
  poland . 
  it will give you an idea and look up various countries ' contribution to science someone will surely make a better , more detailed response / edit : few links added, 
   if you want a subreddit more like this one a few years ago try / r/europes . 
  i do n't think it ill become a thing, 
  i guess you got islamism on mind not islam . 
  [ maajid nawaz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdhp9jtdxj8 ) is one of advocates for separating those and modernising islam, 
  how is succession creepy ? 
   what would help is re-branding islam as a cult and not a religion . 
  and what about normal muslims ? 
  yea socially it may be hard , but then again if we are speaking about such migration inside eu it 's not that bad - lot of people speak english , services got high standard , culture is very similar, 
  i know , i once met a dutch guy who `` figured out the system '' by living on welfare while moving to poland or recently there was an article on bankier.pl ( polish financial portal ) student from britain who lived in 3city ( gda\u0144sk / gdynia/sopot ) couse it was cheaper to live here and fly to london for his curses than to rent a flat in london . 
  magic of currency strength and living costs differences . 
  i wonder why people who do work in home via internet/phone eg . 
  forex investors , streamers , some app developers etc do n't just move to a cheap country - you do nearly nothing and your life standard goes up, 
   11,000 eur that 's pretty good yearly income ... 
  oh i though you got upset by my comment, 
  lol someone got overrustled, 
  necessarily no , but more than often yes . 
  ( in poland ), 
   a mosque is not just a building where muslims can go to pray , it 's a political center for the city . 
  and as such , the imam has a political role here . 
  sounds exactly like a church ; ), 
  yes i account for that . 
  and since it 's accepted i hope it wo n't look as bad as on visualisations, 
  yes , i stick with what i said, 
  i 'm very dissapoined that it got accepted . 
  it will be very hard for me to get used to them, 
   individually smelted , handcrafted pieces of aluminium covering a building with 3-story high gates to a theater , that at any point during a show can open to a city square is a `` shipping container '' ? 
  pretty much yes , a glass shipping container with aluminium fills that tries hard to look modern . 
  i absolutely hate this type of designs , especially when they are mixed into cities completly out of context , disregarding the surrounding buildings there 's nothing in this article that even gives any hope to this project imo . 
  are there any other visualisations or discriptions ? 
  interior looks cool , but outside ? 
  it 's just a brick made look modern . 
  in it 's case it 's not so bad since it 's in green park-like place with no big or fency buildings . 
  had it been placed near sky screapers in a concrete jungle it would look just horrendous, 
  i hate this kind of designs, 
   educated turks , iranians , ** russians ** , moroccans , etc. . . fit in fine in europe . 
  well they are european ... 
  oh god please no . 
  that would be a serious contender for `` makabry\u0142y '' award ( for worst urban architecture mistake ) . 
  why do people think a shipping container is a good model for a museum ? 
  communistic grey blocks look way better compared to that, 
  why is that . 
  they repeated over an over again that sending people to mars is not an option - it 's way to expensive , risky and everything we would want to do atm can be done with robots, 
  so something changed ? 
  iirc yesterday they said expelling the ambassador is not being even considered , or am i wrong ? 
  [ sketch from 1792 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awi%c4%85tynia_opatrzno%c5%9bci_bo%c5%bcej_w_warszawie#/media/file:hist9.jpg ), 
  had it at least looked nice . 
  i hate that style with passion, 
  looks to be 300 , but in another historical setting, 
   poland should be granted a `` special status '' in the eurasian sphere . 
  [ 1 ] i wonder what that means, 
  i 'm as much liberal as i am conservative  not everyone you disagree with is a nutjob . 
  ofc , but some opinions are beyond not only decency , but even legal line , which imo warrants calling people who hold such opinions nutjobs, 
   heir minds are drowned in the sea of liberal propaganda pushed by their beloved two faced politicians and media like being anti immigrants/muslims ? 
  it 's hilarious that people claim / r/europe to be place of right wing bigotry and leftist propaganda in the same time, 
  not exactly neo-nazis ( mainly couse it 's illegal ) , but quite close - a far right , racist , antisemitic , bit para-militaristic organisation that hoovers around the legal line . 
  i dunno what 's your problem . 
  you can order any flag design you want, 
  weaving flags ( or using national symbols ) is not considered nationalistic here - it 's just a thing you do during public holidays , celebrations , sport events etc. 
  it 's pretty detatched from politics or ideology . 
  in recent years some of the symbols started getting negative connotations thanks to popularity they 've been gaining among chav-like groups, 
  actually there 's snow all around poland https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ccw7b/poland_today/d9vmye5/, 
  couse fb blocked accounts of some far-right nutjobs, 
  weak slowpoke bait, 
  that colour is gay though , navy blue or black is the real 3 stripe colour, 
   everyone knows they were n't polish camps the thing is not everyone, 
  it was posted 2 times already : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bfqmy/china_launches_11_billion_fund_for_central/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bf7ud/china_launches_10_bln_euro_fund_for_central/, 
  at school we were taught that gymnasium means gym , but not so long ago i found out that gymnasium also works so i ditched the weird `` junior highschool '' term, 
  [ oi oi oi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=med2xiphjjm ), 
  nope , i was watching lot of starcraft, 
  polish ( native ) , english ( fluent ) , very little german and swedish and i know korean alphabet ( hangul ) in school you learn english or german as first foreign lang . 
  in gymnasium you pick 2nd foreign , usually from german/english/russian / french . 
  in highschool you can change 2nd foreign languge or continue previously picked one . 
  at uni i had foreign language for my specialisation ( economy/finances ) + had to pick one additional . 
  i could pick from : english/german/russian / french/spanish/italian / swedish . 
  high majority start with english , in my schools for 2nd people more or less followed ratios 6-3-1 ( german-russian-french ) . 
  at uni most people picked spanish or german as 2nd,
