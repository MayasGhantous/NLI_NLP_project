  it 's even already figured out : https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/4pn0p7/eli5_britain_is_officially_leaving_europe_where/, 
  actualy it 's just about overrustling polish users, 
   anti establishment how can you be anti-establishment if you are part of the establishment ? 
  that sounds more similar to bratislava, 
  the start was shaky though as in the winning elections possition shuffles they missed the deadline on sending the candidature for the aiib board of directions making us a `` lower member '' ( there 's some mistakes in what i said , i do n't remember the details , but the point is we lost a pretty significant inflence opportunity ),

  nope / edit : it 's not even that common on the wider internet - it 's a thing that revolves mostly around reddit and a bit of gamming communities, 
  for poland i guess it would be [ polish -- soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) just after ww1 . 
  it gives lot of context to things like polish participation of partition of czechoslovakia , relations between neighbours in eastern europe , evolution of communism and soviet `` help '' during/after ww2 . 
  from reddit i got the impression it 's a thing that is not even mentioned in not-directly-involved countries, 
  i do n't agree , it 's super brief though - pretty much only a date, 
  in poland we call it `` demokratura '' ( combination of democracy and dictatorship = dictatoriship of the majority ), 
  use google translator for polish names , msot of the times it does a decent job . 
  with english alphabet it would be something around vrocwav ( / vr\u0254t\u032a\u0361s\u032aw\u00e4v / ), 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=cooking&amp;restrict_sr=on yt channel with some polish ones : https://www.youtube.com/user/aniaskitchen, 
  yep , pretty much the the europeistan meme , nothing new, 
   we can just talk in our native tongues and understand most of what each are saying not exactly . 
  in most cases people instantly switch to english even if they are bad at it . 
  people recognise some words and structres , but if ask them to translate they are unable or get it wrong . 
  you can get to the level where each can speak his own language and be understood , but it require both sides to have expirience with the other language to know what pharases/words to use, 
  there 's quite big community of every nation in canada : ), 
  hungary does n't count as you are bounded by [ the magical rhyme of friendship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) , actually it 's a curse : ^ ), 
  ever since russia is a country and before that with russian predecessor states . 
  first one on wiki is from 981 vs kievian ru\u015b ( [ list of wars involving poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_poland ) ), 
  iirc georgians also like us, 
  weird english spelling strikes again !, 
  i only give it couse it covers people 's procentage responses pretty well, 
   a west/east divide with no centre better represents the countries ' alignments the thing is it 's not true today . 
  would n't be much of a problem if he had n't introduce `` central '' at all, 
  depends on pairs and how much of another language the speakers know , [ this ] ( https://elms.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/lexicaldistanceielangs.jpg ) show how much who understands whom pretty well, 
   meanwhile our chechen ( muslim ) refugees from the time of chechen wars seem to like it here , even though our country was much poorer at the time they sought asylum in poland . 
  actually that 's not exactly true . 
  many just failed to get to germany . 
  those who stayed even after so many years are not able to get a stable job and sit in criminal grey zone . 
  i do n't know the numbers , but saying that we succeed in integrating chechens is way overexagerated / edit : damn english uses our `` cz '' for czechs , but not for others ... eh, 
  ymd also works in poland , so does writting name in surname name order, 
  ah , i expected a detailed article , quite underwhelming ; (, 
  same here i always remember it as being a cold day and often it was one of the first days with snow, 
  eee why would one replace another ? 
  if anything halloween can be set up against andrzejki, 
  i prefer snow way better, 
  except it has been raining for the whole day in nearly the whole country . 
  worst 01.11 weather ever, 
  not for parties and not what is considered a national alcohol though i wonder how is it possible for spirits to have bigger consumption than beer/wine when both wine and beer is more casual beverage, 
  czechs prefer beer while hungarians and slovakians p\u00e1linka ( i guess ) . 
  only poland is a vodka country from the 4, 
   jan tomasz gross ok also they could n't make a better clickbait title, 
  some churches in my hometown got big banners in front of them saying that `` it 's a sin to celebrate halloween '' and around this time of year it 's nearly a must to hear how evil and anti-christian halloween is during the mass, 
  getting the accent and day-to-day lingo is pain in the ass though, 
  i 'm so saving that, 
  yes , as soon they learn they can not move to germany/sweden ( having really overblown expectations ) they do n't want to come or go back . 
  it 's not all ofc , but group big enough that made refugee supporters switch their possition . 
  same thing for other countries, 
   where is the will to help war torn people ? 
  split between various policies . 
  funnily enough there 's also lack of will to be helped as well, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe#number_of_stars  the number of stars on the flag is fixed at 12 , and is not related to the number of member states of the eu ( although the eu did have 12 member states from 1986 to 1994 ) . 
  this is because it originally was the flag of the council of europe . 
  [ 30 ] in 1953 , the council of europe had 15 members ; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member , and would not change based on future members . 
  west germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of saarland , and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region . 
  [ 14 ] twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity . 
  [ 30 ] in his 2006 book boris johnson drew attention to the emperor necklace which depicts twelve caesars , and looks ` uncannily like the euro flag ' . 
  [ 59 ] while 12 is the correct number of stars , sometimes flags or emblems can be found that incorrectly show 15 ( as of the rejected proposal ) or 25 ( as suggested by some after the expansion of the eu to 25 member states in 2004 ) . 
  [ 60 ] [ 61 ] however , the flag also remains that of the council of europe , which now has 47 member states . 
  number of stars is not tied with number of members . 
  also it 's not flag of eu , it 's flag of [ council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) ( which groups all countries in europe , minus temporarily belarus for being a dictatorship ) , eu just adopted it, 
  way overrated imo, 
  \u00f3 = u ( it 's pronounced the same , just orthography ) polish '' \u0142 '' = english `` w '', 
  ugh that looks even worse, 
  from my dad 's company ( ac/ventilation ) expirience supportened by expirience by entroponour from other side of poland ( hydraulics ) from the same sector ( building ) - it 's really hard to get anyone to work with requirements as low as just willing to work and being sober for the entry pay equal or more than entry in some financial corporation where you need master degree + minimum one fluent foreign language . 
  the requirements are nearly non existant and the pay is decent, 
  unless they got polish/lithuanian roots , they go to russia instead, 
   problem is locals do n't want to work for a shitty wage not exactly - in building sector there is just no workforce , it 's not a wage problem, 
  people are often not so keen on hiring ukrainains, 
   interesting , you changed what we are talking about as you realized i was right and when was that ? 
  stop being so full of yourself , i ' v pointed out multiple times what i exactly mean and have been consistent the whole time . 
  talking with you is like talking to a wall, 
   ethnic group is what we 're discussing . 
  we are not , we are talking about nationality/culture . 
   i 'm not the extremely ignorant one . 
  and not even once you proved me wrong, 
   you really do n't get things do you ? 
  polish education ... same can be said about you  your example is an ethnic group displacing another no displacing happens in the example , just switch in rulling . 
   would you not call the above americanized turks ? 
  ethnically yes - they are turks , nationality wise - most likely not , at this point we can speak of a new nation . 
  to sum up again - yes turkic people lived in the are of byzantine , but there 's no continuation between the byzantine and ottoman/turkey , they are in two separate brackets, 
  gda\u0144sk ( 3city ) it 's okeish , nearly all the perks of seaside go away though . 
  if there 's freezing weather you can see frozen molo - [ it looks pretty cool ] ( https://www.arcyfotka.pl/photos/59/standard/jp1p5ydd.1c5.jpg ) when all the lamps and breakwaters turn into walls/pilars of ice krak\u00f3w + zakopane would be much better option for winter, 
   europe is called `` europa '' in italian , portuguese , romanian , spanish in nearly all languages aside from english  / edit : in before people start giving examples where it is n't the same - i know there was thread about taht no so long ago,

  no it does n't ef english proficiency index :  the ef epi fifth edition was calculated using test data from 900,000 test takers in 2014 . 
  the test takers were self-selected and no demographic information was collected on them . 
  the tests are used by the company for marketing and placement purposes . 
  68 countries and 2 territories appear in the fifth edition of the index . 
  in order to be included a country was required to have at least 400 test takers total,
