  they are part of 3city aglomeration ( gdansk , gdynia and sopot , they are basically one city ) foreigners usually dont know that and stay only in gdansk missing out on stuff that is 15min `` metro '' ( skm , a train line that works like on-ground metro for the aglomeration ) ride away, 
  russia is a european country that expanded eastwards . 
  - stans are often included as they were partof ussr ( they are nearly never included though ) turkey had big influence in europe and wants to be considered as part of europe, 
  albania got popular recently here . 
  / edit : as turist destination, 
  you mean kartacze and babka ziemniaczana . 
  anyway also my fav . 
  i liked the kvass as a kid , it 's called kwas chlebowy ( = bread acid ) in poland , but now i consider it rather meh, 
  waiting for some belarusian redditors to comment, 
  fencing ( may it be sport , classical or hema ) is pretty cool hobby . 
  for a year now i ' v been training amateurly classical fencing ( [ my club 's yt channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwkmg9bbif0 ) ; in sabre , started smallsword recently ) and i regret not having started doing it earlier, 
  and small : \u0142, 
  not having an overblown social system has it 's benefits , 
  i ' v heard a variation of the joke with stalin : kids run to stalin screaming `` uncle stalin , uncle stalin give us some candies '' stalin turns to them and says `` gtfo '' along with [ this ] ( http://www.quickmeme.com/img/46/468b272e308ab18d2b1507d0ca66730d503f28ed373c50ac20a6b20f7170ff11.jpg ) gesture . 
  kids run away terrified . 
  men watching the whole situation comments on the event to his friend : `` see?stalin is good man . 
  he could have killed them '', 
  you got some germans to cheer for - hartung or [ limbach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfmsbj8b5we&amp;index=14 ) compilations are cool , matches ( in sport fencing aka the olympic one ) on themselves are more than often boring to watch especially for someone who does n't know the sport . 
  sabre for example in 90 % is 1 !, 
  two sabrerers lunge at each other both score and the referee just decides who had the right of way and so till someone hits 15 or in epee where the fencers can jump around `` doing nothing '' for 30s just to do a suiccide fl\u00e8che ( it 's a move where you throw yourself at the opponent supermen-style ), 
  well duh , it 's even documented - [ stalin planting trees in smole\u0144sk in 1940 ] ( http://www.rozenek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/stalin-sadzi-brzoze-w-smolensku.jpg ), 
  ah , i missed - i thought you had tchaikovsky ( english transcription looks horrendously ) in mind, 
  i ' v written my favs , if i had to give the fair due to everyone the list would be much longer , 
  it spawned various consipracy theories and people started to be weary of russia, 
  that 's a smile emot ? 
  would never have thought , it looks more like irritated emot to me, 
  i thought that ireland had their own satellites , even poland has few, 
  born russian , identyfies as russian , but has additionaly dual russian-austrian citizenship ( from what i read austrian was only for getting easier access to other countries as russia needs visa to pretty much everywhere in western world ), 
   everybody seems to hate/dislike russia current putin 's politics to be clear . 
  there was time things looked like our relations will get fixed like they did with germany , but then russia invaded georgia , polish president died in a plane crash and now ukraine  russia has done for you , your country , the world ? 
  well they kind of helped with rebuilding just after the ww2 , but what was going along side and after makes that pretty much irrevelant . 
  from possitives : - definitly culture - i 'm big fan of russian classical music ( composers like eg . 
  rachmaninoff , shostakovich , prokofiev or opera singers like anna netrebko ) and obviously best army choir - [ alexandrov ensemble ( aka the red army choir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandrov_ensemble ) . 
  also other disciplines like balley or literature - sport : big fan of russian sabre men team ( [ yakimenko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsmxx8rhk0 ) , [ kovalev ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2af7lodmlxa ) ftw ) , they are my 2nd fav team ( after hungarians ), 
  a bit outdated , do n't you think ? 
  not much happens there - it 's pretty peacefull country , they are not part of eu so you do n't see them on all the graphs from eurostat , they are not a popular turist destination ( you need visa ) either , they do n't search for attention . 
  lately they were involved as mediator for ukrainian conflict , there were also some talks about the eurasian economic union or helped with walking around the russian embargo put on eu states even in poland , as their close neighbour we do n't hear much from them from more up to date things they are having presidential elcections on 11th october / edit fixed date and union name , thx u/thefairyguineapig, 
   cybernetic seems someone watched too many movies, 
   as capitalism continues to fail in europe continues to fail ? 
  something to back that up ? 
  now or still waiting if we pick out international power peak , then it sucks for general people . 
  wellbeing of the people is best atm and still rising so i guess now is the time, 
  well our reddit neighbour - / r/european is best example, 
  4 ) russian front would probably also pop up, 
   or an experiment to see how high taxes and unemployment can go . 
  hmm it 's not bad ( [ 9,8 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:unemployment_rates,_seasonally_adjusted,_june_2015.png ) ) , some regions got serious truble though, 
  really ? 
  what kind od school is that ? 
  new earth creationism is source of ton of conspiration stories thats why i included it . 
  i doubt that ( i 'm 24 ) , mayby it was just to meh ( not very special nor original ) to remember, 
  well us is on completley different level with their reptilians and new-earth creationism, 
  was n't that tvn ? 
   there is an evil plan to destroy latvians and the government is in on it . 
  currently it seems that black muslims are being deployed by eu to marry all our girls . 
  that 's the general `` anti-white '' conspiracy, 
  have n't heard about this one yet, 
   providing the invisible population with hot meals and ** psychological support ** once a week . 
  i can not trust any religious organisation fur such support, 
  such parks are popular attraction for kids in poland . 
  few years ago they started to pop up everywhere, 
   ignoring directing the flood into one place, 
  use of % are pointless here since the market is so small, 
  well indeed they should make another one , last news in the main post is 3 days old , and it has 3 pages worth of links, 
  i wonder how can a updated sticky thread that is on top of the forum can be regarded as `` ignoring '', 
  lol, 
  already posted https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3frno2/immigration_megathread_part_vi/, 
  there 's no ignoring , it 's just good buffer for all the overload of shit threads that pop up regarding the issue, 
  no thx it 's much better this way, 
  do n't be worse , remove visa ; ), 
  same case in poland , it 's changing though, 
  that 's pretty weird, 
  it 's not about this tragedy but general way history is presented in poland . 
   an allergic reaction when seeing something about your own country ? 
  i ' v got nothing against posting stuff like this , it 's always good to know more , but the huge disproportion of attention given to countries in this sub is pretty annoying , nearly forcing thing up people 's throats . 
  i would genuinly like to have a series like that about all countries ( country of the week series is a good start ) . 
  poland has been the headline country on this sub for quite some time, 
  welcome to poland where we build memorials and celebrate failures instead of victories, 
  well russians generally do n't know either `` why so mad at ussr ? 
  we freed you from nazi occupation and rebuild your country after the war ... '', 
  each few days there 's some historical fact about poland posted , can we call it a series now ? 
  `` learn history - poland '', 
  there 's also few of polan being asshole , i do n't remember them well enough to find, 
   the people of aachen could n't finish their cathedral , so they asked the devil for help . 
  he helped under the condition of getting the first soul entering the cathedral , since it was usually the bishop . 
  when the cathedral was finished they sent in a goat first and the devil got that soul . 
  i believe it 's pretty common story , i ' v heard it multiple times regarding polish cathedrals as well, 
  if greeks back that up i call it legit, 
  cola needs time . 
  vinegar does it fast . 
  i use it to keep my sabre and spada blades in good condition or to remove stone left by water in kitchen/bathroom . 
  if it 's til for you , then i recomand to try it out . 
  it 's also good for eliminating bad smell, 
  to close to polan, 
  ah , in poland vinegar was the only thing that was in stock in shops, 
  vinegar ? 
  no thx, 
  what is the first weave and what coused it to drop ? 
  from # 4  the euro will be the biggest clash both parties are one the same page on euro atm - we ' r not planing to switch to euro in the nearest future, 
   vinegar is only good for cleaning rust out of steel, 
  couse they are most common , generally liked ones there 's no point in having stash of 40 sauces to please everyone,
