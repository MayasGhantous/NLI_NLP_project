  ranczo is pure gold of a show though, 
  it 's not a symbol of the revolution though - such cockade is used as symbol for remembrance in general, 
  sport things do n't get much traction here from what i ' v noticed, 
  the polish-hungarian flags ribbon with `` 60th anniversary of the hungarian revolution '' caption in a screen corner on our public tv channels look way better [ screen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dmunie6.png ), 
  hmm was n't poland and baltics states one of the countires that have been the ones pushing for eu army ? 
  i ' v just noticed we got polish-hungarian flags ribbon with `` 60th anniversary of the hungarian revolution '' caption in a screen corner on our public tv channels / edit : [ screen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dmunie6.png ), 
  it 's similar in poland and it 's pretty much useless especially for young people . 
  we got a bit administrative nonsense due to that we got 3 types of adresses : - zameldowania ( reginstered ) - zamieszkania ( where you live ) - korespondencyjny ( where to send mail ) in many cases all 3 are different . 
  the first one is seen as reminiscence of communism and many institutions just do n't even bother asking for it as by default it 's considered to be outdated . 
  there was a anger venting thread about that on / r/polska not so long ago, 
  couse you need to value risk in one way or another, 
  usual question for this kind of map : if i 'm living 400 km away from my parents in a flat that belongs to them am i living with them in the stats ? 
  does it go by where we are registered ? 
  if so the data is useless ( at least for poland ), 
  which side is terrible according to you ? 
  - that people are living with their parent or not ? 
  steorotypes can also be facts, 
   riverside - found i do n't think they count as they sing only in english,

  did n't you know that peter the great was a viking chieftain ? 
  couse majority of production in the western world is from us . 
  if it 's from another country you do n't hear about what company made it but [ insert nation ] production . 
  it 's even the case for countries with huge movie industry like india, 
  1 . americans are one of the most liked nations ( in poland ) 2 . from cities most standard destinations : warsaw , krak\u00f3w , 3city if you got more time : malbork , toru\u0144 , wroc\u0142aw , pozna\u0144 , zamo\u015b\u0107 , lublin , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , zakopane ; [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs6iij3cls ) , [ another one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekz6i58kvpi ) or [ castles/palaces from southern poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxbqr7v_plu ) 3 . generally yes - you can find many travel vblogs with people traveling around poland with just english , knowing some polish always helps ; watch [ feather and the wind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uco_btbktpylvm84f3ulb2rq ) channel - they been in poland for around a month this summer/autumn and made some vids, 
  that would be pretty hilarious, 
  size though, 
  pretty much all capitals got that name, 
   there is no clear centre oo warsaw is one of the cities where we got clear center unlike eg . 
  all : moscov , warsaw , kiev , prague , bucharest and riga are in europe, 
  it 's funny couse foreigners overwhelmingly find the building very cool . 
   ( this kind of art deco is hard to come by in europe ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_sisters_ ( moscow ), 
  if you want to see how pre war warsaw looked liked watch vids from [ this channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc_7uzhh0kcna70a5ubpoohg ) - it 's a collection of archival vids ( some even coloured ) and photos with pre war music, 
  there were multiple petitions to tear it down over the years . 
  many people do n't like it , but it became a symbol of warsaw . 
  the `` compromise '' is to leave it and surround it with skyscreapers so that it does n't dominate the skyline, 
  [ old vids , pictures ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bibcosaz_0w ) - the channel is full various archival vids of pre war warsaw, 
  i 'm not saying turks did n't live there - i 'm saying they were not byzantines . 
  on more modern , hypothetical example - had kurds gained power and took control over area that is today turkey and created a new state , would you call them turkish ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  and sorry to dissapoint you but ottomans were invaders of byzantine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine%e2%80%93ottoman_wars https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fall_of_constantinople, 
   i do n't even understand what this sentance means ? 
  you equated different people groups with each other  we are hellenized and then turkified , still the same people for that . 
  you got extremally wide understanding of `` the same people '' . 
  once hellenized or turkified or whatever else it 's not longer the same people group  i 'd love to see your statement backed up atleast one argument . 
  compelete change of law , culture , religion , traditions, 
   turks = ottomans , byzantines , anatolians . 
  this is wrong . 
  you confuse nationalities , `` race '' / language group and local groups . 
  turkey/ottoman empire are not successor states of byzantine empire, 
  what ignorance ? 
  i did n't say anything that conflicts with what you said, 
  most of the science is done in companies or institues ( or funded by them ) it 's quite rare for the university to be the one handling this considering their super small patent budget, 
  that 's just the average minimum pay they got from uni ( aka for teaching ) . 
  those do n't account being employed in other companies or institutes . 
  norway ? 
  it 's not an eu flag it 's flag of [ council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) , which has every european country ( with belarus having temporary ban ), 
   what was n't there a shortage off vinegar , 
  quote from one russian lady i heard is just priceless : `` we did not invade poland , we just entered the war when germans attacked us in grodno '' `` but miss , grodno was a polish city then ... '' '' / / awkward silence / / '', 
  you had those if you had either family in rural areas or good contacts , 
   in poland we had little tickets that allocated us only a few slices of meat and bread/month . 
  that was the case only in short pinnacle of crisis and even then it was n't so bad - there was no hunger - you just had no freedom to pick and chose what they want . 
  as for rising family it was n't so bad either , probably even better than today ( some priorities have changed though ) . 
  easiest way to expain it to westerner is to shift the credit system from `` buy and pay off the credit '' to `` sign on the waiting list and get when time comes '' with asterixes : there 's no middle class , you do n't pick what you want , you need to cheat to get anything fancy, 
  yes , but who had it in our eastern block ? 
  obviously , there are still people who say it was better back then - secured work , healthcare , education , integration trips with other work places , you did n't have to mess your head with picking what model of someting to buy . 
   http://chrisniedenthal.com/en/works/gielda-1988 stock exchange during communism ? 
  what the hell, 
  pretty much yes . 
  it 's pretty dumb to be searching for things you do n't like just to make fuss about it . 
  you do n't go to / r/dogs and make threads about how much you hate dogs and want them to die, 
  german way is better - both sides should acknowledge the past and say `` sorry '' for mistakes, 
  couse it has debt problems, 
  with italy ? 
   i really hope a two speed eu is created so that the west can go ahead . 
  you would have to redefine `` west '' in this scenario, 
   and plenty of aggressive eurosceptisim on the other side but most of those eurosceptics are not even eurosceptics in the slightes form - people/parties are lebeled as `` eurosceptic '' if they do n't agree with/have different ideas from the leading parties, 
  couse it 's a movie about historical event where poles are the victims . 
  i would like to know if it 's worth watching or is it a overly victimised , patritic bubble to leach from school trips . 
  so far i ' v got only one opinion ( possitive ) from my friend and i 'm looking for more, 
  anyone seen it yet ? 
  is it similar to katy\u0144 ? 
  how else do you plan to price long term assets ? 
  throw darts at board ? 
  yet you have to do them for long term things ( not in this form ofc ), 
  the thing you will probably feel the most : there will very little sun - you wake up at 7:00 - still dark , you get home back at 15:00 it 's already getting dark , plus it 's often cloudy so you may not see sun for couple of days straight . 
  people from your region tend to suffer from lack of it . 
  also if they city uses salt say bye to your leather shoes, 
  different climate , you would feel it differenty in eg . 
  continental cold is `` better '' . 
  my expirienced record was something around -30 ' c at night . 
  it 's the temperature at which jeans trousers get hard and the chill makes you feel pain, 
  but the cold is dry cold - you feel it differently ( + it 's often sunny and little wind ) to give you an idea : the way you feel at -15 ' c in hummid , near sea regions will be similar to -25 ' c in dry ( continental ) i prefer the dry colds much more, 
  but ugh you do n't call countries / country / - ball , just country,
