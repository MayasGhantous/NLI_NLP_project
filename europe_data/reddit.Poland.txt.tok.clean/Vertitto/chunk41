   estonia got its independence in 1918 , not in 1991 . 
  the latter was just the restoration of independence . 
  when talking about independence you always give the most recent date , otherwise for many countries it turns into a big clusterfuck, 
  turkey is not byzantium though , it 's quite the opposite actually - the invaders/conquers of it, 
  not really like russia . 
  russia is more like uk ( with it 's old commonwealth ) or france ( with it 's overseas territories ) - a european country that expaned outside europe . 
  turkey is middle eastern country that creeped into europe , got pushed back , wanted to be european , but has second thoughts, 
  aside from problems connected with recreating a country after over a century of partitions the time between ww1 and ww2 was n't a peaceful one for the region , we had 2 small wars ( [ vs lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_war ) and [ vs czechoslovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war ) and one very big one [ vs soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) . 
  pretty hard times for a country to be democratic, 
   currently it seems we use the eu flag for europe it 's reversed - eu uses the `` flag of europe '' i do n't really think it 's necessary, 
  it was posted yesterday , was n't it ? 
   anti-eu referendum lol, 
  what i was saying is what you see on most photos is not what you will see irl, 
  but it 's about eyes not hi-tech gear, 
  and rest back to syria , 
  most of the you-can-see-milky-way photos are photoshoped though - you wo n't see a cool big bright colorful nebula , but just shit ton of stars, 
   liechtenstein : pokemon go meetup last weekend in schaan . 
  next week is in vaduz . 
  wow pokemon go is still a thing ? 
  that looks like a / r/vexillology shitpost, 
  like euro castles/palaces ? 
  look up top100 castles/palaces in europe by country : - [ poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvpx_ewox98 ) ; smaller compilation vids : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8qs1zvyfce ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eggysqhimfe ) - [ france 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmqnkwoe6c ) , [ france2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5vugtnwaxu ) - [ belgium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uole1hupllw ) - [ netherlands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsmvcmdpefi ) - [ germany1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0_bv_gcdsq ) , [ germany2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1j1sm3qh0 ) - [ sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw4akoek0gi ) - [ dennmark/norway/finland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4iex--x9iq ) - [ swiss ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnz2if0pzr8 ) - [ austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h__fp1nfam ) - [ romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7emhwj8bw ) - [ hungary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyaztxdq5ts ) - [ slovakia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ebyg_7n2qs ) - [ czech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xblk4arsy_o ), 
  actually [ they do ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lofeikt.png ) ( [ source ] ( http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/ ) ), 
  they have been compared with each other from the beginning, 
  world just need to get polonized to avoid those, 
  thread from yesterday : [ if you could only recommend three tv shows which highlights the best of what your country has to offer , which would you choose ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/53zf55/if_you_could_only_recommend_three_tv_shows_which/ ), 
  that depends on the country/region, 
  and how is that ironic to the situation ? 
  actually it 's not a fact , but opinion, 
  or reverse since the kid will need gov support and can end up as unproductive ass . 
  your argument does n't work, 
  there are natural methods to provoke miscarriage , i do n't remeber which plant it is though . 
  what ? 
  came back ? 
  was n't it always there ? 
  bonus of politically active church, 
  well it 's not failing , but it 's taking few steps backwards, 
  christians are creationist by pretty much definition . 
  the difference is how much . 
  catholic church has the most hands off approach - `` god created stuff , but how and when it 's not our business , that 's for science to figure out '' . 
  from my expirience the only people not being for evolution ( eg in polls where they ask `` do you believe god created people '' ) are those who do n't know/didn ' t ever care eg . 
  old people who did n't have much education . 
  i do n't think i ' v ever met anyone who was of the `` evolution is an elaborate lie '' type of people, 
  it looks more like a longer average/low quality reddit post, 
  now it 's not as standard as it used to be , but still expected, 
  in polish law wodka is alcoholic drink made of grain ( msotly rye ; things like corn , grapes , fruits do n't count ) or potatoes that is at least 37,5 % strong, 
  potato wodka is more of a russian thing , we usually make it from various grains, 
  you nearly never shakehands with teachers in general here . 
  pretty much only occasion you do is teachers day/end of school year/prom when you take your diploma or give flowers ( handshake + 3 cheek kisses ), 
  strong alcohols , potatoes ? 
  serbo-croatian and little less czech are guilty of that, 
  first [ diagram ] ( http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/1637-1-med.gif ) i found with muslim countries, 
  i guess all abrahmic - muslims , orthodox and some smaller protestant churches got most problems with it i think, 
  we are not the ones backward in this department, 
  i thought you derped and thought albania was part of yugoslavia , but it turned out i was the one who forgot about kosovo :(, 
  they could have given the polls they mentioned, 
  albanian ? 
  yes , couse it 's easier to writte that instead of few nations that speak the same/similar languge, 
  probably probability of attack as poles are largest group : ~ 831.000 poles vs just 85.000 slovaks or 49.000 czechs, 
  it 's yugos that do n't use vovels , not us . 
  we use cv or ccv structures . 
  / edit : we got the illusion couse we got doubble letters like sz , cz , dz , d\u017a , d\u017c , rz, 
  or are talking about different things like potential, 
  already n front page https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53m4sl/just_under_30_percent_of_french_muslims_reject/, 
  my guess those are belarusians who got lithuanian citizenship , but live in bealrus, 
   immigration in europe : map of the percentages and countries of origin of immigrants polan overtook indians recently, 
  the problem is that it 's univeral bank , not only investing one, 
  it ' a a thread for / r/askeurope, 
  i guess he may meant doubble plural, 
  not really . 
  they do n't plan to `` do '' anything , just hunt for companies to reginster themselves under luxemburg administration . 
  they want to be the first ones to regulate space things that create money, 
  it 's pretty old news : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4mfe9b/luxembourg_opens_200_millions_line_of_credit_to/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4402te/luxembourg_to_support_space_mining_bbc_news/, 
  yea , key feature : clarity if it 's missleading , you change it, 
  what ? 
  there 's not such rule you can not opinionate the article or misrepresent it . 
  you can title it as you want as long as it 's in line with what it is about, 
  couse passport is about citizenship not nationality, 
   you ca n't expect that you 'll turn from soviet to swiss in a decade actually you can . 
  japan , s.korea , singapur are examples of `` over night '' change from a feudal shithole to hightech powerhouse, 
  you still did n't get the idea that this kind of threads are for / r/askeurope ? 
  it 's just an impression i get from reddit - each time a party is from the right side of the spectrum it instantly gets `` populist '' or `` far right '' tags, 
  why is `` populist '' added always to right wing ? 
  are they really populist or just a meaningless tag ? 
  and [ delated ] ... 
  if we could scale the success with years then anna german would probably no1 in poland . 
  there 's been a well received tv series about her [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fel7od-ugem ) . 
  most popular songs in polish : [ cz\u0142owieczy los ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6cchuc3aoa ) and [ ta\u0144cz\u0105ce eurydyki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gymrazx9z1o ) or [ \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438 , \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438 , \u043c\u043e\u044f \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0mcrf0lwme ) or [ \u042d\u0445\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ols3r6nzink ) in russian, 
  it was posted here few times already , each time they got deleted or downvoted, 
  so to start : poland : [ to nie ja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl5rmmpihp8 ) from eurovision '94 or [ colours of the wind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4udfzegf4rm ) from pocahontas, 
  well if you put it like that it is hypocritical , but that 's not what 's been happing, 
  seems ok for me  ( also nice missleading way of puting it ), 
  worth it, 
  it 's not like the kid will get recognised and have problems couse of that, 
  the meme attempt is really weak , but i do n't see any problem with the kids face, 
  you do n't spend much time on the net , do you ? 
  1 . depends on people , for typical polish family it would be probably max once a month , for students it can be few times a week . 
  in general eating out is becoming more popular due to small , cheap and homemade foods restaurants 2 . every 1-2 days ( things like bread , veggies , milk etc you buy nearly everyday ) 3 . you can buy them , but it 's more of a last resort thing ( frozen veggies are excepton ) 4 . way cheaper to eat fresh , homemade foods . 
  5 . my father 's expirience - it sucks : hard to get good bread , veggies or `` small meat '' ( by which i meanthings you put on sandwiches or sausages ),
