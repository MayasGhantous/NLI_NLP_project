  why ? 
  to prevent evil masons from corrupting the youth , 
  let 's all sing along to the [ pedofeel song ] ( https://youtu.be/6vc1yvwsfr0?t=1m20s ), 
  it was posted here today already use search https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/533frz/negative_attitudes_toward_immigrants_by_natives/, 
   all political parties still support joining the euro . 
  and i think a majority of romanians still do , that 's the first rule of postponing - make an ilussuin that you are working towards it, 
  and [ we all will be running in circles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ttggiqpauc ), 
  he 's not the equivalent of robin hood though while robin hood had some noble goals and stol from rich nad gave to poor , janosik stole from everyone and from time to time gave money to the village where his girlfriend lived, 
  couse it 's already posted : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wxhyt/polish_tales_pan_twardowsky_new_short_film_by/, 
  would be cool if it had subs, 
  polan so open, 
  a bit related - [ the witcher 3 : hearts of stone story discussion ( ending spoilers ! ), 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqhsmifjqjc ) by super bunnyhop , the video goes about the legend ( around 2min , but mostly in relation to witcher ), 
  it will be changed to yurop, 
  lol no, 
   russian orthodox church started complaining about how the display of such a ` satanic ' symbol would attract disasters to the city , so the local authorities did not allow it out of all the possible reasons they could give they gave the most retarded one, 
  and the disgust and pain when you ask for bread and they bring you some foam-like tasteless thing , ughh, 
  for future : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_currencies_in_europe, 
  nutella is not that popular here though i believe, 
  silent chocolate-flavoured eugenics, 
  and various candy eg . 
  waffle bars or as a coating for sweet things like fruit jelly , so in general when only little of the chocolate is used, 
  what city ? 
  yes , but i can not find it being called chocolate on the pic, 
  we nearly do n't use spices though, 
  imo one of the gold hoarding micornations like monako ( i would imagine more with white suit though ) , luksemburg or lichtenstein , mayby swiss, 
  hershey is a us company that makes chocolate-like products , not really available in europe . 
  it 's `` illegal '' couse it 's a crime against real chocolate and european values to have it sold in europe, 
  it 's a yurop stronk circlejerk post, 
  french do n't see a difference between nationality and citizienship, 
  they would also have to buy disney, 
  i wonder if they could keep it up after elections , nowoczesna derailed into standard polish politics pretty fast, 
  many languages got that , reverse situation where there 's no gender used at all is pretty unique, 
  here school year starts in 1st sep. and ends in 2nd half of june , meanwhile you got 2 weeks winter holidays , ~ week , week and half for newyear + christmas , up to a week for easter and various smaller holidays [ calendar for 2016/2017 ] ( http://www.kalendarzswiat.pl/kalendarz_szkolny ) ( green + orange are free and yellow is mostly exam days , which include elementary , gymnasium and high school ) + few free days for special days or to fill days between free days, 
  looks also normal for poland ( but not so evenly spaced ), 
  my bad , missread , but the point still stands - nominals more important thatn change, 
  / edit : my bad read to fast and my mind went `` oh unemployment went down '' . 
  i leave the rest couse it 's interesting nontheless ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ in some countries it does n't have to lower any more though , it 's one of the indicators where nominal values are more important that change for comparison germany has ~ 4,7 % , uk ~ 5,4 % , czech around 4 % even poland went below 7 % , while croatia sits in double digits around 15 % when eu average is 8,7 % [ source ] ( https://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:pl:uk:de&amp;hl=pl&amp;dl=pl#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:pl:uk:de:hr&amp;idim=country_group:eu&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=pl&amp;dl=pl&amp;ind=false ), 
   twitter why ? 
  from my perspective it 's most useless of socialmedia, 
  he 's prepared for both melee and ranged though, 
  did n't you also have [ czterej pancerni i pies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czterej_pancerni_i_pies ) ? 
  my impression is that nationality meant what language you speak as main, 
  did n't they stop airing them something like 15 years ago ? 
  yea , but word cup where everyone sings along is not a great place to do that, 
  should have added that it 's best polish performance in eurovision she also did one of most popular disnay songs in poland : [ colors of the wind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4udfzegf4rm ) from pocahontas it 's sad that after her whole career she is remembered for failing polish hymn in korea & japan world cup in 2002 ( she did an artistic interpretation of the hymn ), 
  that would an o turn , 
  that 's an add ... first result is wikipedia on dutch language, 
  that analogy does n't work here - we got a landowner who is moving his tenants around . 
  in the same way do we have right to german towns that we were given ? 
  yes - they live there . 
  so just `` i want '' scenario , should have gone with that instead of `` they have no right to it '', 
  really dumb argument , want to redraw other borders going with such logic ? 
  i wonder how far back you would go to sort out `` they have right '' problem xix century ? 
  mayby earlier ? 
   some have gone so far as to call the thirty years ' war the first world war because it involved so many countries it 's hard to call it a one war - it ' series of conflicts and only in europe . 
  also on polish wiki plc is not even labeled as involved party, 
   if you referred to the state-owned tv and radio broadcaster being under control of the government - that always was the case in poland ever since the broadcaster was created back in the interwar period , so in that regard `` they treat the freedom of press '' just like every previous government in poland did . 
  not exactly though - we had biased public media , now we got eastern style ones , that 's a pretty big change, 
  for the price of civil unrest ? 
  nope, 
  i did n't bother to look up them in wiki how they are called in english , fixed, 
  would be okeish idea if ukrainians living there wanted that, 
  hmm for me non of those would count : - enviroment ( 2008 crisis ) kind of forced the taxes - wedding - completley irrevelant for me , they hard the card avaiable and they used it in the right time , that would be plus from me i expected something like turning his back of from various organisations, 
   he made so many u-turn in his career it 's ridiculous . 
  how many turns did he make ? 
  ( serious question , i ' v not been following his career ), 
  [ sorry i could n't resist ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-252uonklhs8/u9ghkpubdhi/aaaaaaaaahs/pvegiait3im/s1600/fyfjiag.png ), 
  [ wiki article about that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_population_transfers_ ( 1944 % e2 % 80 % 9346 \\ ) ), 
  yes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_belarus#after_the_second_world_war, 
  and derpy borders, 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://wolna-polska.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/a141.jpg ) gem by zhirinovsky ? 
  there 's big polish minority in lithuania , which has been a source of some problems ( minority leader there is an asshole ) , but in general there 's quite some exchange happening in the region - polish lithuanians come here to study and work , lithuanians come to make bigass shopping couse of the price difference ; from polish side trips to vilnius , trakai , kaunas or their seaside are quite popular . 
  as for other latvia & estonia not much happens, 
  from my expirience that 's not really the case - works with simple things like introductions or greetings , but in general each interaction ended up with fast switch to english, 
  for most we do n't care lviv and vilinius are exceptions as they were important culture centers ( on the level of warsaw or kark\u00f3w ) , but that 's just sentiment left . 
  belarusians are super paranoid about us plotting to get grodno and brest back , which is pretty funny, 
  [ americanized trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqeczqjaag ) such americanized version of [ ogniem i mieczem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3aj3hpwghe ) is best imo, 
  russian disco or the old pop/jazz ( dunno what 's the genre - the songs like those by ewa dymarczyk or anna german ) , even alexander 's ensemble ( red army choir ) that performs many soviet songs is very popular, 
  i just mention that couse due to years of `` those languages are mutually intelligible '' people got false impressions, 
  did n't know that santa was a tsar, 
  the battles are well known , but there 's no grudge held against them like there is for other countries, 
  not a specialist , but i would put my money on discopolo being created on small parties in podlasie, 
  they sound similar for a not slavic speaker . 
  they got similar grammar , but there 's very little common vocabulary and very different accent , they are the slavic languages that are on the two opposites on the scale [ this map should give you an idea ] ( https://elms.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/lexicaldistanceielangs.jpg ), 
   ukrainian and polish seem the most mutually comprehensible it 's exegarated , it 's easier for us to undarstand ukrainians , bit that does n't mean we understand a lot . 
  ukrainians coming to study/work to poland learn that the hard way - they are told the that it 's easy and you can just speak ukrainian and everyone will understand . 
  as they come it turns out that it 's not so easy, 
  it 's a surname , grzegorz is the first name , but it 's not slavic - it 's latin/greek gregorius/gregorios, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_government  the territory was expanded in 1941 to include the district of galicia, 
  too late, 
  in poland we got better ones - live feeds from zoos or national parks with pandas , bisons , deers or some birds for students to waste time during exam session, 
  i would like to see the terror on her face, 
  ty sam kurwa jestes guziec / edit : ( context : scene from [ poranek kojota ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhosbvqjrpc ) movie ), 
  citizenship is the important part usualy . 
  duno if anyone cares where you live, 
  op is the guy from wedding i think, 
  yea , that 's what i mean, 
  where people eat coal and evolved to breath fumes , but can get poisoned by fresh air, 
  or russian gypsy song : [ oczy czarne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tquy3fqvcyc ) ( though not this version ofc - [ more wedding version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uckvures3bg ) ) or [ belye rozy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho0gkkpqv_u ),
