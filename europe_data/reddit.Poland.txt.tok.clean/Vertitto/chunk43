  2 days is minimum , in some regions can go up 4 eg . 
  1st day before church wedding , 2nd standard wedding , 3rd after wedding day ( called `` poprawiny '' ) and 4th for very close family to finish stuff . 
  it can be a really hard marathon sometimes . 
  most standard is just 2 days - wedding day + night and day after ( church stuff around 17-19 , wedding party to around 4-5am ) you sleep to around 10-13 when poprawiny start . 
  people drink less than they used to - they are even alcohol-less weddings , and wedding fights are becoming a thing of the past - it used to be standard attraction to have a fight on a wedding, 
   that is n't often dependent on redditors , but rather inaccurate , yet widespread base maps . 
  i do n't mind those where eg . 
  there 's no south sudan or kosovo etc. 
  just the ones that look as if they are drawn from memory - they are usualy taken from various articles/news sites, 
  google translate or wikipedia  works exellent for such short , simple search queries, 
  good way for searching such things is writing it in local languge, 
  data maps for absurd stuff where only one or all countries check the criteria atrocious colour schemes where you can not see shit random things like how many countries fit in something daily reposts of ww1 comic maps maps with super inaccurate borders what if maps how far is something from something / r/shittymapporn has a whole collection of those, 
  it 's quite hard to imagine that borders changed on monthly basis, 
  there 's lot of shit posted there on daily basis though, 
  nope , looks like some kind drinking game ( this type of contests start at midnight ) where you probably are split into two groups and part of the game is to run to the table and take the vodka shot and go back asap . 
  guy on the right seems to have slipped while trying to slow down at the table , while the one on the left is just now getting close the the table,

  aside from looking small and it looks as it 's not much of a drinking group it 's pretty accurate so far, 
  that 's punishment for drinking beer at the wedding ,

  category : sport  / edit : i imagine they set up the stream so that family living abroad and could n't come can watch . 
  i wonder how surprised they will get if this skyrockets and they get thusands of viewers / edit2 : people from the region how much does the wedding lasts there ? 
  2 , 3 days ? 
  i picked this one couse it shows fliefs/vassals coloured differently, 
  since it 's not so popular topic right-wing nutjobs wo n't even know it was a thing , 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_names#slavic_names_popular_in_poland ( m ) : wojciech , w\u0142odzimierz , lech , stanis\u0142aw , kazimierz , przemys\u0142aw girls slavic names are far less popular, 
  noone remembers [ swedes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history \\ ) #destruction _ of_the_commonwealth ) - they did as much harm as germans or russians, 
  well sorry to hear that . 
  my view is based on close friends intel ( erasums semester in rome , athens from around 2010 and 2014 ) and my father 's employees who lived in greece ( thessaloniki and athens ) for around 10 years, 
  you seem to have really hard time accepting that things exist, 
  noone really cares for 9/11 here . 
  it 's not a date people would recognise immediately, 
  mayby not exactly for spain , but they are for italy/greece . 
  laos those are mostly exact opposites of the myths , clich\u00e9s and steorotypes of that regions .

  we are not talking only about spain . 
  also not all reason need to be in all places can not say same for italy/greece, 
  - turists - beggars - crime - unemployment - waste disposal problems - percived expensive live just to name a few, 
  all the unhappy people commit suiccide, 
  do n't be fooled - the small ones are best at herding money, 
  is there even a country in europe where on average job you could support whole family ? 
  last few winters were also `` meh '' here - about 2 weeks of real winter with freezing temperatures and snow and rest was above 0 . 
  most i remember was around -35 at night . 
  tbh such +35 / -35 amplitudes are not so cool, 
  again ? 
  ah it 's just about an even from last year, 
  and that one has translation, 
  use search : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51xrjl/professor_of_uw_assaulted_in_warsaw_because_he/, 
  it was already posted https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51tof4/a_16yearold_british_girl_earns_48000_helping/, 
  each statistic has some goals and standards . 
  counting and presenting random data from which you can not say anything meaningfull is just useless trivia . 
  it also breakes it 's own goal of showing temperatures of europe, 
  yes but the same mountains shield them from eastern winds influence the costal part is not so big anyway the difference is pretty much nothing anyway, 
  and in the same time we got more influenced by eastern climate, 
  pointing out nonsense is overreacting ? 
  it renders the statistic pointless though, 
  with uk it 's understendable , but poland is surprisng to be warmer, 
  continental climate . 
  we got hotter summers , but way colder winters as well , especially when we get eastern wind, 
  you did n't get it russia got asian part counted in to the average and denmark 's greenland does not ( i would assume from the numebrs ) . 
  i did n't mention iceland in any way, 
  for russia i imagine the average is from whole country , not only europe . 
  it 's pretty pointless to use such method for them considering the ammount of barren subpolar wastelands they got . 
  also why is n't dennark treated in the same way with their greenland ? 
  2/10 for bullshit useless methodology / edit ; showing average for few cities would be way better, 
   and pretty awful too . 
  what heresy is that ? 
  that 's the best flavour, 
  3city , poland - [ guide ] ( http://guide.trojmiasto.pl/ ), 
  euros as currency , people or just anything with europe ? 
  that 's also my theory, 
  there are : sweden , finland , poland , germany ... 
  yea as i mentioned - they used wrong shade of red and white, 
  mayby there is no country between them, 
  no you got confused , just look at sub map, 
  is n't everywhere in liechtenstein just 20min walk from the border ? 
  either cheese / chocolate / salt depends what kind of snack, 
  well duh we ' v learnt some things while colonising your islands .

  northen sea will be ours !, 
  it 's just a funny jab at steorotypes , not serious statement, 
  tl ; dr : british/americans suck at cooking , any flour is good enough for them, 
  yea it 's not pure white , but greyish and red is also different shade [ pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rzymdno.jpg ) / edit : that 's just technical thing , in general it 's just white and red, 
  wow that 's a nice start, 
  especially in poland or baltics , 
  having full emplyoment is different from having it as a goal . 
  eg when having it as a goal investing becomes pointless and just a problem to achieving the goal it 's nothing more that populist empty statement, 
   the goal is full employment that is very dumb goal, 
  / r/europemeta imo they are cool, 
  from few days ago https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/503s9q/poland_backs_francogerman_european_security/ in big tl ; dr poland is just against : - refugee quotas - unrestricted entry to eu - joining eurozone - eu where one country rules, 
  just search on yt eg . 
  [ this channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jti6dn0nb2u ), 
   while euroscepticism is significant among polish could we stop with this bullshit myth already ? 
  different link , but the same thing, 
  kind of but not exactly it 's rational to avoid shitty neighbourhoods , not ethnic minority ones ( some overlap ofc ), 
  mayby they do n't see a difference and better safe than sorry,
