  ~ ~ so you seen the thread been deleted and you decided to repost again gj ~ ~ ~ ~ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51ly78/air_chinas_inflight_magazine_in_racism_storm/~~ / edit : my bad seems one was posted right after another, 
  upvote just to see someone make 3 page long answer  / edit : however onion is also fine, 
  missleading title - women 's world champion kudos anyway, 
  wow bia\u0142ystok is included and cities like wroc\u0142aw and poznan not ? 
  that 's weird, 
  get out of your bubble please, 
  wow that 's pretty hardcore, 
  the problem is they did not mention the neighbourhoods , but national/race groups, 
  i got exact opposite attitude - i find that dialect/language very irritating . 
  probably due to watching bercik - i freaking hated his shows, 
  actualy it is exeggerated as fuck `` cracow 's worst reaches chinese big city standard '' would be accurate way to put it, 
   wind/solar not really vaiable aside from being a small suplement, 
  that 's way hyperbolised, 
   atomic we got pretty unlucky . 
  whenever we were about to build it something happened when we were about to build one back the day - charnobyl happened , later transformation , later fukushima, 
  you may have failed to post the link, 
   we got no oil , no gas we got oil and gas , we just do n't have enough of it *, 
  pretty old do n't you think ? 
  pirating legacy lives on, 
  with ukraine it 's more of ukrainian 's gov fault though, 
  never played gta ? 
  remember there 's at least one story behind each sign, 
  who does n't ? 
  i know it 's roughly the same , but it matters who 's ahead , 
  wait hungary has more gdp per capita ? 
  ohhh i though we were ahead, 
  [ more brexit circlejerk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adl7o6dwqss ), 
  i wonder if they know about it , 
  it 's not from gov though , gov just followed the trend, 
  oh oh and memes : - [ mlg dank meme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mulwslummau ) - [ duda-hime meme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztuyxzsw6re ), 
  to be exact : kolega is guy friend kole\u017canka is girl friend, 
  someone wants a free trip to uk really badly, 
  do you mayby know if the script is based on something ? 
  i would seriously watched that . 
  it looks a bit cheesy from the trailers , but i wonder how the end product will stand compared to the american hero movies, 
  for the most part it 's imaginary, 
  there 's even more tricks like reginstering ( also used for vat tricks ) multiple companies in one room under some drunk joe 's name who agreed to sign some papers for 0,7 l, 
  already here https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zongy/polands_standard_of_living_rises_fast/, 
  already here https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/50mlds/romanians_who_return_to_their_country_could/, 
  the title makes it sound as if france was some kind of warzone, 
  well if it 's just like op says in post below that it will be handled in the same way as `` start our business '' eu funds then lot of it will get wasted . 
  in poland we had many `` ghost companies '' usually from it sectors that employed 1-2 students for minimum wage that vanished as soon as funding or new firm tax/insurence benefits ended i 'm not a fan of state giving raw money to random people, 
  except it 's done by the state , not private funds, 
  oh this is a pretty bad idea do they have anything to prevent moneyloundring and schemes aimed at sucking the money ? 
  the original one with [ jews running israel ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pwyxczl.jpg ) is much better, 
   you have to accept the fact that you may be a victim of crime in life and it 's not always because you are x , y or z. which is the part you get confused at . 
  there are situations when the crime is couse of you are x , y or z and there are those that are not . 
  mentioning 1st part does n't negate 2nd, 
  you fuse multiple things into one making a big generalisation, 
   if eastern europeans want to bring their victim culture and inferiority complexes what the fuck ? 
  link ? 
  i guess you had to much tv, 
  i wonder if they took different meaning of `` friend '' into account / edit : example on polish `` friend '' is `` przyjaciel '' , but in use ( aside from friend as an ally ) `` przyjaciel '' is for english `` best friend '' , wheras simple `` friend '' would be `` kolega '' or `` znajomy '' ( collegue or acquaintance ), 
  couse there 's nothing entertaining in another `` who got 1st place this time norway or sweden ? '', 
  un expected things are entertaining, 
  i mean - wiki articles could at least be consistent, 
   joukowsky : russian aerodynamicist . 
  it 's really weird when the transform is written differently from his name on wiki joukowsky vs zhukovsky, 
  the stats on the book is number of book stores in poland in thousands eu average = 32 %, 
  from not so internationally known : [ ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignacy_%c5%81ukasiewicz ) ( pretty much kickstarted oil industry ), 
  that was really nice , expected another cringy hijacked polandball-like thing, 
  pretty much, 
   astrology you mean astronomy . 
  astrology is the horoscope bullshit , while astronomy is science of celestial objects and space you can write about [ european space agency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_space_agency ) . 
  from sports you could cover disciplies popular in various countries or if you want more history into it : [ hema ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_european_martial_arts ) movement, 
  very close actually, 
  really ? 
  it 's pretty often mentioned , there were even few weaves when 5-6 post of front were about it, 
   t 's as right as the current republican party in the ongoing presidential elections in the us . 
  it 's as socialist as the left side of us as well . 
  us is not the best example, 
  not only on this subs - pretty much in any medium, 
  you did n't mention anything he represents though, 
  what exactly does he represent ? 
  it 's just dumb title like there were with calling pis `` far-right '' or is it actually true ? 
  / edit : why the downvotes ? 
  [ this is pretty standard one in poland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zzohx/my_first_major_culture_shock_visiting_lithuania/d703ljy ) - medium thin , but not too crunchy, 
  which is more common ? 
  just look at [ glorious pizza in poland ] ( https://youtu.be/ee2ezgevwli?t=1m46s ) admired by some russian turists . 
  no but seriously you always get some souce here - garlic and tomatoe souce are two most popular , you get them in small containers, 
  you mean you eat pizza without any souce ? 
   why would you need to dip the pizza in a sauce ?!, 
  you do n't dip , you just put and spread it on pizza, 
   poland ? 
  ketchup is named solve all things spice i know people who even put ketchup on tomatoes ( seriously ), 
  so normal ? 
  thin crust is pretty much only italian thing i think, 
  yeah that crust looks really weird, 
  look at us , 
  aka i do n't really want to move , i like things as they are , 
  probably slovenia - slow , peacefull country got both mountains and a sea that is not sad baltic, 
  along with birth rate it 's the saddest thing about poland / edit : also that polish-czech border , lol, 
  and russian empire, 
  or an ancient, 
  to help with making it more trust worthy in population eyes ? 
  not really . 
  eu would imo have to transform into a country so that people knew and see the actions of the organ better . 
  so imo the problem lies more in the commission 's role rather than in the way representatives are appointed, 
  yea but it is n't just that it 's imperfect - it 's a change for changes sake that does n't improve on anything, 
  and you think direct democracy would halp ?
