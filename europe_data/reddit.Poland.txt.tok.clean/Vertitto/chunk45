   silly you it 's needs to be super popular and charismatic person to be able to pull such thing on his own . 
   direct democracy would help with that and how is that supposed to help ? 
  no we got elections for president and for prime minister ( pm is traditionally the person who is the face of parliamentary elections for the party ), 
  those questions are racist as fuck, 
  slowpoke article i expected it to be about how cdproject 's capitalization overtakes polish energy companies or something . 
  turns out it 's just article by some guy who has been living under a rock for quite some time, 
  well egypt existed before the world itself , 
   the lands were then controlled by the romans wait was n't the croatia we are talking about in region around todays czech , slovak , hungary , ukraine , russia , poland ? 
  ( [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/slavic_peoples_6th_century_historical_map.jpg ) ) the legend you posted looks like modern rendering with today 's croatia location, 
  that comes in weaves, 
  no harm can touch them now , but have they checked if planets have arranged in a right way though ? 
   russia can not into slavic brotherhood . 
  rus * tl , dr for westerners : ru\u015b is a region/entity from which few nations emarged : 3 big ones - russians , belarusians , ukrainians and smaller ones like eg . 
  this is why you will hear ( mostly russians ) saying they are sister nations or even one nation split into multiple countries, 
  depends on various things like : - percived intention - context - voice tone  does that mean it 's not an insult to call a gay person ` faggot ' ? 
  if it said as friendly banter, 
  i would take it as so, 
  [ enjoy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll_gchosk4c ), 
   you implied you did that , not me i simply said what can be an insult , you added some story to it, 
  so would be even simple `` hey you '', 
  wow , the university is really impressing, 
  at best it will be a mockery , it 's hard to make it possitive, 
  where did i say that ? 
  what the hell ? 
  calling someone something they are not will always be an insult, 
  i 'm just saying they at least they left some possitive effects, 
  i 'm from \u0141om\u017ca and my grandparents live in jankowo near nowogr\u00f3d, 
   eastern poland south eastern *, 
   excepts for their birth rate and innovation indicators, 
  last one at least did something , we will see what pis achieves . 
  so far they have been busy detering investors and ruining companies, 
  also polish nobility liked ottoman style , which resulted in ornamented sabres ( karabela : [ 1 ] ( http://www.muzeumwp.pl/image/szabla_karabela.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.szablakarabela.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dsc_5721-1024x335.jpg ) or [ 3 ] ( http://imgur.com/klzljbl ) while in western europe smallswords/rapiers were in fashion ) and [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/stanislaw_antoni_szczuka_ ( 1652_1654-1710 \\ ) . jpg ) ( other pics : [ 1 ] ( http://www.ekomod.pl/files/zupany%20026.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.ekomod.pl/files/kontusze%20czapki%20008.jpg ) or [ 3 ] ( http://imgur.com/fxj9dqz ) ) our nobility costume, 
   trgovina this is recognisable, 
  we are not saying it 's not true , but the article is written as some advert trying to say something without saying anything, 
  yea no data , no nothing just `` polan so gut '', 
  funny enough - not really . 
  ottomans got remebered as ones who refused to recognise partitions of polan, 
  often you got similar problems , but do n't share the border long enough to create any tensions, 
   they are mutually exclusive in western europe as well for the most part there just are n't many parties with such combination , not that it 's mutually exclusive, 
  reigning queen - does n't that imply a queen out of necessity eg . 
  becouse the king dies or she was in the line of succession ? 
  we had a pretty weird system where most of the kings were elected ( especially in her times where it was something inbetween succession and election ), 
  conservative and socialist are not possitions that exclude one another , it 's not us, 
  our little green men got set up in iceland , ireland , norway and now uk , only wait till protests start buhahahah, 
  for me most special thing about her is that she was a king * ( not a queen and at very young age at that plus she was n't given a regent despite her young age ) . 
  never noticed the saint aspect being brought up that much , especially compared to other saints like jp2 , stanislaus kostka , andrew bobola , faustina kowalska or maximilian kolbe / edit : * to explain king - person who gets coronated ( nearly always a male ) queen - wife of the king when i think about it it 's just like with today 's presidency - standard president ( king ) and 1st lady ( queen ) due to the presidents were in high majority males, 
  most known figure would be [ j\u00f3zef bem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_bem ), 
  we were even one country twice - [ union of hungary and poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_hungary_and_poland ) / edit : well 3 times if you include austro-hungary participation in the partitions , but that does n't count, 
  polish version : `` ci dam dielektem po g\u0142owie '' nearly identical , 
  if you looked at it - part of them is hungary anyway and the other speaks just `` a dialect '' of polish ; ), 
  [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) people generally do n't know the reasons - you can see it as a possitive steorotype that you learn through the rhyme since you are a little kid, 
  totally the same thing  also  it 's not child labour because children are allowed to work starting at the age of 14 in myanmar is just dumb . 
  i dunno how can anyone say that with straight face, 
  lol i love the logic, 
  for a untrained eye most folk costumes from the region look the same - like for me  [ map with polish folk costumes ] ( http://mazowsze.waw.pl/fotki/image/mapapol.jpg ) or [ another one ] ( http://culture.pl/sites/default/files/images/imported/taniec/inne/stroje_ludowe/mapa22.jpg ) ( dunno how accurate it is ), 
  no , `` xcity is best city in something '' , `` xcity won something '' `` x is capital of culture for this year '' and so on, 
  majority of threads like that get downvoted here, 
   first it was his bias , now it 's the / new section ... two completley different things, 
  you do n't follow the / new section to often , do you ? 
  and for france , poland , turkey , bulgaria , romania , hungary , germany , greece , spain , italy , russia etc, 
  that was before the edit, 
  it 's your bias not the sub, 
  as if it was surprising, 
  christians or jews women in arab/persian countries . 
  as for women headwear in general it 's was/is tradition in many cultures , [ traditional polish costume ] ( http://www.polskiekrajobrazy.pl/images/stories/big/55815581csc_01.jpg ) . 
  such head scarfs were very common not so long ago, 
  i do n't think it 's the same thing - hijabs is more of traditional thing , not purely religious, 
  not surprising considering continent 's history, 
  i do n't think there 's any . 
  you can not however hold your phone and talk/sms while driving - that costs 500 pln + 5penalty points . 
  having it on the phone holder for gps or talking on speaker is ok, 
  you start a vicious circle when you have to have a gun couse the criminal is now expected to have one , you got accidents with children playing with the gun , you got drunk fights that escalate to shotings , depressed teens with school shootings , more aggressive police that can not risk opponent reaching for gun etc. 
  all that for false sense of security, 
  for one case being usefull there are 30 of missuse , is it really worth it ? 
  i guess i will never understand how can people think it 's safer when people got free access to guns, 
  noble quest , i hope it wo n't get sent to / r/askeurope, 
  some context ? 
  i do n't have anything against being progressive nor conservative , this argument is just a blunt strawman, 
  that 's the conservative absurdly hyperbolical boundry pushing, 
  people just confuse administrative marrige and religious one, 
  so no change ? 
  you assume uk will leave within a 20 years window ? 
  bold poland will sooner adopt euro, 
  in a very tl ; dr it 's mainly a filter for legislature ----------------------- in some more detail : - called senat - consists of 100 senators ( lower house - sejm has 460 ) - is organised into : marshal of the senate , committees , presidium of the senate ( marshal + vice marshals ) and the council of seniors ( like previous + represenatives of senate clubs ) and clubs ( aka parties ) - elections every 4 years along with sejm , single-member constituency ( for sejm it 's proportional ) - to be a senator you need to be 30 + ( for sejm you need only 21 , president 35 ) , plus all the standard stuff like not having criminal record , being citizen etc - can propose bills - can make amendments to sejm 's bills - dis/approves sejm 's bills ( if disapproved then it lands in sejm again and require bigger vote treshhold to be passed ) - greenlights referendums - can propose referendum - greenlights various state positions - appointments few state possitions - can send bills to constitutional court - along with sejm greenlights international agreements ---------------------------------- some parties wanted to disolve it and have just one house parlament claiming senat is pointless and just drains money , but that never was any serious movement, 
  but then it would be weird to have a tournaments with only ~ 3 teams participating : ), 
  posts or threads ? 
  to be precise : it 's school 's banner not national flag, 
  you are pretty late on that, 
  those are formal though , for every day we had jumper-like material vests ( they were very light though ) with school emblem - something [ like this ] ( http://www.duduta.co.za/media/catalog/men_sweaters/men-v-neck-sleeveless-sweater-vest-5.jpg ), 
  it does n't help much with social class segregation segregation though, 
  it was reintroduced some time ago in poland and few years later they backed out of it . 
  i thought it was cool . 
  can not find picture of those , but [ here 's formal one ] ( https://d-pt.ppstatic.pl/k/r/1/73/80/55c1bf49d86a5_o.jpg?1442685684 ) from gimnazjum i went to, 
  / r/italy / r/iwantout, 
  never watched a full match , only some short highlight to look up what it is , i do n't really have opinion about it, 
  well duh , it 's not a thing anywhere else , 
  so that 's why people started to have pigs or miniature cows for pets, 
  in ex block eastern countries , especially russia, 
   there was so many bs about doped russians , cheating russians , there was cold war amount of dirt poured on our athletes well most of it was coused by the russian sport federation itself, 
   like ussr did back then just like most other countries in ussr ( end eastern block in general ) sport and education were/are highly valued,
