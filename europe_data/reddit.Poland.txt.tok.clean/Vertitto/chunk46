   typical europe  happens in few countries, 
  i do n't get the point of it - why would not eligible person get citizenship in the first place then ? 
  that looks like law getting derailed, 
  swimming with milion ( 17 per sex ) of disciplines . 
  lets say you got a good man and women swimmers and they alone can make 26 medals ( i did n't count relays and marathon ) ), 
   `` natural-born citizen '' requirement what would that even mean ? 
  you got super fatalistic way of thinking, 
   that eastern europe will become their next destination of choice not us or canada ? 
  then you look at living standards and feel happy with where you are + you can always go for a trip there, 
  youtube, 
  open yt and watch some travel blogs, 
  that depends what kind of business you want, 
  so is bosnia and serbia, 
  freedom of religion , not from religion, 
  well so exactly same as people in coma  the ones in which we allow abortion `` we '' means who ? 
  abortion is legal is different stages depending on country  a human hair also contains all of the genetic material that makes up a person except it lacks the `` autorun program '' , which is the key element, 
  it 's not ridiculous ( unless you are religious ) - the `` goo '' just gets bigger, 
  there was thread about that few hours ago here it is : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4yqd3d/moscow_airport_shop_sells_model_kalashnikov_guns/, 
  well yes , was not clear enough - my point was that you can not claim one gamete to be a human, 
  how about killing dozen of patients in coma ? 
  you also find it morally ok ? 
  it 's not that they are hard to overcome , but it needs more time and patience than in other countries - ( depends on what you want t do ofc ) you need to visit multiple institutions , that are often not specially cooperative ( getting better though ) , lot of paperwork and hiring costs are pretty high - mainly due to obligatory zus insurence that you need to pay regardless if you got income, 
  i have an impression from news/tv that killing a pregnant woman has far worse repercussions that killing a `` normal '' person, 
  well in some way yes, 
  how is it considered anyway ? 
  not really - it 's genetics that defines you , sperm/egg has only half of it, 
   would you think one could live decently in poland for a few years without learning polish ? 
  in big cities like warsaw , krak\u00f3w or 3city , yes, 
   i think lots of poles moved abroad for high wages and it 's generally cheaper , easier and faster to set up and carry on with your enterprise in western countries, 
  this vid is from 2011 [ proof ] ( https://youtu.be/22yluplo0gw?t=9m10s ) ( they say the stadium is nearly ready for the upcoming euro next year ; euro was in 2012 ), 
   1 depeds on arbitral line you put on a process  a fetus ca n't survive on its own nor can little kids, 
  couse they got half the genetic material needed, 
  not directly , but may be connected : for one seeing the religious civil wars in the west and having multireligious society [ warsaw confederation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_confederation ) was sign up so that such purges can not occour, 
  you need to be very ignorant on the matter not to see it being problematic, 
  most countries send their delegations, 
  polan master hacker is [ 2nd right after china ] ( http://stats.ioinformatics.org/countries/?sort=total_desc ) in the general ranking ( sadly not in golds ), 
  expected full electric cars , not hybrids, 
  from polish ones there 's ( not still running though ) - [ czas honoru ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czas_honoru ) ( 8,2 / 10 on imbd , war story , [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxz2-pajdse ) , ) or - [ anna german ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2729414/ ) ( 8,3 / 10 on imbd , biograpahical series about polish vocalist , [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fel7od-ugem ) ) worth to watch even only for songs dunno if you can find it with subs/lector , for anna german you may find russian , ukrainian or croatian versions, 
  really cool , sme thing was/is done in poland , though we got mroe abstract designs , i like the ukrainian one much better examples : [ \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haddsoymgqe ) ; [ gda\u0144sk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2atlis_4wg ) ; [ gda\u0144sk zaspa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfczs7ucdoe ) commie block here are generally painted in pastel colors [ like here ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@54.4564538,18.5332792,3a,75y,45.36h,92.73t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smouul_0cqptr2ysg7uw3uw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) or [ here ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@53.1690177,22.067975,3a,75y,163.98h,89.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snq7lebj_pl1km5i_wrnbig!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ), 
  better start learning polish and prepare to meet your polish overlords , buhahha, 
  you could get vinegar : ), 
  a one that suits his narrative at a given time, 
  not country specific slavic-type beauty - very femine , delicate face featuers , wide variety of hair colour and body shapes , culturally `` pressured '' to look good, 
  we got [ kupala night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kupala_night ) , but it 's not a free day, 
  that 's why the asterisk instead of full qualification, 
  i come from podlasie ( \u0141om\u017ca , spent ot of time in suwa\u0142ki / stary folwark and bia\u0142ystok ) - only old people from bia\u0142ystok got some accent that would mayby qulify for that , but being only around students you wo n't hear it, 
  [ totaly attainable ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6e/09/68/6e0968f9c1edffad3044f5e30311d1f0.jpg ), 
  marocco in spain also deserves and asterisk as it 's a direct neighbour, 
  there 's seriously a region where there 's still hearable difference in everyday use ? 
   distinguish - ed *, 
  do you tend forget about umlauts ? 
  ; ) ( in informal written languge polish `` special signs '' get often omitted - eg . 
  instead of `` p\u00f3\u0142noc '' people write `` polnoc '' ), 
  not worse than people with two names, 
   1 we would have shit tone of dashed letters , we already got many : \u0105 , \u0119 , \u017c , \u017a , \u0107 , \u0144 , \u015b , \u0142 , \u00f3  drz not a trigraph , we got only one trigraph : `` dzi ''  case in point : all the words starting with the `` prz '' cluster are pronounced as if they were starting with `` psz '' instead it 's the one example there is of this i belive , and even then saying `` prz '' is also ok  third that 's just foreigners not hearing sounds , not lack of difference same sounding letters are : \u00f3 = u , rz = \u017c and ch = h, 
  it 's funny as it 's pretty much foreign words put into polish grammar, 
  judging from my handwriting the dashes and dots golore would make my writing even more unreadable, 
  english and germans seem to be the ones with most problem learning teh lang from my expirience with erasmus people, 
  you can not change titles anyway what would you expect to change ? 
  brexit is n't happening yet , even companies do n't seem to be rushing the idea either, 
  not my fault it 's inaccurate, 
   tbh grzegorz brzeczysczykiewicz is hard to pronounce even for a native speaker not really, 
  it 's luck / happy happiness would be `` szcz\u0119\u015bliwo\u015b\u0107 '' ( not often used outside subjects like philosophy ) , `` szcz\u0119\u015bcie '' can also work , but needs context, 
  especially in disciplines where the audience is supposed to be quited for most of the time, 
  look up japan who has been having over 200 for quite some time, 
  especially for eestii ; ), 
  that depends if you are willing to pay so much and how crisis proff your economy is . 
  if the ~ 100 % is already considered a big burden , then it may be hard times if big crisis hits, 
  http://www.debtclocks.eu/public-debt-and-budget-deficits-comparison-of-the-eu-member-states.html portgual : 128 % gdp italy : 132 % greece : 181 % cyprus 105 % belgium 106 % eurozone : 92 % [ global scale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_debt ) ( wiki , not as accurate as the link above ), 
  they do n't ? 
  imagine that we have - ukrainians , about whom we are really happy, 
  depends on the discipline - it wouldbe true for categories like atheletics or weight lifting , but untrue for most bracketsystem competitions, 
   of course the russians are organised since military service is still mandatory ( depending on the case ) in russia we do n't have military service any more and our football hooligans are also pretty organised, 
  that 's pretty old, 
  but with bad perspective, 
  [ eli5 : britain is officially leaving europe . 
  where are they going to go/how hard is it to move an island ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/4pn0p7/eli5_britain_is_officially_leaving_europe_where/ ), 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dumka_ ( musical_genre \\ ) ) [ polish wiki ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/dumka ), 
  oh indeed , never paid attention to it . 
  it was only a red day on the calendar for me, 
  to add two polish ukrainian related songs in ukrainian : - [ hej soko\u0142y ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qguw3xxsk ) ( hey falkons ! ), 
  [ polish version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qrytisrni0 ) ; more [ original folk version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqvqmrmlh14 ) - [ dumka na dwa serca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg28nydhf30 ) ( dumka for two hearts ; dumka is a kind of ukrainian ballad ) [ polish version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcxakhwsl6o ), 
  same in poland, 
  in poland it 's half religious and half secular holiday : - religious : the assumption of the virgin mary - secular : armed forces day celebration ( military parades ) & [ battle of warsaw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_ ( 1920 \\ ) ) ( the one mentioned in another thread ), 
  well duh captain obvious . 
  first and foremost it 's an outfit and it can be discussed separately from the shitty culture , but that seems to be over some people 's head, 
  that 's how parties work . 
  very rarely it 's given up to personal opinion of deputes, 
  that 's pretty rare opinion  warsaw has one of the most beautiful stare miasto i have ever seen also dunno if you know it 's not so old - it was nearly completly destroyed after ww2 and rebuild after from old plans and pictures . 
  it works as a guiding point/case study for architects to how rebuild such city segments ( i remember there was some special conferences-seminars regarding that for architects from war-torn middle eastern countries who may be given similar task in their countries ), 
  it 's part of [ polish -- soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) , which is crucial to understand soviet russia 's `` noble idea to protect us from nazis '' ; there was also [ polish-lithuanian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_war ) during that time small writeup : 1919 , soviets want to spread the revolution westwards trying to use the after ww1 shitfest . 
  we got two main sides : polish ( anti-communist block with ukraine and belarus ) vs soviet ( soviet russia led communists block with communist supporters from ukraine and belarus ) . 
  at first polish side leads getting past mi\u0144sk and kiev ( [ hurrey polan map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/pbw_june_1920.png/1280px-pbw_june_1920.png ) ) , soviets get their shit together push the front to warsaw ( [ sad polan map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/pbw_august_1920.png/1280px-pbw_august_1920.png ) ) , where they get rekt and peace is signed in riga in 1921 . 
  result : poland wins , gets some land , cash and some other stuff , ukraine and belarus get split and mostly taken by the soviets, 
  even better - they changed the hq of communist party to a stock exchange ; ), 
  if you want to see some logic in it , you look at it as a wetsuit ( the ones used for watersports ) ( a bit stretched analogy , but always something ), 
  or becosue it 's something like 4th repost of the article, 
  wow that 's pretty intense,
