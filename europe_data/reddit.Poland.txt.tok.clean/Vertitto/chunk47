  i was watching it live and was really surprised that warsaw can look like that, 
  [ heli shots from tour de pologne ' 15 ] ( https://youtu.be/t-lxwwhmwho?t=6m53s ) ( ~ 6min54s - 8min30s ) has even better shoot as it also gets the old town, 
  those can be polish related things transalted into english or more unique name though or simple things like mentioned z\u0142ota44 , rondo 1 or q22 . 
  just cut the `` skyliner , liberty tower , city tower , oxford tower '' types that sound like cheesy skyscreapers names from some game or series, 
  which is much better name than the examples i gave, 
  yes - prive sector, 
  pretty weird to go by rooms instead of sqm, 
  my beef with them is that they are given english names - towers , centers , spires ( and unimaginative at that - skyliner , liberty tower , city tower , oxford tower , warsaw spire etc ), 
  along with lviv and vilinus just across the border ; ) we stil got towns like gda\u0144sk , sopot , toru\u0144 , lublin , wroc\u0142aw , bydgoszcz or zamo\u015b\u0107, 
  there are some [ vids and photographs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pre+war+warsaw ) ( some got coloured ) ------------------------------------------------- [ pre war saxon palace ( square ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/warsaw-pilsudski-square-1900s.jpg ) and [ nowdays ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@52.2412419,21.0135349,3a,75y,257.25h,73.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjs5nyoleciesp5ksd1y5hw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) is a place i would love they rebuilt ( [ one of the designs ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/warszawa/images/b/b1/nowy_plac_pi%c5%82sudskiego.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070204135938 ) ),

  does n't matter how long ago it ended as long as it lost validity, 
   it does n't really fit any classification how so ? 
  expected some new photos , not the old reposts, 
  having a fact in a bush of bullshit is usually called propaganda, 
   btw we dont sugar our water , we are not the us what the fuck ? 
  someone sugars water ? 
  the exact same can be told about countries from eastern block that joined eu and those who did n't, 
  have you actually been in the countries in question or learnt some history of the region ( i mean aside from ww2 ) ? 
  serious question , no intention of making fun ; just want to get some outline of your possition, 
  the differences between v4 and rus countries are far bigger than between germanic countries and v4 though, 
  going by cold war division is completely pointless though - it does n't convey any usefull information - it 's straight up wrong on many levels from geographical to cultural . 
  only thing it accomplishes is picturing a slim historical period and is a storotype vehicle for ignorant people . 
  going by a division similar to shown on the map you got more accurate portrayal of region . 
  best way is imo just calling regions v4 or baltics, 
  technically center is somewhere between lithuania , poland and belarus, 
   besides , hungary and slovakia and poland are definitely eastern european in culture . 
  i doubt you know anything about them then, 
  except it is n't ... 
  that may be reasonable if you know russia only as a big blob on a map from ww2 onwards, 
  best there is on the matter though ( there was one with gradient instead of lines , which was a bit better ) - after all it is broad brush generalisation of regions, 
  cold war divide makes as much sense nowdays as rome - barbarians divide, 
  n.koreas have been cought working for some company not so long ago ( i believe it 's what he 's talking about ), 
   you refuse to fulfill the terms and conditions which ones ? 
   the contribution to eu is negative in eastern countries this is the only fact you mentioned . 
  rest is somewhere between propaganda , lies , missinformation, 
   the contribution to eu is negative in eastern countries , western countries literally lose money on eu . 
  it 's pretty sad that you are not even awere how dumb this statement is, 
  quality economy knowladge, 
  from outside mayby , keep in mind it 's often just a form of pr from inside it does n't look so good and it 's not so much due to pis . 
  we got major problems that no party even wants to tackle seriously - budget inefficiency , healthcare , overblown burocracy , worker unions in state owned companies , ** very low innovation indicators ** , ** demographic & pension problems ** , stock exchange is losing investors and so on . 
  we are in a fragile state that it 's called europe 's assembly line ( similar like other v4 countries ) with little signs of getting over it, 
  no question about that , from 90 ' poland was changing as if it was different country each ~ 7 years . 
  my aunt , that lives in us and visits in such intervals , is always amazed how much has changed, 
  rude ? 
  better, 
  this is not how polish mindest works , you need to find something bad about it, 
  well duh , it 's just very rare, 
  and in typical polish fashion i must add : `` and are still nowhere close to their western neighbours '', 
  strangely i never heard it in poland, 
  tech uni students especially can get a very good `` pay '' from grants and other bonuses, 
  czechoslovakia-like breakup would be good, 
   how many of your friends have one of those `` security-systems '' ? 
  quite a few , especially in blocks . 
  they were mostly installed in early 2000 though the difference is mainly that westerners feel safer than the stats would suggest , while in poland it 's reversed . 
  on top of that people got their steorotypes , which results in surprise, 
  not exactly , despite low crimes people are afraid to leave house or car open , instal ton of weird safty locks , alarms etc just in case couse `` 10 years ago neighbour got robbed '', 
  from their sites : for strzelec it says you need to have polish citizenship , 16 + and no criminal record for legia akademicka it 's similar : 18 + , no criminal record , polish citizenship , good physical and mental condition ( there are some fitness tests ) and an ad&d insurence they both work closely with army, 
   it is like 30 % which is quite a few, 
  already on the front page, 
  you can swim in rivers/lakes/swimming pools . 
  sea is actually worst thing to swim in, 
  usually various small local military enthusiast hobbyist groups , they are not very visible unless you search for them from bigger ones there 's eg . 
  people started to get be suspicious after georgia , then smolensk crash ( there are quite few people believing it was russian assasination ) . 
  ukraine was the breaking point when many people started signing up for various forms of paramilitary - from simple shooting lessons to making in-case scenarios for towns if russia attacked . 
  ( especially in eastern poland ) it 's not something popular , but it 's a change from `` close to non interest '' to `` you can meet people doing that '', 
  any bank should do it for you, 
  most importantly : fencing / edit : as he is going for medal : [ go go szilagyi !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfe4wvgamk0 ), 
  dunno for irish , but german is quite consistent, 
   you literally read things like they 're written , one letter = one sound like pretty much all european languages aside from french and english that did n't get the memo of how alphabet works, 
  depends on the region mayby . 
  around my regions ( podlasie ) it was french that either unpopular or not available, 
  availability of russian is rare ? 
   i did n't realize you poles were all promised to get the perfect job . 
  it 's the exact opposite . 
  there 's not enough jobs to chose from , since the law, 
   they can get a job which requires them to work day x or get a job that does n't fairy land with limitless jobs you can chose from ? 
  employees do n't usually hava freedom to pick like that, 
  big 3 of fencing stand firmly - how close is russia to them ? 
  ( or most of it was ussr ? ), 
  it 's way easier though to organise/plan various family ( or general events ) activities this way though, 
  sunday ( and to less extent saturday ) is just a traditionally free day in western world , reason does n't have to be religious, 
  it works as a worker union law that prevents employers from abusing their possition, 
  it 's usually a law that concerns bigger employers , while leaves small ones alone ( in poland we had/have a rule that shop can be open only if it 's the owners who are working + some asterisks ), 
  for people to have time with family/day off, 
  there 's always contradicting stats coming from germany for this ( from different sources ) - from one germany over produces electricity to the point they have to sell it , from other they got the highest prices . 
  is there a fake/missleading data or germany has some price fixing problem ? 
  why sweden is higher ranked than polan ? 
  that 's the story for me, 
  the situation is pretty much same for both , i dunno what you mean, 
  in general borders are very sketchy to say the least, 
  geography it 's actually yes - center is somewhere around belarus/lithuania ( people are not awere how big ukriane and european russia are ; [ maps centered around belarus ] ( https://www.biketours.com/photos/btc1511_map_graphic_europe.png ) give better perspective than the usually used maps ), 
   tsarigrad that does n't exist in polish . 
  looks like another variation of k\u00f6nigsberg, 
  3 little countries + russian rebelious republics , hurrey !, 
  that description matches more to `` city guard '' ( or however it would be called in english ) . 
  as a matter of fact i wonder how low opinion they got, 
  one may say he is an expert ; ), 
   in germany over 90 % is denied asylum do n't they stay in germany anyway ?
