  retarded sweden strikes again, 
  polan needs those !, 
  dumb title though, 
  reddit circlejerks are pretty random, 
  what are the other 4 countries ? 
  also hard to combine poland with us and canada here . 
  it 's us , canada and others, 
  what is a definition of being an european country for you then ? 
  this may be source of the disagreement, 
  when you fuse culturally . 
  it 's not about how long the entity is there , but if it has enough common things with others . 
  no , did i say religion is the only factor ? 
  by giving a question with an pretty obvious answer ? 
  what are you biases about me exactly ? 
  in terms of culture , which is the main subject of the discussion tree - easiest ( copout ) answer - religion, 
  [ according to wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonial_empire ) ottoman empire was a colonial empire . 
  colonial does n't have to include slavery, 
  there are like 20 cities that are considered `` party capital of europe '', 
  i guess you did n't get the argument then . 
  when boiled down to it 's core or trying to generalise to put in some category it 's more natural to place ottoman empire into middle eastern than european box . 
   just like poland is considered `` eastern '' in those games eastern euopean if something ; that 's completley beside the point however, 
  polan and t\u00fcrkiye stronk !, 
  will rule the world with space lazers well it 's very long term prediction so it 's bout to be surprising from today 's pov, 
  some tl ; dr of what exactly happened ? 
  to bad religion resonates through the every cultural aspect ( from architecture to social values ) . 
  turkey has aspects that can be counted as european ( it 's at the cultural border after all , it 's not black and white scenario ) , but they are imo insufficient . 
  / edit : take games like civilization series or basic books for children that present various cultures ( they are good as they try to bring complex things to its core ) - where do you believe turkey suits better ? 
  would n't it be weird if it had been given euopean themes instead of middleastern , which it usually gets ? 
  the links with middleeastern culture are way stronger though, 
  no , not like huns of hungary, 
  was middleeastern power that had influence in europe is more accurate way to put this . 
  it 's a reversed russia case, 
  i did n't say it has n't got long history in europe or did n't influence europe . 
  i said it was never part of it ( it being the european culture ) - it was an outside force that was crawling in and out, 
  who is `` they '' ? 
  people argue here why caucasus is on the sub map , while georgia and armenia get a pass , problems start with azerbaijan, 
  wrong sub, 
   and we all know turkey has shared a long history in european affairs like mongols they were always the outside force coming to europe , not part of it, 
  some people are just more used to kk, 
  not really, 
  so is paprica , which is a holy food of hungary, 
  wrong sub though, 
  in a big very big tl ; dr : belarus , russia and ukraine are sister nations that got their roots in kievan ru\u015b . 
  common denominators : east slavic language , christian orthodox faith , cyrilic alphabet , vodka and potatoe, 
  would be technically correct if they left after liberation, 
  that 's close to irrevelant imo . 
  the reason is ammount of graduates in country . 
  that 's the case generally in europe - masters is the minimum in many countries . 
  bachelor is seen as an artificial midpoint that really should n't exist as for cheating it 's considered normal - mainly due to literal bullshit filler you need get pass during studies . 
  how much you can get away with depends on the lecurer 's attitude, 
   in canada , you just get a bachelor of whatever meanwhile in poland bachelor is nothing , could as well have failed highschool, 
   powi\u015ble , wola and mokot\u00f3w those are districts of warsaw for people wondering, 
  look up http://warsawrising.eu/ < -- it 's very well made presentation, 
  warsaw uprising front page post chain http://warsawrising.eu/ < -- portal/presentation about the pre/war/after warsaw with focus on the uprisings ( language in teh bottom right ) the sung song : [ warszawskie dzieci ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxytwuye8wq ) ( = children of warsaw ) [ few other songs for the occasion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vlf3h/warsaw_pays_tribute_to_wwii_insurgency/d5zy247?context=3 ), 
  we are not taking about adding lanes , but having funtional lanes , not 1,5 lane instead of 2, 
  [ few songs for the occasion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vlf3h/warsaw_pays_tribute_to_wwii_insurgency/d5zy247?context=3 ), 
  almost like changing the airport runway surface, 
  watch out what you are wishing for . 
  here we got a trend of remaking roads to have wide bike + pedestrian lanes by the cost of car lanes width . 
  sometimes it looks very stupid whene two cars can barely pass one another , but next to it there 's a huge , unused bike & pedestrian lanes, 
  and song about children that took part in the uprising : [ `` dzi\u015b id\u0119 walczy\u0107 , mamo !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqlppqm2f7m ) ( = mom !, 
  today i go to war ! ), 
  and [ \u201e dziewczyna z granatem '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ptpmq4zrgw ) ( = gal with a grande ) from [ czas honoru ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4194136/ ) series also [ cool song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzkcet3jotc ) from [ miasto 44 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3765326/ ), 
  and this how you fix a big artery , not lane by lane over 4months like it 's done here, 
  pretty nice shots, 
  is the presidency anything more than a label ? 
  you got a warsaw with few districts destroyed ( after '39 warsaw was still pretty ok for a wartime standards ) versus a leveled-to-the-ground city . 
  ( anecdotal ) from stories from my grandmom it varied - in local relations it often depended on jew 's behaviour - there were two types of jews : `` assimilated ones '' ( poles of jewish faith ) and `` ghetto ones '' ( closed jewish comminities ) . 
  [ but we suffered most !, 
   it seems that they have a big buthurt , caused that the world youth day was a success in poland and try to find any - even ridiculous arguments - to present them in a bad light i do n't see any butthurt , could you elaborate ? 
  what about wyd is shown in a bad light ? 
  the article is pretty spot on imo - there 's a dissonance between the pope and polish church, 
  it 's a context, 
   no one truly knows and that 's the point - noone knows , but religious people claim to do, 
   as i understand abortion is forbidden nope , legal in case of : - when the woman 's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy , - when the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act , or - when the fetus is seriously malformed, 
   which country/organization currently has a better economy ? 
  russia - 40 % seems to cover that, 
  and home violence, 
  number of people willing to live in the eu/west ( it 's more reasonable comparison since previous questions were about eu/us ) is much higher though, 
  but we additionally got few more layers of reasons, 
  well duh - more % should pick russia considering 1 and 2, 
  map about the countries mentioned in the usa wiki - i 'm surprised poland is not mentioned considering ko\u015bciuszko & pu\u0142awski 's involvement in the war of independence, 
   you 're also conflating groups that may very well have limited overlap with such numbers ? 
  it 's certain the overlap is significant, 
   which did n't particularly had to do much with russia , but meant more family oriented as opposed to consumerism eu does n't exclude that by any means, 
  ofc . 
  i mean knowing some specifics , how life looks , traveling there etc, 
  it 's just a trivia since foreigners usually are not awere that warsaw 's old town was nearly completley destroyed in ww2 and rebuilt soon after, 
  which model of society is more suitable for serbia : russian or eu ? 
  russian - 49 %  6 . 
  which country/organization currently has a better economy ? 
  russia - 40 % and `` in where would you like to live '' they pick mostly eu/western countries , 
   absolutely stunning old town which actually is n't that old ; ), 
  [ townhall ] ( http://www.radio.bialystok.pl/files/index/image/f/154/z/916c2a91baa9a150a8d3206d67caa4bd ) in my hometown , couse who needs consistency, 
  so same as it is now ? 
   i do n't know why you would think that people do n't know anything about belarus . 
  well for one even in poland that 's is its direct neighbour and close cultural neighbour people know nearly nothing of belarus , general knowladge is probably close to the one about e. bhutan . 
  it 's seen as a blank spot on the map, 
  i got really surprised by belarusian roads ( at least the main ones ),
