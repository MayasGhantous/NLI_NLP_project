  it happens from time to time for sure . 
  last year i belive they even shiped ton of stuff from polish museums and made a quite big polish history exposition . 
  i guess we got quite decent cultural exchange with japanese in general [ cool example with polish fencing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnk3eklvg-a ), 
  yea i know it was danced all over europe . 
  i 'm just surprised it 's still danced outside poland . 
   i assume the more common version of polonaise outside of poland is the more march-like version of it than the version the japanaise are performing here some examples : - [ end of highschool prom ` like thing called `` studni\u00f3wka '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqqld9u_jui ) - [ another one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p-efu9udsg ) - [ with fancy outfits by some folk dancers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxnwk5hkjyy ), 
  all i guess since it 's part of polish culture festival, 
  i thought it 's only a polish thing, 
  come on we are talking to a spaniard here, 
  there 's no clicking heels in polonaise . 
  while the vid seems to be quite accurate though in ballet style . 
  it 's kind of pointless to dance it without pairs in such small group - it 's meant to be danced in bigger groups where you make various tunnels , elaborate partner switches and other figures, 
  on averege probably higher than rest of eu, 
   air full of coal from late september to early may only southern poland though you forgot about pessimistic mentality , lack of sunlight in winter,

  similar case with chicago, 
  she got french citizenship , not nationality, 
   because we consider nationality as above everything else and in accordance with that rule you consider marie curie as french ?
