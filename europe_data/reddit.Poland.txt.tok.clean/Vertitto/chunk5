   i do n't recall ever seeing an `` evil poland '' comic [ here ] ( http://i1.kwejk.pl/k/obrazki/2014/11/bfea8734-f602-48e8-beb4-bc771446ca7b.png ) ; ), 
  about european culture that i think is worth sharing : i ' v recently read a fragment on that in one of leszek ko\u0142akowski ( polish modern philosopher/essayist ) esseys about culture : ~ `` that , which defines european culture is the ability to constantly question itself '', 
  shhh, 
  weird that it works on the yt app , but not on yt internet site, 
   i 've seen that are significantly different are \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 ( moscow ) and \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c ( crimea ) , then again i have n't looked at too many . 
  significantly different ? 
  they are nearly the same lol . 
  ( moskva and krym ), 
  they could start accept eve 's plex as well , i guess they would have better luck with it, 
   describing routes to russians when you do n't speak russian well is very hard though . 
  in bulgarian the word for `` straight ahead '' means `` on the right '' in russian and you constantly make that mistake . 
  smartphones are our saviours, 
  noone has it easy there , that 's the point of it . 
  and nearly once a week there 's something good about poland and baltics here . 
  romanian sport sabre fencers are always a treat to watch, 
  yea as if agro limits were n't hurting us enough, 
  most of the people claiming to speak russian here : `` yea , i had russian in school ( over 40y ago ) and i once talked with russian vendor ( 80 % of whitch was sign language ) i totaly speak russian '', 
  we even export milk to china . 
  i ' v read it 's even cheaper than the local one ... 
  german spelling ? 
  why does n't yt suppot subs on mobile, 
  dunno for others , poland uses english and german . 
  it 's pretty hard to find russian speakers , unless it 's company that focuses exclusivly on russia . 
  imo it 's on the same level as eg . 
  french or sspanish, 
  english and german and all is ok you may have problems in france couse they do n't want to speak in either of those for general usefullness it 's also good to know russian eg . 
  for baltics , belarus , ukraine and balcans all depends with who you want to make business with, 
  look up his post history ( damn you can not see the user now ; he posts ton of stuff like that on / r/irleand ), 
  they do , but some pick europe couse it 's `` rich and cool and all '', 
  why would you want to protect yourself from wind during summer ? 
  it 's a new thing ? 
  from what i know it 's normal to take pictures ( eg . 
  wedding ones ) at such statues ( like lenin , ww2 which are in all towns ), 
  i thought the fences were a german thing that got popular here, 
  but then you just end up with belarusian ; ), 
  ofc , just saying in general sense in case so people do n't confuse his role with eg . 
  that of us president, 
  note : president in poland has little power ; it 's the pm who has power here ( general elections are soon - in autumn ), 
  and menu needs to be in polish and use roman numerals, 
  i see we got educational let 's - hug-polan week, 
  french ? 
  i does n't have to be lies . 
  it can be telling just one part of the story that conviniently supports his points while completly not mentioning the bad stuff, 
  i call fake : no hands , legs , eye pupils and eye brows, 
  i find most of his videos quite enjoyable , but this one looks like pseudo patriotic mombojumbo, 
  but it pops up in google search so they placed there #quality, 
  norway has a boat ? 
  that 's weird . 
  reminds me of that cartoon with creepy trains, 
  general elections are in few months ( something around november iirc ) and so far i 'm for nowoczesnapl - `` new '' party in poland , a centrist , liberal organisation formed by ryszard petru , the president of the society of polish economists , an economic think tank . 
  the party has a strongly reformist , free market agenda , their proposals include privatisation of state owned coal mines , promotion of science and technology , education reform , abolishing of privileges for farmers etc. 
  at the moment it 's unclear whether or not they will be able to cross the 5 % electoral threshold . 
  ( discription taken from u/jakub70 from [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f1u3r/say_i_am_a_new_voter_in_your_country_and_i_have/ctkpcj8 ) tl ; dr a party that seems to focus on actual governing the country instead of making politics for politics sake, 
  polish people will never understand that, 
  year ? 
  source ? 
  anything ? 
   from these lublin wins easily . 
  it 's the perfect combination of advantages of big and small city . 
  imo 3city wins in this aspect + you got sea and ton of forests, 
   ljubljana : the bern of the east . 
  the two are nearly a stone throw lenght from each other , lol, 
  and you say polish has no vovels ... 
  it 's illusion as we just got duble letters eg . 
  most words follow the c-v-c-v or c-c-v model , tong twisters like that are exception, 
  replace london as world financial center ( would need some strong will but is possible ), 
  why would one want uk to leave ? 
   laser gun you mean that imperial flash light ? 
  i 'm no expirience travler by any means , but this sounds a bit absurd for me . 
  try searching for it at / r/travel, 
  is there even any ( normal ) country that check people 's hard drives at entry ? 
  sounds absurd, 
  or 3city ( gda\u0144sk / gdynia/sopot ) for chilling and festivals, 
  few pictures from different angles https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fixbq/whats_the_worst_city_in_europe_youve_been_to_or/ctpnwm3, 
  many people do n't believe it would work , others see it as surrending their own independence or create an obsolete expendature for their country, 
  skandinavian `` jag '' is missleading as it 's pronounced `` yo '', 
  comparing to other small towns like that it 's pretty neat . 
  depends when was the last time you ' v been there . 
  atm it 's pretty nice , especially with good weather also how unlucky you need to be to find your small home town in such thread also : few shoots of the same street in different angles : [ 1 ] ( http://polskiemiasta.tv/miasta_foto/1460.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.mapofpoland.pl/zdjecia-17870/ul-dluga-lomza.jpg ) ; area around the river : [ 1 ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/mzy7mdqsmcw5ldjhocwxn2u7mdysmziwldfjmg__/f022ce8f7db0db752b153172095c5c72.jpg ) ,, 
  oh the irony - `` video not avaiable in your country '', 
  visit warsawrising portal ( could someone post link to it , i 'm on phone ) . 
  it 's great, 
  you do ? 
  look up [ frank shuman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_shuman ), 
   before ww2 we had 35 % of population as minorities ( jews , ukrainians , germans etc. ), 
  nearly all of the minorities were white though ; ), 
  if n.africa menages to stabilise then it would be awesome . 
  reviving the pre-ww1 sahara solar panels project could become possible, 
  yey lets buy support vassels where the navy has almost no fighting ships ( [ polish navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_navy#ships_and_naval_aircraft ) ) ; ), 
   by that logic poland , serbia and russia are hipsters west in general thinks that it 's global leader behind various movements when in reality they were the lagging ones in many cases among the civilised world ( hygiene , women rights , gay rights , religion rights etc ) and just made a big leap from shithole to progressive, 
   i do n't understand why anyone would n't write cursive . 
  my writting was unreadable ( tiny short letters like `` a `` or `` c '' with long bodies letters like `` d '' , `` l `` etc made it look like arabic ) so my teachers told me to write using `` print '' letters . 
  now i only use cursive for my personal signature, 
  that 's what i ' v been also thinking , but word `` passion '' does n't fit it for me that much - i 'm wondering if there 's another reason and what it may be, 
  ~ ~ do people actually learn cursive writting in schools ? 
  it 's not a thing in poland ~ ~ or i 'm understanding what cursive writting is wrongly - by cursive you mean fency , ornamental writting ( calligraphy ) or just joint letters ? 
  / edit : i thought cursive was calligraphical writting, 
   but this is generally considered incorrect hmm i ' v been taught that it 's fully correct , but name-surname is prefered, 
  poland viewed by turkey as `` passion land '' ? 
  could someone explain ?
