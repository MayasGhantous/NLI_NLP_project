  seems not good enough . 
  we recked them so much we ended their golden age, 
   when we enter someone 's house we say `` may be praised jesus christ '' and others answer `` for centuries of centuries ( forever ) amen '' . 
  eeee that 's a streach [ i was n't eve ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl5rmmpihp8 ) ( song ), 
  if someone like folk and would like something more modern i recommend brathanki ( mix of folk , rock and pop , some riffs are even metal ) , some of their best songs : - [ playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwrhdn2xusa&amp;list=pl35o0ibmaer30ml6h2hrpn5dp5e2kxpss ) - [ gdzie ten , kt\u00f3ry powie mi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clmjwj-y5io ) - [ modli\u0142a si\u0119 dziewczyna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxextlwx0pe ) - [ czerwone korale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1zhyvtszlq ) - [ w kinie , w lublinie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwrhdn2xusa ) - [ siebie dam po \u015blubie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjik7ii8hwi ) - [ za wielkim morzem ty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myppbxyjknw ) - [ heniek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hip1jilnrxy ) - [ hej g\u00f3ry , hej g\u00f3ry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r5hzocemzg ) ( this sounds like some heavy metal ballad ) thanks czechs for halina mlynkov\u00e1 < 3 / edit : since you are ex-yugo here 's [ yugoton ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx8sddtcypk ) project in which polish artists make polish remakes of yugo hits ( [ malcziki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inxdj-i-yi8 ) ftw ! ), 
  germany was popular ~ 15 years ago , ireland/uk got more popular when kids who had had english as 1st foreign entered working age, 
  stil pick, 
  we pick ireland/uk as primary destination, 
  they work in germany, 
   scandees ? 
  good : belarus , kazahstan , mongolia ( ? 
  ) , china , best korea bad : poland , ukraine , baltics , finland , georgia , japan , azerbaijan pretty bad in general i guess, 
  the a pope become the pope, 
  [ polan defended yurop from evil kebap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ), 
   our minister of education does n't believe in that bullshit called the evolution . 
  that 's very not-catholic of him . 
  you disquallified yourself  bitch , please . 
  we saved vienna from kebab . 
  so we are basically why europe is not kabab today sorry that was us, 
  nothing you are just smaller , better to back the bigger ; )  \u010d , \u0161 , and \u017e letters sz , cz , \u017c / rz master race, 
  that 's just being jealous for not being no1 [ barka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuv0pgabw_8 ) ( `` bardzo \u0142adna nowa wersja ! '', 
  lol ) is the pope song, 
  who cares , it 's just ~ 15 % ( and pretty much whole of that is greek catholic , which does n't count ), 
  they had some border dispute with croats https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93slovenia_border_disputes, 
  few % is not enough, 
  who had a pope ? 
  i guess it 's settled anyway slovenian imperialists are the worst, 
  i do n't get it, 
  at least it 's better than the reposts that popped up, 
   high fertility rate and low abortion rate ( pretty much go hand in hand ) they do n't seem to https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4scq2k/fertility_rate_in_europe/, 
  until the proposal has some sense and is propietly filed it 's pointless as it is now it 's a goal to work thowards , not an obligation, 
  which still has no effect on anything . 
  it 's just an obligation with no repercussions and deadline infinitly pushed into the future . 
  one of eu 's bullshit rules, 
  each blob is a family mayby, 
  some brit got drunk and drown in some river, 
  also while at it - go and watch the trilogy of sami swoi - if you can understand them you will be fine in poland 1 . 
  [ sami swoi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcpym42vmo0 ) 2 . 
  [ sami swoi : nie ma mocnych ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtew6hw1g_k ) 3 . 
  [ sami swoi : kochaj albo rzu\u0107 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxdxvoyfe_o ), 
  never heard that, 
  also euro2012 in poland & ukriane also got lots of shit before the tournament, 
  for polish - learn the alphabet - unlike in english it 's usefull as it will make reading much easier - since you are short on time concentrate on simple sentence structures ( eg . 
  i want , i can or questions ) and simple vocab ; don ; ' t dive into grammar you will end up like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/kxdxvoyfe_o?t=1h14m59s ) anyway ; ), 
   they just do n't have the mechanisms to force you to meet the compact 's terms and this can be the case for forever , calling it an obligation is a joke, 
   would they be required to commit to the euro ? 
  noone is, 
  milk in tea is a heresy, 
  the speaking part is also super exaggerated - they just had it at school, 
  oh we are better then them - our rulling guy is not even in any office and therefore not accountable for what he does , 
  mayby it 's just a thing in podlasie, 
  we are the new hungarians, 
  along with greece , turkey , romania and albania . 
  meanwhile poland , lithuania and belarus are all in on latin ( well belarusians are not all in ), 
  `` czaj '' also works in polish , though it 's quite rare and usually refers to very strong tea, 
  at least they will compete in other disciplines - go go no1 sabre : alexey yakimenko !, 
  ( highlights : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsmxx8rhk0 ) and [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv1ftwyzknw ) ) i wonder when they will end the asthma epidemy in skiing, 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/09/obama-slammed-polish-democracy-on-friday-heres-how-polish-tv-proved-him-right/?tid=sm_tw ( vid )  `` more work needs to be done , '' obama said . 
  `` and as your friend and ally , we 've urged all parties to work together to sustain poland 's democratic institutions . ''  but viewers of telewizja polska , the main public broadcaster , saw a very different suggestion on the evening news . 
   `` ninety-five percent of the meeting was about issues of nato and security , but obama praised polish efforts at democracy , '' the reporter said . 
  `` concerning the issue of the constitutional tribunal , he said he is sure that spreading democratic values in poland will not stop . '', 
  that 's targeted at islam , not gay though, 
  it 's not exactly the same thing , but both articels are about the same phenomenon, 
  polish church has invented a new word clound with words like homoempire , gender ideology etc that do n't mean anything precise and work as an umbrella for various things they do n't like, 
  not the homoimperium part ? 
  the normal part is hugely exaggerated - it 's a break between normal subejcts where by default you get max grade, 
  that depends if you are a men . 
  no , they are pretty serious , which makes it both hilarious and scarry, 
  titles and stories, 
  those are the worst, 
  it 's one of thenews outlets that are heavy competition to satire fake news portals, 
  indeed , good point . 
  the `` want to make abortion completely illegal '' is just one of the unattainable ideas , not something that is under work, 
  in a bit eli5 way : it offers services very similar to bank ones , your fund are also protected by bank guarantee fund , but the institutions do n't have to be subject to the same level of scrutiny , oversite as banks do ( and they vocally want to keep it that way ) . 
  there has been affairs connected to them . 
  on my uni they are considered to be quite shady institutions, 
  credit unions are just retarded versions of banks in poland, 
  what has it to do with safty ? 
  wow the ranking changed completely - it was japan 1st and poland 2nd previously, 
  snarky comment would be most i would expect, 
  i specially picked the least spoilery vid - you do n't see what he is reacting to and when, 
  it 's aleardy been clarified  but they are n't news networks . 
  but why ? 
  i mean it 's the individual 's decision to learn/decide about his nationality, 
  hmm pretty much exactly the same ( or even less due to size ) as poland is now , 
  people who can , but have not described/registered themselves as jews, 
  that 's really cool, 
  kgb was a firce rival in knock-knock jokes though, 
   according to the moses schorr centre , there are 100,000 jews living in poland who do n't actively practice judaism and do not list `` jewish '' as their nationality . 
  [ 250 ] the jewish renewal in poland organization estimates that there are 200,000 `` potential jews '' in poland . 
  [ 251 ] the american jewish joint distribution committee and jewish agency for israel estimate that there are between 25,000 and 100,000 jews living in poland , [ 252 ] a similar number to that estimated by jonathan ornstein , head of the jewish community center in krakow ( between 20,000 and 100,000 ) . 
  [ 253 ] [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_poland#numbers_of_jews_in_poland_since_1920 )  between 20,000 and 100,000 hahah , nice estimation  ( i understand where it comes from , but nevertheless it 's a hilarious spread ), 
  [ just in case younger redditors did n't get the reference to the cool movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spbjpogrtya ), 
  who are inturn [ controlled by jews ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gj9w0xx.png ) !, 
  tc was n't an institution you heard lot about , most people got no idea how it worked ( or probably even existed ) . 
  the whole case would probably fly by had it not been for how pis dealt with it giving ammo to opposition, 
  what do you exactly mean ? 
  they are both in hands of evil zionists from israel !, 
  border control : `` wow a guy from san marino !, 
  noone will believe me !,
