  can i have a picture with you ? '', 
  for serious : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_marino_passport and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area#status_of_the_european_microstates, 
  we are talking about the most basic , `` free '' setup, 
  indeed from purely news channels it 's tvp info and regionalna ( also tvp ) . 
  [ site ] ( http://www.naziemna.eu/index.php/kanaly ) but they still got the daily news on tvn and polsat, 
  is n't polsat news also on the basic setup ? 
  they got also access to polsat and tvn to balance things out, 
  meanwhile germany is one of the top weapon exporters, 
  post translation please, 
  us will be responsible for one in poland germans for one in lithuania canadians in latvia and british in estonia the battalions are supposed to be multinational [ source ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/nato-wysle-cztery-bataliony-do-polski-i-krajow-baltyckich-3557197.html ) ( in polish ), 
   did you miss the bit where his schools expelled him because of his down syndrome ? 
  or is overcoming that sort of treatment only uplifting if he 's severely intellectually disabled as well ? 
  that 's overcoming standard prejustice , hardly a thing to be noteworthy on international forum . 
   not everyone with an intellectual disability is a drooling vegetable . 
  i never claimed that, 
  got whole 5 , hurrey ... ( 4 considering that one was polish ), 
  if the teen from article has no intellectual disability then the uplifting part is pretty invalid, 
   [ uplifting ] or at the same time it may be sad that a person with disorder containing intellectual disability can score 7/10 in romanian school system, 
  yea cosue fuck peace, 
  it 's from 2011, 
  they should have their embassy in liberland and sealand and form an union, 
  with catholics there 's a pope and with recent luck they do n't denay science, 
  meanwhile here it 's saint marry , queen of poland, 
   except poland , no idea why tho answer is heavily political church ( from the partition times church was very political and worked as resistance cell against the occupants ) + having polish pope, 
  meanwhile our bible belt is south eastern part of the country, 
  can not think of any , most songs are from napoleonic and newer times this is clsoe enough i guess : [ krzesimir d\u0119bski - polonez husarii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzklijgxuti ) ( polonaise of hussary ; from [ ogniem i mieczem ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128378/ ) movie ), 
  polish military and patriotic songs [ playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjpg0m1v4i0&amp;index=17&amp;list=plpbgtsnfz5mngtiuy_bct0msgmxfa4pns ), 
  i dunno where the trand came from . 
  most of the new block are built in this way . 
  it 's really annoying and often problematic eg . 
  it 's hard for ambulance to enter fast if need or simply have visiting firend 's car parked somewhere, 
   the old town is also quite small compared to other cities in poland , like wroclaw or krakow or gdansk . 
  couse the one in warsaw was destroyed in ww2 ( city got leveled to the point people were thinking whether it 's worth to rebuilt it at all ; you can find pictures on google ) and partly reconstructed from nearly only pictures and remaining fundaments so it 's not really so old [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_old_town ) ; [ postcard ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/da/d4/14/dad41495bef57c1059ce8e502a06c271.jpg ) ( it 's cool , but bit missleading though ) also pretty interesting photo : [ newly built palace of culture ] ( http://culture.pl/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/field/events/clipboard01_2.jpg?itok=bm3hfwzf ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.mojeurlopy.pl/upload/object/1350/images/463116b3883a862707b1e29733da61e1.jpg ) ;, 
  it would n't be a joke if polan was n't in space . 
  it 's a meme so beaten to the ground i imagine everyone knows that by now, 
  standards : m : jan kowalski f : anna kowalska [ most numerous surnames ] ( https://mswia.gov.pl/pl/aktualnosci/12891,100-najpopularniejszych-polskich-nazwisk.html ) and [ names ] ( https://mswia.gov.pl/download/1/21753/imnajpopinajrzad2005-2014.pdf ) ( names are from newborns per year over last 10 years ), 
  it does n't show 1000 years ... also you could have posted link to the original , not the screen capture from yt, 
  thread about space missions ? 
  polan can not into space will always be one of the first comments, 
  exactly, 
  dead ? 
  no , immortality is polan 's superpower - it dies and lives again , such is life, 
  ha ha !, 
  poland is already in esa !, 
  the trick is that it was polan who sent them all into space , polan is hero, 
  it was a thing throughout the whole europe in middle ages, 
  i hate the weird size ration euro are in, 
   copernicus center of science is n't that aimed at children ? 
  i guess nsfw applies here since title sucks : it 's one of those campaigns showing how animals in slaughterhouses are treated . 
  this one focuses on the killing part, 
  a bit wrong sub, 
  [ party like eu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbbynqzgj8o ) gets real, 
  / r/poland guides on the right + [ search ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/search?q=warsaw&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on ) + [ yt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=travel+warsaw ), 
  you are missing the point . 
  noone has to leave citizens outside the country did n't have to live in the country to begin with . 
  exaggerated to absurd hypothetical situation : brazilians get portugal citizenship by the sole virtue of being a brazilian citizen and you end up with unchanged population in portugal , but now 190 mln people are living outside it . 
  in more realistical setting - part of country emigrates over the years and have more children than the home population - such situation can lead to high outside population while the home one stays relatively the same, 
   portugal would be deserted . 
  why would that be ? 
  you can have even 40000 % of people living outside the country and country can still be packed, 
  well you can , especially when the result was nearly 50:50 and the leave block instantly backed out of their promises and the fast realitycheck happened . 
  the referendum could just lead to a bigger and longer discussion on the eu scale . 
  i would say there 's bigger problems with eu officials, 
   or eastern european countries are willing to do accept that why would that be ? 
  so not allowing a muslim country still valid : ^ ), 
  is there a country where it 's actually true ? 
  aside from few cases in us and sweden where people make fun of and internet circlejerks, 
  couse who would like to end up as a amoeba in the next life, 
  would be german or mix of international words i guess, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/jokes/comments/4pxwn7/there_were_three_pows_together_in_a_british/ ), 
  tackling the important stuff, 
  `` obilgation '' what kind of obligation it is when it has no deadline nor repercussions ? 
  or rather nazichick, 
  [ animated history of belarus in 5 minutes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxlagbg9qkm ), 
  you confuse nationality with citizenship, 
  not exactly , especially when the that region is autonomous and pretty heated, 
  reminder : russia is multinational country where all the nationalities hold russian passport . 
  this suspect is a dagestani ( caucasus ), 
  and please tell why the nato enlargement happened in the first place, 
  your analogy does n't exactly match with the reality though . 
  it 's more the guy from the house is weaving his gun around sending threats to everyone and giving fire bursts in the air and he 's surprised that all the neighbours are barricading away from him, 
  cool action ; ), 
  why would it be ? 
  what 's the logic behind criminalising it ? 
   the shitstorm will be unbelievable with nearly 50:50 referendum result and the backlash they got ? 
  go away , do n't steal the spotlight i was first, 
  would be cool if it was n't posted here already, 
  or place where carpathians mountains are [ carpathian region ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/carpathians_region.svg/640px-carpathians_region.svg.png ) from wiki ( sub regions : i - subcarpathia , ii - southromanian plains , iii - pannonian basin , iv - carpathian mountains ), 
  and poland , and czech  and a minimal part of ukraine they got more carpathian mountains than hungary ... [ map ] ( http://www.karpaty.pl/nasz_reg/images/mapa.jpg ), 
  they are busy milking game of thrones money, 
  how many times it will be posted here ? 
  i always thought that lithuania is mocked least from the 3 baltics, 
  under the stairs playing with imaginary dragons, 
  there 's difference between checking out options and making fearmongering assumption out of the thin air, 
   they are not that bad in making decisions it 's basically a coin flip - you got people voting about a thing they know nothing about, 
  beef : keep in mind that : 1 . 
  gb has n't left the eu , it had only a referendum , which is just a glorified opinion poll . 
  there 's shit load of time before gb actually leaves ( if it leaves at all ) , and this leads to 2nd point 2 . 
  noone knows how it will look like , there will be few years of negotiations and consulting before anything gets changed so it would be cool if people stopped making up stuff like `` i will lose by eu passport '' or `` they will deport me '' and acting as if britain stopped existing . 
  warsaw has few new skyscreapers going , so it would be nice ... you know if mayby ... ... mayby ... consider polan ; ),
