  or as a free city state ? 
  hmm ; ), 
  magyars not joining polan ? 
  do n't worry it 's sport fencing , thye will kill themselves while going at you ; ),

  what has it to do with brexit ? 
  i fail to see a conection, 
  oh boy i wonder if he had heard of youtube yet, 
   ca n't think of a better real-world target than isis at the moment . 
  besides maybe north korea . 
  there 's also plenty of genocidal warchiefs in africa . 
  if you look around there 's many places where you could play with new toys, 
  having no people at all also works, 
  i wonder what about unified anti-islamist muslim community like we got in poland, 
  getting political nato points, 
  not official : [ holiday in poland | 4k ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekz6i58kvpi ) or [ poland is beautiful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbu_frg8vuu ), 
  the narrator is polish guru of documentary narration - krystyna czub\u00f3wna , polish equivalent of david attenborough, 
  3city ( gda\u0144sk , gdynia & sopot ) is pretty good - big aglomeration ( ~ 750.000 people ) , but it is n't fast-paced like most cities of this size - pretty cheap - very green - it 's located in the tricity landscape park , [ pic ] ( http://galeria.trojmiasto.pl/org/1271556_.jpg ) , lot of places to go biking - located at the seaside , baltic is pretty cold , but always water ; ) - sopot is party capital of poland - university city - well communicated - airports , roads/railway to rest of country , has a ferry to sweden, 
  gb * fixed, 
  i guess poland and gb could be overtaking turkey in that department, 
  it 's an extension of involvment in asian infrastructure investment bank and it 's key project - the new `` silk road '' , in which poland is one of the transshipment hubs, 
  pretty accurate for polish and belarusian, 
  you do n't want to know, 
  and bonus points if they do n't like each other, 
  actually [ we do n't have friends ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6pwmc7o.png ), 
  we got behind the scenes contest with turkey for most bizzare politics, 
  it 's very informative , but in a school lesson ( with some pictures ) way . 
  it 's pretty ok for people that had n't had russia mentioned in school, 
  some context mayby ? 
  kind of - in gdynia we got [ cudawianki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxjb1lara ) festival it referes to mid summer holiday called [ kupala night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kupala_night ) with the wreaths ( = wianki in polish ) - both in the name and they are done for girls there . 
  in general it 's detached from the pagan celebration and works like summer season start/day of the city with lot of family picnic-type attractions and concerts on the beach . 
  main bands this year will be : blue deep shorts , taco hemingway , \u00d8rganek & nneka so if someone is planing to go to gda\u0144sk ( gda\u0144sk , sopot and gdynia are part of one big aglomeration called 3city ) , make sure to visit gdynia on 24.06 / edit ; bonus : song about kupala night : [ \u017bywio\u0142ak - noc kupa\u0142y ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1neyaez6ue ) ( pretty addictive song , it 's the witcher iii-like song ) ; they infact made a song for witcher2 : [ \u041e\u0439 \u0422\u0438 , \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0435 , \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0435 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hduygnvx92k ) ; my fav song of theirs - [ \u015awidryga i midryga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihmp6eo05jk ), 
  cross post it to / r/mapporn, 
  how big were the data sets ? 
  so waiting for i 'm pope ama ? 
  is n't one dude yelling enough for slovenia ? 
  polish production is not what 's the project for . 
  the terminal is way to harbour other gas suppilers eg . 
  us , canada , norway , arab countries etc. 
  now wait till you see someone from san marino, 
  so azers ? 
   poland will be our closest ally for another 50 years at least as long as kids will still be learning the [ friendship is magic rhyme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ), 
  nations got friends , states do n't, 
  eesti loves finalnd you got latvia i guess,

  case of `` turkey supports isis by buying oil from them '' is solved - they just call them iraq ; ^ ), 
  gas mostly from russia , oil from iraq ( dunno how it 's now ) gas :  in 2015 , turkey imported around 51 bcm of gas . 
  58 % of the natural gas is imported from russia , followed by iran with 18 % , azerbaijan ( 12 % ) , algeria ( 7,7 % ) and nigeria ( 2,4 % ) . 
  oil :  turkey imports around 89 % of its oil supplies . 
  in 2015 , turkey imported 25 million tons of crude oil in 2015 mainly from iraq ( 45,6 % ) , iran ( 22,4 % ) , russia ( 12,4 % ) saudi arabia ( 9,6 % ) , colombia ( 3,5 % ) , kazakhstan ( 2,6 % ) and nigeria ( 2,1 % ) . 
  it has nothing to do with what you said though . 
  you treat poland as a continous object , but you do n't apply the same rule for other countries . 
  there 's no kingdom of poland any more either tsarist russia & prussia ? 
  there 's no polish -- lithuanian commonwealth any more either iii reich ? 
  there 's no 2nd commonwealth * of poland any more either ussr ? 
  there 's no polish people 's republic any more either / edit : * for foreigners : commonwealth = republic , in polish we use rzeczpospolita ( = commonwealth ) not republic when talking about the polish state , it 's not reserved only for plc. 
  today full name of state in polish is iii rzeczpospolita polska , which directly translates to 3rd commonwealth of poland, 
   where is tsarist russia , ussr , ii and iii reich , the mongols , prussia ? 
  still there . . that 's really failed example . 
  you apply different continuality rule for poland and other countries, 
  it 's not polish gas that will be sold . 
  we will just be reselling gas from other suppliers like arab countries, 
  but not space as only sky is the limit, 
  costs + margin, 
  so they got official genealogy trees ? 
  they do ( to some extent ) , profiling is standard statistical tool . 
  there 's nothing racist about it . 
  it 's starts to be racist if based on the profiling you discriminate a group . 
   because you are discriminating against an entire race what the hell are you talking about ? 
  [ goal ] ( https://streamable.com/ifmn ), 
  we won , but quality of play was subpar to say the least, 
  look up the ending ; ), 
  one of the songs sung by polish side is chorus of kids song [ `` og\u00f3rek '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh5uboscm6s ) ( = cucumber ; lyrics go like : `` cucumber , cucumber , cucumber , he has green suit , and hat and boots , he 's all green , all green all green '' ) : ), 
  not really , i do n't think so . 
  it has polish subs though, 
  and the freaking super catchy chorus . 
  i had that thing for over a week in my head, 
  hurrey for [ \u042d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et281uhnoou ), 
  german webbrowsers should have a vpn feature as a default . 
  that shit must be annoying as fuck, 
  that intro sentence lol / edit : and this  this video is my message to the members of the european commission and the parliament , especially to mr. frans timmermans , mr. schulz , mr.junker , mr. verhofstadt , frau merkel and others , who ignited the fire of hatred against legally elected polish authorities , thus , against the free will of the polish people , thus , against the polish people as a whole . 
  national matches is not exactly their thing though, 
  the blade is standard sport fencing fie epee blade ( it 's used for fencing , not a wallhanger ) , the hilt is custom ( brass cup & pommel + wooden handle ) it 's made by [ marcin w\u0119gli\u0144ski ] ( http://www.bronbiala.pl/galeria/ ) iirc ( club orders from few guys , i never remember who exactly makes what ), 
  blacksmiths still do verious ornamental things with metal objects eg . 
  gates, 
  what 's the deal with that ? 
   the sort of speculation you see all the time in financial times , the economist , frankfurter allgemeine , etc yes , they can suck hard . 
  that does n't mean we can go down to such standards  one can not look at graphs and take scientifically proven conclusions almost never in economics . 
  that 's just the very nature of so-called social sciences . 
  you however got tools of statistics/econometrics to tear out the weeds . 
  i understand that it 's / r/europe not / r/dataisbeautiful , but keep it classy, 
  what you do here however , is bullshitting hiding behind `` speculation '' term . 
  it 's armchair laic 's speculation , not something that you would expect form a scientist working in finance, 
  you can only say that fin gdp growth sucks . 
  you can not say anything about ez from that switch finalnd with eg . 
  ireland , germany or frence and see how dumb your `` model '' looks, 
  not really , it shows only fin vs swe gdp . 
  you can not get anything about euro vs home currency from this,
