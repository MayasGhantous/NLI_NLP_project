  i did n't said it was better or that i would iike those - just that from today 's perspective those numbers are absolutely ridiculous, 
  and imagine 20 years ago you could get nearly 20 % and ~ 10 % 6 years ago on a deposit, 
  and alior bank offers a deposit interest rate of which depends on number of goals scored by polish team ( base 2 % +0,1 pp per goal scored ) https://www.aliorbank.pl/klienci-indywidualni/oszczednosci/lokata-kibica.html, 
  there are a lot more polish ones , but that does n't mean there 's few euro ones, 
  there 's ton of them , at least in poland, 
  sorry , but i 'm to tired to check as i have n't slept at all . 
  iirc they do it twice a year or quartally . 
  look up when previous ones were released, 
  dunno how long you are following polandball , but from the jew-related ones [ wizardry is not kosher ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x6zv0rz.png ) ( really dark one ) and [ powerpuff axis ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qypig2g.png ) are one of my favs ( there are few other high on my list like ukraine being atlantis or some of the being behind everything inceptions , but i 'm to lazy to search forthem atm ), 
  we are paying back all the time . 
  it 's not just closed funds circulation ( brain drain mentioned in the [ population decline thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4n44v5/eastern_europe_has_the_largest_population_loss_in/ ) is one of such additional aspects ), 
  [ eurobarometer ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_publ_en.pdf ) for comparison ( page 113 is most similar i guess ), 
  [ israel exposed ] ( https://pics.onsizzle.com/facebook-~kovesh-63d4d5.png ) is my fav jew meme existing, 
  [ indeed , litarally everything ] ( https://thisaintnews.com/static/user/pics/1400716800/1401225307_jews-are-behind-everything.png ), 
  meanwhile poland dropped from 17 to 22 ; (, 
  but this map does n't follow this rule . 
  ( at least for poland/lithuania , i assume nor does it for others ), 
  it 's not about calling countries like that generally , but randomly without any context or rule ( it seems ) behind it, 
  it 's pointless to make it completley random in the vid though, 
  it 's really weird when randomly country is called after rulling dynasty, 
  nor was it for czechoslovakia before . 
  it 's just a weird nuance of politics & nationality spread, 
  well we could foster commie block architecture : ^ ), 
  the `` poland so bad , they took part in partitions of czechoslovakia '' argument looks legit until you look at the history of the polish-czechoslovak disputed area eli5 tl ; dr : it 's about a small region , you can barely notice on the map , that had been juggled between poland and czech since pretty much medival times . 
  it heated up after ww1 when borders were drawn [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie ), 
  hobbit policy is kind of impossible with poland 's location, 
  not everyone imports trash to burn though, 
  they burn the trash , savages, 
  wow so polish sounds for russians just like for all other non slavs ? 
  mindblown ; d  ( i believe it 's actually written as prze in polish ) psze is also possible, 
   `` say ` pshe ' '' what 's the story behind it ? 
  the default version written in constitution does n't include the god part , it 's optional  ## article 104 ##  1 . deputies shall be representatives of the nation . 
  they shall not be bound by any instructions of the electorate . 
   2 . deputies , before the commencement of the performance of the mandate , shall take the following oath in the presence of the sejm :   `` i do solemnly swear to perform my duties to the nation diligently and conscientiously , to safeguard the sovereignty and interests of the state , to do all within my power for the prosperity of the homeland and the well-being of its citizens , and to observe the constitution and other laws of the republic of poland . '', 
   the oath may also be taken with the additional sentence `` so help me , god . '', 
   3 . a refusal to take the oath shall be deemed to be a renunciation of the mandate . 
  google autocompletes are not steorotypes also was it written in russian or english ? 
  that one kind of died out though, 
  was used in poland = / = was from poland, 
  well we also are part of another group - [ weimar triangle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weimar_triangle ), 
  what ? 
  where did you find that ? 
  so there is something in-beween, 
  belarus ? 
  music : [ yugoton project ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx8sddtcypk ) ( polish rock bands cover yugoslav rocks songs ), 
   but there is n't much shared history with poland , is there ? 
  ton of wars during medival times , common kings , parts of poland were part of austria as well , interwar border wars , struggling together during communism . 
   why is poland part of the v4 and not say slovenia or croatia v4 is not ex-austrohungary meeting , but a throwback to [ meeting in visegr\u00e1d in medival times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group#historical_inspiration ) while together trying to join nato and eu, 
  noone is against the outcome of the elections , but against things the new gov does, 
  but let 's be honest not many people know how chad 's flag looks like, 
   as far as i remember poles were not well off during that period either . 
  it was a splendid time - we nearly colonised syberia : ^ ), 
  `` if kaczy\u0144ski wants to be a dictator , he will have maidan '' , you cut half of the statement and made a new one with different meaning 2 . simple encouraging to protest 3 . 
  similar to 1st one your short summary is very missleading as it does n't show the thought process behind it : `` pis has been breaking boundary after boundary and early elections is the way to break that notion . 
  if we let the notion to continue we will end up having pis 's authoritarian dictature and polish maidan '', 
  i would hardly call that `` calling to do maidan '' / edit : for non polish people - his hyperlink summaries are not accurate, 
   opposition leaders and journalists openly supporting the previous government are calling to do maidan in poland source, 
  depends what pair of countries you pick . 
  cyrylic alphabet alone is a big burden making countires feel very foreign, 
   montenegro flag what 's that ? 
  we will use coa instead ; ), 
  not really, 
  i would love to try the honey-butter ones, 
  we got 67 % of colours though what about belarus , bulgaria , bosnia , fyrom and montenegro ? 
   panslavism russian pretext to invade others  how do you feel about slavs rather ambivalent , sometimes makes it easier to understand ( however having spent time with students from ukraine , it 's easier to use english anyway ) / edit : from panslavic easter eggs heres my favourite song from yugoton project ( polish covers/reinterpretations of yugoslav rock songs ) : [ malcziki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inxdj-i-yi8 ) ( [ original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfi3egxkzh8 ) ) ; [ full album ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx8sddtcypk ), 
  eu-sceptic that wants to leave the union or that does n't want further integration ? 
  that 's a big difference, 
  only 5.2 % ? 
  oo that 's sounds stupidly low, 
  you may be living in a bubble then stats  personal expirience, 
  why would anyone eat it outside christmas time anyway ? 
  why ? 
  judging from eurobarometer it 's a weird pick, 
  yea it 's not christmas carp, 
  [ stoned as fuck ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbbynqzgj8o ), 
   you have much more in common with belarus and russia than with switzerland or germany you do n't know much about the region then . 
  couse it 's factually wrong . 
  it 's dumb to call a yellow thing blue for one instance , just becouse it was once called so for a while,

  no vodka nor carpet on the wall 3/10, 
  that thread got deleted .

  yea just like those damn iranians , 
  never heard of it . 
  if it was winiacz , it was alone or as a popita after vodka, 
  not it poland .
