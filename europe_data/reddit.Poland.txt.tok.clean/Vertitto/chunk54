  random mundane things are the best ones . 
  recently i ' v learned that apparently you supposed to put [ the sweet tube milk ] ( http://www.hipernet24.pl/sklep/img_items/b/107/10795.jpg ) into coffee instead of eating it out from the tube as a snack, 
  is n't that a standard ? 
  / edit : since apparently it 's not standard - some also got 3rd option , where it 's not fully open , but let 's air in [ pic ] ( http://imgur.com/9euyoha ), 
  well we do n't really have the left ; ) atm po , pis and kukiz are the ones called populist most, 
  it 's a new business orientated project , but so far they are rather disapointing, 
  that 's true, 
   but no actions , projects or incentives least does n't mean non . 
  votting against/for , submiting changes to other projects is also an action as for leadership is ignorant and uninformed i do n't think they are worse in this department compared to others . 
  yes so far they did little to nothing ( involvement in kod and being against pis is pretty much only thing they done so far ) , disapointing their voters, 
  like everywhere - you need to weigh pros and cons and decide who you trust most . 
  you can show each party in bad light very easly . 
  maniek1188 's description is n't very obejctive to begin with, 
   stereotype that people stop supporting korwin upon reaching puberty is a bit exaggerated upon getting first job would be more accurate, 
  . n is socialist and populist ? 
  oo  he gets voters from students and other educated people of new generation , who are n't brainwashed by the mass media you mean edgy highschoolers/early uni who enter politics for the first time , having no knowladge about anything signing up for anything that promotes itself as not mainstream, 
  [ average polls over time ] ( http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/ ), 
  what is small for you ? 
  pis steorotypes stand firmly, 
  nothing special, 
  if you extend to predecessors rus is one of the oldest country in europe . 
  kiev , novgorod and st.petersburg and moscov later on were pretty big cities, 
  i misses out on polish glorious letters \u0105 , \u0119 , \u015b , \u0107 , \u0142, 
  turkey and kurdistan ? 
  [  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5xb-erk4lo ), 
  it 's and oil state after all . 
  considering it 's size it 's a corruption miracle that they are not on eu levels, 
  same here . 
  we have a saying ( back from around 20 years ago ) that on foreign land you need to keep far from other poles as they will try to fuck you up, 
  wow ukraine got so close to moldova, 
  i looked at it from `` similarities between nations/countries '' rather than `` general perception '', 
  [ tesco ] ( http://ezakupy.tesco.pl/pl-pl/productdetail/productdetail/2003009824750 ) : 13,99 z\u0142 = 3,17 eur ( 23,32 z\u0142 / kg = 5,28 eur/kg ), 
  what 's weirder there 's no russian cities either, 
  it 's pretty weird that some cities popped up to the top out of nowhere eg . 
   what to say about belarus ? 
  similar language and history , same cuisine , mentality . 
  they cut themselves away from the world , but that does n't mean they are not similar . 
  i may be biased on this since i come from podlasie, 
  that 's why i said it 's a tough decision - i meant between most neighbours , not only between slovakia and belarus, 
  it 's literally the same with them + they got very similar language ( if they actually speak belarusian instead of russian ), 
  hey they do n't have much recognition on the internet, 
  friendship is magic : [ hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) - both nations do n't really know much about each other , but due to having the rhyme engraved since childhood there are certain expectations , kind of like a positive steorotype : ) ; recently it 's also more visible politically culturally : it 's pretty hard pick - i would say either belarus ( which is funny considering how separated we are ) or slovakia - very similar language and mentality from further countries - it would probably be ireland - another alcoholic catholic potato eaters / edit : anyway no matter how similar we are to anyone [ we got no friends ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6pwmc7o.png ) and [ noone likes us ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uapejka.png ), 
   by our polish farmers is n't everything polish considered bad ? 
  and who invited them there ? 
  touch\u00e9 ; with prussia also pretty hilarious as in some sense it 's poland that created prussia, 
  it 's sad for brazilians to lose a colony in europe , not many countries achieved such feat , 
  and this war of mine - [ teaser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxf1seopije ) ; [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=balbuyotxqm ) ; 2 awesome songs used < 3, 
  [ oil industry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignacy_%c5%81ukasiewicz#petroleum_industry_and_oil_lamp ), 
  even in the uk ? 
  face untouched by thought, 
  that depends on the context though, 
   ukraine and belarus are made up countries wel ... 
  they are just offsprings of territory changes between poland and russia ; ), 
  it 's the most standard one here, 
  few other from this project : - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trwo1xbv6e - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvkzyul7ubq - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4gijf7poiu - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irklhvhcrc8, 
  as you know polish amoeba is moving west each few centuries, 
  you are saying that to a pole , 
  the above average rises after the show are more interesting - austria +88 % - hungary +80 % , 
  https://youtu.be/amgw54hbos0?t=4m55s [ larger context ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ) ( polish 2014 entry ), 
  flavoured vodka eg . 
  everyone on the same day when it starts to snow , 
   and if someone does n't change tires , he does n't change winter tires to summer tires , not the other way around . 
  you would be surprised, 
  while it 's not mandatory , everyone changes them . 
  that may change if winters will be like this one, 
  imagine the ensuing butthurt, 
  also alphabet itself is n't the same - we do n't have q , v and x while english does n't have \u0105 , \u0119 , \u015b , \u0107 , \u017a , \u017c , \u0142 , \u00f3 , \u0144 and double letters : sz , cz , d\u017c , d\u017a , dz, 
   belarus - hviterussland it 's just translation though, 
  [ sveti stefan ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=sveti+stefan&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=915&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjl1dsgwd_mahwjoswkhf9eapmq_auibigb ) and [ kotor ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=kotor&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi0xy61wt_mahxjvswkhceicveq_auiccgc&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=915 ) looks cool, 
  you also call poland lenkija , belarus gudija , finland suomija , hungary vengrija, 
  not directly , it 's the quickest , shortest way to describe it though, 
  use google translator to check how it 's pronounced https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walhaz / edit : and bonus : weirdly enough it has similar root to w\u0142osy ( = hair ) , which is source of kids jokes, 
  polish and most other european languages ( including ones using other writing systems ) are phonetic - letters used correspond with sounds aka you read as it 's written . 
  in english , however not so much - letters sound differently depending on word and some are silent ( french has the same problem ) . 
  it 's what makes english hard for foreigners [ this satirical video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpzaabmozs0 ) address the problem, 
   poland is puola  hungary is unkari  chezchia is t\u0161ekki  spain is espanja  greece is kreikka  norway is norja  ireland is irlanti  china is kiina i do n't think they count as different, 
  i though it refered only to polish-lithuianian commonwealth, 
  lithuanians , turks ( used to ) , armenians and iranians also use that kind of name for poland ( look up my post itt ), 
  most different ones from english - niemcy - germany - w\u0142ochy - italy - w\u0119gry - hugary - gruzja - georgia - holandia - the netherlands rest is pretty much the same ( same root eg . 
  hiszpania - spain , or direct translation eg . 
  czarnog\u00f3ra - montenegro ) ; [ map of europe in polish ] ( http://www.travelin.pl/galeria/mapa-europy.png ) in reverse poland also has different name ( aka aside from thing similar to poland ) that comes from the word lech/lach/lendians eg . 
  - lenkija in lithuanian - ** lengyel ** orsz\u00e1g in hungarian - lehistan/lehastan/lahestan in turkish , armenian and persian also when talking about the state - instead of iii republic of poland , the state is called iii rzeczpospolita polska ( = the 3rd commonwealth of poland ), 
  montenegro or slovenia probably as they are slow and beautiful, 
  sketches are pretty weak , but in case of g\u00f3rski , he makes great , unexpected remarks on the fly . 
  from sketches [ this one ( heaven ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_p5_bllkfu ) , [ baptism of poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxya5d4h_u8 ) or [ tent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjr_u_omcfg ) by neon\u00f3wka , especially roman \u017burek, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4jkrxm/bucharest_from_above/ was faster, 
  come on katarzyna pakosi\u0144ska ( for her contagious laugh ; [ aria with a laugh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zskym8cctu ) ) , robert g\u00f3rski and roman \u017burek are great, 
   and do n't have slavic genes no such thing really, 
   english was nice , why ca n't more languages be like it ? 
  except for retarded alphabet . 
  had it not been for global use of the lang i would never touch it, 
  so at least learn some dumka funnily one of the most popular is in [ polish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcxakhwsl6o ) and [ cover in ukrainian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg28nydhf30 ) ( [ another cover in ukrainian for two voices ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13zurulfrji ) ) ; and cool random ukrainian song as a bonus : [ \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0439 -- \u0422\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0439 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgqlsobiteq ) and [ \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0447\u043a\u043e\u043c ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjnwmfhtgzi ), 
  hmm for the same reason hungary , lithuania , latvia , estonia , finland , germany etc is n't - bordering slavic countries does n't make you a slavic country . 
  the distinction comes from language - if the language is slavic than the country is slavic . 
  [ romanian language sample ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gidfhejo1a ) - it 's closer to italian , spanish or french than russian , polish or serbian, 
   ukranian learning russian ( or even polish ) would be a more reasonable option - most people in ukraine know or at least understand russian ( with polish it 's a harder ) , but still - learning either you would have access to far more speakers and stil make your way around ukraine ( especially with russian ), 
  use search, 
  russia is already on that : [ world championship tank biathlon 2015 finals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjodew0owps ), 
  buy back polmos bia\u0142ystok to make it great again !, 
  polan got 3rd !,
