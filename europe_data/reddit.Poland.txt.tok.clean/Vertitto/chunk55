  i find it weird couse non of my friends or family ever voted in this type of shows, 
  we would have to ban uk from competition and force ireland to sing in english, 
   vote for your neighbours you vote ? 
  imagine all the companies are state owned , communism ends and companies are being privatised . 
  nomal folk obviously do n't have capital to buy them , so who buys the companies ? 
  to add some olive to fire you got ex-commies ( party members , officials or secret police ) who need to secure their place in the new world it was pretty shitty time in whole eastern block . 
  transformation ( ' 90 , transition from communism to capitalism ) is like eastern european version of american prohibition, 
  [ some of it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqojvi8xua0 ) is halal, 
  accordig to wiki he town is n't source of pollution , but is unable to filter the air coming from previously mentioned gop, 
  every eu + eea country though, 
  actually we are pretty `` ok '' when it comes to greenhouse emissions ( both nomial and per capita ) 2013 : [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/greenhouse_gas_emission_statistics ) [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions ) our problem is that we are not lowering it as fast as other european countries, 
  i do n't think it was even ever close to chinese level, 
   when the air in poland is unbearable southern poland . 
   ut the pollution is n't that big and it 's not much higher than in other cities . 
  enough to spown steorotypes that people need machetes to move through the air ; ), 
  i usually listen to my own cd . 
  no aux ; ( from radio i enjoy : - rmf classic ( classical , movie music or sung poetry ) http://www.rmfon.pl/play,7 - 3rd program of national radio ( often rock , metal , blues , jazz , some alternative , some new , lesser known bands ) ; http://player.polskieradio.pl/-3 - radio nadzieja ( `` radio hope '' , it 's small local station in my hometown , it 's a catholic radio , but if you skip through the prayers , they play lot of good music - lot of , ' 80 , '90 and '00 hits ) ; http://radionadzieja.pl/ ( top right `` s\u0142uchaj nas on-line ! '' ), 
  it 's where the coal mines + coal power plants + other heavy industry is located . 
  most of the cities on the list are actually part of mega-city around katowice ( look up google maps , [ gop wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upper_silesian_industrial_region ) ) . 
  in terms of krak\u00f3w main reason is that the city is in a valley cousing the smog to pile up , especially during winter . 
  home heating also adds to the problem , but i believe it 's not the core of the problem ( in most entries on the list ), 
  it 's a standard for many eu projects, 
  i just went out of companies where state had big ownership + financial sector and got some from it and small ones from mwig and nc + those that planned to pay dividends . 
  was not enough , capital withdrawal went across the board ;( the dividends at least make things a lil better ( not included in previous statement ), 
  duda directly not so much , but fact of pis getting ahead in polls with their ingenious ideas like saving polish coal mines via energetic sector or taxing banks/retail and month by month producing more absurd ideas is a big yellow-to-red light for many investors, 
  #goodchange i lost around 18 % on my stocks portfolio since duda 's win , dumb me . 
  it will take time to work that back ; ( graph : [ wig20 5year ] ( http://stooq.pl/c/?s=wig20&amp;c=5y&amp;t=l&amp;a=lg ) ; [ whole wig ] ( http://stooq.pl/c/?s=wig&amp;c=5y&amp;t=l&amp;a=lg ) for comparison, 
  was way better imo ( [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl5rmmpihp8 ) ) . 
  szpak 's one is just `` default eurovision song '' , nothing special, 
  go to krak\u00f3w , poland and prague , czech or prague and vienna also keep in mind thanksgiving is not a thing in pretty much anywhere in europe ( according to wiki it 's only uk and netherlands ), 
  not voting ; ) anyway i did n't know russian minority is pretty same size as polish there ( 2011 ), 
  noone voting for polan, 
  that 's really weird , context ? 
  too bad he uploads his vids so rarely, 
  hey croats is polan really your close friend ? 
  couse that would mean polan has a friend !, 
  couse russia has shit ton of land on the map and puting aussies on water is not an option ( just becouse ), 
  easing tension between russia and ukraine, 
  poland - very small % of pkb , but pretty significant % of billionaire wealth . 
  it would be cool if the interactive graph also included ration between crony and non-crony, 
  number for gendarmerie ? 
  that 's pretty weird . 
  what 's their role in turkey ? 
  with the amount of stuff some people buy i wonder why do n't they just go to the wholesale instead, 
  have n't heard of any . 
  i did n't know such thing even exist . 
  got a bit confused when i saw eu flags all over the city, 
  you can get the same effect by lowering vat on daily life articles ( or anything that lowers cost of living - food , clothes , housing etc ) , cheaper housing for families , providing better , more accesible daycare for children or secured employment contracts . 
  or by carrying out tech/langugae curses for kids . 
  problems with straight donations like 500 + is that is that poor people still stay poor and just breed more children . 
  if inflation hits or budgets gets in trubble ( pension system is failing atm ) you get back to where you started or worse ( sorry for a bit convoluted post , but i 'm pretty tired now , i hope you got the gist of what i mean ), 
  does n't have the same market position & strengh though . 
  that 's a pretty big logic leap, 
  not into a possition of germany of uk , but italy or ireland is doable ( in longer time frame ofc like 20 + ) . 
  it needs serious reforms and good gov though, 
  a bill has been passed that allows police/special forces to access phone/internet data more easly, 
  i had impression that only romania and bulgaria were left missing out from the continental eu, 
  the thing is iirc that those quota refugees were supposed to be paid by eu so it 's being robbed less than 500 +  to islamist 23 year olds who want my family dead . 
  and please stop using such strawmens , they make you look like a moron, 
  ~ ~ and croatia ~ ~ i was wrong, 
  but : - no tribunal bullshit - no invigilation increase - no 500 + ( i 'm for helping families , but 500 + is the dumbest way you can go about it - cousing more problems than profits ) - no bullshit laws ( like those regarding farmland and windmills ) - no bullshit worker union ass liking ( coal mines ) - foreign relations would be in tact - no legitimising for `` saint lech parades '' you could probably add more going into details , but all that for taking a small group of people that may carry terrotist risk ? 
  organising the youth days in krak\u00f3w has far more terrotist risk attatched to it, 
  you could use the exact same argument had it been in normal/slower speed, 
  there 's no typo there , it is as it 's supposed to be, 
   which makes pis the better choice over po . 
  symbolic act is more important than actually running the country ? 
  this the only thing possitive about pis , but in no way is even close to outweigh the damage they are doing, 
   right now there are almost no big polish enterprises that are not funded by gov. 
  eee what ? 
  ever visited wse ? 
  we got big enterprises , just very few glabal scale players, 
   is given as a proof of large number of people and you can get this feeling because you do n't see actual moving speed . 
  like it matters . 
  you see the weave of poeple , tempo at which they move ( in reasonable speeds ofc ) does n't matter, 
  according to the internets whole west is now emigrating to the last white muslim-free strongholds of v4 as the caliphate is being built in west : ^ ), 
   the polish government are more than happy to accept money from the eu when it benefit them that 's only a one side of coin . 
  the money is sort of compensation for letting more advanced economies easly into polish market  the money required to cover from polands share of the handling of immigrants could be taken from their grants , with interest . 
  if you would go by this route , poland should be able in turn put additional tax on eu companies doing business in poland, 
  they accept refugees , just not from quota, 
  it 's not so much to block them , like it happens when you throw more solid stuff, 
  nothing special really . 
  just the flag i got used to and feel comfortable with . 
  i like how they look on streets on summer holidays - it looks great on green trees background, 
  so the ops question should be `` why do countries with shitty plumbing do n't use bidets ? '', 
  [ map for us visa waiver programme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_waiver_program#/media/file:visa_policy_of_the_usa.png ), 
   gdynia has ships , aquarium , eve 's caldari style building and a seaside promenade at the end of which you can make a fireplace also some clubs at the beach, 
  and if you are polish you need a luck in visa lottery, 
  eee i expected something new, 
  [ queen of poland ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/naj%c5%9bwi%c4%99tsza_maryja_panna_kr%c3%b3lowa_polski ) ( wiki in polish though ), 
  ofc . 
  reversed : as for greece they got shitty plumbing that can not handle paper . 
  i assume the plumbing may be a reason for using bidets, 
  how is it a manipulation ? 
  they do n't mention how many people were there according to them - they just gave the numbers posted by various sources and put a timelapse vid, 
  italy though ? 
  wow it 's literally a copy pase of the german one, 
  so it may be an international chain after all . 
  on fast google search i just could n't find any firm indicator that it 's part of something bigger, 
  can not think of such food chain north fish mayby ( i though it was some scandinavian chain ), 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65swzhabes `` soviet union and russia did nothing wrong , we only help , why do they hate us ? '',
