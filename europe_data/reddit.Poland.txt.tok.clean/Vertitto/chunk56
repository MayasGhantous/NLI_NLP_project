  euro '12 in poland was best example of those `` special '' feelings, 
  even many europeans can not tell which baltic country is where exactly, 
  he had it in mind , but wrote something different, 
  are those done by eu or by random shitposters ? 
  anyone got decent aerial shots ? 
  there were 3 marches today - kod and opposition march ( it 's the big one , the article is about it ) - schuman 's parade ( pro-eu ) - `` poland , have courage ! '', 
  march - march organised by far-right nationalist movement ( anti-eu ), 
  what the hell ? 
  if you feel offended then sorry . 
  at no point i meant to offend . 
  it 's a forum , the posts are not only for us but for everyone that reads the thread . 
  i dunno why you are so butthurt about being pointed out a mistake, 
  i dunno on what level your knowladge is . 
  since what you ' v written is nonsense it 's safer to correct, 
  to build up on other responses - it does n't present poland having high gdp , it only shows how much it has risen, 
  part of iron curtain ? 
  lol as much as britain was eastern block/warsaw pact are the terms you are looking for, 
   there is no european nationally that 's not entirely true . 
  it 's not fully developed nationality , but something that bring people together, 
  i hope you are awere that hungary was not part of ussr, 
  norway is part of nearly all stats done by eu, 
  done ,  do you prefer extreme right or left what kind of question is that ? 
  oo also you got official stats for opinion about gov from eurobarometer iirc . 
  so you can look up how reddit fares vs general population, 
   poland [ there be some forests ] ( http://www.efi.int/files/images/virtual_library/jrc_map.png ), 
  or mayby a [ pole ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/polak-wsrod-kandydatow-na-burmistrza-londynu-3524182.html ) ( it 's in polish , it 's the polish aristocrat that [ challenged farage to a sabre duel ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/22/polish-prince-challenges-nigel-farage-to-a-sword-duel-over-immig/ ) ), 
   decent it 's a good term , not fast, 
  i would describe it as `` expected '', 
  it 's never considered as fast growth though, 
  lucky you : ), 
  still , 2-3 % is not that fast even among developed economies, 
  take the world into account , not only eu, 
  argh the tittle why the f `` muslim '' is relevant ? 
  it 's not like the law lets everyone wear niqabs except muslims ... 
  i would imagine czech to be above 3 % . 
  after all you are like poland , but better ; ), 
   so fast 2-3 % is barely moving , it is more of stagantion tbh . 
  adding `` so fast '' make it look like a sarcasm / edit : ok i back from my words partially - averege annual growth for high income countires by ( world bank ) for 2010-2014 is 1,9 % , which would make 2-3 % brackets fast . 
  but when it comes to greece 2-3 % is not special, 
   italy  so weak confirmed ( context : `` what does xcountry ... '' maps ), 
  mayby in some villages just at the border, 
  or reversal in another way : `` do you think x likes poles '' kind of thing, 
  no event comes to my mind . 
  my first thought was arab spring making north african countries dangerous for vacation and shifting interest to turkey instead , but years do n't match up, 
  there 's much more to nationality than to skin colour, 
  i feel irish may have won had they been listed, 
  i believe light green would be better for neutral , as having neutral opinion is ok, 
  feb 2017 in [ linked source ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2017/k_021_17.pdf ) you can see comparisons with other years page 7 : change in possitive over the years page 8 : change in negative over the years, 
  it 's weird that estonia is even mentioned on the list, 
  yea and they ran of the next day , 
  only history with lithuania is shaky ( and it 's mostly due to after-ww1 events of recreating countries and [ polish -- lithuanian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_war ) ) , there 's no beef towards latvia/estonia , there 's even no steorotypes for those, 
  yea that 's pretty high % . 
  it 's strange that more people did n't went for neutral instead, 
  that 's very likely , 
  yea that 's weird possitive increased and negative decreased accross the whole board, 
  lazy op and lazy redditors make for best threads, 
  [ same place now ] ( https://youtu.be/t-lxwwhmwho?t=17m17s ) ( ~ 17min 17s - 18min10s ), 
   it would take about 5 seconds ** in the us ** to get every participating police officer suspended over unlawful detention case closed  fyi , here 's how this situation would be interpreted in civilized places just please . 
  it sounds especially hilarious from an american where police can shot you during a routine car control for not showing your arms or leaving the car . 
   the police does not have powers to force people to do that , if you are n't aware . 
  news for you then - it has and at that not only police but also most uniformed services including army , municipal police , border guard , military gendarmerie , customs service or even forest guard ( in their designated area/events ) , especially in case of serious case like drug raid . 
  also there 's no mentioning of forcing anything even freaking mundaine thing like taking an exam you may be asked to get lined up and leave your belongings somewhere else and how do you behave in case of fire drill ? 
  is it also considered a unlawful and unfair practise to line all people up and leave the building into the designated evacuation point ? 
  why would you show and sort it as monies per capita ? 
  % of budget or gdp would be more reasonable imo, 
  hmm never seen the brand in poland, 
  no law or fairness is breached here ( unless there 's something more to the case than the title states ), 
  or you are oversensitive sheltered type person, 
  just france - french guiana is part of france, 
  this is exactly it - kids had to stand for a bit and you are making it sound as if some outragous harm was done or they were humiliated in some way . 
  i just hate when people are overblowing random stuff out of proportion, 
  you are making fuss about a non issue, 
  you say as if it was some bad thing . 
  i wonder if going outside during school hours is also so bad for you since they also do that in prison , or having to wait in pairs for teacher before you enter the classroom ? 
  or designated time for a meal ? 
  literally nazi practise , they should bring that to hague, 
  lol, 
  and what 's special about it ? 
  [ view from above ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ykk5w ) drone vids : - [ winter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z_zepgdk14 ) - [ summer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgmkecdzov8 ), 
  you mean european belarus , 
  sneaky belarus, 
  meanwhile 3city has classic przedwiosnie , just 2nd autumn atm - grey and foggy . 
  weekend is supposed to be warmer though, 
  you already got spring ? 
  oo thread is month or two to early, 
  iceland produced a world of higher population and more thrilling economy than itself, 
  nope . 
  map shows top djs from spotify from end of 2016 iirc, 
  got some comments vs up/down votes stats to compare ? 
  most reddit users are `` read-only '' users that do not comment another thing posts do n't have fixed points . 
  even if you will refresh you comments from 3 months ago they can change on each refresh by few points, 
  wow armenia would tripple its size ( today 's size ), 
  trigger mode off version : mediterranean poland, 
  woop ^ woop ^ woop ^ woop, 
  institutions like imf are also an empire then ? 
  anyway it 's a hard to define what can be considered a country , there 's ton of blurry lines . 
  for one german and polish food is pretty much the same, 
  i would like to laugh at turkey , but we are not that much better atm ... 
  and in the same time it 's marked as most seccesion-robust region, 
  pretty close to 50/50 political support is around 30-37 % for pis vs rest with some wild cards like k15 ( ~ 8 % ) and psl ( ~ 5 % ) that can go either way depending on their mood http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/,
