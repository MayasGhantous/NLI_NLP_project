  tvn is considered to be polar opposite to pis-run tvp . 
  polsat is more centrish , but leaning towards tvn direction . 
  nearly anything is better than currect tvp - pis just turned it into polish version of rt - full on gov propaganda . 
  ton of people are stopping watching news anyway, 
  not everywhere and most people are economically illitereate spreading bullshit around, 
  there 's also 2 non-gov-owned channels ( polsat and tvn ) among the `` free '' channels stats for q4 2016 : - polsat 11,8 % - tvp1 10,8 % - tvn 10,6 % - tvp2 8,5 % source : [ quartly tvmarket report by gov agency ( in polish ) ] ( http://www.krrit.gov.pl/data/files/_public/portals/0/nadawcy/aktualnosci/rynek-telewizyjny-w-iv-kwartale--2016.pdf ) audience for news segements : - wiadomo\u015bci ( tvp1 , main daily news ) 2,74 mln - fakty ( tvn , main daily news ) 2,48 mln - teleexpress ( tvp1 , shorter , more trivia daily news ) 2,4 mln - wydarzenia ( polsat , main daily news ) 1,71 mln - panorama ( tvp2 , main daily news ) 1,1 mln source 1-20 .09.2016 r. [ audience report based on data from nielsen audience measurement agency by gazeta.pl / wp.pl ] ( http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/7,114883,20728100,nowy-ranking-ogladalnosci-programow-informacyjnych-kto.html ) ( you can compare it to the same period from last year ), 
  exactly, 
  not really , freedom of movement wins for the reason . 
  economically i feel the most prevelant opinion is that country got sold to germany and it 's being robbed, 
  those borders lol, 
   maybe the pope can calm down ultra-catholic kaczynski ( that looks like a ` young ' ratzinger ) the fake leftist pope ? 
   this sub internet in general, 
  are n't those courses in nativ langs though ? 
  serbia - croatia would be bigger one i guess also greece - turkey, 
  both dill and parsley suck . 
  i dunno what people adding them think, 
  mayby couse ukrainians rarely speak pure ukrainian and pretty much all of them speak russian, 
  from learning swedish we could n't say if it was norwegian or swedish from listening . 
  only letters gave it away, 
  actually not many . 
  most ukrainians in poland are standard emigrants, 
  belarus though has such on/off relation with russia since forever . 
  we will see if it 's just rumbling or they indeed want to leave russia, 
  i do n't think we had them, 
  it used to be a big problem around ' 90-early ' 00 . 
  while there are still old ones , i feel there 's not many new appearing, 
  hey look at your neighbours , you are the brightest in the pack , 
  damn this is scary, 
  are cartoons ok ? 
  never heard it at a wedding, 
  latvia and austria ? 
  like wtf czechs ? 
  for lithuania-lativa i could bet that you labeled them wrong, 
   do the greek know any countries besides us and themself ? 
  turkey ? 
  it 's just a link to a forum expected some end game map result or something, 
  made by some big recognisable media outlet not random ytuber + bonus for good trump voice, 
  not official this one as bad as previous one, 
  so do we : - [ heathers ] ( http://czasnawnetrze.pl/i/ad02nzumdz05mda=/29014a59/15113-wrzosowisko.jpg ) - [ crocuses ] ( http://www.planetagor.pl/img/upload_pic/2_2.png ), 
  just like greeks planted trees ? 
  [ they went even further ] ( https://i.imgur.com/4vikdz4.png ), 
  why was the previous one deleted ? 
  is n't the adjective arabic ? 
  we are not even trying to hide it , everyone knows we are taking over belarus and western ukraine, 
   you would have to be retarded if you do n't know camps were nazi built and operated . 
  you would literally had to be born on isolated island and know nothing about history . 
  you would be surprised how often that happens . 
   or because they were n't polish but german this, 
  eastern europe : use cyrylic , is orthodox and got carpets hanging on walls, 
  it 's same in polish - you use `` w [ name of the country ] '' , but for ukraine it 's `` na ukrainie '', 
   this will trigger pretty much everyone who can speak ukrainian . 
  not that many then , 
  let 's combine `` how to trigger europe '' with `` most x city of y '' , 
  1 . countries that are part of eu have , but eu itself does n't, 
  economic instability is coused by evil west, 
  but shhh noone will notice, 
  and a pic showing warsaw old town , 
  add some context cosue picture does n't show anything that would be stupid nor provoking, 
  it 's called german , dutch , but swedish ? 
  never heard that, 
   `` so you are eastern czechia or upper hungary ? '', 
  southern poland obviously, 
  it 's like that in ton of languages, 
   i encountered a russian couple asking me a question in russian when they heard me speaking slovak . . in fucking greece . 
  wtf . 
  i do n't understand you and it 's a bit rude . 
  but you know russian and just do n't want to speak it, 
  that 's a trigger for europe in general, 
   or better , moldova . 
  it 's ment to be annoying though , 
  nice try , but that 's not how it works, 
   paris would anyone vote for paris aside from mayby french ? 
  is partly in europe , but not european, 
  i guess [ przy\u015bpiewka byle jaka o europejsko\u015bci polaka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uab3gs0e_m4 ) ( = slapdash song about polish europeanness ) by jacek kaczmarski sums polish mentality pretty well . 
  it 's quite hard to translate , chorus more or less :  anyhow , anything ,  just to make it go  either straight or backwards ,  just to have it done ,  anywhere , for anywho  anyhow '' or last stanza with last version of the chorus :  however you would lok at it - i 'm a pole :  free spirit and free will  berlin , paris or milan  do n't even get close . 
   i am polish !, 
   i will fulfill my historical role anyway ------------------------  anyhow , anything ,  just there to be no obstacles !, 
   just to be in mood for it  and for it to also be profitable !, 
   anyhow ... 
  in short : no matter what you do you will still be better paid in western countries both nominally and in disposable income,

  brexit did n't even happen yet ( and may even not happen at all ) . 
  so far there was only a referendum i recommand to open wikipedia/yt and write each country ( like one per day ) in and get some general idea , there 's ton of prmo vids and travel vlogs out there . 
  from channels i would recommand [ walter 's world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/woltersworld/playlists ) - he does lot of vids on european countries from american 's perspective, 
  in what way ? 
  that 's pretty general question you may find some answers here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5sxjrc/cultural_exchange_with_rsingapore/ddixvvb/ from other threads : - [ how does the education system work in your country ?

   pickpockets it 's a bit of problem in turisty places like paris , rome or madrid ( in crowded places like metro or near the sights ) . 
  need to look after your stuff in cheaper hotels in countries like ukraine still the saftiest continent , depends on country , in general safe .
