  clean public space - we are getting closer to contries like dennmark , belarus or germany , but still there 's lot of work to do , it 's seems nearly impossible to make people clean after their dogs, 
  i do n't think anywhere in europe people wear shoes in homes ( mayby southern countries ? ) . 
  you always have to take them down while entering , sometimes you will be given some slippers  do they wear them while sleeping ? 
  lol no , that sounds really weird, 
  standard is 8:00 , rarely 7:15 ( like for some extra lessons ) university is random - you can have a full day from 7:15 to even 21:00 and the next day one lecture at 13:00,

  it was caused by front from north that came with hummid air , strong winds , cold temperatures resulting in snow storms . 
  from 1.01.1979 whole country was paralysed by the snow and freezing temperatures . 
  a state of natural disaster was announced in gda\u0144sk voivodeship . 
  train tracks got frozen and started to break .

  army was delegated to help with the snow using tanks and other heavy machinery . 
  public transport in most towns was not working . 
  in some regions busses were going through tunnels made of snow .

  # / / will be different from country to country / /  what do you guys think of russians ? 
  nagative towards russian state/politics , been pretty much in bad relations/war since both countries exist - pretty much our national archenemy . 
  now seen as a country that still tries to remain revelent by weaving its guns/oil contracts , distorted by soviet mentality . 
  russian culture ( classical music , literature ) is quite popular . 
  russians are liked as long as politics-history is not mentioned  singapire has been getting very popular with europeans recently along with japan and s.korea it 's seen as a place egzotic , oriental place to make money , but very few people who been there would like to start a family there,

  in terms of poland over your education you get to learn 2 or 3 languages . 
  you start from english ( to much lesser exten german ) , later you need to pick 2nd foreign ( i could chose from german , french and russian ) and on university had 3rd ( could pick from german , french , russian , spanish and swedish ) generally big chunk of people speak 1 foreign ( usually english or german ) , it 's pretty rare to meet people who speak more [ stats map ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/median-of-languages.jpg ),

  leader in what ? 
  wrong shade of red in our flag on the thumbnail , it should be more `` pinkish '' - closer to the us one expected something better , the narrator has a really annoying voice, 
   hrvatska + polan , we just use `` ch '' instead of `` h '' ( it 's the same sound ) - chorwacja, 
  do you really think a printed copypasta from random people is a cool idea for a present ? 
  what the hell is with this creepy presents train, 
  is you not europeo country ? 
  what is you doings here down ? 
  belarus is not that poor though, 
  but the reasoning behind it is opposite, 
  english does n't mean uk/american version , pretty much all big news outlets got some kind english versions . 
  also burden of translating makes at least people think if it 's worth to post in the first place, 
  that 's strange considering british/americans feel being not wanted , massively downvoted here, 
  noone watches the games , but there are people waiting for new movie trailers or funny ads . 
  in news it 's usually about how much companies are willing to pay during this time , pretty much nothing about the game, 
  mayby that was just someone from eastern poland  oh wait , stupid me - i ' v read it as if they were speaking ukrainian and you polish . 
  nvm i 'm retarded, 
   a normal cable subscription would include german , french , italian , british , some eastern european and arabic channels in addition to a handful of maltese ones .

  turkish or french were played on maltese channels,

   [ 0:03 ] - the lady is shouting something like lsd . 
  she screams the band 's name - okean elzy, 
  personaly it 's either neutral or possitive . 
  did not have much interaction - one cute ukrainian girl working with me and i think one of the shop assistants in the shop nearby is ukrainian , my brother has some ukrainian dudes studying with him ( been partying with them once ) and we invited a group from ukraine & belarus for our fencing tournament few months ago . 
  yea ofc . 
  i just want to highlight some things so people are awere it 's not so picture perfect,

  you change a into e and you are pretty much there, 
  polish `` dzi\u0119ki '' is pretty close, 
  you do n't do that ? 
  the finnish one is great , 
   i 'd say it 's because much of europe is ancient what ? 
  there 's just few ancient things in europe i guess you meant old/medival/renaissance / baroque etc, 
   then what is this ? 
  independence march that happens each year . 
  sure most of them are not found of muslims and mostly becouse of what the `` refuggees '' were representing in western and southern europe  i do n't think it 's unlikely that the refugees left because polish people are so openly hostile to them . 
  that 's not the reason they gave though, 
   - take eu aid  - use free market to it 's fullest extent , grow really well that goes both ways - in short western countries buy a right to a market with privileged position . 
  in everyday life it 's as if you bought a vip cupon letting you enter a 70 % discount zone . 
  from our side we are at big disadvantage at start with having a chance to make something out of the funds given . 
  as for movement of people we lower the unemployment , but suffer immense braindrain in return  - asked to take some refugees  - no , we do n't want those dirty brown people ; germany is opressing us help !, 
  ask to take some `` refuggees '' that did n't want to come in the first place .
