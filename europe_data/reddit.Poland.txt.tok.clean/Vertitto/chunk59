  we were ( and still are ) offering help . 
  there were additinaly few ngos , but their initiative died pretty fast when most of the people for whom they scured work , education , pay and housing either left for germany/swden the next day or went back to syria, 
   selfish nation still have not said anything to back that up  i hope you get treated like you have treated the syrians . 
  that would be pretty good - we offered them refugee and send humanitarian aid . 
  only thing we were against was forced quotas ( of people who did n't want to come ), 
   iran dunno if uk , france and germany would be happy about worsening relations with saudis, 
   thief mentality ; only take , never give . 
  and yet we are the ones being on 0 or negative, 
  lol and how about setting up camps and strenghten up border control along with reginstering people for a start , like hungary and poland proposed , a ? 
  stop being so deep up your ass, 
  i can only think of sweden/norway, 
   also your government severly pissed everyone off that you like getting the benefits of being in the eu but scream opression at the top of your lungs when we ask you to share the burden of asylum seekers , that is major league selfish . 
  please drop this dumb idea .

   - very much for significant reform of the eu more or less along the lines of diem25 's thinking . 
   - for military cooperation within europe rather than basing our defensive strategy on us .
