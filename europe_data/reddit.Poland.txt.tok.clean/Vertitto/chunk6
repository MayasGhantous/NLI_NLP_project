  is it really a hungarian thing ? 
  it 's also pretty common in polish , especially in spoken language . 
  it sounds more formal, 
  it 's also often done in poland, 
  macedonians stole our '' - ski/a '' surname endings ? 
  assholes, 
   russian cities russian is a wrong word here . 
  dunno how it would be in english , but the term is `` rusini '' or `` ruscy '' ( `` matka ** ruskich ** miast '' as opposed to `` matka ** rosyjskich ** miast '' = mother of russian cities ) in polish . 
  ruscy/rusini is term for east-slavic nations , while rosjanie is term for russians, 
  that does n't mean they they can not increase to 10 % gdp and fund it from debt , 
  hmm pretty good idea for making money and helping the world in the same time . 
  i wonder if you would get prosecuded for such thing in poland, 
  bottomless bag of eternal debt is also a good place to look for financing things, 
  turkey-kurd conflict seems a bit weird to me . 
  i can not understand why do n't turks help kurds - it 's good opportunity to create a decent ally and a buffor for the middle east . 
  they could even use kurds as a bold land grab opportunity for the oil farms in syria and iraq by supporting kurds and making joined country with them ( kind of like belgium works ), 
   full spectrum dare to say a rainbow of parties, 
  for poland i guess it 's pretty even between germans , russians ( `` pole , german and russian walks into a bar '' type jokes ) and jews ( there 's tons of those , i ' v had a whole book of jew jokes once , funnily enough most of them were written by the polish jews themselves ) . 
  i thought it 's supposed to be latvia, 
  3rd thread about this , waiting for me ... 
  i would love if polish companies jumped on the iran bandwagon asap, 
   sorry but in some languages the ~ ~ informal ~ ~ ** formal ** name of the netherlands sound more like holland ( romanian : olanda ), 
  so this is why germans got problems with it . 
  what sane person would dare to go against the tos, 
  what 's special about this ? 
  sea buffer  turkey buffer, 
  wow you could take a ferry to iran , neat . 
  direct connection with iran would be amazing - oil , iranain market , turisty things, 
   `` hra\u0165 '' ( to play ) - hraj !, 
  here it 's pretty much the same : `` gra\u0107 '' - graj !, 
  i expected more opel, 
  well not really eg . 
  poland was one of few countries where homosexualism was almost always legal ( minus times where law was enforced by another occupant country ) . 
  difference is that part of the world made a big jump wheras poland stays where it was, 
  they are called holland in shit load of countries . 
  no chance to fix that, 
  lukaszenko was right all along !, 
  poland is source of all evil and founding propaganda everywhere . 
  now even using euromonies, 
   russian rusin * or rurethanian * then there 's not russia yet then, 
  it already happened long time ago, 
  they are also not big chains . 
  most you can do is poll for top fast/street food per country, 
  and everywhere tbh , people prefer small , random local pizzeries or kebabs . 
  big chains are mostly for turists, 
  keyword : ** chain **, 
  hah if it was only the sub ... it 's a unifying baner for the whole continent, 
   research indicates that the motives for roma to emigrate do not fundamentally differ from those of non-roma : ** they look for employment , better living conditions and a better education for their children ** . 
  and to accomplish that they build 3rd-world-like ghettos , refuse to accept any job offers and do n't send their kids to school . 
  i do n't think he talks about the romas who are so hated across europe, 
  it 's based on weird notion that geographical center of europe is somewhere in central/western germany . 
  map projections and format get people confused . 
  [ this map shows size of europe better ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/extreme_points_of_europe.png ), 
  hard to say . 
  over the time that passed many institutions made `` what if '' plans , so from one side it would be worse if grecce left back then, 
  conspiracy !,

  will it work as punishment corner for countries that did n't fullfill the treety requirements ? 
  [ naming rights by neil degrasse tyson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdat98een5q ), 
  someone needs to take care of the retarded kid, 
  in reality it is only matter of willingness as there 's no punishment for neglecting it . 
  you can even keep fullfiling the erm2 stats for 20 years and all eu can do is say `` hey , it would be nice if you finally joined '', 
   that is why a eurozone exit puts a state in an institutional and legal limbo that it is the equivalent , without additional action , of leaving the eu . 
  leaving the eu ? 
  would n't the limbo rather mean going down one stop on the integration ladder ? 
  polish attitude thowards euro looks more or less like this : in general - yes , we plan to enter eurozone someday , that 's our long term goal , but not in the nearest future . 
  public opinion is like flag on the wind on such matters - it 's pretty random . 
  very low knowladge of economy & finances in our nation does n't help the cosue either - people are illiterate when it comes anything regarding economy/finances my personal opinion : our economy relays more on cheap labour force than on innovation , so having our own , `` cheaper '' currency is beneficial as for now ( also our national bank is pretty good at what it 's supposed to do ) . 
  until we redirect our economy to be more centered around new tech developement and gdppercapita/life standard gets closer to that of western/northen countries , there 's no point in even considering addoptiong the euro . 
  hmm iirc no treaty even considers any rules for exit - they kind of forgot about it . 
   grexit if anything they would leave the eurozone , leaving eu is completly different thing . 
  first can lead to 2nd , but equating the two is just wrong, 
   i 'm actually more worried about what would happen in warsaw or cracow than in atlanta or dallas you really think anything would happen ? 
  imo unless here would be some `` white-power true polish patriots '' , stares or some quiet snorky comments is all that could happen, 
  i do n't get why and how do some people make germany the bad one in this whole situation, 
  simple guide to russia : there 's moscow , there 's st.petersburg , there 's european russia ( till ural ) and there 's siberia, 
  ah the pre-war square , i would love if they rebuild the buildings that were part of the `` arcades '' eg .

  http://www.aliorbank.pl/en --  individuals --  account you want and look what 's needed ( poland is not in ez so you either make account in pln or foreign currency account ) best way to find big banks in other countries is going to country 's main stock exchange and look there . 
  banks are usually one of the biggest companies there, 
  you are awere that banks got sites on the internet and usually you can even chat with some employee ? 
  find a bank and look there ? 
   same way people people nowadays often name their kids with foreign names so that they sound `` cool '' ( but in reality it sounds more lame ) . 
  it 's still a thing ? 
  i thought that eneded in somewhere in 2000 . 
  now the old names are cool from what i hear, 
  depends on people you meet , can go both ways, 
  you will have to be satisfied with my wild guess until someone who really knows how it works comes  c has become k in ` monica ' but not ` clinton ' i guess couse monika is also a name in polish . 
  most of foreign names are left as they are in their native lang  and ` lewinsky ' has no case ending i got no idea what 's the rule for polish names that were americanized . 
  in this case polish standard version for her name would be monika lewi\u0144ska , in genitive it would be moniki lewi\u0144skiej . 
  as in polish , our languages are very flexible in making cute , diminutive forms of words on top of rich vocabulary,

  in europe we got the problem that some of them do n't want to integrate .
