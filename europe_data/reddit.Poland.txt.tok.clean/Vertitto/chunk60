  and what if whole neighbourhoods are doing that ? 
  glad to be coming from green parts of the country ( podlasie and 3city ) < 3, 
  you are mistaken, 
  you should at least view those by op / top rated ones instead of asking for already answered things for the 10th time, 
  first time on reddit ? 
  just like with previous one, 
  no actual forces were in japan so no, 
  becouse you do n't read , op said it 's a mistake, 
  it was n't , op said it 's a mistake, 
  like previous one - it was n't it 's intention to provide much information , just a general circlejerk thread , where at most you can get some info from comments, 
  then you would have to exclude pretty much all the conflicts from monarchy periods, 
  uk in the middle ages with dannes , it was mentioned in the previous thread [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cnut_the_great#conquest_of_england ) i remember it was also mentioned in the `` historia bez cenzury '' series ( looking for it ) : [ this episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oudcxl3zc0 ) ( it was mentioned also in another one , but i do n't remember which ), 
  that would be ukraine, 
  only latest yugo wars come to my mind . 
  keep in mind , just like with previous map it 's exeggerated, 
  belarusian sr is still belarus though also setting up eastern border just after ww1 also counts i guess, 
  hey we are only small part of that - it 's not us making `` every country needs to at least once invade polan '' jokes, 
  actually it kind of did during polish soviet war/after ww1 border establishing, 
  how else you would call that ? 
   also cossacks was always fighting against moscow and polish people for the ukraine liberty as well as for poland/lithuania and for moscow  it has different etymology it 's the most widely accepted one, 
  it makes it look as if poland and lithuania were part of kievian rus . 
  thye could have articulated it a bit better ( similar problem later on with the ussr collapse ) also 5:38 i gues he mean balkan not baltic also it may be the first video of russian history that highlighted polish accent so much cool vid overall, 
  it has ton of exegerations, 
  aka polish amoeba, 
  does n't mom and milf essentially refer to the same thing - mature women ? 
   was this name always popular or the new pope francis played the role in popularizing it ? 
  franciszek ( franek ) dolas from `` how i unleashed ww2 '' movies ( the grzegorz brz\u0119czyszczykiewicz one ) is as or even more likely, 
  [ typical polish turist meme ] ( http://i1.ryjbuk.pl/5d4b5a13d39a6d985e52c9902831e3a04412628e/rolming-jpg ), 
  obviously , dr \u00d6sterreich is never wrong, 
   polish government is forced to resign i doubt . 
  as much as i 'm not liking them they got really high ( for polish standards ) support , earlier elections could solidify their possition even further, 
  at least you keep it civil - not more than 10, 
  western europe wtf ? 
  copy paste it into google translator . 
  it 's just lukas with polisz letters : \u0141 = w and sz = sh, 
  hmm why bulgarian flag is upsidedown ? 
  looking at it polish word formation is harder as it 's more random, 
   orban  slavs ... 
   the party that rules still has like 60 % of people 's support ( including me ) . 
  bit over 30 % * ( which is pretty high for polish standards ) http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/ where did you get the 60 % from ? 
   now , i do n't support pis ( rulling party ) , but i honestly hate what the . nowoczesna and it 's daddy po are doing . 
  they are the parties of hypocrisy , and all they do is trying to overthrow the rulling party . 
  from the other side pis just keep giving them ammunition, 
  russian and polish are least related languages in the slavic group . 
  there 's some vocabulary and grammar structures that we recognise easly , but it 's often the case where the commonly used word in one language is very obsure ( eg archaic ) in another . 
  if both speakers got expirience with each others langs you can go by . 
  watching news you only pick up random words . 
  as for sounding i ' v heard from other slavic speakers that polish & russian is a pair that is most easy to tell apart, 
  20-49 % for poland ? 
  lol, 
   edit : bunch of delusional people downvoting me , no chance in talking to the lefties like that . 
  sums up your way of thinking very well, 
  it 's the only argument for po being worse you gave, 
  so president is your only argument ? 
  yes, 
   when po ruled it was even worse situation how so ? 
  ( they are pretty close to my word view and state model ) i voted for them in last elections hoping them to be some breath of normality , they seemed to focus more on governing part and less on pointless screaming , had unprecedented for polish politics focus on merits and legit discussion ; in general looked pretty serious . 
  after elections they have been constantly losing in my eyes - they have not been doing much in terms of legislature , leaders had some dumb comments , they put focus mainly on demonstrations that started to look more like failed pr attempts etc , in tl ; dr they become part of 2 sided camp and polish horrible politics scene, 
   but i keep hearing bad things about the place and do n't understand why cosue bad things happen ? 
  original version of the : - credits song : [ ch\u0142opcy z placu broni - kocham wolno\u015b\u0107 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyminujjyym ) - after credits song : [ tadeusz wo\u017aniak - zegarmistrz \u015awiat\u0142a purpurowy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obvizjrneza ) ( some may recognise it from [ this war of mine trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=balbuyotxqm ) ) - fight scene song : [ stan borys : jask\u00f3\u0142ka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4i4_e7t7ig ), 
  it 's called korepetycje ( korki for shorts ) and they are usually given by either students ( eg . 
  university students often make extra money by teaching school kids ) or teachers . 
  general rule is that you do n't have them with the same teacher you got the subject with . 
  it 's not seen as something bad, 
  the idea is not dumb though, 
  definitly agree it gets way to much credit compared to other soups, 
   europeans in this sub sure do have a lot of faith in the good-intentions of the defense industry . 
  you 're cheering on a machine which , once it gets moving , is unstoppable and rapidly turns public wealth into tons of rusting of steel and bureaucrat salaries . 
  actually it wil be probably much less than we waste now, 
  some tl ; dr what are we looking at aka how is it counted, 
  or barszcz with glorious double letters,

  italy ruins it though, 
  1 . eastern block countries 2 . northen europe / nordics countries 3 . western block countries 4 . iberian countries 5 . southern europe countries ( romania and mayby bulgaria do n't exactly fit that group or italy and romania if you would like to call it balcans ), 
  could n't you just make one gallery post instead of making separate posts ? 
  / edit : also just 2 out of 6 seasons, 
  well duh , that 's obvious, 
  and where is the lie ? 
  we kid of always were as [ mary has title of queen and protectress of poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_madonna_of_cz%c4%99stochowa#coronation_as_queen_and_protectress_of_poland ) since april 1 , 1652, 
  some cities got skm though / edit : skm is szybka kolej miejska ( fast urban train , s-train ) , pretty much a metro , but on ground . 
  it 's a thing in - warsaw , - 3city ( gda\u0144sk + gdynia + sopot + close smaller towns like rumia , reda and wejherowo ) , - silesia ( katowice + surrounding ) and few cities/aglomeriations plan to open their own lines ( like wroc\u0142aw , krak\u00f3w , szczecin , rzesz\u00f3w , bia\u0142ystok , pozna\u0144 or lublin ), 
  my aunt went to us somewhere around the late '70 and she visits us each 7-9 years . 
  she says the she is comes to a new country each time, 
  packages from aunt from chicago is nearly a meme here . 
  now it 's pretty hilarious as those who stayed in my family ended up equal or better off than those who emigrated . 
  we make fun that we should send packages to them , 
  you premis is wrong . 
  chunk of right wing parties labeled as `` eurosceptic '' just for having different idea of how eu is supposed to work, 
  it 's a communist pyramid, 
  you just gave a retarded comment though . 
  it has nothing to do with flair, 
  why should he ? 
  that v4 grave digging competition was weird, 
  lack of physical activity also has its toll . 
  until recently it was super rare to see anyone exercising , not to mention from age groups over 30, 
  ** poland ** - we had huge storms in northen poland , vid : [ five dead as freak storms ravage poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyvj37lyjc ), 
  it 's not a real country so the animal is n't real as well, 
  the borders ar random though,
