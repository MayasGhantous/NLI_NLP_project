  poland not only exists but also has belarus , hurrey i guess, 
  huh i did n't even notice it , slept hard as a rock, 
  twarog with banana/strawberries is the shit, 
  depends on the context . 
  most general would be something close to [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/683px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png ), 
  what about polend ? 
  a potato i guess, 
  from older ones [ interwar poland ] ( http://imgur.com/xqzk199 ) ( rotated 90 ' counterclockwise ), 
  it 's limited to literally to giving only the dates of pearl harbor and nukes, 
  not to mention of entirety of asian theatre, 
  yeah i noticed that mistake after posting , my bad, 
   are some of the stronger teams only teams , 
   sunflower seeds fresh or fried ? 
  they managed to tighten vat income , so that 's nice, 
  huh it 's one of the most popular topping here, 
  damn it 's ugly, 
  more ? 
  do you have anything particular in mind ? 
  only things i see are continuation what has already been started, 
  this gov is not doing much different in the possitive direction ( in terms of growing new industries ) though, 
  that may actually be a good thing for now - thanks to those lower wages we got active job market . 
  it would be really grim if we had as low innovation stats as we got and no corporations to make up for it . 
  sadly cheap labour is our best attribute atm, 
  being anyone in 1938 sucked, 
  you can not deny the region has really bad reputation, 
  it 's couse of the double letters ( sz , cz , rz etc ) . 
  other langs eg czech or lithuanian use single letter with a dash for the same sound, 
  yes , but still - it 's katowice, 
  why the fuck someone marked katowice ? 
  it 's pretty even , depends on the occasion, 
  well duh . 
  the goal of the poll is to show who is 2nd  / edit : i understand vatican , but who and why would vote for uk ? 
  `` free '', 
   but we are one of the few countries in the region that treats its military seriously considering the state of the army - not really, 
  source ? 
  it 's been ike that for around a year, 
  aside from estonia that ruins it, 
  and what exactly is a global city and what are the measured attributes ? 
  / r/travel / r/askeurope or country/city subs, 
  it was either agh or gda\u0144sk polytechnic that has done something like that recently, 
  i blame it on the wet road, 
  it is the temperature at which people start dying, 
  eee what ? 
   and sometimes , i start to think and worry about the future of my beautiful continent . 
  terrorism , populism , unemployment , too slow recovery from the economic crisis ... you mean about your region . 
  we got no terrorism , unemployment stats hit lowest numbers ever , had no economic crisis and populism was always present, 
  could you mayby do a run down on each country/city ? 
  a free day, 
  redditor for 5 years and still does n't know how polish flag looks like ? 
  shame, 
  why only poland has n't changed ? 
  hanse in one picture *, 
  enough for most cities/schools to have a club , but nothing close to football or volleyball in terms of viewer base . 
  i do n't think i ever seen basketball being aired on tv, 
  how are you planning to connect the destinations ? 
  and what are the destinations anyway - countries are very general ? 
  as it looks now you will waste lot of time on moving from one to another, 
  other vids : - [ polish history in 6 minutes : the polish lithuanian union 1385-1795 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhbasgaeeei ) - [ polish history in 6 minutes : women fighting for polish independence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b7shczget0 ) - [ polish history in 6 minutes : poland 's underground state ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lbme-muvfo ), 
  some vids : - [ warsaw now and then ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn5qdaa1ofu ) - [ warsaw now and then part 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9nrhg62zbm ) [ channel with ton of pre-war warsaw footage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc_7uzhh0kcna70a5ubpoohg ) ( some in colour ), 
  whose autocompletes are those ? 
  or another for ball - `` ga\u0142a '' ( more informal ), 
  there 's also few songs by kaczmarski that could count as well eg . 
  : [ rejtan , czyli raport ambasadora ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe6mqxaclyi ) - song about partition sejm or [ list do redakcji prawdy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h0bma2w_n4 ) about political situation during comunism, 
  it 's a bit pointless to post a song without subs . 
  i also search for a song that would cover big chunk of the history, 
  the eu flag made many people butthurt, 
  afaik we do n't have any rap/song . 
  as for fun vid we got [ the animated history of poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2drxgj1nwn8 ) , but from the vid alone it 's hard to learn anything, 
  they could have said he 's belarusian, 
  never looked at it this way though adjective from n\u00f3\u017c is no\u017cowy / a/e / edit : for non-slavic speakers word for knife is `` n\u00f3\u017c '' and `` no\u017cny '' ( adjective from noga = leg ) is similar to adjective from n\u00f3\u017c . 
  in some other slavic lang `` no\u017cny '' may even be the adj from knife/dagger . 
  also dagger is `` sztylet '', 
  they nearly stepped on a mine mentioning ko\u015bciuszko, 
  that 's what eastern ukraine is becoming, 
  couse pictures do not follow what he 's talking about - it 's a gallery of gdansk photos - at 2:05 you got the title `` views of gda\u0144sk '' editing mistake nontheless, 
  holly fuck this vid is annoying, 
  my entry on plc map thread already got -8 for this link  aside from the gdl drama the vid is very well done and fun to watch, 
  similar thing in 3city . 
  corpo companies already got problems with finding workers, 
  recently i ' v read that 10 % of wroc\u0142aw population is ukrainian, 
  everyone knows that jadwiga was married to uncultured barbarian named jogaila who was lithuanian ; ), 
  wow that 's pretty hilarious . 
  nothing close to alexander the best slav material , but still, 
   like modern slavic macedonia ( fyrom ) claiming ancient greek macedonian history . 
  quality comparison, 
   i mean it 's cute that half of the eu countries do n't want to accept refugees , and they do n't wan na take ownership of the conflicts in the european neighborhood , and they want free tax monies from me . 
  3 wrong premises 1 ) do n't want to accept ** forced ** refugees 2 ) we sent humanitarian and stabilisation missions 3 ) free money ? 
  lol . 
  euro funds are more or less a reimbursement/compensation for opening the market to more developed countries ; it 's kind of like western countries buying a right to have privileged status on the market, 
  there are many different groups eg . 
  [ ruthenians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruthenians ) or [ cossacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cossacks ), 
  it does n't say anything about plc though , only about modern history, 
  was already after personal union so it can be counted imo, 
  how so ? 
  yep , a bit earlier - [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozjpz6iask0 ), 
  can you even talk about belarusians or ukrainians in xvii ? 
  i wonder how pierogi got to be the polish thing - there 's nothing special about them , they are not really that popular nor super good and pretty much all nations got them, 
  hmm that actually looks nice / edit as for butchering italian cuisine when i make lasagna i make it more `` mexican '' : standard + red beans , black olives , corn and spice it up with a bit of spicy paprika and chilli, 
  what 's special about it ? 
  wrong costume though olgierd has a costume which is a spin of polish/turkish [ kontusz ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=olgierd+witcher&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiappjumpjuahudkpokhqghatuq_auicigb&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=892#tbm=isch&amp;q=kontusz&amp;imgrc=_ ),
