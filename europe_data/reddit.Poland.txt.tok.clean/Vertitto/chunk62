  it 's hard to read some of them, 
  i 'm not a fan of the contest . 
  i like the concept , but i would love if songs were in nativ langs . 
  i 'm not a fan of the music - big chunk of songs are very generic , bland pop songs , many of which you can instantly say they are eurovision songs my fav polish entry is from 1994 - [ edyta g\u00f3rniak - to nie ja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl5rmmpihp8 ), 
  he 's seen just as hitler - genocidal maniac that invaded our country, 
   in the vast majority of former soviet republics that joined the european union including poland , hungary and the baltic states , gorbachev is perceived far more favorably than stalin . 
  it 's even weird to compare the two here since stalin is seen pretty much just as hitler . 
  i 'm surprised polls got as high as 6 %, 
  i live 5min from where the photo was taken, 
  the challange is quite marketed here , not on country scale , but in corporations , unis and cities . 
  counting gdynia & gda\u0144sk separatley is a bit cheating / edit : gda\u0144sk , gdynia and sopot are essentially one city , it 's called tricity ( tr\u00f3jmiasto ) - saying goes that you live in gdynia , work in gda\u0144sk and party in sopot .

  - they got decent wine - are dirt poor - got rebelious transnistria region - are pretty much romanian - their capital name in polish ( kiszyni\u00f3w ) sounds like some random small village - historically they have been a front in polish-ottoman wars, 
  lol , what authority ? . 
  i 'm able see , hear and think . 
  that 's all what 's necessary to give an opinion, 
  i did n't say they got no western aspirations , but that they are not big . 
  i did n't mention anything about belarusian voting patterns . 
   edit for the kind downvoters : before ukrainian maidan , our armchair experts on all things east of polish border were repeating the mantra that ukraine has no big western aspirations either . 
  by reposting to oblivion ukrainian voting patterns ? 
  belarus , unlike ukraine , does n't have big western aspirations though . 
  i hate the english version, 
  it was something along the lines `` before mods ban me : my grandparants fought for free speach '', 
  that 's relevant as fuck,
