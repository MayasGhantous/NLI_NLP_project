  from expirience living in one of the most turisty places in poland i would say you get used to it all and generally stop paying attention after few months . 
  during the first year i even started to take earlier buses/trains to uni/work just to avoid turists . 
  i remember we had baba yaga or gypsies, 
   1 . i guess there are more supporters here  2 . we are us 's no1 asslicker so ...  3 . i do n't think anyone cares much . 
  for us it 's a small irrevelant coutry on the other side of the globe  5 . 
  us used to be a dream paradise during comunism . 
  now it 's seen as just an ok option ,  6 alien fanatics are not visible here, 
  [ a street from my hometown ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@53.1814966,22.04448,3a,75y,32.44h,83.05t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sdnnt457mgqcbcxpsefytpw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3ddnnt457mgqcbcxpsefytpw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d177.05414%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  usually yes, 
  it need workforce . 
  also generally there were very few belarusians coming to poland , most that emigrated were going to russia instead . 
  the change of direction is a nice change, 
  more of them are emigrating to poland so that 's nice, 
  depends on the country - it 's not a big thing here either, 
  typical work day : ** breakfast ** ( if i have on at all ) ; quark ( twar\u00f3g ) with bananas and a bit of milk ** lunch ** i order something from one of the lunch places around my work ; usually it 's a standard dinner type of meal : potatoes/rice , some meat and veggies ** dinner ** usually if i make something it 's rice/pasta with chicken and some souce ** drinks ** : at work it 's mostly water with ice , generally i drink around 1,5 l of tea daily ( earl grey , black with lemon or some home made juce if i got one ) and some juice/cola at home, 
  it 's more about the model . 
  noone really cares which country the brand originated in, 
  you can look up : - [ polish holidays ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plgteswoqxntemp4zdu3tscqb5d-vw35hi ) - watch some vids presenting the country eg .

  both are ok , but water is more prevelant, 
  compared to czech beer though, 
  try harder , all of those also apply here, 
   but hosts tell their guests they do n't have to take the shoes off , and then the guest decides here an awkward ceremony begins : guest wants to take down the shoes , host says there 's no need , guest insists , host says there 's really no need , seeing the guest still takes his shoes off the hosts offers some slippers to which the guest respods that it 's not worth the hassle , hosts insists ... 
  well it 's not uncommon to hear in poland that we should have sided with germany ( with a pinch of salt ), 
  elementary : english gymnasium : english and german ( could pick from german , french and russian ) highschool : english and german ( could pick from german , french and russian ) uni : english and swedish ( could pick from swedish , german , russian , french and spanish ), 
  if disney songs count then : - [ i wo n't say i 'm in love ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akqjaqgihha ) and pretty much [ all songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qla6mngpies&amp;list=pl4cgmjfajo4k4xqipum-wdv3vzhjumvhd ) from hercules - [ colours of the wind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4udfzegf4rm ) from pocahontas - [ make men out of you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whoo1xf5-pw ) from mulan from normal songs i like [ polish version of malcziki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inxdj-i-yi8 ) much more than the [ yugo original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfi3egxkzh8 ) another would be [ studio accantus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ihbcppglkm ) ' version of [ nightwish 's phantom of the opera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhdgfbe8c_e ), 
  standard name : koszulka na rami\u0105czka informal : \u017conobijka ( wife-beater ), 
  depends on castle . 
  some spots are popular eg . 
  moszna or czocha castle in general castles are more of a reenactment places if anything, 
  i 'm surprised about the amount of people dislikeing it . 
  it 's best refreshing drink i ever had . 
  only issue i got with it is the price - it 's expensive as fuck, 
  for more modern entry i would pick [ kurylewicz 's `` polskie drogi '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyfwa4n0yy8 ), 
  it was n't even close :(, 
   poland  the big bro to look up to in what aspects ? 
   but i do have poland on my `` countries i need to visit someday '' list . 
  seems like an interesting place . 
  when needing to go orthodontist consider going to poland like many swedes/norwgians/germans do and make it a fun trip eg . 
  stena 's party ferry to 3city , make a sight seeing day around gda\u0144sk-sopot , go to your appointment , go party in sopot and have a party ferry back , 
  few brands i recognise upon googling : - [ vera farm ] ( http://www.alleceny.pl/static/images/aleceny_model_product_table/extrabig/acdd59cd4abbd947db529d6cba99ac1d_42d55199d88c3020d9cf877e2774e337.jpeg ) - [ pureplus ] ( http://acor.nazwa.pl/wp/pure/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/my-aloe_products4-2.png ) - [ okf aloe vera king ] ( https://image.ceneo.pl/data/products/10541773/i-okf-aloe-vera-king-napoj-aloesowy-1-5l.jpg ) have not seen an apple + mint variant yet . 
  all of them got floating granules that i would consider large, 
  watching cs 's pgl major atm pretty laid back day in general - started from a bit of fencing sparring with friends and some ice cream later on . 
  watched some matches from world fencing championships leipzig . 
  done some home chores . 
  and we finnally got a nice summer weather in 3city, 
   that 's not enough ? 
  is there a quota to meet ? 
  yes , that 's not enough . 
  the numbers are so small that 's it 's hard to tell if it 's personal way of speaking or national accent . 
   2nd part examples ? 
  / edit : many of my comments here or / r/poland end up being top polish one and very rarely anyone proves or even challanges what i post, 
  and how many of those people speak polish ? 
  very few and even then it 's a ridiculously small sample of both accents and people, 
  hard to find samples of foreigners speaking polish, 
  montenegro , albania and georgia . 
  mayby bulgaria ( hurrey for golden sands ) if it 's not on the list already georgia in recent years started to be pretty popular spot for polish turists . 
  it lacks infrastructure heavily though, 
  there are vineyards in poland, 
  never heard about it . 
  from a-bit-like-beer-but-not-really drinks we got [ kwas chlebowy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvass ) ( kvass/bread acid ), 
  tbh it 's very common to heard such things in poland , especially about germany 's `` turkish ghettos '', 
  and this is way we got low birth rates problem - bears are hard to come by these days, 
  it 's one of [ saint andrew 's day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cznhfquay2k ) games . 
  the tradition is nearly dead though - it 's a festival limited petty much to elementary schools, 
  lol, 
   because she was born there or more importantly - she considered herself to be polish, 
   though the vast majority of the surrounding area 's inhabitants were ukrainians , and the great majority of berdychiv 's residents were jewish , ** almost all the countryside was owned by the polish szlachta ( nobility ) , to which conrad 's family belonged as bearers of the na\u0142\u0119cz coat-of-arms . 
  [ 11 ] polish literature , particularly patriotic literature , was held in high esteem by the area 's polish population . 
  ** i guess it makes it clear, 
   chopin , curie and jp2 or jp2 , walesa and lewandowski, 
  never heard anyone claiming he was polish, 
  we are taught that he was hungarian, 
  in general there are many that are of polish-lithuanian nationality to which poland , lithuania and belarus claim , there 's also many from german speaking minorities , polish jews or polish emigrates some big names examples : - marie sk\u0142odowska-curie - poland & france - frederic chopin - poland & france - adam mickiewicz - poland & lithuania - tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko - poland & belarus - nicolaus copernicus - poland & germany - johannes hevelius - poland & germany, 
  was just driving by on my way to tychy . 
  most of the towns in region seemed really ugly and depressive, 
  or polish, 
  either in polish or as abstracts/pictures, 
  in general cities in gop suck, 
  but then you got the transformation milioners, 
  i do n't think so , why do you ask ? 
  not exactly favourite , but one i tend to get most things from - polish brand [ reserved ] ( http://www.reserved.com/pl/en/ ) , from lpp group ( owner of brands : reserved , cropp , house , mohito , sinsay and tallinder ), 
  - non aggressive religon/culture - hard working - respecting locals the only negative i heard of is smell left from cooking traditional foods . 
  i ' v heard from few people that they will never again rent a room/flat to asian/indian students as the smell is a real pain in the ass to remove, 
  not related to names , but to czech-polish language shenanigans here 's a song [ eva pilarov\u00e1 - padni na kolena ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xhx8r7iefu ) chorus of which in polish means `` get down !, 
  get down on your knees before his dick '' . 
  that would be considered extremally weird, 
  standard ones that most kids go to : - warsaw , couse it 's the capital - krak\u00f3w , couse it 's the old capital + zakopane ( mountains ) + o\u015bwi\u0119cim ( auschwitz ) + wieliczka ( salt mines ) - cz\u0119stochowa , to the [ jasna g\u00f3ra monastery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasna_g%c3%b3ra_monastery ) since it was close : - bia\u0142ystok to the opera/philharmonic - olsztyn to the planetarium - bia\u0142owie\u017ca for \u017cubr and the national park and my school specific : - mielno - at the seaside as summer integration camp for freshmen - ma\u0142e ciche - winter camp in the tatra mountains, 
  not really, 
  something that is allowed that i hate with passion - ** double negatives & questions with negation ** eg . 
  `` i wo n't never go there '' or `` you did n't go there ? '', 
  ( had to use different word order ) they are confusing as fuck and they can be answered with both yes & no and still have the same meaning . 
  another thing is spelling issue - we have letters that sound the same ( u / \u00f3 , ch/h , rz / \u017c ) and you have to memorise which one to use in different words ( there are some rule of thumb rules , but their usefullness is rather weak ) . 
  you spend most of elementary school 's polish lessons on learning that . 
  getting rid of one from each pair would make polish ortography so much easier . 
  words would looks really weird , but after 2-3 generations people would get used to that . 
  it 's just a cool looking symbol , that 's it . 
  i could bet 90 % of people do n't even know what it means, 
  i never could do the `` put our lips and tongue in x position '' instructions,
