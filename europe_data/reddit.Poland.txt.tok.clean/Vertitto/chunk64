  hmm from vids it sounds pretty much like polish y, 
  when it comes to english speakers - pretty much all of our special letters ( \u0105 , \u0119 , \u017c / rz , \u017a , \u015b , \u0107 , \u0142 , \u0144 , d\u017c , d\u017a , sz , cz ) for other slavic speakers i guess sz/cz or \u015b / \u0107 combos , mayby \u0105 and \u0119 ( looking slavs to comment about it ), 
  so far i noticed that it 's the dumb questions that downvoted eg . 
  do you also eat food in europe ? 
  they do not translate to english at all movies : [ kiler i ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127626/ ) & [ ii ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190506/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) and [ ch\u0142opaki nie p\u0142acz\u0105 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238119/ ) are probably the biggest quote mines, 
  if you searched a bit harder you could find something in bigger cities . 
  oh god - no books or tv and those forced kids group events . 
  it was painful, 
  3city : tourists , especially organised kids groups it also sucks that most buildings that are at the main street of sopot look like shit,

   jelly ... with meat ? 
  wow . 
  [ vid ] ( https://youtu.be/tch8sd1z17k?t=6m2s ), 
  lots of it : - [ golonka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eisbein ) - borsch , anything from beetroot really - [ kapu\u015bniak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabbage_soup ) - [ bigos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bigos ) - not a fan of poppy seed strudels - tomato soup - [ flaki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tripe_soups ) - liver with onions - [ fasolka po breto\u0144sku ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baked_beans#/media/file:00956_polish_baked_beans_-_a_la_bretonne_-.png ) - [ kaszanka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaszanka ) - [ jelly with meat ] ( http://www.mojegotowanie.pl/media/cache/default_view/uploads/media/default/0001/13/3a95a0fb9896528009412f02f989045580fdf92a.jpeg ) to name a few, 
   it 's a big deal for some reason everybody is concerned about the essay topic on the polish exam and bitch about how much they are downgrading maths exam level with each year, 
  another sdong about loving ireland : [ t.love - ajrisz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vpefc_6kig ) more : - [ jacek kaczmarski - `` limeryki o narodach '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiaooimj8k ) - about grievances beween nations - [ jacek kaczmarski - reporta\u017c bo\u015bnia ii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6y2jtriqsy ) - about yugo wars, 
  first of all what are you looking for ? 
  prospects are pretty ok here , nothing super optimistic , but good . 
  as long as corporations do n't make another big move eastwards we are ok, 
  all of that [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal ), 
  is n't norway in pretty much all eurostat stats ? 
  2 ) he 's nearly a national hero 4 ) depends on the details , constitution bans some of them :  * article 13 *  * political parties and other organizations whose programmes are based upon totalitarian methods and the modes of activity of nazism , fascism and communism , as well as those whose programmes or activities sanction racial or national hatred , the application of violence for the purpose of obtaining power or to influence the state policy , or provide for the secrecy of their own structure or membership , shall be prohibited . 
  * in general like all over europe socialdemocrats in one form or another raign supreme . 
  some subsidies ( like free education ) are untauchable . 
   is the cold war seen as a mistake on the part of your country ? 
  general feeling is that we were betrayed by the west , that we should have been placed on the other side of the fence . 
   is america framed as the bad guy at all in that time period ? 
  mayby a bit in politics , but it was seen as a paradise that everyone wanted to emigrate to, 
  well duh , it got blown up, 
  by normal talking , having hobby , drinking , doing things in general, 
  ac is a thing only in some offices and hotels . 
  nearly noone has them at home, 
  depends what they negotiate and how the `` leaving eu '' part looks like ( aside from the eu there 's dozens of funds , organisations that country can be in that people often just called eu ) , i do n't think there 's a procedure for that . 
  1 ) like a tv static due to sz , cz , \u015b , \u0107 , \u017c , \u017a sounds 2 ) pretty much [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt4dfa4foey ), 
  neat post history, 
  non of them do . 
  which one sounds russian to you ? 
  kaczmarski just uses few russian words, 
  the big two are hitler and stalin, 
  first three that come to my mind : - [ pudelsi - wolnosc slowa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr99pykbn1o ) - rundown of polish politics bullshittery from around the 2000s - [ maciej male\u0144czuk - fajnie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrgcruticuw ) - updated version for current political enviroment - [ jacek kaczmarski - `` list do redakcji prawdy '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h0bma2w_n4 ) - about communism era , song is russian raport of polish politics ( i ' v even done translation of this song on reddit , but can not find the post ), 
  i had very good teacher in gymnasium/highschool , additionally i had extra lessons in a language school ( i made cae cert back in highschool via it ) and most importantly i used english on daily basis via online games , music and movies . 
  my speaking has always been a problem - i rarely used spoken english and i got really heavy polish accent my english fluency dropped later on - i learnt more casual and finance vocab , but my spelling , grammar or fancy vocab went to shit, 
  yes , we still got them, 
   twitter i got impression it 's used mainly by celebrities , politicians or companies . 
  as for subject importance ( or prestige ) i guess it 's 1 . maths 2 . chemistry/biology 3 . foreign lang ( english or german ) and the rest with physics being very high up there, 
  yes . 
  complaining of how shitty the country is is a standard drinking topic ( or even `` how 's the weather '' type standard topic tbh - even here or on / r/europe you will see poles complaining at each `` poland did something well '' thread ) . 
  where i work we got some ukrainians/belarussians working with us who so far got `` poland so cool , such developed , such quality '' attitude . 
  it 's super awkward for them to listen our complaining of how shitty poland is, 
  1 ) mostly in relation to ww2 2 ) atomic bombs and pearl harbour are only things mentioned from the pacific . 
  and it 's literally 2-3 sentences or even just dates, 
  they still got more power than smaller countries like croatia , portugal or even poland, 
  not directly , but indirectly it has big say who joins, 
  it 's nearly a dead martial art, 
  some drone vids : - [ poland is beautiful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbu_frg8vuu&amp;t=46s ) - [ holiday in poland | 4k ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekz6i58kvpi ), 
  us would n't let it happen, 
  song about ukraine - [ hej soko\u0142y !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hej+sokoly ) ( = hey falkons ! ), 
  and if shanties count then - [ hiszpa\u0144skie dziewczyny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rdg6guv-wq ) ( = spanish girls ) , [ morskie opowie\u015bci ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09h6fmmk1lu ) ( = sea stories ) or [ gdzie ta keja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwliymmdyuu ) ( = where 's that quay ), 
  estonia is the little kitten of countries on the internet, 
  excuse my latin, 
  decent transliteration yes , this is where the beer is from . 
  germany would be most reasonable option . 
  language would be a big problem though . 
  most fun option would probably be with ireland . 
  anyway that 's irrevelant couse noone really would like to be our buddy ( well mayby aside from hungary and georgia ), 
  or since you call us pszeki ( or smth like that ) here 's a town to reassure that 's a correct description of how we sound - przasnysz ; ^ ), 
  never seen anyone using them . 
  on the other hand only time i visit mc is while going back home from drinking and having no kebab around , not exactly the rush hour , 
   also , there is no such thing as `` identity europa '' . 
  says the guy with eu flair , 
  it was brought up by po couple of times, 
   whoever would even suggest something like this would commit political suicide depends on what aspects . 
  when it comes to hospitals i do n't think people would have strong feelings either way as to get something done you need to pay anyway . 
  it was proposed few times and i do n't remember any big uproar aside from worker unions, 
  you are slavic speaker so it does n't count , 
  what do you mean ? 
  for the contest i put my hometown - \u0141om\u017ca, 
  i do n't count people pronouncing the names using the versions they got in their lang  katowice katovis , katowiche , katoviche , ketovicz . 
  often foreigners try to add random polish soundng letters native english speakers are worst from my expirience . 
  you can check how to pronounce them by copy-pasting them into google transaltor and make it read in polish, 
  the biggest ones i guess are wroc\u0142aw and katowice , i would expect those names to be fairly easy for foreigners ( oppose to eg . 
  szczecin or \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ) , but i can not count number of ways people came up with to pronouce them, 
  few trends i ' v noticed : - people drink more responsibly - drunk driving is not longer socially acceptable - they drink less and more varied alcohols - it was vodka or some home stuff , now many people opt for beer , wine or whiskey - people are less eager to fight - it was a standard to have at least one fight during the wedding , now it 's very rare, 
  not really . 
  worst part of eu are still quite up there making the region as a whole very nice place to live in, 
  quality of life mayby, 
  in school you learn at least 2 languages in most schools you start with english ( in some it 's german ) and later you pick 2nd one , usually from : english ( if you had german previously ) / german / russian / french / spanish . 
  i ' v heard in bigger cities some schools got chinese , but it 's still a novelty . 
  specialised classes ( eg . 
  medical or law profiles ) may additionally teach latin in my school we had english as 1st and we could chose from german , russian and french later on . 
  people more or less distributed in 60 % german , 25 % russian and 15 % french ratio, 
  depends in how many ways you would like to divide europe i guess, 
  same as english - wikipedia , but it 's pronounced differently [ google translate text to speech ] ( https://translate.google.pl/?hl=pl#pl/en/wikipedia ) ( that accent is super weird though ) - it 's like vikipedia , but with normal e instead of english e, 
  i 'm stereotypical white dude when it comes to spicy things black pepper is pretty spicy chilli peppers are uneatably hot , one small chunk ( black pepper seed small ) is enough to make a big family pot of soup spicy, 
  why eastern europe ? 
  if anywhere they would leave the continent - for eg . 
  canada , us , nz , austraila etc, 
   usa is seen as less racially progressive than we , but only slightly less . 
  mayby by americans,
