  bad luck i guess, 
  heavy enough to instantly tell he 's not polish could n't say where 's he 's from though, 
  it 's not like we got ton to chose from ... anyway eastern women ( belarussian/russian/ukrainian ) speaking polish just melts polishmen hearts, 
  volleyball, 
  oh you, 
  ogorkowa without sour cream ? 
  heretic !, 
  the on one the picture looks so wrong - whole cucumbers , no sourcream ... [ better photo ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3uxhzwotyiu/uz9nrzjjcui/aaaaaaaabcm/sogqkboanse/s1600/zupa-og%c3%b3rkowa.jpg ) or [ this one ] ( http://umniewkuchni.blox.pl/resource/dsc02064.jpg ) also it 's best on 2nd day, 
  it 's a bit hard to compare as i guess different regions make the soups differently ( in regards to all soups : fuck dill and parsley ) 1 . 
  [ broth with noodles ] ( http://smakujmy.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rosol_gotowe1.jpg ) 4 . 
  [ broccoli cream soup ] ( http://plcdn.ar-cdn.com/recipes/xlarge/d6cfe180-d2b7-4118-a0e7-d646e1c6db74.jpg ) ( the spicy one ), 
  no worries those who liberated you either stayed in western europe or ended up in syberia , 
  i never put time to research this ( it sits in my conspiracy bullshit box for now ) , but i ' v heard multiple times that supposedly there were plans of poland & france invading germany in the interwar, 
  - economic : centrist - diplomatic : peaceful - civil : moderate - social : progressive - closest match : liberalism [ link ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=54.3&amp;d=63.3&amp;g=53.8&amp;s=68.2 ) many of the questions were really weird - they seem to put various unrelated aspects as if they were in opposition of eachother, 
  iksi\u0144ski ( x-inski ) in terms of normal surname : nowak or kowalski, 
  the name itself is ok i guess . 
  i got problem with adjective/people group - polish , it sounds off to me . 
  in general i do n't like forms that got another , casual meaning or are very close to it . 
  it 's same in polish, 
  empty in a sense not urbanised - very few cities, 
  any period/aspect in particular ? 
  generally norman davis ' [ god 's playground ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/god%27s_playground ) is considered to best english book on polish history . 
  [ short interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oosdneblxw ) with the author, 
   i 'd love to know more about the polish situation with all those borders going everywhere . 
  what 's the gist of it ? 
  tl ; dr : stable border with german states , mountains at south , ally with lithuania and weak small states in vaccum left by mongols , empty land in the east - huge expansion eastwards . 
  then absolute monarchies , to many wars at once for too long etc lead to vanishing from maps . 
  then ww1 and recreation and beef with lithuania and soviets , then ww2 and stalin and here we are now, 
  actually it 's closest it ever been [ map ] ( http://dzieje.pl/sites/default/files/imagecache/infografika/infografiki/chrzest_mieszko.png ) - borders from the first years of polish `` state '' ; [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavvwluywo0 ) with border changes, 
   in the united states , students tend to hold a very negative outlook on education could you expand on it ? 
  here big chunk of things you learn at highschool/uni are considered useless . 
  for many people it 's just about getting masters or higher , many do n't care at all about the content of the degree, 
  but if russia is kill , what new purpuse in life ? 
  why not kill polan instead ? 
  it 's a standard ( we even got neighbourhood contests for best looking balcony ) , but not to a degree shown on the pictures you can put stuff on it , but i do n't think there 's much you can do in terms of rebuilding it . 
  to put simply you can put flowers , sunbeds , tables , shaders etc , but you can not build a baroque portal . 
  never even thought v4 to be a thing you could identify with, 
  i do n't get your question - it is poland 's flag, 
  it 's already an official thing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_poland#right_and_obligation_to_fly_the_flag, 
  yea but there 's quite many countries , regions , towns that got nearly the same flag ( upper austria , tyrol , indonesia , monako , salzburg , vorarlberg , bohemia to name a few ), 
  it 's simple and looks nice , especially during national holidays where it weaves from buildings and lampposts . 
  on the other hand the design and colours are very popular over the world making it pretty generic . 
  if i had to change it , mayby [ royal polish-lithuanian ] ( https://m.io.ua/img_aa/medium/1460/91/14609131.jpg ) flag idea would be ok : red-white-red with pointy ends and ornamented coa in the center left ( like spanish one ), 
   inteligent , but hateful and delusional . 
   in some way i admire how he managed to grow such cult following  ( for non poles - i 'm talking about kaczy\u0144ski , leader of rulling party , by law just standard mp ) https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/693neh/what_do_you_really_think_of_your_countrys_leader/, 
  i find this question really weird - how else people could get this type of stuff ? 
  you could as well asked if we got stores that sell food . 
  at my work 30min as part of 8h work day ( depends on tasks at hand though ), 
  not an arab country though, 
  this 2 have been my fav songs for around 1 year : [ anna czartoryska - grande valse brillante ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-nla9arsc4 ) and [ marek grechuta - motorek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8hsgq2h8jg ) and special mention for [ jacek kaczmarski - \u015aniadanie z bogiem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el7nz28ylpo ) and [ \u017bywio\u0142ak - \u015awidryga i midryga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihmp6eo05jk ), 
  for foreigners : it 's pretty much the costumes they have in turkish series muhte\u015fem y\u00fczy\u0131l ( women clothes are a bit different though ), 
  it 's pointless and annoying, 
  3city , finances/accounting my department : 1x hungarian , 1x belarussian , 1x ukrainian , 1x irish and ~ 20x polish, 
  for slavic countries : [ lech , czech and rus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lech,_czech,_and_rus ) - lech - poland - czech - czech - rus - eastern slav countires aka belarus , ukraine and russia from historical ones it would be : - [ mieszko i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mieszko_i_of_poland ) - christianised poland , considered first ruler of poland - [ boles\u0142aw i the brave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boles%c5%82aw_i_the_brave ) - his son , first king of poland, 
  that is dying off really fast though, 
  corporate finance/accounting : around ~ 2,500 pln ( ~ 593 eur / 648 usd ) which is okeish . 
  you will get more in warsaw though / edit : ofc nett, 
  ski jumping , football and volleyball personally i 'm interested only in fencing . 
  from time to time i will glance at other martial arts like judo , wrestling or taekwondo, 
  it 's not a place known for the opposite either though, 
   is gone in europe western europe *, 
  it 's a standard, 
  tango was pretty popular in the interwar - [ playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nqqfka8liw&amp;list=plaf7e954ed1205349 ) with polish interwar songs, 
  [ list i made for similar thread while back ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4h1r9j/what_books_did_you_read_in_secondary_school/d2ngxh4/ ), 
  i do n't like it , it sounds fake and forced imo taking the name from a neighbouring language that has short version would be much better eg . 
  what 's weirder is that it uses polish letters that do n't exist in other lanuages - `` cz '' and `` ch '' instead of english version of them : `` ch '' and `` h '' respectively, 
  unless you would like to have border with polan ; ), 
  it was pretty normal in around '90 - '20, 
  we also do it, 
  [ playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1qaslb3820&amp;list=pluplbi_fow89b08jncy4uojryk2t8sjdp ) with weather forcasters, 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  our religion lessons are pretty much `` jesus loves us '' nonsense . 
  as for bible study , philosophy etc we do that on polish ( aka literature ) lessons, 
   they are not obligatory just in theory though . 
  in practise often there 's no other option . 
  on the other hand it 's not treated as a serious subject . 
  in many schools it 's pretty much a free lesson , kind of `` if you want to listen just sit in the first few desks . 
  if not - just do your thing , just be quiet '' . 
  in my school it meant we all studied for other lessons , done homework or just chatted with friends . 
  most was a truck going by the nearby road, 
  and double/triple letters : sz , cz , rz , ch , dz , d\u017c , d\u017a , dzi, 
  here it 's not even an element taken into consideration when applying for uni - it 's only matura exams points + science contests, 
  we do n't really have lunch in school aside from early elementary school . 
  we got 5min breaks between lessons and one 15min one . 
  they are used for either doing your homework or hanging out with friends, 
  school is for learning . 
  you got additional activities after school, 
  kebab if it counts, 
  also what 's the point of such club ? 
  if you wants to do something with religion , you go the the specific religion 's place ( eg . 
  church ), 
  religious clubs . 
  also as theeatinggames mentioned - there 's no need for one when eveyone is either catholic or atheist, 
  never heard of such thing in my highschool there were sport clubs ( football , volleyball , bridge , hiking etc ) and various subject ones eg . 
  math , physics , acting etc, 
  i service international clients , so day in lieu, 
  best way - a lil ot couse best way to celebrate the work day is to work, 
  2016 : boys : - antoni - jakub - szymon - jan - filip girls : - zuzanna - julia - lena - maja - hanna [ source ] ( https://mc.gov.pl/aktualnosci/najpopularniejsze-imiona-2016-roku-to-zuzanna-i-antoni ), 
  in regards to what ? 
  do n't russians think that civilisation ends with urals ?
