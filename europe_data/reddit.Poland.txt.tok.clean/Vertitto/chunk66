  indeed, 
  general rule of thumb : the more south you go the more people talk, 
  usually they do n't . 
  the big separator is during/after communism mayby joining the eu could serve for such point ( 2004 ) another one could be [ smole\u0144sk plane crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) ( 2010 ),

  i get most of my clothes from [ reserved ] ( http://www.reserved.com/pl/pl/ ) ( polish [ lpp group ] ( http://www.lppsa.com/brands?lang=en ) ) or [ lancerto ] ( https://www.lancerto.com/ ) ( also polish company ), 
  most kids got blonde hair , but they darken with age . 
  both are common enough not be anything special . 
  `` white '' blond is pretty rare though, 
  pretty much the same thing here with our nfz, 
  and how are they supposed to kill us ? 
  lol, 
  i do n't see them adding anything positive to a person . 
  more often than not they give a negative touch , especially the generic ones, 
  [ news segment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=humuibawihs ), 
  that 's why i understand some things, 
  i listened it more for curiosity of how much i could understand not knowing either belarusian or russian . 
  it 's not much , but it 's always fun expirience . 
  the station itself is polish funded project to promote belarusian culture ( mostly via language as russian is the dominating lang there ) and regime free news . 
  kind of radio version of bielsat, 
  i grew up pretty close to the border , listened to belarusian radio and now got 2 belarussian coworkers, 
  sour cream for fruit ones, 
  in polish direct transaltion is fatherland ( ojczyzna ) , but it has femine form , so a mid point i guess, 
  pretty much nothing - there was some civ in ancient times ( literally this , no details ) - alexander the great 's conquests stopped at india - spices trades as context for looking for another route - colonilism - that brits had it and that 's it, 
  there are some rules , but in the same time as many exceptions . 
  for the most part you just need to know . 
  in general surname changes form based on singular-plural form ( eg . 
  family : kowalscy , dude : kowalski ) , based on sex ( eg . 
  m - jankowski , f - jankowska ) and based on martial status for women ( eg . 
  standard : nowak , married : nowakowa , nor-married : nowak\u00f3wna ) - martial status is dying out though , you can still hear it used from time to time most common , typical for polish surnames ending : - ( plural , m , f ) : - scy / - ski / - ska wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_name, 
  calling it a metro is the easiest way to describe its role in 3city to a foreigner, 
  magic of polish grammar . 
  some surnames just got their own rules, 
  in short : male : jan kowalski or jan nowak female : anna kowalska or anna nowak,

  a bit with lithuanians , with ukrainians less . 
  we are neighbours after all , it 's not like there 's a clear cut cultural border . 
  ukrainians got similar language , but similarlly to belarus they are much closer to russia culturally , soviet mentality is still pretty strong there . 
  lithuania on the other hand has completley different language , but they got long history with us and due to being in catholic europe circle is much closer to us culturally - this is why baltics often also get counted to central europe,

  to much missed/outdated steorotypes i guess  poland is significantly poorer than western europe countries that does n't mean that there 's poverty - we are around eu average when it comes to [ poverty stats ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion )  the culture is similar to russian culture ( ** men squat ** and what not ) it 's not really a thing here do you actually know anything about polish or russian culture ? 
  poverty and culture ? 
  aside from cold war why is that ? 
  it 's not / edit : we got annual international festival of roma music & culture that takes place somewhere in summer though [ fragment from last year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdtq07ugs7g ),

  it 's a bad time to post it as spring has not started yet . 
  i 'm in neighbourhood surrounded by forrest . 
  [ photo ] ( http://imgur.com/a/at3yl ) from my balcony from last summer, 
   whose citizens typically tirelessly argue they are not eastern , but central europe ( poland and czechia ) citizens of said countries argue that they are not eastern european , not that they were n't, 
  context, 
   dear easter european friends , ** the ex warsaw pact countries ** have experienced an incredible growth since the fall of the berlin wall . 
   can you tell me anything that improved in your life over the years ? 
  literally everything from infrastructure , through services to social interactions . 
  i mean during the communism people were amazed how cool perol stations there are , that they got a thing called microweave ovens and if you had family abroad or knew some smugglers it was insane to get package with western stuff . 
  today average standard of living is not that different from old western block countries , some of which we already overtook  o you recall something that made you understand that things were going better ? 
  biggest moment was when during one family dinner we were comparing where my father 's old school friends ended up in life . 
  pretty much everyone who stayed in poland were in better place than those who emigrated to us , especially those who started their own business during transformation it 's also pretty fun to see reactions of my aunt who emigrated to us in around '80 each time she visits us ( each ~ 7-8 years ) . 
  each time she visited poland was a completley different country another was when we hired group of guys who previously were working in greece for over 15 years and got to listen how fucked up greece is,

  i would say [ sami swoi ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062228/ ) trilogy , but i guess it 's completely out of reach for non-natives, 
  - [ hej sokoly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlc806bszxs ) or [ sz\u0142a dzieweczka do laseczka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvrl9l3pjj8 ) - rock hits like eg .

  they are always sung at sport event breakes eg . 
  in general we got ton of rock songs ( mostly ballads ) from late ' 80 / ' 90/early '00 that got cult status . 
  when they are played on radio in public places eg . 
  [ hiszpa\u0144skie dziewczyny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rdg6guv-wq ) , [ morskie opowiesci ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09h6fmmk1lu ) , [ 24 lutego bijatyka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ktefrmx73g ) - sung poetry songs like [ celina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9i0pw4j3xq ) , [ baranek ] ( https://youtu.be/x_p1a0ytcyq?t=1m13s ) we do n't really have tradition of singing in pubs . 
  songs are most often sung duing sport events , summer events or at camp fires, 
   ordnung it 's a goal for most people , we constantly put ourselves vs germans in `` it should be like there '' fashion , we constantly complain about regulations , but if a slightest thing is off we cry why it 's not reguleted and why noone is supervising it ; trips to south or got forbit to middle-east/asia are heart attack inducing expirience for many people etc it 's funny to complain or to compare ourselves to germans , but comparing to rest of europe or world we are pretty high up there, 
  something like train going next to a building , but more, 
  or schizophrenic :p,
