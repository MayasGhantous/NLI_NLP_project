  transition region , 
  yes , in simplified terms we are [ in the northen europe culture zone ] ( https://youtu.be/wdqayc1sr7g?t=44s ) beer/vodka vs wine potatoes vs pasta butter vs olive oil ordnung vs mess toned down vs loud coconut vs peach culture etc  is n't poland catholic ? 
  so are philippines or mexico, 
  mediterranean ones / edit : seeing o-soto-gari 's post i take that back - gypsy/roma culture it is . 
  did n't think they count, 
  something like `` chujnia z grzybni\u0105 '', 
  i always liked the sound of `` do kurwy n\u0119dzy '' ( lit . 
  for whore 's misery ; [ spoken ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xonspuirjhc ) ) , works like english `` for fuck 's sake '' , but more aggresive, 
  couse newly elected king - [ sigismund iii vasa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund_iii_vasa ) was also king of sweden and wanded the capital to be in more central location ( and closer to sweden ) . 
  [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/rzeczpospolita_1600.png ) with major cities of that time for some context kings would still be coronated in krak\u00f3w , but whole royal court and administration was moved to warsaw, 
  it also has a palace that can work as presidential palace . 
  btw . 
  jeziorko is the capital of disco polo, 
  it was the capital for half of poland 's existance , cultural capital, 
  like i mentioned pretty much all overseas territiries got - some are in the eu , some not , each has very specified relation with the union . 
  it 's reversed though - they are part of the country that belongs to the eu , but act as if they do n't or only parially . 
  [ cgp grey part about it ] ( https://youtu.be/o37yjbfrrfg?t=3m38s ), 
  catholic church backs science on that , but there are some fringe wackos, 
  which one : the official soviet-like one or the white-red-white ? 
  europe : spain world : iran or kazahstan, 
  it does n't exist here, 
   well , that 's an impossibility because they 're not separate countries there 's ton of regions that got special treatement eg . 
  overseas territories . 
  scotland can get similar treatment - ton of exceptions, 
   suppression of religion by a foreign regime will do that to a country . 
  not really , all our neighbours are proof to the contrary , we are the odd one . 
  the difference here is that church was heavily involved in opposition to the regime, 
  we are still close to church, 
  confirm , `` rumun '' ( aka romanian ) is often used as a slur . 
  many people are not awere of difference between roma and romanians . 
  it 's used as another word for `` cygan '', 
  expected to see bulgaria marked , 
   where does that friendship come from ? 
  i have n't heard of it before . 
  wiki goes over history of it . 
  in a tl ; dr it 's a history of common enemies , shared kings , granting each other asylum when needed etc atm i feel it 's mostly reinforced by the rhyme , as you learn it as a kid , which creates a possitive steorotype . 
  poland and hungary probably is there any other group of countries thet got [ friendship is magic rhyme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) that is taught since kindergarten age and mutual friendship day ? 
  czech & slovaks are right after, 
  poland is not one of those countries though, 
  it would be hilarious if they announced 2 speed eu and poland gets to be in the `` better '' half if we adopt euro, 
  how will it count when may triggers a50 , but scotland and/or n.ireland get to stay in eu via some series of * ? 
  also from 2nd camp - tusk has been rulling the 2nd party for quite some time , was rulling poland for 8years and once he got offered presidency in the eu , he `` dropped everything '' and took the job . 
  it left a bad taste for many people thread about that on / r/poland : [ why are polish people dislike donald tusk ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/5r11h8/why_are_polish_people_dislike_donald_tusk/ ), 
  not exactly , but close, 
  polish politics are almost like american ones in a sense we are close to 2 party system and heavily polarised society . 
  current rulling party is abysmally anti-tusk , their leader believes tusk killed his brother , the former president via `` planned '' [ plane crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash )  but is this level of anti-eu hate a common thing in poland ? 
  not really , we are always in the top pro eu countries in all polls, 
  nope, 
  [ full movie on yt with subs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmqqpey96r4 ) i warn it 's a very depressing movie, 
  i do n't think there 's a landmark that i would call european at first thought . 
  they are always nation specific first, 
  in what way ? 
  normal dinner ? 
  take away/fastfood ? 
  various pasta/chicken + rice dishes are for student dinner kebab is no1 drinking fastfood and pizza/burger are standard fastfoods and zapiekanka is no1 fastfood in turist places normal family dinner is traditionally polish - pork chops ( wiener schnitzel ) + sauerkraut + potatoes or some soup, 
  those are so random and small that you wo n't be able to recognise if it 's just the speaker 's quirk or location, 
  - public finances or to be exact - pension system crash is pending - political split - it used to be bad already , but now it 's getting even worse , soon we may just have 2 party system like us - education/entrepreneurship - our system is outdated and new technologies are not springing up . 
  being a cheap labourforce hub a small companies migration to cheaper region may wreck our job market, 
  just copy paste it into google transaltor, 
  or more comonnly know as kapusta kiszona, 
  it 's standard - accents/dialects are pretty much dead in poland ( with few exceptions ), 
  more they vs we rethoric , more trade wars , more military muscle showing with soft threats, 
  up till around 2008 it seemed we could fix the relations just as we fixed with germany ( or at least make it normal ) , but then georgian conflict happend , and plane crash , and ukraine ... for now it seems it will get worse with time, 
  [ come with us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdreh4le7x0 ), 
  anyway what would be the top sports ? 
  from french sport accomplishments i only know that that france has been a huge powerhouse in my discipline ( fencing ) since forever, 
  you can get 0,5 pln for returnable beer bottles . 
  ( deposit ) aside from that nothing, 
  is judo a popular thing or is he just charismatic ? 
  i guess that the disconnection between spelling and pronunciation is an obstacle for most foreigners, 
  requirement is at least 1/3 time, 
  i 'm fucked up and fence 6 days a week  classes start right after my working hours so it blends perfectly into my daily schedule, 
  i do fencing from 9:30 to 11:45 ( i take 1 and give 1 individual lesson + standard class ) generally people play either football , gym , running or swimming . 
  most people just go shopping/clean their homes or simply do nothing, 
  it 's exactly the same with sub-par democracies, 
  i 'm from city quite close to the border and know few belarusians, 
  opposed to oligarchs in other variants ? 
  imo there 's no difference . 
  people itt react as if other mentioned countries had funcionating democracy, 
  so what if life quality is pretty ok, 
  it is, 
  it 's good life in a light dictatorship vs crappy life in crappy democratic country, 
  would you really like to live in a shitty country just becouse of a principle ? 
  and why is that ? 
  belarus is richer , safer and more stable than pretty much each of those, 
  there are countries like kosovo , moldova , ukraine , macedonia or bosnia . 
  belarus is far above each of those, 
  why is that ? 
  from curiosity what name would you pick then ? 
  daily , but only becouse few black guys work in my office generally you could see few black people from time to time , mostly turists during the summer season, 
  higher education is free ( aka gov pays ) you need to pay if : - you go to a private uni ( which usually means you were to bad to get to public one ) - you want to study `` zaocznie '' , which means that lectures take place during the weekends , it 's aimed at working people, 
  and similar thing with swedish throne in a combo win situation we may have had polish-lithuanian-moscovite-swedish commonwealth, 
   i 'm hoping the prevalence of sparkling water is a thing beyond poland and germany !, 
  what ? 
  by default water is normal water not sparkling, 
  to make us feel comfortable ? 
  - just do n't approach . 
  dunno if it 's true for all countries , but i got a feeling most nations are of `` leave me alone , i will say when i need something '' kind - first intention comes from the customer , not from the seller . 
  or if you have to just give the info and do n't nag people - a `` no '' is a `` no '' .
