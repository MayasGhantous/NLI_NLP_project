  people often get uncomfortable or weird out by american-style service , the asian/middle eastern type of selling is just scarry that 's a bit shitty advise i guess . 
  anyway why would you want to approach people ? 
  never heard about it being a thing nor expirienced it, 
  you may find some nba fans , but that would be it . 
  it 's not a thing you could talk about with random people, 
   people speak about american movies , books , tv series , ** sport ** and music all the time about american sport ? 
  never heard about it, 
  3 that i got foundest memories : - rick and morty - futurama - star gate series  side question : what do you think about your representation in the american media ? 
  there 's not much - they always butcher the language though . 
  instead of looking up how it sounds or how grammar works they often end up with google translate quality and pronounce it with steorotypical russian or american-polish accent like in latest polish scene i 'm aware of - [ poland scene from x-men apocalypse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afonbkbn6nm ) . 
  i would say it 's literature , language and maths . 
  math is considered to be the main denominator that shows how good you are, 
  never heard of it, 
  [ homo sovieticus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homo_sovieticus ) is one of the prominent things, 
  thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4k868r/what_is_higher_education_university_like_in_europe/ poland : there 's no such thing as collage here , there are few types of higher education schools : - university ( eg . 
  philosophy , law , administration , linguistic , philology , economic , finances , math , statistics , chemistry , biology , physics etc ) - politechnics ( tech unis , hard sciences , various kinds of engineering ) - medical unis - art/music academy - physical education academy - various officers academies ( eg . 
  police , army , navey , civil marine , civil flights etc ) in general the system is - for most : bachelor ( licencjat ; 3year ) + masters ( magister ; 2year ) + optional special curses eg . 
  2-4 years to get specialisation in law ( aplikacja ; eg . 
  for being a judge or notary ) - technical : engineer ( in\u017cynier , 3,5 year ) + masters ( magister ; 2year ) - medical : medical degree ( equivalent to masters , 6 years ) + 5/6years of specialisation ( combined with practise ) some curses do n't have split between bachelors and masters , you just have to go straight up for masters . 
  in general : - free - public   private - you enroll based on [ matural ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matura ) results ------------------------------------------------------------ school system in general : - elementary 6y - junior high school 3y - highschool 3y ( or 4 if it 's [ technikum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technikum_%28polish_education%29 ) ; you go to these if you plan to go to some uni ) or vocational school ( if you want to be eg . 
  a welder ) - higher mentioned above, 
  i could bet over 95 % of people here have not even heard about sikhs, 
  normal would be just like schwertritter wrote - kowne\u0144ski, 
  [ polish politics rundown ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/5ot3yr/polish_politics_rundown/ ) thread from / r/poland, 
   please note that there 's an `` i '' in the name do you perhaps know where does the weird irregularity come from ? 
  it sounds horribly off, 
  heh we are the destination , 
  gdp is irrevelant  should be no match for the nato forces as long as nato responds  what is more , their military centers are all concentrated in the west part of the country . 
  right at our freaking border russia it not a concern for countries like france , spain or italy , but it is for baltics or to lesser extent poland . 
  had they wanted they could have rolled over us few times before nato even decided on anything . 
  and at this - there 's an option that nato could simply ditch us as other countries may not want to go to war, 
  we share one with belarus : [ bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bia%c5%82owie%c5%bca_forest ), 
  its revival started thanks to russian embargo on polish apples - there were [ `` eat polish apples to anger putin '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-28590589 ) campaigns and cider was part of that . 
  since then cider became quite popular we got apple and pear ( less popular ) ciders . 
  i got no idea why or how you connected the two, 
  i do n't think i ever seen anyone 20 + using them . 
  and even then it 's considered to be hipster gimmick for people who want to smoke , but do n't know how to, 
  18 + but that does n't mean teens are not smoking, 
  it 's a thing mostly among gymnasium-highschool-early university age group from what i see . 
  older people if they smoke , they smoke standard cigarettes there was a short trend for vaping when it first poped up , but it died off pretty quickly i think, 
  or '' i want to see grandgrandkids before i die '', 
  doing quick google search i could n't find a poll that would have age breakdown . 
  as far as politics go last parliamentary elections showed that young voters tend to pick more conservative and more free market oriented parties . 
  would n't be surprised if support for same-sex marriage was similar in all age groups . 
  also in general there 's not much support for same sex marriage , most people would support some form of partnerships though, 
  not to mention the transformation expirience, 
   he company im working for is already moving most of its operations to india and firing most of its old polish staff in my company they tried it , but due to significant drop in quality , they decided to stay here - move more processes from west ( mainly ireland ) to poland , but they cut down on the migration to india, 
  you could go for a middle ground - go for something like couchsurfing, 
  pretty much any field , may be a bit better in it in my case finance/accounting, 
   would your salary be significantly different in other countries ? 
  well duh , people in the same corpo , doing the same things on the same possition get nearly 3x more in western branches of the company . 
  wages are reason why companies move their operations to poland or india, 
  aside from `` why you not getting married , yet ? '', 
  i do n't think so, 
  it 's very rare, 
  aside from kebab and pizza lithuania : potato cake & cepelinai hungary : leczo, 
  i realized that when i watched chinese/koreans/japanese doing language challanges with polish on yt, 
  it 's quite funny to troll kids by playing them slovak or czech songs - it 's confusing as fuck hearing those languages for the first time we even got few singers who sing in both languages eg . 
  ewa farna - `` on knife 's edge '' [ in polish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2v9kj-drr4 ) and [ in czech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac8v0wsjpzs ), 
  that it sounds like a tv static ( couse of all the sz , cz , \u015b , \u0107 etc sounds ) - heard that from natives of various lang families . 
  russians even got a name for us connected with that ( i do n't remember what word it was )  regarding english , the responses have also been very varied . 
  a common response is that is sounds somewhat similar to dutch . 
  that 's weird considering very few people know how dutch sounds like  / edit : found the russian word - it 's '' \u043f\u0448\u0435\u043a '' ( pshek ), 
  we got 23 of those [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_parks_of_poland ) we also got 121 landscape parks ( kind of like a lesser national park ) [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_landscape_parks_of_poland ), 
  i 'm not a fan of rap , but here 's some songs i like : - [ fisz-czerwona sukienka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bywcb1ftrhu ) - [ paktofonika-jestem bogiem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq2pabclssc ) - [ paktofonika - priorytety ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qomcjdm8cro ) - [ paktofonika - nowiny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msacahup7x8 ) - [ ascetoholix - suczki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnjokhj_sy ) - [ 52 d\u0119biec feat .

  [ fat thursday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fat_thursday ) if it counts, 
  dunno they are banned here, 
   when did you begin formal education in english ? 
  1st or 2nd class in elementary  and for those living outside of the nordic countries , did anyone formally study a scandinavian language in either primary or secondary school ? 
  i had 1 year of swedish at uni , in gymnasium and highschool i had german as 2nd foreign, 
  yes . 
  having a waltz as an anthem would be so cool . 
  imagine if people were requested to dance instead of singing ; ), 
  you mean like dorm ? 
  it 's pretty much a norm , but i 'm not exactly sure how the owndership works - usually if you want to live there you apply via dean 's office iirc, 
   i would like rota too , but would n't it hurt all the atheist 's feelings to sing `` god help us '' ? 
  dunno it 's not a problem for me, 
  i like the melody of rota way more, 
  in poland it 's really depends on the professor or department ( and what year are you at ) it can get from nearly collegue to military strict, 
  means nothing or has no meaning or can mean nothing and everything at the same time ? 
  kind of like weird pronoun, 
  and in everyday speach it has no name, 
  mayby it 's just my mind putting them to make it easier, 
  i mean polish `` y '' ( / \u0258\u031f / ) , not english also till you czech y is different from polish one, 
  everytime i hear czechs saying str\u010d prst skrz krk . 
  they do it by adding a `` short '' y : `` stry\u010d pryst skryz kryk '' that 's the case with pretty much all `` no vovels '' words in many languages - there 's a vovel added when pronounced, 
  pretty much does n't exist from winter sports only ski jumping is popular ( which is pretty big ) and cross country skiing aka `` asthma running '' got some news coverage due to justyna kowalczyk, 
  is n't that a bit cheating - there are vovels , just you do not write them ( you often add `` y '' here and there ) / edit : polish y / \u0258\u031f /, 
  weirdness of bigass continental climate yearly amplitudes ( can go from +38 ' c in summer to -30 ' c winter ) and unlucky weather front . 
  when it 's so hot it 's also very hummid making it unbearable,

  from my expirience usa is pretty rare . 
  stany is definitly most used one, 
  ameryka or stany ( states ) , less often u.s.a. pronouncd with polish letters like [ this ] ( https://translate.google.pl/?hl=pl#en/pl/usa ) full official is stany zjednoczone ( ameryki ), 
  not legal borderline acceptable - people will sometimes do that , but in the same time it 's often criticised, 
  you do n't do hot winter beer with spices ? 
  also add water, 
  lol our woodstock gets 7 times as much people,
