  ; ) it 's a pitty the music there is pretty shitty recently, 
  - [ woodstock festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xelfze-tzhg ) - in kostrzyn nad odr\u0105 one of the biggest open air festival in europe [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woodstock_festival_ ( poland \\ ) ) - [ open ` er festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwmumef0buy ) in gdynia [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open%27er_festival ) - [ jarocin festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5jjjivweg ) in jarocin [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jarocin_festival ) / edit : bonus [ gollum ( and boobs girl ) from woodstock ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjbzd_uxhgs ), 
  bonus : [ our volleyball hymn song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxvl-i8pyva ), 
  best and worst go to india as i deal with them quite often - my company tech support & big chunk of hr stuff is located there - it 's often hard to get something from them but people are adorable, 
  is n't german more popular as foreign lang in russia ? 
  played : football , volleyball & and ofc the `` fitness '' type things like running , cycling or swimming etc watched : football , volleyball , ski jumps i guess we are the only nation that can fill a football stadium for volleyball [ opening match of word championship in poalnd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfcjeyf01bu ), 
  search for your model on http://www.ceneo.pl/ , it 's price comapring site for polish market, 
   the it industry can you even function in it without knowing english ? 
   use of english pertty much everyone is learning it since elementary school , the results are so-so . 
  most university/highschoolers should be able to hold some kind of conversation recent thread about it from / r/poland https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/5tzwp8/polish_people_english/, 
  i fee most undervalued places are the nature + small villages . 
  taking few day long kayaking camping trip is really cool - you get to quite remote places - going down places like [ omulew river ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbqv_l4tcnu ) ( northeastern poland ) or [ dunajec river ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsjtjymmz-a ) ( southern poland ) are really rewarding . 
  i would like to stress that it 's the longer , 3-5 day trips are best as you get to the very rarely traveled parts, 
  gl then , it 's very hard to get to that circle . 
  consider things like international relations or international law ( and some foreign langs as bonus ) as well . 
  also most importantly get involved things like conferences , `` bridge projects '' etc so you can meet important people, 
  that includes games like eg . 
  cs , fifa , civ , heroes of m&m iii , heartstone etc ? 
  you mean hardcore gamers ( or collectors ) then . 
  it 's as weird as any hardcore hobby, 
   in finland most normal people ( especially girls ) think they are manchildren . 
  you know the type ... people who play games all the time or collect those anime statues , comic books , weird stuff , and so on . 
  pretty much the same , but i feel without the 2nd , more weeaboo-like part what do you find weird about playing games ? 
  what 's your reason for going for political science anyway ? 
  couse if your goal is to get involved in politics then courses like law , economy or finances + getting actively involved in your local politics is the way to go, 
  damn i even checked that while writting , must have copied the wrong one  <, 
  kind of - i would call it casual formal full formal would be `` jak si\u0119 pan/pani miewa '' ( or '' jak sie panu/pani powodzi/wiedzie ? 
  '' , but you do n't hear that often, 
  i guess so , but language is problem as high majority of courses are in native lang / edit : ok found confirmation :  some foreign citizens who study in poland are eligible to receive the same benefits as polish citizens ( including free tertiary education ) . 
  this principle applies to foreigners in the following categories :  - individuals who have received a permanent residence permit to settle on the territory of poland ;  - foreigners in possession of a valid pole 's card ( what is a pole 's card ? 
  -  ) ;  - foreigners with refugee status obtained in poland ;  - foreigners granted temporary protection on the territory of poland  - migrant workers that are citizens of european union ( eu ) member states , switzerland or efta member states -- parties to the european economic area agreement - as well as their family members residing in poland ;  - individuals with a long-term eu resident permit issued in poland -- what is a long-term eu resident permit ? 
  -   - individuals granted supplementary protection on the territory of poland  - eu and efta citizens as well as their family members - parties to the european economic area agreement - as well as swiss citizens in possession of a permanent residence permit .

  foreigner maches your description, 
  like english foreigner ? 
  depedns on school i guess . 
  i remember after i left my elementary , there were even one day trip to plant trees  maybe it 's due to age difference , but if i recall you 're not that much younger than me . 
  as always one of my fav traveling channel : - [ 10 signs you might be an ugly american tourist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kebjkfloefa ) - [ visit europe - 10 things that will shock you about europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsbk_yhgq8 ) - [ travel tips & advice playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhhcxdh6kfhrmiqgbcpnptb8l3pwlzm_n ) - [ visit england playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhhcxdh6kfhon5jdgzm3kmmckzbc3wllz ) - [ visit france playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhhcxdh6kfhr6hwqejgqd1wzsd5iz4yii ), 
  you did n't have to grow a small plant/vegetable as a project in elementary school or lessons about foresty stuff , where you are shown most common mushrooms ( in class , in books or vid ) and told not to pick them unless you got an adult who knows mushoorms couse you can die ? 
  it 's nothing close to what op had though, 
  we do learn how plants grow and some basics how to cultivate them , but nothing close to mini survival lesson - from that aspect we are told what not to eat in a very broad sense ( it 's about mushrooms and berries ), 
   do you guys hate us as much as i 've heard ? 
  we should make it a banner - no . 
  where people get tha from ? 
   trump it seems part of americans hate him far more than foreigners, 
  from my side no depeds on her family - it would n't like to be a reason behind her worsening/cutting off relations with her family, 
  i assume you are not a millionaire who does n't have to worry about money nor employment . 
  it 's a worthless diploma - you do n't get any qualifications nor usefull skills ( aside from mayby having an interesting conversation ) . 
  it 's one of the things you do additionaly as a hobby or if you are really talented and plan to stay at uni and write books . 
  it 's not a diploma that helps with getting employed / edit : some of the downvoters mayby cares to share their opinion, 
  there 's nearly no difference , it 's a matter if one would be even able to tell from what region someone is if the person from podlaskie is from rural far eastern part he may have a slight belarusian-like accent . 
  in reverse give away that he is from pozna\u0144 ( biggest city in wielkopolska ) may be that he calls patatoes as `` pyry '' instead of standard `` ziemniaki '' / `` kartofle '' or that he randomly uses phrase `` tej '' ( it has no meaning , just a weird gimmick ) . 
  if we took any random kid from one of the cities you woud n't be able to tell instantly where who is from, 
  eeee it 's as close as `` check '' and `` chess '', 
  [ short yt lesson vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yhrrevpy2a ) few : - co s\u0142ycha\u0107 ? 
  / short version : siemasz ? 
  --  siema ( shortened versions work as just `` hi '' , it 's very informal ) - co tam ? 
  they all mean `` how 's it going ? 
  '' / `` what 's up ? '', 
  - dzie\u0144 dobry / dobry wiecz\u00f3r ( it 's good morning , but we got only two versions - for day and night ) - less formal : cze\u015b\u0107 / hej / czo\u0142em ( literal meaning : with forehead ) / edit : bonus winter ones : `` ale/jak zimno '' ( = omg how cold ) or way informal/vulgar : `` ale pi\u017adzi '' or to make it even more expressive you can add kurwa '' before or after `` ale '' eg . 
  another vulgar way would be with `` ja pierdole '' eg . 
  - halo - s\u0142ucham ( i 'm listening ) - tak ? 
  ( yes ? ), 
  some people add their name in front eg . 
  http://www.studyinpoland.pl/en/  who wants to study political science are you sure you want to dedicate your time and money to this kind of course ? 
   we 're still stuck in the 80s and the soviet union but it does n't seem to have the dirt and rubbish that typical soviet cities got . 
  it 's pretty consisent with its style and clean leaving a rather possitive impression, 
  it 's ok ` ish , there 's still work need to be done - people dumping garbage into forests and dog poop are worst offenders . 
  worst time is when snow melts and all the shit that got accumulated during winter shows up . 
  there 's still some problem with littering , but it got much better from possitives i love the trend of cities/neighbourhoods investing more in gardening projects planting flowers/cereal in eg . 
  one of the most pro eu countries here, 
   slavic language does n't create accents you are wrong here . 
  today in poland it 's not so noticable , but move as soon as 30 years back and you can tell from which voivodeship one is, 
  minsk is nice ( judging from vids and pictures ), 
   highland  lithuania , 
  it 's pretty neglected for sure ( city itself is pretty ok , other parts of the oblast are worse ) you can always use google street view , it has decent coverage ( from 2012 though ), 
  there used to be lot of variance now it 's pretty much one polish across the country with exception of : - [ silesian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_language ) ( mix of german and polish ) - [ kashubian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kashubian_language ) - mayby mountaineer dialects , but those i feel are used only as a turist attraction aside from that local accents and dialects are confained to remote villages or culture centers . 
  it 's pretty unified when people are arguing of how special their local language is when it 's literally only around 3 words/phrases that are different in general unless the person is trying hard you wo n't be able to recognise where is he from, 
  there 's sunday morning mass on one of the public channels and there 's infamous religious channel - trwamtv , which is tv branch of our biggest radio station - radio maryja , owner of which is a priest ( or rather businessman ) tadeusz rydzyk . 
  to show you his scope - via his fundation lux veritatis he 's building geotermal powerplant that is supposed to provide heating for his big church complex project jokingly called `` tajmoher '' ( [ contex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohair_berets ) ) , university , hotel , aquapark and spa in toru\u0144 . 
  the tv station has lot of standard catholic religious stuff you would expect ( televised masses and pope stuff ) and additionally is a tin foil conspiracy nest ( jews control everything , homoleftstpropaganda everywhere kind of stuff ) / edit : almost exclusivly catholic stuff , some orthodox stuff may be mentioned in news or ecumenic endevours of the church, 
  i would say / r/polska is filtered version of wykop , there 's way more shit quality content on wykop , but in the same time it 's way more active as for reddit vs wykop - it 's uncomperable due to share ammount of people on reddit and the variety of subs, 
  / r/poland - it needs some skin , as it is it looks like some forgotten sub , works mainly as a-help-foreigner-sub / r/polska - looks nice , it 's pretty much shitposting and highlights of absurd that happen in our country, 
   polish lazare is in bulgarian iirc ( bulgarian wedding song , polish band though )  you may enjoy songs like \u017bywio\u0142ak 's [ \u015awidryga i midryga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihmp6eo05jk ) ( this has [ cool lyrics ] ( http://www.tekstowo.pl/piosenka,zywiolak,swidryga_i_midryga.html ) , click on `` poka\u017c t\u0142umaczenie '' - it 's a existencialist poem by [ boles\u0142aw le\u015bmian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boles%c5%82aw_le%c5%9bmian ) ) or [ noc kupa\u0142y ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1neyaez6ue ), 
  turkish kebab stands if that counts, 
  top would be songs by alexandrov 's ensamble ( red army choir ) , i will go with [ \u041e\u0447\u0438 \u0447\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tquy3fqvcyc ) , in general i like songs in russian , another song by polish singer anna german - [ \u0410 \u043e\u043d \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6nyu950a8m ) or sog in both polish and russian [ grande valse brillante ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmzm7pcs0ug ) ( switches mid song from russian to polish ) , or prokofiev 's [ war and peace opera by anna netrebko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvzqjz6oaii ) or her singing rachmaninoff 's [ song op. 4 no. 4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fckif9gf2y ), 
  also songs for europe : [ i am european ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sora5nq17g8 ) or [ globus - europa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aitid1kixm4 ), 
  we had some midsummer vid ( could n't find it on yt ) it was surreal that adults dance it . 
  imagine after having lectures like tax law , financial derivatives , tax accountancy or international financial reporting standards you go for your foreign languge curse and learn about a little frogs song . 
  it was like an acid trip we got kids songs , but they are `` reserved '' for kindergarten also [ steffan song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5ivmfbcw9c ) rocks,
