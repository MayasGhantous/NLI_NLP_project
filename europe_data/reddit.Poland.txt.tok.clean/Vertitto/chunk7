  2 . as if it was something important ... 3 . varies from country to country , but in general it 's still best region after canada in this respect 4 . it 's overblown imo and ** most importantly do n't treat europe , or even eu as a country ** . 
  it 's completly different world from country to country . 
  sweden is nothing like italy , spain is nothing like belarus nor croatia like norway, 
   something that piketty suggests to avoid rising inequalities managed to get through the whole 700 page bible or just read the synopsis ? 
  : ) / edit : some context for people that are not that much into economy : we are talking about thomas piketty 's `` capital in the twenty-first century '' - it 's a 700page brick , it 's jokingly called `` the least read bestseller '' , 
  it 's supposed to be asset tax on top of the income one just becouse you are a bank and live, 
  it 's nothing special in the muslim world even for countries like iran or saudi . 
  they are not vampires that got burned by holywater, 
  main difference is that there was no eu pre ww2 . 
  look up [ eu 's history on wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union )  are we heading towards a ww3 ? 
  seriously doubt it, 
  wrong words , they are secular , not atheist https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_azerbaijan, 
  it 's a bit weird , in my town we had many problems with chechens , but at the same time the azerbaijani that came along them were totally cool, 
  it 's cool to listen to some finnish though ; ), 
   euro adoption is mandatory for eu members . 
  it 's optional as it 's up to you ( country ) if you make the critieria and say yes . 
  you can even be in the erm2 ( aka align the economy ) forever and do nothing more . 
  it 's just the top goal on the integration scale atm, 
  also , leaving eurozone does n't entail leaving the eu . 
  a bit too early for such threads , elections will be somewhere in the autumn, 
  please stop treating europe , european union and eurozone as one thing, 
  i find the referendum question very inconclusive had i known to what exact institutions greece owns money and what 's their situation and impact on europe it would be way easier . 
  i do n't know that so it 's pretty ignorant opinion - i would either cut greek debt and/or turn the obligations to free-0 % intrest rate along with that introduce techincal gov that would create new fiscal fundament , put finencial boundaries in constitution, 
  explain please, 
  please no , it 's one of the worst post types there, 
  it 's pretty random also there 's no lithuanian flag here , also they got the swiss flag wrong - it should be a square ( minor thing since the civil variant is `` normal '' ), 
   he even told me that black people are perceived as cool and exotic in russia !, 
  same goes for poland ( had changed a bit recently ) . 
  how else would you expect for people to react ? 
  until recently you had bigger chance to see live unicorn than a black person, 
  tak ( or `` jo '' in some regions , pronounced yo ) i nie, 
  / r/spain, 
  had just got back from my fencing club 's seasonend drinking meetup, 
  the song is collection of limericks about various national tensions around the world , this is the part about poland and lithuania . 
  fast translation just to make sense  there was a pole who treated the lithuanian with wine  hence the quarrel that arose , wine is probably to blame  clashed severely  and eagle and vytis [ two coas ]  in insults `` panisko '' , `` bo\u0107wina ''  quo vadis ? 
  vinicius would ask the sides  nothing connects pole and lithuanian today anymore  patriot [ pole ] attacks  because the lithuanian argues  that our [ polish ] poet was called mickevi\u010dius, 
  https://youtu.be/gu3cpexdbcy?t=10m13s ; ), 
  hmm never read or heard of poles going to belgium, 
  with the rate of change in poland during my life time i really got no idea, 
  wow i should also get shit ton of loans and ask people to pay them off also top kek for the indiegogo, 
  would n't having kurds have their own country outside turkey solve both isis and kurd problem ? 
  and video is down, 
  you are new to internet ? 
  as for young - dunno as for old people there 's a cult-like radio station that is always spreading weird shit . 
  in theory it 's catholic radio , but the church is not so ok with then either , they even got yellow cards from the pope himself, 
  couse homogender propaganda is taking over the world , killing everything in it 's path / s, 
  your tone, 
  he was talking about the fbpage name , hard to get anything else since the profile has been delated, 
   polish internet is going absolutely insane after legalizing gay marriages in us . 
  people on facebook are ostracizing and calling to shoot gay people . 
  wow that 's an overblown tittle, 
  they are guaranteed up to 100 000 eur/per account owner in theory . 
  atm i guess they may only suffer from lack of cash since the mass withdraw that is going on ( banks may not be fast enough with refilling cash ) . 
  they should n't lose the money unless their bank does some shenanigans . 
  if they are scarred of losing money i think they can open an account online in some other eu country and store it there, 
   3 ) what happens to all the greeks living in europe if they are kicked out of the ** ez ** ? 
  euro zone ? 
  i guess you mean eu or schengen euro zone has nothing to do with free movement of people inside eu, 
  would be nice if the union sorted itself out before inviting any country, 
   salivili hipput tupput t\u00e4ppyt \u00e4ppyt tipput hilijalleen it 's from the finish polka , is n't it ? 
  yes it is ;d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji, 
  would n't those count as polish words that have german roots ? 
  if we count such words 1/4 ( if not more ) of polish modern voc is qualified, 
  french `` allez '' as for `` go , proceed , start '' ( from fencing jargon ) russian '' \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e '' ( nieponiemaju ) - i do n't understnad, 
  it 's totally possible it 's quite confusing expirience - what you hear seems familiar , you get some words , but you have little clue to what 's really going on . 
  reminds me most of czech or slovak , but still different enough to be distinguished from first glance, 
  this tradition is dying out though . 
  when i was a kid i remember it was a standard to do those . 
  now almost none of my friends ' families do those ( mayby with exceptions where they have small kids ), 
  it was posted here multiple times, 
  easter was some time ago it 's not only a romanian tradition, 
  on the other hand palestine owes you gratitude ; ), 
   diversity it 's weird and pointless to promote diversity . 
  equality is better way to put it, 
  and poland is preparing full scale invasion along with baltics and a swedish tank [ it has been foretold ] ( https://i.imgur.com/qinlxfx.png ), 
  weird , it 's go-to expression for me , it 's way more used than `` deal with '' or any other phrase carrying the meaning in my expirience ( english as 2nd , had pretty much no interaction with native speakers - i guess movies and news use it often ), 
  not in most ? 
  it 's usually birthday til ~ 18 , then only nameday with few exceptions for some big round numbers like 80, 
  [ `` made in the ussr '' by oleg gazmanov ] ( http://lrtranslations.blogspot.com/2007/02/made-in-ussr.html ), 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si6ikqvm3ii )  the ukraine and the crimea , belarus and moldova  that is my country . 
   sakhalin and kamchatka and ural mountains  that is my country . 
   krasnoyarsk region , siberia and volga region ,  kazakhstan and the caucasus , and the baltic states too, 
  it 's quite hilarious that poland is also among the dark green countries , but still each time anyone asks for travel info there 's the `` is it safe to go to poland ? '', 
  [ lads , let 's sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcze7egorok ), 
  turkmenistan as very high ? 
  wtf did i miss something ? 
  also how can iran be lower/same lavel as iraq or syria ? 
  what 's the point of this thread ? 
  any locally brewed ( aka not designed for massproduction & export ), 
  i actually plan to do that soon along with arabic script . 
  anyway it would just be appropriate to give some transaltion if you are posting on international forum where english is the main lang, 
  small tl ; dr in english would be great, 
  / r/italy / r/travel, 
  why did you change pretty normal title into a dumb click bait ? 
  the ceremony highlighting their cultural haritage speaks for itself ; ), 
  it 's just that some people refer to those as the 4th one, 
  i love this kind of openings, 
  ever heard of poland ? 
   i heard eastern europe is far less tolerant of muslims compared with the west very often way of thinking is there are no muslims = they are intolarant and xenophobic . 
  now it 's the case couse poland does n't want to take muslim refugees in fear of happening what is now in france , germany , sweden or uk .
