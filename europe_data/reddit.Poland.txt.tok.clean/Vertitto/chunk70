  [ this post from exchange with singapur ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5sxjrc/cultural_exchange_with_rsingapore/ddisqbi/ ) does a good job explaining this in terms of poland - we got a lot safer in last 20 years , most people who caused problems either grew up or emigrated ( or both ), 
  i feel in school we focus on british , sometimes we are given american . 
  i just pronounce my way - for one i do n't care if it 's british or american english , 2nd - i have such a strong accent that it does n't metter, 
  most people know it 's some nation living somewhere in iraq/turkey that has been fighting to establish their own state . 
  i do n't think people would know anything else, 
   this is what i hate most of the austerity measures are n't those aimed primary on the gov - cutting the spending to match tax revenue ? 
   the universal basic income allows a group of people to buy stuff , resell it on the loss of value and drag market prices to the lowest , pushing for the end of capital circulation or even a moneyless society . 
  i do n't get this part - could someone explain logic behind it . 
  it sounds like complete nonsense also how is it supposed to be financed ? 
  - debt ? 
  tax redistribution ?

  it 's great for longer trips , but sucks for city driving - it 's often bit problematic to find parking space for it - [ toyota yaris 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/toyota_yaris_rear_20080214.jpg ) - small , reliable my mom 's fav , great for everyday city driving - [ volvo xc60 ] ( http://zombdrive.com/images/2013-volvo-xc60-2.jpg ) - newest one , wanted to check out some suv-like car as many friends recommended , we found decently priced volvo ( which has very good opinion in poland and we never had ny volvo car ) . 
  as for now it 's great . 
  before we used to have skodas ( i remember vectra ) and opels ( astra ) . 
  in general we are not super attached to any brand on daily basis i use public transport, 
  3 points based on false assumptions  british people and europeans will say they 're jamaican or nigerian that 's contradictory . 
  as for getting a pass - it depends - do they speak their language , do they know & practice their culture ? 
   if people should n't identify by their nationality ( as i keep seeing people say here ) that 's new . 
   i would never bring it up unless someone specifically asked me . 
  what you would do is irrevlent . 
  there are people who do that and that 's annoying,

  definitly the articles .

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5s6cv6/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20170205/ ) threads, 
  from minor ones : - brest and grodno in belarus ( were part of poland before and still got quite significant polish minirity , but the cities are rather irrevelant ) . 
  \u0141ukaszenko acts as if poland was waiting for an opportunity to grab those - mayby [ zaolzie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie ) and its town of cieszyn that has polish and czech side . 
  the region coused major butthurt during interwar - it 's really small , irrevelant region that was a couse of mutilple conflicts ( eg . 
  polish participation in partition of czechoslovakia is about it ) it 's so small you barely notice it on maps and yet was so problematic in general it 's mostly about lviv - it was one of 3 most important cities in poland ( next to krak\u00f3w and warsaw , it 's the place of our math geniuses : [ lw\u00f3w school of mathematics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lw%c3%b3w_school_of_mathematics ) - most known is probably [ ulam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislaw_ulam ) - guy behind the manhattan project and banach & tarski that are known for mind bending [ paradox ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86-z-cbaha ) ) , then there 's vilinius right behind , long , long nothing and those mentioned above / edit : bonus interwar songs about lw\u00f3w : [ tylko we lwowie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhc6zga4hrm ) and [ tango \u0141yczakowskie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acv-euqt1sy ) ( super cancerous comment sections ),

  generally yes , but i dunno exactly what `` fail-safes '' there would be for it to be a voluntary decision opposed to `` voluntary '' as for age i would go for something around the line 50 + or lethal/painful illiness or disability as for means of execution - whatever is fast and wo n't have negative effect on organs that can be transplanted ( and no opt-out from organ donation as well ), 
  lol that 's not how protests work, 
  first one is from 3rd may 1791 current one is from 2nd april 1997, 
  i would support it in a form of eg . 
  requiring visa or making it harder to get one for people from dangerous areas . 
  i 'm against a full on carpet ban . 
  as others pointed out - it 's just dumb, 
  so just hot for anything different ? 
   in poland female eastern ( belarusian , russian or ukrainian ) accents are known to be sexy . 
  dunno which male accents girls find sexy here though, 
  [ this war of mine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=balbuyotxqm ) - the flood of english comments came after the trailer , same with hungarian [ `` dziewczyna o perlowych wlosach '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fv-iwk9dwc ) [ 3rd trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gotk5dldvvi ) to make it complete, 
   i adore an accent what accent ? 
  i guess her point was more that it 's way more common than in poland, 
  you are asking people from pretty much same culture circle , i dunno what you expect . 
  from the slight differences i guess : - there 's no big butt craze like in us - surgical operations are rather looked down upon - less slutty look comapred to uk ( there was a yt vblog with polish girl describing the differences she noticved , i 'm looking for it ) to give you some idea here 's few music videos that should give some general idea : - [ czadoman - ruda ta\u0144czy jak szalona ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgw1yecwptu ) - [ akcent - przekorny los ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwilsn_5y-s ) - [ donatan cleo feat .

  never heard it, 
   ( besides communism and less money ) that 's a huge thing to put out of equation your question is a bit weird and convoluted - it switches between western civilisation and cold war devision as if they were teh same thing in some way  as they did n't have the same streams of europeanness , such as the renaissance and the enlightenment , like some currently labeled `` eastern european countries '' had so did russia and that does n't make it western europe i will answer in this way : western countries , but not western europe, 
  i would say the national pride as op called it became even more voiced, 
  i liked ea 's nhl most of all the sport games so there 's that, 
  that looks like a tumor :p, 
   no it was n't , it was against nato because nato has expanded towards russia the last decade and they originally said that would never happen . 
  any why is nato coming closer ? 
  it 's mostly russian fault of threatning its neighbours and pushing them into nato, 
   honestly , with or without stettin i would prefer a entirely polish kr\u00f3lewiec to this kaliningrad thingy any time . 
  giving it either for poland or lithuania would be better - at least it would n't be so let down now, 
  in a wide sense - shaking of communism it 's a bit bigger time frame , but i guess it 's the biggest challenge we had to overcome ( and to some degree still deal with ), 
  not really . 
  it used to be more popular back in the day , but now it does n't differ much from any other time of the year, 
   americans with german ancestry are likely to be somewhat culturally different from americans with italian ancestry , for example that does n't make the german though, 
  were there some petitions or something recently ?

  country ? 
  - pepper - salt - paprica - garlic - onion - various green stuff like dill or bay leaf from souces : - ketchup - mustard - maionese - for fastfoods also garlic souce, 
  yugo rock songs are great , polish version of [ malj\u010diki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inxdj-i-yi8 ),

  pretty much same here, 
  i 'm livin in 3city in north so norway/sweeden is just close , dunno what are other destinations ( i ' v heard there 's a cool route to odessa , ukraine ), 
  young guys who ride on speeders - seen as reckles organ donors other - positive hobbyists . 
  there are various events like [ start of the motor season ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1sgbeezuo0 ) , [ santas on motorcycles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p01vr01u2mu ) or even [ motorcycle pilgrims ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6-e-pfhhty ) and various [ meetups ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqc4dztz7v4 ) there was no gang activity connected with motors , so they did n't get the negative steorotypes . 
  among my friends who own a motorcycle sweeden/norway is popular destination for summer biking trip,
