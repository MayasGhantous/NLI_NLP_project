  it 's more focused on the arab world though for china/japan/korea `` far-eastern '' term would be more common the widest definitions is mostly used for food, 
  reddit is quite obscure in poland , it 's know mostly by geeks - which in turn are mostly men, 
  similar scope to yours i guess - from turkey , north africa , middle east through india to china , japan and korea . 
  word is neutral/possitive, 
  in poland - lol no this should give you some perspective : in 2014 police weapons were shot during a whopping 25 incidents ( i dunno if warning shoots are counted in this or 2nd category ) and used ( pulled out eg . 
  force some behaviour ) during 115 incidents source : [ official police stats ] ( http://statystyka.policja.pl/st/wybrane-statystyki/bron/bron-uzycie-przez-poli/51797,uzycie-broni-sluzbowej-przez-policjantow.html ) ( labels : ' 93 - '12 total incidents of justifaid weapons used and warning shots ; since 2013 they differenciate into two categories - i guess it 's used-shot and used in anyway ) . 
  aside from the part of the police that deals with serious crimes , pretty much all officers use guns only during trening if anything [ examples of police hopelessness ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxb56otenwg ) gets into compilations last incident of overusing power i remember was last year when police beat some football hooligan so badly that he died / edit : you should watch [ nordics vs american police documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbm9ucxejdm ) to get more or less how it works here, 
   here in poland we consider them to be a part of asia . 
  what ? 
  never heard that, 
  historically [ polish golden age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_golden_age ) , it 's pretty much the same for turkish people over all : probably now, 
  not really, 
  in my be a problem in some pubs ( orders under x ammount , usually it 's 10pln + ) or in flee markets/newsstands . 
  in my case over last 5 years i used cash only for my hobby classes / edit : may also be a problem in small rural shops, 
  we got subject called `` wiedza o spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie '' ( knowladge about the society ) and it 's concentrated around constitution , trias politica , legislative process and bit of eu structure . 
  i do n't think we had any doctrines there . 
  they were however briefly talked about on history lessons from my expirience that subject was mostly treated as one of the less important ones , kind of a filler, 
  this circlejerk is really annoying, 
  we are comparing him to kaczy\u0144ski, 
  trump at least wo n't let the economy to go down, 
  nothing , shit ton of overreaction since trump got in office chill down, 
  i guess / r/askhistorians will be a better sub for this question, 
  mayby city panorama would be a better word, 
  not exactly - we skipped the arcade era all together and consoles were super expensive for just for fun toy . 
  after all you could buy pirated ps games as well without a problem, 
  those are when-alcohol-starts-to-kick-in party songs, 
  it 's a freaking black dick that looks like some failed photoshop, 
   the poles i have met these last months have all been from the rural south east though , maybe that shapes my perception .

  i guess both, 
  as for mentioned transport - tall housing can also be problematic as transport infrastructure may not be ready for increase of people . 
  przymorze and zaspa districts in gdansk are good example of that problem, 
  depends where - i dunno if people hate tall buildings in warsaw . 
  for some cities tall buildings ruin the skyline . 
  wroclaw is best example of how you can easly fuck it up same goes for style - it 's hard to put something modern looking right next to old buildings for it not to look extremally tacky/outofplace, 
  same in poland , we are android and pcmasterrace stronghold, 
  not exactly the current migrant weave , but in general north africa/middle east negatively affected the perception of safty in bigger cities in france/netherlands and to lesser extent germany,

   krakow is a great city to live especially if you like the smell of sulfur, 
  it 's symbolic mark of stalin 's ownership of poland, 
  there were multiple petitions over the years . 
  as for now people got used to it as it became a symbol of warsaw . 
  the compromise is to surround it with skyscreapets so it does n't dominate the skyline, 
  depends they are ok for warsaw ( that tries to hide the palace of culture , [ skylines ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=warsaw+skyline&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjjirh4sdnrahxjapokhueobwqq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=892#imgrc=_ ) ) 3city is having few higher buildings ( eg .

  for 3city trend with going up in districts like przymorze or zaspa begins to couse some transport problems i do n't think krak\u00f3w / pozna\u0144 / wroc\u0142aw are happy with having skyscreapers in their skyline ( eg .

  if i could more or less retain my standard of living it would be the alpine region , mayby portugal or slovenia/croatia - rather some medium-small town , picturesq and slow region,

  not their fault that english did n't get the concept of alphabet right,

  for wc3 imo polish version was better than english, 
  pretty much only english . 
  there are few exceptions that have good voiceovers eg . 
  latest witcher or warcraft iii if the game world ( no made up languages ) enables that i love when characters use their native lang + subs ( same for movies ), 
  automatic ever since we got one in my family . 
  it 's nowhere near it used to be ( like in russia or ukraine ) , but it 's still not germany , sweden or denmark i guess the biggest problem is people not cleaning after their dogs, 
  there is no such thing as a major in our system , these are names of curses ( bachelor/engineer/master ) 2014/2015 : 1 .

  pedagogy source : [ gazeta prawna ] ( http://serwisy.gazetaprawna.pl/edukacja/galerie/873307,duze-zdjecie,10,10-najbardziej-obleganych-kierunkow-studiow.html ) ( based on data from ministry of higher education ) [ list with highest number of students per place for few unis ] ( http://www.perspektywy.pl/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=967:najpopularniejsze-kierunki-tego-roku&amp;catid=22&amp;itemid=119 )  there 's a big push for stem ( science , technology , engineering , mathematics ) here in the us while the humanities are somewhat discouraged . 
  many young people scoff at `` soft '' majors like history and fine arts . 
  same here, 
  depends in what manner , there 's some lines that you should not cross . 
  media/politics are more strict about that , but generally yes - it 's quite common to shit on eg . 
  muslims . 
  working in corpo , there 's no problem with making fun of everything, 
  any car , winter tires, 
  i always need a second to think whether it 's slovakia or slovenia and sometimes they use really weird shade of blue for luxemburg making it confusing ( same thing for italy/ireland - if the flag is enchanced with weird effects or presented in an unusual way eg . 
  in form of small shaded sphere , it 's hard to say at first glance ) also i dunno if i could say whether it 's moldovian , andorran or romanian with coa . 
  definitly not from first look, 
  so many stories like that happen involving gypsies that the situation i gave as example probably sounds very likely ( even taking into account it happened in a poor country like macedonia ) to most european redditors, 
  it 's pretty meaningless without the full story , it could have gone like eg . 
  them being evicted from illegally occupied house , being pregnant she was offered a stay in hospital/singlemom facility , but declined . 
  it sounds bizzare , but stories like that happen, 
  do you have the authorities side of the story ? 
  never seen or heard about it, 
  not really . 
  they are given all the rights and help but they activelly reject them not wanting to be part of social system .
