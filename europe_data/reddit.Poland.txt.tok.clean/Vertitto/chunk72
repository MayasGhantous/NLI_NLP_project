  there are various communities of gypsies in different countries , some are a bit like amish people in us ( doing their own slow life somewhere outside , not cousing any major problems ) other more known are just crime groups, 
   i meet a lot of `` western '' people who think that everyone behind the former iron curtain is incredibly racist towards the poor ( literally ) gypsy minority . 
  it 's europen wide , not eastern european . 
  it 's americans who got very romanticised view of gypsies, 
  same as it was . 
  not much will change unless brits do something really dumb, 
  i was refering to both - answering machines ( these are super obscure ) and voicemails  were these not common in poland at some point in the past ? 
  nope , mayby just for a little while and fizzed out really quick just like eg . 
  pagers or faxes, 
  kind of , few castle/palace places do witcher schools eg . 
  - [ moszna castle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpbjxqirck ) , [ some vblog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itwiorwy5vw ) - [ grodziec castle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyr5av3w3gm ) / edit : here 's also [ schindler 's factory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm23pu85-fo ) in krak\u00f3w, 
  no doubt about that, 
  does n't ethnicity go deeper ? 
  citizenship : polish , nationality : polish , ethnicity : kashubian, 
  you get weird `` but why ? '', 
  country ? 
  for the name it 's maria ( marysia/mary \u015bka for diminutive ) , maryja is only for the saint i believe ; wiki says maryja is archaic form til mariola , maryla , marzena are essentially other forms of maria, 
  you could concentrate on smaller regions , not short trip with bigass distances , where you lose both time and money on moving from a to b, 
  it does n't really go into nationality aside from statistical demographic ethnicity pools or when it comes to helping polish culture outside poland citizenship boils down to bureaucracy - passport , id , voting etc, 
  polish legislation says who can get polish passport , not nationality citizenship = / = nationality, 
  do you believe army being multinational played bigger role than eg . 
  the way it was paid for ? 
  what about overseas territories of eg . 
  france or netherlands ? 
  flair up, 
   do you have much experience with peoples full names ? 
  throughout my education i ' v met just a handful of people with middle names . 
  in work enviroment people are usually not required to give the middle so hard to say . 
  it 's more common with older people though, 
  the way you asked - everywhere and nowhere, 
   unless you 're aware of migration that occurred within the last few generations ? 
  those migrations are pretty much irrevelant . 
  you are not eg . 
  polish couse your grandparents were from poland, 
   why is that ? 
  couse of the `` my grandgrand father 's cusin was from sweden so i 'm pretty much swedish '' kind of americans, 
   in my experience most polish people have middle name that 's weird , from my expirience that 's mayby 5 % of people, 
  the double names are very rare , maria used to be moderetly popular ( it 's not considered a weird nor a rare name ; popularity : 26th in 2005 , 14th in 2014 , 13th in 2015 ), 
  it was kind of sanctioned - poles started few cases against teutons ( that raided catholic poland and newly christianised lithuania ) , vatican worked as a mediator trying to work things out . 
  in the end teutons lost the processes and refused to fullfil their obligations . 
  poland also paid stupidly high taxes to vatican to get in their favour . 
  couse of all of that teutons lost their possition , which probably laid fundaments to their secularization later on, 
   what do estonians/lithuanians think about the teutonic state period ? 
  teutons moved pretty fast away from christianising to land grab for monies . 
  it was so apparent that we even got green light from vatican to fight them . 
  they are not looked from crusades perspective for the most time, 
  prussian one is also very cool, 
  it 's ok from historical/imaginary ones the [ plc flag ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/ericflint/images/a/a7/plu_flag.png/revision/latest?cb=20120804203019 ) one is pretty cool , i like the portugal style flags - coa in left center and horizontal lines . 
  i would save the pointy ends [ lazy paint with modern colors and coa ] ( http://imgur.com/a/a4vg2 ) ( normal red instead of the weird shade we got would probably look better ), 
  or quite the opposite - thanks to blocker culture getting hyped about patriotic things , it become very tacky and a bit frowned upon, 
  when interacting with people from other continents, 
  being pro russia and mayby being abstinent or vegetarian/vegan, 
  just using english in daily life - mainly media ( games , books , news , internet , movies etc ) - things that force you to think in english opposed to activelly translating things i 'm rarely speaking though , which is very noticable - i got super strong polish accent and problems with picking words on a fly, 
  very general , non-academic blocks , i will try to put some nice terms . 
  there 's no such emphasis on generation as there is in us . 
  at uni most lectures often just copy the american authors , which imo is wrong those who grew up : - in the interwar called [ generation of columbuses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation_of_columbuses ) - during/just after the war ( very tough , hard working people ) - during communism ( this can also be split deeper ; you often hear that people born in communism are fucked up by the system - passive , pessimistic , without social responsibility ; [ homo sovieticus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homo_sovieticus ) - it still seems to be pretty apparent in russia ) - during end of communism/transformation ( if i had to somehow decribe i would use `` can do '' - generation ) - during `` internet era '' ( it 's not seen as harshly as in us , but in general people very easly discouraged ), 
  you mean link to wikipedia box ? 
  having people proclaiming someone else 's love is really weird, 
  i do n't think we got such thing we got dank memes though eg . 
  - [ party like eu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbbynqzgj8o ) - [ brexit parody ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adl7o6dwqss ) / edit : i found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oktpric7mma ), 
  the question is pointless since most of the participants are not picked yet, 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ygc1oi.png ) sums up my knowladge of albania, 
  are they ? 
  i thought they were buddies with romanians, 
  is it actually happening ? 
  i ' v seen that model few years ago , anything started happening ? 
  there 's pretty nice business center being created in gda\u0144sk oliwa/przymorze . 
  i do n't have good picture that would show it from a good angle ( [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/etkd4qz.jpg ) each shot focuses just on its own compelex , have not found any that wouldhave all 3 together ) . 
  there 's : - [ alchemia offices ] ( http://torus.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dpp07df09160d2741.jpg ) ( 4x11-12 floors + one is under construction with more planned for future ) - just across the road there 's new university buildings of gda\u0144sk university , you can see few shots on this [ promo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0drff4bcsu ) ( there 's some wider shots in 2nd half of the vid ) - and also olivia buisness center offices [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2asnmpm6a8w ) with new [ olivia star ] ( http://1.static.s-trojmiasto.pl/zdj/c/n/12/1722/1000x0/1722856-nowa-wizualizacja-biurowca-olivia-star__kr.jpg ) that will be the tallest building in 3city ( 35 floors 180m ; next being [ sea tower ] ( http://www.seatowers.pl/jpg/zdjecia/w_03.jpg ) in gdynia 142m ) being planned to be completed this year it 's all right next to each other and looks great , espcially during summer evenings ---------------------------- also that 's realy weird shot of warsaw naples looks amazing, 
  a bit - kind of like ginger or fat people i guess, 
  i did n't phrase it very well - it 's more that i find azerbajan bit more interesting than the other two, 
  - belarus - it 's super close and looks pretty cool - montenegro - looks amazing on pictures and it 's cheaper than let 's say croatia , slovenia or italy - ( kind of europe ) azerbajan - nothing in particular about it , but i would like to make caucasus -  iran trip ( with iran being the main point ) and azerbejan looks to be most interesting caucasus country to me, 
  banking services ( online banking , paypass cards , phone payments , paperless backoffice processes etc ) / edit : also voting - having an id is a problem ? 
  rather never , depends on the context in which the swearing happens, 
  not for schools or hotels ( you are required to change shoes in schools though ), 
   along with being fairly priced ? 
  what does it mean ? 
  look up [ walters world channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/woltersworld/playlists ) he does great travel videos and also look up [ feather nad the wind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uco_btbktpylvm84f3ulb2rq ) - they are a canadian couple going around poland , hungary and now croatia, 
  note : there 's no such thing as collage nor there is a concept of minor/major . 
  most of what you listed would be done during highschool from my bachelor economy studies , aside from standard there were blocks : - 2 semesters of physical activity ( you could pick various things like gym , volleyball etc ) ( 1,5h-3h per week ) - 3 semesters of specialist foreign languge ( mix of law/financial/economy / accounting english or german ) ( 3h per week ) - 2 semesters of 2nd foreign ( 3h per week ) - 1 semester of `` humanistic '' subject ( philosophy , sociology , history of economy or psychology ) ( 1,5 h for week/2weeks ) the most bullshit , filler classes come from the core curses that exist only to fill the ammount of hours needed/provide something to do for doctorates ( usually it 's different names for the same thing with very slight differences ), 
  i liked previous post ( the deleted one ) way more, 
   lighthearted note . 
  and where 's beer and meat ? 
   and due to be scrapped in june this year that 's for real or just another soon \u2122 like it has been since forever ? 
  i guess [ zaolzie region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie ) - it 's small piece of land on the polish-czech border that has been source of few conflicts ( eg . 
  during polish-soviet war or partitions of czechoslovakia ), 
   large numbers or with shorts eg . 
  1ty\u015b ( 1 000 ) , 1m or 1mln ( 1 000 000 ) , 1b or 1bln ( 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 ), 
  what exactly would you like to study ? 
   vinn\u00fd - guilty / made of wine same here , it 's written as `` winny '' though, 
  first that come to my mind from everyday simple words : - nearly noone can pronounce vovel + rl words eg . 
  `` girl '' , `` rarely '' or `` early '' - many people got problems with `` comfortable '' - it 's not that it 's hard for poles to pronounce it , but it 's one of the words with retarded spelling . 
  we are used to pronouncing every letter so shit load of people say `` komfor-tabl '', 
  ofc that 's part of of what philology studies are about in case of polish - it did n't change that much compared to other languages over last 1000 years - we can read old texts pretty fluently compared to eg . 
  english that is completley new language now, 
  i did n't say the other half is skin colour ( though for many people it also matters ) , had mainly cultural aspect in mind . 
  nearly the whole europe is part of [ bologna system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bologna_process ) that more or less made the higher education similar . 
  there are some small variations . 
  more or less for poland : - so such thing like college or undergraduate - entry based on [ matura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matura ) exam results - generally free education , public  private - types of unis : university ( general one ) , politechnics ( centerd around hard sciences ) , medical and various speciall ones ( eg . 
  navy , music , police etc ) - degrees : licencjat ( bachelor ) 3-3 ,5 years , in\u017cynier ( engeener , equivalent for technical studies ) 3,5-4 years , magister ( master + 2-3 years more ) and doctorate + various specs ( after masters eg .
