   restaurant let 's be serious no restaurant even serves fries , it 's bars/fastfood stands, 
   but many have heard their main cultural export .

  dunno about what to see , but they are pretty know for their wine  moldova as obscure within europe as it is in the us and is there any reason to visit it ? 
  it 's seen as obscure , poor and let down region in poland and even in ukraine . 
  that should give you some perspective . 
  their capital in polish ( there 's polish names as the region was a polish fief for quite some time and a front in wars vs ottomans ) sounding like some random village does n't help either . 
  looking at google pics and some docs , there are some nice looking places , but i guess if you are looking for some rarely visited places it 's safer and more rewarding to go to eg . 
  bosnia , montenegro or belarus, 
  masters in finance & accounting , one of the biggest polish aglomerations ( 3city ) : 3,5 k pln gross , it 's considered to be decent, 
  dunno what `` under the radar '' counts for you exactly . 
  safe bet would be crossing out uk , france , spain and italy and here you go ; ), 
   the polish milk maids or whatever lol those were hilarious song sound really weird in english [ original version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ) another song from them : [ bra\u0107 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trwo1xbv6e ) and song that kickstarted the project [ nie lubimy robi\u0107 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvkzyul7ubq ), 
  from the normal songs : [ edyta g\u00f3rniak - to nie ja ( eurovision 1994 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl5rmmpihp8 ), 
  a blank spot at our eastern border . 
  despite having very similar culture and language there 's nearly no interaction between us ( small border trade , bigger smuggling , and we host and partially finance some of their alternative media/prodemocracy institutions ) from what i hear lukashenko has pretty big genuine support . 
  life generally is normal there . 
  problem starts when you want to get involved politically or to have a bigger business there was pretty detailed thread about belarus here or on / r/europe , should be easy to find, 
  average house size is 139 sqm average flat size is 73,4 sqm average prices per sqm in biggest cities : http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/raport-z-rynku-mieszkan-wrzesien-2016-7476514.html ( `` pierwortny '' orange is new , `` wtorny '' blue is old ) , you got breakedown by metrage below median earnings for 2014 is 3291,56 gross ( 2/3 would make it nett ) i will post pictures after i get back from work,

  depends on the teacher and literature . 
  polish ( aka literature in our system ) was one of my favs subjects ( only in highschool though ; i hated it in gymnasium and elementary ) , but had i had to read stuff like the sorrows of young werther again i would just cut myself . 
  definitly german, 
  well polish modern culture ( media , arts ) is very weak . 
  we were all about america after '89, 
  polish & maths in elementary school i had obligatory chess lessons with some armenian ( ? ), 
  chess grand master , i loved those, 
  we do n't really have lot in common with hungary culturally, 
  i do classicial fencing ( smallsword , sabre and rapier & dagger ) and from time to time sport fencing ( epee ) / edit : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exukoqjpn28 ) kind of thing, 
  it 's `` texansish '' as unique , but the steorotypes are pretty much only negative ( ugly , polluted and unsafe region ), 
  literally yes , but it 's used only for christmas and easter, 
  happy holidays sounds really fake and out of place imo . 
  in my work we make fun out of it we use `` weso\u0142ych \u015bwi\u0105t '' ( = merry christmas ), 
  definitly the eve . 
  2 next days are just filler, 
  i do n't think such song exists here, 
  and rachmaninoff, 
  there are presents for employee 's kids from some kind of internal social fund . 
  it 's usually bag of sweets or some event, 
  why to pick capitals ? 
  would n't smaller cities/towns be a better option ( calmer and cheaper ) ? 
  in english ? 
  those that mean something and create dumb puns eg . 
  turkey or hungary, 
  add y or i between r and p, 
  in general you need to have 2 foreign languages at school : you start with either english or german in elementary school ( by far most people start with english ) in gymnasium ( 13-16 yo ) you need to pick 2nd foreign language . 
  i could pick from : german , english ( for those who started with german ) , french or russian . 
  in my school the propotion were more or less : 60 german , 30 russian and 10 french ( all started with english as first foreign ) in highschool the same thing : continue your first foreign ( english or german ) and either contiune or change 2nd foreign ( same list as before ) at uni i had business english + had to pick one extra foreign , i could chose from : german , french , spanish and swedish ---------------------------------------------------------------- in my case : native : polish 1st foreign : english , pretty fluent ( c1/2 ) 2nd foreign : german - i was learning it in gymnasium & highschool with very low success 3rd foreign : swedish - had 1,5 year at uni , also very weak i also know bit of arabic and hangul ( korean ) alphabets, 
  definitly a recognised brand , nothing big though . 
  i do n't know anyone who plays/played the table top game ( probably cosue it 's expensive as fuck ) , few of my firends painted the figures for sale as a hobby though ( wh :40 k ), 
  never seen one here .

  classical music in general, 
  yes - doing/writing off your homework, 
  mainly for americans, 
  fell of communism was a pretty significant process that defined over half of europe . 
  how many socialist countries are there in europe, 
  generally no , but there are days i start to understand how being patriotic got a bad name in western countries, 
  holland - holandia is the standard name for netherlands 2 . also very common 3 . super rare, 
  i guess so , 
  most people do n't know shit about the religion , nor do they pray . 
  statistics that lump things like church attendence or do-you-believe-in-god as religiousity give a skewed image, 
  for poland church has been very active politically and culturally - it harboured independence , anti-communist movements and did a lot in preserving polish culture during occupation/partitions . 
  religiousity infact is not that high, 
  using the opportunity - could someone make a tl ; dr of xi 's presidency ? 
  only things i ' v heard from him is related with the aiib and connected with it new silk road project, 
   it might be cheaper to live there , but to get a job in any of those countries while only speaking english - that 's too difficult unless you 're extremely lucky not really , at least not now, 
  use search it was asked not so long ago https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5ek3c2/how_is_napoleon_bonaparte_seen_in_your_country/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/549m1m/french_people_what_is_the_current_opinion_of/, 
  ah those , ok, 
   how limited freedom of speech is in poland what do you mean ? 
  what exactly ? 
  on the other hand he 's pro market and pro space `` exploration '' so it can go both ways, 
  1,87 m - pretty average for young guy , mayby bit above the average people are generally not super concernded about their hight . 
  the only thing is magical ration : man 's hight  = girl in high heels hight, 
  formal school : pan/pani professor + optionally last name uni : pan/pani + [ academic title , doctor + ] pan/pani = mr/mrs / edit : i should also add when using pan/pani alone it 's usually with `` prosz\u0119 '' which works similar to english `` excuse me '' eg . 
  - `` excuse me sir , could sir explain how does it work ? '', 
  kids are taught to adress in such way from kindergarten . 
  it 's so hardwired that it can take many weeks to make them call you by your name , even if the age difference is not that big, 
  ok it works now ; seems firefox derped, 
   our pkp is a joke was , it 's kind of ok now, 
  i would add to the list : ukraine : [ cossacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cossacks:_european_wars ) series ( rts ) poland : [ earth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/earth_2140 ) series ( rts ) i spent quite some time on those, 
  first link does n't work, 
  - facebook renting group for location ( from my experience it 's the most effective way for searching both flat/room or people ) - city 's forum - olx.pl - gumtree.pl, 
  as for that it 's pretty hilarious - iirc it 's perfectly legal to carry a sharp sword around ( as long as it 's not concealed eg . 
  in form of a umbrella ) , but it 's illegal to carry a telescopic bat ( or certain types of `` potentially dangerous '' blunt weapons ), 
  only an air/pneumatic gun , but i guess that does n't count i ' v handled real swords ( sabres and smallswords ) though, 
  i guess japan , but recently there has been lot of things happening with china by no means either ties can be described as close though, 
   aldi after googling it seems it exist in poland , but i never seen it  2 it has little do to with safty . 
  it 's just a system that has been a thing since forever - you put a coin and take the trolley  3 depends on shop size . 
  never seen sea food/lobster tanks in poland  4 baggers are not a thing here . 
  you go to the counter and pack your things, 
  seems poland , belarus ( buffor ) and russia,
