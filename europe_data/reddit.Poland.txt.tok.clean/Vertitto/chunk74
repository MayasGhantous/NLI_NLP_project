   so i just do n't know what that feels like to give you some perspective how such low temperatures feel ( i 'm familiar with continental cold only ) - it 's often no longer `` cold '' ( unless there 's wind , wind and humidity change the perception drastically ) , it 's more of a pain ( pinching-like feeling ) and hands/feet get numb pretty fast . 
  i do n't think there 's feelable difference for temperatures below -20 ' c it 's just the cold that makes jeans turn hard , skin turns red and your feet/hands get numb quite fast such low temperatures were very rare and during nights . 
  for day most i remember seeing was something around -28 ' c, 
  local temp = / = official one anyway i 'm from region close to suwa\u0142ki ( podlasie ), 
  you may find [ number of sun hours ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ncp9moz.png ) useful poland is in transitional continental climate ( dunno how exactly it 's called in english , in big tl ; dr : hot summers and very cold winters ) as for seasons we got ( or rather had ) 6 seasons : - lato ( summer ) - pretty hummid , temp around 20-35 ` c , random heavy rains and thunder storms , [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3-irhzny6e ) from this summer in gdynia - jesie\u0144 ( autumn ) - we got two types : 1 ) ( called polish golden autumn ) warm 10-18 ` c , very colorful [ this kind of thing ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/61484515.jpg ) or 2 ) cold , rainy , foggy and gloomy [ like this ] ( http://www.polskiekrajobrazy.pl/images/stories/big/150398img_kor.jpg ) - now first additional season - przedzimie ( `` before-winter '' ) - from around november it 's starts to be cold 5 - -5 ` c , less rain , first snow can happen , trees got no leaves , days are getting very short now [ this shows it pretty well ] ( http://variart.org/img/works/544/73446.jpg ) - zima ( winter ) - it used to be really cold ( i remember over -35 ' c nights ) and often snowy , very dependant which front gets to us - eg . 
  siberian - very dry , sunny , no wind but extremmaly cold or arctic - snowy and windy , bit warmer or from black sea - hummid , warmer . 
  lately we had max of 2 weeks of real winter , it 's pretty much przedzimie the whole time . 
  we are one of the nations that is baffled by countries where people do n't have to go to school/work couse few centimeters of snow fell - 2nd additional season - przedwiosnie ( `` before-spring '' ) - reversed przedzimie - snow is stil mealting , but plants are getting green [ like here ] ( http://swissaroma.ch/myblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/przedwiosnie_zalasewo19.jpg ) - wiosna ( spring ) - colorful , weather can be really random - one day can be close to 20 ` c , while next can be 5 ' c or even small drops below 0 ' c during nights [ some standard pic ] ( http://www.ciekawepodlasie.pl/image/6571/park_planty.jpg ), 
  you can see them , but they are super rare . 
  most are porbably germans coming for vacation trips, 
  same here + jews, 
  never heard of them being here, 
  from non street/fast food types i would add hungarian leczo ( hun . 
  never heard any hatered thowards napoleon . 
  there 's only some resentment as he took advantage of loyality of polish forces .

  whole 5m high , 
  swedish or finnish / edit : i would also add russian for songs, 
   outside of the most cosmopolitan cities it will also stick out in cosmopolitan cities, 
  do you have songs about it ? 
  tbh i quite like those especially when they are done my military choir + orchestra . 
  / edit : also our medival `` anthem '' is also about mary : [ bogurodzica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p2pr6kuxta ) get on our level, 
   today jesus was intronised as the king of poland btw what was the logic behind it ? 
  ok , let 's even leave the concept of making religious figure a king of smth - it 's a bit dumb idea when mary is already the queen of poland, 
   and is in general pretty religious . 
  different kind of religious though . 
  i do n't think you will find american-style religiously ( by which i mean things like knowing/reading the bible , home praying etc ) anywhere in europe, 
  [ if europe was usa , which state would you think your country would be most like ?

  block i live in was build in '80 something ( iirc ' 86 ) highschool i went to celebrated its 400th birthday few years ago though , ( [ promo vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36_zhrntecq ) ), 
  my hometown : [ \u0141om\u017ca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1l-rgxnpeu ) ( eastern poland ) ( + [ happy \u0141om\u017ca ( pharrell williams - happy ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glsx8zw1xws ) ) where i live now : [ 3city ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqap7luzdai ) aka [ gda\u0144sk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4df8q3r247q ) + [ sopot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnbwcxsvd7e ) + [ gdynia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeixsjynjga ) ( northen poland , seaside ) you can also find few 4k drone vids, 
  and to begin with czech are real country, 
  at highschool we usually got english as main foreign lang and we could pick from german/russian/french as 2nd ( in my school the proportions usually were like 6:3:1 ), 
  i 'm from small/medium town - \u0141om\u017ca and went to study into 3city when i was a kid i remember that being religious was a negative thing for a young one - you would say that one is `` nawiedzony '' and often ended up in ostracising such individual . 
  there was just a standard to go to church on sundays , but if you were the believing type you were being considered as some wacko . 
  being openly atheist however was more okeish , just created opinions of `` noone cares what he thinks , he should n't really say such things '', 
  imo russian/ussr anthem is the pinnacle of what anthem ought to sound like, 
  hard to say , it 's not a thing you talk about . 
  i would say most people fell into category `` i do n't think about it '' or catholic , but not religious . 
  ( i guess culturally catholic would be a term that describes it best ) from my childhood religious people were pitied and made fun of . 
  in poland the standard is that you go to church ( at least for hollidays ) , get the sacraments like baptism , first communion , confirmation or marrige . 
  going to either side - being religious ( except for old people , they can be religios ) or hard atheist is frown upon, 
  jag sagt inte att jag kan tala pa svenska  ( do n't waste time correcting me , i 'm awere it 's wrong ) i suck at it - not only i had just the basics , but also i have not used it since . 
  to make matters worse i had german in gymnasium/highschool , which i also have not learnt/used enough to be comfortable with and they both started to mix in my head . 
  i 'm planning to pick one of them again in the near future though, 
  i was learning swedish on uni as 2nd foreign and i would describe it as german with italian melody . 
  i picked swedish couse i loved the melody in which the language is spoken and these are my fav songs in swedish : [ staffansvisan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozmv5p0loes ) and [ lil pelle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1j8mpqmvc ), 
  if you mean old-fashioned ( medival-like ) way then no . 
  any form of nobility status was removed during interwar , shit ton of people died during interwar & ww2 and then communism ( probably most importantly ) happened erasing what was left . 
  we got few `` nobles '' ( you could probably count them on your hand ) , mostly living abroad . 
   is class not a thing in post-warsaw pact countries ? 
  it 's not a thing in most countries afaik , uk and mayby france are the exceptions, 
  on avarage something around 10pln ( 2.27 eur ) , atm a whopping 200-something, 
  they lied to me in elementary school then ;(  `` dzban , u\u0142ana , barana '' / `` dzbany , u\u0142an\u00f3w , barany '' i though they were just random variations on words like it 's always done in polish , while first group being meski and plural forms being meskoosobowy . 
   you can distinguish five genders in polish . 
  it 's not so impressive - it 's standard m/f/n and plural form of those , where f and n got the same form ( so singular m/f/n and plural m / not-m ) . 
  i would n't really call it 5 as genders / edit : apparently it works differently from what i was taught : there are 3m types : m-person , m-object and m-livingthing + f and n, 
   1st war not mentioned  2nd half sentence trivia from cold war lessons ( and probably only becouse it 's very prominent culturally )  3rd not mentioned, 
  i can get most of major ones , but everything falls apart when regionalised versions kick in, 
  yea ofc , but i 'm talking about all the other bureaucracy . 
   blueberry pancakes along with apple pie that looks like [ this ] ( http://images-gmi-pmc.edge-generalmills.com/36452ba2-648c-4c67-90f7-3a1fc36cf6f4.jpg ) from cartoons, 
  it 's rather that reddit is not a popular site in most countries, 
   what do you think about that and what do you think the people of france will think about a bunch of right wing americans trying to manipulate french politics ? 
   reddit subs lol, 
  big companies that still do n't want to accept scans, 
  where is `` here '' ? 
  treatement of russians in baltic countries, 
  now make a round asking people from baltics how it looks for comparison, 
  never seen it . 
  i guess it 's only a thing for people super serious about their diet . 
  people just add things based on expirience/eye/remember more or less how much their glass/spoon has, 
  lol , only few people participate in it from the whole uni ( and that 's only the biggest unis ) . 
  where did you get the idea that it 's mandatory ? 
  is there any country that falls into the putin cult ? 
  ( mayby aside from serbia and moldova ), 
   i do n't think russia is `` invading countries '' at all , it is merely protecting it 's interrests it 's still invading . 
  would it be ok if eg . 
  poland launched an attack on lithuania to take vilnius back ? 
  after all there 's big polish minority and the city has polish history , or mayby kaliningrad as it cuts off part of our entrance to baltic and works as russian military base that threatens us . 
  those would be actions in our interrests , do you think it would be ok to invade those ? 
   they have created this situation themselves by treating these ethnic russians as garbage second rate citizens , instead of embracing them as fellow citizens at the new start of their country after the division of the ussr could you give any examples ? 
  is n't latin used during liturgy in vatican ? 
  that 's pretty original and nice . 
  i always heard from english/irish/swedish / norwegian/german or even russian speakers that we sound something like tv static , dril or hairdryer / edit : for other redditors few examples : - [ most popular tv quiz show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu0wgtpsm2e ) - [ most recognised lectors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mivzexs_kma ), 
  illusion coused by doubble letters . 
  we got some of those : sz ( / \u0282 / ) , cz ( / t\u0361\u0282 / ) , dz ( / d\u0361z / ) , d\u017a ( / d\u0361\u0291 / ) , d\u017c ( / d\u0361\u0290 / ) , ch = h ( / x / ) , rz = \u017c ( / \u0290 / ), 
   ( does it really sound weird ? ), 
  that depends how they will pronounce it : ), 
  the whistle language from one of the spanish/portugese islands ( looking for vid about that ) / edit : got it !, 
  : [ silbo gomero ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0circjoica ) , it 's a form of spanish from canary islands that uses whistling instead of `` speach '' [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silbo_gomero ), 
  i 'm strangely optimistic about that - if played correctly we could finally have normal relations with russia . 
  depends where eu ends up fitting in there, 
  the fuck have i just read, 
  poland is already on the china bandwagon . 
  imo in general as eu we should improve the relations , but not making them fundamental,
