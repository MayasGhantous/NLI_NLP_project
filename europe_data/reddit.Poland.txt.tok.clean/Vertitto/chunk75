  nope some teens just work on their own during vacations / edit : vocational school - their education has apprenticeship component, 
   it 's cold and wet here . 
  and flat , 
  putting estonia and lithuania in the same bracket with slovenia is super weird . 
  also non is eastern europe ( you could make a case for estonia and lithuania , but not for slovenia ) few short vids : - [ how powerful are the baltic states ?

  for us it 's recreation of polish state after the 123 years of partitions , it 's our [ independence day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_independence_day_ ( poland \\ ) ) ww1 alone is not a thing people really talk about , it 's already a war far away in history like napoleonic wars , that people are detached from, 
  / u/naughtywarlock bonus : few songs from the r\u00f3wnonoc project that spowned [ our 2014 eurovision entry ( the song with boobs ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ) , the project is a collab of polish rappers in slavic stylised songs - [ donatan r\u00d3wnonoc feat .

  chada , s\u0142o\u0144 , sobota - niespokojna dusza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwhopuz-sp4 ) so for the rhymes i would say languages like polish are more suited for rap compared to english as our grammatics and sentence structure allows more flexibility, 
  much less than european , but i still look at this as something from my part of the world, 
  actually i 'm rather optymistic about this aspect - if played correctly it could put end ( or at least tone down ) the demonization of the two camps . 
  it depends where eu will be placed in all of this ofc - will it be part of the co-op or will it get allienated, 
   i have a theory that because english is a fusion of germanic , and romance languages , we have more words to rhyme i dunno what one has to do with other few polish classics : - [ fisz-czerwona sukienka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bywcb1ftrhu ) - [ peja/slums attack - kurewskie \u017bycie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txhif_bvpes ) - [ paktofonika-jestem bogiem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq2pabclssc ) - [ paktofonika - priorytety ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qomcjdm8cro ) - [ paktofonika - nowiny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msacahup7x8 ) - [ ascetoholix - suczki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnjokhj_sy ) - [ pezet - ukryty w mie\u015bcie krzyk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42zppvlt9ek ), 
  you can go to pretty standard central europe round with cities like dresden , vienna , krak\u00f3w , prague , bratislava and budapest . 
  you can expand it by going south to slovenia & croatia for sea or east with cities like chuj-napoca ( ro ) , bukarest ( ro ) or lviv ( ukraine ) . 
  or amsterdam --  berlin --  poznan --  3city or warsaw --  baltics ' cities --  st. petersburg --  moscov ( or expand with minsk and kiev ), 
  hmmm we also need some description for polsat, 
  make a krakow , vienna , prage , budapest circle ( or go south from there ), 
  we call it `` zakwasy '', 
  yea and it 's considered to be the sandwich ( = kanapka ) in poland, 
  ee the default sandwich is n't open ? 
  how are name names organised - from closest generation to oldest ? 
  like name / father 's surname / mother 's surname / grandfather from father 's side surname / grandgrandfather from father 's father 's side surname ? 
  is there a way of instantly recognising whether the surnames are from grandgrandfathers or grandmothers ? 
  person : pole/poles , polish people generally wo n't find polack , which is considered offensive in us , as a offensive thing - it 's how we call ourself in polish and many nations use it as well language : polish adjective : polish, 
  hmm so it 's just a personal thing . 
  i like the surname-name order much more and prefer to be addressed by surname in non casual environment . 
  ( i also generally find it easier to remember people via surnames ), 
   i find it a bit dehumanizing why is that ? 
  only one i can think of is that we use both orders : name-surname and surname-name and from gramatical side cases & masculine/femine form apply names & surnames so when given foreign names or polish names in other languages we sometimes derp out ( i imagine it 's the case for all languages where names change , it just sounds dumb to say `` poles elected andrzej duda '' where in polish it would be andrzeja dud\u0119 or americanized version of polish femine surnames eg . 
  caroline wozniacki instead of proper caroline wo\u017aniacka ) from interesting things femine surnames can depend whether she is married ( it 's just a trivia that polish people will get , but it 's not used often anymore ) eg . 
  going after the money ? 
  i would probably go for ukraine/belarus - close , similar culture and language , same type of beauty and i would have bonus for being educated guy from west, 
  credit cards are not that popular here . 
  there 's no circlejerk about credit score  is it standard to need credit to buy a car or house or would you only buy if you had cash for most of it ? 
  if people got cash they use cash, 
  graphic in question : http://www.fallen.io/ww2/, 
  a bit exeggerated but yes - when it comes to european theater most credit goes to soviets . 
  it 's mostly a response to ` murcan \u2122 banter `` but we saved you from nazis '' when it comes to pacific theater , it is barely talked about - comes down to pretty much only pearl harbor and nukes ( and i mean it , on history lessons it boils down to 1-2 sentences ), 
  it 's not seen as honest/genuine in many countries, 
  in general : focused heavily on poland , next on europe ( a bit from a french perspective ) , next western world . 
  asia , africa and latin america is barely mentioned more or less : - the rivers civs ( egypt & euphrates-tigris civs ) - ancient greece & persia ( from greece 's perspective ) - ancient rome , roman empire - charlemagne and the frankish kingdom , hre - poland kicks in and from now it 's poland-centric with occasional jumps to general european/western history ( eg . 
  crusades , renaissance , exploration , reformation etc ) - partitions of plc , since now any major war is also looked from polish involvment and independence movements perspective - short jump to funding of us - napoleonic wars - industrial revolution - ww1 - reestablishment of polish state , war with soviets and all the interwar jazz - ww2 - cold war & newest history . 
  you go through it on all 3 stages ( elementary , gymnasium and highschool ; each time in greater detail ), 
  or just take food from some home-made food restaurant . 
  getting frozen pre-made food from shops is very low - it 's neither cheap or healthy, 
  or fake friendliness, 
  i assume couse he/she is constantly running back and forth bringing stuff, 
  those damn belgian warmongers, 
   because i suppose that sub ca n't have any content aside from picture galleries and threads about how awful immigrants are you got so butthurt about a simple rule that questions go to / askeurope ? 
  as for ww1 - the standard narrarion of front/allies in europe , biggest battles etc. 
  most focus goes to polish couse - battles where polish armies fought , independence movments and what led to creation of polish state . 
  as for the horror part it 's not something significant , ww2 takes most of that . 
  ww1 is treated more like the old wars ( like medival ones or napoleonic ) , ww2 grabs all the scene for both horrors and heroes . 
  in pop culture ww1 is nearly nonexistent, 
  the main beef i ' v got with public transport in 3city is that the heating is turned to freaking 900000 ' c during winters ( seriously plastic can melt when left on the heater ) , like wtf ? 
  people are wearing winter clothes to be warm in -25 ' c for gods sake . 
  the fact of there being no wind and people breathing is good enough / edit : in general i 'm very satisfied with transport in 3city ( punctual & mostly modern ) , most problems come from the people using it . 
  when it comes my homtown , which is rather a small town - i ' v not used it in good 5-6 years , i ' v seen they modernised their fleet , which is nice . 
  there 's no night buses and they are rare outside the rush hours , but that 's a typical problem of a smll town, 
  i only use my car for trips to my hometowns for bigger holidays ( ~ 400km and i often use blablacar instead ) and if i need to bring bigger ammount of gear for when i 'm coaching kids . 
  in my hometown i also end up using car as my parents live on the outskirts on day by day basis i use public transport : buses , trams , trolleys and skm train ( kind of like metro for 3city ) . 
  you can play around with routes on [ jakdojade ] ( http://trojmiasto.jakdojade.pl/?locale=en ) app ( just set for day other than tomorrow and in some normal hours - there are night buses/trains , but not as oten as during the day ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_drinking_age in poland they will ask if you look below 18, 
  google maps : vinna-prague/budapest are around 4h by train, 
  we also got weird history segment with japan poland and japan cooperated after ww1 ( iirc we supported eachother 's case after ww1 ) and during ww2 ( [ polish-japanese secret cooperation during world war ii : sugihara chiune and polish intelligence ] ( http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=81050 ) ), 
   you ca n't denied that she also had a lot of links with france as well i do n't think anyone does . 
  when it comes to simple question `` what nationaly are they ? '', 
  france is pretty unlucky as both figures were iirc rather adamant about the answer to the question, 
  citizen = / = national ( the word may be badly picked , but i use it for the sake of making a distinction ) citizen - is one who has legal citizenship of a country national - more connected with ethnicity and culture ( this is the part we refer to when we say that someone is french , polish etc ) afaik french do n't have this distinction with curie and chopin it 's mostly their own opinion - both considered themselves to be polish not french, 
  yes, 
  i do n't remember , i got a feeling they did n't sub most what he said - like the small comments he makes in czech . 
  it 's fun to understand those knowing most did not  just watched the episode when he describes their first day on atalantis ( the long speach where he says how it started to emarge from water ) and it 's not subbed , so i guess non of what he says in czech got subbed  it 's `` jdeme , jdeme , jdeme . '', 
   makes sense , but after rewatching it 5 times i still ca n't help , but hear `` reme , reme , reme '', 
  i ' v only heard about pozna\u0144 's [ rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=rogal+%c5%9bwi%c4%99tomarci%c5%84ski&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=731&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjzznl7zodqahwfd5okhccxczaq_auibigb ) , wiki says there 's something going on in pozna\u0144 , but personally i never heard about anything else or details, 
  i know , but it 's also very melodic - i love the rolling sounds they make, 
  slovenian sounds like italian, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpyxfajcymy ) is close to how czech sounds to us [ zelenka from sg : atlantis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzj90p338m8 ) fits the czech steorotype perfectly ( 1:26 is my fav , reme reme reme !, 
  swedish , norwegian , finnish - i like the sound and melody czech - sounds cute and funny and russian - i like songs in russian, 
  so it 's not only [ a polish thing ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_z7o7p1b5vgehb4jwm3wuo0stnxtyj2kz.jpg ), 
   dead bodies collector in before someome thinks it 's about plague-like human bodies , it 's just the killed-on-road animals collecting unit, 
  i wonder how many turists not knowing about it get freaked out, 
  that 's really cool, 
   nowadays or plastic bootles like [ this ] ( http://www.wzgorzasmaku.pl/data/catalogue/stltyyotazoc1mb3rvlzc1njquanbn.jpg ), 
  they are used synonymously also in poland, 
  from your delated post https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe#number_of_stars  the number of stars on the flag is fixed at 12 , and is not related to the number of member states of the eu ( although the eu did have 12 member states from 1986 to 1994 ) . 
  this is because it originally was the flag of the council of europe . 
  [ 30 ] in 1953 , the council of europe had 15 members ; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member , and would not change based on future members . 
  west germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of saarland , and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region . 
  [ 14 ] twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity . 
  [ 30 ] in his 2006 book boris johnson drew attention to the emperor necklace which depicts twelve caesars , and looks ` uncannily like the euro flag ' . 
  [ 59 ] while 12 is the correct number of stars , sometimes flags or emblems can be found that incorrectly show 15 ( as of the rejected proposal ) or 25 ( as suggested by some after the expansion of the eu to 25 member states in 2004 ) . 
  [ 60 ] [ 61 ] however , the flag also remains that of the council of europe , which now has 47 member states . 
  number of stars is not tied with number of members . 
  also it 's not flag of eu , it 's flag of [ council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) ( which groups all countries in europe , minus temporarily belarus for being a dictatorship ) , eu just uses it, 
  that 's really weird question . 
  is n't it you who should answer it ?
