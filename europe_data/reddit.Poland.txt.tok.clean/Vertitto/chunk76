  or you just want to know how we think we are seen ? 
  in terms of poland - people heard that the country exist and is somewhere europe ( somewhere close to russia ) and know that ww2 started when germany attacked us . 
  some game fans may know more from history strategy games like civ or europa universalis, 
  there are people who do camping , survival trips or participate in in-case-of-war trainings . 
  never heard of end of the world/civilization collapse preppers that you can see on the discovery shows, 
  we had no literature on english lessons, 
  i would change berlin for something else like prague , budapest or vienna if possible, 
  it 's not fair you do n't have to translate ... 
  anthems do not count,

  it 's a raport about poland written from some soviet pioneer pov . 
  i could n't find english translation so here 's a fast transaltion [ lyrics in polish ] ( http://forum.gazeta.pl/forum/w,13,119806395,119806395,list_do_redakcji_prawdy_z_13_grudnia_1981_r_.html ) -----------------------------------------------------------------  i would n't like to be a pole ,  being a pole isa shame . 
   i can not trust peope like them ,  every second of them is a jew . 
   every third is a writer/jurnalist/poet ( literat )  on a cia payroll . 
   every 4th is a priest , and now  all of the three are plotting . 
   in the church casemates  they are preparing open rebellion ,  and kulak helps them ,  couse he has private field . 
   thus , hunger and all loss  because instead of meats and grain  kulak grown flowers  and he 's wallowing among the roses -----------------------------------------------------------------  i would n't like to be a pole ,  there 's even a lot of stench in the party . 
   there they build themselves villas and cadillacs  instead of ironworks . 
   and in the central committee  there 's still fractional dispute !, 
   who ever heard of such nonsense in the world  there , on television  some dude has show  as in the sejm rejected  government set of files . 
   so , someone will surely pay for that  but it happened - the people know  that they were all against  and only one - for . 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------  i would n't like to be a pole ,  there , from their dirty burrows  crawled three scoundrels  and they founded the [ kor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/workers%27_defence_committee ) . 
   demagogic slogans  flooded the entire country  and here you got : no butter ,  nor evenchicken eggs !, 
   solidarity in socialism ?!, 
   the world has n't seen that yet . 
   all our gifts ,  deceiving fraternal hand  they sold for dollars  with which they bought weapons . 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------  during nights of printed  propaganda of hostile mouths  and seriously slandered  our soviet soyuz . 
   there 's no red army grave left remaining  and there hung on a lamppost  one next to another - corpses . 
   and before the general  finally took a firm grip on them  by shooting people on each step ,  counterrevolutionarist !, 
   today the hope shines to them  that they will leave the wrong path  and they will understand , who in their history  is a friend to them , who is the enemy . 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------  polish people !, 
  we slavs !, 
   after all , we have a common trunk !, 
   and for you the sun will rise !, 
   and the day will come to you as well !, 
   when each bastard and a scoundrel will get hung ;  cowardly spy will run away  and our common camp  will enter the twenty-first century . 
   i guess that 's it . 
   / cigarette in hand twitches ... /  / and yet a signature : / a pioneer -  ivan liet szest ' , moscow . 
  denmark is a bad example then as it 's the part of geography that is ( or should be ) relevant to an american, 
  giving fringe examples is pretty ingenuine , do n't you think ? 
  is it only americans who got problems with it ? 
  i never heard any country of federal structure to make fuss about people not prioritising their federal states, 
   lol every single one of my posts is downvoted . 
  this is why this sub hurts for meaningful discussions . 
  one side just does n't want to hear anything that contradicts their existing worldview . 
  that 's just reddit . 
  keep in mind it 's often not the people you are talking with that are downvoring , but lurkers that do n't participate in the discussion, 
  does tokyo have more power than japan ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  same goes for states - they are not independent enough what would you suppose then - a groupless random entities ? 
  you need some systematic way of ordering things and top down way is most useful way, 
   you do n't think that is at all arbitrary or inappropriate ? 
  not really - country/nation has more `` legal power '' , it 's more revelant plus learning administrative divisions from bottom to top for the whole world is pretty useless ( not useful enough compared to time you need to put in ), 
  couse country  internal administration each of top 22 chiense cities has more population than dennmark, 
  depends where, 
   i find is this one i do n't think that qualifies even as bread , it 's just a weird foam, 
  polish native english pretty fluent german & swedish just a bit - had german in gymnasium & highschool while swedish at uni , have not learnt them well enough nor used them since then so they both melted into one blob . 
  i plan to pick up one of them in near future, 
  either salt or ketchup, 
  just clarifying, 
   poland is more eastern than macedonia macedonia is pretty much like eastern poland if we go by meridians . 
  poland goes a lil more east , but in the same time far more west , same time zone anyway, 
  they are the same words as for boy/girl and it 's usually used with possessive pronoun : m\u00f3j ch\u0142apak / moja dziewczyna ( = my boy/girl ) for pronounciation look up google translator or [ ivona ] ( https://www.ivona.com/pl/ ) ),

  i remember there being only running thing in my elementary . 
  we had basketball and volleball teams in highschool , but i would n't say it was something competitive - rather after school hours playing sessions . 
  if someone was good at something they were sent to profesional club, 
  not really . 
  there ; s no such thing as highschool sports closest thing to that was `` student 's culture week '' in my school ( it 's not a thing in msot schools ) , where you make various things like contests , tournaments , present your class etc. 
  mayby decorating your class for studni\u00f3wka ( kind of like us prom , but may be a bit more formal ) to some special theme or otrz\u0119siny ( wiki transaltes it into hazing , but it 's an official thing ) during studies there 's a thing called [ juwenalia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juwenalia ) ; vid from [ kortowiada 2015 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krmsphcu4gs ) - biggest one which takes place in olsztyn, 
  it 's similar to smuggling - you pass through border legally , but only due to incompetence/luck/bribe / favour . 
  or simply taking advantage of being let outside - you get allowed eg . 
  for a month , but you just screw that and leave . 
  on modern example let 's take n.korea - they generally can not travel outside , but gov sends people out , some of them take advantage of that and never come back , now let 's say guy responsible for letting you out is your friend and you convince them to let you leave with your family `` for small vacation to show them china '' , you pass the border and vanish,

  hey , you were n't sunbathing if you did n't get sunburn, 
  we also have those . 
  they are fading out though, 
   belarusian they use russian for most things . 
  when i think about it their situation is pretty close to irish-english in ireland, 
  australia along with canada & new zealand are countries that people often say that they would like to see in eu geography would be the smallest problem with the idea - there would be ton of problems with figuring out the details due to the complicated & close relations both of the countries got with us, 
  yes , but arabs live across the whole northern africa, 
  depends how the question is asked ( op did n't specify what he means ) - as cooperation/exchange or distance . 
  i went 1st route couse it 's more interesting, 
  not really that surprising - europeans are pretty used to their neighbours and the differences are not that big , with countries from the other side of the globe there 's the exotic factor , few examples from japan : - [ polish folk dance festival in osaka , japan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfablvoqeho ) - [ japan : 2500 people dancing polonaise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqsfc2j2gtm ) - [ polish festival in tokyo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bolhodsh8e0 ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mngdvi12uo ) - [ polish sabre fencing from polish-japanese culture exchange ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnk3eklvg-a ) few of my friends back from highschool are making trips to china/taiwan for such culture presentations now . 
  not so long ago polish ministry of culture sent some artifacts to s.korea iirc for polish culture festival [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsghsczu1jw ), 
  commerce : germany culture * : mayby china or japan - not exactly `` best friends '' , but there has been quite some cultural exchanges recently military : us * for closeness just open the map - there 's not that much cultural contrast between the neighbours . 
  if i had to pick one it would probably be slovakia , mayby lithuania, 
   even private universities/colleges etc. 
  are free . 
  how does it work exactly ? 
  publically financed , privately owned uni sounds really weird, 
  yes ( you pay 50-80 pln recrutation fee ) you pay for studying if : - you want to study `` part time '' ( not daily , but during weekends ) - you want to make a post grad - at private uni plus there are subsidiaries ( eg . 
  if you are from poor familiy , got decent results etc ) , especially on tech unis where from various subsidiaries and grants a good student can be getting really sizable `` salary '', 
  i recognised it from gulliver 's travels and [ kaczmarski 's song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jzo-lvfdle ),
