  never seen or heard about it, 
  wow that 's pretty hardcore, 
  my parents got a painting of mary though . 
  i ' v found the picture : [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rrig8cq.jpg ) in general quite some people got some small cross , usually near the entrance . 
  as for pictures jesus is rare , if anyone has it 's most likely some variation of [ marry with baby jesus ] ( http://www.fineartexpress.pl/images/stories/virtuemart/product/resized/matka-boska-czestochowska-reprodukcja_400x400.jpg ) or mary alone . 
  anyway in poland jesus is not the most important religious figure : 1st is mary , 2nd our pope and jesus on 3rd, 
  the nonsense you are writting in this thread is really astounding, 
   \u2022 disorganizes the enemy by complaining about everything all the time that 's a thing for nearly all countries, 
  internet people get internet ( aka mostly american ) memes/news and that would be it, 
   he could be talking about how some media in europe alter the headlines to seem more sympathetic towards the terrorists . 
  is it true for any country anyway ? 
  not from another country , but mayby someone will enjoy it : i 'm not a fan of remixes , but i ' v recently found [ matheo x ania karwan - aleja gwiazd remix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9kzj_jb_vk ) ( [ original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg1c8oat9a4 ) by zdzis\u0142awa so\u015bnicka ) , which has been sitting in my head for a good few days, 
   many european support arab terrorism in israel where did you get that nonsense from ? 
   kolysanka it 's considered to be a rather low comedy here, 
  in family situations , 3 kisses , regardless of sex , but men kissing men is not as prevalent any more in general you may use it with people you are close with ( close friends ) , men-men does n't happen at all then . 
  girls kissing eachother ( lose friends , one kiss usually ) for hello is most common hugs are more common ( in non formal situations ) , usually for goodbye, 
  for cool comedy my pick would be [ seksmisja ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088083/ ) - pretty unique sci-fi comedy  two scientists are placed in hibernation and should be awaken after three years . 
  but when they wake up , it turns out that it has been fifty years , and they are the only two males in a new , underground society composed exclusively of women . 
  movie on youtube with subs : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwh9mq8gtek ( subs are a bit out of synch ), 
  hard to say really . 
  for one it changed drastically over the last 20years for possitive - it 's not a default , bluntant thing as it used to be, 
  good writeup, 
  3 ) complete distrust/disrespect to public administration or public things lot of those thankfully changed, 
   are your languages mutually understable ? 
  yes , but it depends on language pairs and even then it 's very exeggerated - [ this graph may give you an idea ] ( https://elms.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/lexicaldistanceielangs.jpg ) . 
  in general serbs & croats and bulgarians & macedonians can understand each other . 
  for rest it 's more about how much exposure the individual has with other ( via eg . 
  media ) - usually slovaks will understand czechs ( it 's harder the other way around ) , ukrainians & belarusians will understand russians ( mostly becouse those countires are biligual if spoken pure ukrainian/belarusian to a native russian they will have problems with understanding ) . 
  in terms of polish - we can understand most from slovaks , czechs , a bit less ukrainians & belarusins ( depends how much russian they use ) . 
  the understaning is limited to some phrases or words . 
  people often say that `` they understand '' , but it 's often just an illusion as the languages sound familiar , words are simialr ( but often mean different things ) . 
  if you ask them to translate and check that it 's often incorrect,

  never noticed such categorisation . 
  it 's usually : - eastern europeans are set up in contrast with germans - eu gets put in contrast with us ( + sometimes uk ) - poland and hungary get put in contrast with slovakia and czech - iran is usually put outside of any group, 
  yes , they mostly are for storing stuff though, 
  in general it 's a plus , people who know english will answer in english instantly though, 
  any working/studying person makes eggs for every day breakfast ? 
  it 's a thing for weekends, 
  portugal would be the best pick i guess . 
  mayby some balkan countries or `` eastern europe '' if you do n't like mediterranean climate, 
  poland needed some political ally points so there 's that, 
  in terms of poland it 's pretty unified , you could mayby distinguish eg . 
  silesians , kashubians or highlanders , but it 's not something strong . 
  as for the terms : country - the land ( another word for it would be region mayby ) state - the gov 's administration citizens - people who got administrative rights ( eg . 
  passport ) nation - people of the culture block , some common history root few examples of that : kurdistan - a country that has n't got it 's own state , kurds are nationalty , but due to not having their own state they got various citizenship eg . 
  iraqis or turkish . 
  as for poland 's administrative division we got : voivodships which are further divided into powiats and gminas . 
  as for other countries it depends on the country some are treated as one eg . 
  croatia or slovakia , while others got the divisions eg . 
  uk or russia, 
  there was a thread about it not so long ago brb i will post it in a sec ok got it : [ from a month ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/50ymvg/what_is_the_first_article_of_your_constitution/ ) ---------------------------------------------------- ** for poland ** http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm ( whole constitution in english )  chapter i  the republic  article 1  the republic of poland shall be the common good of all its citizens . 
  and before that :  having regard for the existence and future of our homeland ,  which recovered , in 1989 , the possibility of a sovereign and democratic determination of its fate ,  we , the polish nation - all citizens of the republic ,  both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty ,  as well as those not sharing such faith but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources ,  equal in rights and obligations towards the common good - poland ,  beholden to our ancestors for their labours , their struggle for independence achieved at great sacrifice , for our culture rooted in the christian heritage of the nation and in universal human values ,  recalling the best traditions of the first and the second republic ,  obliged to bequeath to future generations all that is valuable from our over one thousand years ' heritage ,  bound in community with our compatriots dispersed throughout the world ,  aware of the need for cooperation with all countries for the good of the human family ,  mindful of the bitter experiences of the times when fundamental freedoms and human rights were violated in our homeland ,  desiring to guarantee the rights of the citizens for all time , and to ensure diligence and efficiency in the work of public bodies ,  recognizing our responsibility before god or our own consciences ,  hereby establish this constitution of the republic of poland as the basic law for the state , based on respect for freedom and justice , cooperation between the public powers , social dialogue as well as on the principle of subsidiarity in the strengthening the powers of citizens and their communities . 
   we call upon all those who will apply this constitution for the good of the third republic to do so paying respect to the inherent dignity of the person , his or her right to freedom , the obligation of solidarity with others , and respect for these principles as the unshakeable foundation of the republic of poland . 
  it is a big problem , but i got impression it 's more a problem among older drivers ( mostly after holidays ), 
  the change is important in this case not the state it 's in, 
  does n't derussification count as nationalism ? 
  ( after the ukrainian crisis , they started promote belarusian language ), 
  i would recommand to contact the universities first to check that up . 
  if that 's true , it may be full of verious astrixes, 
   bachelor 's in social sciences , and a minor in leadership those sound irrevelant dunno what the certificate supposed to be, 
   i 'll have to find a list of all countries with free tuition for internationals . 
  i do n't think there 's any country that offers that, 
   ljubljana is a perfect city , almost feels nordic could you explain, 
  i do n't get what 's your problem, 
  that 's completley irrevelant though to whether the notion is true or not , which i commented on, 
   he never said he believed the notion that 's irrevelant  by saying `` there 's a notion '' , you imply the opposite how is that ? 
  which i pointed out to be incorrect ( the notion , not the fact of there being a notion ), 
   that belarus and ukraine were totally bffs with russia since forever not really, 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rwrw8lm.png ) is what you said, 
  that index is n't very reliable , but always something ( bullshit methodology )  the ef epi fifth edition was calculated using test data from 900,000 test takers in 2014 . 
  the test takers were self-selected and no demographic information was collected on them . 
  the tests are used by the company for marketing and placement purposes . 
  68 countries and 2 territories appear in the fifth edition of the index . 
  in order to be included a country was required to have at least 400 test takers total,

  the statement has no sense to begin with , it just feeds on the ignorant people who got no concept of how politics/legislature works . 
  you as a citizen pretty much do n't vote on any laws in the first place , you just vote for people who represent you,

  imo things like pizza/kebab/spaghetti do n't count hungarian [ leczo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lecs%c3%b3 ) is the shit in poland , we make it a bit differently though, 
   is smalltalk ever warranted i would say this way : only with people you know, 
  yes , you can always protest . 
  the question is bit weird, 
  framed like you did it already started happening quite some time ago, 
  i dunno if that would be the case in poland,
