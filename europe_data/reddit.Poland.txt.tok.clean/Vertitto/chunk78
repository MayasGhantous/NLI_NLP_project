  ~ ~ what ~ ~ counts as modern ? 
  that *, 
  around 20-24 , 20-26 in summer . 
  in my home it was always ~ 18-20 . 
  over 20 was to hot around 15-16 is my optimal temperature for sleeping ( though i 'm one of the wird guys who sleeps with open window when there ' -20 outside ), 
   i am vaguely aware that in poland there is some neopaganism which follows our own ancient slavic mythologies it 's pretty dumb though considering there 's very little info that survived about slavic mythology . 
  the groups pretty much make things up, 
  are n't freaking all universitis partnered with something in spain ? 
  spain exists only to be a erasmus hub, 
  closest thing to that is new shop openings or before christmas carp hunts . 
  i guess both are more of a black friday thing than wal-mart , but really shameful things nontheless [ cartoon episode about the carp hunt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvzu7szpco ) [ footage from one of the shops ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzqxkx3r_5u ) lidl ( discount supermarket chain ) also has from time to time special item offers where they have some special items ( usually from more expensive brands ) on discounts , which creates `` black friday '' scenes, 
  it 's the lower case `` c '' culture in quotation marks , 
  couse it 's pointless and sounds really dumb . 
  it 's ok if someone has some real connection with the country ( speaks the langugae , knows the history and culture ) , but if it 's just `` i 'm 1/32 something + know some well know trivia '' you sound like a moron, 
  there 's a annual piknik country & folk festival in mr\u0105gowo in poland this year there were even tanks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmr5cxqfcto ( around 4:35 ) but in general it 's not popular, 
  poland is also one of the countries where he is seen as nearly hero-like figure, 
  in stats it looks kind of decent ( gets worse the closer you look ) . 
  the potential is way higher though not to talk about companies where the state owns the majority of shares, 
  whole history ? 
  not taking russia ( or to lesser extent sweden ) when we could , instead we pretty much kickstarted the scarriest russian dynasty that lasted up till communist revolution from recent : pis won the elections , we went for medium shitty to very shitty, 
  he ment that they are not [ balts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) aka from language family survivors of which are lithuanians and latvians . 
  sorry but center is around lithuania/poland/belarus border ( unless you want to cut of 5th of europe ), 
  baltic is best way to put it imo, 
  socialist means first and foremost `` not capitalist '' or `` no free market '' . 
  what we got in europe is free market economy with bits of social , not the other way around, 
  easiest way : have roots in said country or be super rich, 
  sometimes , if they are emodiment of a steorotype, 
  depends on the context the core that always stays as eastern europe no matter the context is rus countries : belarus , russia and ukraine . 
  key denominators that i assosiate with eastern europe : geographical east , cyryic alphabet , orthodox christianity when it comes to poland it depends on context - it 's ok when you speak in historical context or when your are talking about group majority of which is rus or bordering countries . 
  countries that are part of west : - cores : eu ( + iceland , norway , swiss ) + us , canada , australia & new zealand - to lesser degree : latin america , rest of europe ( including russia ) - pretty much no : turkey , - stans, 
  some cities just got different names in different languages . 
  if the name has n't been changed completley eg . 
  from konigsberg to kaliningrad ( in other words if just version of the name in other language it stays , if changed completley then changes ) , it usually stays . 
  / edit : bonus for german speakers : [ map of germany ( and lil neighbours ) with polish names ] ( http://i.imgur.com/80pf4vx.jpg ), 
  if that count as tv show , then yes . 
  i always seen it as series of short movies, 
  from poland : krak\u00f3w + zakopane ( zakopane will be crowded like fuck , it 's polish winter capital ) or 3city, 
   did anyone actually believe the camps were run by the polish ? 
  yes - not often directly , but you can hear people saying eg . 
  that polish state took active part in holocaust . 
  the weirdest part is that is that it often comes from jews, 
  would be usefull to mention your destinations, 
  it 's not about a handshake but blunt sexism, 
  we do n't really have good tv shows , from newer ones : - [ czas honoru ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1287566/ ) , [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxz2-pajdse ) - [ anna german ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2729414/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) ; [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fel7od-ugem ), 
  that 's one of the most annoying thing ` muricans say about european countries in general - socialist states, 
  well it 's mostly that she considered herself to be polish, 
  depends on the context , it can be seen as flirt . 
  another one : portraying the country as the one who always got invaded/occupied more cultural one : slavic squat - it 's not really a thing here , it 's russian / - stans/mongol thing / edit : oh i remembered another thing : there are pretty much no germans in gda\u0144sk / `` prussia '' / kaliningrad ; they all were expelled/killed by stalin . 
   technology what exactly is it ? 
  one thing that communist kind of made good was highschool - it was way higher level that it is today , made it so highschool was actually a challange , not just another easy stepping stone, 
  you do n't have a cool rhyme that children learn from kindergarden age though, 
  well polish math curriculum has also been cut down to cater to weaker students over the years ( to bust pass rate stats ) - eg . 
  i only had matrixes , limits , derivatives and integrals ( and only in core basics ) becouse my highschool is considered top level and teachers made after hours lessons so that people going to politechnics ( and curses that involved math ) made look the school decently ( university professors cry a lot about the downgrades made in maths ) . 
  ~ 20 years ago those were in standard highschool math curriculum, 
  nope - we got maths as single subject since elementary till high school . 
  it contains various math fields like : logic , functions , analysis , algebra , geometry , probability , combinatorics , statistics , trygonometrics etc. 
  they are often intertwined with each other, 
  i find it surprising you got maths broken into multiple subjects, 
  the title alone has big troll alert sign, 
  whole eu is safe , europe is mostly safe . 
  eu is pretty much difficulty lvl0 hitchhiking - safe , most people know english/german/french / spanish , very detailed maps , wifi hotspots ( you can not do it on highways iirc and it 's forbidden to camp in the wild in some countries ), 
  standard : - math - polish ( polish in highschool is pretty much literature , sometimes branches out to arts ) - history - knowledge about society ( wos , it 's about politics ) - knowledge about culture ( it 's just another polish ) - chemistry * - biology * - physics * - geography ( it 's divided into natural geography and political geography , on the last year it was pretty much only political one ) - english - 2nd foreign ( could pick from : german , russian and french ; i picked german ) - informatics ( pretty much excel ) - physical education ( aka playing football/volleyball ) - `` religion '' ( in quotations couse we did math on it , sometimes volleyball ) * i did have to do much couse i was n't planing to write matura exam from those plus : - advanced math + after school math - advanced geography - advanced english + after school english ( made cae mid year ) ----------------------------------- matura exams i took : - ( mandatory ) : basic polish : written exam + oral presentation ( my topic was : `` nietzsche and bergson 's philosophy in polish & foreign poetry '' ) - ( mandatory ) : basic maths - ( mandatory ) : basic german : written + listening + oral - ( additional ) : advanced maths - ( additional ) : advanced geography - ( additional ) : advanced english : written + listening + oral ---------------------------------------- everyone in poland has the same program ( in liceum type of highschool , aim of which is going for studies ) . 
  at the end of highschool you write matura exams ( polish , math , foreign language as mandatory + advanced and extra versions of subjects of your choosing ) . 
  depending on your matura results you get points for unis . 
  i was planning to go for economy so i had advanced math , adv geography , adv language + 2nd language . 
  in my school it was also avaiable to learn programming or to have pre uni curses that covered stuff outside of curriculum ( for math , physics and chemistry ) for other unis you typically need : - medical : chemistry , math , biology , physics - tech : math , physics , chemistry - law : polish , history , wos different unis/curses got different wages to matura results . 
  in general advanced math + language is a plus on pretty much all unis, 
  [ bialowieza primeval forest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czqejkbvo8 ), 
  it was the case during communism , now not really, 
  the english speaking ones + pretty much most big cities, 
  [ polish-hungarian friendship rhyme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) is probably the most adorable thing what kind of `` nice '' are you looking for exactly ? 
  in 2nd commonwealth 's politics are usually talked in context of [ pi\u0142sudski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_pi%c5%82sudski ) ( our national hero , pretty much a dictator ) vs [ dmowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_dmowski ) . 
  the discussion is mainly about two concepts regarding recreating the commonwealth - multicultural federation ( where we would be in federation with countries like belarus or ukraine ) ) or smaller monocultural state with polonization of minorities . 
  you have to take into account that there was a big shit fest just after ww1 couse the borders were not defined and therefore wars : - [ poland -- czechoslovakia war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war ) ( czechs take zaolzie region , which later poland retakes in partitions of czechoslovakia ) - [ polish -- lithuanian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_war ) - and the big one [ polish -- soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ), 
  there were few summers where the mosquitoes were a plague - freaking clouds . 
  one after leaving the window open with light on , there were some any of thsoe bastards that i had to get rid of them using vacuum cleaner, 
   now that it 's starting to get colder again , none really . 
  you do n't get all the life that runs from the cold outside to warm homes ? 
  i know that is the reason i ' v written the comment . 
   when more and more people are voting for right wing parties you say as if it was a bad thing, 
  [ ones that pretty much whole world aside from us uses ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/metric_system_adoption_map.svg/940px-metric_system_adoption_map.svg.png ) - metric, 
  not a all , especially comparing to things like imperial units , 9/11 , 4th july or thanksgiving, 
  yea , i know it 's one of drawback of ` murikan internet, 
  generally it 's in the `` poland under occupation '' type lessons where were taught how was the life , what happened culturally or what independence movements there were or major events around the word . 
  thing that surprised me on the internet is the `` victorian era '' - there 's no such thing in polish system , most people do n't really have a concept of it . 
  for us it 's partitions time/industrial revolution/pre ww1/spring of nations . 
  as for russian history - we learn nearly all of it couse we had non stop wars ( ever since kievian rus ), 
  it 's not a problem in poland either , it 's a problem for the overzealous , weird people . 
  i guess it 's there somewhere around things like heavy metal or harry potter books, 
  [ how i unleashed world war ii ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065908/ ) would also be good ( it 's the grzegorz brz\u0119czyszczykiewicz one ) you can find all of them on youtube, 
  for learning movies like - [ u pana boga za piecem ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178031/ ) trilogy or - [ kogel-mogel ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097676/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) + sequel would be good - they are light comedies . 
  the language is not very complicated nor are there many jokes that would require you to be polish to get, 
  depends on you job , most jobs got very fixed work schedule to the point that you need to sit in work even if all the work is done . 
  programming/graphics and selfemployment can be different . 
  flexability can come in a form of being able to pick if you want to start your work at 7:00 , 8:00 or 9:00 if it 's possible at all . 
  it 's one of low budget , amatour actors with new story each episode . 
  if you like such things then yes it 's worth it - it has the `` lol wtf '' factor ( you may need a vpn to watch it ), 
  there 's a dumb paradocumental series [ `` szko\u0142a '' ] ( http://szkola.tvn.pl/odcinki-online ) ( only in polish ) , aside from that nothing comes to my mind, 
  churches got problem with yoga couse of the `` open your mind and accept the inner peace '' thing , which for them is invitation for demonic possession, 
  for pretty much all people it 's just gymnastics never heard anyoyne irl being about the spiritual thing,
