  you can find them also in northen poland and belarus, 
  yea its same idea , but differently done . 
  if you will have a chance check the lithuanian one , it 's much better, 
   cepelinai are big stuffed potato dumplings the potato thing is completley different though . 
  ( and the filling as well as a matter of fact ), 
  yea you just went full retard, 
  they are also polish & belarusian foods . 
  i love cepelinai ( kartacze in polish ) most , but they are quite work intensive to make kugelis ( babka ziemniaczana ) is high on my list , i 'm having one right now . 
  got potato grinder so it 's no problem to make it i hate anything involving beetroot . 
  i liked kvas as a kid , have n't had it in years though also [ s\u0119kacz ] ( http://wyrobydomowe.blox.pl/resource/sn_img_3134.jpg ) is pretty nice easter cake, 
  then it 's straight up dumb imo . 
  if he wants to deport illigal people then i do n't see a problem . 
  if otherwise - it 's discriminatory . 
  as for ethnic cleansing in form of deportation i 'm split whether they are a bad thing ( eg . 
  after a war ) - it prevents further problems in the area . 
  campaigning for making it harder to come would be much better idea, 
  oh i hated that, 
  most of the region will confirm, 
  well it 's not likely here either over the ~ 3 years i ' v been carrying `` swords '' around ( i train from 3 to 7 times a week ) i ' v been asked just 3 times ( small kid who was `` woah swords !, 
  '' , some a bit drunk student and some guy who trained sport fencing back in the day that got interessed in the handle design, 
   before the russian-ukrainian war only nationalists and historians knew about it or anyone who paid attention in highschool, 
  in poland you do that if you need help/want to help , sometimes when there 's something unique ( eg . 
  i carry [ a smallsword like these ] ( http://imgur.com/a/uhdmq ) for my fencing classes so from time to time someone will ask about it ) in other cases its either some drunk or tinfoil end of the world weirdo, 
  you simply do not , noone should listen about your private life . 
  unless it 's something important , you just say you will call back or switch to text, 
  lol no , it sucks, 
  i had impression it was an italian cartoon when i was a kid, 
  where the weird people live , 
  - [ kozio\u0142ek mato\u0142ek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kozio%c5%82ek_mato%c5%82ek ) ; [ episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgpdyvmtp9m ) - [ reksio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reksio ) , [ episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-83ms-gqsfm ) - [ moomins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_92y0jgfq ), 
  that sounds more like london thing not french or russian, 
  the dancing is not all read the [ translation of the song ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sm%c3%a5_grodorna ) , it 's brutal, 
  that 's just social norms for behaving in public spaces , not introvert person problems, 
  so everyone is a true german ? 
  mayby similar font to what we got on reddit . 
  it 's more or less what i use, 
  i kind of had to unlearn it - my writting was unreadable and my teachers told me to write in printed letters ( that 's the term for opposite of cursive , right ? ), 
  quite common , many people just use something inbetween though . 
  pure cursive you only do in early stages of school/kindergarten . 
  / edit : also cursive is not some big deal in poland , you just lern to write , noone cares what how you do it as long as others/you can read it . 
  never seen it being a topic in any discusion . 
  when it comes to writing there was only some fuss long time ago about writting with only right hand ( if you were left handed they would forcefully teach you to use right hand ), 
  it 's about the phrase in this case , not the word : if you mean inside its should be `` in '' ( = w ) , not `` on '' ( na ), 
   french and russians strongly dislike the way british people say ` thank you ' and ` please ' where did you get that from anyway ? 
  plus in a bus scenario you also annoy all the surrounding people, 
   it is a shocking event if a stranger holds a door open for you that 's normal , mostly expected thing to do  or tries to start a conversation . 
  this is weird , why would you ? 
  that song is really dope . 
  it was the highlight of my swedish lang curse at uni . 
  there was also a cool sankta lucia song ( or mayby christmas ) , but i do n't remember the title - it was something with steffan iirc / edit : got it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozmv5p0loes , the [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5ivmfbcw9c ) is also really cool though, 
  - go to [ jasna g\u00f3ra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasna_g%c3%b3ra_monastery ) is considered one such thing - from more `` normal '' things : something connected with alcohol or use the right curse word in a genuine manner, 
  mistake non the less, 
  as well as special and \u0141om\u017ca, 
  those are words , pharases , grammar structures that hopped over from russian to polish, 
  max 23 eur and i ' v bought only couse it 's my area of intresst and they had most up to date info needed for my degree paper ( it was more of a private purchase than need for uni ) normally we do n't need to buy anything , if we need something that 's not in the library or there 's to few of it we just make xerocopies ( if there are no pdfs on the net available ) i paid some fees for not returning book to library, 
  not really hardest , but people got problems with : - ortography : \u00f3 or u , ch or h , \u017c or rz - russicism : pod rz\u0105d instead of z rzedu , prace na budynku instead of w budynku etc - not using declination eg . 
  instead of dam to rafa\u0142owi they say dam to dla rafa\u0142a - saying posz\u0142em / wzi\u0105\u015b\u0107 instead of poszed\u0142em / wzi\u0105\u0107, 
  it 's easy , noone would have problems with it . 
  it should n't even been that hard for other slavs tbh, 
  i do n't remember which language it was ( i got a incling that it 's bulgarian ) they got the word that is pronounced as `` cipa '' which means `` cunt '' in polish, 
  look up / r/erasmus /, 
  not the kind of movies i would watch over and over again, 
  so an inbred habsburg can not be a far-right nut ? 
  [ wiki about the project ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica ), 
  at least while hyped for prospect of going and to have better chances to be picked to go i learned hangul alphabet and few basic phrases , 
  i always found krzyzacy extremally boring , i liked potop & ogniem i mieczem much more ---------------------------------- my post with polish historical movies compilation from another thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4et7y8/what_are_some_good_moviestv_shows_about_your/d236643, 
  for the most part it 's exotic - my way o thinking was if i could go studying abroad why not go big ( ug had or still has exchange with uni in daegu in s.korea ) . 
  i would have something to talk about , not the known , boring places around mediterranean that everyone were picking . 
  i will be regretting dropping the idea for quite time probably, 
  actually `` you '' also do think of gang stuff when hearing `` mass shooting '', 
  i did n't . 
  wanted to go on an exchange program to s.korea instead during my bachelors ( economy ) , but then n.korea got heated up more than usual and i ' v decided to drop the idea . 
  couse of that i missed out on erasmus recruitment window . 
  on masters ( accounting ) i did n't go couse of the ammount of stuff i would have to catch up ( not much material would get transfered ) . 
  now i regret ;(, 
  kind of - i mean it 's in a early stage since 2011 with not much going forward ( at least according to wiki ), 
  few polish classics - sci-fi comedy : [ seksmisja ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088083/ ) - after a failed cryostasis experiment two guys get unfrozen far into the future where men are extinct and world is run by women - ww2 comedy : [ jak rozp\u0119ta\u0142em drug\u0105 wojn\u0119 \u015bwiatow\u0105 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065908/ ) ( = how i unleashed world war ii ) - it 's the [ grzegorz brz\u0119czyszczykiewicz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ) movie , story of guy who gets thrown around the various fronts of ww2 - polish communism in a nutshell - [ mi\u015b ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082755/ ) ( = teady bear ) - folk comedy : trilogy of [ sami swoi ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062228/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) + [ nie ma mocnych ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071907/?ref_=tt_rec_tti ) + [ kochaj albo rzuc ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077814/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) , history of two village families , story picks up right after ww2 when families are getting resettled after border changes from ukraine to now western poland ( most of the comedy comes from the languge so it will be hard to watch uless you are very good with polish ) ; in the 3rd movie they are invited to us ( it was made in 1977 during cold war so it 's interesting how they portrayed us ) - dark commedy/drama [ dzie\u0144 \u015bwira ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330243/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) ( = day of the wacko ) , bitter life of a frustrated divorced teacher who stays in the vicious circle of his numerous obsessions - it 's really depressing, 
  imo yes i would like to see an european energy megaproject similar to the pre war german one with solar panels on sahara . 
  this could both help stabilise north africa and help with green energy for europe, 
  long toasts are rather rare - without toast , where you just do a gesture with your shot by lifting it up ( i include it couse it 's a bit like a salute - a non verbal toast ) - various usually short intentions toasts eg . 
  most common `` na zdrowie '' ( = for good health ) , `` za [ instert intention ] '' or '' \u017ceby [ inster event to happen or not , eg . 
  \u017ceby wojny nie bylo = so there 's no war ] - short phrases eg . 
  `` do dna '' ( = till the bottom/till the last drop ) , `` na drug\u0105 n\u00f3\u017ck\u0119 '' ( ~ for the 2nd leg , logic is that first shot went down to one leg and we need to balance things out ) - short phrases that do n't really have any meaning eg . 
  `` no to myk '', 
  but immigrants ? 
  i ' v noticed mostly turists/shopping trips storming the old town and galeria ba\u0142tycka, 
  i do n't think we got lot of russian immmigrants to begin with - what you usually hear are just russian speaking ukrainians, 
  water + lemon + optional mint leaves, 
  still the same thing - absurd  how they are killing your economies few places got less turists , but that 's it ( come visit polan instead , totally worth it )  followed by the increase in terror attacks this has some legitimacy , but still - it 's mostly frence ( [ over time ] ( http://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2016/03/articles/body_1 ) ) and probability of something happeing is still close to 0, 
  you got no idea how dumb that sounds . 
  had we ' v gone with such assessment us would be considered a 3rd world warzone not really the best source , [ but good enough to put things into perspective ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/gmaps_rankings_country.jsp ) . 
  when it comes to eu it 's pretty much same as canada - standard precaution : watch out for pickpocketers in turisty areas and dodgy areas at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lfe4nos-eo, 
  from where are you and where do your parents plan to go - i mean dombass in ukraine can be bit dangerous now, 
  there 's no such sound in english , german or swedish i think watch [ polish course - lesson 1 alphabet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20pdtdsqt3y ) - he gives the letters alone and in examples ( we got lots of letters and [ norway can suck it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488ujaqgmw ) ) also if you happen to go to poland , it 's usefull to learn how to pronounce letters - unlike english our alphabet covers all the used sounds and it corresponds nearly 100 % with what 's written making it quite helpful when trying to read names and such, 
  same thing seems to be in georgia , they got european flags at their border crossing with turkey [ google ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/place/sarpi+d%c4%85browa+g%c3%b3rnicza+sp.+z+o.o./@41.5222128,41.5478668,3a,75y,205.98h,99.65t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-77nobual9fw%2fu_gkg24dgzi%2faaaaaaaam1c%2f91p2oz6-diyzje3t4wr_hpgu0vdw9flmgclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-77nobual9fw%2fu_gkg24dgzi%2faaaaaaaam1c%2f91p2oz6-diyzje3t4wr_hpgu0vdw9flmgclib%2fw203-h101-n-k-no%2f!7i4000!8i2000!4m5!3m4!1s0x4716def46cdbff19:0x5f50e0b0b2139136!8m2!3d50.3365254!4d19.3422048!6m1!1e1 ), 
  we are talking about european languges though where in some language families you got both latin and another or even in one language, 
  hmm do n't other slavic languges already got the missing letters ? 
  some of it did n't make it , but in general yes . 
  both got great old towns . 
  they are not like warsaw , which was literally leveled to the ground short vids : - [ pozna\u0144 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1z_pue7ule ) ; short [ drone vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goujrewstlo ) - [ wroc\u0142aw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfmsfrksuhu ) , some recent [ vblog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svnxg8edbqs ) , short [ drone vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dekhclpr-1w ), 
  with prospect of studying/living in 3city ( ~ 750k aglomeration at the seaside ) with my brother , parents bought us a flat so i ' v got 64m flat , 3 rooms , one goes for rent .
