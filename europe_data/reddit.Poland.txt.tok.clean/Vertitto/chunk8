  people are negative thowards radicals . 
  polish people due to lack of exposure to islam often have many wrong steorotypes that are often reinforced by what they see in the west ( most people got no idea what the religion is about , or even simple things like that persians and turks are not arabs ) in regard to `` normal '' muslims reactions are rather nautral / edit : also try not to call poland , hungary , czech , slovakia eastern europe , cold war has ended couple of years ago , use [ central ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ), 
  tatars are the main islamic group in poland ( they live in north-eastern part of poland in podlasie region ) . 
  they have been living here since the 14th century . 
  we never had any major tensions . 
  they are integrated in polish comunnity to the point that even far-right organisations are ok with them . 
  in talks regarding islam , they are often not even taken into the equation as they are seen as just polish . 
  in an essence they are best example of peaceful integration - they still practise their culture and at the same time fully partake in polish one . 
  on the other hand , there are muslims that are often radical and foreign born that on each step couse problems , do n't have slightest respect thowards other people , want to impose their way of thinking/living on others etc. 
  if we talk about islam as a doctrine itself - it has elements that are against europen values , but then again such elements can also been found in christianity or any other religion . 
  all depends on how you go about it . 
  depends on muslims . 
  islam itself is not a threat , polish tatars are best example of that, 
  you got weird perception of what normal is, 
  eee so germany is not a european power atm ? 
  is n't it like going to poland and saying `` happy partition day ! '', 
  / edit : how is it viewed in russia ? 
  it was hard time i imagine - their `` superpower '' collapsed , economical reality check showed in how deep shit the country is ... 
  fair enough, 
  i ' v seen it here at least 4 times already using search before posting helps http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=russians+are+coming&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on, 
  how many more times it 's going to be posted here ? 
  oh i totaly forgot about it i hope there will be streams for fencing, 
  not more rare than the english-english ones imo, 
  i 'm talking about english articles from non-english countries, 
  you got such articles . 
  written in english does n't mean english pov, 
   social europe what articles would you expect ? 
  comparing to all other currently avaiable i 'm in for it, 
  all my hopes are in petru 's nowoczesna.pl now, 
   8 boys and 20ish girls . 
  fuckin awesome !, 
  pe was awful though , was n't it ? 
  to little to make decent teams and too much if fused with another class, 
  numbers from 24-32 in my schools , some curses were split into smaller groups ( eg . 
  languages or some exam subjects ) . 
  i liked that format . 
  / edit : context : ~ 60k town in eastern poland, 
  cool repost from yesterday, 
  ww2 - the war where superpowers from around the world had to stop rampaging poland from taking over the world . 
  look up [ woltersworld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdmxsop743m ) 's yt channel . 
  i love his vids ( spent countless nights watching them ) . 
  he has vids for various countries and regions , many good tips and compilations, 
   while southern europe does n't have as much gdp per capita as northern europe , it generally has more homeownership http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate  germany seems to be the only country in europe where pretty much everyone has a decent life and relatively low household debt ( aside from finland , which is in recession ) . 
  https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-debt.htm open eurostat or oecd sites and start scavenging ; ), 
   there 's a greater diversity of countries in the west that are close to each other oo open a map and look up different countries , i sense immense ignorance ; ) going eg . 
  balcans , central or east will save you ton of money . 
  also if you will plan to visit the obvious places like eg . 
  louvre , make sure you order tickets beforehand online ( if possible ) - it will save you frustration and ton hours of standing in queues during the season, 
   i assume that southwestern/west/south europe would be the ideal places why are you excluding north and east ? 
  i wonder planning to go to the steorotypical destinations everyone goes ( aka london --  paris --  italy or spain ) ? 
  simple advice : clear up some ignorance and make a search round ( yt , wiki , google etc ) about each country ( at least the cultural capitals ) and try to pick someting you find interesting . 
  picking the standard few places everyone knows is boring and unimagiative , waste of opportunity imo . 
  it 's awesome to be able to tell stories and show pics from cool places not many people got knowladge of ( in us ), 
  best part is that he looks very chechen, 
  europe is not a country visit / r/belgium nearly all use [ bologna system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bologna_process ) , each country in different variation though . 
  everything depends on country , university and course you are attending, 
   also ukraine , polland and estonia for constantly bulling russia . 
  it 's easy to bully smaller and weaker kids , not our fault, 
  polan not so stronk any more :(, 
  does n't belarus and russia hold grudge against lithuania ? 
  latvia , estii or iceland oppose to other small countries like liechtenstein or luxembourg they are not super rich shady bastards a bit bigger , silent countries like slovakia , mayby slovenia would also be high on the list, 
  / r/france or / r/travel are places more suited for such questions, 
  there is a russian rock song `` born in ussr '' or something like that . 
  it explains russian attitude pretty well, 
  use search, 
  same goes for songs ... 
  and why is that ? 
  now i feel offended couse you use russian-origin phrase thowards us . 
  i would love if russia got to be part of eu someday ( wishfull thinking though ) so that whole european continent is together, 
  so just like us ? 
   imagine europe was a single country so europe is n't a country ? 
   btw `` east europe '' ( ... ) simple thing that screams that one has n't got a clue about europe, 
  ask on country specific subs, 
  and from there to krak\u00f3w / wroc\u0142aw / sudetes mountains or west to dresden/leipzig in germany, 
  [ rawr !, 
   a new study has officially proved that french are smelly and dutch , germans and scandinavians are the cleanest ones . 
  and did n't even bother to post any link nor even mention what study, 
  you are making absurdly big leaps here . 
  your way of looking at it is literally like : situation : `` telling a kid to share toys in kindergarten '' your reaction : `` it 's just propaganda to instal communism '', 
  and it 's all becouse of having respect to other people . 
  damn, 
   the anti-racist ( anti-white ) crusade that the leftist politicians and activists are waging ? 
  ever heard of reptilians ? 
  they are behind it, 
  lol where are you getting that from ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'm getting trolled here, 
  how has it anything to do with being against racism ? 
  it 's even hard to read what you ' v written here . 
  it 's white-power level of bullshit . 
  aside from the show being cringewothy and weird ( like most of children shows ) there 's nothing wrong with the message, 
  ah did n't notice that they are autogenerated, 
  why is propaganda of good manners forced on children , while even some adults do n't have them ? 
  ~ ~ i wonder who are the people translating such vids ~ ~, 
  pretty cool tbh / edit : english subs ruined the song for me . 
  not knowing what it is about makes the song better, 
   you give an `` l '' a cerebral hemorrhage weirdest discription of the letter '' \u0141 / \u0142 '' i ' v ever heard, 
  important note : for english speaker, 
  [ wiki : university rover challenge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_rover_challenge#teams_and_results ) is almost as if we could into space, 
  yes ofc, 
   ** countries ** ~ ~ the balls ~ ~ have amazing adventures .
