  flat costs : annual average around 750 pln/month ( that includes everything : water , gas , electricity , media etc ) nearly the whole cost gets covered by the tenant . 
  needed a buffor for russia , 
  make your mind then for teaching you are limited to ireland i guess unless you want to teach english, 
  basics - budget , subject ? 
  hmm poland , serbia , russia , serbia , croatia , catalonia , scotland ( well independence movements is cheating ) ? 
   about you 're mother what is this ? 
  are you a ` murican ? 
  3city , [ guide ] ( http://guide.trojmiasto.pl/ ) - cheap compared to rest of eu - big city , but without big city feel - lot of forrests and hills ( surrounded by landscape park , [ panorma ] ( http://1.static.s-trojmiasto.pl/zdj/c/1/127/1600x0/1271556__kr.jpg ) , [ pic i made in sopot ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gybbi ) ) - has sea ( baltic , but always something ) - academic/turist aglomeration - sopot is party capital of poland [ sopot 4k ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjiul7op5eu ) - gda\u0144sk has cool old town [ 4k vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvknnzurjsi ) - gdynia has ships , cool beach and [ open ` er festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open%27er_festival ) , [ gdynia drone view ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skmysswd3im ) - well comunicated ( both public transport and has airport , marine port , train etc ), 
  it 's different kind of religious though praying in home ? 
  reading bible ? 
  anti-science ? 
  bumper stickers/banners ? 
  noooo * for all those `` but jesus is christianity '' - not here , he 's 2ndary religious figure in poland ( or 3rd if you count our pope ) - it 's all about lady mary here, 
  they also got spicy food ( at least for european standards ), 
  i do n't think you will find anything that is even close - there are countries that share single aspects , but are complitely different in all others if i try hard mayby swiss ? 
  they are super conservative , rich and love guns, 
  i guess they are no longer in europe then , 
  how the hell then they are able to influnce what words people are using ? 
  - lisp - problems with pronouncing single letters eg . 
  r/l or \u0105 / \u0119, 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  looks a bit of hussle for administration/business pov as you need to get everything processed by the languge council . 
  it has some censure ring to it , i do n't think such thing could pass in poland, 
  i guess most get light polonization by which i mean they get treated gramatically as if it was polish word eg . 
  sending email - emailowa\u0107 , pretty much all the recent loanwords are english so english pronunciation is used . 
  example from german : in silesia region ( silesian dialect aside ) people often use german word for train - `` zug '' instead of polish `` poci\u0105g '' so they would say `` jad\u0119 zugiem '' ( i 'm taking a train ride ) there 's also a thing called nowomowa or korpomowa ( ~ new speach / corporate speach ) where you mix english with polish , it 's seen as a negative phenomenon , examples ( i will write with polish spelling , couse it 's weird ) : sfinisziuje kejsa asap i mo\u017cemy i\u015b\u0107 na brejk , a po robocie skoczymy na szoping / version with english spelling : sfinishuje casea asap i mo\u017cemy i\u015b\u0107 na break , a po robocie skoczymu na shoping from annoying things there 's also people/companies not using polish grammar for names , brand names are worst offenders eg . 
  ( i make shopping in carrefour ) advertisers use `` robi\u0119 zakupy w carrefour '' instead of `` robi\u0119 zakupy w carrefourze '' ( [ cejrowski mi sie przypomnial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuny6e9henu ) *  ) * for french speakers watch from 1:30 where he gives examples how poles try to pronounce leroy merlin ( that 's legit , very few people know how to pronounce it ), 
  general in poland - mr/mrs + [ surname ] if you are talking for the first time with important people , or when you want to be formal - mr/mrs + [ name ] if in casual/semi formal - just name when you are well acquainted using formal is always a good bet , if the other side is more laid back they will just tell you to call them by name, 
  i started appreciating lot of stuff after watching vblogs done by ukrainains in poland , but then again other countries also got that done even better / edit :  the lack of eastern european countries itt is very telling there 's very few ee redditors on this sub to begin with, 
  if you like castles , palaces , manoors etc look up these top 100 castles vids ( some of the pics are not up to date today , many of places got renovated , lists are in alphabetical order ) : - [ poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvpx_ewox98 ) ; smaller compilation vids : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8qs1zvyfce ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eggysqhimfe ) - [ france 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmqnkwoe6c ) , [ france2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5vugtnwaxu ) - [ belgium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uole1hupllw ) - [ netherlands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsmvcmdpefi ) - [ germany1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0_bv_gcdsq ) , [ germany2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1j1sm3qh0 ) - [ sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw4akoek0gi ) - [ dennmark/norway/finland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4iex--x9iq ) - [ swiss ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnz2if0pzr8 ) - [ austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h__fp1nfam ) - [ romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7emhwj8bw ) - [ hungary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyaztxdq5ts ) - [ slovakia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ebyg_7n2qs ) - [ czech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xblk4arsy_o ) each country has castles & palaces in europe , just search on youtube country + castles/palaces ( look them also in native languges ), 
  what 's your expirience of europe ? 
  it 's crucial to know what would be considered a `` hidden gem '', 
  i mean about wroc\u0142aw, 
  why is that ? 
  from my expirience there 's lot of religious people , but it 's only ok to be devoted if you are old , otherwise you will be to look at with pity , often lightly ostracised and laughet at . 
  most of the religiosity is just cultural habbits - you go to church on sundays or holidays , couse well the day is for that , you get married in church couse that 's how wedding supposed to look like etc. 
  very few people read bible or pray , most do n't even know basis tenants of faith, 
  maby not completley but quite true : - amount of drinking alcohol - it 's not what used to be , but still noticable for foreigners ( usualy couse they are not used drinking wodka in the way it 's drank here ) - lack of smiling , eye contact in everyday life , cold attitude towards strangers - women being beautiful - everyone has his taste , but women/girls got very high standard of caring about their looks on daily basis here, 
   what stereotype about your country ** is completely true **, 
  also to make one thing clear - its impact is acknowladged , but as a date it nearly does n't exist, 
   not many remember the exact dates of the paris attacks , brussels bombings , london bombings or madrid bombings , but every adult has 9/11 impressed in his memory . 
  becosue of what happened or becouse each year news show how americans memorize the day and internet ? 
  it would be either wroc\u0142aw , pozna\u0144 or 3city, 
  i 'm getting confused by it each year, 
  sorry to brust your bubble , but that 's how it 's seen outside us . 
  think about what was your reaction to things like the tsunami 2004 ( this probably got more coverage ) , earthquake in haiti , fokushima reactor failure , various terrorist attacks in eu , floods , mass fires etc - it 's how 9/11 is seen over the world , in many countries people probably forgot that it happened . 
  western countries remember it better mainly couse of americans rumbling about it each year, 
  just another accident/terrorist attack/natural disaster what you see is plane crushing into a skyscreapter - that 's pretty cool looking , you do n't see that everyday . 
  same as [ the explosion in tianjin , china ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0e5_1439474009 ) that happened last year - whoa that looks cool , ok move on in general the date is nowhere near recognisable as in us . 
  most people would need to think a bit to recognise the date , especially had it been written as dates are ( 9/11 does n't work , we use d/m/y or y/m/d system ) . 
  had i had to put my money i would say more people would just confuse the date with ww2 soviet invasion ( 17 sep. ) / edit : in post below i ' v written it in a better way : think about what was your reaction to things like the tsunami 2004 ( this probably got more coverage ) , earthquake in haiti , fokushima reactor failure or attack in school in beslan . 
  a big event that gets a long live feed and lot of sympathy gestures , but is not treated as something `` very close '' - the date does n't really bring any memories, 
  only cash i ' v got my wallet is 100usd bill i got left from a trip , over last ~ 3 years i only used cash to pay for my sport classes - everything else either debit card or bank transfer . 
  i even use my card for fast small purcheases like small water bottle, 
  i do n't get the fascination of unnatural butts in americas, 
  not often ( if at all ) . 
  looks and presentation skills are important here . 
  it 's mostly a job for girls - the word for the job has only femene form - pogodynka . 
  there are/were few guys like [ jaroslaw kret ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wow4ktlvlus ) or [ marek horczyczak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-njfra9sq4 ) , but they are exceptions [ there 's a playlist on yt with polish weather presenters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pluplbi_fow89b08jncy4uojryk2t8sjdp ) sometimes there are throwbacks to meteorology stations or hydrology institutions if something unusual happens, 
  [ exurb1a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucimiugdlbi6p17bdaczpvbg ) ( uk , english ), 
  / r/poland ( english one , works as askpoland where foreigners ask for stuff ) - i answer questions there pretty regularly / r/polska ( polish one ) - i mostly lurk around, 
  it 's a thing that has been reinforced since early day of polish state ( iirc there 's even some poem by polish/lithuanian noble from around xvii century with fragment that goes something around the lines `` as long as sun sets on west , poles will be bashing moscovite heads '' ) . 
  polish-russian relation were at best `` neutral '' ever since the x century ( best so far was probably during transformation up til somewhere aaround events in georgia , it looked as if the relations would become good just like with germany ) - first rus , later muscovy , russian empire , soviets , now ... 
  the sentiment lasts so long that it become part of `` being polish '' in some way . 
  russians on the other hand also are not so keen on working out the relation and like to trigger reactions at any opportunity it 's kind of reversed situation with what we got with hungary . 
  oh no the story is much , much longer . 
  the beef lasts nearly as long as the countries themselves - even before russia was a thing, 
  yes , the option depends on person though - i personally use exclusively 24 system to avoid confusion, 
  you got am/pm - rano/wieczorem ( in speach ), 
  no , look at my link of lalka and dziady , same case . 
  that 's how reddit 's formatting works, 
  put \\ after the letter l in novel for link to work, 
  both, 
  i dunno why his works are not covered in school, 
  pretty good method for bricks like that is `` cutting '' it into smaller pices ( like few chapters ) by kserocoping it ( or cutting physically if you want ) - this way you wo n't have mental wall coused by the book 's size, 
  the reason is actually pretty brutal - it comes from football hooligans back in the day [ short extract about that ] ( https://youtu.be/ll_gchosk4c?t=2m21s ), 
  i 'm not a fan of story books , i 'm prefer essey-type works . 
  polish authors like [ leszek ko\u0142akowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leszek_ko%c5%82akowski ) , [ czes\u0142aw mi\u0142osz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czes%c5%82aw_mi%c5%82osz ) or [ zbigniew herbert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zbigniew_herbert ) ( preferably about ethics or culture ) from school i liked polish poems ( need to start reading them again ) most , from books i think i enjoyed mickiewicz 's [ dziady ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dziady_ ( poem \\ ) ) and from story driven i liked boles\u0142aw prus ' [ lalka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_doll_ ( novel \\ ) ) most ( song about it by kaczmarski - [ `` the doll '' aka polish positivism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whxb5y349pq ) ) [ list of books from polish school ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4vtcca/what_books_are_typical_schoolassigned_reading_in/d62ohna ) ( most of titles considered classic in us are not even mentioned in our school , and nor in most of europe for that matter ), 
  with china we at least got good relations, 
  bicycle, 
  my family : - 3 cars ( one my fathers , my moms and one that i 'm sharing with my brother ) - 1 bike ( that has n't been used for around 3 years ) / edit : i do n't use the car that often - mostly driving back to parents for holidays . 
  i mostly use public transport on daily basis . 
  my brother on the other hand prefers to use the car . 
  we got easy access to a omega class boat in our befriended sailing club ( me with my brother made sailing patents there back in the day and my brother helps them each year with start/end of the season works and trained few kids groups on their camps ) . 
  you can easly rent kayaks here , not worth carrying it arround . 
  snowmobiles are not really a thing in poland - i do n't think i ever seen one here . 
  my dad has been considering to buy a jet ski for over a year now , but opinion of it not being worth the money prevails for now . 
  russia for anything from 1st world/other brics, 
  lol , wtf , bb , cu , cya , sry , hf , gn , sup , omg , brb are most common ones from my expirience, 
  - not religious - i do n't like most of most of traditional holliday foods ( i 'm pretty much starving during christmas eve and first day of easter ), 
  from my expirience there was a `` short '' time where many people used lot of various acronyms - when gadugadu was at its prime and before smartphones . 
  now pretty much all my friends use either full polish ( without polish signs , with the short versions of some words ) with english acronyms . 
  kind of light version of corpo speach, 
  never seen those ( in recent times ), 
  for internet mostly english ones are used , some polish ones : zw - zaraz wracam ( be right back ) kc - kocham cie ( i love you ) ocb - o co biega ( what 's going on ) nmzc - nie ma za co ( you 're welcome - in a sense that you helped someone , he says thx and you respond with this ) pzdr - pozdrawiam ( greetings ) np - na przyklad ( for example ) wgl - w og\u00f3le ( overall/never ) there was shit ton of those back when smss had limits and were expensive, 
  yea - usually during the clothes section or later during emphasis . 
  i do n't remember the rules though , i just go with my guts in polish we also got such order when it comes to adjctives, 
  you could - a group of ex-ussr ( russia , ukraine , belarus , caucasus and - stans ), 
  and australia with new zealand, 
  older ones : - whole gop ( around katowice ) region is considerd super polluted , people eat coal there and need to smoke like hell when they travel anywhere else couse they may get poisoned by the fresh air and in general bit dengerous - in krak\u00f3w it 's adviced to have machette for both selfdefence and cutting the air - sosnowiec is a meme for shitty town from more recent ones : - radom for being embodiment of `` polaki cebulaki '' ( = `` polish onionheads '' ) attributes ( ignorant , dumb , redneck etc ),
