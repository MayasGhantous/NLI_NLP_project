  eu = europe ftw, 
   atv quad  pwc skuter wodny ( water scooter ), 
   i 'd say to almost everyone in western europe in europe *  i believe that a lot of people there consider themselves european they do ? 
  they rather consider themselves `` russian '' ( aka ex ussr ), 
  lol why would n't they be ? 
  they are still in both europe ( which wo n't change ) and in eu, 
  i got so confused at first - why did you set up two such different regions , but then i remembered there 's also another galicia , in iberia, 
  in general private ones suck ( there are exceptions eg . 
  kozminski university in warsaw ) in a big simplification : there 's 3 tiers : - warsaw/krak \u00f3w - big cities ( gda\u0144sk , pozna\u0144 , wroc\u0142aw , bia\u0142ystok , katowice etc ) - small towns between 1st and 2nd group it 's very close , but krak\u00f3w-warsaw ( agh , uj , uw , pw , sgh ) got the extra capital of poland/history badge . 
  the third group is just like private ones considered to be degree machines, 
  landmass is what counts most though, 
  `` just three countries '' cover nealy 50 % of europe ... 
  funnily enough she has german/dutch roots . 
  she had pretty fucked up childhood ( like amny people from that times ) . 
  her father was german , mother russian-dutch they were sent to uzbekistan , where anna was born . 
  father got killed by commies , mother got married again with some polish military men , who later died in some battle . 
  mother used that marriage to be repatriated to poland after ww2 , and there anna grew up ( she was around 13 when she got to poland ) . 
  it was just after the war so she had to hide her german roots . 
  eventually she got known as polish singer ( she sung in polish and russian ) . 
  dunno what nationality she considered herself to be [ long trailer for tv series about her ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fel7od-ugem ) ; [ imbd ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2729414/ ) ( it 's worth to watch even only for the songs ), 
  not exactly collage can mean a step lower institution ( as you can not make master/doctorate there ) or just some department, 
  / / uni is free as standard , you pay if you suck / / there 's no such thing as college in poland , just university away from your city , often to the other side of the country ( warsaw is kind of exception ) . 
  many people ( especially girls ) prefer to be closer home , so that they can visit more often and it 's not matter of how wealthy you are ( if you are poor you get priority for dorms ) , but more of how good the uni is in my case ~ 350km,

  noone cares for one counterfeit item that has little tax on them like clothes also customs are only for things going into eu , not inside, 
  i find it really weird to call classical pieces `` songs '' , especially those where there 's no singing involved, 
  that 's not how it works, 
  come back to earth please gbp lost around 15 % to both euro and usd ( even pln ) over the year .

   will it try to strong-arm britain from formerly leaving the eu ? 
  imo it will rather be britain stalling for as long as possible  will e.u. 
  member states push for a more centralized and federalized e.u. ? 
  i guess so  is it possible places like ukraine could join e.u. 
  in the future ? 
  ukraine ? 
  not until crimea and eastern ukraine gets resolved , even then they would have to get all the benchmarks,

  if want to make further divisions i would say austria , hungary and czech as core and germany , poland , slovakia , swiss , slovenia in the wider circle ( but it 's totally arbitral , division for the sake of division ),

  a nice touch i would say how cool it is that he tries and switch to english ( unless he wants to speak in polish , but that never happens ), 
  generally we do n't few years ago some in neighbourhoods with kids people started trying to make it happen , but so far with pretty much no success - it 's pretty pointless when max 15 % of neighbours participate clubs got some themed parties from similar stuff we got [ andrzejki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._andrew%27s_day ) and [ carnival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnival#poland ) ( i got impression both are dying off ), 
  subs , dubbed only for cartoons ( they are pretty good in polish ), 
  before , for net it will be around 72 % of that you wo n't be making much money being a teacher . 
  those are base values, 
  from my expirience germanic : ( i ' v learned little german and swedish , but nowhere near fluent ) - i could n't say if it 's swedish dialect or norwegian from hearing , only alphabet gave it away . 
  from german-swedish i could only recognise some words or sentence structure . 
  they are close enough so that not having learnt eitehr fully nor used them in many years my mind melted it into one as for slavic : in general it 's doable inside the subgroups ( south-west-east ) if you got some expirience/get used o hearing it . 
  exposure is a big deal here - it can get easy if both sides got some kind of brige ( know what words to use - also there 's a huge mine field of words that sound similar or even same , but mean totally different things ) . 
  from reading/writing there 's the problem of latin vs cyrilic .
