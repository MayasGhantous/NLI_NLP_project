  there are some cool projects like [ interslavic language ] ( http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/ ) that got the core and mixed the languages making it pretty understandable for most people , pretty cool expirience they all got the same root and to some extent some language pairs can understand each other . 
  [ this map ] ( https://elms.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/lexicaldistanceielangs.jpg ) should give you an idea . 
  when talking about simple things i can have a basic slow talk with czechs/slovaks/ukrainians / belarusians . 
  if you hear someone sayng that knowing one you will understand others , it 's very overrated , pretty much bullshit - even languages that are close often prefer to just switch to english some more or less rating ( from simple phrases and news segments ) : czech - ~ 60 % slovak - ~ 60 % ukrainian - ~ 50-60 % ( depends how much russicisms one use ) belarusian - ~ 40 % -50 % ( depends how much russicisms one use ) serbo-croatian - ~ 45 % slovenian - 20 % ( sounds like italian , i can get only single words , ~ 30 % in writting though ) macedonian/bulgarian - 20 % ( pretty hard to make anything from it ) russian - - ~ 20-30 % [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/50tb89/slavic_europeans_what_is_the_relationshipbond/ ) from 2 days ago was in part about mutual intelligibility of slavic languages, 
  possition | start | median or with expirience : -- | : -- | : -- school teacher ( with master degree and pedagogical training ) | 518.55 | 711.78 university assistant | 470.48 | 572.36 university professor | 1 035.97 | 1 259.19 for university it 's median , for school it 's highest base after promotions made into euro , for comparison : - poland 's average/median ( in euro ) : 982,59 / 753,58 - minimal wage ( in euro ) : 423.54 sources : [ 2015/2016 school teachers earnings ] ( https://www.portaloswiatowy.pl/zmiany-w-prawie-oswiatowym/wynagrodzenie-nauczycieli-w-roku-szkolnym-20152016-5294.html ) and [ 2013 bankier : how much do academic teacher make ? 
  ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/ile-zarabia-nauczyciel-akademicki-2968325.html ) treatment depends on the school and the teacher . 
  in general you got pretty formal relations , you always say mr/mrs or by mr/mrs + degree ( only engineer , doctor and higher ) . 
  in highschool and junior highschool you say mr/mrs professor regardless of degree, 
   having countries that are very similar culturally kind of forming a union ( perhaps similar to the uk ? 
  or perhaps simply just a deal like the v4 ) . 
  they got such thing : [ nordic cuncil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council ), 
  polan had its time of imp [ erialism though , finland did n't, 
  lets go full crazy - ditch the shitty south and hold hands with slovenes and croats, 
  two options : 1 . 
  polish-ukrainian , ukraine breakes ( something like [ zhirinovsky 's * magic ] ( http://s.tvp.pl/images2/0/b/6/uid_0b628ce11a1d930f4cb7ebacc49ea9e41395641009565_width_633_play_0_pos_0_gs_0_height_355.jpg ) ) , western part joins poland fully or in some form 2 . something eu related - stronger integration leads to creation of a country . 
  not necessarily whole eu ( i 'm specific as fuck ) / edit : to use `` all 3 '' borders let 's add 3rd option : \u0141ukaszenko dies ( unless he becomes immortal by the time  ) and belarus switches its orientation to west ( and changes their ugly ssr flag back to [ white-red-white ] ( http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/htb1q35hivxxxxcbaxxxq6xxfxxxo/free-shipping-pagonya-flag-90x150cm-polyester-belarusian-flag-of-belarus-country-flags-and-banners-for-home.jpg_640x640.jpg ) , they could incorporate the folk ornament into it though as it 's unique and cool ; about the flag i 'm dead serious - they should change it ) aka poland - unlike ukraine i would n't expect them to want to join the country , but rather enter eu-like relations added pictures , couse everything is better with pictures * zhirinovsky is russian `` politician '' that runs around and spreads dumb ideas like invading finland , sending invitations to countries to partition ukraine etc. 
  ( [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_zhirinovsky#foreign_relations_and_military_excursions ) has more of those  ) he 's called putin 's court jester obviously all taken out of my ass for fun, 
  hard to say comics are not really popular in general in poland european ones ( like asterix or tytus , romek & a'tomek , kozio\u0142ek mato\u0142ek , kapitan \u017bbik ) were a bit popular in poland in around ' 70 - ' 90 . 
  as for japanese manga - it 's rather small groups of weebos , anime is far more popular than comics . 
  as for american ones i never heard/seen anyone reading them , reading through comments - donald duck was pretty known, 
  hmm there was very similar thread not so long ago , i will find it in a lil got it : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/50h57n/what_according_to_you_was_the_most_annoying_false/ my copy paste : from common ones regarding poland : - we were part of soviet union - `` polish death camps '' - we speak russian - our history starts after ww1/2 from ones regarding europe : - socialist states - this always grind my gears - eu is a country - european caliphate - everyone speaks english ( or russian for eastern countries ) - as for that - using cold war division , especially when talking about global/whole europe politics ), 
  yes [ articles from / r/europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=mafia&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on ) there was some in detail post some time ago , but i can not find it now this thread has bit more info - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xtgnu/italy_puts_more_than_140_on_trial_for_mafia_links/ [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organized_crime_in_italy ), 
  traditionally child gets father 's last name ( so does women after marrige ) , but that 's not forced . 
  names just like in russian change depending on gender eg . 
  jankowski ( m ) jankowska ( f ) ( there 's also variants for married/unmarried/daughter eg . 
  father/son nowak , wife nowakowa , unmarried daughter nowak\u00f3wna and family as a whole nowakowie , but they are not often used ) foreign names usually stay as they are , they do n't get polonised . 
  i 'm not sure about foreign letters though - i think they may be simplified eg instead of \u0117 there will be e. 
  not visiting , but after watching some travel videos/vblogs belarus - i always imagined it as rundown , post ussr shithole like the - stans countries . 
  turns out it 's very neat , clean country . 
  i 'm considering making a trip there next summer, 
  depends what 's the goal behind the structure - if the goal is to sort by importance , then yes it 's true . 
  the thing is it 's not necessary for the articles to be sorted this way, 
  couse it 's irrevelant . 
  just a structural planing thing - the consitution bullet points do n't have to go by what is most important , there are multiple way you can logically organise the articles, 
   it 's been completely wiped of the map twice in its history . 
  that 's not entirely accurate . 
  it 's pretty complicated eg . 
  there were few poish states between partitions and ww1 , also during ww2 poland stil had active state . 
  you would also have to define what you mean by `` country '' and if you include system changes ( monarchy to republic or communism to capitalist ) if you want most recent one they it would be the countries that took part in after ww2 conferences . 
  if you include system changes ( eg . 
  from polish people 's republic to republic of poland ) then everyone i guess - i do n't think there was a country that did n't recognise that . 
  we are simply in the `` it 's complicated '' group that had dozen of renderings over the years . 
  your question simply does n't work for many countries / edit : also another thing - keep in mind that country , state and nation are not the same thing ( they often align though ), 
  it 's also pretty weird question as many of european countries just `` were '' there also important one - when . 
  there were times when there was no polish state official polish state starts in 966 when polish ruler [ mieszko i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianization_of_poland ) got baptised and married bohemian princess so you could say it was holy roman empire , czech bohemia or christian states in general . 
  it 's still more of joining a political club of `` legit , civilised countries '', 
  never thought about defining it `` common good '' something inbetween i guess - it 's something that everyone owns and everyone is supposed to take care of . 
  since the republic has no physical form and it 's goal is wellbeing of it 's citizens it creates a feedback loop making it both a property and a morall good, 
  europe 5 . 
  western world, 
  you may be interessed then in [ this travel vblog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl92ywc80dejd4gegokft7fqej3fw5f9wh ) - hitch-hiking trip from wroc\u0142aw , poland to magadan , far east russia [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hurjkotpu ) . 
  not all episodes got english subs though, 
  http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm ( whole constitution in english )  chapter i  the republic  article 1  the republic of poland shall be the common good of all its citizens . 
  and before that :  having regard for the existence and future of our homeland ,  which recovered , in 1989 , the possibility of a sovereign and democratic determination of its fate ,  we , the polish nation - all citizens of the republic ,  both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty ,  as well as those not sharing such faith but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources ,  equal in rights and obligations towards the common good - poland ,  beholden to our ancestors for their labours , their struggle for independence achieved at great sacrifice , for our culture rooted in the christian heritage of the nation and in universal human values ,  recalling the best traditions of the first and the second republic ,  obliged to bequeath to future generations all that is valuable from our over one thousand years ' heritage ,  bound in community with our compatriots dispersed throughout the world ,  aware of the need for cooperation with all countries for the good of the human family ,  mindful of the bitter experiences of the times when fundamental freedoms and human rights were violated in our homeland ,  desiring to guarantee the rights of the citizens for all time , and to ensure diligence and efficiency in the work of public bodies ,  recognizing our responsibility before god or our own consciences ,  hereby establish this constitution of the republic of poland as the basic law for the state , based on respect for freedom and justice , cooperation between the public powers , social dialogue as well as on the principle of subsidiarity in the strengthening the powers of citizens and their communities . 
   we call upon all those who will apply this constitution for the good of the third republic to do so paying respect to the inherent dignity of the person , his or her right to freedom , the obligation of solidarity with others , and respect for these principles as the unshakeable foundation of the republic of poland . 
   is veganism `` popular '' ? 
  nope . 
  it 's in `` hipster bullshit '' category . 
  there are some vegan bars in big cities . 
   animal shelters ? 
  each town has at least one i believe . 
  dunno how they look in other countries , but here they are overpacked and underfunded  is animal abuse taken seriously ? 
  we got an act on the protection of animals in polish law that regulates how you can transport , kill , use for entertainment and protection of animals you can be fined or even imprisoned for animal cruelty ( 3 years ) , animals can be taken from you if you do n't take care of them when it comes to science stuff ( medical , pharmaceutics etc ) you can use animals only if there 's no other alternative . 
  in general over recent years treatement of animals ( mostly circus , farm and pets ) got lot of spotlight here and quite a lot have changed with people 's attitude, 
  that 's the most standard definition - social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, 
  economic one - opposing to capitalism, 
  keep in mind that 's only half meaning of socialism , i do n't think you would like to associate yourself with the other part, 
  i do n't believe it 's true for swiss, 
  it 's mostly russian thing , does n't really apply to other countries, 
  tbh western slavic countries are probably closer culturally to germany than to russia, 
   how deep of a connection do slavs feel between each other ? 
  not much . 
   what is it that connects you as slavs ? 
  the criterium it 's based on - language . 
  they all got the same root and to some extent some language pairs can understand each other . 
  [ this map ] ( https://elms.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/lexicaldistanceielangs.jpg ) should give you an idea . 
  when talking about simple things i can have a basic slow talk with czechs/slovaks/ukrainians / belarusians . 
  if you hear someone sayng that knowing one you will understand others , it 's very overrated , pretty much bullshit - even languages that are close often prefer to just switch to english another one is history related - all of slavic countries expirienced communism in some way . 
  from cultural things - steorotype that strong alcohols are pretty popular . 
  hearing that someone is from another slavic country you by steorotype expect them to like the alcohols  language already mentioned  is there a lot of ( cultural ) exchange happening between the countries ? 
  there was during communism ( example of that is polish witcher series or scifi stuff by stanis\u0142aw lem ) , now it 's rather confined to close neighbours - czechs and slovaks , belarus & russia ( belarusians emigrating to russia ) , ukriane & russia and ukraine & poland ( ukrainians emigrating to either russia or poland ) , dunno how it looks between southern slavic countries  is there anything pan-slavic going on ? 
  not really . 
  it got very bad name due to being tied with russian imperialism, 
   young adults  in high school top kek , just teens, 
  they should definitly do this like for 1st april or something, 
  almost as the little dog  it 's also considered a `` girly drink '' here that nearly replaced beer with syrup and straw, 
  in poland we get many teenagers trips that go for auschwitz/krak \u00f3w 's old jewish district . 
  they often go with an `` they hate jews there , they will talk shit on you and if they could they would kill you '' attitude and are also pretty rude/pretentious, 
  it 's also predominantly called `` radler '' ( or a dimuitive form to be exact - `` radlerek '' ) in poland, 
  well this is reddit, 
  `` russian then '' ? 
  meanwhile in australia they should wear dirndls and start yodeling at their airports . 
  polish death camps i guess, 
  just serbian then ? 
  becouse people buy them , 
  it 's super exam heavy and memorize - write the exam - forget i got pretty lucky with my schools , couse it did outside curriculum stuff, 
  they do n't seem to be active in academic circles . 
  i found few articles , but it seems to be quite small , underground thing, 
  it stuck couse it perfectly embodies [ how we hear czech lang ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b3e3v5f.png ), 
  couse [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) is what both nations are taught since kids days,
