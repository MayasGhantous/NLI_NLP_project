  i do n't get it, 
  it 's in ppp , thsoe are first google results from pictures ok found it [ it 's from reddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/32bo6t/median_income_per_capita_in_europe_ppp_adjusted_oc/ ) which in turn has data from [ gallup ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/166211/worldwide-median-household-income-000.aspx ), 
  [ other threads about it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/search?q=stereotype&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ), 
   education pretty good , will be cheap for you ( i assume you are not eligible for polish citizenship/pole 's card ) . 
  university are not rich and got problems with patents which are super expensive  quality of life one of safest countries in the world , low crime rate , aside from few cities low pollution , very green , has nearly everything - forests , lakes , rivers , sea , mountains , good public transport  cost of living http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=poland, 
  from common ones regarding poland : - we were part of soviet union - `` polish death camps '' - we speak russian - our history starts after ww1 from ones regarding europe : - socialist states - this always grind my gears - eu is a country - european caliphate - everyone speaks english ( or russian for eastern countries ) - as for that - using cold war division , especially when talking about global/whole europe politics ), 
  in terms of stats - [ gdp per capita in ppp ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita_in_2015.svg/863px-countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita_in_2015.svg.png ) - [ hdi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) - [ median income ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hbc9gsx.jpg ) is there anything in particular you are looking for ? 
  quite popular , i do n't think it 's as popular as rock or pop related genres [ few tracks from another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4yzmge/any_good_rap_coming_out_of_europe_lately/d6rogts ), 
   eat mostly chicken , pork and beef , fish from time to time  have you ever killed an animal that you usually eat ? 
  nope . 
  closest i got was watching my grandfather beheading a chicken when i was around 5yo, 
  reddit is wastly-american site it 's impossible to get aways from it, 
  so in thread when americans ask for it or say something wrong ? 
  you just prove my point, 
  imo you are just super biased . 
  pretty much only time i see europeans lecuring on reddit is when americans spread bullshit about how something works in europe, 
  your premise is wrong imo, 
  same in poland you just say how many living/bedrooms there are never seen the half , but i would assume it 's flat without a separeded kitchen mayby, 
   for tests we could use either , as long as we were consistent and not mix them . 
  not even that from my expirience , it was just said both are correct, 
  for eastern europe ( belarus , russia and ukraine ) it 's russian for ex warsaw pact countries that joined the eu it 's english , to much smaller extent german, 
  small thing  why is the german flag black , red and ~ ~ yellow ~ ~ gold, 
  you are just asking for raw facts though, 
  it 's a short trip to wiki , why to make a thread out of it, 
   how popular are grappling sports ( judo , jiu-jitsu , wrestling , etc ) among european youth ? 
  there 's at least one club in each city , from most popular would be mma , krav maga and judo i guess . 
  wrestling is pretty much dead  are they practiced in schools like they are in the usa ? 
  sports in general are not practised in schools , but in clubs . 
  athletics may be an exception here or some teacher may be having some group after classes , but still if you want to get competitive you usually need to join some club, 
  - you do n't need credit history just like in us ( simply working is usually enough ) - free education - people still prefer to buy flats/homes and it 's still possible to get something with parents ' help in good location - you can go abroad to make some money and benefit from diffrency in purchasing power between the currencies tbh it 's quite good / edit : biggest problem is finding decently paid job outside medicine/programming, 
  the disco thing they got on radio is horrible though, 
  we just got history classes , mayby one lesson ( 45min ) is devoted solely to us ( with focus of polish accents - pu\u0142awski and ko\u015bciuszko ) , a bit when talking about big expeditions and small mentions during ww1 and ww2, 
  irish and spanish fans in general during euro, 
  so-so . 
  they used to have really bad reputation ( bribe or i will find something to fine you for ; kind of like you now have in russia or ukraine ) , but over years it fixed most those issues . 
  it still can happen , but it 's rare compared to what used to be . 
  there 's also group of people mentally frozen in time who still think of the police as if it was communist militia . 
  stats from q3 2014 [ source in polish ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2014/k_068_14.pdf ) : - trust in police went from 62/30/8 in 2002 ( trust/not/dunno ) to 71/21/8 [ fast translated table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v9r6t7y.png ) ( lol my spelling is bad ), 
   do you believe in one or more god ( s ) ? 
  non  are you a member of a religious society ? 
  ( church of england , folkekirken , etc. ), 
  catholic church , but passively ( just for holidays when i 'm at my parents or weddings/funerals )  do you ever say a prayer , meditate , etc ? 
  no  whether or not you go to a church/mosque/temple etc. 
  or not , do you perceive yourself as ... not believing  what is your general perception of religion ? 
  i 'm ok with it when people just go to church or pray . 
  it start to be a problem when they treat it seriously and cross the border when they start to enfore it on others, 
  in poland our `` dictator '' [ j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_pi%c5%82sudski ) is seen as national hero . 
  he did some bad things , but in general it 's the good type of dictator - established poland back on the map , saved from soviets and was not consumed by power, 
   do you feel like you 're a citizen of europe rather than just a citizen of germany , italy , france , poland etc ? 
  not `` rather '' , but `` also '' - poland first , europe second  how do you think the people around you in your life , at work , on the streets etc. 
  feel about a european identity ? 
  on daily basis not realy , but that changes really fast when put in foreign enviroment , especially outside western world, 
  in general the more south-east and east you go the more hospitable people are, 
  may not be exactly best , but those are 3 i like most : - [ jak rozp\u0119ta\u0142em drug\u0105 wojn\u0119 \u015bwiatow\u0105 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065908/ ) ( = `` how i started ww2 '' , comedy following polish soldiers adventures throughout war fronts ) , yt link with english subs : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b928wek_qwk ) ( there are 3 parts ) ; it 's the movie from which [ this known scene comes from ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ) - [ seksmisja ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088083/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) ( comedy , 2 guys take part in hibernation experiment , get woken up in post ww3 world where there are only females ) , can not find version with subs - [ dzie\u0144 \u015bwira ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330243/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) ( = `` day of the wacko '' ; drama - an episode from frustrated divorced teacher who stays in the vicious circle of his numerous obsessions ; type of movie after which you get really depressed ) ; yt link with english subs : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmqqpey96r4 ) - [ sami swoi ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062228/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) ( comedy , polish movie gem , may be hard to appriciate it couse most of the commedy comes from language ; two quarreling peasant families , who were forced to leave their lands after the war , are settled by accident on two neighbouring farms .

   i 've never heard of the last two and i am european , so no vote from me . 
  pretty weird way to go about this . 
  you just look in general face direction , looking in eyes is sure way to make people feel uncomfortable, 
  looking people in the eyes is weird, 
   plus , not looking the other person in the eyes while shaking their hand what the fuck ? 
  how could i never heard that, 
  one of the songs that just grows on you each time you hear it, 
  here it would rather be sign of immaturity or mental problems . 
  you are supposed to show signal by coming prepared to the interview ( know the company , have skills etc ) and ask relevant questions, 
  corpos aside as they are same everywhere  are they usually one to one or in groups ? 
  depends on company  does what you wear matter ? 
  yes , depends on possition , but generally formal , suit & tie  are you expected to act ( overly ) enthusiastic ? 
  rather toned down , appropriate for the possition  does it mainly consist of you answering questions or do you have to show off your skills ? 
  also dependson possition and company  are personal questions allowed ? 
  yes , but frowned upon  do you personally find them easy or difficult ? 
  i just find them annoying due to the standard dumb no-questions like `` how do you see yourself in x years '' and conected to this - motivational letter . 
  i 'm so angry t it - cv contains the relevant info and the letter is just set of useless fluff that hr people even often admit not to read at all , but hell , it 's nearly always required, 
  many foreigners get weirded out by that . 
  it 's not as popular like it used to be due to all the new beer-like products , but it 's still one of traditional summer things, 
  dead hands are worst , instantly makes you want punch the guy in the face, 
  not that but in poland we got `` girly beer '' where you add some fruit syrup into the beer and drink it via straw like [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/21/61/28/216128843dbd25b4b116a1bd682d7aa7.jpg ), 
  we often got tiles , but we also often have floor heating then, 
  there 's no title like that you would say `` chrzestni anni '' ( = anna 's godparents ) or just by their `` standard ' relation to you - brother , friend , in-law etc, 
  ~ 3years ago my professor from banking mentioned as trivia that it 's one of weird things bank in poland has to do ( if they do n't have it they will just have to order it and send it to you ) , but it 's not used to the point that noone , often including the bank workers got idea about . 
  mayby they changed it, 
  or poland , plus even if it 's a good news you need to nitpick something bad from it, 
  and at that ( at least in poland ) - if you are the one filling the drinks , you fill your as last, 
  milk in tea is heresy,

  [ kazanecki 's night & days ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esuqpwjdbvg ) or [ killar 's promised land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haokgwswd2q ) to cartoons like [ once upon a december from anastasia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quz-smivmbs ) - they all scream europe - classical music in general for `` america , fuck yeah '' type i would pick : - [ i 'm european ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sora5nq17g8 ) or - [ globus - europa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aitid1kixm4 ), 
   windows [ this kind of windows ] ( http://www.crlaurence.com/adv/us-aluminum/images/series-iw8000.png ) ( dunno how they are called , they open up ) . 
  here [ standard windows you can see here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt8ebjlct8s ) ( but usually while , at least in poland ) with mutiple opening modes [ pic ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bf1hf )  payment direct transfer to your bank account , and usually you are paid per month . 
  cheques stop being used here somewhere around interwar . 
  technically each bank should be able to give you a cheque book if you ask , but in reality they would probably just stare at you like some weird person . 
  i would be pretty hard to find someone who ever seen a cheque aside from tv quizes . 
   is that bad/backwards to people ? 
  it 's just super weird in this era, 
  no , many houses are built very cheaply with chipboards as walls instead of bricks . 
  worse : - public transport - cardboard houses - weird house windows - ugly in window ac ( my dad has a ac/ventilation company and he was in shock what sutff even seemingly wealthy americans got ) - tacky stuff in gardens - internet/phone - banking ( i mean simple everyday finencial stuff - like paychecks , wtf is it xviii century ? 
  or bank transfers , credit/debet cards ) - super fat/sugar/salt foods / tasteless veggies or fruits better : - encouraging entreneurship ( there 's a small drawing that i can not find atm comparing poland vs us with small girl selling lemonade : us - oh how cute , i will take two please ; poland - oh unregistered economic activity , no osh , it will be 5.000 pln fine ) - movies/tv, 
  do you also make an annoying scene just like with refusing a gift ? 
   - wait i will only take down my schoes  - oh , there is no need , come in  - no wait i 'm taking them down  - there 's really no need  - so i will fetch you some slippers  - no , thx it 's fine  - i 'm getting them  - i 'm really ok , there 's no need  - ok here you are  - thx , but really there was no need,
