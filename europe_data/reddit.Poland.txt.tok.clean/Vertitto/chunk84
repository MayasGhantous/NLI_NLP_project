  x = chrzestna y = no word z = chrzestni so : godmother - ( matka ) chrzestna godfather - ( ojciec ) chrzestny godparents - ( rodzice ) chrzestni godson - chrze\u015bniak godddaughter - chrze\u015bnica godchildren - chrze\u015bniaki the word derives from `` chrzest '' which means `` baptism '', 
  also at that i feel american swearig is n't that colorful nor beefy and it 's not that intimidating/scarry . 
  it 's not a matter of english - british does n't have that problem, 
   the ww2 invasion of czechia however . . i would n't count that as ashamed compared to two mentioned - that conflict has some background . 
  it 's a tiny , barely visible on map region that has been point of contention for quite some time . 
  just after the ww1 it changed hands multiple times - kind of like small kids ' toy , where one kids takes it as soon as other turns his head away, 
  in poland it used to be that patriotism is the good one and nationalism is borderline bad , but recently nationalism started to eat out patriotism . 
  few national symbols got bad connotations thanks to the new nationalists , but in general things like flags or patriotic songs are viewed very positively,

   also , does prestige of a college matter in undergrad , if i wish to go to grad-school ? 
  not all european systems do n't work this way . 
  it 's usually just `` university '' . 
  on polish example : there 's no such thing as collage - you go to one of univeristy types : - university ( general one : linguistics , philosophy , math , physics , history , law , bilogy , chemistry , finances , economy ; mostly theritical ) , - politechnics ( for hard sciences , various types of engineering , it etc , aside from theoritical it 's also focuses on `` building stuff '' ) , - medical - music academy - military academy - other specialistic academys eg . 
  neval or flight and not all disciplines are two-step  which schools ( or countries ) should i be looking at ? 
  depends what you are looking for , what 's you budged , where you want to live , languge  i realize that i may not be too competitive for uk schools , but would i do better in the netherlands ? 
  depends more on schools or lectures themselves than on country, 
  search for some part time job in some accountancy firm ( it should n't be that hard as they often got ton of work ) and see if it 's a job for you - many people quit fast couse it 's really boring and repetitive job,

  ah indeed , i took that from some outdated forum, 
  i wonder how would polish cities look like had not for the nearly lethal destruction during the deluge and ww2, 
  my copy-paste from / r/europe : i do n't think there 's any . 
  you can not however hold your phone and talk/sms while driving - that costs ~ ~ 500 ~ ~ 200 pln + 5penalty points . 
  having it on the phone holder for gps or talking on speaker is ok, 
  i ask couse hungary is a fencing powerhouse, 
  it 's not that caring about social justice is seen as wrong or abhorrent , but what sjw are doing has nothing to do with caring about social justice, 
  it 's more of rednecks of progressives, 
  it 's the living meme of absurd and hypocrisy , worst side of modern left side , a laughing stock and a go-to example for failed society, 
   he was a briliant man and a good politician i was taught the exact opposite i always heard about him as being a `` yes man '' , catherine 's puppet , an incompetent ruler , who tried to do some good , but too late, 
  from big ones taking part in [ warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) from smaller ones : treatment of ukrainians in volhynia ( which later on backfired heavily ), 
   poniatowski in my school he was usually described from negative side ( as catherine 's puppet ) as a start with some arguments leaning to possitives to balance it out a bit,

  and again trying to hijack our marie sk\u0142odowska . 
  at least chopin is not there , 
  yea pretty big upset, 
  matches with poland give really fun fan expirience as there 's lot of singing , examples : - [ zawsze tam gdzie ty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sg1xdqo6c4 ) - [ ko\u0142ysanka dla nieznajomej ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuj-e8vjmwm ) - [ ta\u0144czymy labada ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt3o8zgv7kw ) - [ harlem shake weaves ] ( https://youtu.be/ti9d4kicqoq?t=18s ) - [ fans shoots from poland-usa match ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hszyyddmgq8 ) - [ short fan compilation vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbk9y8w5ube ), 
  from big figues that come to my mind atm : - ~ ~ [ stanis\u0142aw august poniatowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis%c5%82aw_august_poniatowski ) ( last kind of plc ) is often considered to be one . 
  he 's also given some slack due to the situation he was in and attempts to fix things ~ ~ ok , he does n't fit with others mentioned - suporters of [ targowica confederation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/targowica_confederation ) - [ radziwi\u0142\u0142 family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radziwi%c5%82%c5%82 ) ( wealthiest lithuanian magnate family ) due to [ agreement of k\u0117dainiai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k%c4%97dainiai ) ( taking swedish side during the deluge ) - in general communist leaders, 
  fencing ? 
  most people do n't know the difference between stock and bonds and do n't even have a slightest idea of what the stock exchange is - even wealthy people . 
  most popular form of investing is imo buying a flat for rent or land, 
  very rare , rather old fashioned , informal `` hello '', 
  football -- long pause ---------- volleyball * , handball mayby ski jumps or athletics * we are probably only nation that can fill [ whole football stadium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpwz-hbpk_e ) for a volleyball match ( opening match of volleyball men 's world championship 2014 ) . 
  plus as bonus song that become our `` volleyball hymn '' [ pie\u015b\u0144 o ma\u0142ym rycerzu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxvl-i8pyva ),

  in case of finland & baltics it 's was more of having an ally to help vs soviets . 
  so i guess they go about it from this angle, 
  too add to what others said - while taking a trip around europe you usually do n't take car - you use trains , buses or planes, 
  i usually do n't bother to do that at all ( for fruits , i wash most veggies though as they tend to have dirt ) or just wipe it ( eg apple ) with my shirt . 
  generally running tap water is used using soap would definitly freak out people, 
  for baltics & poland it would certainly be worrying , paranoia would go up by few gears, 
  just standard polish . 
  there 's not much of live dialects in use any more anyway . 
  few examples : - [ highlinder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kerb9erjjs ) ( mountain people ) - [ silesian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyfhotedhek ) ( mix of polish and german ) - [ kashubian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqepuygkz0a ) ( kashubian nad silesian are sometimes classified as separate languages ) ( northen poland ) ; example on song [ original , standard polish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdcne0wbl4e ) and [ in kashubian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdcne0wbl4e ) - [ kurpian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyj0h4f2csg ) ( from [ here ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jkataxn5yfi/vi1wkz0mo2i/aaaaaaaauy0/qw9idjknr6e/s1600/bez%c2%a0tytu%c5%82u3.png ) ) - [ polish from kresy ( today 's ukraine ) ] ( https://youtu.be/vcpym42vmo0?t=17m24s ) ( i think ) , [ another example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sutwaqs3ddy ) - [ wielkoposka ( around pozna\u0144 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvfqp3wf8x4 ) - [ from around vilnius ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhctf3sxnra ) standard example : [ documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-pzntg4puc ) or [ news ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oeelip6tpi ) dialects are now pretty much a turist attraction , thing for regional culture centers or for fun at parties . 
  you pretty much wo n't hear them on every day in cities also for fun : [ polish with foreign accents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eydhe4lgg80 ), 
  or gypsies, 
   would like to avoid rain in november ? 
  that may be hard anywhere go to [ 3city ] ( http://guide.trojmiasto.pl/ ) , weather depends on what kind of autumn we will have, 
   russians that greet people by kissing them on the lips really ? 
  oo you got something wrong, 
  that depends - do you wear socks with sandals ? 
  i dunno what kind of `` worst '' op is looking for - `` so bad it 's great '' or `` so bad i do n't want to see it '', 
  there 's no sandwich thing like in us where they all got names and everything - it 's just bread , butter and some topping , usually open eg . 
  with ham , cheese and tomato, 
  it does n't just sound annoying - it is for both sides of transaction, 
  and pork , and sauerkraut, 
  i 'm not fan of this kind of music , but here 's few classic polish tracks : - [ paktofonika - jestem bogiem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq2pabclssc ) ( probably polish top rated hiphop/rap song ever , legend of polish scene , [ movie has been made about the main rapper ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209386/ ) ) - [ fisz - czerwona sukienka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bywcb1ftrhu ) - [ paktofonika - priorytety ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qomcjdm8cro ) - [ kaliber 44 - normalnie o tej porze ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9njt9tlyvuy ) - [ 52 d\u0119biec feat . 
  ascetoholix - to my polacy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcqdjyo1b-8 ) - [ ascetoholix - suczki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnjokhj_sy ) - [ karramba - poca\u0142uj mnie w dupe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rnjosyuaqo ) - [ peja - g\u0142ucha noc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amejvccfnmm ) some bestof compilations : - [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi0ohyjonum ) - [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds0zxwwxoik ) ( 2 got taken down ) ( rap or hiphop - i can not tell the difference ), 
  land of socks and sandals, 
  you mean [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5yohqztla ), 
   i also do n't understand why some germans wear socks with sandals not only germans it 's a feature of the whole region - germany , poland , austria , czech [ polish turist meme ] ( http://i1.kwejk.pl/k/obrazki/2013/04/87733c6b368ff99dbbfdc0b9889f6d19_original.jpg ), 
  first : belarus direct neighbour , country very close culturally with which we got nearly no relations second : russia one of the biggest treading partner , very culturally & economically influential , but acts like butthurt imperialist asshole, 
  that sounds like one of the songs from the cringy weekend morning kids shows, 
  it 's pretty cool , a product of its time, 
  [ polish entries from '94 to ' 14 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zykwraumwew ) you would vote for [ ' 07 , the jet set - time to party ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jkp7oq1xb8 ) or [ ' 01 , piasek - too long ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zguvo2w44yo ) as worst ones [ '94 ( a. g\u00f3rniak ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl5rmmpihp8 ) and [ '97 ( a.m. jopek ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpbmyjnclru ) were best ones imo, 
  i expected you mean as a trip , not as `` standard ''  are polish citizens allowed to driver cars with a german license plate in poland ? 
  ofc as long as you driving license & insurence is valid . 
  it will problematic if you do it as a company , but as a individual ? 
  especially if it 's temporary - no problem, 
  if you got passport of any eu * country you can go wherever you want in eu as if it was one country * schengen is more accure, 
  there are some , but it 's / r/askeurope after all , not many people in general, 
  not so special after all : ), 
  it 's known as one of the most important battle in europe 's history , how more higher rated it can get ? 
  it 's known as one of most important battles of europe already, 
  in what way is it underrated though ? 
  french , russian , german , czech , finnish , swedish and many more it 's strange it 's not a thing in italy, 
  dunno what 's weird about it . 
  it 's pretty normal dish in poalnd, 
  i do n't exactly know how the things are taugh ( if at all ) in other countries , but from polish side it would be : - expellation of polish-lithuianian army from moscov , that ends dimitriads ( or as russian know it - [ time of troubles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time_of_troubles ) ) , start of romanov dynasty that kickstarted russia to be a big imperium - [ polish-soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) and it 's culmination point - [ battle of warsaw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_ ( 1920 \\ ) ) - first weave of communism could have reached quite far westwards early on, 
  steorotypical pinncle of which is montenegro, 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/migration_and_migrant_population_statistics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_europe, 
  not a communist dictatorship though, 
   communist dictatorships ? 
  if you want to see clean cities look up belarus , no other country can compete in this department with them, 
  there 's no such thing in poland , closest thing would be `` ko\u0142a naukowe '' - student organisation who work around some specific problems in their studying field, 
  it 's sung poetry with classical guitar ( sometimes piano ) accompaniment . 
  his songs touch different topic : political , social or history commentary , various literary works , paintings or comedy .
