  tone ranges from sad , melancholic , to joyful or aggressive . 
  songs are often very easy to hum along , so even if you do n't understand the lyrics ( sadly missing out on a ton ) it 's cool to listen some of my favs : - songs describing paintings by p. bruegl : [ przepowiednia jana chrzciciela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zieutglt67s ) ( = die predigt johannes des t\u00e4ufers ) ; [ upadek ikara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4l49lnd5bq ) ( = landscape with the fall of icarus ) or [ przypowie\u015b\u0107 o \u015blepcach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nup_8zc3apm ) ( = the blind leading the blind ) - painting by e.munch [ krzyk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzai0wqrb5y ) ( = scream ) - [ \u015aniadanie z bogiem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el7nz28ylpo ) ( = breakfast with god ; where he describes his god , who is his personality and his relation with him ) - [ lot ikara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6dthuwgpbi ) ( = flight of icarus ) - [ po\u017cegnanie okud\u017cawy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4pon0czet0 ) ( = farewell to [ bulat okudzhava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulat_okudzhava ) ) - [ przypowie\u015b\u0107 na w\u0142asne 44 urodziny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck5d1qe4-5e ) ( = parable for own 44th birthday ; where under form of a cat observes different humane archetypes ) - [ epitafium dla wlodzimierza wysockiego ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumyd5c59wy ) ( = epitaph for [ vladimir vysotsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_vysotsky ) ; dante 's inferno - like jurney through circles of hell , but instead of hell it 's communism or society under it ) - [ zrodlo wszelkiego zla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l7gjw4s-2c ) ( = source of all evil ; each stanza is critising some big religious denomination : atheism , protestantism , catholicism , islam & judaism and each stanza ends with `` and it 's all fault of [ insert_denomination ] , not to mention the jews '' while the last one ends with `` it 's all human 's fault , not to mention god '' ) - [ s\u0105d nad goy\u0105 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdfebp8ifgs ) ( = court over [ f. goya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francisco_goya ) , author goes through his major works ) - [ opowie\u015b\u0107 pewnego emigranta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv4rg2ufn0o ) ( = the story of some emigrant ; after ww2 history of polish/russian jews under one guy 's memories ), 
  hahaha on what world are you living ? 
  ( military ) economically , sure eu could `` go by '' , but it 's not worth it . 
  even if , then what ? 
  align with even worse or separate ourselves from the rest of the world ? 
  you independence or wellbeing depends on it  how can you morally criticize the us when you aid it and do n't oppose it ? 
  seems unfair . 
  world is unfair and not as simple as you describe it to be also many of eu countries openly oppose us foreign policies in `` strong worded letters '', 
   but if you 're so angry about the actions the us is taking you should make it one couse it 's our main ally ? 
  also there are far pressing matters than that also for your argument `` but you are so way more to bash russia '' : couse countries invaded/invading are direct neighbour , not some shithole god-knows-where you do n't seem to have a grasp of how politics work, 
  native : polish very good , nearly fluent : english just some basics : swedish and german ( have n't used them in a long time and they kind of fused together ) i ' v learnt korean alphabet , but nothing more want to learn : bring either swedish or german to ( can not decide ) my english level ; next would be chinese ----------------------- school ( eastern poland ) : - elementary : you start with either german or english ( with vast majority having english ) - gymnasium : you continue previously selected one + pick one more ( i had english and could pick from : german , russian and french ; in school the ration was something around 70 % german , 20 % russian , 10 % french ) - highschool : same as previously : english main + you could pick another one ( same list as previously , you could eitehr pick new or continue previously picked ) - university ( economy ) : you had to pick your basic foreign language in which you had field specialised course + another one , you could chose from : english , german , russian , spanish , italian , french , swedish or polish if you are not native . 
  majority of people had english as basic and most picked spanish as 2nd, 
  couse country-us relation is not the main electoral bulletpoint on which election fate depends, 
  would be easier to record ourselves than work with fucked up english alphabet ; ) also just give the link in your main post as there question 's op can hear it said in both variations, 
   czech republic  we do n't have any problems with them they quite regulary make anti-polish-food campaigns  ukraine , i heard lviv is a nice city \u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88  belarus [ mi\u0144sk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp1e28tkfp0 ) in general super clean , neat cities that look quite similar to bia\u0142ystok [ animated history of belarus vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yngqna7hrhc ) ( [ english subs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxlagbg9qkm ) )  russia st.petersburg  moscow , not even close, 
  would n't `` i '' e better ? 
  or just go polish way - lublana, 
  here it 's more common than it used to be , but still not very common ( aside from small trips to neighbouring countries ) . 
  once per year/few years could be considered good , many people were n't abroad at all . 
   people travel all the time do n't they ? 
  not really, 
  but seriously it would be us , germany or uk, 
  it 's way to small , but i never order soda - beer , juice or water, 
  any info about your qualifications mayby ? 
  you ask like some 10yo kid , not an adult that considers to move, 
  i guess you should be asking americans ( eg on / r/askreddit ) mayby it 's just that it 's not as taboo as in us - you can see uncensored boobs on tv here , people shower naked on pools in scandinavian countries or go naked into sauna, 
  they do n't come with kids though, 
   the railways that were built during soviet times have different standards for op : that applies to countries that were part of soviet unions aka baltics , belarus , ukriane , moldova and russia other ex-eastern block countries got standard size tracks, 
  in poland we eg . 
  got some italian [ pendolino trains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa8mnsdn1hq ) or homemade pesa 's [ dart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9eggcqgz7a ) ( they are not going at max speed though ) , [ high speed tracks ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kolej_du%c5%bcych_pr%c4%99dko%c5%9bci_w_polsce#/media/file:pol_rail_pendolino.svg ) in poland . 
  [ wiki english article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-speed_rail_in_poland ) we concentrate more on mid speed trains i guess as our track infrastructure needs some investing . 
  also [ why trains suck in america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbefzucloaq ) , we are an example of shitty country who has faster trains than us fastest one, 
  technically part of it is in europe - so it 's here . 
  simialr case as with turkey , but even less . 
  / edit : [ map ] ( http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/files/2013/07/1133_eurasiangs.png ), 
  same thing , especially for iran - what got me to look more into it was some food documentary i ' v seen and later some random , low views backpacker video of teheran on yt also you may enjoy [ my persian music playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl35o0ibmaer2lgh-xu0nltw06i6yk1wla ) ( mainly jazzy tracks ), 
  for me it 's cs/quake/starcraft in net cafes, 
  keep in mind the living costs differ by a ton between countries, 
   how common is it to use `` socialist '' to mean that in europe ? 
  very rare , especially in ex eastern block countries . 
  socialist `` means '' communist and it 's a term that has as bad ring to it as nazi . 
  people will use `` social '' for this meaning . 
  in terms of system used in nordic countries it 's called welfare state, 
  the thing is it 's still open window and one decision can shift the legacy he leaves, 
  is it ? 
  slavic or latin accents sounds much worse in english, 
   in english holland is normally used as a somewhat informal synonym for the netherlands , just like america is used for the united states . 
  in many languages it 's the common , even formal version, 
   does swedish sound ugly normally ? 
  quite the opposite , imo best sounding languge from germanic languges, 
   politically , we are not big fans of orban ( although the right wing loves him ) and pis , and during the refugee crisis the v4 were seen as `` not helping , just taking '' . 
  but again , some people praised them because they were against refugees in austria , too . 
  wait was n't austria also not fan of refugees in the end ? 
  i had impression you were up for criticising hungary until refugees got to austrian border , then it your possition switched, 
  any country outside capitals/heavy turist/financial centers, 
  and what if erdogan ends up kicking turkey into new golden age ? 
  it 's pretty pointless to ask such questions while he is in rule , especially when most of info you got is from media that can be turned on its head in few days time, 
  ofc, 
   possibly , because most people would n't realise it is sung in german magic of church choirs and opera music - you never know the lyrics and barely can say what language it 's in, 
  my entry for swedish : [ balladen om briggen blue bird av hull ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxmj6hfzbe ) or [ r\u00f6cklavisan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aezx2__spvo ), 
   nel blu dipinto di blu it 's probably the default italian song people think of here ,

  the song is probably as polish at it can get - polish aristocracy setting , music and lyrics are by our bigest composer and poet respectively chopin ( this version is killar 's variation of it ) and mickiewicz / edit : some people would kill me if i had n't included [ anna german - cz\u0142owieczy los ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6cchuc3aoa ) male : - [ marek grechuta - ocali\u0107 od zapomnienia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de0h_wqxziq ) , his most know song : [ dni ktorych nie znamy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og6peolakm8 ) and a bit faster ones : [ nie dokazuj ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6j_jroaixs ) or [ w dzikie wino zaplatani ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw1swzywgvo ) - [ tadeusz wo\u017aniak - zegarmistrz \u015awiat\u0142a purpurowy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obvizjrneza ) - [ edyta g\u00f3rniak & mietek szcz\u0119\u015bniak - dumka na dwa serca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amp24hddz9c ) couse it 's a duo ( bonus2 at the bottom ) i believe polish suits more femine voices ----------------------------------------------- bonus : mix between polish and russian ( you could say it 's belarusian : p ; she switches from russian to polish mid song when people are getting confused , but with heavy russian accent ) : [ song from `` little moscow '' by swiet\u0142ana chodczenkowa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmzm7pcs0ug ) and [ here 's strictly polish version of the song by anna czartoryska ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-nla9arsc4 ) for comparison bonus2 : [ the same song in ukrainian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg28nydhf30 ), 
  compared to what ? 
  / r/thenetherlands embassys exist for a reason https://www.government.nl/topics/dutch-nationality/contents/becoming-a-dutch-national, 
  imo russia started to go away from europe with their revolution with turkey i see them more of a middleeastern country that sipped some european culture and was not sure whether it wants more . 
  for me it fits more with countries like lebadon , syria ( before the war ) or pre islamic revolution iran, 
  we ( and belarus & ukraine ) got similar foods ( mostly potatoe based ) eg . 
  there were few clashes between turks and kurds in germany , hard to call it terrorism though, 
  reminder for americans : europe uses [ 4 direction spectrum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_compass ) instead of us right-left, 
   would i consider russia a culturally european country i would say they are border line european , but going into it 's own direction ( along with few other ex-soviet states ),

   kebab pizza you can find it everywhere in europe i believe, 
  sms or facebook messenger, 
  germany it 's cool couse took part in reconciliation and put focus into working out better relations , we also share much of the same values . 
  the nature of rivality is more possitive one - we see them having superior economy and state , so we treat them as a role model in many aspects with russia it 's opposite - not only there was no reconciliation , but they also hide documents , denay any wrong doing and use agressive language . 
  their state , economy and mind set is opposite of what is generally valued, 
  yeah , it 's great but i decided leave it and babka ziemniaczana so that lithuanians & belarusians do n't get butthurt ; ),

  - breakfast : scrambled eggs with onion , kielbasa and tomatoes - for soup i would pick : [ \u017curek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sour_rye_soup ) - for main meal it would be some venison with mushroom souce , potatoes and some salad or duck/geese with fruits ( apples , pears or plums ) - from cakes : [ szarlotka ( apple pie ) with icecream ] ( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.przepisy.pl/przepisy3ii/img/variants/290x0/szarlotka-z-lodami.jpg ) - drink : [ kompot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kompot ) ( cherry one is the best ) - alcohol : some home made [ nalewka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nalewka ) - supper/small meal : [ pierogi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi ) ( with fruit filling and sour cream ) or [ potato pancakes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potato_pancake ) with sour cream or sugar - fast food : [ zapiekanka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zapiekanka ) ( pizza-like thing - heated baguette + mushrooms + cheese + whatever you like , with ketchup on top ) bonus : [ bigos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bigos ) ( chopped meat of various kinds stewed with sauerkraut and shredded fresh cabbage ) , not mentioned upper cosue i 'm not a fan of it, 
  my elementary had one class made of kids needing special attention - not disabled , but with adhd or learning problems my gimnazjum ( 3years , stage between elementary and highschool ) was for best students in region , still public , but they took only around 60 students ( 2 , max 3 classes ) per year . 
  to get there you needed nearly maxed grades + often some additional science/sport awards . 
  pretty much school for nerds highschool ( also high grades entry treshhold ) - was connected with gimnazjum ( same principal , techers , building etc ) was very `` getting to the best unis '' centric ( focused not only on getting best matura exam scores , but also had some additional curses to prepare for uni - eg . 
  math , physics , chemistry that is n't covered in highschool program ) . 
  there were 6 classes ( each around 25-30 people ) divided into 4 types : math-physics-it ( for people who plan to go for tech uni ) , biology-chemistry-math ( for people going for medical/biotech ) , math-geography ( for economy/finance/accounting / geographyrelated ) + 3 classes for undecided people ( 1 year you had all subjects advanced , and later you had to pick in which direction you wanted to go ) sum up : in poland the division based on ability happens mostly after each stage when you need to pick the school that will accept you ( which is based on grades , end of stage exams , plus various science/sport competitions ), 
  without a thought it seems a great idea , but then you start to go into details you will see how problematic that becomes - lot of minorities , borders golore with dozen en/exclaves . 
  mayby if they made it into a longterm process - where minorities get economic incentives to move and borders were smoothen up . 
  anyway you would need people to want that, 
  eastern ukraine/caucasus russia is also promising, 
  it 's more of `` we fought one guy 's army + locals for it '' than the whole country, 
  same in poland .
