  it comes down to `` wob wob wob '' ( bass over voice ), 
  actually it 's neither ( since more of the differences are in spoken/law ) . 
  we are taught to be grammar nazis . 
  if you get to specialised curses level you learn both, 
   from your colonies ? 
   since they are only fighting isis in order to make their own country . 
  with assad it was stable enough to make trips to syria , with rebels it 's big question mark, 
  nor poland, 
  in general germany & russia strictly economically : other v4 countries, 
  dunno what are you talking about our part of europe is pretty fine in this regard ; ) seriouslt though most recent attack was some random dude who decided he wants to kill some people . 
  it 's nearly impossible to prevent such stuff, 
  also people forget/are not awere of - from banking it 's mostly wages paid that are counted into gdp, 
  it 's really a thing ? 
  minus the reindeers though, 
  the only one i will be watching is fencing and mayby volleyball, 
  we do those on `` polish language '' aka literature, 
  wow that 's pretty retarded, 
  did n't know online degrees exist, 
  you got some reading problems i guess, 
  never even heard such claim, 
   as soon as flags or other symbols appear , it is nationalism . 
  that 's really weird , even absurd, 
  that article is exactly what i mean - most is just collection of various dishes from other countries, 
   american cuisine what would that exactly be ? 
  ( serious question ) only american foods that come to my mind are fastfoods . 
  burgers , but not from wordwide chains ? 
   is mushroom picking a common thing to do in austria it 's very common in most of europe, 
  oh yea those are also assholes . 
  it 's hard to make this thread serious with the fauna we got here - it 's either some big forest animals ( like bisons , boars , bears , wolves , moose etc ) or get stung by some insect you are allergic to and of top of that many of those are endangered species living in national parks . 
  realistically , most dangerous situation you could get in probably finding some boar or attacked by some domesticated animal, 
  you see - uk is not the only country with dangerous animals in europe, 
  [ sea boars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txutnhnieda ) we also got cats that can be assholes , flies , wasps and mosquitoes, 
  cool story bro, 
  here literature is reserved for `` polish language '' lessons where you cover various authors, 
  i find it surprising you do literature on foreign language classes . 
  here on language classes you do mostly grammar and vocab , reading is limited pretty much to articles, 
  [ foreign authors ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4h1r9j/what_books_did_you_read_in_secondary_school/d2ngxh4 ) from another thread some important polish ones : - jan kochanowski : various poems - adam mickiewicz : `` pan tadeusz '' , `` dziady '' , `` romantyczno\u015b\u0107 '' and various poems ( eg . 
  only from movies like pocahontas , the last of the mohicans or dances with wolves or westerns , so pretty much nothing . 
  big central/southern american civilizations ( aztecs , mayans , incas ) got more legit coverage, 
  sport stuff is considered as fluff the `` school pride '' if there is such thing is connected with various rankings eg . 
  number of finalist/laureates of various science tests , averege matura exam , averege grades needed to join the school , for uni it would be points needed to join the uni , employment rate after studies or av . 
  earning after . 
  it may be also age of the school - often the old ones are the best, 
  minus the cargo pants and you got steorotypical pole/german, 
  [ look up this vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kebjkfloefa ), 
  either dodgeball or basketball . 
  i remember we played dodgeball on most pe lessons in elementary, 
  depends on the front we are expiriencing - it can be 0 - -10 if it 's western front or -35 if it 's eastern . 
  the big negatives are the eastern , continental ( syberian ) colds so they are very dry and you do n't feel the cold that bad ( it 's usually also sunny then ) . 
  you feel -15 in hummid western/northen wind much worse than -30 continental . 
  last few winters were very mild ( more like autumn ) with mayby 2 weeks of real winter, 
  no such thing if someone sings it 's some random melody, 
  mostly nothing - i prefer to sleep few minutes longer as for most standard polish breakfast ( usually weekend ) it would be scrambled eggs ( either with onion , chive , some meat ) , tomatoes and bread with butter, 
  giving temperature only is a bit missleading as air humidity & wind plays a big role in how you expirience weather . 
   but in reality is very good . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.drivingdirectionsandmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/europe-according-to-culinary-horror-2013.png ) covers some, 
  may be , question is about now, 
  that seems to be taken as an offence only in us, 
  poland : there can be more than one ethnic group in a country ? 
  ah did n't look at post age brb reading articles / edit : looked like testing the waters , not much of substance, 
  ~ ~ what opinion can we have if both sides have not said anything ... ~ ~ ~ ~ this question would make some sense after the visit ~ ~, 
  nope , not possible, 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
   where is the ignorance ? 
  complete lack of knowladge about islam , muslims , arabs and middle east in general . 
  what 's the point of posting the list ? 
  not to mention assholes who threw buckets full of water out/onto moving cars or water/water-filled-balloons from high building floors, 
  people have nothing to do with terrorism . 
  as a matter of fact terrorism does n't exist, 
  in poland ton of people do to the point muslim , arab and terrorist often synonymus . 
  ignorance is pretty big, 
  it 's nearly symbolic now though ( or at least nothing compared to what used to be ), 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6liuffdrag ), 
  i ' v only downvoted op 's first copy-paste response, 
  yes , spelling : guy * nothing homophobic or racist about that pm lol . 
  you just replayed me with irrevelant info, 
  this may interesst you : [ watchmojo : top 10 craziest fans in football ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll_gchosk4c )  is football ` hooligan ' culture a big problem in your country ? 
  yes  would you feel safe wearing your team 's jersey alone in your rival team 's city/territory ? 
  it 's a way to get beaten ( or even killed ) in some regions, 
   i do n't see why it 's our responsibility to take care of people who want to live in europe ? 
  you completley miss the point - it 's about helping a warzone regions  should we start sending money to the bremain voters ? 
  because they want to live in europe too . 
  sorry but i dunno what you wanted to say here also why are you copy-pasting your initial post ? 
  i believe he 's more interessed about far east countries , not middle east, 
  to lift some pressure out of europe/war zone bordering countries , especialy the wealthy , n / edit : to be clear : `` other wealthy countires should help lift the pressure '' not `` lift pressure from european wealthy countries '', 
  it was somewhat popular ( in a sense of training ) something like 20 years ago ( ? ) . 
  along with box it was the go-to fighting sport , but since the rise of asian martial arts , mma , kickboxing or krav maga it got nearly forgotten . 
  i believe it 's still a thing in - stan & caucasus countries . 
  there are some clubs still practising it , but the sport got left really behind compared the other martial arts, 
  only met one guy who was fan of it from motor sports only speedway is somewhat popular and has big fanbase in some cities , aside from that there was a short time of f1 when our driver - kubica got some results, 
  for voluntary blood donation we get a box of choccolate, 
  poland - straightforwardness/honesty, 
  just write country/city in october/november on youtube and look what people are wearing, 
  no , not really while i hate pis and find most of their ideas dumb , they are noone to be scarred of . 
  if it was a 100point scale of stability we moved down something like 5 points, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union#/media/file:union_of_soviet_socialist_republics_ ( orthographic_projection ) . svg, 
  i guess more overly religious route - new earth creationism museums or the anti-evolution movements . 
  dr.oz stuff is more of ignorance ( but still it 's weird it 's possible to broadcast false medical stuff that can actually hurst people ), 
  to add - open acceptance of anti-science stuff, 
  to add  poland is the last stronghold of catholicism keep in mind it 's special kind of religiosity - people go to church on sundays , it matters what the priest says , but barely anyone prays at home or ever read the bible,
