  block i live in atm is from '80s ( do n't rememebr exactly ) from oldest it 's hard to say , highschool i went to is over 400years old . 
  cathedral from my home town is from 1400-something ( rebuild , renovated mutiple times ofc ) . 
  oldest would probably some castle or cathedral from early medival times, 
  have not noticed one on my departments ( menagement & economy departments of gda\u0144sk uni ) , mayby they got them on the main campus where almost all other departments are ( menagement & economy are in sopot , oceanography is in gdynia iirc and rest in gda\u0144sk ) since big chunk of the campus is new, 
  mayby start from some software subs, 
  well at least they indeed got different winters compared to what we got here . 
  just a bit exaggerated . 
  `` has umlauts ? 
  then it 's german '', 
  yep , although it has changed a bit - it 's not only vodka anymore , now people drink everything - wines , whiskey , drinks , beer etc ( which is pretty annoying when doing a party ) ; ), 
  steorotypes : - ( china ) we hate china - ( us ) we are dumb missinformation : - charged cavalry against german tanks - `` polish death camps '' - we are russian/speak russian - we were part of ussr - did n't exist before ww1/2 - grey commieblock jungle - how religious we are ( or how it looks like - americans usually picture is as steorotypical southern us with the creationism , bumperstickers , praying before the meal etc ), 
  nope . 
  most that could change is getting croatia and mayby someday romania & bulgaria into schengen . 
  it 's hard to lift something that people consider to be the most usefull and possitive things about the eu, 
  no , not really, 
   anti-russian it 's a nation defining characteristic . 
  seriously though - pretty much anything putin/ussr related is pure evil . 
  no problem with people as long as they do n't support `` russia did nothing wrong '' narrative  anti-chinese not much in this department aside from `` everything is produced in china , shitty quality '' or `` soon everyone will be chinese ''  anti-american we are rather americanophilic , still bitter for their visa policy towards us, 
  for pronunciation, 
  use google transaltor, 
  i wonder why you get downvoted, 
  we are in peculiar possition where media propaganda is not even needed . 
  through education it 's pretty much in our head that russia will someday attack again . 
  it was ok in early 2000 , but started go south with georgia and smolensk . 
  ukraine was a breaking point where people started `` massively '' sign up for paramilitary/shooting schools and clubs, 
  simplest for a standard car for private use 2 % from market value of the car during transaction or vat - `` noone '' knows how much it is since you get prices with taxes , unlike us ( 23 % iirc , i 'm to lazy to search how much it is ) . 
  then you got the registering fee which is dependand on dozen of things ( if the car is imported , from a dealer , where has it been registered before etc ) . 
  anyway you pay it straight up , there 's no tax you pay over time . 
  from fees you got to pay over times it 's mostly insurance and costs related to maintenance, 
  native : polish kind of fluent ( c1 ) - english ( i ' v been using it pretty much only on internet/watching movies for last couple of years so my grammar , spelling and fancy vocab deteriorated heavily ) other : german and swedish , have n't used them in a long time and they fused into one plans : lift up either swedish or german to english level ( can not decide which , plan is to start in few weeks ) and start new mandarin or arabic in a bit further time perspective, 
  there 's [ pyrcon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyrkon ) in pozna\u0144 and iem katowice seems to be annual thing now ( both are gaming , dunno for anime , but comics are really a thing here ), 
  but the question is about martial status , not about relationships . 
  bad , confusing wording in general, 
   q5 : no cohabit option ? 
  domestic partnership covers that imo, 
  pretty weird , inconsistent ethnicity breakdown - one one hand you go by skin color and other by nationality . 
  would anyone in europe asked about ethnicity without any options given answer as `` white '' ? 
  i do n't remember it being perticularly bad , but expected it to be better since everybody always drank it, 
  i remember dad letting me sip the foam from his beer , but dunno how old i was then around 10 - i took a vodka shoot from the table to taste it first time legitly drinking with family - 18 oh and as a kid i loved non-alcohol beer my mom used to drink - karmi anyway drinking was never a problem in my family . 
  smoking , however , was a big no-no, 
  it 's soon \u2122 , not soon is n't 2speed eu almost a thing ( at least as much as brexit ), 
  crucial to our safety , but in the same time many people do n't believe west would help in case of attack, 
  must have had a hard childhood, 
  you asked for do-nothing celebrities , i guess that disqulifies her from the beginning, 
  woah she is ugly, 
   bonus points if no one outside your country has ever heard of them . 
  hahahaha that 's cute you should reverse that to `` celebrities that are known outside the host country get bonus points '' no1 for do-nothing celebrities going to : [ grycanki ] ( http://cdn7.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/t/171176/grycanki-marta-grycan-wiktoria-grycan_19909804.jpg ) - they are the wife and 3 daughters of a polish ice cream magnate ( yes , you heard correctly , ice cream magnate ! ) . 
  if doda is a sex bomb , they deserve the title of the atomic bombs of polish show business after the last few months -- they 're awesomeness is measured in xxxl size . 
  they are literally everywhere : in the morning on breakfast tv , in the afternoon you can see ( i 'm lazy and not exactly up to date with this so i used [ source ] ( http://www.foreignersinpoland.com/famous-polish-celebrities/ ) ), 
  it was one of the standard outcomes predicted newstitles of `` brexit end of eu or chance for deeper integration ? '', 
  - kind popped out often, 
  so you ' v written a pointless butthurt post instead , gj, 
  i would add that gay/lesbian/bi is getting normal , but trans has bad due to looks, 
  women get stares couse they stand out , aside from that normal i think . 
  men got worse - may attract ultranationalists/hooligans or drunk people , especially when they try to pick up women , cases like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simon_mol#accusations_of_hiv_criminal_infection ) made it quite hard for black men, 
  oh you can also look up / r/shitamericanssay /, 
  it 's not about that the destinations , but claiming them to be the whole europe, 
  few annoying things : assumption that we follow your politics closely - there have been people asking about who will win freaking 1-2years before the elections another thing is assuming we got the same holidays - like it 's often with eg . 
  thanksgiving ( there have been even few cases when people were surprised we do n't celebreate 4th of july , ffs ) my personal one : claiming to go on a trip around the whole europe , which is always limited to london , paris and barcelona, 
  not already mentioned : - being offended by everything - some weird problems with nipples, 
  it plays the similar role to what krak\u00f3w is for poland ( which also is n't the capital ), 
   ~ ~ moscow ~ ~ saint petersburg - better option and you can easier put it into baltics/finland trip also i would add lviv in ukraine, 
  people need to know how it works though , which usually is n't the case, 
  sources for slovenia are from 2013 so that may be reason, 
  you got table for eu here https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kwota_wolna_od_podatku ( country/threshold/in euro / % of average salary, 
  it also has caps eg . 
  max 2h per day for first 8h and later max 3h per day . 
  theory curse also covers 4h of theoretical and practical first aid, 
  i believe both are equally good , depends where you want to go, 
  i assume you are asking for standard car aka b category poland : - age : 18 at the exam day - health is ok ( you go for health/mental check ) - curses : 30h theory / 30h driving with instructor ; price from random google search : ~ 850-1300pln ( 213,6-326 ,7 usd , depends on city ) , after compliting the curse you can sign up for exam - exam fees : theory test : 22pln ( 5,5 usd ) and ~ 110 pln ( 27,6 usd ) driving exam , you need to pass the theory to get to driving exam . 
  exams are considered `` hard ' - average pass rate in 2014 was 34,5 % ( one of the lowest in eu , we stil however got one of the highest road accidents per capita * ) usually you drive on manual gears cars : renault clio , toyota yaris or fiat punto public transaport is good in big cities , in smaller ones it may be better to have own car , but people usually make the license anyway . 
  also people often go to take the exam in smaller towns as they often got simpler ( less traffic , no complicated crossing or big roundabouts ) layout and are cheaper * [ graphic ] ( http://galeria.bankier.pl/p/a/f/d908d46aa9c0a0-645-254-0-0-660-260.jpg ) left : road victims per 1mln people ( blue diagram ) ; right : avg pass rate ( red line ) ; countries from left : germany , ireland , sweden , great britain and poland ; [ full paper on road safty by european commission 2015 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/pdf/vademecum_2015.pdf ) ( page 9 ), 
  we got the luxury of them not wanting to come here . 
  some of those who apply for refugee status get it - this year 21 syrians were granted refugge status + 7 iraquis and 3 syrians were granded `` ochrona uzupe\u0142niaj\u0105ca '' status ( whatever that entails ) . 
  [ source in polish ] ( http://wgospodarce.pl/informacje/25449-wiemy-ilu-cudzoziemcow-otrzymalo-w-polsce-status-uchodzcy ) ( migration office site does n't work to check exact numbers ), 
  what do you mean ? 
  the thing is they do n't refuse refugees , they refuse refugee quotas ( which may be a violation of human rights since they force people to resettlement against their will ), 
   article 14 many people are against illegal immigrants , who come to a country by not respecting and breaking laws . 
  not many ( i guess ) are completley against refugees  article 26 well yes , but it starts being a problem when the education starts to be against human rights, 
  you post is pretty pointless without mentioning where are you from, 
  firefighters iirc are the most trusted and liked group among public servants . 
  with police it 's a bit different - there 's still some distrust/dislike towards police left coming from communism/transformation era , but it will rather die out soon . 
  bribes are also much less common compared to what used to be so the image as well as quality is going up . 
  most fuss they get recently is related with inappropriate use of power ( both too weak and overreaction ) . 
  there 's also football hooligan groups who are super antipolice , but they are special kind of people, 
  netherlands are called holland in many languages so sellers cater to them, 
  it 's pretty expensive . 
  people do n't usually do it , unless they need it for work ( like military , neval things ) or got too much money, 
  hard to say among young people i know more of them wear contacts, 
  hmm black and lgbt - pretty bad combo for poland , but considering you are aiming for it it 's not as big of deal as it usually entails sitting in the academic/metropolitan areas . 
  it 's even better if you are a girl ( ? ), 
  atm , as it 's black men who are way more likely to encounter problems here . 
  the planned sex change would be problematic here i guess . 
  poland can not compete with scandinavia or germany here , here 's some travel spotlight vids anyway : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekz6i58kvpi ) ; [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muiofzubcgg ) and [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbu_frg8vuu ), 
  well i know english pretty well and i 'm ( and lot of other people in the same situation ) learning other languages as well , mainly couse english is not enough ( in some industries it 's not even considered a foreign language ) for job market . 
  i know bit of german and swedish with a plan to elevate my swedish to english level . 
  so the answer is : i would definitly pick another one, 
  depends what are you looking for, 
  for my whole life us was the dream destination for poles . 
  as for now is rather meh - we to some extent cought up to the living standards , popular culture is very close ( we got everything that is in us + more ) and start to see all the weird things about it - the different kind of religiosity or rasizm/pc , shit quality housing , dreadful city planing ( pretty much no public transport ) , over insurence , dumbing down of many thing due to absurd lawsuits , education system etc it 's stil however a rollmodel that having your own company can be way easier .
