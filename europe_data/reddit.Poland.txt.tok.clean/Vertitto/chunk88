  mayby much diversity in brands , but big differences in their ( percived ) relation/market share, 
  thx for help,

  cellphone : samsung galaxy laptop : dell , lenovo , hp , asus , acer tv : samsung , lg , sharp , panasonic game consoles : pc , poland is pcmasterrace stronhold ( historical reasons * ) tablets : samsung in general apple products are not that popular here compared to us / edit : historical reasons : due to communism/transformation we missed out on console & arcade boom , we had various cheap pirated designs like famous [ pegasus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pegasus_ ( console \\ ) ) though . 
  society was n't that wealthy people were buying pcs for `` work/study '' ( multipurpose ) instead of only-gaming consoles , furthermore we had very active and socially acceptable pirate scene so people were getting high quality pc games for pennies .

  [ ways of acquiring polish citizenship ] ( https://mswia.gov.pl/en/document/ways-of-acquiring-poli/793,ways-of-acquiring-polish-citizenship.html )  in the next two years , i will be stripped of my european citizenship unless i can get citizenship in another eu country first . 
  where did you get that from ? 
  would be great if people stopped making stuff up . 
  gb is not even leaving the eu yet, 
  i would bet for non - in worst case scenario eu of two speeds will get implemented, 
  we are talking about now , not future probabilistics  there are other eu member states with even bigger percentages of ** euroscepticism ** than the uk . 
  `` euroscepticism '' - it 's thrown a lot and works as huge umbrella under which are both parties that just do n't like the idea of further integration or specific aspects of eu ( eg like how ecb works or how eu goes about free movement of people ) and parties that are completely `` no '' to the idea of eu . 
  they are so different that puting them together has nearly no sense, 
   but what if the pis fucked up really , really bad oh , they do it on nearly weekly basis ; ) people can always change mind . 
  if we start to make if-scenarions like that anything is possible . 
  atm pis has the president and absolute majority in parliament so they can do pretty much anything they want as in general - no , we do n't have one party democracy system as default . 
  also another thing - many people or parties are lebaled as eurosceptic in media , but it 's not often said in what way - some are against further integration , some are against euro currency , some against open borders , not many are against the concept of eu as a whole, 
  can not say for other countires , but for poland - yes . 
  the rulling party pis , that is said to be very eurosceptic said that leaving eu is not even taken under consideration . 
  you can look up eurobarometer for various stats regarding eu support in each country, 
   how many countries are seriously flirting with dumping the eu ? 
  there are some parties in each country that would like to leave , but non of them is significant enough to make anything happen, 
  my portfolio lost few % , that would be about it, 
  now old one : [ late xv - mid xvii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_golden_age ) - when it was poland bullying russia ; ), 
  it 's the us that would have problem with that . 
  to this day some eu members got problems with getting a visa, 
  yes, 
   on private land you should ask for permission also pretty important - some forest are private property as well, 
  probably `` i plan to make a trip to europe , but i dunno where , looking for ideas '', 
  there are some students , i ' v seen few black people while working in the shipyard and i ' v been passing by 2 black guys regulary at my bus stop + ofc turists, 
  http://www.russiatourism.ru/en/contents/statistika/statistical-indicators-of-mutual-trips-by-citizens-of-the-russian-federation-and-citizens-of-foreign-states/ [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_russia ), 
   a lot of older poles can speak russian at least a little if not very well . 
  for 50 + i 'd guess their russian skills are better than english . 
  hmm it 's a bit overexagerated - they claim to speak it but it boils down to them knowing mayby 2 sentences in broken russian , while in the same time not knowing english outside some words that are used in polish . 
  russian has the advantage of being a slavic language , so you can work you way with simple phrases , flexing thesaurus and hand gestures . 
  going for broken english is often more effective though . 
  keep in mind russian is the furthest language from polish among slavic languages so it 's not that easy considering there 's no cultural/political ties among the countires like there used to be . 
  among students i believe you would sooner find people speaking spanish or french than russian, 
  even mediterranean regions ? 
  people laugh but it 's exactly the same in poland or germany - it 's just weird to talk to random people, 
  i guess the point was not to get stabbed ; ), 
   you could disarm most knives with a rolling pin pretty easily eeee have you ever handled a knife ? 
  it 's not movie where they grab twist and lock the arm being unharmed . 
  if the opponent actually wants to hurt you ( instead of using it as a intimidation tool ) then in best case scenario you will end up bleeding from multiple wounds ( my expirience : trening fencing , we do knife from time to time ), 
  you have to take into account that in some of the countries are nearly gun free, 
  it 's pretty unclear - there 's the problem whether the undertaken action was a necessity so it 's often up to the judge/prosecutor/lawyer . 
  however in majority of cases i guess the victim of an assault has the upper hand . 
  mayby someone versed in law will chip in, 
  [ wolters world : austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/woltersworld/search?query=austria ), 
  my point is about quality difference not about the brands themselves, 
  dunno if it counts , but big brand sport shoes ( nike , addidas etc ) . 
  the quality difference of products made for american market and polish one is absurd . 
  i do n't not enough about it to have a solid opinion ( like how people feel , how administration works etc ) . 
  i treat it as if it was a country with asterisk added, 
  only [ `` christ of europe/nations '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe ) comes to my mind, 
  i would n't expect those to be ; ), 
  depends on the angle you are looking at from, 
  in reddit terms i would describe it as `` glorified circlejerk of how cool french language & culture is '', 
  [ the european union explained * by cgp grey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ) may explain few things, 
  it 's not even a union, 
  roman language and more importantly  french is understood and spoken by 26 % of the population https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_the_organisation_internationale_de_la_francophonie countries like greece or armenia are more curious cases, 
  we do n't stand a chance in the weirdness department , but are they fabulous enough ? 
  it 's not a thing that is talked about in great detail  glorious moment when an oppressed people liberated themselves from an oppressive regime noone cares for such thing , it 's just date , causes & consequences , and we get back to europe for more important stuff us gets mayby one , max two lesson on history classes ( creation + civil war ) and almost most important part is that tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko and kazimierz pu\u0142aski took part in it . 
  i guess i could ask you in similar manner how do americans see union between poland and lithuania or partitions of plc. 
  even if you had it mentioned , i doubt anyone had any view on it, 
  vid in question : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_h7lsops1c ( [ with polish subs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wu4xrv47zq ) ), 
  what ? 
  but the game quality of polish team was horrendous , nothing close to what they represented before, 
  yea , it was n't even close tbh, 
  badminton , volleyball or football if there are kids, 
  as much as eu being a country, 
  poland was n't part of ussr, 
   very nationalistic never seen this mentioned as east/west divide, 
  for children 's day we invited them to play a friendly match so that they can feel for a lil how being part of euro2016 feels ( match starts 20:30 ), 
  western world : democratic , roots from ancient rome/greece and christianity + everything that spowned from those central europe : close to geographic center , latin alphabet , catholic eastern eu : simply being on eastern border of eu, 
  for what country ? 
  there 's not much of them on reddit - it 's a small nation , reddit is not popular there and they often use russian language portals, 
  wiki articles : - [ telecommunications in belarus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telecommunications_in_belarus#internet ) - [ main tv channels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_television_channels_in_belarus ) ( longer article in russian ) - [ censorship in belarus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_belarus ) it 's seems pretty normal , you may get problems once you start getting more involved in political stuff i guess . 
  belarus is not n.korea, 
  yes , since elementary school . 
  in some regions ( mostly western poland ) kids start from learning german as their first foreign language, 
  i 'm just giving advice so he gets more responses, 
  you got country specific subs for such questions / r/austria, 
  couse you assume from start that one has a degree nowdays, 
  poland : there 's no such thing as collage here , there are few types of higher education schools : - university ( eg . 
  philosophy , law , administration , linguistic , philology , economic , finances , math , statistics , chemistry , biology , physics etc ) - politechnics ( tech unis , hard sciences , various kinds of engineering ) - medical unis - art/music academy - physical education academy - various officers academies ( eg . 
  police , army , navey , civil marine , civil flights etc ) in general the system is - for most : bachelor ( licencjat ; 3year ) + masters ( magister ; 2year ) + optional special curses eg . 
  2-4 years to get specialisation in law ( aplikacja ; eg . 
  for being a judge or notary ) - technical : engineer ( in\u017cynier , 3,5 year ) + masters ( magister ; 2year ) - medical : medical degree ( equivalent to masters , 6 years ) + 5/6years of specialisation ( combined with practise ) some curses do n't have split between bachelors and masters , you just have to go straight up for masters . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------ school system in general : - elementary 6y - junior high school 3y - highschool 3y ( or 4 if it 's [ technikum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technikum_%28polish_education%29 ) ; you go to these if you plan to go to some uni ) or vocational school ( if you want to be eg . 
  a welder ) - higher mentioned above, 
  foreign : do n't really have polish : leszek ko\u0142akowski ( philosophy essayist ), 
  nope ( i 'n not into adventure themes in general ), 
  i 'm ending finance & accounting degree preferably `` excel job '' ( audit , finances , planning ) in some company ( like shipyard ) . 
  next , little less preferable would be corpo audit ( like deloitte ) , some back room banking/insurence/leasing ( not selling ) or corporate finance bank department plus as a bonus keep investing in fx and stocks,
