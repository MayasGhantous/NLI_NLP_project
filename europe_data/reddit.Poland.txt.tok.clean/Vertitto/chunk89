  when learning swedish at uni out teacher gave as a listening in norwegian for lols and noone even noticed, 
  in school only one sentence that they were killed . 
  personally i know pretty much nothing about northen natives ( i ' v always hated westerns ) , while in school i ' v read some books and watched docs about central/southern american natives, 
  in polish system you got subject called `` polish language '' where you do spelling , gramatics , writing ( esseys etc ) , literature and culture study . 
  in elementary school it 's pretty much only spelling , grammar and some small books , as you progress in education it changes more and more to literature/culture studies . 
  [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4h1r9j/what_books_did_you_read_in_secondary_school/ ) about literature ( i posed there only foreign autors that get covered , focus is on polish ones ) in terms of foreign languages we do n't do literature of the studied language in school, 
  as flair suggest - poland, 
  i need to buckle up and finish my master thesis ( got around 2 weeks till deadline ) start searching for real job . 
  instead of doing that i 'm either sleeping , sitting on reddit or fencing , with breaks for depression sessions of how fucked i am . 
  so in general magical time of student life conclusion, 
  sounds like some financial term , does n't it ? 
  [ allotment ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=allotment ), 
  most standard working week is 5x8h  my understanding is home ownership is low in europe varies greatly between countries [ stats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate ) allotments are quite popular in cities some people engage in local politics or sports ( eg . 
  biking ) dunno if there 's anything specific in poland , i got impression that it 's very personalised issue, 
  psl : old village farmer/authority whose whole family is employed in local institutions run by him ( nepotism ftw ) or allotments owner pis : [ moherowe berety ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohair_berets ) , small towns , villages . n/po : naive corpo workers or entroponours razem : hipsters sld : old commies korwin : edgy teenagers rn : acab , white power, 
  flair up or write where are you from - without this info your posts is pointless, 
  here some teachers just use emails/fb, 
  pretty much each bigger city has few of their own [ calendar ] ( http://www.maratonypolskie.pl/mp_index.php?dzial=3&amp;action=1&amp;grp=13&amp;trgr=1&amp;bieganie ), 
  yes , but it was only one about vienna so i ' v decided to also include it, 
  these may help you : prague : - [ visit prague - top 10 sites in prague , czech republic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcszoyifr2o ) - [ visit prague - 5 things you will love & hate about prague , czech republic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvngtb0nmy8 ) vienna : - [ vienna - five things to love & hate about visiting vienna , austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rximqv7lndc ), 
  it 's the same thing . 
  there 's no `` x '' letter in polish alphabet, 
  according to raport by tns polska from 2014 ( [ source in polish ] ( http://www.tnsglobal.pl/wp-content/blogs.dir/9/files/2014/11/k.073_zwierz%c4%99ta_w_polskich_domach_o10a-14.pdf ) ) - ~ 48 % people got a pet ( 67 % in country side , 35 % in cities ) . 
  various herbs , cocumbers , onion and lettuce . 
  we also had tomatoes , carrots and radish , but they grew small or bitter and often worms grinded them down . 
  from fruits we had apple , plum and cherry trees ( fuck ravens and starlings ) , some grapes and gooseberry, 
   more linguistically diverse which might lead to fewer accents per language . 
  you would be surprised - there 's dozens of live , strong accents in small britain alone . 
  it 's different from country to country and size of country does n't really matter nowdays in polish the regionalisms nearly died out from everyday speach - it 's standardised to the point it 's hard to recognise where one is from unless he hyperboises it . 
  it 's not a thing people make fun of though - it 's more a simple indicator where someone is from . 
  look up recent thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4h1r9j/what_books_did_you_read_in_secondary_school/ when it comes to school - they are not really talked about . 
   `` is it safe for non-whites to travel to east germany ? '', 
  it 's a standard question in each country from the old block . 
  one of most absurd one was something along the lines of `` i 'm american with jewish roots , is it safe for me to go to poland ? '', 
  it 's pretty depressing, 
  never even heard anyone hiring an accountant . 
  it may happen for rich people who got income from multiple of sources ( standard job , multiple estate management , stocks , international flows , tax evansion etc ) . 
  for everyday joe ( even with fx/stock accont ) it 's simple process, 
   that we 're like a uber-slavic-post-communist-shithole i guess that applies to the whole old block , which is seen as one unified grey blob, 
  / u/fuckmengetmoney ok i think i ' v finished the multiple edits ; ) reading other comments : - all translated into polish - we do them on polish lessons - we do n't have a split between grammar/spelling etc and litaerature , you just start from gramatics/spelling and simple text and writing forms in elementary and as you go the gramatics/spelling gets shifted to more and more into literature/culture studies, 
  not many similarities with your list - most of entries from your list were not even mentioned full list from curriculum from around i was in highschool ( polish highschool is 3 years , preceded by 3 years of junior highschool and 6 elementary ; you start elementary at 6 or 7 ) ) some titles are optional or just brushed most attention goes to ancient classics and polish works ; there some that are not on the list , but i 'm not in mood to wiggle through my memory to fill them in i decided to get rid of polish entries and stick only with foreign authors to make the post shorter ## ** highschool ** ## - various stuff from bible and greek mythology + ancient epics iliad and odyssey - sophocles `` oedipus '' and `` antigone '' - horace ( various poetry ) - william shakespeare `` macbeth '' and `` king lear '' - johann wolfgang von goethe `` the sorrows of young werther '' and `` faust '' ( fragments - fyodor dostoyevsky `` crime and punishment '' - joseph conrad `` heart of darkness '' - albert camus `` the plague '' - dante `` inferno '' ( fragments ) - franz kafka `` the trial '' - molier `` tartuffe '' - mikhail bulgakov `` the master and margarita '' ## ** junior highschool ** ## - william shakespeare `` romeo and juliet '' - a. de sain-exupery `` the little prince '' - e. hemingway `` the old man and the sea '' - molier `` the miser '' ## ** elementary school ** ## - frances hodgson burnett `` the secret garden '' - carlo collodi \u201e pinokio '' - lucy maud montgomery `` anne of green gables '' - h. ch . 
  andersen , j. i w. grimm various tales - ferenc molnar `` the paul street boys '' - mark twain `` the adventures of tom sawyer '', 
  it 's everyone ( nor , den , fin ) vs sweden and sweden vs dennmark . 
  but it 's nothing even close to hate , it 's just friendly banter, 
  just like cold beetroot soup , but more creamy, 
  for dessert ? 
  we are basically close to our neighbours in various aspects eg . 
  we value punctuality like germans and like to drink once , but good like russians , we are also rather reserved , not trustful and pessimistic . 
  as closest ones i would say are irish , ukrainians , lithuanians , belarusians and slovaks . 
  next circle would be hungarians , czechs , germans or russians, 
  not really . 
  kashubians , silesians , tatars or highlanders may be exceptions , but even then it 's nationa   regional . 
  you can find mutiple quirks between regions , but they are not something big nor important nowdays, 
   northern poland : and fucking boars and other , less annoying things like deers, 
  well many people do n't even like it, 
  poland : used in cars and offices not in homes, 
   ok just to clarify myself . 
  it 's funny to see how many instantly thinking about fancy restaurants when in truth i 'm talking about mass produced fast food and suspicious ingredients from street vendors as well . 
  a very european thing indeed . 
  does n't change anything - making food home is still way cheaper,

  orbit , winterfresh or mayby airwaves ( with orbit leading by huge margin ) as for flavours - slight variations of mint or some fruit for kids . 
  / edit : found short market analysis by kpmg : top 4 : orbit , winterfresh , airwaves ( these 3 are owned by wrigley ) and mentos . 
  they cover over 90 % of polish market . 
  in years 2008-13 the market shrinked on average 5,1 % each year . 
  [ source ( in polish , page 26 ) ] ( https://www.kpmg.com/pl/pl/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/documents/2014/rynek-slodyczy-w-polsce-2014-online-secured.pdf ), 
  go talk with any marketing guy if you think so ; ), 
  poland/hungary/czech republic vs sweden/germany if you want the opposites, 
  so another [ vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trwo1xbv6e&amp;nohtml5=false ) from them as bonus, 
  serbian is just more pop spin on [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvkzyul7ubq&amp;nohtml5=false ) ? 
  plan ahead - pick what you want to see , check out map and how public communication works and plan accordingly . 
  do n't just go to a city with `` ok i 'm here , what can i do now '' . 
  also where possible buy tickets online beforehand not to waste time in queues, 
  there 's no culture of gap year in poland . 
  i first heard it on my english lessons . 
  closest thing to that would be erasmus for students or failed year/not getting accepted to the uni you wanted ( in this case people usualy go to some other uni and just switch when get accepeted where they wanted ), 
   everyone is walking around with these it 's the old people 's attribute here, 
  i do n't have any poll about that , so only personal opinion : both sides are arrogant and show little sign of wanting to cooperate . 
  i would lean bit more towards israel though , the quote ( i do n't remember who said it ) sums it up pretty nicely - `` israel uses rockets to protect it 's people , while palestine uses it 's people to protect their rockets '' . 
  hamas has imo coused lot of problems for palestine in the road to peace . 
  near me : - ~ 50m small grocery store - ~ 400m few dedicated ( bakery/butchers/liquors ) shops and really small open market - ~ 500m small supermarket - ~ 800m big tesco i got car , but do n't use it very often . 
  as for the traditional market - i 'm not really a fan of those , my mom is quite found of them though ( for buying vegetables/fruits ), 
  just ask about a specific city . 
  they are different not only from country to country , but from city to city, 
  well both jurnalism and literature are more of a hobby curses / edit : as oppose of career ones like engeneering or accounting, 
  [ estera fundation ] ( http://fundacjaestera.pl/en/ ) - try asking them, 
  ofc , unless you plan to visit donbass in ukraine , grozny in chechenya ( this one is question mark - something can happen anytime there ) or nagorno-karabakh in azerbaijan, 
  there are dozen of vodka flavours, 
   vodka is not flavoured not really , you got dozen of vodka flavours, 
  they are nuts , but do they support any of those in opposition to official church teachings ? 
  well here it 's limited to `` reasonable '' creationism where science denying does n't happen . 
  there 's no anti-evolutionist movements , no `` big bang is only a theory '' or no young earth ideas, 
  look up [ walter 's world videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/woltersworld/search?query=france] ) on france, 
  i will say this way - regions with extreme religiousness in europe are far less extreme than extreme regions in us . 
  poland is statistically one of the most religious countries on the continent and things like religious car stickers , prayer before meal , reading bible , bible literalism , treating religion seriously etc are rare ( or nonexistant ) and looked down upon, 
  but we do n't have the creationism bullshit , which is nice, 
  there 's also subventions from the state budget when a party gets over a treshhold ( 3 % votes if alone or 6 % if in coalition ) , the more votes party gets the more cash they will have, 
   unless you take two far right nutjobs , most people would be cool . 
  thats true for all nations . 
  normal people do n't really have such problems in europe nowdays,
