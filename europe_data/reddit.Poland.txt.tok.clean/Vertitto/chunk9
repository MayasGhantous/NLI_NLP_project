  it 's english `` v '' , and there 's no `` v '' in polish alphabet, 
  priorities change when you run out of men, 
   the sovjets won the war well kind of , their goal was to get to atlantic and they lost vast ammount of people . 
  in that sense they did n't achieve their goal . 
  it 's a bit lose-win situation, 
   katyn was not done by the germany , even though it might seem so in this video mayby if you do n't listen to the narration during the presentation . 
  there 's no info nor implication who commited the massacre in the vid  ( when details are shown ) ~ most died after the invasion when the country was occupied by germany and soviet union mayby it should be noted for sake of clarity though, 
  eastern part of eu * eastern europe is not even mentioned here, 
  i love such use of charts, 
  balls to the wall . 
  should have joined, 
   i was riding the subway with a russian friend and upon seeing a pregnant girl get on the train , he instinctively gave up his seat . 
  is n't that a standard for public communication everywhere ? 
  do they teach about that on russian history classes or just personal knowledge ? 
  there are dresy/kibole , but no squatting or crap-leather jackets mixed with addidas involved, 
  it 's not a thing here either, 
   in this weekend 's presidential election , andrzej duda astonished observers ( and probably himself ) by defeating incumbent bronislaw komorowski with a populist platform heavy on euro-skepticism . 
  euro-skepticism is n't a major thing that contributed to his win imo, 
  on the other hand eg . 
  poland has debt to pay to `` middleeastern '' countries like eg . 
  turkey or iran who took polish assylum seakers during the world wars ... 
  i would n't count non-slavs out . 
  just take groups that are as similar as possible in reasonable ammounts and make an effort to integrate them to the society, 
   what risks ? 
  demographic differences ( eg race , religion , language ) are ** potential ** risk factors that may lead to tensions . 
  wise thing to do is to eliminate as many of them as possible to minimalize the potential risk of problems . 
  religion is easy pick , especially when the church plays big role in the country, 
  when i think of europe i think of [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/683px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png ) . 
  imo it reflects european chunks very well, 
  if so eg . 
  portugal is east or west ? 
   the biggest part of russia is not in europe well yes , but the administrative , cultural core is in europe . 
  even for many russians russia ends with ural , after that it 's syberia, 
  at least poland stays as it is ; ), 
   asia : russia , belarus , ukraine , latvia , lithuania , estonia , turkey , moldova as asia ? 
  nope , but why to risk having problems . 
  if you can pick people you will help , you may as well try sorting them up so that the risks involed are minimalised, 
  repost from / r/europe to / r/europe ? 
  seriously ? 
   poland people think that we 've got the highest gas prices small correction : think that we ( we as a country ) pay most for russian gas , [ which seems to be correct ] ( http://one-europe.info/eurographics/europe-and-russia-how-much-in-the-gas ) , not that gas prices in poland are higher than in rest of eu, 
   that your countries were occupied by stalin during ww2 if only then, 
   hungarian dish hmm that may be wrong , need some hungarian to say, 
  in general it 's a soup popular everywhere east of germany , there 's lots of variants of it [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borscht ), 
  too bad , it 's ukrainian, 
  polan is planing to take syrian christian families [ source ( in polish ) ] ( http://www.pap.pl/palio/html.run?_instance=cms_www.pap.pl&amp;_pageid=1&amp;s=infopakiet&amp;dz=kraj&amp;idnewscomp=&amp;filename=&amp;idnews=214475&amp;data=&amp;status=biezace&amp;_checksum=-1402071411 ) , for now logistics are being carried out to bring 60 families extracts with ewa kopacz 's ( pm ) lines ( sorry for so-so translation )  today christians , that are being treaded in barbaric ways in syria deserve a christian country , that poland is , which would react fast and help . 
   the decision is very clear . 
  we will start from 60 families . 
  there must be a very precise schedule for activities . 
  we will count on cooperations with local governments and we count to menage it just as we did with ukrainians from donbass . 
   we want people to have a decent life standard and be able to learn polish language along with taking care of their children . 
  now we are looking into what families there are , do they have children or not . 
  the logistc process is carried out as we speak . 
  classical : rachmaninoff , szostakowicz , prokofiev , czajkowski , musorgski , strawi\u0144ski , glinka , borodin , rimsky - korsakov , scriabin , glazunov , netrebko and many more ( posted some of their works [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/377aet/who_are_your_favorite_european_classical_music/crkbkxb?context=3 ) or [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t7zloj39ki ) ) russia is european powerhouse for classical music folk/army songs : obviously [ alexandrov 's ensemble ( aka the red army choir ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj9q7n5e25c&amp;list=pl752c0720a892b263 ),

  i would love if balcerowicz finally made the big step and candidated ( pref if he got to be the pm ) .

   i voted for duda like majority of young people did . 
  i genuinely would love to see stats for that as i ' v got compeltley opposite expirience . 
  on my specialisation it was something around 25:5 in favour of komorowski , only few were declaring to vote for duda . 
  pretty much everyone i know who voted for one of the anti-establishment candidates were planning to vote for komorowski in the 2nd round . 
  i find the voting hilarious - especially with polish commentator we got, 
  eurosceptic towards the eu in general not only the currency . 
  as for currency both candidates were against getting it now, 
  that and he 's not as crazy as some of the other ant-establishment candidates, 
   there 's no money for that magic of infinite debt bag may come in handy for that, 
  one thread is already here http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/374ket/exit_poll_andrzej_duda_wins_the_second_round_of/, 
  he won so democracy works ; ), 
   `` smashed '' pretty even - only 6 % difference . 
  duda got more of the votes that were spread in the 1st round though, 
  it 's all election promisses , i hope non of those get fulfilled, 
  so a war for integration purposes ? 
  qatar so european, 
  it 's probably same as in poland - it 's not recognised as constitution defines marriage as men-women relationship : `` marriage , being a union of a man and a woman , as well as the family , motherhood and parenthood , shall be placed under the protection and care of the republic of poland . '', 
  still not fixed : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36woix/samesex_marriage_across_europe_map_from_todays/crhr80x?context=3, 
   regressing more like staying the same while other go foreward, 
  that depends on what definition you are using . 
  the argument comes from the one i ' v mentioned ( in a big short ) / edit oh the butthurt people inable to understand simple concepts, 
   i ca n't comprehend the level of mental gymnastics needed to say something like that . 
  it 's very straightforward and simple - marriege is a term that describes relation between men and women , that 's all , this is where the argument comes from . 
  / r/travel is specialised place for questions like that also look up [ this channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucfr3sz2t3bdp6cux08b93kq ) , i enjoyed him , he has many good tips,

  hmm illegal suggests that there 's some punishment if done . 
  in this case it 's just not considered marrige . 
  sounds more like unrecognised to me . 
  i wonder what do they mean by unrecognized then, 
  illegal in poland ? 
  it 's unrecognised afaik, 
  the referendum does n't change anything on how people are spending their lives , it just puts a different label on the relation people would be in anyway .
