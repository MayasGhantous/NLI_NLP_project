  not really , we are talking about steorotypes, 
  oh there are many combinations eg : pole and russian/ukrainian/lithuanian ( ukrainian nad lithuanian is way more neutral , but can go to shit depending on people ) serbs and croats/bo \u015bnians / albanians greek and macedonian hungarian and romanian/slovakian swede and dane most countries bordering russia and russians, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/index https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/popular-destinations#wiki_europe https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/search?q=europe&amp;restrict_sr=on [ hostels ] ( http://www.hostelworld.com/ ) [ couchsurfing ] ( https://www.couchsurfing.com/ ), 
  steorotypes are similar to mediterranean ones : laid back , love to party , will die if exposted to negative temperatures/lack of sunlight/snow, 
  as for french , noone in poland knows how to pronounce leroy merlin ending up in dozens of versions , [ few samples ] ( https://youtu.be/kuny6e9henu?t=1m32s ) from a rant about foreign names in polish, 
  ofc but i ' talking about `` averages '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_france https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_the_united_kingdom http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/incometax.htm it 's not us - noone counts vat for personal use here, 
  as for guides it depends - if it 's done by random people they are cool . 
  belarus ' cleanliness is much more charming than 3rd word quality slums of france , spain or italy, 
  there are travel guides or vblogs on yt . 
  belarus is very surprising for most westerners as they imagine poor , dirty , ugly commie block jungle, 
  belarus as ugliest ? 
  oo it 's cities are one if not the cleanest in europe , they are also very neat . 
  on averege they are pretty high in europe imo . 
  rural areas are not so cool though , but thats true for many countries, 
  look up / r/travel . there has been multiple threads like this there, 
   education has nothing to do with that . 
  well it has - it 's gov expenditure after all , just not as big as op thinks, 
  all eu countries are in debt ( [ 2012 eurostat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/eurostat_public_debt_gdp.png ) , [ 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;plugin=1 ) ) . 
  for comparison us has around 80 % and japan 174 % of their gdp ( nominal values are astronomical ) . 
  debt driven economy is what rolls nowdays . 
  what matter is whether country is able to pay them on time . 
  at the pinnicle of greek crisis they were unable to pay teachers iirc look up [ crash course economics : deficits & debts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sucsgvyzi0 ) and [ eli5 threads regarding debt ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/search?q=public+debt&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) bonus for fun : keynes vs. hayek rap battle [ part i ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nertfo-sk ) and [ part ii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtqnarzmtoc ), 
  stable employment ( last year of studies ), 
  look up [ walter 's world yt channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/woltersworld/search?query=central+europe ), 
  pretty wide , do n't really have a favourite gener , just listen what suits my mood : classical like eg . 
  [ prokofiev 's `` war and peace '' sung by anna netrebko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvzqjz6oaii ) or [ dvorak 's `` water goblin '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fidtah3svcu ) or [ rachmaninov 's three russian songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz_co3-34qy ) jazz eg . 
  [ `` visa fr\u00e5n utanmyra '' byjan johansson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pzocvvbehw ) or [ the k\u00d6ln concert by keith jarrett ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_iw1wlzhze ) rock/metal eg . 
  [ iron maiden - brave new world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_fdjdwnygm ) or [ tool - jambi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef0lvn3n12i ) sung poetry mostly kaczmarski eg . 
  [ s\u0105d nad goy\u0105 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdfebp8ifgs ) or [ upadek ikara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4l49lnd5bq ) not a fan of most of electronic , hiphop/rap , reggee or disco though, 
  rather not . 
  it would be big news if some county did it . 
  most what was done is some countries were against forced quotas and the way migrants come/move around europe ( roam freely not registered ), 
  hahahah no , but you can get a handgun toy though, 
   knights of the tutonic order oo quite the opposite , 
  miss universe quality of solution , 
  copy-paste from previous thread : hard to say , i ' v not been looking into it yet - there 's nearly half year till the elections . 
  ask the question around the end of august  bernie us trying to catch up to rest of 1st world . 
  seems ok for me  hilary looks like `` safe populist '' - `` i do n't know anything , got no opinion on anything , but i will make everything better '' . 
  from the little i follow i got no idea why would anyone vote for her  trump it was hilarious at first , now it getting pretty scarry, 
  and premier league, 
  looking at thumbail from your post on / r/russia i would say not steorotypical northen . 
  does n't look like anything specific, 
  to build up on that there 's also [ sarmatism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarmatism#late_medieval_origin.2c_links_to_ancient_history ) as a bonus, 
  / r/norway may be a place where you find answers faster, 
  i do n't think poland is the country opinion of which op is looking for, 
  what country ? 
  it 's barely scratched pretty much in two lines : 1941 - japanese attack pearl harbour 6 and 9.08 1945 dropping nukes on hiroszima and nagasaki , end of ww2 ww2 is convered almost entirely around europe + a bit of north africa, 
  hmm the baltics switching from one to another and the deluge, 
   all of the wars that sweden has had with russia and denmark poland not mentioned ? 
  the question is very bad since you do n't learn much about most other countries , mostly due to time constraints . 
  history is generally taught from your country pov depends what group of countries you are talking about what people usually learn : global scale : start of ww2 in europe happened in poland , holocaust western world : + solidarno\u015b\u0107 events , break of eastern block europe : + partitions of poland , siege of vienna neighbours ( past and present ) : + wars between the states , some alliences general things that i imagine are n't mentioned outside poland : king lines , internal affairs , independence mouvements after partitions , involvement in ww1/2, 
  but at least written polish , unlike english , is in line with what is spoken . 
  so that 's one plus , 
  if so there 's no option for you - start learning ; ), 
  you considered polish ? 
  there are many poles in uk , but damn, 
  it 's very similar everywhere - vocab , grammar , reading and bit of listening/speaking . 
  unless you sign for additional curses or push yourself to learn some language and use it pretty frequently ( traveling , internet and media ) , school alone wo n't do shit , no matter where you study . 
  as for langs required : - english or german ( huge majority has english ) from elementary ( sometimes in kindergarten ) up to specialist curses on university - 2nd lang at junior-high , i could pick from english/german/russian / french ( but since english was the default foreign , it 's the other 3 that were available ) , i picked german - highschool the same story , you pick again ; you can switch or continue the one you had before , i continued german ; also in highschool i had luck getting pretty ambitious group and cool teacher so we did lot of additional stuff ( mostly some weird grammar concepts and fency vocab ) - i had after-school english lessons - made cae certificate midway through my highschool ; - on uni you pick again i studied economy and had to pick one advanced ( where we did economy/finance/accounting vocab ) and 2nd one - i could pick from english/german/russian / french/spanish/swedish . 
  i picked swedish now my english is decent , though it has deteriorated ; did n't get good enough with german or swedish and not using them my brain melted those two together . 
  i will probably sign up for either german or swedish soon, 
   to what degree are people aware of the elections , the process , and candidates ? 
  close to 0 for now . 
  sometimes media will mention it when someone says some dumb thing or an important debate is going on . 
  it 's just mentioning that a debate is happening . 
  average joe does n't know shit about it there will probably be some longer spotlights with brief candidate summaries near the elections and they will probably focus on foreign policies, 
  look up also / r/germany ( english ) and / r/de ( german ), 
  just another superhero, 
  also since there are dozens types of kebab - [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nuekpumo7k ) is what people have in mind hearing kebab in poland, 
  is n't outwards doors the standard due to the safty reasons ? 
  i do n't think i ' v seen many inward doors in poland, 
  hmm there are traffic lights or tunnels / `` pedestrain bridges '' for that, 
  not sure about the details , but when it comes to white arms they can not be disguised as other objects eg . 
  a blade hidden in a umbrella there are some that are banned like brass knuckles , but i do n't know the exact rules . 
  i only know about swords couse i train classical fencing and we use weapons that look like real weapons oppose to their sport counterparts eg [ smallswords ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o0dak6e.jpg ) or [ rapiers & daggers ] ( http://imgur.com/jsdh4mx ), 
   weapons swords do n't need license though ; ) you can carry them freely as you please, 
  gda\u0144sk + sopot + gdynia = tr\u00f3jmiasto ( = tricity or 3city ) , [ map ] ( http://eurohandballpoland2014.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tr%c3%b3jmiasto.jpg ) , [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tricity,_poland ) , sometimes small nearby towns ( rumia , reda , wejherowo and pruszcz gda\u0144ski ) are also counted in it 's one big aglomeration , works like one city - many institutions got their departments spread in the cities ( eg . 
  economy & menagement departments of gda\u0144sk university are in sopot and oceonography department is in gdynia ) , they share public transport so some degree . 
  there 's a saying that you live in gdynia , work in gda\u0144sk and party in sopot . 
  when going for gda\u0144sk as a turist , do n't forget to visit also sopot and gdynia . 
  iirc you can not have open bottle with alcohol in some states - my dad was reminded about this many times while in chicago . 
  what also may surprise you - you need to drive with your lights on all the time , no matter the season or hour, 
  obligatory : - small fire extinguisher , - a warning triangle , additional that you should have ( but you wo n't get finned for not having ) - luminecent vest - med kit , - tow rope , - spare wheel with a lift and a key , - spare light bulbs and fuses those requirements differ from country to country , in some aside from those mentioned you also need eg . 
  wheel chains for winter, 
  most often it 's the officer that comes to you to check your documents ( driving license/insurence ) , sometimes ask to show that you got all the necessary items ( like medical kit , fire extinguisher etc ) . 
  sometimes you are asked to go to the police car - usually when you screw something up or have to blow the breathalyzer . 
  by default you sit and wait for the officer and get the documents ready, 
  most that can be done is [ poland a and b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland_a_and_b ) divide i guess , but it 's rather old division and quite blurry . 
  you could also make a division by `` ethnographic '' critieria where you single out silesia , kashubia , mayby kurpie and highlanders of various kind and rest of poland . 
  but again it 's pretty blurry nowdays . 
  even our muslim tatars are pretty polish, 
  no thx , i would rather not travel back in time , 
  not the most prevelant ones though ( christian/jewish at least ), 
   unfortunately , eastern europeans only accept solidarity if it means we give them money , and we ca n't expect anything at all from the uk not really the case, 
  you can also spend some time on the walter 's world yt channel ( the top 10 i listed ) . 
  he has cool vids regarding many regions, 
  i would drop athens in favour of berlin/prague/krak \u00f3w / vienna . 
  mayby drop barcelona and go to few bennelux cities instead ( since they are very close to each other ) eg . 
  gent , brugge and amsterdam some usefull things : - [ visit europe : top 10 european cities for tourists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buxkytcr8rq ) - [ 10 signs you might be an ugly american tourist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kebjkfloefa ) - [ differences between europe & the us : what you should know before you visit europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd3tms6sdmc ) - [ 10 things that will shock you about europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsbk_yhgq8 ) / edit : spend some time in class , open a map and go country by country ( wikipedia , yt travel promos etc ) to see what each region has to offer - usually americans are very ignorant about europe ( aka europe = only london , paris , barcelona and mayby something from italy ) and you may find some lesser known city/region you would like to visit ( mayby croatia , slovenia and other balkans , mayby baltics + saint petersburg , mayby v4 , mayby the black sea or scandinavia ) .
