  gee , i wonder why ? 
  that 's true , failing to bring the cossack elite into the commonwealth 's fold was probably * the * biggest mistake the commonwealth made ( other than liberum veto 's existence ) . 
  what 's also true is that the commonwealth 's magnates and nobility treated all peasants and serfs like shit , be they ruthenian , polish or lithuanian . 
  bad treatment of the ukrainians and belarusians during the second polish republic was also a thing ( forced polonization , destroying orthodox churches . . etc. ), 
  and bred a lot of the resentment that led to ukrainians going on a genocidal spree against poles in 1943-44 . 
  now that ukraine has turned westward again for the first time in hundreds of years , hopefully we can reconcile and team up because together we can be a great power . 
  nowadays we have people from both countries being obstacles to reconcilations : from ukraine it 's the rising tide of nationalism and upa-worship , and from poland it 's the lingering resentment of the massacres in wo\u0142y\u0144 and galicia during ww2 plus the nationalisic hools and `` dresy '' that are common in former eastern bloc countries . 
  ** ssn : strategies for submarine warfare ( 1996 ) ** follows the missions of uss cheyenne in a future war with china precipitated by china 's invasion of the disputed ** spratly islands ** . 
  it 's tough to pick the # 1 proudest moment but these are definitely the top category : [ russian homage ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fpl.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fho%25c5%2582d_szujskich&amp;edit-text= ) in 1611 , when the captured russian tsar and his brothers was taken to the polish king and paid homage to his might . 
  [ battle of vienna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ) in 1683 , where the polish-german alliance led by the polish king jan sobieski iii saved vienna from the ottomans after a long siege by means of history 's largest cavalry charge . 
  [ battle of warsaw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_%281920%29 ) in 1920 , where the polish army stopped the soviet advance into europe and completely routed the red army . 
  `` poland '' at that time did n't refer to ethnic poles anyways . 
  poland sent like 194 special forces soldiers in the invasion to seize the oil platforms off the coast before they could be blown up . 
  later on , many more soldiers were sent to occupy one of the iraqi districts together with a multinational force made up from over a dozen countries . 
  the idea was that poland needed to send soldiers to iraq and afghanistan to show that it 's a reliable ally in nato . 
  plus since we helped out the americans in thoe cases , one day we could call in for them to return the favor . 
  i want the commonwealth flag ... 
  good , but they should also be willing to use them should the time comes . 
  now that i 'm thinking about it ... poland is getting choppers , czechia is getting choppers , we should convince hungary and slovakia to get choppers too . 
  pool our resources and make them together . 
  we 'd have a visegrad chopper . 
  we could call it the amn-15 karpat . 
  the south remembers . 
  yeah i 've seen this before ; it 's bad ass . 
  today 's military parades should look like this still . 
  instead they look ... slimmer . 
   eastern europe  remote corner of europe  croatia what ? 
  let 's compromise and call it vilno . 
  commonwealth is our only hope . 
  google earth does this . 
  you have to download the program to do it . 
  i am more leaning towards the eu being a confederation instead of a federation . 
  i support a joint foreign policy and intense defense cooperation , common market management , free movement , anti-corruption actions and joint projects ( like infrastructure , research , technology . . etc. ) . 
  i do not support the eu trying to dictate what member states do in their own internal affairs . 
  it pissed me off when media were touting it as a `` miracle . '', 
  no bitch , it 's science and hard work of doctors and nurses . 
  to whom would they give it back to though ? 
  the majority of population was polish , there was a large minority of jews , and lithuanians constituted a small ( ~ 2 % ) minority . 
  nato will come running when it 's too late anyways ; we need to rely on ourselves and just spend that 3 % or more on military . 
  because romanians are bros. 
  it 's a landmark at this point . 
  like disneyland , with its fake reconstructed old town . 
  germany : roads czechia : girls slovakia : mountains ukraine : girls belarus : idk lithuania : shared-history russia : girls, 
  by law , perhaps , but socially i would never be accepted as chinese . 
  europe 's nations are based on ethnicity . 
  if you 're white and move to another european country , you can really easily blend in and be undetectable . 
  someone who looks very different will not have that possibility . 
  it 's really only the nationalists and uninformed that are poland-hating . 
  if the [ hadiach treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_hadiach ) were allowed to play out , i think modern-day ukrainians would remember the commonwealth times fondly . 
  there might have even been a commonwealth today , history having run differently . 
  if western europe does n't want them , ukrainians can come to poland . 
  even in poland there is a [ petition ] ( http://maxkolonko.com/main/mmk/?p=1676 ) to pass an american second amendment-style gun law , with over 100,000 signatures . 
  our neighbors , from my perspective : slovakia : zlaty bazant czech : skoda germany : volkswagen ukraine : antonov belarus : ??? 
  ah yes , modern `` art '', 
  this is like saying that the tokyo metropolitan bureau of transportation has too many asians . 
  when i see things like this i always think to myself that europe already has a rich diverse set of cultures that do n't really need enriching . 
  if anything , they need preservation in the face of the increasingly globalist monoculture . 
  that 's why it really pisses me off when some people try to push holidays like halloween or even thankgiving day , like it 's something that we should also do . 
  when they call it the regressive left , they literally mean it 's regressive . 
   living conditions in the big cities are pretty similar to others in western europe . 
  yeah if you have money . 
  the problem is that wages are very low when compared to w.europe , which is why over 2 million people left the country since eu accession . 
  what 's to stop people from buying pills in neighboring countries and selling them in poland ? 
  not as funny as poland being taken over by its former fief . 
  it 's because muslims , like normal people , want peace throughout the world . 
  the catch is that there can only be peace when everyone is muslim . 
  * cohesion funds from eu that get spent on infrastructure built by companies and consortia from western eu countries . 
  ( so the money comes back ) * opening up of markets to western eu countries so they can sell products on our market ( that are tranported on said infrastructure ) , outcompete and buy out our companies . 
  * opening up labor markets so that young people move to western eu and pay taxes there , screwing up our demographics in the long term . 
  and * we 're * sucking you dry ? 
  do you really think they would leave the eu and return to bombed out syria ? 
  no , they would fight tooth and nail to stay , and start bringing more of their people over . 
  it 's a rather unique thing in the world that we have such a friendship with magyarbros . 
  i wish we had that kind of friendship with ukraine and belarus too . 
  well are n't croats and serbs really the same ? 
  there has been speculation in some polish media that migrants might try to make a route north to ukraine ( either through bulgaria and romania , or on boats across the black sea ) and through poland to germany . 
  if they tried to come through poland , our football hooligans would give them a warm welcome . 
  after that , spain is next . 
  [ this is a trailer for a pretty good documentary about light pollution and its effects on humans . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1ftkf8piu0 ), 
  i do n't even understand how turkey joining the eu is even on the table . 
  turkey is not a country that is culturally european . 
  sure , they have been a presence in european history for a long time , but have never been part of the european cultural sphere and have historically played the role of an `` outside power '' that had territory in europe . 
  if someone tells me that just because turkey has 3 % of its land in europe and that 's enough to be european , then perhaps spain should be considered african for having ceuta and melilla on the african mainland . 
  i want this to happen already , and not a never ending stream of consultations , planning and setting technical requirements . 
  i have heard this guy 's voice many times on what used to be the history channel . 
  it frustrates me when people do that too . 
  having lived there , i can definitely tell you that if you hate people driving in the left lane , driving in the united states will make you go absolutely crazy . 
  you should then be ok with us renaming our eastern regions `` ukraine '' and having `` ukrainian history '' be of those regions . 
  source ? 
  ukraine is a twin we had such a falling out with that we doubt we 'll ever be on family terms with again . 
  so , hungary . 
  yeah , lipka tatars . 
  they 've been here for hundreds of years and are fully assimilated ( unlike muslim communities in western & northern europe ) . 
  they practice a more liberal form of islam that 's been heavily influenced by christianity due to their long history in poland/commonwealth . 
  they 've been complaining that muslim immigrants from arab and north african countries are more conservative and `` enthusiastic '' and are slowly displacing the lipkas ' liberal islam . 
  usa intervened in both world wars and stayed in europe during the cold war in order to prevent the rise of a peer competitor . 
  at this point , szkieletor is an icon of krak\u00f3w in itself .
