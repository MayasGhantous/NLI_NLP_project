   many people that are coming to europe right now are also not authentic refugees  they 're just economic migrants , many probably pushed by war there but definitely not eligible for gaining a refugee status . 
   1 million ukrainian refugees in accordance with the dominant politically correct narrative within the west that conflates refugees with immigrants . 
   if greece does not wish to be part of this solution ( ... ) then we 'll have to discuss with the bulgarians and macedonians '' said szijjarto . 
  oh they want to build a fence on the bulgarian and macedonian borders with greece ? 
  just wait until they start crossing into romania on a boat from turkey via the black sea . 
  free market and capitalism !, 
  well , he was georgian ... 
  then we 'll tax the shit out of german banks and corporations operating in poland , how about that ? 
  let polish companies rise up and take their place . 
  it 's too bad czechs do n't like poles as much as poles like czechs . 
  you really think we can form a single country with ukrainians ? 
  remember what happened last time ? 
  it would be nice if it could happen ; we 'd have a larger population than france and similar to germany , and we 'd have a powerful military-industrial complex . 
  but it would be like forcing cats and dogs to live together . 
   there are no meaningful left wing media in poland . 
  thank god for that ; the last thing we need is new leftism in poland so they can start turning the country into the volatile multikulti mixture that exists in the rich west . 
  that 's what 350 years under the russian boot does to a country . 
  the eu was never about unity . 
  originally it was about containing the franco-german competition , then it was about containing a reunified germany , and now it 's about serving rich eu economies ' interests . 
  german elites would like poland to experience the wonders of multiculturalism too , and for that an amenable government and media is necessary in order to propagate new left ideologies and self-flagellating attitudes to leave society meek and impotent . 
  it 's just some `` brotherly help '' . 
  absolutely haram . 
  resistance is futile , you will be polonized . 
  seems like he went to london expecting it to be an english city when it 's actually not anymore . 
  i would be down for a game of civ v. 
  no one picks on eesti-chan and gets away with it , right ? 
  it 's because having kids is too expensive and gets in the ways of careers . 
  another way to ramp up the pressure . 
  poland just finished its lng terminal and can use it to supplant russian gas in central europe . 
  blockading the baltic would stop lng shipments to poland . 
  poland has nsm anti-ship missiles stationed on its coast . 
  in case of hostility , russia would have to say goodbye to a huge chunk of its baltic fleet . 
  lmao they would never buy from poland , out of spite if not anything else . 
  [ the two safest countries in the world are also some of the most homogenous ... ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ ), 
  everyone east of the oder-niesse is a second-rate european . 
  [ alarming intensifies ], 
  i think a show that 's like game of thrones , but set in the polish-lithuanian commonwealth would be pretty cool . 
  there would be a lot of political intrigue between powerful magnate and noble families , from poland , lithuania and ruthenia , plus characters and envoys from neighboring countries . 
  too poor for clean energy , gib moni pls . 
  the other german dude got the joke ; clearly you did not . . you did start to sound a bit defensive there though ... 
  asean has more people than the eu and that gap will widen by a lot . 
  if the west continues to hand out its technological advantage in return for short term financial gain , we 'll end up in a situation where we are outnumbered and without the tech advantage . 
  yeah instead we 'll have a franco-turkish-japanese-german vs polish bloc and america war ... 
   in macedonia alexander the great kek, 
  that 's some half-life 2 shit right there . 
  same , i wash them by hand . 
  wan na take bets for how long till they jump to germany ? 
  a feminist converting to islam is like a chicken converting to kfc . 
  makes sense , reddit is an english-language and american website . 
  we need to fuse saiyan-style with ukraine for that to happen . 
  poland , turkey and japan : fucking russia up from three sides ... 
  but you better stay out of se europe . 
  friedman 's predictions slowly coming true ? ... 
  it 's because finland put its airspace so close to russia ; maybe you could move it a bit to make them feel better . 
  2 million poles moved out since we joined the eu in 2004 . 
  ** 2 million ** that 's 5 % of the population . 
  and more want to leave . 
  meanwhile , because we 're in schengen , it 's more difficult for us to have a liberal visa regime with ukraine , belarus and russia . 
   it is on us to accept them . 
  yes , ** however ** that is on the condition that they integrate themselves into our culture . 
  so if you want to move to and live in poland , you can be accepted as long as you become polish . 
  how can a person expect to move to a different society and be accepted as one of them if they do n't align themselves with that society 's traits and beliefs ? 
  really , if you do that , you 're imposing your culture and beliefs on the host society ; how can you expect them to like that ? 
  a lot of these people coming into europe are coming here not to live as europeans and become part of our cultural sphere , but to access a higher standard of living . 
  that 's it . 
  they do n't love europe for its values or culture ; they love europe for its advanced economy . 
  many of them downright dislike , or even hate our culture , but the quality of life is just too good to give up in order to live somewhere where the people share your values . 
  careful , that 's not kosher thinking . 
  more visible political , military and economic cooperation , plus an emphasis on historically good polish-romanian ties in the media and schools . 
  for example , poland and romania had a military alliance in the interwar period , and they actually offered to help , unlike * cough * some allies . 
  how is that racist ? 
  poland and romania are growing incessantly . 
  both countries are projected to maintain solid growth rates of more than 3 % for the next several years . 
  when a man has money , he can provide stability and receives love ... 
  no , they just find our security concerns a matter of secondary importance . 
  their distance to russia allows them to be more complacent , at our expense . 
  now just waiting on slovakia so we can into visegrad galactic empire . 
  #prayfordiesel #policedoghero #dogheaven #peoplewhousetoomanyhashtags #onlineactivismdoesntdoanything, 
  i just think they do n't want the demographics of their country changed permanently , especially when it 's kind of forced by outside forces . 
  it would show polish troops if it was about the battle of daugavpils , which it is n't . 
  it 's about the latvian riflemen who served as part of the russian imperial army and fought against the germany army during ww1 . 
  on a side-note , it would be pretty damn cool if there was a joint polish-latvian production about the battle of daugavpils . 
  he 's probably in germany . 
  poland can accept western european refugees . 
  true . 
  in that case we were n't enemies though ; just france being an unreliable ally . 
  poland and france have always found themselves on the same side in every war they were both in , so we have a good history there . 
  i feel like le pen just got handed the presidency . 
  [ meanwhile , poland and romania grow ... ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/13/centraleurope-economy-gdp-idusl8n1382jk20151113 ), 
  so many to choose from , depending on what you like . 
  for historical fiction , check out sienkiewicz 's trilogy , the teutonic knights or quo vadis . 
  fantasy , sapkowski 's witcher series or dukaj 's l\u00f3d . 
  for science fiction , stanislaw lem 's solaris or his master 's voice . 
  those are just the ones i really like . 
  other great books include prus ' s the doll , \u017beromski 's coming spring , reymont 's the peasants , and more . 
  the baltic sea is a guy taking a piss . 
  if turkey got into the eu , then the eu would have land borders with syria , iraq , [ isis ] , and iran . 
  no wonder russia wants a piece of that . 
  germany should never again have control of that region . 
  it would completely undermine poland 's defense westward .
