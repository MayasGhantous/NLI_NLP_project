  i am not trying to conradict biology , only woman can abort a pregnancy in the model i presented . 
   it is not emotional , it was simply a clarification since you seemed to be unclear about my position . 
  clarification - the action of making a statement or situation less confused and more comprehensible . 
  https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/clarification how is `` you must not '' more comprehensible ? 
   it 's the rights of a human being . 
  what right is it , can you name exactly what right did you mean ? 
  i discussed it already , giving a counterexample of a sperm bank . 
  the child has no claim to father 's money in this example , if mother decides to get sperm from this place . 
  should we ban sperm banks ? 
   you also seem upset that biology gives women an option that men do n't have . 
  i am not upset , i wanted to discuss a solution . 
  and i do acknowledge it that is why i fully support women to do whatever they want with their bodies . 
  you talk about emotions in here , just look at your post :  you can not , you must not , and you should not . 
  clear ? 
  this is an emotional one , trying to push the idea just because . 
  look anywhere in this thread and try to find anything close in my posts . 
   what you 're arguing is that a man should be able to sign away the child 's rights . 
  hmm not really , but this is sematics mostly . 
  in this solution man should be able to reject the right for foetus and whatever ( i am dont know how to put it in more delicate manner ) grows from it . 
   you can not , you must not , and you should not . 
  clear ? 
  w-what is this , an argument ? 
   but they do , due to biology , have the ability to abort the pregnancy . 
  men do not . 
  that is why i am not even implying man should have a right to interfere with woman 's body . 
  did you even read my first post ? 
   you can not legally reject your responsibilities and the child 's rights . 
  yes you can not , this is he reason of this post . 
   if you are not ready to take the responsibility for a child , do not have sex . 
  by this logic polish law for abortion is the best one possible . 
  poland currently allows to terminate pregnancy in 3 cases : rape , severe deformation of foetus , risk for mother 's life . 
   woman assumes the risk of getting pregnant + going through abortion or going through pregnancy and giving birth + financially supporting the child . 
  indeed , that is why many people support abortion . 
  woman has aditional 9 months burden . 
  this is a disproportion to man . 
   men assume the risk of getting the woman pregnant and having to financially support the child . 
  indeed , that is why in my orginal post said that women has a final decission . 
  she has additional 3 weeks to decide and man is jointly financially responsible for her lost wage and full recovery including psychiatrist . 
  is it even a queston in this context ? 
  i never said otherwise , woman has 3 more weeks to decide and she can terminate pregnancy any time during 12 weeks . 
  yes it does . 
  situation : woman decides to have a baby by getting sperm from a sperm bank . 
  does this child have a right to have both parents , because by logic it does . 
  yes i do agree and this is the reason both partners should share the risk . 
  i do agree . 
   the woman ca n't just walk away , she has to choose either abortion or giving birth , and her decision making ability is arguably already being influenced by pregnancy hormones . 
  you ca n't make it on pregnancy hormones . 
  for example if pregnant woman kills a person she wont get out of jail by putting the blame on hormones . 
  if a man rapes a woman it is n't because he has got a high testosterone , but because he is a criminal . 
   you want to make `` legal abortion '' available for men , why should i then talk about women ? 
  w-what ? 
  i mean those are very realte problems , dont you think ? 
   you make sure that your sex partner does n't get pregnant . 
  why ? 
  i mean do you assume that this `` sex-partner '' is ( i dont know how to put it in an easy way ) menally challenged ? 
  do you want only one person to tak responsibility for both partners ? 
   you do n't want to give birth ? 
  you make sure that you do n't become pregnant . 
  ok , so when you get ** raped ** it is your fault ? 
  or what ? 
   what price do you put on her psyche ? 
  so man 's phychic problem arent a thing , y-yes ? 
   get a vasectomy and use condoms again , why do you want to force anticonception only for men , you dont mention women part in that . 
  i mean they are both responsible , arent they ? 
  i agree for men and women share costs of everything that comes out of abortion including her lost paycheque during and after they procedure and her health complications . 
  yeah this is what i meant , i might not have explained it well enough . 
  well , frankly abortion doesnt really help future children . 
  i dont think that this is the ultimate goal in here . 
  because it seems that by this login you do . 
  the child by your logic has a right to both parents ' yet woman who uses sperm bank strips this child from this right . 
  so you basically say that women who use sperm donor and raise childern without a father are making the child suffer ? 
  it 's cute how you insult the person you reply to . 
  momey is an impprtant factor , but things like slowin down future careers for both man and woman plays a crucial role . 
  replying it is an issue of equality , it is both parents ' baby but only one has a way out . 
  but it isnt like i try to prove the point or anything , i really hoped for a discussion in here, 
  not cool, 
  no , woman has a choice , she decides in the end . 
  she makes the only and the final decission about her body . 
  man decides only about his ( legal ) part . 
  again , did you even read my comment or you just wanted to post few `` wtfs '' in the conversation ? 
  you did n't even read my comment , did you ? 
  i support abortion for women , i even want to ** extend it ** beyond this level . 
  i do agree , but question is why countries with abortion righs do n't you have legal abortion for men ? 
  i mean we fight for equality in here and i do support equality . 
  to simplify . 
  in this concept man has 10 weeks to reject the right to the future baby ( along with alimonies ) and woman has 12 weeks to abort it . 
  so she has 2 weeks to decide if she wants to be single mother . 
  we cant allow only women to have an option in here . 
  there is anticonception for both genders avalible , both partners might have fucked up . 
  it 's either gender equality or not , the baby is both parents ' . 
  is this real world or just fanta sea ? 
  you can have tusk , ukraine . 
  good luck with him . 
  babushkas are frequenlty becoming a rare species tbh , i feel they gon na be claimed endangered soon, 
  at first i thought you were referring to poles . 
  brits seem to be integrating well into polish community back there in the uk . 
  warsaw is in eastern polan tbh, 
  i checked it again , and yeah about 1/3 was born in poland , about the same in russia especially those early ones , the newest werent though . 
  very sad indeed , especially when he was born in prewar poland like almost all israeli pm 's afaik , but how is it europe ? 
  is poland a mexico of europe ?
