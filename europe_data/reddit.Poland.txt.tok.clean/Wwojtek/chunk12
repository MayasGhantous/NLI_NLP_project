  it is is n't really fair if you asked me . 
  again , no problem with europeans . 
  those africans i have nothing in common with . 
  polish goverment paid money for greece , noone said a word . 
  i think ** your ** mentality is what is preventing europe from being a united continent . 
  you are trying to force others to do something you want them to do . 
  we could do somehting in 2 ways , either willingly ( unite not as artificial union of governments but union of people ) ** or ** by force - you chose ** the latter ** . 
  so one more time , how many african refugees did you take to your house ? 
  we can , but we can also give it to polish children , which i 'd prefer . 
  btw if you are so enthusiastic about them , how many have you accepted already into your house ? 
  xd but seriously , i hoped for some discussion . 
  can you do it somewhere else , plx ? 
  i am afraid you 'd need to commit suddoku after watching it, 
  world is not all according to the rules , after crossing the border everyting can happen . 
  the reason is simple , ukraine is afriad that their citizens will run away from the country . 
  they know what happened to poland in 2004 when we entered eu . 
  ehh kurwa , feels bad man, 
  is this a real life ? 
  not at all . 
  being liberal here means that you are in opposition to socialism . 
  being leftie means you support additional rights for homosexuals . 
   he was `` radicalised '' in eastern europe during a period of escalating tension between russia and his homeland in 2012 and 2013 . 
  such is life in eastern europe . 
  that is why again you need to remember to invest in eastern poland . 
  one of the reasons i do n't support multiculti is that i think european culture is superior to others in some issues , like this one . 
  those are accurate ? 
  said german scary . 
  oh come on , this i wouldnt believe in . 
  the source could be better . 
  why do germans are ready to pick refugees over their own citizens ? 
  things got out of hand a while ago but they still continue this policy . 
  so the reasoning is that women feel unconfortable ? 
  brits must have skipped orwell during learning course . 
  turkey goes shit [ europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krzhpoeoxqq ) to blame reddit gave erdo\u011fan a bad name, 
  cameron wont allow it . 
  honestly , is duolingo any good ? 
  i mean can you reach like a2 level with it ? 
  [ silly ] ( https://metricpioneer.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/measure-compare1.jpg ) you say . 
  color us poor, 
  this us how border fence should look like . 
  tatars here are just poles that go to different church as far as we are concerned . 
  no it isnt but it creates a hell of butthurt . 
  remember that just more than 25 years ago we were both commie countries . 
  imagine predictions made 35 years ago . 
  i hope this chart ends somewhere in the space . 
  if we dont go to the space during my lifetime i will be pissed . 
  i hope we can get a prize for that . 
  feels good to be the best . 
  [ classic ] ( http://youtu.be/g_jutiksf1y ), 
  soo / pol / was right all this time . 
  / s why did n't we [ listen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mquulbwtkns ) ? 
  nope , he is just saying that this is no news . 
  you know russia could have been saudi arabia looking at the amout of resources they have ? 
  we dont have that . 
  dont letnthatbcloud your judgement . 
  countries take all thy can from thir geopolitical position , we have eu , russia has resources . 
  i would trade eu for amout of resources that russia has . 
  also ihdi is just of the stats , i wouldnt base my whole argument on that , because it might cloud my judgement . 
  meaning donbass ? 
  government represents the country . 
  is he in our government ? 
  i did n't know , i must have slipped it in today 's press . 
  and nothing of value was lost . 
  i am about to , since your vice chancellor represents your country 's policies and you posted article from june . 
  i think `` was '' is a keyword here . 
  what do you mean by comparable levels of development ? 
  is israel at comparable level of development with netherlands ? 
  cold, 
  are you seriously comparing italy in 96 to poland in 96 ? 
  we had to rebuilt the country from almost nothing at this time . 
  we are still rebuilding . 
  as i said above and in other replies . 
  it would force us to fire people and buy energy from the west for bigger prices . 
  eu is being a dick since they do n't care about our situation at all . 
  we are n't too , but this decission is too quick for us . 
  we too need time to build new infrastructure . 
  join russia they said , it will be fun they said . 
  sure thing they are building nuclear infrastucture that will enpower like 2 % of their country , we are in a progess of building one for 16 % . 
  also china should do more , since they pollute enviorment few times more even if you compared with taking population as a criterium . 
  there is nothing like central europe , just people who want to join germany and austria into shit countries in eastern europe ( by making silly wikipedia pages ) to make them feel better . 
  it is a sort of web joke , dont analise it too much . 
  shhh, 
  sure , dont worry about us . 
  worry about china first . 
  nah , i asked you for you to justify your qestion , since it is pointless right now . 
  i must have been a quite a pretty poster if he likes it that much . 
  why do you care ? 
  those are the rules , why are you to question it . 
  it is not your faith i presume , not your business . 
  make your own church with women lesbian priests if you like noone forbids you from it . 
  shit , it is not what they taught me on the history lesson . 
  germany had nuclear power plants and turned it off because of muh econazism . 
  you decided to have high price . 
  duda vetoed because we too are unable to fulfill this limit . 
  also as i said before eu isnt th problem china and us are . 
  maybe your country whould be an example and fulfill our part of the co2 limit if you care about it this much . 
  what milion people dying ? 
  are we on the verge of mass destruction ? 
  if this is the case , we must destroy the country that pollute the most . 
  meaning china .
