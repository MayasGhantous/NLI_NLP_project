  i find it laughable how they yap on about muslim takeover of the country while the number of immigrants is still very long way from even approaching 1 % . 
  last time i 've seen people my age and younger ( late teens , early 20s ) tend to be surprisingly right wing recently . 
   only after this one plane crash things calmed down a bit . 
  cheer up . 
  all signs point the remaining twin will be back in power next election . 
  i hate this country sometimes . 
  this shows ridiculously privileged position of clergy in poland . 
  everyone else would shut up because they know saying shit like that would get them lynched to the applause of entire country . 
  church meanwhile knows that it has so many lap dogs in society , media and politics that they forget to think about what they say . 
  although at this point they cross even that line and even former supporters of church are backing away as more quotes like that one surface . 
  i hope this knocks them down a peg or twelve . 
  do n't tell me express did n't claim that already . 
   as private schools are activly making it hard for them to attend their schools . 
  should n't that be normal ? 
  if you have more valid applicants than places , ones with better grades get in . 
  or am i missing something ? 
   kremlin initiated economic war with ukraine : suddenly [ 1 ] ukraine has to pay $ 800mil in advance for gas or delivery will be stopped ( apparently it 's a retaliation for ukraine 's movement towards eu ) ; amazing how blatant putin can get with fucking with other countries affairs . 
  or madagascar, 
   we will see . 
  poland should first join the eu before saying such things . 
  we did . 
  good job on research . 
  also , where did i claim poland is a superpower ? 
  i seem to be unable to go as deep between the lines of my own writing as you are . 
  no place for logic here . 
   greece is now the # 1 strategic energy pillar also a # 1 strategic money sink debted into shit relying on other countries to not go bankrupt face it eu 's got your balls and you can only hope they do n't lock them away . 
   never allowed to enter the eu , which at this point they should not even bother wasting their time to even try . 
  to be honest that 's mostly due greece blocking any attempts . 
  awful suggestion . 
  albanian ? 
  independent states should n't have other countries in their name . 
  makes them sound like colony . 
  i loved the `` revolution in church , pope to admit that sex exists '' . 
  and our dead pres loved it past the point of logic . 
   james blunt is surprisingly funny . 
  nation is stunned . 
  did n't you see him on buzzcocks few years back ? 
  dude can really make fun of himself . 
  he 's probably spinning in his grave . 
  jim jeffries said it best . 
  `` her realistic picture would just be some bones covered in cum '' . 
   man assaulted with mackerel . 
  was the perpetrator a small fast-talking guy from boston ? 
  poland reporting with identical proverb as well . 
  this is one for the more oblivious to reality crowd . 
  invite hungarians , they got fucking eviscerated against netherlands . 
  ** poland ** * in warsaw there 's referendum today asking if we want to get rid of our current mayor ( hold an early election to be precise ) . 
  it 's actually interesting how it will turn out , since her camp has fucked the campaign up quite thoroughly . 
  * we got our own pedophile priest scandal . 
  although it 's shared with dominican republic since that 's where the molestation has been going on . 
  it 's been going on for some time , but it gained steam after one archbishop said pedophilia is to be faulted on divorcing parents , since it makes the child `` look for love in other places , become lost and lure others ( priests to be precise ) '' . 
  his idea of parental love seems to come from / r/iama . 
  he later apologized for this `` slip of a tongue '' . 
  * our football team has officially lost any chance of qualifying for world cup . 
  * in a throwback to the early days of long distance running , a man died after crossing the finish line of a public 10k run in warsaw . 
  well , so far we do n't yet have the cartel problem , but everything is on the table . 
  does that mean they 'll have an institute responsible for watching porn and checking whether it 's compatible with russian standards ? 
  brb , preparing resume . 
  that 's it . 
  i 'm done complaining about 9zl ( 2.20 $ ) beer in warsaw . 
   we 've not always been the very best of neighbors to them there 's an understatement of the century . 
  yes , on the internet we are brazilians of europe . 
  more like he saw a bunch of desperate fighty people and thought `` hey , might as well use them '' . 
  weird , i always thought that for someone from outside poland they would be boring and cliched . 
   berlusconi has announced he will ask for social work in lieu of house arrest since his age legally exempts him from serving his sentence in prison . 
  he could potentially be assigned to work for a charitable organization . 
  in other news , a new charity formed in italy , focusing on helping teenage girls realize their dreams of becoming strippers . 
   a bacon delivery truck accidentaly spilled half a ton of bacon over a man . 
  he was hospitalized , but survived . 
  i just found out how i want to die . 
   instead of seeing this as a cautionary tale of the dark side of alcohol , estonians around the country make a mockery of this incident . 
  the irony is just too delicious i guess . 
  weird , in warsaw people either do n't care or want her out from what i see . 
  which should keep her in due to low turnout . 
  ** poland ** * in warsaw there is campaign for referendum over whether to let go of current president ( mayor ) ( she is from current ruling party ) . 
  large clusterfuck happened over both sides using symbols of warsaw uprising in their campaigns . 
  * lech walesa celebrates 70th birthday . 
  also biographical film about him was released . 
  * two opposing teams investigating 2010 plane crash that killed lech kaczynski ( one official and backed by goverment , one led by opposition believing it was assassination ) argue over which one is legitimate . 
  accusations of shit-stirring and collaborating with putin galore . 
  all in all typical whining over shit that happened long ago and will lead us nowhere , but somehow still manages to capture and divide the whole fucking country . 
  were there any murders linked to them , but with no solid proof ? 
  because you got your jimmies rustled ? 
  bitch please . 
  because if people think he will just ban on demand for no reason he should n't be a mod . 
  got ta push the narrative somehow . 
  drones are more expendable than people . 
  we should be fine . 
  great . 
  let go of those that want a living so only ones sent to blow shit up will stay . 
    how fast has eastern europe forgotten for what the previous generation fought so much . 
  like during siege of vienna ? 
  we remember . 
   about 100 polish citizens are living in mariupol in east ukraine . 
  some of them ask for evacuation since months . 
  do you even read, 
  i wonder if they 're doing this knowing it will tank corbyn even more . 
  knowing cameron he will count `` go to germany , they said they will welcome you with open arms '' as a similar statement . 
  judging by the delays it does . 
   they lost the last time precisely because they did n't go on the offensive early on .
