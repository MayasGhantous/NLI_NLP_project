  he is not our hero . 
  no country should have his statue , since he is not a person worth commemorating . 
  yup , tommorow we will be seeing headlines like `` eu along with d.tusk want to strip us from our independence '', 
  but he talks about changes and those bills were not even offically published yet . 
  i do support current protests , but it seems this guy just bashes us without knowing what is happening . 
  those bills are going to be vetoed anyway . 
  what the fug is his problem ? 
  sauna culture created this country . 
  best wishes, 
  we do n't leave monuments , just feels,

  there are hundreads of statues like this on polish soil placed outside cementaries . 
   for a couple years idk how about you , but i am not happy russians are poorer . 
  those sanctions should stay as long as russian agression takes place . 
  i hope those couple years are enough . 
  poles just want safe europe , especially safe eastern europe , we are tired of wars here . 
  so am i , what about it ? 
  i support the fight for historical correctness , do n't you ? 
   we might as well buy as cheap as possible the problem with russian gas is that although the price for it is low , the cost of it might be very high , which was proven by ukrainian conflict . 
   we either buy oil and gas from russia , or we dont . 
  no , we can also buy some of it . 
  diversify , as i said before . 
  nord stream 2 means increasing gas dependency on russia . 
  we should diversify . 
  with only kukiz they ca n't . 
  pis needs to have 60 % votes in presence of half of the mps to overrule the veto in lower chamber ( sejm ) . 
  sejm has 460 mps . 
  let 's say everyone will come to vote . 
  [ parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sejm ) that will support the veto : civic platform + modern + union of european democrats + polish people 's party 136 + 27 + 15 + 4 = 182 - will most like vote against overruling . 
  182/460 = 39,5 % and we need 185 mps to exceed this 60 % pis requires , which makes 185 mps 185/460 = 40,2 % so we need 3 mps to support the veto - in last vote [ 3 non-attached mps ] ( http://sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/agent.xsp?symbol=glosowania&amp;nrkadencji=8&amp;nrposiedzenia=46&amp;nrglosowania=87 ) voted against the bill , 1 abstained , 2 mps in republicans abstained - that makes 6 while we need 3 . 
  so chances this veto will be overruled are rather slim ( but it is possible - yes ) . 
  also i do n't think kukiz will vote to overrule this veto , since 27 of his mps abstained and 3 voted against in last vote . 
  ** edit : ** kukiz posted on fb he is happy duda vetoed this bill , so this basically ends this dicussion . 
  guys can i read more about those high speed rail plans ?

  if this is an annexation bring your wages with you, 
  so israel is europe now ? 
  increasing depenency on russian gas is imho very harmful for eu . 
  we should diversify as much as we can , because although the price for russian gas is low the cost of it might be very high - ukraine conflict showed us how this dependency ends . 
  those are might be future anschluss territories, 
  stop being so racis / s being a neo nazi is what you have in your heart , not the way you are born . 
  everyone know it . 
  hungarians are n't bordering russia in any way , they are not as frightened by green men as we are . 
  we will see if this gas feom russia is really cheaper , taking into consideration all impact it is going to have on hungary . 
  anyway , if hungarias think it is a good idea , well it is their decission .

  president donald trump will attend a summit of the three seas initiative in poland on thursday that his hosts hope will boost economic ties between the united states and the ex-communist countries of central and eastern europe . 
  here are some facts about the three seas initiative . 
  - the three seas initiative is a joint polish-croatian project , launched in 2016 , with the aim of strengthening trade , infrastructure , energy and political co-operation among countries bordering the adriatic , the baltic and the black sea . 
  - the following 12 countries are part of the initiative : poland , hungary , czech republic , slovakia , romania , bulgaria , lithuania , estonia , latvia , croatia , slovenia and austria . 
  - most of the 12 countries were in the soviet sphere of influence after world war two until 1989 and more than half of those joined the european union in 2004 . 
  nearly all are heavily reliant on russian gas and oil imports . 
  - trump plans to promote u.s. natural gas exports as part of his new `` energy dominance '' policy while attending the summit . 
  - ten of the 12 countries have confirmed attendance at the summit . 
  the presidents of the czech republic and austria will be absent . 
  - poland , the eu 's largest eastern economy , has constructed a lng terminal on its baltic coast and is eyeing potential exports of the imported gas to other countries in the region . 
  they may bash us from time to time for asking them to do something .
