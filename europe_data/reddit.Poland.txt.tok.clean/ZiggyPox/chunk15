  stefan michnnik link is empty ... 
  that 's sexist , m8 . 
  so why not just to call it `` english '' anyway ? 
  criticism = racism here unless you use well balanced words and you hide your personal feelings . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_french_words_of_germanic_origin we have been mixing our languages for long , long time ... sooo , yeah , english uses some words that originate from french , but it is not french that works as our modern lingua franca . 
  it used to , but not anymore . 
  is this a challenge ? 
  prison labor is very expensice . 
  not only you have to put more money to keep one inmate but also the work she/he is doing is n't going to cover that extra cost , is low quaility and risky . 
  that 's pure genius . 
  if we would follow your plan we would end with bunch of violent thugs , now with surplus of time and energy to be violent and thuggish aroung the block . 
  recipe for mayhem ... oh yeah . . that nick . . 
  `` adorably cute '' is an interesting choice of words . 
  but they have . . um . . reasons for that . 
  well , it is mostly an excuse just to be dicks , but still . 
  well , my grandpa used to shoot at your upa soldiers but now he is dead just as the people he used to shoot at . 
  so i think we can be friends . 
  she is one of these people with great plan that in halfway through will reach into your pocket because somehow there were n't enought money to found all these wonders . 
  a person with an idea but without the plan . 
  dunno , maybe turn shit-a-load of these intermodal containers into houses ? 
  there allready tools for making them beside the fact we have allready shitload of them . 
  there is any power in being humanitarian ? 
  i thought that being humanitarian is a gesture of good will backed by surplus of resources or sacrifices , where one sooner or later runs out and the other one can be shared not beyong point of slaving yourself for the benefit of others . 
  i do n't get that superpower part ... 
  and who would rule that commonwealth ? 
  all the powers in power right now in poland are thiefs that robbed poland in 89 during system transformation . 
  `` poland can not into space '' is an inside cover job !, 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  until commonissaries show up to shoot down dissidents . 
  i do n't mind change by evolution of my own culture , but i want to choose the direction . 
  sounds like a fun place to party . 
  maybe it was her crane . 
  [ yeah , we are hardcore like that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_army_oaths ), 
  imagine shuffling snow off that roof ... 
  you have to proclaim an oath of loyalty when you are joing armed forces . 
  wow ... my father , as a soldier , would turn that `` victim '' into a * victim * and for everyday he is a nice guy ... how it all turned out for your parents ? 
  did they moved eventually ? 
  yeah , this is true . 
  seriously , i 'm not mad at these people but rather the way we are handling all that multiculturalism and not only multiculturalism . 
  every radical npd member and every extremist islamist is not only fault of given personal , but also ours as a nation . 
  yeah , to be honest we could do little bit more , as we are quite big country , but we should be allowed to do it our way . 
  to many people that should n't reach germany are allready there . 
  let those in dire need stay , everyone else should be send back ? 
  if someone is eu citizen it 's different , d'oh . 
  refugees are not the same as immigrants , if refugees were all that we would have to face this would n't be that much of a problem , beside our lenient reaction toward some of their actions . 
  as for the banks heh . . talk about our own cancer that we let grow on our own flesh ... 
  [ if you like it that way ] ( http://www.contractordoctors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hand_money_burning.jpg ), 
  this you can say about every polish skinheads and blockers living in social flats , yet we are going hard on them and punishment for their crimes is harsh . 
  there should be no free pas for being brown . 
  when they were leaving poland i 've heard they were selling bullets in buckets ... 
  i want to believe . 
  cool . 
  can i have the same list about our european politicians ? 
  i 've heard bacon is trending . 
  bacause in playing friends team effort is most important . 
  oh yeah , people as a * mass * have bad taste , and people do n't like to be reminded that . 
  as you said , there is demand for these things , these things are selling . 
  hell , almost every wedding in western wolrd is made in such style . 
  but as i said , people get rustled when you remind them that as you can see my first comment is now at negative votes hahaha . 
  there is whole idea of `` kitsch '' that fascinates me . 
  look at this thing : https://shareandconnect.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/terracottawarriors_212_05.jpg let me copy description : sword with inlaid openwork hilt in 770 -- 476 bce . 
  excavated at taigongmiao village , yangjiagou in baoji , shaanxi , 1978 people would say it is beautiful antique . 
  what they would say about the same hilt but made out of plastic , injection moulded , with plastic gems and 5 $ price tag ? 
  it would * look * the same but it would be * tacky * to have , to bring home . 
  i could go on but it seems i already rustled some people . 
  well , i * do * have fundation of art history education that span over like ... 8 years ? 
  buth in my uni and before that as a part of my mandatory curriculum . 
  and i had many clients throught these years and , funny , some of them did brought auction catalogues as a reference material of what they want . 
  personal experience as a painter/designer . 
  i have only profanities left to yell ... 
  [ i used to be a patient man like you , untill i took geopolitical situation to the ~ ~ knee ~ ~ heart ] ( https://thenib.com/this-is-not-fine ), 
  i like to be honest with yourself . 
  you know the moment in the life when you have to choose , to be a human being dissatisfied or a pig satisfied ? 
  i have fucked up somewhere and now i 'm dissatisfied pig . 
  you mean , inferiority complex ? 
  you know , i think that in the middle in that vault there is athena . 
  i believe most people are aware of their shortcomings but they repress this knowledge while still trying to compensating themselfes in various ways ... thus here we have athena . 
  i see 2 more frescos on the left and right but they are so distorted that i ca n't tell what is on them . 
  * `` he is right !, 
  '' * says australian frog . 
  you know what is fascinating ? 
  the aesthetic taste . 
  if you ask * average european * what he wants he will point at this picture and say * `` this '' * . 
  tacky gold , pseudo antique and rococo furniture , crystals , * candles * . 
  * `` i want it , it looks rich '' * they will say . 
  they will laught at anyone that has stuff like that , but if given chance they will take it . 
  and noone will be even able to name 3 of these elements . 
  * `` oh , what a nice painting there , it must be expensive '' * ... 
  it 's goddamn fresco di sotto in s\u00f9 . 
  those fancy legs on that chair ? 
  these are cabriole legs . 
  and these engaged columns ? 
  these things has like 10 parts that can be named separately if you want to be pompatous and verbally onanize yourself . 
  the thing is not trump nor averge european can say why it is * good * taste or * bad * taste , they will point you to google picture and say * `` this '' * and in this way he really is n't that different from us . 
  it 's just that the thing in which he is similar to us is n't the best of human traits . 
  end of rant . 
  edit : you just all got rustled i see . 
  i also like to laught at limousine liberal promoting quasi-communism . 
  good thing these are * not * banned on facebook , 
  just say it , you are undercover russian .
