  we still love you and i 'm sure it will all turn aaaaw right . 
  i still believe that brexit will be kept in eternal limbo . 
  yep , it was the mindset that ruined poland , not this particular event . 
  why ? 
  the more people know how the stock works the better . 
  that tool was abused too much and caused too much harm already . 
  so go and buy now , it is classic market panic , it is going to go up in moments . 
   `` people 's are less demanding '' lol , nope . 
  if i am more demanding i have to pay triple the price , even more than germans . 
  i find it as trying to fuck me over * more than usual * . 
  should i torch some market or something to show that i am demanding ? 
  so you are a nihilist just like me . 
  nice . 
  i will tell you how i see the world : just like you , it is shitty , it is unfair and it is made so we are afraid creatures , afraid to suffer , afraid to die , afraid to be cut away from pleasure . 
  these three motivators have shaped our whole world and how we see this world , how we can experience it . 
  but you know what ? 
  i have a dream . 
  my dream is to make the imposible true , my dream is to make the dead and unfeeling space envy us all the * fun * we can have here on this little rock , and after that we are gone in the heat-death of the universe i want this very dead and unfeeling fabric of time and space yearn and miss these little specks of matter that we are . 
  oh i 'm going to make it true and i 'm going to use these 25 years as my starting base and surely i 'm * not * going to let anyone ruin this one shot i have in doing my part . 
  this sentient meatloaf is going to have fun and if you are going to make it angry it will turn this anger into fun too . 
  speak for yourself , i like it here . 
  from the time of partitioning , the first world war , 20 years of peace , second world war and communism it is first 25 years where you can * enjoy * living here and the outlook is good . 
  i would n't choose any other point in human history to be alive with * that * social status . 
  if * you * are unhappy you can a ) move away from russia or b ) move away from russia . 
  it would not end the world but it would start a brand new one . 
  a world of shit . 
  oh how they squeal . 
  you know what the sad part is ? 
  they wo n't learn that when you are abusing power then as soon as you loose this power - you are the abused one . 
  naaah , they will believe it is just great injustice of the world . 
  oh , and not so long ago everyone around were mass-producing articles how people should * work for free * . 
  not volunteering for charity , a real full-time jobs that were making money for the employer !, 
  it is fine and dandy and you might find logic it that , but some people have like ... you know ... have to sustain themselfes ? 
  eat ? 
  well , you also can live with your parents but then we had whole another crisis of young people that ca n't sustain themselfes and we had whole new wave of articles about this . 
  honestly , i ai n't even mad . 
  people were outraged that minimal wage has to be raised . 
  i 'm interesting how 500 + pans out , i 'm kinda happy that in this whole wave of taxes * some * of it comes back to people in form that does n't stuff pocket of politicias ( infamous przetargi ) . 
  honestly , i think you have been fucked over . 
  you have * no * richer country when your * common * person can run to easilly . 
  yes , it makes your rich even reacher , but the poor gets even poorer . 
  heh , and * some * russians were calling for killing many other groups , you have your bunch of nationalists too . 
  question , how many of them do you need to `` justify dehumanizing people '' ? 
  because as far as i know ukrainians have full right to consider russia an enemy from like ... for ever , like from time of holodomor . 
  the thing is russia is ready to go on `` war '' or on war as soon as someone farts in its general direction and if everyone would have such mindset then wwii would still go on . 
  not only in cccp : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_abuse_of_psychiatry pretty long list if i might say . 
  everyone has nukes . 
  there is no such shitty situation that getting nuked would be better . 
  stop making yourself new enemies then . 
  ukrainians were n't your enemy to the moment when you put your men on their ground . 
  your government is * deliberately * turning everyone around into their enemies . 
  people who choose to initiate an assult and then use this assult as an justification for dehumanisation can bath in flaming white phosphorus for all i care . 
  my car has frozen today this morning and i was late 10 minutes and boss of my boss is already fussy about that . 
  month ago i stayed an hour to correct his invitations and then fill them with 40 names , on computer in illustrator ( because they are too cheap to buy full cc package ) . 
  i was n't paid . 
  10 minutes here , 15 there , 5 here . 
  they do n't remember * that * . 
  but you are late 5 minutes because delivery car has broken down on the driveway to the company parking , blocking * everyone * ? 
  you * thief * !, 
  you have * stolen * these 5 minutes !, 
  you are * paid * for them !, 
  fuck them , i do too good job for too little money for them to do * anything * to me hehehehehe . 
  too bad i like some guys here , i will miss them . 
  was n't that mandatory read in school ? 
  ca n't remember , been long time . 
  oh oh , this is awsome , just listen : there is a change , a shift in job market where now employee can bargain better deal and you know what ? 
  ** emplyers are lamenting that young people are too demanding and unethical . 
  ** why workers are * unethical * these days ? 
  because they care about their own profit rather than profit of a company !, 
  there were already 2 articles that i have seen , one like that ( you can goole translate it ) : http://www.pulshr.pl/rekrutacja/rekrutacja-rynek-pracy-pracownik-budowlany-chce-juz-4-tys-zl-na-reke-to-co-sie-dzieje-jest-nieetyczne,37265,1.html where people are wailing on how horrible workers are now . 
  when we were fucked in the ass it was `` free market '' and when we has a say on that market `` it is unethical '' . 
  i just ca n't even ... 
  and poles were persecuted in most of seized territories . 
   pathetic i find them funny . 
  btw , i 'm selling bike , barely used , previous owner not known . 
   maybe together we can into ~ ~ space ~ ~ atmosphere !, 
  because that was another joke in the row of silly things . 
  because some right-wingers deny some horrible stuff that happend and i find this morbidly hilarious . 
  lets just hire some pirates and give them toys to roam there . 
  and i was going further with it using meme '' ... did nothing wrong '' with little twist because . . you know . . holocaust denial even as a joke is a bannable offense . 
  onr did nothing wrong !, 
  well . . beside that long list of everything they did wrong . 
  jezus christ ffs do you want to * trigger * me that much ? 
  i do n't find anything wrong with this , 
  czechinya . 
  there are some traces in other articles about it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lilla_saltsj%c3%b6badsavtalet edit : and wayback machine remembers it hehehe https://web.archive.org/web/20150112063142/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_pixelization, 
  this is beautiful !, 
  i surprised noone jumped out to claim that chopin was french . 
  never a dead guy made me laught so much . 
  oh you know what he meant . 
  you would be right if the system that is going on around these times would n't be capitalism . 
  the thing is that if you can at places * confuse * capitalism with slavery then there is something goddamn wrong with the current form of capitalism . 
  happy cake day . 
  i work at motor company and they do the same thing too . 
  my boss would stick one to my ankle so he could force me to work at weekends . 
  usually when he tells me in the middle of the weekend to do something for him i ignore him and tend to say i was somewhere away from my phone/computer . 
  i tend to lie because he tends to not pay for extra work . 
  i do n't feel bad . 
  anger is my natural physical state at room temperature . 
  if they could they would .
