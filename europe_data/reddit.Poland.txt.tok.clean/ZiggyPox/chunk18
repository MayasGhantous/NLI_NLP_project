  quite representative for breast cancer . 
  every cancer works in different way . 
  you wo n't treat brain cancer or eye cancer you treat the breast cancer . 
  someone gets brain tumor and what you tell him ? 
  do n't worry , they well know how to cure breast cancer ? 
   you 'll find that there are only few changes mainly extending protection of the unborn . 
  these are not needed . 
   since none of us is an oncologist or an obstetrician , i 'm going to stick with my opinion backed by the linked articles , that cancer is not an indication for abortion . 
  you are aware that your article is only a narrow cutout in cancer cases and that * other * oncologists and obstetricians are taking part in creating pregnancy categories for drugs ? 
  that behind every c , d , x and a there is a test made on animals and/or human traits ? 
  and that you throw out every other research just because you have found * two * , describing a narrow case , but you will disregard * all other of them * so you can feed your bias ? 
  cancer is not * always * indication for abortion , yes . 
  it depends on what type of cancer and what chemo is planned for that , where the tumor is , stage of pregnancy . 
  saying that chemo is not dangerous for baby , directly or indirectly , is factually wrong ( sole fact that it can cause preterm birth says so ) . 
  it might be lass dangerous in some cases than other but there is still danger . 
  http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/dating-sex-and-reproduction/cancer-during-pregnancy lastly , do not close the doors for women that might have no choice but to trade their health and/or life for delivery . 
   oh , so you reckon every single case of miscarriage will end up in a court ? 
  by the word of law , it should . 
  if in practice it would n't then it means that law is dead and it is in place only for ideological reasons . 
  it also is formed the way that allows abuse and selective use . 
   ** there are only few ** ( comparing to the number of cancers ) chemotherapy regimens ** differing mainly in the amount of chemotherapeutic agents rather than their kind ** . 
  there are simply ** not that many chemotherapeutics ** out there to have a separate one for each cancer . 
  there are * many * different regimens , that 's first . 
  second it is not only in the amount , there are many various accompanying chemicals which of many has category d assigned to them . 
  these chemotherapeutics are n't used alone at most cases , yes , but there are shitload of them . 
  then i stated that most chemos has cat d and you insinuated that i had to mix categories . 
  i did not , chemo * is * dangerous and then again :  are you absolutely sure about it ? 
  i 'm asking because there were quite a few studies done on the subject that show that chemotherapy is safe for the unborn and effective for mothers . 
  you can for instance read about it here and here so to be more specific ( because i made your research for you ) there are chemo agents which are highly dangerous in first trimester , but then these are somewhat dangerous later on . 
  but still even in research that you quoted :  complications among the infants were more often associated with preterm delivery , regardless of exposure to chemotherapy in the womb , the researchers noted . 
  ** half of the women in the study delivered prematurely . 
  ** of these , 23 percent gave birth before they were 35 weeks pregnant . 
  ** in comparison , about 10 percent to 15 percent of infants are born preterm in the general population ** , loibl pointed out in the news release . 
  so there are still complications associated with using * that kind * chemo durign pregnancy . 
  the chance for a woman to deliver in these cases should only wider options for mother , not make a delivery mandatory . 
  and still we are only in the sphere of breast cancer , well researched cancer where preventive testing is widely used and it is in most cases diagnosed early so the amount of chemo can be minimal . 
   i 'm sorry , do you speak polish ? 
  mean according to you ? 
  that the mother wo n't be punished if \u00a7 2 happens . 
  and \u00a7 2 requires for action to be unintentional . 
  if death of fetus in any stage can be criminal offense then it really does open door for starting investigation for every miscarriage , because judicial proceeding comes first and establishing if it was intentional or unintentional comes second . 
  this law is impractical . 
   oh man , you really have to have lots of free time . 
  rather than watching tv , play videogames or fuck around today i have choosen to educate myself just between making dinner and going back to work . 
  i regret nothing . 
  still , i would ask you for substantive replay to my list because you made a statement that turned out to be fictitious and that kinda ... shatters your argument . 
  and when we are at it i would like to ask you for source of your claim , i wonder who spreads such misinformation . 
   just continue reading , do n't stop . 
  the relevant fragment is just eight lines below your quote . 
  oooh , i did read that . 
  nie podlega karze matka dziecka pocz\u0119tego , kt\u00f3ra dopuszcza si\u0119 czynu okre\u015blonego w \u00a7 2 . '' ; a judge * can * but it does n't mean it has to . 
  so this still requires every miscarriage to go throught legal proceedings so the court can judge if it was intentional or unintentional death . 
  http://www.infor.pl/prawo/kodeks-karny/wymierzanie-kar/685553,odstapienie-od-wymierzenia-kary-oraz-srodkow-karnych-art-61.html it still means that mother commited * a crime * and it is written down * as a crime * and that 's the problem . 
  it not be considered a crime . 
  theoretically every woman that after unprotected sex goes into prolonged and increased physical activity is a potential criminal . 
  i could go on and on but this law is just bad and so open for abuse . 
  why ? 
  smugglers should be shot dead . 
  or life long imprisonement . 
  not for smuggling only , but for risking peoples life that way . 
  abortion-tug-of-war is the oldest tool in the shed of our politicians . 
  well used and well managed one too . 
  be ready for the repeat in next 4 , 5 years . 
  yeah , but does it have a pokestop ? 
  mine has . 
  ok , brace yourself , i go throught the list : actinomycin : d tretinoin : au : x ** us : c ** azacitidine : au : x us :d azathioprine : d bleomycin : d bortezomib : ** au : c ** us :d carboplatin : d ( example of source : https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/carboplatin.html ) capecitabine : d cisplatin : d chlorambucil : d cyclophosphamide : d cytarabine : d daunorubicin : d dexamethasone : ** au : a us : c ** ( because it is only a steroid to support during hemo , part of regimen ) docetaxel : d ( exaple of other sources : http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/docetaxel.aspx ) jezus , i 'm still at d. . . doxorubicin : d epirubicin : d epothilone : d [ source based on ixabepilone ] ( https://books.google.pl/books?id=g_bwcgaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa573&amp;lpg=pa573&amp;dq=epothilone+pregnancy+category&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8_5wfarlan&amp;sig=tslmgcknie9ia6xyrzec99hu20o&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewigtoytk8tpahxmkcwkhayzdfcq6aeihdaa#v=onepage&amp;q=epothilone%20pregnancy%20category&amp;f=false ) fluorouracil : d fludarabine : d gemcitabine : d gefitinib : ** au : c ** us :d hydroxycarbamide : d idarubicin : d imatinib : d irinotecan : d mechlorethamine : d [ source ] ( http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/202317lbl.pdf ) mercaptopurine : d now i seriously want to know your source of the claim that chemo agents are n't dangerous to fetus and/or mother ... methotrexate : au :d us : x mitoxantrone : d oxaliplatin : d paclitaxel : d pemetrexed : d thalidomide : x teniposide : d tioguanine : d https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/thioguanine.html topotecan : d valrubicin : ** c ** vinblastine : d vincristine : d vindesine : d vinorelbine : d some of them are similar but * not * the same compounds but there are * many * of them so i do n't know why you claimed why there are few of them , and then * most * of them are in category d. . . and i know what category d means . 
  so you lied or someone lied to you . 
  i really would like to see your source ... just going again throught lists was a headache but i can drop source for any chem i listed here unless you think that fda is n't good source . 
  proposal :  art . 
  by this law , as i understand , if mother unintentionaly causes death of fetus , by taking wrong medications , wrong mix of medication or , dunno , falling from the stairs then she can face up to 3 years in prison . 
  yeah , i read that ... * thing * . 
  mother can be not-persecuted only after it is proven that her actions were unintentional . 
  this opens doors into turning every miscarriage into criminal case and that in itself is insane . 
  i just went throught list of most chemos used and there are around 40 of them , where many have assigned pregnancy category d , if not x. 
  only few of them are category b. andthat is * only * fetal injury . 
  then again it is only chemo , you excluded organ damage , complications and that given chemo is n't used alone : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemotherapy_regimen are we talking about the same list of chemos ? 
   even the catholic church does not condemn therapies saving mothers ' lives that endanger the unborn . 
  the problem is that wherever any country allows the liberalization of abortion laws , pro-abortion advocates push even further . 
  there already are some bioethicists who speak of so called post-natal abortion . 
  that 's a slippery slope . 
  on the other side you have people like here in poland that want full ban on abortion and these people are * worse * in this regard than catholic church . 
  also it is not only about life , it is eyesight , bone structure , renal function in the future , things that do n't kill you but hinder and shorter your life . 
  about cancer : these links are about * breast cancer * . 
  different neoplasms require different chemo and breast cancer is so well known and researched that i 'm not surprised they manage to save both women and children . 
  also breasts are n't important organs so their , lets say failure during treatment wo n't kill women ( the worst part of breast cancer is metastasis to more important organs ) . 
  for example kidney cancer would be much worse , because there is not only strain on the body from chemo but also from kidneys not working properly . 
  about convincing : well , i do n't think we can go yet to convincing each other while we did n't even establish common methodology and terminology , especially on the human-person-mind-will line . 
  who also says that i , or you , have to be convinced now ? 
  it is just food for thought . 
  for example i do find fetus , or even newborn to be worth less than mother , but i * do * believe in merit of assigning special status for children . 
  the emperor of mankind knows what he is doing . 
  we need our space marines to fight against * ruinous powers * . 
  oh my god , i 'm so tired of it . 
  we have laws regulating anything , even a fucking banana curvature ( or is that an urban myth ? ) . 
  we should have laws against misleading headers , yeah . 
  i could figure out how but we pay our lawmakers to do that . 
   only there are no situations when the foetus need to be aborted in order to save mother . 
  there are situations when earlier delivery might be necessary , but not abortion . 
  pharmacologically induced labor is one of ways of abortion . 
  cancer requires you to part with a fetus or you die in most cases .
