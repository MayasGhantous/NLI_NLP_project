  if you pharmacologically induce labor with 0 % chance of fetus survival what is the difference between that and vacuum tube ? 
   you mentioned euthanasia . 
  should n't we consider killing someone who would suffer agonising pain for the next thirty minutes and then die anyway a form of euthanasia ? 
  you 're kind of contradicting yourself . 
  ask a guy if he wants to bite that bullet . 
  if it is against his will ( and he has any will ) it is not euthanasia . 
  if we are going beyond spectrum of what is now and what is possible ( as you just used power of seeing into the future ) we can complicate the issue by creating any kind of people like with anencephaly : you say that fetus with anencephaly is a person . 
  how much of head would have to be removed for it to stop being a person ? 
  what other parts of its body ? 
  you say carniopagus parasitus is a rare case , so what ? 
  in context of making a law it might be but in context of finding out what makes human it is very important . 
  we could go beyond the body into artifical inteligence or into human awareness preserved in computer , this could be useful , yes , but i do n't know if you are willing to do that . 
  * but well ... * willingly or not you just created a problem here . 
  while introducing power of precognition and the fact that these 5 cells are human because they grow into human ... going back to the fets in fetu , before that fetus has grown into `` cancer '' it was human or not ? 
  it was not killed but it was n't also given for it to turn into human but there was n't also outside interference into its development it was n't given for it to turn into human . 
  it had human dna , it was growing like human but it turned out to be a cancerous tissue . 
  human turning into a cancer . 
  you might think i 'm laughting now but i find that thought ... perversely intriguing . 
   let me remind you that the context was whether carniopagus parasitus additional head is a person . 
  anyway , the concept of law is not perfect as it has to serve everybody , not just few . 
  and yet it does n't serve everybody but few in the case of corporational personhood . 
  all the perks of being a person and no drawbacks for a company . 
  law also allows killing of healthy people during a war . 
  law is n't good or moral , law is practical . 
  we are talking about nature of things . 
  if most people want in country for abortion to be fully legal then what ? 
  would you be ok with that ? 
  that being said law is based on what we know and there are things that we do n't know yet . 
  there are also many antics in our law based on emotions , not logic ( well , i do n't find it wrong as we are * both * emotional * and * logical animals ) and with how our knowledge widens we change our laws . 
  slavery being an example , monarchy being other one . 
   no , we do n't have brain dead patients connected to machines . 
  from time to time we do . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maternal_somatic_support_after_brain_death and also we have no problems in creating laws for these * rare occasions * . 
  going further : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5490821_prolonged_somatic_survival_of_clinically_brain-dead_adult_patient it was family that choosed not to disconnect the patient that was * brain dead * how so ? 
  or there are cases when `` brain dead '' person turns out to not be brain dead so ... yeah , you kinda picked examples from one side of the issue . 
  and issue is still there , we have brain dead `` person '' with no mind , and we have fetus with no mind . 
  theoretically we should always try our hardest to bring * even brain dead patients * back into working condition but we do n't . 
  because we ... err . . * trust in science * ? 
  even if he would be indoctrinated just pointing out indoctrination is n't going to help . 
  you could tackle this issue by pointing out that status of `` unique organism '' is n't worth more than a mind itself , you could go with abstract ideas of clones or more basic and on-the-ground ones like weighting worth of `` unique organism of fetus '' against worht of `` unique organism of mother with mind '' . 
  just a hint from me to you for the future . 
   ... which humans actually acquire few weeks after they are born , the first sign of which is when a toddler starts looking at his/her palms . 
  why then do we stop aborting children at birth time ? 
  why not later ? 
  well , do n't ask me , i would n't have problem with that . 
  for me there are cases where child euthanasia should be considered , example being when newborn is hevily disfigured and it is going to slowsly die , suffocate in next few hours , and then it is left on the table to `` let nature take its course '' . 
  that is bullshit , this child might not be aware but it is going to suffer in the same way we suffer . 
  because of the ability to suffer i 'm not ok with abortion on thw him in the late pregnancy but then again , i think that mothers life is worth more than life of a fetus so to safe mother i would abort even feeling fetus . 
   yeah , lets take very rare conditions ( there were only 10 recorded cases of craniopagus parasiticus so far ) and make the law according to them , not to the common ones . 
  scientific scrutiny . 
  if model fails at places where it should work there is problem with model , not with reality . 
  also laws are shortcuts and are n't always good . 
  example : corporate personhood , treating corporation like a person . 
   is if the state of death is so indifferent , why do we bother with punishing murderers ? 
  say , there is a ( small ) chance that within next half an hour a man will have an agonising pain in his chest , suffer for some time and die before the ambulance arrives . 
  what 's wrong with shooting him in the head before ? 
  why are n't victims of crimes examined if they 'd survive if the crime was n't committed ? 
  because even if next 30 minutes that man dies it is his 30 minutes of life and then again i 'm not saying about just bodily function but of continuous consciousness and a man is accused of murder for terminating that continuous consciousness , not for just killing body ( also we do n't want to be afraid in the society so we minimise cases where our continuous consciousness can be terminated ) . 
  on the other hand we have brain dead patient connected to the machine , without that machine patient is going to die . 
  doctor that would diconnect brain-dead patient is n't treated like a murderer , why is it so ? 
  well , to be honest , by law it is a person but it lacks personality , the idea , the thing that makes us valuable , the mind . 
   as of conjoined twins , why do n't you ask them if they feel separate persons or just one ? 
  ah , and here we are asking actuall person ( s ) for opinion beause it makes it easy . 
  what if they ca n't answer ? 
  their cognitive functions are damaged that any form of meaningful communication with them is impossible ? 
  it is easy when there is * personality * in that person but extreme situations show that our terminology is not perfect and things are n't simple . 
  then we have dissociative identity disorder . 
  it is disorder , yes , but there are multipe personalities in one skull . 
  but back to conjoined twins : it is easy to say that aware conjoined twins are different people while fetus in feut is a tumor . 
  but then we have whole spectrum of parasitic twinning , like craniopagus parasiticus . 
  where one twin stops being a person ? 
  in example of fetus in fetu you called it a cancer but why so ? 
  because it lives on the body of its twin ? 
  but every fetus does so , living on the body of other ( mother ) . 
  because it ca n't be autonomus ? 
  many preterm births ca n't survive to become autonomic , some can never be and needs machines to live their whole lives . 
  if you would connect fetus in fetu to expensive machine where it all functions are maintained externally then it would live just like foetus with an anencephaly . 
  this makes an argument of autonomy a flawed one . 
  about death : there is no difference * in death itself * if you died in car accident or in murder . 
  your continuous self , the mind , was terminated . 
  death itself in both cases is bad the same way . 
  the thing with murder is what happens to you before killing , the fear and pain . 
  and then lastly there is idea of crime and someone willingly deciding to terminate your * mind * against your own will ... oh and then there is euthanasia , self defense , suicide ... * turning off life support of brain-dead patient * . 
   there is no telling whether the issue is so complicated or we make it so . 
  it is as complicated as humans are , because , after all , it is us who give worth to things . 
  it is not simple and you know that . 
  let me break it for you : ** about what is a person : ** i did not ridicule you . 
  you made a claim but then you had to add extra pieces to it so it could make sense , i just patiently waited for you to fill the holes . 
  first you said it 's dna that makes a person , then it is dna and information , then it is dna and information in its autonomous group and lastly you added that it is a person because it is a stage of human development ... and all these points are still leaving gaping hole . 
  anencephaly being one . 
  is fetus with anencephaly a person ? 
  then again , is [ fetus in fetu ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/fetus_in_fetu ) ? 
  both of these organisms fill your description of person . 
  then another gaping hole , you say that given dna has to be in its own * set * ( that is easy to say in math but in living organism ... ) but then we have conjoined twins . 
  are these twins one person or different people ? 
  does place of joining plays important role in how much different person they are ? 
  if it is just flap of the skin ? 
  what if it is head ? 
  ** about abortion : ** then we are going back into the problem of `` potential '' . 
  the fact that something can turn into a person does n't make it a person * and that too is simple * .
