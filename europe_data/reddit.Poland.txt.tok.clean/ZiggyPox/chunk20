  if my mother would remove me when i was 5 cells i would n't be here ... but it is n't the same as i would be killed right now . 
  if my mother would have a headache at the time when they had sex , i would n't be here . 
  effect would be the same , i would n't be here . 
   your action determines whether a human being lives or dies that 's why i asked you if you see difference between a human and a person because it seems like this gets mixed here . 
  because as i said in examples of anencephaly and fetus in fetu we have human , but we have no person . 
  ** you seem indignant that i do n't take issue for as simple as you do . 
  ** it is not a simple issue and why ... well , i just lied down before you why . 
  also , why u/professionalwil wo n't join us here ? 
  there is no reason to split this conversation any further . 
   you trust in science really amazes me . 
  no one can tell how much of us is determined by nature and how much by nature . 
  and yet you trust in what ? 
  gut feeling ? 
   set ( mathematics ) ah , so it is about this . 
  you see , your starting argument was * those 5 cells already contain the personality , will to live and emotions . 
  have you ever heard of dna ? 
  * so i believe there is some individuality in that dna but then you introduce the idea that dna has to be in . . how to say it . . autonomic group , yes , to be considered an individual person . 
  so it is not only dna but a process . 
   it 's not just ability to replicate , it 's a stage in human development . 
  so another hint , it has to be * human * set of genes that turns into person in the future . 
   you can write the composition of water on hard drive all right . 
  would you be able to extract that water from your hard drive though ? 
  nah , but then you can recreate that water if you have basic building blocks . 
  then again it is not * only * information but also actual thing that counts . 
  so it is * not * only dna that makes a person for you , now i get it . 
  question : is there difference for you between human and person ? 
   i would n't go as far as to claim what is in dna and what is n't . 
  we know exacly what dna is . 
  what part does what is whole other thing . 
  also how strongly it does influence us is another question : nurture vs nature . 
  as i said , dna creates base for a person , it determines your body chemistry and how your mind works . 
  it can determine that you are susceptible to falling into alcoholism but it is % change . 
  knowledge of your genetic predisposition can allready change who you are - for example just knowing about your genetic susceptibility for alcoholism might determine you to not try alcohol , ever . 
   twins do n't have the same dna , they have identical dna . 
  it 's not one set of dna shared by two persons . 
  what the hell is set of dna ? 
   you ca n't write down h2o , co2 , c2h5oh , dna , or any other chemical substance on a hard drive . 
  you can preserve someone 's dna but it wo n't have any replicating capabilities like those few cells you call meat have . 
  so it is * not * in dna but in it 's ability to replicate ? 
  still , you can write down composition of chemical substantions on hard drive just as you did . 
  it is information , after all . 
  it is not true . 
  dna creates base , yes , but it is n't us . 
  also it is only one * part * that makes who we are  nature versus nurture . 
  if twins has the same dna then it would make them the same person . 
  but twins are n't the same person . 
  dna contains information for how give body should be constructed . 
  it is a plan , a blueprint but not person itself . 
  just like house blueprint is n't a house that dna is n't a person . 
  what if data on dna is written down ona hard drive , is this a person ? 
  if someone dies and you preserve that persons dna does it mean that this person is preserved ? 
  dna is not a personality nor emotions . 
  dna on its own is n't even live . 
  it is nucleic acid used by a cell to encode genetic information . 
  it is a tool for the cells . 
  i only accused you for omission but i did n't attach malicious intent , or any intent on your side , to it . 
  it was enought for me to kek . 
  to be honest i also do n't like how everyone around is so ready to protest anything that happens in poland . 
  i did n't comment to start banter with to you but to present whole picture to everyone presented here . 
  also i 'm aware that at times i can be not the most pleasent person . 
  as a from of apology i can offer a [ cookie ] ( http://www.etietieti.com/images/products/eti-topkek-findikli-kakaolu-kucuk-kek_55_psb.png ) . 
  my fav, 
  `` no , u '' is not an argument . 
  5 cells are n't a person and you are willing to risk persons life for 5 cells without personality , without will , without fears and emotions . 
  you are worshiping literal meat giving it attributes and worth of a human mind . 
  and you even do n't have an argument to justify it . 
  naaah i think my `` kek '' was well placed . 
  there is jarring asymmetry in how two social attitudes ( call it will of people ) are treated . 
  tools of democracy are used to cherrypick the * right * will of people . 
  and you omitted it . 
  it is like screaming `` this man has doused me with bucket of water '' while omitting that you were burning with live fire . 
  so please , embrace that kek . 
   450 k pole top kek . 
  ** 450 k poles has also signed mirror bill `` save the women '' ** that would libertize abortion laws ( easier access in short ) . 
  that bill was thrown out throught the window at the first reading . 
  pis , the ruling party has sweared to * not * do that , to let * every * citizens ' legislative initiative ( that got required 450 k signatures ) go throught first reading . 
  let 's make a referendum !, 
  again !, 
  oh that would be fun !, 
  i still believe that this is nothing more than a smokescreen , they will let people rage and after all that they want to do is done they will triumphally say `` we listen to the people '' and * do nothing * . 
  we are running in circles . 
  in goddamn circles . 
   children [ pretty little innocent children oh woe be , oh woe be !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/grxizlr.png ) you people worship meat , you have no respect for human . 
  i believe this is smokescreen for ** ceta ** . 
  we have this abortion circus every few years and then some shitty law gets slipped under our nose . 
  while fighting against abortion restrictions do not forget about other issues because this is * exacly * what they want . 
  tell your friends , do not forget , do n't get distracted , we need to divide our shared attention . 
  i do n't think he is baiting you . 
  edit : oh come on , we all know that media misuses the term `` troll '' . 
  troll used to be a person who baits you to stir some drama , it is * not * propaganda agent and * not * anyone whose opinion you consider a shit . 
  trolling is a art for god 's sake !, 
  lol , nope . 
  you are wrong and you know that : ), 
  do n't be sad . 
  we all know autumn is comming , days are getting shorter , evenighs are getting colder . 
  all you need is someone close , someone to hold you , someone to cuddle under one blanket , someone to understand you , share a smile , share a life , share a border . 
  bi-confederation maybe ? 
  i know you want it . 
  i want it .
