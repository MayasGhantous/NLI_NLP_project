  oh oh , that 's the funny part !, 
  it was obvious that if you wanted to get into important places you had to be `` from the party '' but there were goddamn levels haha !, 
  at some point it consisted of over 3.5 million members because every rural village had its own party representative . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_united_workers%27_party go give it a read , it would hilarious if it did n't actually happend . 
  i would love to have job of these guys . 
  here in communist era there were `` points for the background '' during enrolment for uni . 
  if you were from the countryside , point for you . 
  if your pops was in peoples army , point for you . 
  if you were from * the party * , point for you . 
  we are running in circles hahaha . 
  and even if you would have while set full of while women you still would hit `` diversity target '' as i am adamn sure that diversity = `` as little whiet males as possible '' . 
  bread and ~ ~ circuses ~ ~ porn . 
  infidels are below women . 
  there is no equal dignity of all human life . 
  odin welcomes only the bravest warriors , you silly . 
  it is known . 
  hahaha , he allocated his resources where they were needed . 
  people who make `` cuting edge technology '' do the same , they might be making supercomputers but as hell i 'm sure they did n't install sentient toilets and pressure sensitive titles in their bathrooms . 
  and their printer probably sux . 
  oh yeah , awsome , great . 
  if every * woman * could follow that simple advice . 
  why ever bother with shelters ? 
  as i said , what if it is your mother ? 
  you leave the house ? 
  what if you have no job ? 
  everyone can imagine that woman has no job but * a man * ? 
  pff . 
  i wonder if chief inspectorate for road transport allows diy solutions in car inspections ... 
   married to a very powerful woman okay . 
  let 's do it that way . 
  your woman/mother hits you with a cable . 
  you hit her back . 
  you give her bruise and/or black eye . 
  cops are called . 
  what happens ? 
  you try to overpower her without hurting her , you grab her at her wrists and leave couple bruises . 
  what happens ? 
  you did n't hit her back but she calls the cops . 
  you show your bruise and she tells that you tried to hurt her and you have been screaming at her . 
  what happens then ? 
  your idea od power dynamics between male and female is cartoonish . 
  [ he suggests that some people care about a cause only if there is a crowd which would applaud .

  that 's a good question !, 
  quick !, 
  to the topologistmobile !, 
  can we into that space ? 
  if that makes you a terrorist i must be satan itself ... 
  when poland turns into empire and consumes all other european countries then i will start to worry . 
  i do criticize israel for the current situation too , but at the present time tight border control is what they need to do . 
  taking into account that there are no regions for us that we can expand into and near east is too far i would n't be worried so much . 
  it is kinda like giving homeless man little bit money expecting it will fix all his problems . 
  in most cases it will make him vegetate in that state . 
  he wo n't die but nothing will change . 
  and if also happens that he/she is addict of some sort then it * can * kill him . 
  there are other options but they rub on impression of colonialism . 
   while i not disagree with that , what is the alternative ? 
  somebody wants to sell something for a certain price , somebody else wants to sell that good for said price . 
  it 's up to the seller to know the value of his goods . 
  we have many tools that we use to control the market , one of such tools is embargo . 
  there is no absolute freedom of the market . 
  entrepreneurs will cry that this is unfair ( as alwasy ) and our tekno-toys will cost more to make but gains would be much , much better for us all . 
  border control advisers , not whole cabinet . 
  international humanitarian aid made them in part addicted and that in return crippled their own agriculture , deals made between companies and their countries strongly undervalue worth of these resources . 
  also using resources from conflict zones does nothing more than fueling these conflicts . 
   made me laugh :d what do you mean by that ? 
  noone wants to come here because we are bad people :( ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ poor, 
  i think that if we are at it we could also stop sucking dry mena countries from their natural resources while paying them peanuts if anything at all . 
  yeah , that would help too . 
  also it seems our catholic-racist-twatness \u2122 ( useful for once ) works better than any amount of guns . 
  i 'm sure we would figure something out , we could invite israeli border control advisers . 
  that 's why i linked whole article . 
  germany did ratify this agreement but it also shows that germancy can * also * be `` flexible '' . 
  i am a slave to my hourly wages and many contract written before i was even born . 
   bund also called on the german government to significantly improve its climate action plan 2050 . 
  the chancellery has shrunk the plan to insignificance , the group says . 
  `` it makes germany lack credibility if we say ` yes ' to climate protection in the international arena , but then at home we continue running coal power plants and hindering the expansion of renewable energies . '', 
  http://www.dw.com/en/germany-ratifies-paris-climate-agreement/a-19570247 fleeeeeeeexible !, 
  i 'm confused . 
  that 's whole argument vs pro-life and pro-choice , what really is a fetus and when it can be considered a person and what is a person . 
  because if we arbitrary consider 2 cells as a person we have whole lot of problems to consider as you see . 
  then we have another problem , if `` potential '' is worth as much as `` actual human being '' then an abstract idea that yet not happend is worth as much as a person who is allready there ( in the case of that new legislation that is willing to risk mothers lofe and health for a person that is n't there yet ) . 
  that 's why i prefer to use a sliding scale of worth if i may say so . 
  i would go for english . 
  if they are going home , as we have been many times assured by our politicians , they should pick a language that they can use later in life in any part of the world . 
  i think the ones willing to let kids learn greek should be allowed to do so ofc . 
  and fine on the parents . 
  then i believe that after a while social care steps in to investigate on the suspiction of child neglect . 
  the laws that `` ordung idiocy '' wants to pass forces women to labor such damaged offspring . 
  also he posted this as , i believe , a form of a question : is this fetus human and/or a person and/or human tissue ? 
  just like fetus in fetu , can you consider a fetus trapped in its sibling body as the same as fetus trapped in womans body , as an argument of `` trapped '' is often used in pro-life circle . 
  starts to appear but it is n't developed in significant way . 
  there goes much more than just brain going bigger . 
  there is neuron migration and other significant changes in its structure as in function . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prenatal_perception the border between an embrio and a fetus is contractual as far as i know . 
  they need `` sacred thing '' to defend that at the same time wo n't make them responsible for anything . 
  the feel-good token . 
  yes , but brain of a fetus does n't pop into existence in an instant moment . 
  for a long time it is n't even able to store any information and its capabilites to feel are absolutely limited . 
  i 'm not for killing infants .
