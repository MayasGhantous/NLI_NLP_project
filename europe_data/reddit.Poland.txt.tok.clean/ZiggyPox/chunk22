  d'oh ... oh , wait . . no , in few narrow cases i 'm for killing infants . 
  they should compose their coastguard from people like me . 
  i 'm kinda afraid of water if i 'm not wearing a diving gear . 
  he is one special cookie , is n't he ? 
  he is going to get ptsd soon from being a politician . 
  i hope he does n't own twitter account . 
  is n't there `` i-pin '' in korea that is used all over the web ? 
  if you want to see something 18 + you need to insert your i-pin . 
  oh come on now , they have trup and hillary to choose from , their options were never * that * bad . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ vote ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hillary, 
  in this whole quote you copied there is nothing to support your statement that comparing a seed is incorrect . 
  in most cases , in almost all cases , all seeds are fertilized . 
  seed does n't form before pollination . 
  only after pollination flower withers and turns into fruit/seed . 
  that was silly , how good you are at biology ? 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-18192375 believe me brother , you can get used to it . 
  at the end you will even embrace it !, 
  now excuse me , i need to inspect my cotton fields . 
   babies [ babies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twin_reversed_arterial_perfusion ) [ he says babies !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fetus_in_fetu ) your definition of baby elevates a meatloaf to a level of a person . 
  it is not . 
  fetus is n't even a baby . 
  in terms of technicalities neonate is a baby . 
  there is no * person * in that meat without personality and vestigial personality makes for a vestigial person . 
  there is as much human in lump of cells as there is in brain dead body , with the difference that an actual person was lost when someone dies , not potential person . 
  it is like crying for blank canvas because such individual painting could have been painted on it , but without actual paint on it it is just empty canvas , not a painting . 
  fetus is not a baby just like a seed is not a tree . 
  we need someone with keen eye to look for ** any other legislations ** that might get slipped under our noses while this one ** makes for a nice smokescreen ** . 
  seriously , this abortion law bullshit comes and goes like a bad cold every few years and everytime it happens we are getting fucked up from the the back side . 
  oh how luckly i am right wing and blond , but also ** obtrusive like hell !, 
  ** i 'm helping !, 
  it is a good thing that it can be published . 
  freedom of the peach . 
  and now i 'm free to judge it : author of this article can roll it up in a little ball and insert it into its anal cavity . 
  government-less country for the sake of people , ot for the idea . 
  it is only one of many tools for better future . 
  it is just like being a catholic and praising islam for some of its good things , lets say art . 
  i must say that now i 'm pleasantly surprised . 
  thank you . 
  it took less than half a minute to get downvoted after i answered you , you got to have some vigilant guardian angel . 
  i send you a message because i did n't want to share minor drama with everyone but hey , we can all bath in that salty brime , there is enought space for everyone . 
  also for the record , you got triggered . 
   if we 're doing technicalities now , it 's a question of whether or not poland is responsible for processing asylum requests . 
  well , as we are not on the migrants route and migrants keep as far away from poland as they can there is n't much of them and the few we get here we do process if we are speaking about technicalities now . 
  surprised ? 
  https://euobserver.com/beyond-brussels/134447  next time poland wants something out of the ordinary i guess . 
  when was the previous time ? 
  i 'm so sorry you got triggered by everyday problem of modern europe . 
  if you want to know then answer is simple : deals and regulations . 
  i would ask other question : ** `` oh how did this go from buying land to western immigrants ? '' ** ... 
  aaah , the secrets of life : ), 
  well , technically we are taking * refugees * from one and only country that can produce people called * refugees * by international law , and that country is ukraine . 
  that being said this freedom is being constanly undermined by west so that freedom is not upheld by `` honoring agreement '' but because poland is ... how it is said , `` stubborn and backwarded '' or whatever . 
   seems like a simple agreement to honor . 
  it looks that freedom to suspend farmland purchases by foreigners for three years might be in line with that agreement . 
  if it would n't be then i 'm sure there is european organ to point that out . 
  lastly there are civil deals that even when two sides has signed a document that deal is void , one being an usury . 
  there should be no possibility to sell of someones sovereignty because you need only one wrong cabined that slipped into power to ruin a country forever and selling off land to foreign investors , if handled wrongly , can be such thing . 
  well , during accession process noone said we are going to take mass of illegal immigrants which by legal standard ca n't even be called refugees so what was said during accession process can go down the toilet when west wants it seems so . 
  also about what power balance we are talking here ? 
  poor selling their land to the rich vs poor being outsorced for the rich because both , buying land and having cheap workforce benefits only western rich . 
  if you are going to sell all your land to foreigners why bother having a country at all ? 
  it is hypocrisy . 
  noone forces you to hire western europeans . 
  also you too take the option to protect your markets for as long as you could : http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/artykul/24516,austria-germany-open-borders-to-polish-workers hypocrisy much ? 
  hahaha , did you accused a german of racism ? 
  oh my god , which way to the bunker ? 
  because he is an anarchist for the sake of a goal , not for being an anarchist . 
  if big gov does something right then it did something right . 
  i would even support communist government if there would be in history one that protects and works for well-being of its people , not enforces an ideology for the sake of ideology even when clearly so many is suffering because of that . 
  naaah , the ones about new bra on the market are much , much better . 
  can you imagine how much * engineering * is involved in that coconut holder ? 
  is n't it like basic income ? 
  i am a man and i read woman magazines at the dentist ... 
  sikh are awsome . 
  they say that * part * of turkey is in europe so they are * technically * wrong . 
  that is true on its own , but two wrongs does n't make good and you end with grop of people bombed twice with no peace on the horizon . 
  to be honest if we could overthrown all dictators just by bombing them i would be even ok with that , but history has shown that this does only what i have described in the first sentence . 
  literally i 'm illiterate in german ( beside `` h\u00e4nde hoch '' ) so i would ask for little bit of understanding . 
  also what i wanted to say that `` it doubled '' is n't big or smal value in itself , i did n't mean to argue if it really doubled or not . 
  naaah , i did n't mean that . 
  what i wanted to tell is that democracy should come from people wanting democracy . 
  you ca n't just go and bomb people into democracy , it almost never works . 
  ok , now try to translate this 2 part for every doctor or lawyer !, 
  those guys from ordung whatever are all lawyers , are n't they ? 
  ooooh how jollious it would be to make them all accountable for all their machinations !, 
  and no benefit of doubt anymore !, 
  and polliticians too !, 
  fucking everyone !, 
  yes , i 'm raging here !, 
  oh my god , fuck everything about this . 
  `` christian lawyers , pushing for christian traditon based law '' can you imagine demographic slice of bigger assholes than this mix ? 
  i used to excuse our new gov , give them benefit of the doubt but if they are going to pass it i 'm going fucking ballistic . 
  and not only me . 
  and it it turns out to be * another fucking somkescreen * to pass another shitty law we do n't know about then i 'm going thermonuclear . 
  i 'm fucking tired of iit goddamnit . 
  hello there !, 
  how is emperor william monument doing ? 
  last time i have been there there was an ongoing excavacation of lower levels of the monument . 
  yeeeah , you are right , but i still believe that support should be soft , because as soon as you start sending guns and/or people then counter revolutionary forces ( or loyalists ) have strong political ammo of `` fighting against foreign forces '' with argument of western exploitation of mena countries ( because we do that ) and other .
