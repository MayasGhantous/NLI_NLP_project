  because even then strong support of society might be lost in mere days . 
  i got confused by the newcomer/old migrant thing . 
  i thought it wars worth noting these inside conflicts . 
  he was sitting on a sofa , why bring wooden chair when you can look at it all from the comfy sofa ?? 
  i think people in foreign countries should be free to chose when and how to overthrown their dictators . 
   unless it 's committed against newcomer migrants by old migrants , oh , like migrants are one big block of one group of people . 
  we are seeing them as one and the same , but these are different people from different countries with different cultures that might look similar for us , but not for them . 
  something like a person from china would see poles , ukrainians and err . . czechs as the same group of people . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ would n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ mind , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ let 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ federalize ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yaaaay !, 
  you know , if there would say , have 10 hate crimes per year , then 20 hate crimes next year would be `` 2x '' ... while in other country that has 100 hate crimes 2x would be much , much worse . 
  so depending on the base number that 2x might mean * nothing * . 
  but for sure it makes great headline . 
  minden is better :p, 
   a dictator i think this is that part . 
  i might sound horrible ( and i 'm probably are ) but it looks like me works much better with a dictator on top rather than havoc of revolution and civil wars . 
  i know a fancy word for that !, 
  we will teach them to love us . 
  looks like teratoma . 
  revolting . 
  i think people are just getting angry and are tired having no meaningful choices . 
  we are working on it . 
  `` holandia '' is official name of netherlands in polish hahaha ... but full name is still `` kr\u00f3lestwo niderland\u00f3w '' . 
  lol , good one . 
  top chek . 
  per head or per family ? 
  well , that is actually pointless question because as far as i remember they are not allowed to work , and even with 3-person family they would n't get minimal wage amount . 
  it does sound like mockery . 
  romanian people get unemployment aid around 180 euro . 
  minimal wage is 217,50 eur . 
  so a family of 3 would get 300 euro as it is usually paid per head . 
  i would n't call it exacly kicking people . 
  if romania is also giving then shelter * and * 100 euros then it is n't such bad deal , but i do n't know , maybe u/ctudor knows . 
  ** rant warning ** , you have been warned . 
  a clear example how small and big companies in midnless self indulgence of chasing profit , while ignoring long-term consequences , can kill us all . 
  big fish that is making money wo n't have problem in buying the newest drug and hiring the best doctor to treat his pus discharging ass and after his ass heals he will fly in his jet to take nice long vacation on one of few yet-to-be-polluted tropical island . 
  he will take the cremme while scum will be left for us . 
  as far as i know even germans and swedes has hard time offering them opportunities they wished for . 
  hmmmm , yeah , after thinking for a while yes , it seems that is more true . 
  i do n't think that a `` trend '' is the same thing as `` supposed to be '' but that might be just semantics . 
  who said so ? 
   bipolar-bear i think i 'm not brave enought to argue with a bear that is bipolar . 
  lets make it simple and talk about a refugee , not an immigrant : far from home that is burning , without any welth , only vegetating and not living , having to accomodate to foreign customs , having no freedom of movement , having no outlook on your future , bleak perspectives , slowly wasting your days . 
  do n't take me wrong , i also think that being a refugee is being lucky in the case of war ( where other option is being dead ) but it is not stress-free situation . 
  you can say many bad things about this whole situation but damn , you could at least understand mans need to puff a smoke or two more . 
  yaaaaay !, 
  more microplastics pollution !, 
   especially a man fleeing war torn-country you know that stress makes you rely on your addictions much , much more than in normal time , yes ? 
  that would make us go so ballistic that maybe we could into space . 
  that 's not being pedantic . 
  that 's like difference between machiavellianism and patriotism . 
  there is no point in making russia a powerstate while russian people are suffering while being brainwashed . 
   ( i like how he puts russia first , but fuck him for what hes doing to ukraine at the same time ) errr ... he puts russia first but not the russian people . 
   i asked what is better of terms of being manageable . 
  i might not be clear enought about it this whole argument between various people went like that : someone started with saying  * `` germany 's and sweden 's not right to be doing their kind of shit . 
   i prefer the hungarian way , at least the odds of getting decent people are higher that way . 
  '' * then it went into * `` which kind of immigration is beter '' * and then , while pointing at posibility of importing criminals , '' * which kind of criminal is better . 
  '' * then i asked * `` which one is better to cut out ? 
  a trafficker that you can screen while he applies or a lone wolf that slips under your radar ? 
  '' *  how about neither ? 
  ** and that is exacly fucking that . 
  ** that 's how whole conversation went . 
  you can cut out all lone wolfs with breaking status quo of current immigration system while you can screen rich traffickers and * also * cut them off !, 
  ** a trafficker that you can screen while he applies ** . 
  what the hell you do wich such trafficker ? 
  you do n't let him in because you screened him !, 
  that 's how screening works !, 
  implyingthen that i prefer traffickers is just plain stupid . 
   hungary is n't forced to choose either rich africans or syrian refugees . 
  because they are not . 
  they * choosed * to invite rich africans and * not * to let unknow mass but as far as i remember , some politicans tried to force them to let immigrants in so here you are plain wrong . 
  ** that was comparison between two immigration systems ** , it is not my fault that ** you could n't follow a conversation . 
  ** so it not only justifies my actions of paying back in kind but also proves this whole argument went over you head , that 's why i can be high and mighty here . 
  you just butted in , you clearly did n't get what was going on and then still you try to moderate my opinion . 
  in the context of braindeadness , you might find it helpfull : http://www.livestrong.com/article/289107-the-best-vitamins-to-increase-brain-function/, 
  it is called `` paying somebody back in their own coin '' . 
  a fancy idiom , you might want to take notes . 
  so yes , it is flawless logic bro . 
  yeah , i get you . 
  a comatosed patien in basically misterious box . 
  you can not tell if a person is there or if it is not . 
  but we are taking into account that there * was * a person in that body and still might be . 
  that 's why we are fighting for comatosed patients , not because there might appear someone that never was but because someone might not be lost yet . 
  basically it is more real-life case of bringing back dead to life . 
  if we had even 1 % chance to do that it would be a crime not to . 
  bringing back comatosed patient is no different from , lets say , trying to save a patient from extensive head injury where brain is spilling on the stretcher . 
  it borders with idea of continuity of consciousness like : does person in deep asleep is the same that is wide awake ? 
  going forward , everything is social construct , after all we are just funky particles in funky meatsack . 
  without social constructs nothing is worth anything , life is an accident , death is natural state of cosmos , pain and pleasure are akin to holograms of chemical interactions , gold is just one variation of matter without worth ... and name . 
  just like life itself is funky product of matter that mind itself is funky product of life and human mind is one special cookie in that bag . 
  what we love and value is byproduct of random evolution . 
  i think i 'm in core a nihilist and that there are 3 basic motivators in human life : we do n't want to suffer , we want to experience pelasure and we do n't want to die . 
  we want to fulfill them all but in extreme cases we are willing to trade one for another . 
  i think these 3 points are as close to objectivity as we can get . 
  err , fetus does not evolve . 
  it progress in development the same way teen progress into adulthood . 
  do not worry , someone will vote for you . 
  and probably under your name too . 
  they do n't even try ... 
  they 're dead , mate . 
  i know you did n't mean that because this is misunderstanding , but i was talking about * mother * .
