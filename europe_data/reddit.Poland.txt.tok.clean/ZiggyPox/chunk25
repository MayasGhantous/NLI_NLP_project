   a pretense of having a virtuous character , moral or religious beliefs or principles , etc. , that one does not really possess . 
  you hold believe that making baseless assumption makes you `` full of shit '' . 
  you made baseless assumption . 
  let 's make it easy , are you a hypocrite or just full of shit ? 
  well , for sure we are here * not * to be turned into another german land or whatevr is called your administrative unit . 
  thank you for your pointless opinion . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53yib9/hungarian_ad_in_new_african_magazine/d7xocix that 's what / u/bob _ in_the_west assumed about me . 
  i asked what is better of terms of being manageable . 
  i might not be clear enought about it but it still did not justify his assumptions . 
  switzerland has wonderfull history of keeping pernamently neutral stance . 
  i really respect that . 
  keep it up . 
  go away . 
  pulverise this piece of shit into fine ground dust . 
  i hope she is happy here and that she brought her family . 
  i assumed what you thing without you telling you what you think , that made me `` full of shit '' but i did so * only * after you assumed what i think and what i am ok with * without * me saying what i 'm ok with . 
  you are free to assume what i think while i am full of shit while assuming what you think ... that 's a dictionaty definition of a hypocrite . 
  and where i said i do n't like muslims ? 
  : ) where i said that i 'm ok with traffickers ? 
  seems like you , my friend , are not only full of shit but also a hypocrite . 
  nah , you did n't force us . 
  we made a deal . 
  do n't blame us that it turned out it is a shitty deal for you . 
  we ca n't even spend that money the way we want and we have to finance like other half of everything . 
  you did not force us but who did force you ? 
  no one ? 
  damn strange , is n't it ? 
  well , can * you * read ? 
  i wrote that * you * do n't like poles . 
  why would you be okay with traffickers ? 
  i do n't know ? 
  maybe it is based on the same idiocy as what you said , that i would be ok with traffickers ? 
  make-believe ? 
  what ? 
  what is easier to cut off ? 
  a trafficker that comes to you with loadshit of money that you can screen or a terrorist hidding between immigrant ? 
  i 'm not okay with human traffickers but i will tell you more , * you * are okay with human traffickers because * these * are the people who are throwing these immigrants throught the borders * and you are more than okay with that * . 
  deal with it , * you * are okay with traffickers and muslims , just do n't like poles and your world is a make-believe one . 
  you are funny , you know that ? 
  everything . 
  i just illustrated that talking in absolutes is pointless here . 
  now you are talking in absolutes . 
  yes , we ca n't put every scum behind the bars . 
  should we stop trying ? 
  lol , yeah , that what you said is just pure bullshit . 
  all what i did before was just correcting your other bullshit . 
  i did n't say we are pure , i did n't say we are hard-working . 
  what i said is that we are working ( just as hard like anyone else ) , and we are doing it for germans , jobs that germans do n't want to do and also we are underpaid few times in comparison to what would be paid to germans , that 's why your businessmen enjoys having us in eu . 
  that what `` outsourcing '' means , that what good deal means for you . 
  this and other things . 
  there is no narrative that i have to defend but it seems that your narrative `` poland , the subsidied leech of eu '' is crumbling . 
  your turn . 
  which one is better to cut out ? 
  a trafficker that you can screen while he applies or a lone wolf that slips under your radar ? 
   but to do ~ ~ busines ~ ~ ~ ~ get subsidies ~ ~ get paid for opening polish market and outsorcing our people for `` jobs that germans do n't want to do '' . 
  do n't pretend that it was n't a deal that was meant to be good for you . 
  no sane country makes a deal that will cripple them as much as you are crying now . 
  i hope ukrainians will mince them so hard that they wo n't find any more tourist to send in their quasi war , now or ever . 
  they can even drop white phosphorus on them , i do n't care . 
  someone turns your home into a battlefield , go and give them hell . 
   kerfuffle hehe anyway , there are changes that i too value . 
  before pis the * work inspection bureau * in the case , lets say , illegal and/or informal employment had to send one week notice to employer that he is going to be inspected . 
  what would they find ? 
  nothing . 
  why ? 
  we all know this . 
  illegal worker just does n't go to work that day . 
  with new law now inspections should be unannounced . 
  if exit of poland is so good for everyone then i would start by making a profitable offer for poland by the eu members wishing to get rid of poland . 
  money , deals , whatever . 
  isolating out of free will `` because eu must go forward '' is n't in poland 's best interest . 
  `` we agree to disagree '' is not an agreement . 
  it is a problem still unsolved . 
  yeah , you like these candies more . 
  too bad these are not the ones you have to deal with . 
  that 's psychological repression . 
  common immigration and asylum policy : keep asylum seekers , kick out illegal immigrants , there is no reason to change dublin rules . 
  [ without these rules eu can be easilly destroyed by nothing more than a * will * of african people to move to europe . 
  ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7owv-zfbhoy/maxresdefault.jpg ) the shape that `` common immigration and asylum policy '' is taking now is nothing more than moving problem in time . 
  poles and hungarians are blocking not progress , but insanity . 
   but again in return they gain the greater good of being able to close their borders and deny entry to every last single muslim refugee in the whole wide world . 
  hah , the point is that even in eu we can still refuse last single muslim * immigrant * without breaking any laws . 
  so there is no point in leaving , there is no reason in taking punishment . 
  yes or no . 
  depends if everyone is going to try to `` punish leavers '' just like with uk . 
  getting better deal in eu or shittier deal outside eu , from business perspective leaving eu has no point . 
  and poland is there to do business . 
  being little bit national is n't bad . 
  being little bit socialist is n't bad . 
  being little bit christian is n't bad . 
  but why this mix must turn so shitty ? 
  poland is in eu not because of fear , but to do business . 
   poland is n't talking about leaving the eu already is their fear of the russians . 
  because nato not real . 
  you should slap a trigger warning on this one . 
  well , to be honest i used to defend pis gov because they were getting lot of flak just for being right-wing . 
  i was fed up with po and willing to give pis the benefit of the doubt , like , you know , * not * assume that they are there to turn poland into catholic state . 
  ** but my patience is wearing thin . 
  ** this whole comedy show about abortion ... * again * . 
  i know it goes over their head , the notion that human tissue is n't equal to a person .
