  we were tired of the shit previous gov was doing but i wo n't settle for turning my daily shit for another brand of daily shit . 
  they might have different opinion on some topics but i wo n't let it be shufflet down my throat . 
  and after all , there is a risk that his is another * smokescreen * . 
  oooooh and i have been reading interviev with sikorski today , that poles will be wishing to go back in time of `` octopus-gate '' . 
  ** mother fucker * has guts . 
  i 'm tired of settling for lesser evil . 
  ** i am tired of settling for lesser evil . 
  ** i was good boy and everslept my * teenage-rebel-time * but maybe it is time to catch up and go into some extreme spectrum ? 
  left ? 
  right ? 
  * i do n't care anymore * . 
  this is how you make angry people . 
  oh yeah , that would be this one . 
  i wonder how big his weenie is . 
  there is nothing to be afraid , after all . 
  do you think his anus is dark or pink ? 
  does he wash his hands after every poop ? 
  how often does he drink ? 
  does he has hidden stash of a pot somewhere in his house ? 
  there is no reason to be afraid . 
  what kinky porn does he like ? 
  does he swear a lot ? 
  does he wear his panties for more than one day ? 
  ** there is no reason to be afraid . 
  ** did he even wore a womens clothing ? 
  did he wore a make-up ? 
  what is his opinion on abortion ? 
  #there is no reason to be afraid , zuck . 
  plot twist : we are not important part of this plan . 
  or god simply hates us . 
  or he does n't care . 
  or misery makes him stronger . 
  i hope it is just no-plan-at-all option . 
  there is a version of watchmaker analogy , where god created the world and set it in motion but then he does n't interfere into it , because design is perfect and does n't need interference . 
  but then bible and free will woops . 
  err , there is an industry of makers of honeymoon sex tapes as a form of ... souvenir . 
  i would google it for you but i 'm at the office : ) edit : would you mind to share some of your * cultural exports * ? 
  you just blew my mind . 
  i never owned an iphone but i do own a computer and it might not have been made by poor black kid in the asscrack of africa there is huge chance that that poor black kid was mining for rare earth elements my rig is running on . 
  and your rig . 
  and every computing station in every office . 
  fun fact : after a war in the communist block there was a shortage of everything and when the wall fell there was not really a choice to choose other products . 
  people did n't know , many still do n't know . 
  from the same place comes your shirt and plastic made oud of bloody oil . 
  and then you , as a white westerner , you have both hands and there is given output that these hands can produce , worth x $ $ . 
  every year it is worth less because there are more and better robots to do your job . 
  maaaan , people do n't even know how fucked we are hahaha . 
  you know , the thing is that stuff for 10 $ and 50 $ breaks the same , if you want something to last you pay 120 $ and even then you are not sure if it is just 10 $ stuff with ~ ~ beats ~ ~ fancy logo on it . 
  what the ... 
  sounds tasty . 
  if you are going to apply burn to the same spot over and over again then that tissue is turning necrotic . 
  and then we will be burning the dead horse . 
   so how did bohr keep his mind supple and flexible , ready to accept new ideas when his peers like einstein could n't ? 
  well , here 's the thing -- there are several studies that indicate that being drunk can actually improve your creativity . 
  that 's because it prevents your mind from being able to focus , so it more readily drifts from one connection to another , which can yield creative solutions to problems . 
  the risk of being alcoholic is more real than ever for me . 
  * `` i am human , and nothing of that which is human is alien to me . 
  '' * also , did you assume my gender ? 
  naaaaah , i do n't believe that laziness is problem of the south . 
  i think it is corruption . 
  also , have you noticed , there was `` west-east '' barier layed throught europe , but `` south '' is something new in media , at least from where i 'm standing . 
  `` free '' , lol . 
  are you taking into account change in worth of currency ? 
  this is hilarious . 
  if someone is willing you to pay fat cash for * not * investigating you can be sure that there is something really , really wrong . 
  this is rich mans world allright then . 
  good thing iron and wood is cheap . 
  it is really hard to recognize sarcasm throught the screen . 
  do n't blame people for what you have written . 
  now now there , there is absolutely no reason in making yourself new , powerful enemies . 
  or if you sand them be prepared for the consequences and unless you are doing something ... * unorthodoxal * remember , at the end of the day : * homo sum ; humani nihil a me alienum puto * . 
  we are all naked under clothes and more or less we look the same . 
  there is nothing wrong with nudity and sex , do n't let people shame you for doing what * everyone * is doing and for things that are hurting * noone * . 
  i was talking about a war . 
  also it is hard to spill something over someones border when said policy is to keep the border tight . 
  i do n't mind being a part of a murder . 
   who want the eu 's money but do not want to abide by her treaties we mostly do . 
  too bad nobody is writting treaties under the needs of our market ( in contrast to more western-than-western markets ) . 
  how comes german markets has always solution ready for every demand of eu before that demand appears ? 
  and also that solution is easy to export ? 
  nah , it 's just my imagination and xenophobia . 
  we are agar in a petrish dish , destined to be consumed so a mold can spread and grow . 
  i * hope * this time it wo n't spill over our borders . 
  hahaha , this is horrible and i am amused . 
  i am horrible . 
  jewish is nationality , etchnic group and religion , sometimes all at once , sometimes not . 
  i just died little bit inside . 
  well , i do n't want to say that there is a problem or that there is not , but saying `` it did n't happen to me '' or `` it is very rare '' is n't a good argument . 
  example : have you been raped ? 
  have someone you care about ? 
  anyone you know ? 
  now try to say * `` 1 girl got raped , million of other girls ( me included live like nothing ever happened ) '' * . 
  would you dare to say that ? 
  there is only point in collecting iron if it is heavy in one bing chunk , othervise it is too much hassle . 
  copper is much , much better to steal . 
  what a waste of resources ... 
  break their legs . 
  dahl makes decend guns , their sniper rifles kinda scuks and ... oh ... it is not r/borderlands ? 
  damn ... 
  have you been criticized for that too ?
