  and vast majority of this mass is immigrants with a plan to stay . 
  also you corrected me first in the immigrant/refugee terminology , so there must be revelant difference . 
   aka fuck european solidarity , it 's the mediteranean countries problem , no matter how dire the situation and how bad the humanitarian situation in their camps . 
  who cares about camps as long as it is not poles who have to be in them , right ? 
  aka `` social contract and law is important to the moment when ** i ** say it is n't ! '' . 
  you know , you are cherry picking parts of laws and `` social contract '' that fits your dogma , throwing everything out of the window . 
  would being consistent hurt you that much ? 
   yeah . . civil war has nothing to do with that . 
  it 's all just economic migration . 
  every migrant comes from a country where civil war is raging ? 
  that is one slippery slope you got there . 
  i could make one about pararell societies and civil war but it tires me to pointlesly emulate your thinking . 
  something something moral superiority . 
  anyway , we are free to do what we want and to open our door for who we want . 
  maybe you do n't know but we have muslims in poland and in no way our state is persecuting them . 
  it is about the numbers we can manage and how well we can enforce our laws on incoming minority . 
  we are not going to kick anyone out but we do n't have to let anyone in . 
   refugees are not immigrants . 
  oh god , this thing again ? 
  what is % of refugees compared to immigrants in this mass of people ? 
  also what international laws are saying about refugees and the first country they arrive to ? 
  i know you have tendency to call every immigrant an refugee . 
  and lastly ... wait , i will try to tell it like you did about us : ** `` they 're just in it for the money '' ** , oh yeah , that 's about right . 
  if they were n't they would n't ignore * half of the europe * to get to the germany and would n't also * run away from the poland that invited them * to run away from the germany . 
  will you show equal distaste toward that ? 
  of course you wo n't . 
  oh now you showed your true colours , cookie . 
  who said we do n't want peace , who said we do n't want liberty ? 
  who said we want a war ? 
  that 's your opinion about poles and poland ? 
  human rights and culture . . hmm . .  human rights include many very important cultural rights , which should be given equal attention , such as the right to participate in cultural life , enjoy one 's culture , etc. 
  even these , however , are not unlimited . 
  in accordance with international law , the right to culture is limited at the point at which it infringes on another human right . 
  ~www.unesco.org it seems you shitting at idea of culture is against human rights , what a surprise !, 
  well , this * is * funny . 
  i told you , do n't shit at the idea of culture as it means a lot for people , but you still did and now you look silly . 
  or you are going to tell me now that unesco is somehow wrong and * your * idea of human rights is better ? 
  as i said before we are not against immigration , we can take immigrants case by case , not as a mass of people from places where human rights are abused and its abuse is rooted in laws and some parts of their culture , like those coming from extreme patriarchy . 
   you 're just in it for the money and you have no interest in the european idea etc. 
  european idea was first and foremost an economic union , everything else was added over time . 
  this is now * our union * and we are going to shape it too , you want it or not . 
  and our european idea is rather different than yours . 
  anyway , you took us for the money too , for new open markets and cheap work , get off your high horse , i know they spoonfeeded you glorious european ubernation propaganda but that all was a business for west . 
   right . . when i call a racist spade a spade it 's character assassination . 
  yes !, 
  because at every other point when i * was * right you run away to `` you are a racist '' argument what i find funny because ... it does n't work . 
  i know germans are afraid to be called a racist but people here will give you funny look and smile . 
  you ignored every my point about sharia and customs , how i exposed your accusations of deflection as nothing more than other deflection , how i pointed out you can bare me immigrants and their other way of thinking but not our polish and you ignored all thab * because i am a racist boo hoo * . 
  if i would take your place and your methods i would just say `` is calling a bigoted spade a spade a deflection ? '', 
   i mocked you for your nationalist victim complex . 
  and i mock you for your superiority complex and moral supremacy  i know people tend to cut you poles a lot of slack due to the history bwahaha , like when ? 
  for ever we have been called a backwarded country . 
   hitler did so , as did do the neonazis and the afd arguments that way , and surprise : you do , too . 
  well , nazi also loved animals , dogs mostly . 
  oh , and physical fitness , are these things bad ? 
  do n't use an argument that `` something is bad because nazi did it '' , it is primitive and puts upside down whole action-reaction thing . 
  nazis were bad because they did bad things but not every thing that nazi did were bad . 
  nazis had christmass , nazis were making laundry , nazis were drinking and playing posrts . 
  you know why hitler get into power ? 
  because germans were treated like shit after wwi , they were told that they are losers , backward primitives and hitler only pointed that out . 
  but they probably do n't teach you that in school . 
   again generalization , racism . 
  what is the `` way they like '' ? 
  their culture and their laws . 
  sharia is * a law * to follow . 
  in many places you ca n't have sharia * and * host laws , they are mutually excluding . 
  fmg is also part of their culture , it is crime here . 
  halal meat is against our values as we see halal killing animal abuse . 
  i can go on and on . 
  anyone who is interested in following our customs is welcome and we can take them case by case . 
  no by millions . 
  we also would n't let asians open butchery where they butcher cats and dogs but at the same time we have no problem with them as people . 
  also i would n't expect a middle east country to follow my customs and my laws when i visit them . 
   we expect them to follow the rule of law rule of the law is to state your real name and place of origin just as like following immigration procedures . 
  many of your immigrants dos n't follow these rules , social contract is broken but * somehow * pointing this out makes me a racist . 
  also polygamy is illegal in germany . 
  also children brides are illegal in germany . 
  something tells me i know more about various middle eastern cultures than you do . 
   you should not have joined the eu oh , this is going to be good . 
   if you do n't want european freedoms , you ca n't have european moneys , sorry . 
  well , we enjoy `` european freedoms '' in the amount we want * and * we are required to . 
  if we would n't we would be sanctioned long time ago . 
  ** but we were n't . 
  ** your threat is impotent because we follow social contract and you ca n't do anything because what you require from us is * outside * said social contract . 
  also the way that things are going now might end with eastern europe setting rules for `` scoial contracts '' in europe in near future . 
  i wonder how eager you will be then to follow white racist xenophobic poles . 
  about that european money ... you are aware that was another social contract , we open our market and our cheap labour so your economy would get another boost against stagnation ? 
  ** that that money is given to level the pplayground between german goliaths ( that had time to develop into powerfull industries ) and stumped by communist polish economy ? 
  ** also we ca n't spend that money the way we want , it all must be acknowledged by eu . 
  we are independed nation , not one of your lands . 
  also it was to move us from influence of russia . 
  ** you had as much interest in having us in eu as we had . 
  ** it is not , and never have been free money . 
  do n't try to play `` how generous we are '' card , because you are not . 
  also our little differences makes you want to kicks us out from eu , now i wonder how you can bear bigger differences of your immigrants . 
  the `` others '' of us seems less bareable for you than the `` others '' of them . 
  you fascinate me . 
   immigrant men in that case . 
  again you just deflected to another aspect . 
  ignore my racism and instead nitpick on details .
