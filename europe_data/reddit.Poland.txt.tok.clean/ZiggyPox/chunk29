  deflection for deflection my friend . 
  you started by character assassination , claiming * what i must think * while * i did n't say such things * and then , when i defend myself showing you how wrong you are you accuse me of nitpicking . 
  and funniest part is that i * did * came back to that aspect , my answer was as folows :  it changes nothing !, 
  we do n't want people killing eachother here , being it immigrants or poles !, 
  as soon as we take them in they are our responsibility !, 
  but you * had * to ignore it so you could attack me personally , did n't you . 
  oh man , your bias is just seeping through your pores . 
  i know that you nonchalantly and with irony stated you are anti-polish , but something tells me you * really * are !, 
  lol , again , i did n't say that `` wholesome '' polish murder is better . 
  it is a murder we are responsible for , done by people we created and also by people we know how to manage . 
   you draw an arbitrary line , this time with religion no , it is arbitrary line drawn by region and knowledge of its issues . 
  these people * are * different and they * like * the way they are but when they come here we expect them to live the way * we like * . 
  that creates the whole problem . 
  it is not stereotypes , if these would be then all of nubers would look different and there would be * no * ghettos and issues germany and sweden are facing now . 
   i bet if you say `` murder '' the image in your head is an innocent polish women being murdered by muslim brutes . 
  lol , no . 
  because unlike you i know statistics and for your information , overwhelming victims of murders are * men * . 
  but i like how you image of `` racist idiot '' is wholesome . 
  you problably thinking i 'm sporting some sort of patriotic tattoo too and how i must love football . 
  and that i am a man . 
   does n't matter that of course the majority of victims of immigrant criminals will be other immigrants , we got a narrative to hold up here . 
  it changes * nothing * !, 
  we do n't want people killing eachother here , being it immigrants or poles !, 
  as soon as we take them in they are our responsibility !, 
   what !? 
  if he has to pay german wages , what reason does he have to move production to poland ? 
  something something arbitrary lines , we are all people . 
  wages between munich or frankfurt are not as diffrent as wages in germany and poland . 
  * you enjoy these arbitrary lines . 
  i knew you would that . 
  when our murder rathes were * sligtly * higher then it was a grand argument against me . 
  now it turns around and then `` it does n't matter , you are racist anyway '' and that shows you were right for once , you * are * `` big bad pole hater '' or at least biased because you would use * any * argument , important or not ( ** as you just pointed that it is not , heh ** ) , to stand against our way of doing things . 
  ** `` no bad tactics , only bad targets '' ** , eh ? 
  and it is not only your opinion , dew germans allready were pointing `` slighty higher murder rates '' as an argument to shut me up . 
  now what , it is n't important again ? 
  this all chain of comments come from `` read below to see a live experiment in human bias . '' . 
  i like how people are pointing out bias just when they are biased the same way . 
  so in this context , as i said , that we are taking responsibility for our own people and working on better poland , well , we are doing better than germany * at least in that context right now * . 
  then again , if culture would n't mean anything and borders would be only arbitrary lines then go tell german investors who are building assembly plants in poland to pay poles a german wage , not polish one . 
  because when we are talking about money . 
  why here `` the others '' is fine for germans ? 
  ah yes , it is just business . 
  i might be wrong i do n't say i ca n't be , but at least i 'm not a hypocrite . 
  my mistake ? 
  i did n't make that table . 
  also , i like how you run away as soon as you are proven wrong : ), 
  naaah , someone just put 1 on the wring side of coma . 
  it should be 1.0 , not 0.1 , especially that raw numbers are there and as it goes like ** 2011 : ** 449 ( 1.2 ) , ** 2012 : ** 377 ( 0.1 ) , ** 2013 : ** 298 ( 0.8 ) , ** 2014 : ** 283 ( 0.7 ) you can see that it is nothing but human error . 
  i 've allready submited question about that to the site manager , we will see what they will do . 
  on the other hand , your site has iffy way of sourcing data . 
  http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/germany/crime half of these things are from * wikipedia * where wikipedia is a secondary source * and * dates are from 2008 , 2009 , at least in the case of murder , that we are talking about . 
  and lastly , your site uses united nations office on drugs and crime , * my * site as a source of its data ... face it , you tried to use it as an argument against me but it backfired , nowdays you have bigger murder rates . 
  now what ? 
  these are links from https://www.unodc.org/ and that 's err ... united nations office on drugs and crime , i 'm not sure it is legit . / s it leads here : http://www.unodc.org/gsh/ which leads here : https://data.unodc.org/ where under `` crime and criminal justice '' you can find all the data you need , including the ones i linked that * somehow * does n't work on your computer . 
   are we sure poland even knows about all the people murdered ? 
  no , they are rotting on the streets . 
  we have 100,000 police officers , it makes 261 . 
  my source ? 
  http://www.interpol.int/member-countries/europe/poland ** interpol ** . 
  fine enought ? 
  your source is shit , link it here so i can laught . 
  i think * you * might be biased against poland . 
   even if the chance for that is higher than in germany ah yeah , done some digging , look at my other post , i have some fresh data for you . 
   it 's an arbritrary line drawn just like believes , customs , tastes , emotions and everything that makes a human being ... you say `` a king '' but nations were created not only by kings but by peoples will and somehow it is importand for people . 
  it might not be important for you , but do n't say it has no worth . 
  it is like a paper , a coin . 
  at the end it all has no power , it is bit of cellulose or metal that even in raw form has no objective meaning at all , just a lump of mater . 
  but it has meaning for people , for humans . 
  nations are not shaped by kings only , but also by history , by regions , by animals and terrain , by resources , by believes , by climate . 
  you see nations as borders , this is not true . 
  if it would be true then people in africa would n't be murdering each other in the same countries . 
  you have very shallow understanding what a nation is . 
  or just do n't care at all , you are free to do so . 
  just do n't tell people it has no meaning . 
  also to add fresh data : https://data.unodc.org/sys/rpt?reportfile=crime-statistics-homicide-count-data&amp;region=europe&amp;region__label=europe&amp;subregion=eastern%20europe&amp;subregion__label=eastern+europe&amp;country=85&amp;country__label=poland&amp;format=html&amp;fullscreen=true&amp;showtoc=true#state:0 and here https://data.unodc.org/sys/rpt?reportfile=crime-statistics-homicide-count-data&amp;region=europe&amp;region__label=europe&amp;subregion=western%20europe&amp;subregion__label=western+europe&amp;country=118&amp;country__label=germany&amp;format=html&amp;fullscreen=true&amp;showtoc=true#state:0, 
  and these murders are on us , made by our reality , we take responsibility for them and we are going to deal with them in our own way , no need to add external problems into that mix ( and murder is a shortcut , i 'm talking about any form of crime and unrest and tensions ) . 
   and i am not talking for a per-capita basis err  there were a total of 662 murders in germany in 2011  there were a total of 449 murders in poland in 2011 either you are wrong or i do n't know how to read `` not talking for a per-capita basis '', 
  it is not ok to be murdered by pole , i never said that . 
  it is about responsibility for actions , for the country you are building . 
  also , you scold me for thinking in terms of `` the others '' ... well , that 's the problem , people who are flooding en masse your country are thinking just in that terms , for them you are `` the others '' and that 's the biggest problem . 
  and catholics were murdering shit out of people . 
  i 'm not believing in god , you are barking at the wrong tree . 
  but the fact still stands that they grown timmid over these many , many years . 
  you can google numbers yourself . 
   well . . the problem is that you come out at the wrong side of germany well , they were still germans and that 's what i 'm talking about responsibility and building a nation , you are not willing to take them as your responsibility because `` they were commie germans '' . 
  a nation is not a nonsense . 
  wow , you really know how to crook someones words . 
  now read what it would be : it would n't be `` good patriotic '' murder , it would be murder by someone whose background we knew , whose motifs we would understand and upon who our judgement would be full and complete . 
  we could look , as a nation , look victims family in eyes and say `` yes , we as a nation has raised this man in wrong way , his actions are a result of the environment created be us and we are and will be working to create better poland '' . 
  what you can tell ? 
  `` yeah , we let that person in , we know nothing about about that person but hey , you still has bigger chances to be killed by a car ! '', 
  what stinks is your accusation of racism because you can be sure that if * germans * would cause such problems then you would n't be welcomed here either , and that has nothing to do with race and you know that . 
  older polish folks remember how they were welcomed into germany in shortly after ' 89 , with spit and stones . 
  are you including all the mandatory social security contributions ? 
   yeah . . no one is ever murdered in poland . 
  oh come on , do n't pretend it is what i meant but if you want to go that way that way , fine . 
  we at least know * real names * of our people , at least those held for murder . 
   and those `` arguments '' aka prejudice and xenophobia are of course just common sense and only a problem if they are against polish people . 
  polish nationionalism is always wholesome . 
  that 's racist .
