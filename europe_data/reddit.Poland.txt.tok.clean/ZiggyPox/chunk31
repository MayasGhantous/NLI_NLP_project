  they should n't have to do that but oh well . 
  fly like an egyptian . 
  i like new ones better . 
  but there is no other hat so cool as rogatywka ; ), 
  well , i think it is best one we had . 
  interesting bit : http://www.techpedia.pl/files/7853.jpg 4th column and 2nd row is charmingly flamboyant . 
  kinda fluffy , need more pointy bits . 
  can you imagine polish-ukrainian cross ? 
  i 'm not even mad , go go poland rangers !, 
  business is businnes , bodycount is only footnote in the spreadshed ... edit : oh , thanks . 
  do n't tell me that arms dealers see us as something more than datapoint . 
  [ you might be right , but their hats are cooler than original ones ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/1676452-3x2-940x627.jpg ), 
  a whip for a butchers knife !, 
  i have that saying : what 's the difference between russian genocide od european people and german genocide of european people ? 
  speed . 
  for moscow 5 % increase in polish hunting club is a neonazi uprising . 
  for moscow kids learning in russian school how to assemble and disassemble ak47 is just fun and games i think i do n't really care what moscow thinks . 
  pooofff . 
  these were `` accidents '' . 
  they ca n't , it 's cultural appropriation . 
  * so triggered rigt now . . *, 
  reason why it should n't be so is that you give legitimacy to everyones else `` spin '' on real events , i gave example of russians and north korea . 
  you do n't get it , if the author would say `` we tried to recreate how war looks '' it would n't be a lie . 
  the thing is , now * putin *  gasp < can take these photos , say these are staged and that 's a lie . 
  and then he can take any other real photos and say it is too , staged `` because europeans like to stage their war photos '' or other bullshit . 
  you do n't do such a things for * many * reasons and why it goes over you head i ca n't comprehend . 
  that picture is a lie , it did n't happen in the presence of real-life combat but it is presented as such . 
  presentation is the key . 
  so there should be big writting `` dramatization '' down there then . 
  for you it is true what ukrainians are saying ( for me too , but it is n't important now ) . 
  [ that 's what north korea presents as true ] ( http://community.fansshare.com/pic16/w/sinchon-museum-of-american-war-atrocities/1200/21278_sinchon_museum_of_american_war_atrocities.jpg ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinchon_museum_of_american_war_atrocities http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/north-korea-opens-grizzly-new-museum-to-mark-their-kore-1720451315 now , russians can create their own staged photos of * `` poor russian minority raped and nailed to church walls at crimean peninsula '' * presenting them as true ( because * some people * say it happend anyway ) . 
  it is like dressing woman as a witch and then sending her for stake . 
  you believe she 's a witch , they believe she 's a witch , but she is not . 
  is it that complicated ? 
   zobaczkresy.pl site was created for tourists who each year travel to many former lands of polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  the aim of the project is to create an information database in where visitors will be able to find information on places to stay , trails and practical advices on the situations of given countries . 
  zobaczkresy.pl is a tool that allows users to share these informations . 
   many of us are familiar with compatriots living in the kresy from whom you could rent room cheaply for overnight , some probably already had the opportunity to stay in the slowly emerging agro-tourism establishments . 
  this site was created so that we have place to shared our experiences . 
  google translated with minimal correction because i 'm lazy . 
   http://www.kresy.pl/ that 's one interesting webpage . 
  i think you responded to wrong comment . 
  immigrant or not , i do n't thing they would be any bit sad . 
  still i 'm sure they are n't even bit sad . 
  but . . they are like . . banned ? 
  ooooh , i get it !, 
  do n't worry , someone will soon come and tell you how it is blown out of proportions or something . 
  it alwasy happens to me . 
  not in every corner of the internet , no . 
  also , i like how `` f * '' looks and how everyone gets what it means while , on the other hand , many probably wo n't know what c * means at the first glance . 
  a cool picture altered to obscure or change meaning and/or even , then presented as real , is nothing but a f * fat * lie * . 
   summerjob oh you cute younglings ... 
  what is that h\u0306\u0314\u0312\u0310\u0312\u036a\u0302\u036f\u0322\u031e\u031do\u0314\u0357\u0314\u0307\u034c\u0365\u030a\u0328\u0334\u0338\u033c\u034d\u0326\u0319\u0345\u031em\u0342\u0367\u036c\u0336\u0338\u0323\u0325\u0333\u0320\u035a\u032ao\u0369\u0307\u0352\u034c\u0357\u033e\u0321\u0335\u0327\u031e\u0318\u032c\u0323\u0349\u035as\u034b\u0303\u0306\u0364\u0344\u0363\u0322\u0337\u0331\u031d\u032f\u033a\u032e\u0324e\u0343\u0363\u031b\u0338\u0321\u0319\u032e\u0316\u0324\u032c\u0318x\u0307\u035b\u0313\u035b\u036c\u0328\u033b\u032e you are talking about ? 
  i ca n't read it , all i get is that funny static noise . 
  i do n't think there is harsher language in sound than german , to be honest ; ), 
  flak in polish means gut , flaki : guts . 
  and then i remember a moment from wolfenstein when plane was under flak fire and soldeirs `` flaki '' were hanging out of their bellies . 
  icky . 
  and thorn has `` jo '' . 
  one word with infinite meanings . 
  polish grammar is the least of your worries . 
  wait 'til your husband sees polish girls . 
   but city dwellers would use the more politically correct or use `` dziewka '' just to spread confusion . 
  did she bite ? 
  sorry ... could n't resist ... 
   rich , pole choose one . 
  i would call it a true friend ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  what madness is that ??? 
  because i was at work and then had to do my groceries and then take my cat to vet and now i 'm drinking beer , reading internet ( your link including ) and working on setting up my portfolio . 
  it is kinda awkward that i have to explain my daily shedule . 
  who said i 'm not interested ? 
  kid wants sausage , they removed sausage because someone was offended . 
  one option less , not more . 
  they say putinbots , they say paid trolls , but i really think * some * people believe that ... 
  hello there , i would like to remind myself and ask again for source of that poster and where comes that claim of it being polish poster . 
  i found it goes to `` polishforums.com '' but there is no topic i can look into . 
  because these are considered companion animals in western culture . 
  in hong kong and taiwan too . 
  just like banning pork in school cafeteria . 
  pandering to one xenophobes or another . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-mask_laws you can stop wondering . 
  no harm done , no sorry needed . 
  there is nothing wrong in informing people, 
  just as u/sulod said . 
  it works on many sites because they are cookies based . 
  i do n't reset my modem every time i want to read news lol . 
  i know that incognito mode is n't tor ... 
  not really , it works for me on many websites and beside that dynamic ip helps . 
  incognito mode ? 
  i want a hat with that on front . 
   this is n't the polish-lithuanian commonwealth being reformed . 
  it 's what we want you to think . 
  ** muhahahahaha **, 
   you ignore that a lot of the spending is n't spent on benefits for refugees but on employing people , building stuff etc. 
  i do n't really like that argument . 
  this way you can justify our bloated bureaucracy `` because money will come back anyway '' . 
  or another olympic stadion . 
  that 's burned money and burned time . 
  my cat is named `` kitty '' and i 'm not even joking ... 
  you are mixing things .
