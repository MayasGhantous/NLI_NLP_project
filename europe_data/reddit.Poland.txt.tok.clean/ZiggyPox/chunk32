  of course 12 yo girl and 12 yo boy can consent to sex , the thing is an * adult * can not have sex even with even consenting minor , it is why this is called * statutory rape * . 
  kids can want what they want , but adults 1 . can use their influence to abuse and make them think what they want by manipulation/dependence/influence ( that is one of the reasons why teachers even * after * age of consent are forbidden from engaging in sexual relationship with a student ) and 2 . adults are having different responsibilities . 
  it is on the same level that you can legally accuse an adult for giving an alcohol to minor , but not minor to minor . 
  well , news articles about that stabbing are from like 17 october 2015 so ... first she got stabbed and then she made up that genius advice . 
  somehow it sounds worse . 
  a modest proposal , eh ? 
  one day you are working your ass off to make to your retirement , other day it is not enought .

  we just need to promote more of that progressive assisted suicide for the old people , they ca n't make any money anyways / s,

  what do you mean , my dear neofite ? 
  of course it is road wars , a burning place under scorching sun , where angels , under a reign of a saint , can spread their wings and crush the infidels on the fields of the ash !,

  oh you are right , but they wo n't refuse some pretty donations for campaign here , some comfy office work for someones nice there in exchange for some comfy law from time to time . 
  i 'm not saying that 1 % lizardmen are ruling our world , i say they are buying chunks of little peoples world in terms of space , laws and freedoms . 
  there is difference between romanian 1 % and global 1 % just as there is difference in infuelnce that political class has there * and * then there is usa 1 % , ** the ** 1 % everyone has been talking about . 
  ah , you are * romanian * 1 % ... 
  okay . 
  oh like hell you are 1 % mate , if so then i 'm a british queen . 
  it is when you put a spicy root into a bum so spanked person wo n't clench cheeks when spanked . 
  have fun , play responsibly . 
  and i do n't read their sites . 
  i do n't care that much for their clickbaits . 
  internet articles quaility could go back * at least * to the level they were on 10 years ago then maybe ... and this is still low bar . 
  oh how lovely . 
   costs of living in warsaw are in the ** least expensive 20 percent ** of all 217 teleport cities ** and the most expensive in poland ** . 
  moving to warsaw will ** very likely decrease your daily costs ** of living . 
  mfw i 'm a phleb and i ca n't live in my own capitol  :(, 
  i only send memes throught facebook . 
  i find reddit better and getting quaility feed beside directly following creators websites , who at the same time update their facebook pages . 
  you do n't get your anus this red by just spanking . 
  this is not how you spank someone . 
  unless figging , but i do n't think many people know about figging . 
  that butt got epic rape , it will be sore for looong time . 
  i 'm not even sorry . 
  i 'm getting my paycheck from both cia and kgb .

  where 's my notebook ? 
  i know , see , i drink * radler * that has little % too . 
  i 've written it in small text :p, 
  that is silly way to react . 
  write to his boss an angry letter . 
  send it by conventional mail for extra points . 
  he did wrong during his job by doing his job so it justifies . 
  where 's fun in that ??

  syrians ran away but there are ones who stayed . 
  if isis would come here where would we run away ? 
  to russia ? 
  then where ? 
  to china ? 
  we would run away until we find a nation that has enought balls to fight for what is theirs . 
  or die . 
  it 's not ideology of patriotism , it is really about survival as a group . 
  there is moment when you have to run away but if you only run away there is no reason why your enemy would even stop going after you . 
  my father was a soldier so it might have something to do with my overlook . 
  but then you linked to emigration that was * after failed uprising * , and most of emigrating people were soldiers and inteligensia . 
  the best way to save your family is to let them run and stay yourself to fight , otherwise one nation that does not run away would be turned conqueror in the world of runners . 
  lets pretend we are running with guns becasue weather is lovely ? 
  naaah , ukrane got its cheek wooped and member cut away , we all know why we are doing this . 
  it seems you find it to be a problem that people are talking about `` something that happend 75 years ago '' and , in return , i find that troubling . 
  something something got invaded ... 
  i remember when i was just a snot and in 2000 everyone was talkin `` will you stop talking about something that was 60 years ago ? '' . 
  my parents remember 1990 when people wanted to talk about about soviet invasion , because they could , and even there were people saying `` god , it was 50 years ago ! '' . 
  * i * will be talking about all that in next 25 years so deal with it . 
  no , it is full of amber wanting to reunite with poland . 
  [ look at this cute amber cat and tell it that it ca n't be polish , tell it !,

  * i * think * we * would take that hit anyway , so meh ... 
  well , whatever rustles your jimmies . 
  see , we did fight russians but we like to , like , * not * killing each other ? 
  if steamrolling over poor people and making new terrorists is your idea of `` power '' then be my guest , you had good teachers after all in doing just that . 
  if poland would do that everyone would go bonkers , including us , nato , russia and even poles . 
  oh you are absolutely right . 
  it 's just , i do n't want to hit russians while being against their gov. 
  i 'm aware i ca n't have both things . 
  that 's a reactor , unsmart . 
  i 'm asking about the fissile elements . 
  are there mines in dimona ? 
  what you put in that reactor , magic dust ? 
  crimea shall forever stay a sorepoint in our relationships . 
  tactics of `` waiting over the outrage '' should not be encouraged . 
  how long should * we '' sit on kaliningrad oblast to make russia wave it way as a loss ? 
  there is no such amount of time . 
  i would rather have a russia state that stops being a huge dick . 
  i do n't want common russians to be antagonized toward eu . 
  be careful now , you can cut yourself on that edge . 
  allegated nuclear weapon and even then , i wonder from where they would get fissile material . 
  it would be hard without that to break another egnigma . 
  only when they bring it here . 
  their presence here makes them part of our culture , and we have a say , and i would even say that we have a strong voice as a host , in how our culture should look .
