  this or parallel societies and that is big no-no .

  '' , i think it is primitive enought ?

  you can get used to it he he heh ... 
  tell us after we buldozer some russian settlements and then you can accuse us of parallel bravado . 
  until then our 89 ' should suffice as a proof that we can oppose russia without support of nato . 
  edit : wow , someone got hurt over there ? 
  do n't recall any pope statue founded by eu , money goes from the church and believers . 
  we ca n't get money from eu for anything that eu did n't acknowledged in its budget tee-hee . 
  you are showing fundamental lack in knowledge how eu works . 
  also i would take 3 popes and 2 kaczy\u0144skis over your ottoman erdogan ; ) . 
  heh , that 's a fun thing to hear . 
  very ... `` western '' of you , indeed . 
  without us big brother these would be only empty words .

  plz invest in polish jokes . 
  jezus , that guy is bonkers !, 
  not only that , but people are bouncing with him to the same tune . 
  that poor hamster ... 
  oh lovely , i have 1 reasone against : just imagine sheer number of preservatives needed in that foodstuff . 
  half-finished product we are allready having on the shelves are full of preservatives like salts and sugars . 
  mom , dad ... 
  how people * dare * to be outraged !, 
  nah man , they came to make fuss about nothing . 
  i 'm sure there were one or two black people that get into a brawl with some stupid racists here in poland , that would be enought of an argument for them to start their stupid games . 
  i think i will allow that , dear `` someone somewhere '' ; ), 
   some fat officer pretending to be the commander . 
  this part here is proof itself that you are telling the truth hehe . 
  are you connected to army in any way ? 
  to be honest , russians really , really liked their maps : http://www.wired.com/2015/07/secret-cold-war-maps/, 
  i can volunteer to personally tidy this region it all by myself if only to get my hands on these tasty tasty amber mines ... amber mines ... mmmmm ... 
  aw come on , someone somewhere finds this funny . 
  i do n't . 
  hahaha , oh god . . we would n't even know that they were there . 
  goddamn blazkowicz where are you ? 
  so by averge ... grey ? 
  hans , are we the baddies ? 
  we also had some humour but it all died out when germans came . 
  i can do it all day . 
  it was only matter of time and speed . 
  germans had their own uranprojekt , they just did n't manage to be the first ... or second ha !, 
   i will try to ** rationalize ** use of nukes but remember i do n't justify them [ a. 
  to explain or justify ( one 's behavior ) with incorrect reasons or excuses , often without conscious awareness : rationalized his poor academic performance by claiming the teacher was incompetent . 
  ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rationalize )  big talk or just flailing around it is exacly what it is . 
  i will try to rationalize use of nukes but remember i do n't justify them : nuclear is not only a bomb , it is a poison and it also marks you , you need to nuge one or two centers , general area and chokepoints , you kill , you weaken and you mark anyone dangerous that was in the region , with radiation that will be picked by geiger counter . 
  also you are lighter off your humanity . 
  you should n't assume that people with genocidal tendencies would follow common sense . 
  hey , i 'm not saying i want that , or that this is good idea , or that it is just . 
  it is * none * of that . 
  what i said is when you nuke something not much is left really . 
  people were allready nuked , mind that ... 
  i think i have solution : be poor as poland ? 
  that 's a joke btw . 
  well , to the moment . 
  it is really hard to stard jihad with handfull irradiated guys . 
   you prefer the `` let them kill us , we are pussies '' left ? 
  i said  i do n't mind right so what 's the answer in your opinion ? 
  jezus on the stick , that thing is * vile * as fuck . 
  this part , copied from the wiki : `` naji suggests that a long-lasting strategy of attrition will reveal fundamental weaknesses in the ability of superpowers to defeat committed jihadists '' . 
  this whole strategy is based on the fact that west is trying to stay as humane and civilized but every action has a reaction ... west is turning right , i do n't mind right but * i do n't * want * far * right , nazi right , `` lets nuke them , turn that desert into glass and be done '' savage right . 
  maybe ireland too ? 
  we are nature . 
  help , it 's a polonophobe !, 
  anti-polonist ? 
  pole-hater ? 
  oh well , lets move on . 
  about doing bad things for self-preservation ... 
  i think i 'll stop there because i could say , using your logic of doing anything for self-preservation , something about * szmalcownik * but it itself would be so vile that i would feel dirty by doing so . 
  just remeber that : not everything can be justified . 
  you can say poles were stealing from jews who left their goods in their abandoned homes because they were starving/bribing germans for their lifes but it was not good , it was wrong ... about that poster ... from where do you get it ? 
  where it was written that this was polish poster ? 
  that was german propaganda aimed at antagonizing poles against jews , our ipn ( institute of national remembrance ) has even a page with it : http://polska1918-89.pl/ludobojstwo-niemieckie-na-polskich-zydach,223.html here you can find more : http://karta.org.pl/fotooferty/jlw_spp/ppages/ppage26.htm it was collected and archivised by underground gov as a proof of actions of germans against polish jews . 
  i think copy is in radom national archive in poland http://www.szukajwarchiwach.pl/58/1192/0/14/483#tabjednostka it goes like that : \u017byd to oszust , jedyny tw\u00f3j wr\u00f3g . 
  ( jew is a swindler , your only enemy ) sta\u0144 , przeczytaj widzu mi\u0142y , ( stay , read , dear vewer ) jak ci\u0119 \u017cydy osaczy\u0142y , ( how jews has surround you ) brudn\u0105 wod\u0119 da do mleka , ( dirty water will add to milk ) zamiast mi\u0119sa szczura sieka , ( in place of meat minces rats ) rozczyn ciasta z robakami , ( leaven dought with bugs ) ugniatany jest nogami . 
  ( is kneaded by foot ) this is awkward . 
  my girlfriends aunt is in germany sinse ... 1989 , i kinda know the market there ; ) and i was half-joking half-serius . 
  u/culmensis got his post removed and a warning for a broad generalisation , i was talking about a section , what i noted , a section , a smal % of jews who did colaborate , few bad apples , i named their function and reasons why i find it as colaboration and not desperate need for self-preservation and i also stated that they did not represent , in any way , jews as a whole society . 
  all you remembered was * `` jews were ` in cooperation ' with nazis '' . 
  * how should i read it ? 
  for sure it is abuse of word `` anti-semitic '' but what else ? 
  i wo n't inquire about palestine any more . 
   upvoted comments by the other pole whom stated ` jews have a monopoly on suffering ' first , you ca n't know that and second , i did not , so now you know . 
   lacks the legitimicy to dictate what is immoral and/or moral because i 'm a pole ?
