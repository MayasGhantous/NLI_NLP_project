   there is absolutely no comparison between the anti-semitism in central europe in some parts , there is not , israeli state is nor bad as to start pogroms . 
  on the other hand a modern country behaves in such way . 
  you expect poles to understand suffering of jews because we were under russia foot but you ca n't understand palestinian ones despite hollocaust ? 
  story of that girl was caught on camera , what about all others where there was no camera but there is bunch of dead kids ? 
  i know it is a shitty situation but come on you know it is n't good what happens to palestinians . 
  just answer this , is there unjustified abuse toward palestinians ? 
  yes or no ? 
  is it huge problem ? 
  yes or no ? 
  you again removed your comment but i wo n't let it go this time , it is too important . 
   i 'm angry how they are acting toward palestinians , persecutions toward them are sometimes no better than  you do realise your hypocrisy though ? 
  you insulted jews in the past few comments , claimed some theories which were nasty . 
  poland did something like this ghetto benches and polls say anti-semitism is high in today 's poland . 
   i am actually suprised , i thought due to their practices in poland when it comes to their religion , most would support israel ( poles are also aware of the dangers of radical islam which is why they do n't accept refugees ) . 
  so how can you not explaion the support from this perspective ? 
  and i asked about the polish perspective , not yours specifically . 
  and polish nationilism does exist , i 'm not too sure what you 're suggesting . 
   as for russia , from their perspective at least , they seem threatened that many former states joined europe , that 's all i 'm saying . 
  for them it seems like poland and others do n't want good relations with them , agree ? 
  my naswer :  you do realise your hypocrisy though ? 
  should i say now that you are anty-polonistic ? 
  nah , we did some bad things in the past and i 'm sorry for that , my ancestors were n't people of today but it does n't justify them . 
  the thing is , why israel wants to be as bad now as my ancestors were there ? 
  wrongdoings of poles does n't justify wrongdoings of israeli state . 
  if you define anti-semitism as beliefs that `` israeli policeman bullying little girl and stealing her bike is bad '' then sorry , noone will care anymore for anti-semitism . 
  accustation of anti-semitism was a sharp , hurting rethoric but now , by doing what you are doing it is getting dull , impotent and people just do n't care anymore . 
  `` i think saying that poland caused holocaust is a lie '' = anti-semitism `` i wo n't buy products made in stolen lands '' = anti-semitism `` killing palestinian kids is bad '' = anti-semitism if anti-semitism argument is used in this case what does it tell about anti-semitism ? 
  it is good that israel is at that region , it is bad what israel is doing to individual innocent palestinians , it is good that israel fights against extremists , it is bad that by persecutions they create another extremists . 
  you can do good and bad at the same time . 
   polish nationilism does exist , i 'm not too sure what you 're suggesting . 
  polish nationalism is frown upon , israeli one is daily life . 
  and russia has a crooked view on the world , it is their problem . 
  i would starve little bit and freelance on black market as a designer , move money to poland to my mom then i myself would move to norway , get caught working on black market , go to jail and be there taught carpentry . 
  i have it all figured out !, 
  ... i 'm a graphic designer with an art degree made in university of thorn lol . 
  wan na buy some linocuts or etchings ? 
  of israel itself ? 
  i do n't know really , i 'm personally on a fence here all the time . 
  i wish long and prosperous life for them and i think that jews needs their place on earth but at the same time i 'm angry how they are acting toward palestinians , persecutions toward them are sometimes no better than what happend to jews themselfes in some other countries , how israeli * patriotism * would be calles * nationalism * in poland if poles would exhibit such actions , double standards here , holocaust blaming there , sometimes * `` polish death camps '' * ... 
  but it is all about state , not that it is * jewish * state . 
  if it was usa or , dunno , germany or czechia doing that we would be angry just the same . 
  but some poles hate israel just becasue it is full of jews , i wo n't pretend , we have that kind of people here . 
  russia is provoked by anything that is n't refederalization , i 'm sure that `` provoked '' is its permanent state . 
  russia was abusive toward its satelite states and we are not going to pretend it were n't . 
  we also ca n't turn new leaf in our relationships because people in power there are nothing more than trainees molded and trained by previous russian gov. 
  automod removed my post : ( well , we had this , google : polish-neo-nazi-skinhead-couple-discover-jewish but on serious note : http://www.timesofisrael.com/polish-hidden-jews-embrace-hip-ancestry/ we have also this : http://jri-poland.org/?gclid=clnrir68p84cfue_gwodppqjva resources : http://www.isragen.org.il/sitefiles/1/455/7873.asp  you are suggesting them to fight a fight they will likely loose ? 
  nah , i 'm suggesting to not antagonize minorities , build strong national identity ( many ukrainians did n't even know ukrainian language and russia used that as an argument ) , build politics of assimilation etc. 
  what happend was only end resoult of series of mistakes , you might say a car crash in mid-air and you buckle your belt before car crash . 
  after thar it 's only collecting the pieces . 
  errr ... there are probably lots of poles with jewish ancestry but the first question is if they even know that . 
  second , if they know that they had jew somewhere in their family tree so what of it ? 
  i have germans roots somewhere there on maternal side so who knows , maybe even jewish ones ? 
  but i do n't care , i 'm a pole . 
  about ukraine ... hmm ... my grandpa was fighting against ukrainian insurgent army , some people are bitter but i wish the best for ukrainians . 
  i think as you go east you would find more angry people . 
  oh , their lands are theirs , they only could take little better care of their identity as a nation as to prevent another `` minorities '' of being `` liberated '' by `` russian tourists '' . 
   get 3x 4x times that what i am doing with my life and why is n't it happening in france ? 
  but but . . that was meant to be * surprise !, 
  you can easilly google answer for that : 1.1 ) http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/260596,poland-among-safest-european-countries-for-jews-holocaust-foundation-chief 1.2 ) http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/poland_is_the_safest_place_in_europe_for_jews_today 1.3 ) http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/polish_government_wants_to_take_over_upgrade_treblinka_museum 1.4 ) http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/marking_70th_anniversary_of_jewish_massacre_polish_president_slams_anti_sem but every second article you can find is like that : 2 ) http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/belarusian_nobel_prize_laureate_accuses_poles_of_persecuting_jews_in_holoca also there are some nice fiddlings with numbers : 3 ) http://forward.com/news/world/191155/poland-poll-reveals-stubborn-anti-semitism-amid-je/ and quote is formed like that  the study also found an 8 percent increase in more traditional forms of anti-semitism , ** including blaming jews for the murder of jesus christ and the belief that christian blood is used in jewish rituals . 
  some 23 % were found to hold such traditional , religious-based beliefs about jews . 
  ** and then you end with guys like u/nokmim1948 who says stuff like that :  almost 1/4 of poles think jews use christian blood in their rituals . 
  that 's the study : http://cbu.psychologia.pl/uploads/f_winiewski/pps2%20raporty/raport_antysemityzm_ang.pdf they put these two things in one bracket and made it the same thing . 
  it would be the same like asking questions `` do you think that poles are anti-semite ( lets say 88 % of answers ) '' and `` do you think that poland was perpetrator of holocaust ( lets say 2 % ) '' , then you dress answer into something like they did here `` 90 % of jews hold antagonistic believs against poland like that poles are anti-semites and that poland was perpetrator of holocaust '' . 
  on personal level ? 
  i met 2 jews that i 'm aware they were jews because they told me so , i 've met probably much more and did n't know that and i 'm not counting those i 've just seen in krakow while visiting synagogue and jewish graveyard ( kippah is a giveaway in that case ) . 
  i know sometimes people gets into a brawl for wearing kippah . 
  i think it is your problem that you find every * legit * critique as an anti-semitic act . 
  go defend some more policemen bullying kids or something . 
  damn , i fucked up . 
  that was n't a policeman , that was a soldier : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gf6zp/portuguese_student_victim_of_racist_attack_in/ but then there was a follow up ( please use google translator ) : http://rzeszow-news.pl/nie-bylo-incydentu-bedzie-sledztwo-przeciwko-portugalczykom i think there was no update of the followup here on reddit , no drama no karma . 
  also they said we hate gays and that we were voting against them : https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4ou4ry/poland_together_with_russia_iran_and_several_gulf/ but our msz says not really ( again , you could use google translate ) http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/7,114881,20255677,nie-dla-dekryminalizacji-homoseksualizmu-polska-w-onz-ramie.html#boxnewslink so now we are racist catholic homophobes and i 'm not even mad . 
  but sir , i 'm allready french , ca n't you tell by my accent ? 
   while poles often end up there for smuggling alcohol/tobacco . 
  you reject our cultural exports ? 
  i 'm not even sorry . 
   735 $ / mo my faint heart ca n't take it ... more eu fundz plz ? 
  do n't worry , there sure are some poles for hire to do that job for you . 
  ... pfff . 
  * fine * , i laughted . 
   450 euros viva la france , i 'm packing my stuff , welcome high life !, 
  policeman in poland pushed dark-skinned kid and it made to the international news because we are racist or something . 
  you can get used to that . 
  errr , breake a window using an infant ? 
  it was funny without reference . 
  now it is just pure masterpiece . 
  many people do n't . 
  i absolutely agree with you here . 
   still do n't understand why eastern europeans have the same voice in the eu parliament as the rest , does n't make any sense . 
  because your inner conviction of supremacy is resurfacing . 
  if one little silly inferior poland can stir your eu then your eu is n't so great in the first place . 
  give us money or leave yourself or kick us out or talk to us like equals : ) you can only be angry because you ca n't do anything about that . 
  inferiority complex vs control freak , who will win ? 
  this saturday evening on x-treme sports !, 
  i want to be imprisoned in norway . 
  going to norway , burning your papers , breaking a window or two , getting jailed , becoming a carpenter with a skill , how that sounds ? 
  i think `` we 're not that incompetent '' would be enought . 
   the study also found an 8 percent increase in more traditional forms of anti-semitism , including blaming jews for the murder of jesus christ and the belief that christian blood is used in jewish rituals . 
  some 23 % were found to hold such traditional , religious-based beliefs about jews . 
  in one bracket * `` blaming jews for the murder of jesus christ '' * with * `` christian blood is used in jewish rituals '' * . 
  what is separation for that ?
