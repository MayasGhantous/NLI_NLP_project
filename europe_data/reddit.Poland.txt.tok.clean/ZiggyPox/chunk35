  this is dishonest and manipulative . 
  it is like asking question * `` do you think that poles are anti-semite ( 88 % of answers ) '' * and * `` do you think that poland was perpetrator of holocaust ( 2 % ) '' * , then you dress answer into something like * `` 90 % of jews believes that poles are anti-semites and that poland was perpetrator of holocaust '' * http://cbu.psychologia.pl/uploads/f_winiewski/pps2%20raporty/raport_antysemityzm_ang.pdf this is shitty answer-grouping . 
  heh , like when ? 
  i 'm not talking about riots , i 'm talking about line worker going into his boss office with a pointy stick or a pistol . 
  even whole batch of hellfire rockets wo n't help then, 
   were you promised to become the country receiving more donations from the eu budget than anyone else ? 
  can i see a link to that agreement ? 
  it so happens that we get the most , it is not our fault that other countries had different deal ... or you are saying we are somehow * forcing * eu to pay us tribute ? 
  wow , what huge power must poland hold !, 
   yeah yeah . 
  your pm already told us all that were were all nazi collaborators and therefore ca n't criticize you . 
  yes , you were selling them iron with wich they were killing us and you say that pointing this out is reason for resenting poles . 
  oh wow , so what feelings should i feel toward you ? 
   no they are not you 're own politics as long as you have a say in eu parliament . 
  as a xenophobic country we managed quite well world youth days , the question is : was it thanks to our xenophoby or despite our xenophoby ? 
  * oh we will never know * . 
  also you are anti-polonistic therfore your arguments are n't vaild ( see , i can also play `` you racist '' game ) . 
   bff with nazis and openly hostile to uss https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war oh , and germans had to yet starting killing million of jews , sorry for trying to * not * start a war . 
   when was it ? 
  how many decades ago ? 
  we were still killed by secret police under communist regime , as a * consequence of selling us to russia * , thank you very much . 
   clear inferiority complex we are told that we irrational , fearmongering * and * warmongering , victim-playing , anti-semites , backward , european money-sink , euro-mexico . 
  amazing , really , from where this complex might come ? 
  poland is n't based on anti-semitism but i think i will stop this discussion . 
  i do n't like to talk to people who in half-way throught doscussion are removing their comments . 
  i could copy it with my answer that i have written , but i lost my patience . 
  i 'm not indifferent , you just sound like someone who is n't aware how bad it was for poles in poland too . 
  also you send mixed messages , but that 's other thing . 
  naaah , i 'm a very lovely and warm person but i 'm cold when we are doing gross ( lol ) generalizations . 
  if pole directly participated in murder he was a murderer , if jew kapo directy participated in choosing other jews for executions , if he was beating to death other prisoners , he was a murder , i do n't know why you even brought that because that was not the argument . 
  what i said is that , by your logic , a pole who was visited by german with order `` show us where jews are or otherwise we might kill you '' would be a victim , because that would be a pararell to judenrats but you had to , somehow , spin it around murderers . 
  i 'm not sarcastic , that was n't even sarcasm , my society is n't shitty ( we do n't occupy any land at the moment for example ) and fix that nasty habit of yours with writting `` poles '' `` germans '' and other nationalities with lower case . 
  errr . . that is bad , bad thing to say . 
  by the same standard every pole who gave away jews to germans was also a victim . . they were forced . 
  this is bad . 
  jewish getto police ? 
  you had few bad apples that were in co-operation with nazis . 
  taking judenrats , they werent ' t numerous but damage was immense . 
   almost 1/4 of poles think jews use christian blood in their rituals . 
  for that i would like a source , yeah . 
  satanism is the same as christianity , just playing for the other team ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / joke, 
  you just did that ? 
  yeah sure . 
  is ha-kotel ha-maarawi also calculated for making money ? 
  is denkmal f\u00fcr die ermordeten juden europas made for money ? 
  be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp ? 
  radegast train station ? 
  treblinka extermination camp ? 
  and this link only prooves that polish gov does care . 
  if it did n't it would n't call for help . 
  lol , yeah . 
  and we did n't burn auschwitz to the ground after a war because russians wanted too to turn it into vacation spot . 
  you are saying that if people would n't come from all over the world to see auschwitz it would go down . 
  first , you have no proof for that corelation and second have many not-so-popular museums that are still doing fine . 
   if it did n't make money it would be in much worse shape than it is now . 
  well well well , someone is going to feel silly now because i 'm coming back with a nice source to stomp over your nonsense : http://auschwitz.org/en/museum/finances/ here , on their own webpage , they say they do n't make enought money and 1/3rd is allready subsidized by our government . 
  now i 'm waiting , please , spin it around to turn it into moneygrab scheme . 
  i 'm sure you know something i do n't . 
  please !, 
  enlighten me !, 
  i need your guidiance . 
  yes , that 's my angry face . 
  who demands money ? 
  we demands what we were promised to be paid for opening our markets toward giants who could swallow us easilly . 
  that money is recompense for that . 
  second , we could n't wash away our hands from that war as you did . 
  also our current politics are our politics , enjoy your waves of immigrants while we enjoy our stable society , nobody forces you to live here or even think about poland . 
  we are fine thank you very much . 
  also russia is anexing piece by piece lands close to its borders , trying spin around how they were saviors of europe at the same time washing their hands off their own crimes during wwii , that 's not unhealthy obsession , that 's just saying how things are . 
  lastly we can play victim card because we were victims , murdered , raped , gassed , burned and shot to death . 
  we are a free country * hardly * a generation , trying to build our own future and * some people * are having nerve to tell us what we should do . 
  we are tired of being told what we should and should n't do so do n't ever bother . 
  i hope you find my answer satisfactory . 
  oh yeah , that are huge downs of such thing and i remember that hahah . 
  there was period of gross-o-mania and self flagellation . 
  but only thanks to that i get interested in * real * history . 
  no , as a citizen of ex-plaything of soviets i 'm honestly happy for you . 
  my maaaan , i love that attitude !, 
  be free , be proud !, 
  well , it has its ups and downs . 
  for example , i 'm learning history and i gained quite respect toward historians . 
  this guy is great , is n't it ? 
  he will throw accustations like a machinegun but he wo n't adress any point inconvinient for him . 
   200,000 warsaw citizens but no moment of silence for the 3 million polish jews ? 
  we are keeping auschwitz in one piece as an evidence and reminder for the future , warsaw citizens have one moment of silience in year . 
  we are spreading polish feawer . 
  do you feel uncontrollable carving for ponczkis and pathological attraction to kielbasa ? 
  do n't fight it . 
  the one waiting for me at home is more special than others , 
  potato comes , potato goes , polska is 4 ever . 
  ... the hell ? 
   corporate lobbyists a.k.a. 
  experts ? 
  they present themselfes as experts . 
  i think that 's why people are tired of experts nowdays . 
  capitalism is a binge-eating cow nowdays . 
  the moment it eats more than it gives people that will be the moment of slaughter . 
  people are aaangry , they have no time for themselfes , no time to start a family , no time for self-development , no nothing that would make their lifes worthwhile . 
  how long till we se another wave of people ** going postal ** ? 
  but this time not only on post offices ?
