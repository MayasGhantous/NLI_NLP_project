  they do care . 
  white collars gave themselfes nice pat on the back for marvelous cuts in expenses . 
  they are soooo smart . 
  dunno , i was always very criticizing of the managing of current immigration crisis to the point where i had to voice my harsh opinions on the other subreddits ( ones that shall not be named ) demanding * just the thing that these people are doing right now * , treating these people like adults , teaching them rules of our society and demanding them to abide to said rules . 
  well , they are still little bit patronizing in doing so but that 's great start , even if little late but still the right thing to do . 
  only one other better thing to do would be to turn time back and redo all thing but i do n't see any volunteers . 
  it just blows my mind . 
  we all know that , we told them before , we were called racists and now we are proven right and they wrong . 
  we should be happy , but i am not , damage is done and i must say it is one of the best ideas they had in all that affair . 
   will call you racist i find it only annoying when people use this as an argument . 
  it just does n't stick . 
  being a polack might have something to do with that . 
   why do some poles on r/europe have to boast about how great poland is ? 
  because you did n't invest in eastern poland that 's why now go and fix that !, 
  have you tried . . like . . be nice to them ? 
  it works for me . 
  i am fine with taking our jobs . 
  live long and prosper now , * friend * , what about our women ? 
   but ok , i can say right now that you are right , that we were vile and hienous , i will say so if you answer me one question that irks me so much right now . . maybe , but it is just what i promised \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  well , not enterily nazi propaganda . 
  quote from wiki : * `` some 37,1 % of post-war management of ub ( ubp ) employees and members of the communist authorities in poland were of jewish origin . 
  '' * and source : http://www.bibula.com/?p=65251 based on * biuletyn ipn -- 11/2005 * in times where jews were making 1 % of society . 
  but other interesting part is that kbw that was under ubp direct control was taking major role in kielce pogrom . 
  i has that saying of mine that it does n't matter if someone is of polish or jewish or russian or german origin ... communist is just communist , nothing more . 
  so as i promised : we were vile and bad and criminal and you are right . 
  i 'm getting easily fixated on minor things . 
  it 's not conspiracy , it is either very consistent bad habit or some prejudice resurfacing here , i 'm not sure wich one . 
   i do capitalize poland you only capitalize it at the start of the sentence , not in the middle  ** p ** olish ** j ** ewish society collectively during the time did n't hate ** p ** oles , period . 
  this is awkward . 
  i mentioned it twice because first time you did n't adress it first time . 
  another interesting snipped , we renounced that treaty later anyway , * beside * the part about minorities . 
  but ok , i can say right now that you are right , that we were vile and hienous , i will say so if you answer me one question that irks me so much right now ... why you do n't capitalize other nations and nationalities names ( ** p ** oles , ** p ** oland , ** g ** ermans , ** g ** ermany ) but you do capitalize '' ** j ** ews '' ? 
  it 's looks almost on purpose because it 's perfect and you do n't skip a beat in doing so , so you ca n't just say you do n't care . 
  was n't jewish support for communism little bit overstated ? 
  i 'm not fresh in the subject but as far as remember numbers are bit hazzy and abused from time to time . 
  quote : `` you poles will see , after germans come we will build bridges out of your heads '' . 
  source : my dead grandma . 
  as i said , individual case , it is n't telling a thing about jewish society , what i noted , ( * `` fact of being jews was a coincidence '' * ~ me ) please stop defending every random jew like it is an attack on every jew . 
  also on the side note , you might start capitalizing every other nationality than jews , i see you are quite consisten in using lower case for everyone else . 
  please , tell me why jews were so numerous in poland because you are eluding main points i 'm making ( little treaty of versailles being another one ) . 
  i do n't blame jews for antisemitism , i blame society that was a clusterfuck after world war i and century of partition under foreign rule , there were no polish government at that time and when poland went pack into hand of poles our gov tried quite hard to fix that ( eg . 
  little treaty of versailles ) . 
  well , it is not exacly true , i blame few jews of my great-grandma antisemitism , but it 's because of what they did to her as humans , not as jews , fact of being jews was a coincidence and easy point for her to focus her anger . 
  oh and * they * did hate poles , but as i said , it is individual case . 
  jews were n't assimilated and that is a fact , cronyism was also a major issue that was antagonizing us and lastly vile hatred was coming from both sides , it is not excuse , it 's analyse of situation . 
  poles did n't like jews becasue jews did n't like poles because poles did n't like jews . 
  one side was less numerous and also on * worse * terms with nazists , that 's bad luck . 
  well , during wwi there were only around 400 jews in polish legions and after wwi there was very strong need for autonomy from jewish people . 
  not that i justify antisemitism , but this and similar things did n't help fighting it . 
  also if we were * that * antisemitic how comes poland was a country where jews could live in most numerous diasporas ? 
  as i said somewhere else , in context of these times i do n't think we were * that * bad . 
  from todays perspective it sure was horrible but these were different times and i think we made some progress . 
  also , century before wwii there was no poland : ), 
  ok , without source , lets be honest here ... there was antisemitism in poland and from todays perspective it is bad but during interwar period antisemitism was prevalent in maaaany european countries . 
  but some make it sound like onlyu in poland antisemitism was an issue . 
  you are talking about israel or poland ? 
   there is really no discussion exept on reddit or in poland : ^ ), 
  i know what point you wanted to make because israeli are pretty biased against poles but i do n't blame you for that . 
  people often do n't know , do n't have guts or do n't have proof to fight for what is theirs . 
  also employers have nice indirect ways of screwing you up . 
  imagine situation , real one : boss is comming to you few times a day asking if it something can be finished . 
  you tell him every time it is not manageable . 
  then he says `` sir , you have to manage some extra time for that assigment '' you say that you can come at weekend ... and then it comes to paying , you hear that it was work you had to do anyway because of your slow work ( not true ) so no pay , or that noone was talking about any payment anyway ( because you assumed it would be paid ) or lastly `` noone agreed to your extra hours , this is n't on paper , you showed at weekend out of your free will '' . 
  now people are , but only after years of such shit , leaving them all . 
  most experienced ones see on example of their colleagues that , despite what employer was trying to suggest them , they are worth much , much more on the work market . 
  and get on a black list as `` problematic '' worker ? 
  ok , i was n't clear , i edited my comment . 
  we were mixing . 
  what about jews who were identyfing as poles ? 
  who culturally were poles and only jews by blood ? 
  see ? 
  we can do that all day . 
  any work should be for , at least , minimal wage . 
  what you said is not smart at all . 
  there is a chunk of homeless people who descended into alcoholism * because * they were homeless and also alcoholism does n't make people happy , it is sicknes . 
  it is like selling ipecac for bulimic because * that makes her happy * . 
  and with that attitude their intern work is worth even less . 
  edit : i think i was n't clear ... not attitude of interns , attitude toward inters . 
  low quaility bait , my friend . 
  my fav part of martyr olympics is when we count polish-jews . 
  were they more polish or more jewish ? 
  or both ? 
  or none ? 
  depends who is counting !, 
  anyway i moved to oppression olympics , better dynamic of play i must say . 
  a bank that would use gold standard maybe ? 
  [ si deus nobiscum quis contra nos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_minorities_in_poland#minorities_in_the_kingdom_of_poland_and_the_polish-lithuanian_commonwealth ) brother , it is not only us who we have to remember about . 
  #make _ kresy_great_again !, 
  the minority claiming or forgetting own language ? 
  we did n't claimed lithuania because you forgotten your langaue , we claimed you because we were * in love * with your language , culture ~ ~ and clay ~ ~ . 
  re-confederate plz ? 
  lets put `` comman '' back in our `` wealth '' . 
  call me . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i_love_you, 
  it 's sickening . 
  another case : the temporary employment agency . 
  by law temporar work ca n't be longer than 18/36 months ( it should be then `` normal '' , fulltime work ) . 
  what were our agencies doing ? 
  they were shuffling worker * between * agencies , eploying them for the same employer for years on the conditions of `` temporary '' work . 
  all benefits for the employer , none for employee .
