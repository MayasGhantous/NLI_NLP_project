  we can always be giving them numbers . 
  or randomized codenames . 
  * blue bunny * * pink pinky * * green grob * * lemon lenny * easy to recognize and no glory . 
  then it would be no . 
  ca n't say for u/econ _ orc but i personally blame idiots and anyone who profits from idiots . 
  no washing hands here . 
  with tickles and pink jumpsuits . 
  smart terrorist tend to do more than rushing into temple to slice some throats with knifes . 
  someone joked today about erdogan-putin union ... maybe we should stop giving them ideas ? 
  found it : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ukz6z/why_would_vladimir_putin_want_to_leak_the_dnc/d5qm34k u/executivemonkey i think you are now ottoman advisor ? 
  ah thaaat , i thought you you were using car-beating analogy as a point `` you are using cars , you do n't have to be afraid of assult '' . 
  well , using cars can kill you , yeah , but there is no malice ( mostly ) in car accident . 
  being wrecked in a car and being wrecked by group of people might leave same bruises and same scars , but emotional damage is bigger because fear against humans is bigger than fear of object . 
  it is just how you feel about someone slipping into industrial shredder and someone being pushed into industrial shredder . 
  same outcome , different feelings . 
  i can only guess but police stated , like u/elvishcopter pointed out , it is not extremist attack so i will wait for more info as it can be anything now . 
  i 'm using a car like for 3 years now , for most of my life i was walking and using a bus to get from place to place . 
  you know how to handle beating without a car ? 
  you run . 
  in poland i 'm sure sad-faced-men would knock at your door , knock your door out and carry you out like a plank in the first sight of a problem . 
  social service . 
  broom duty , removing gum from pavement , removing pigeon droppings , washing clothes in prison , scrapping dirt from titles in showers . 
  there are things to do . 
  you swedes are really , really nice people . 
  i will take 15 beatings over 1 `` be killed by terrorist '' thank you very much . 
  beatings i know how to handle . 
  sounds like a case where doctor refuses help , eg . 
  liver transplant for alcoholic patient and patient returns with gun and shots him/her . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ hope, 
  and so we do . 
  but oh maaaan , our chechens are best chechens !, 
   if that 's true they must be dumb as fuck they sliced throat of an innocent man , you ca n't expect much . 
  well . . fuck . 
  they cam , yes , but stigma is there . 
  he would n't be happy tho ' . 
  nah , i do n't criticize you there , i was just answering that guy . 
  i * could * have defend that article myself , as i reposted it , but i allready had my temp ban and i did n't want to get perma one here for arguing with a mod lol . 
  do we still have problem with chechens ? 
  our prisons does n't have `` strong , radicalized muslim minority '' to make him feel comfy , if anything it has `` radicalized polish majority '' . 
  i think he will regret that he did n't just gtfo after sweden and switzerland nicely sayd to him `` go away '' . 
   and i do n't think they consider legal methods only . 
  they gon na feed him pork . 
  [ do n't let your dreams be dreams . 
  i used to laught at that man but after readign his history all i can feel is sadness for him . 
  i do n't know , but everytime some leader or big fish in the west fucks up something really , really bad there is always * someone * to jump out of the bushes and yell `` do n't look at that !, 
  you will make putin happy ! '' . 
  internal tensions in eu , immigration problem , briexit and now this . 
  why this happend , who is responsible ? 
  * it does n't matter * but what * does * is that * you * paying attention to that makes putin happy !, 
  be ignorant !, 
  do n't react !, 
  and they say we poles are russophobes . 
  do not hurt brother in potatoes !, 
  eu is fine , it just has some really stupid ideas from time to time and when someone says we should take them because we take money ( and some even say free money ... ) we get kinda angry . 
  well , * you * need a break , for us poles it is first such thing in loooooong time , someone trying to bring theirs holy war on our turf . 
  i 'm pissed , * we * are pissed . 
  also translation of this topic is iffy and short . 
  it says `` small amounts of explosives , not sufficient to make an explosion '' but what is said in polish media is that he had traceable amounts of explosive on his clothes , 2 types , including c4 . 
  he had to , at some time , handle enought explosives to leave traces on his clothes * and * be detectable by trained dog , as animal was the one who lead policemen from routine check ( were they checking roads that pope is going to use ? ) . 
  also he was renting multiple locations on the route of parade ( or something ) . 
  anyway , polish source is `` not reliable '' while international ones are short and sketchy . 
  it was removed this time because it is local news . 
  look at second comment here . 
  he should n't be here and doing what he was doing in the first place . 
  at saturday i ' v seen many colorful people having fun on occasion of world youth day * without * explosives . 
  i am very , very angry right now . 
  http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/turkish-men-shaving-beards-avoid-labeled-jihadists-article-1.1976176 oh they can change if they want . 
  also `` subhan allah '' in place of `` allahu akbar '' could help . 
  there are options and some are using them . 
  swastika is racist symbol , and it was symbol of hapiness . 
  cross was a symbol of capital punishment device , now it is a symbol of christ ( and for asians it is a symbol of west ) . 
  gay is a word to describe homosexuals , it was used long ago to describe happy people and even before that - promiscuous people . 
  words , symbols , they are changing meaning . 
  there are things that were ok and now are not , knowing this and at the same time ignoring whole society because just because is , truly , ignorant . 
  because why meaning given to a symbol by people from the past means more than meaning given now ? 
  also , there is a context , when you go and dress for historical reenactment of some slavs wearing swastika does n't mean the same as wearing it on your sleeve dor protest . 
  maaaan ... it 's not that hard . 
  i think it is based on human limitations and optimization , because , as you are saying , either we are able to monitor every single individual from given group or you are forbidden from forming your opinion . 
  i ca n't even ... 
  it 's perfect ... 
  no we were n't , but we were in `` special extra care '' . 
  you might be not but can you tell for sure for any other egyptian ? 
  we could make a beat : for every pole that blows himself up i will rip one of my nails off my finger and you will do the same for every egyptian who self-explodes , how about that ? 
  we were the only country where helping a jew was punished by death by germans . 
  it was n't excuse , it was a fact . 
  ah man , you are a lifesaver !, 
  for a moment i did n't know what to do !, 
  i have a great idea !, 
  automated facebook profile changer !, 
  you download an app and admin overlayes your profile picture with right flag depending on location of attack . 
  and it was a bomb . 
  lovely . 
  awkward , is n't it ? 
  my facebook provile picture ca n't handle french * and * german flag at once !, 
  beside all my cinism , i really hoped this would turn out to be a gas explosion . 
  polish politicians do n't even need to try . 
  i do n't know , better `` racist '' than dead ? 
  you tell me . 
  ok , why people put a knife and a pepper spray on the same level ? 
  well , if every single victim was sitting in a truck ... you know the rest .
