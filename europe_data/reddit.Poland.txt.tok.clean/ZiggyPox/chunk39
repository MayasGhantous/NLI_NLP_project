  were germans always that angry at merkel ( and her gov ) or it is recent shift of mood ? 
  i remember talking with germans year or two ago and all criticism was answered with kind of patronising rejoinder `` i hope you poles will someday outgrow your antics and xenophobia * something something * properly join intenrational community '' . 
  it 's going to blow . 
  heh , a nation is complex construct . 
  blood , race , culture , history , religion , customs , language . 
  some nations are strongly based on race and customs ( african countries , poland ) others have little to do with race ( usa ) , some are in transit ( germany , france ) . 
  i would argue more but it seems you see nationalism = `` all things that nazi believed '' and , beside , other points are explained nicely in responses to you from other redditors . 
  exacly that kind of things i had in mind . 
  sans cold war ,, 
  i still see it as a great tool , the fact that islam , or part of it , is problematic it does n't mean that tool is bad . 
  because lets be honest , no mater what system you construct , * that * part of islam will be always unhappy unless it is 100 % exacly as they want . 
   european medieval society would not fully fit inside western civilisation . 
  witch hunts , views on gays and non-believers are at direct conflict with modern western society . 
  adopting western values is n't mandatory . 
  that 's why we would keep them far away in their land of crusades and live happy away of each other . 
  that 's why i 'm thinking we should use these human traits in form of patriotism ( if nationalism is too dirtied world for people ) . 
  we should n't fight against human nature , we should use it , redirect it for good things . 
  just like we redirected need for fighting against eachother into healthly competition we also can redirect our basic need of tribalism . 
  that 's how immigrants should be thinking . 
  say hi to that random dude from me . 
  enjoy your beer and cheers !, 
   kavod hamet , showing proper respect to the dead , has always been a deeply-rooted tradition within the jewish people . 
  in halacha , this concept finds its expression in laws against autopsy ; 2 in the requirement of a speedy burial ; 3 http://www.jlaw.com/articles/heritage.html that being said , jews do move their graves so i do n't understand opposition from religious groups . 
  as far as i remember there is some religious stigma and taboo in jewish religion concerning removing dead body from the ground . 
  that is not part of our tradition . 
  if so germany managed to produce * first * right wing extremist * and * terrorist in tecent time . 
  welp , good luck . 
  by this logic , big chunk of jewery ran away to us before the war so ... oh my ... 
  i would write conclusion down but it is illegal to do so xd, 
  interesting thing : https://www.journeyman.tv/film/2801  * they were herded into barn which was doused with petrol and set on fire . 
  * petrol ... on rural area where everyone were still using horses to plough fields they found enought petrol lying around to set that barn on fire . 
  there was significant help and without it there would n't be jedwabne but oh well , we did it , yes . 
  about kielce pogrom , from wiki :  the kielce pogrom was an outbreak of violence against the jewish community centre 's gathering of refugees in the city of kielce , poland on 4 july 1946 by the polish communist armed forces ( lwp , kbw ) and plain-clothed agents in the presence of a crowd of onlookers , which resulted in the killing of 42 jews . 
  polish communist courts later tried and condemned nine people to death in connection with the incident . 
  i would like to say that this was done by communists , as [ kbw were nothing but trash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internal_security_corps ) but they were our communists . 
  in interwar period no nation was saint ; ), 
  do n't be envious . 
   so you think that was an act of ethnic cleansing , not genocide ? 
  because ethnic cleansing and genocide are a bit different things . 
  no , because if i thought so i would n't quote * the united nations genocide convention * definition of genocite that , conveniently has part * `` destroy , in whole or in part '' * while in your quote there is part in opposition to that idea : * '' no evidence that upa intended to annihilate entire or significant part of the polish nation '' *, 
  that was ethnic cleasing . 
   `` the united nations genocide convention defines it as `` acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group '' it does n't mean anything that they did n't want to kill all poles in the world . 
  oh come on . 
  we survived 6 years of germans , we will survive few more of pis . 
  every pole was commie after the war , noone asked the if they wanted or not : ), 
  https://wykoprecords.bandcamp.com/album/polish-poverty ... this one ? 
  would ask my grandfather as he was send to kill your * independence fighters * but too bad he is long dead . 
  what i do know is that he was in then polish people 's army , so add communists to nazi collaborators . 
  his wife could have been working , he could have taken last-minute trip , or have a family somewhere near . 
  there are options . 
  i was in germany while being jobless . - . 
  i 'm talking about remaining 2/3 of muslims who identify as french and who shit at murderers . 
  these ones are part of the west . 
   polish people do n't have a honour or pride now i 'm fcuking rustled , brother . 
  once goose assulted my sister when she was 11 . 
  i love animals but man , that * thing * . 
  wacked it throught its head and it went like a ball on a string for the moment . 
  religion is hell of a drug . 
  example : jerusalem syndrome . 
  leniency brings absolutely nothing good ... 
  i 've been reading germans opinion on this topic and it goes over my head . 
  people are telling you that you are going to die in terror attacks and you are like * `` well , all men has to die anyway '' * . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  our people are our wall . 
  read it as you want . 
  let 's just say that these attacks are against western values , secular muslims celebrating national french holidays are being part of the west . 
  i love your username . 
  i am rather prejudiced person but the [ backlash is real . 
  ] ( http://video.news.com.au/v/478242/france-my-country-is-france-woman-reacts-when-told-go-back-to-own-country-july-18 ) also , as they say , one third of the victims were probably muslims . 
  [ but on the other hand a narrative that muslims are the main victim of attack anyway and always ] ( http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/over-one-third-of-nice-attack-victims-were-muslim-20160719-0034.html ) is rather sickening . 
  it is on par with such nonsense as `` women have always been the primary victims of war '' . 
  yes , muslim communities suffers from these attack too but saying they are * the main victims * induces heavy facepalm . 
  after war my granddad was running with gun shooting at ukrainian insurgent army soldiers . 
  there is no need for turning that hate into tradition . 
  you know , turning germany into homogenous society tomorrow ( or any time in the future ) would require some horrible inhuman actions and that is big no-no so that 's the difference between turning something into something and having something . 
  for germany a * serious * option would be , for example , working against ghettoization of your minorities . 
  hmm ... 
  i think there is some polish-lithuanian minority in dire need of our ~ ~ tanks ~ ~ help !, 
  dunno , having homogenous society works for us , i think you would figure something out for yourself . 
  you mean , western salary in western country or western salary in poland ? 
   thermic under shirts that 's not comfortable . 
  imagine going in and out of buildings , ones heated , other ones not so much , also dress code to work . 
  it is do-able but wearing layered clothes is easier . 
  oh come on , we have ... errr ... brutalism ? 
  i do n't know maaaan , lets just form commonwealth and have good time , mkay ? 
  soo , what are you doing ? 
  or want to do ? 
  had to pay nothing :d, 
   clothes in vast variety of black and brown my fav colours !, 
  in poland businessmen have still tendency to undercut peoples salary . 
  winter clothes are n't cheap and shoes , for example , are taking good beating during winter . 
  winter breaks cars , causes significant damage to the buildings and/or piping and to mitigate these damages you need to put extra penny into adaptation . 
  not until they were not-so-secret anymore . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human-baiting n-n-n-nope, 
  heh , i know that pain . 
   poland 's nobility were also more numerous than those of all other european countries , constituting some 10 -- 12 % [ 28 ] of the total population of historic polish -- lithuanian commonwealth also some 10 -- 12 % among ethnic poles on ethnic polish lands ( part of commonwealth ) , but up to 25 % of all poles worldwide but out nobility prefered to drink and kill each other tee hee . 
  sorry , you still are wrong , people can * pretend they do n't care * to a point and after that point you get riots and bunch of angry white people . 
  people can be `` getting used to '' if there is no other option , yes , but for germany there is : turning right . 
  that 's terrible , yes , but i 'm afraid that if nothing is going to change it will be inevitable . 
  not any that we are aware of .
