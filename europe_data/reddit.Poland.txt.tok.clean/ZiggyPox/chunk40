  we are deeply sorry and i beg for your forgiveness , fellow redditors . 
  it just ... happend . 
  law and stuff . 
  i 'm so sorry : (, 
  false , it is n't burning . 
  well ... 
  i just went throught the list of other blood sports on wiki . 
  * badger tossing * cock throwing * octopus wrestling * human-baiting we are damn creative . 
  it sounds like brits had tad too much free time to kill . 
  what about 80 percent lower receivers ? 
  oh yes , they have a huge hard on . 
  too bad they have also a huge letdown : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome  * as of 2004 the japanese embassy runs a 24-hour help line to assist japanese tourists suffering from this condition . 
  * i find it sad but fascinating . 
  har har , end is nigh !, 
  is police corrupt ? 
  in traffic police maybe . 
  real gangs were broken into pieces , now we have true western white collar organised crime . 
  i 'm uploading this message 3rd time lol . 
  this is called `` paradox of tolerance '' , wikipedia has nice short entry on the topic . 
  when i hear people arguing like you do [ all i can see is this snipped from `` brazil '' . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kfnhxibec ), 
  ok , mr common sense , thing about terrorism : when it happens you ca n't do anything yes , because you , or your country , failed to do what you had to long before that event . 
  it is logic of driving without your seatbelt buckled because `` oh , i wo n't be able to do anything anyway when i pancake on a brick wall '' . 
  but i 'm happy you are happy : ), 
  used to ? 
  yes . 
  happy about ? 
  nope . 
  people can eat shit but let 's not make it a staple food . 
  few of them ar like 2 years old . 
  oy , there are many answers and few are from ukrainians ( at least one ) , you have chosen * that one snipped * . 
  it tells more about you than about that link overall . 
  you are welcome : ), 
  you too ? 
  oh boy , i ca n't wait for our transcendence into nuclear realm !, 
  praise the atom !, 
  https://www.quora.com/what-are-the-differences-between-ukrainian-people-and-russians let them be . 
  on the one hand , it does suck but on the other hand i 'm rolling in * almost * brand new volkswagen so i call it a win . 
  those nasty poles with german sounding surnames , damn heydrich und frank !, 
  i do n't thing it goes well with `` beat , post on facebook , go scott free '' claim but it is a good source outlining problems of lgb people in russia , so thanks anyway . 
   the only thing that can stop a ~ ~ bad ~ ~ guy with an axe is ~ ~ a good ~ ~ * our * guy with an axe !, 
  here , fixed it for you , 
  i 'm not saying you are wrong but i 'm lookin at this from the other angle ... people , as a mass , are n't that smart as we and they would wish to be . 
  lack of time , lack of capabilities , whatever . 
  the thing is you have to work with what you got and hating people wo n't help . 
  also i do n't like when people tend to say that other people are not thinking for themselfes . 
  people do , but with given set of data and given time ( and taking into account that we are n't much different from each other ) people tend to come to similar conclusions . 
  on top of that infoxication is a real issue . 
  you have 8 hour work , 2 hour commune , 8 hour sleep and then you have to fit in remaining 6 hours everything else , including shuffling throught all data and news , fresh and old , true and false , to verify and update your world view . 
  ( inderting random rant ) oh , all that while being active and innovative , that 's what market needs !, 
  there was that saying that if you feel surrounded by the crowd of idiots look at yourself to make sure you are not part of it yourself . 
  people tends to find other people stupid because they usually judge them on a field they are good at , but others are not . 
  also when you check * public * opinion , or the way it is measured , it is short question and on specific topic , based mostly on emotions . 
  people are asked `` man killed a woman , what do you thing '' and everyone is outraged , noone asks if she wanted to stab him in the eye with a screwdriver or whatever . 
  but still , you do n't wa n't like , 38 million people to get angry at once at you , that 's why you ca n't just say public opinion is shit . 
  also i blame steady degeneration of press quaility and scored-by-clicks-and-outrage-determinant for disinformation of people . 
  yeah , that was bad joke . 
  let 's not cross that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ maginot line . 
  also , nice username . 
  well played sir . 
  i would like a source on such claim . 
  so , how effective is that as a method of suicide ? 
  a chief or a guide would fit ... how do you spell that in german ? 
  i think i just found gorszy sort . 
  go back to your kod pogo party . 
  you absolutely did not make sense here right now bu i will try to guess what you tried to say . 
  you know why politicians are detached ? 
  because they live in ivory towers above their own people . 
  lets say you want to force young people into gov , who will you chose ? 
  noone , a choice will be made by old people who have allready filled lower level of their party with young people , `` interns '' and `` volunteers '' . 
  there are young people in politics , groomed and trained to think and govern just like old people do . 
  racism , whose racism ? 
  you are welcome . 
  ah yes , there were these too . 
  to be honest i never believed that politicians to be stupid . 
  i believe them to be detached and corrupt and both things are n't age related . 
  why does n't young people run the government ? 
  ah yeah , they do n't know how . 
  you see , there is magical line , when you are smart enought to manage anything you are too old to be called young . 
  there was one polish book , `` ch\u0142opi '' ( `` peasants '' ) , where different families were portrayed and in one of them grandfather was kept under stairs , given only half of food because he ca n't work anymore so why wo n't he die allready . 
  that 's ageism . 
  `` old people are bad and stupid mkay '' . 
  thanks for your ... opinion . 
  you must be joking . 
  it 's axes , axes are making people hurt other people . 
  we need stronger axe control laws to stop this madness . 
  huh ... 
  i do n't know , but i like them . 
   when your boss tells you to do something ... you do it . 
  if it is against the law , i do n't . 
  i call it a healthly and stable relationship , a solid family . 
  what model do you think is better ? 
  is there also a bank full of women willing to be lonely mothers ? 
  well , it is surprising how things can change in 2 hours .

  what privilige ? 
  [ `` women have always been the primary victims of war . 
  '' ] ( http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-victims-of-war/ ), 
  well , i was being sarcastic but lets take it seriously for a moment . 
  in western world relationships are mostly , or encouraged to be , monogamous .
