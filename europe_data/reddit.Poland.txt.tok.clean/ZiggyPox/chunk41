  if you would end with , lets say , 1:2 proportions of man to woman you ca n't really expect every man to have an affair , or every second woman to be lone mother . 
  woman wo n't pop out a kid without a man and while we live in culture one-man-for-one-woman your reasoning kinda loses its sense . 
  there is never enough investment in eastern poland . . never enoug\u0338ht . 
  n\u0321\u0358\u035fe\u0358\u0335v\u0338er\u0322\u0358 \u0338\u0340\u0321e\u0321 n\u0337o\u0338\u0341ug\u035f\u034fh\u0321\u0361t\u0327\u0322.\u035f\u0358, 
  in my city , and many other cities , problematic people tend to live in old houses around old town part of the city and rest is rather evenly spread in panelak communities ( varies from city to city ) . 
  in city of thorn they relocated many problematic people from around old town to the outskirts to the little bit more modern flats , right between police station and gated community ( also social flats but different kind ) . 
  few individuals won `` you go to jail '' prize and now everything is just fine . 
  well , we are all white like a fresh snow so this might be that . 
  indeed we are . 
  need help , send money for ~ ~ army ~ ~ cultural events and education . 
  yes it is . 
   being hostage of an ideology that deeply indoctrinates you next time someone says that poland is racist and prejudiced , that we attack gay , we are papal state and that we burn jews ... hey , i 'm just a victim !, 
  hey hey maaan , it looks like you need your daily dose of feminism doubled !, 
  women are not a breeding machine , period !, 
  oh but men can die , sure . 
  or they are waiting for biggest smokescreen in history of politics . 
  some nuclear accident in france ? 
  enviromental disaster in baltic sea ? 
  who knows but they will stall it as long as they can . 
  they are just going to find convinient scapegoat , that 's all . 
  pm resigned to buy time and now i 'm sure they are thinking who and how to exploit ( for right money ) who will take the next punch to the belly . 
  hey man , i 'm on your side here . 
  all i said that after 200 years you deserve some rights and thus you can make some claims . 
  on the other hand if you are sharing some crack ... 
  i do n't know , maybe ? 
  i do n't know , having affordable housing is nice . 
   4 ) the complete distruction of all soviet style housing in every area of france . 
  the construction of new , more smaller housing spread around france . 
  wait , what ? 
  do you mean panelak buildings ? 
  these are awsome !, 
  hands off !, 
  i love living in these !, 
  cheap , comfy , thick solid walls , dry . 
  i did n't say you did , it 's just goodwin 's law was usually pointed in the topics * fara away from extremists * , like * `` you eat scrambled eggs with ketchup ? 
  what are you ? 
  a nazi ? 
  that `` cunt '' at the end was lovely and well placed . 
  after 200 years ? 
  you 've got to have some claims . 
  by un forced replacement of natives is also genocide but oh well . 
  to be fair , there are some groups of jews and chritians that should just stfu because they are not much better . 
  heh , so what ? 
  goodwin 's law is pseudo/joke law . 
  if clone of adolf hitler would be jollygaging on the street you would n't be able to talk about it without stroking goodwin 's law . 
  and here we have , fringe group with ideology that forces their conquer , supremacy and genocide of enemy including his/her children and dog . 
  how more hitler can you get ? 
  ** [ hey there my friend !, 
  have a song and dance along !, 
  hint : it is written in blood on the bodies of dead . 
  i 'm sure he was right-wing extremist or just mentally ill with acces to machinegun . 
   by being horizontal . 
  that 's the plan \u261e \uff9f \u2200 \uff9f ) \u261e but i need more room for my activities t_t, 
  and if you wo n't yeld to `` innovation '' you are hitler/nazi :  hungary uber alles we all know from where this pun comes . 
  not as much as i would wish , hehe . 
  but it is not that . 
  these things are shorter , there are breeded that way . 
  my uncle is a farmer and he told me :p also i have source :  plant breeders changed wheat in dramatic ways . 
  once more than four feet tall , modern wheat -- the type grown in 99 percent of wheat fields around the world -- is now a stocky two-foot-tall plant http://www.rodalewellness.com/food/wheat-free-diet i think scietific one would be better but oh well . 
  but anyway , to my point , how am i supposed to hide with my * significant other * in 2 foot tall wheat field ?? 
  also protip , do n't hide in field during harvest time ... 
  ah , yeah , well , that is other thing . 
  i do n't know , but i 'm not sure if they will leave eu , they do n't have to , i think they are checking their options now . 
  still , they do n't have to make sure eu citizens are all cozzy and happy , it would be nice but it is n't mandatory . 
  they only have to allow them to live , work and have all benefits , what they do . 
  and to make something clear , there are few people in the uk that i hope will never , ever leave uk and stay there till they kick the bucket so briexit is n't my dream . 
  little bit off-topic but do you remember when fields used to have these loooong stalks where you could even hide in ? 
  now all of these fields have short stalked cereal , killing all the fun ... 
  i said in the decision of enforcing brexit . 
  whole idea of brexis is that `` do we continue to go for eu regulations or against them '' so there was no point in pointing out that , as long uk is in eu , it has to threat people as an eu state . 
  or are you saying that by fact of them being in eu they ca n't even discuss leaving eu , because it would be bad for non-british citizens ? 
  and nothing that i said was against that . 
  what brit gov decides should be based on what would be best for brits . 
   are you ok with polish citizens living in limbo in the uk ? 
  and  so you do n't believe in eu free movement from which poland has benefitted ? 
  these questions . 
  anyway , polish in britain are either polish or british or both . 
  it is based on personal identity , ethnicity and legal status . 
  so what was that question about believe in freedom of movement ? 
  and when uk leaves eu it is no more eu member state , correct ? 
  what 's the argument here ? 
  also solidarity wanted more money as a labor union , revolution was n't their plan , shit hit the fan it all started crumbling down , old communists used this occasion to run from russia and implant themselfes in the business world of capitalism , using their prl gained influence for today . 
  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wojna_na_g%c3%b3rze  war at the top - the popular name of the conflict , which broke out in 1990 between lech walesa , chairman of the independent self-governing trade union `` solidarity '' , and the government t. mazowiecki . 
  ------------------------------------------  the war on top of it was a result of focusing on solidarity internal conflict between left-wing solidarity and its main ideologue adam michnik and right with jaroslaw kaczynski at the helm . 
  between the warring parties was the leader of solidarity , lech walesa . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lech_wa%c5%82%c4%99sa#kiszczak_archives please , tell me little bit more about solidarity . 
  so everyone can be screaming around them `` get out '' and that is it . 
  they have no power . 
  it is hilarious . 
  yes , if they are going to stop being in eu then there ca n't be * eu free movement of people * any more . 
  also free movement of people is a deal , it is no matter of `` believe '' . 
  who said so ? 
  they are still in ue and , for now , noone kicked poles out . 
  it is like a hiv virus , uses trick to go throught osmotic barier of our attention . 
  we are doing everything to remove humans from the system that is based on humans . 
  we are sooo smart . 
  biedronka loves , biedronka feeds , all hail biedronka !, 
  they are poles who at the moment are british citizens . 
  i love my nationals but britain is british and brits should come first . 
  there is bunch of poles with full citizenship and we do n't have to worry about them .
