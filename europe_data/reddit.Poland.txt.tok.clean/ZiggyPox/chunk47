  not that much of resources but manpower rather . 
  we were producing goods that were exported and exported , machines , vehicles , parts and while we were making lots of them there was never ending shortage of these things here in poland . 
  i do blame german state for trying to spin everything around like they are humanist empire of the world now , also i do n't consider eu funds to be in any form money paid for what happend in wwii , these are money we are offered in deal that , without that money , would criple our economy so hard . 
  when germans try to spin it that way i am pissed not only at gov. 
  ( because i 'm mostly talking about govs here ) but at an individual on personal level . 
  i think we have our few polish heroes that other nations would be salty about but i think somehow we can work over these problems , with ukrainians too as their gov. 
  seems to try do better ( while it is n't turning on its heel and back to us again , that is ) . 
  yet again , i do n't trust russian federation as a state ( taking into account people in power now were in power * then * ) but i do n't mind its citizens . 
  i think , on personal level , i would make good friends even with such a smart person as you . 
  when that time comes we shall breed our own devils . 
  you mean sans turning us into puppet state and draining our resources for over 45 years ? 
  you have next 20 years to go it seems so we can * forget * . 
  you say that russian federation did nothing wrong for whole whooping 25 years oh wow and we should be best buddies because of that and then you go with upa that is n't active for how long ? 
  and that same upa is a reason that our support for ukraine is questionable ? 
  and my grandfather was fighting against upa mind that . 
  i do n't know , world wise , who is our friend . 
  but i know who is not . 
  and it is n't only russian federation . 
  for us nothing even good come from russia , even that oil in its nature is poisonous . 
  i do n't love nato but i need nato . 
  history and all that . 
   per capita income here 's the catch . 
  that 's why i said , countries become wealthier , people become poorer . 
  there is group that gets richer but overall . 
  people become poorer . 
  also we were in soviet block , if you have nothing and add to it something gain is incredible . 
  negotiators would sell out both canada and europe to big busines , influenced by `` lobbyist '' and `` advisors '' helping them create strangely convenient laws . 
  and it would go further the way it is going for some time : countries are getting richer , but somehow people are getting poorer . 
  personal gain . 
  yep , first , go cry to uncle sam about that , second , uncle sam wo n't bomb me , dunno about the federation . 
  tell me that after green men `` liberate polish minority '' at kaliningrad oblast . 
  they are liars , we ca n't trust them at any level , we ca n't be partners , nato trainings are justified , there is no guarantee that russian government wants peace . 
  so situation is so-so . 
  to be honest i would like to see source of that too : ) . 
  what i wanted to say is that even if they would n't let that fly on the air , they ai n't no good at all . 
  hey op , is foreign ministry ** ( msz ) ** lying ? 
  http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/7,114881,20255677,nie-dla-dekryminalizacji-homoseksualizmu-polska-w-onz-ramie.html#boxnewslink  `` poland took an active part in the work on a political statement in the fight against hiv aids . 
  polish position during the negotiations was included in a joint eu position . 
  poland at the un did not exist in the national character ( individually ) in the present declaration '' - said in a statement the foreign ministry ** ( msz ) ** press office . 
  just asking , i 'm gettin ' conflicting signals here . 
  you know , it would be * horrible * if you would , by accident , make us look like some primitive medieval inquisition-esque homophobes . 
  a really , really unfortunate thing . 
  try it .

  polish position during the negotiations was included in a joint eu position . 
  poland at the un did not exist in the national character ( individually ) in the present declaration '' - said in a statement the foreign ministry press office . 
  oryginal article does n't have well estabilished source ( like , proof ) so it gets strange . 
  is msz lying ? 
  did horrible pis allready purged it and replaced with its own people ? 
  i 'm going to ask op . 
  radio maryja is mostly consumed my old people left alone to themselfes that are afraid of dying , i only know few ( umm . . 
  i think 2 ) young people that find it good . 
  there does fly some ridiculous shit from time to time and i do think it is damaging . 
  remember these old people ? 
  i know one who listens to radio maryja , she also watches fake overdramatised dramas with cheap actors where main story is like `` my father sleeps with my best friend that is also a drug dealer '' ( i think these are called paradocumentals ) . 
  http://www.ipla.tv/serial/5001641-paradokumentalny/5002407-szkola-zycia this is total crap ... and she believes in it , she is sure this is how degenerated are young people . 
  this thing makes porridge out of your brain . 
  back to the topic : radio maryja is n't good at all , believe me . 
  nobody cares here , we are the baddies now . 
  but seriously i dunno why we backed russia there . 
  i want names of people behind that . 
  i said come in , do n't stand there !, 
  i said come in , do n't stand there !, 
  i said come in , do n't stand there !, 
  and i 'm still disappointed that german people are telling us what we should and should n't do . 
  well , they did n't find koran at his house . 
  if they would far right subs would be all over it . 
  i met a girl that was born without an arm and she was n't unhappy about it . 
  when you are `` born '' some way , or it was like that all the time that you can remember . 
  but she did wish she had both arms , she just was n't * sad * . 
  well , nato is * big * but dunno how well organised it is . 
  when all nato troops are in bits and pieces everywhere russian power forming well-oiled wedge can go throught country in blitzkrieg style . 
  thus we need training in cooperation . 
  wow , just like weather forecast !, 
  and i think it was fun . 
  you used him as a example . 
  if you would use one islamist as an example why we would fight against islam , pointing islam true problems , you would be prejudiced/racist . 
  i just wanted to point out that if people really believe they have good reason to hate group of people , boy , they * do * hate group of people . 
  do not assign opinion and actions of one person to whole group . 
  did britain first claimed this attack like isis does ? 
  you would n't say that attack of one islamic fanatic screaming `` allah akbar '' is representing islam , as not every terrorist attack was connected to isis . 
  http://www.daruliftaa.com/node/5852 http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/misinterpreted_verses/authority_ ( p1246 ) . html depends how you want to interpretate . 
  please do not associate actions of an individual with beliefs and ideas of wider group of people as the means to discriminate against that group . 
  thank you . 
  my father , when he was soldier , was trained in variety of misions , one of them being how to `` neutralise '' nuclear landmines . 
  going back home was n't always an option in these plans lol ... and it was also after 89 ' !, 
  soo , welcome back good times ? 
  good thing your country is practically a slope . 
  hydropower and all that . 
  by train or by air drop ? 
  it is hygienic and easy to manage . 
  if you are part-time worker trying to make as much as you can before coming back to poland , living at meager accommodation ... well , it helps . 
  or white-power , i wo n't vouch for every single pole . 
  as i said somewhere else , there are only whites here . 
  when police is profiling they do n't take consider you a suspect * only * because you are black , it is * also * because you are black . 
  as someone pointed , you have these gents : http://fabmagazineonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/fab-magazine-well-dressed-black-man-750x400.jpg you have this guy : http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538a625fe4b02d6eaed1745c/t/53c2a3f8e4b081390c4ad389/1405264896869/ and you have that group : http://i.skyrock.net/7647/27407647/pics/840172283_small.jpg to be honest , i would be making questions toward that third group , no matter if they were white or black . 
  this is n't usa , noone is going to shoot them . 
  never felt like i was being harassed . 
  i answered questions , many times cops did n't mind me carrying box-cutters and chiesels in my bag hehehe . 
  sure , there were more questions but i was fine with that .
