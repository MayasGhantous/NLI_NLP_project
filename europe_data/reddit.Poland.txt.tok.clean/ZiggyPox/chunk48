  after all i expect them to stop and check people randomly carrying edgy toys because i know not everyone is as nice as i am . 
  just to butt in with valid sources pointing differences : http://news.sky.com/story/1633328/scots-police-teach-us-cops-how-to-avoid-gun-use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8qa5wk_f7u being profiled and in case of problem shoot till dead or being profiled and in case of problem manhandled . 
  profiling is n't bad , how you handle it changes everything . 
  do n't wear hood all the time , do n't point and scream at cops and when you go to gym , you go to gym , you take bag , towel and soft drink . 
  just like in poland , you would say it is wrong to suspect everyone carrying baseball bat . 
  it * would * be * kinda * wrong if not for the fact that for every 100 bats sold there is maybe one ball hehehe . 
  who the hell owns phonebooks these days ? 
  anyway , i 'm living in poland , there is no colorful minority to shift focus on and * i * was looking like a hardcore junkie ( bad diet and 5 hours of sleep for months will do that to you haha ) . 
  never got bashed with a book , stick , never got maced . 
  also i never got into a squabble with an officer for being questioned . 
  on the other hand my friends who also were n't junkies were surprised that policemen were giving them hard time . 
  stopping calling them whores and dogs and pigs should help little bit , i think . 
  well , monty python group is/was always intellectually at lest little bit above your common celebritie , they were quite focused on social commentary in their work ( mixed with crude humor ofc ) . 
  i could go on but yeah , little bit more than joe the butcher . 
  irish have allready been living with poles immigrants for some time , did n't they ? 
  they should feel at home here hehehe . 
  do what you can do . 
  i stopped wearing the hood and everything is good . 
  there are more things than skin colour to make police question you from time to time . 
  with banksters menance ? 
  oh god no ... 
  nazis ruined many beautiful things , symbols , sayings , ideas , lives ... 
  that is ... awkward , all that . 
  he was kid then , yes , you can nderstand him . 
  but you ca n't understand him hat he is saying today about that experience . 
  you , i , and everyone here knows where investors will go . 
  #invest in eastern poland !, 
  well , that was loaded question , out of blue , out of topic , was n't it ? 
  i ca n't even ... 
  night ? 
  oh grandpa , you silly , you can have * fun whole day * and you can share alcohol too !, 
  it is quite unfair to stay sober while other party is drinking , is n't it ? 
  also i said 3 bottles can give you blowjob , in your idea it was to force one girl to drink , in my experience it was to start a party with 3 + people and have fun times . 
  also , weak wine is like strong beer and * these * go easily * poof * . 
  man , you really * did n't * have a good party in your life ? 
  3 bottles can give you blowjob , it is true , there is no shame in it no matter what * you * might think how someone can do that . 
  you can also use these * one * bottle to blunt trauma someone into submission , should i give dirty look to anyone leaving a shop with a bottle ? 
  ugh , if it is * your * experience i suggest you stop dating girls and start dating women , do n't try to drink 3 bottles at once and stop confusing blowjob with facefuck . 
  man , you sound like you never had a good party ... or tv series marathon . 
  i just checked prices here and it is quite affordable ... why the hell am i looking into that ? 
  it is like 77 polish zlotys for sex ? 
  damn , that is cheap like ... really cheap . 
  if i would pay so much for gas i dunno , i think i would run my whole house on int . 
  engine-generator . 
  sooo 3 bottles of wine = one blowjob ? 
  let me think ... yeah , from my experience that seems just right ... 
  you know , they look like there was solid idea behind that design , it ould just use some tweaks here and there and it would be awwww right . 
  the point othat tower was to show new technology on world fair , it was meant to be stipped down after world fair . 
  she barely could hold that plate with one hand . 
  this man just helped her . 
  how lovely . 
  if you would let them stay where they were , and then put there relocated poles from the east ( from lands taken from poland by zsrr ) you would end with quite lot of pogroms . 
  from the rest of poland it was only wise to remove them , from the lands that happend to be on the side of poland after `` winners '' have redraw borders , welp , that 's tragedy . 
  but still , nothing more than consequences . 
  you do not start genocidal war and you do n't let communists draw the maps . 
  we poles had a good reason to hate germans at that time , as a nation and many on a personal level . 
  forced labour , confiscation of goods and land , everyday humiliation , there were many things for what common pole could hate common german , beside war , death and destruction . 
  happy to hear that !, 
   is there some criteria for calling death of hundreds thousands germans is simply okay ? 
  yes , it is called * consequences * . 
  i invite you to poland , visit our castles , our mountains , thorn , masurian lake district . 
  i would go with chinese . 
  or korean . 
  korea is awsome . 
   or belief , if i say that `` all mgtow should be wooped into sense '' is ti hate speech ? 
  what if i say that about communists ? 
  what about nazi ? 
  that 's how elections work buddy . 
  there is quite difference in numbers , tho . 
  in this case , yes . 
  and then people ask again and again , why poland is so against german politics . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/2200026/eu-constitution-author-says-referendums-can-be-ignored.html kek, 
  hurray !, 
   we all genocided someone at some point nu-uh, 
  it is suffocating for me , and too much of a rat race . 
  god , i hate that city . 
  i use a facebook as part of my work to talk with the clients every day . 
  i ca n't afford to * not * use facebook . 
  it is like hot water and cellphones these days with exception that there ca n't be `` next '' hot water , but there can be next facebookm telling the truth . 
  real estate developers would be drolling all over this photo these days . 
  [ warsaw ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/warsaw_ghetto_destroyed_by_germans,_1945.jpg ) can we stop now ? 
  but mark is right , age of privacy is over , you have to buy piece of it for yourself . 
  just like mark did . 
  is n't it wonderful ? 
  whole new market to ~ ~ abuse ~ ~ ~ ~ exploit ~ ~ develop !, 
  would you be interested in our monthly privacy plan ? 
  well , pola\u0144ski is quite a character and after what happend to him you still ca n't justify what he did * but * you could expect of him to have few screws loose . 
  lovespeech for ** unsmart ** . 
  do not commit toughtcrime with your ungood vocabulary . 
  i do not mock it , it is nice idea . 
  what i mock is human nature and army of trash in black suit waiting to use that bright idea to turn it against us . 
   we ran out of food for the entire world that is dumb way of looking at things . 
  it is like saying that european sewer systems are absolutely wasteful because there is not enought water for everyone on the earth . 
  intermarium is always an option so he can cut us away . 
  hell , i can even pretend to be russian !, 
  why not ? 
  prices will rise to suck out that basic income from people and i can bet it will be on the stuff that you have to pay for . 
  insurance , rent , petrol , food . 
  here it will be 1 $ , there it will be 10 $ , luxury goods will have the biggest kick to keep them luxury . 
  everyone will want that slice of your bc .
