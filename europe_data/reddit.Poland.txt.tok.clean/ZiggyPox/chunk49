  you can try , i welcome change , but i can bet my first bc check that nothing will change in practice . 
  where there is a genius , there is committee of vultures ready to feast . 
  wildfires are also natural , floods also . 
  the thing is , in our natore is to manage stuff . 
  i will call them * unaccompanied minors * and be done with it . 
  i 'm tired with all these euphemisms , i will stick to one i like the most . 
  you might not know , but i have god-given power to trigger ( real ) far right and far left soooo much . 
  i 'm always fun at parties !, 
  http://www.radiolausitz.de/nachrichten/lokalnachrichten/blutige-attacke-vor-dem-city-center-in-goerlitz-1225173/ i do n't know what to say to you . 
  edit : http://www.hitradio-rtl.de/rtl-aktuell/lokal/blutige-attacke-vor-dem-city-center-in-goerlitz-1225173/ have you even tried ? 
  my german is shit but i did manage somehow ... 
  you see , on the wiki he would be written ukrainian-american if he would just moved from ukraine to us . 
  but if you move from us to anywhere , you are always american . 
  your polish might be funny , but your english is awsome so that 's going for you . 
  always look at the bright side of life , [ keep calm and eat p\u0105czki .

  you used something akin to nihilism to negate danger of terrorism . 
  that sarcasm was n't pointless . 
  this is my answer toward your nihilism : we , humans , including me , will make such fucking show out of our lives that very fabric of vast , dead and unfeeling universe will be sad after we are gone into eternal darkness . 
  and i wo n't let some motherfuckers to rain at my party . 
  it 's the air . 
  you see , it is cleaner there , makes you sprout like a young sapling . 
  yes , it is strange and i know why it is so ... * something something auto censorship *, 
  quick , i need a plane ticket straight to brussels , european commission needs to hear about that !, 
  yes , it is my arbitrary opinion based on nothing . 
  `` hey , you are free to choose what you want !, 
  uh , but remember , choice ** x ** comes with rectal examination , just sayin ' ! '', 
  i think we should isolate jean-claude juncker , because he is far-left and populist , says i. 
   \u00a8 how can merkel still be popular in germany when everyone on reddit despises her ? \u00a8 \u00a8 why doesnt everyone care about immigration as much as reddit does ? \u00a8 to be honest , she loses support in real-life just like people * here * care much about immigration : (, 
  not really , i think . 
  there was overall dissatisfaction with po , this case here is only one . 
  there just were n't benevolent wikinauts to write down nice article for you . 
   condescending tone so i should n't even answer you in the first place , eh ? 
  do n't worry , we will endure . 
  public media , i do n't mind , i think i like them more now . 
  cc will manage , pis got little bit over their heads but some cold shower ought to help them . 
  if not they are going to pay , firstly by losing support and by being in the middle of europe they ca n't even blackmail people in staying in . 
   basic working mechanisms of your democracy . 
  lol , installed by communists for communists . 
  yeah , sure . 
  whole polish * postkommunistische systemtransformation * was a farse , nothing more than money grab . 
  we need that shock , so the cockroaches will start running out of the cracks . 
  po also did fiddle with cc , it did n't turned out so bad but still . 
  also , pis is n't `` my people '' . 
  that is kinda awkward now : (, 
  you started talking about how hitler get into power in not-so-direct way , i just played along . 
  and i like how you ignored my question . 
  seruously , * you * would n't ~ ~ mean ~ ~ mind if * your * party was in power out of balance , then it would be * progress * . 
  yeah , i know , and when i 'm talking about h and blitz i mean hitler so it is obvious i got your not so subtle hints ... 
  seriously , if you want to go into reductio ad h you have also to remember why h got into power : because of feeling of servitude . 
  beside , we must have produced some shitty h as he ( they ) did n't manage to start war for over 25 years , where h managed to do that in * blitz * speed ( kek ) . 
  lastly ... there is noone to start a war with : (, 
  every 4-8 years in the time of election here , to be honest . 
  we had pis government once and no nukes went off . 
  what basic freedoms ? 
  edit : no , seriously , name some . 
  i hope you wo n't name that citizens initiative about abortion laws , because this was n't project started by our government . 
  i do n't want you to sound silly . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines sooo it kinda applies ? 
  our new party sucks balls but our old one was ever worse . 
  i can endure some mismanagement rather than catastrophic failure . 
   central european rightist parties . 
  like our pis ? 
  i do n't think they care that much . 
   what is it with you poles bickering on the german flairs ? 
  do n't mind that , it 's part of our culture . 
  why ... why to russia ? 
  why to russia i am asking !, 
  oh god ... why do i feel that shame ? 
  if * they * gamble they must knew something . 
  it is still fucking repulsive and we should be shamed for what we allow to happen . 
  did n't communist propaganda painted them as victims of emperor and monarchy ? 
  that being said yes , you are right . 
  damn , too bad it does n't sound in polish so menancing as it sounds in english . 
  because it is perfect perfect description . 
  did you know it is citizens ' initiative ? 
  common citizens , like you and me , made this project and collected signatures under it ? 
  and it forces our government to take this document for reading ? 
  because our law says so ? 
  if it will pass or not it is other thing , but it was n't our politicians who made this project . 
  any more questions ? 
  edit : my comment after your lenghty eddit now looks dumb and shallow . 
  but in short : i will defend 500 + , i 'm socialist , it seems . 
  bono is like 56 , so it is hard to say `` these days '' . . beside , you have to stick out of the crowd somehow . 
  [ i know you might not know much about poland . . but bono ? 
  u2 leader ? 
  ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/05/sorry-bono-but-hyper-nationalists-arent-running-poland/ ), 
  it is quite nice here . 
  do n't listen to bono . 
  like every signle german , whole nation , was oppressed by hitler and his few men ? 
  damn , hitler and stalin , sons of krypton . 
  til every single movie is a documentary . 
  you mean , like * liberating russian minority in poland , also known as poles * ? 
  ooooh , so that 's why russians oppressed us for 50 years !, 
  nah , there is a flu , now we have a fever but the cancer is creeping right behind it . 
  i treat them as a fever during the flu , it is not nice , it is not good , but it is needed and there is a good reason behind that . 
   made by polish in poland i do n't get it . 
  it would be fair to say that jews participates at the whole process . 
  awkward , is n't it ? 
  cologne was done by locals .
