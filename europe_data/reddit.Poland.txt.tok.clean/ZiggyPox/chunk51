  oh god , how angry that whole thing makes me is just unbearable . 
  i think that ttip is , for some time , a major trigger for me and i 'm not even joking . 
   these are the same politicians who wanted to deny abortions under any circumstances #it is , for gods sake , citizens ' legislative initiative that were citizens . 
  in poland you can start a `` obywatelska inicjatywa ustawodawcza '' or ... `` citizens ' legislative initiative '' . 
  all you need is enought signatures and governement * must * consider your initiative . 
  it were * common poles * who started it . 
  http://www.termedia.pl/mz/jest-obywatelska-inicjatywa-ustawodawcza-w-sprawie-aborcji,21366.html but , well , ** fuck that legislative initiative ** , worshipers of * meat * , all of them . 
  uh , but i think that 500 + will do much good for majority or recievers . 
  the problem is : someone owns these robota , and whoever is owning them wo n't willingly share them . 
  once we were at race against each other , man 's hour against a man 's hour . 
  now we all have to race with machines that can do our work 100 times faster . 
  once it was n't problem when they were making work that no man could do , but no more . 
  maybe in iron sky 3 : the game . 
  believe my brother , believe . 
  brexit : makes raptor nazi on the moon real . 
  so in short , marriage is good but forced one is bad : ), 
  there was huge outrage about that , how horrible poland is . 
  i think this follow-up is needed . 
  did n't know that . 
  i wonder why it is so low . 
  is it binding european countries ? 
  you need only one with lots of money to ruin small country . 
  i do n't love pis but lets not pretend that tkm was n't modus operandi of every previous polish government ever . 
  number 1 reason why our bureaucracy is so bloated and has been for years . 
  well , maybe * not * voting was n't that bright idea huh ? 
  slacktivism is n't a real way to change anything ( spoilt vote , on the other hand , would show something ) . 
  also , using your logic which again , anchores on voter turnout , as far as i remember no party had majority , ever . 
  so pis is saying that majority ( biggest chunk ) of people who did care during voting simply voted for them . 
  anyway , if opposition received that 45 % ( majority ) , why did n't they made one voting block ? 
  maybe it is not about being * against * something that counts ? 
  just food for thought . 
  we are reciving the funds under strict restrictions , shaping our economies in toward someones else idea and , in opinion of some euro-prejudiced , toward someones else markets , economies and exports . 
  also eu forces you to take it all - or to take none of it , because if you do n't spend as much as they said you should then they take everything . 
  forced generosity , so people like you can now say how much we take . 
  we are not `` part-time europeans '' , we are europeans . 
  we live in europe and we have our own idea on how things should be , deal with it . 
  if your criteria of who is and is not `` european '' is following one agenda , then i 'm sorry . 
  oh , we are going on again about it ? 
  we need more male teachers , nurses and * students * , am i right ? 
  my father was working with < insert soft drink brand here  managers from romania . 
  boy do they hated roma people like noone else could . 
  he told me how that lady went full ballistic telling how they as soon as see her passport do whole search on her . 
  living in poland is so shitty that terrorists do n't even want to die here . 
  and yet i 'm not moving from here . 
  you might not be happy with his flag flair . 
  95 % cocoa is dark chocolate so bitter it is going to twist your face . 
  it gets you on your feet tho , great for long car drive after midnight . 
  dunno why you think it is `` real '' chocolate . 
  real xocol\u0101tl is a drink , wiki says so . 
   the data for the two missing regions of germany are not present in the eurostat database , and the entries are marked as `` confidential '' . 
  jesus christ not again !, 
  well , too bad that germans of today ca n't enjoy this lost old architecture but man , everything about that war was brutal . 
  hey !, 
  it is only bad * now * . 
  really bad ... 
  huh so it seems it is still too soon for our re-confederation . 
  we miss you . 
  amber . 
  hmm ... those that left clearly does n't share this sentiment , those that stayed cleary are doing nothing ( sensible ) to revive this sentiment . 
  our ruling party can take something dickish somewhere else . 
  preferably deep . 
  \\  implying that any polish expat would be willing to move back to poland . 
  but if this would happen i expect panel\u00e1k renaissance . 
  polish officers are n't the nicest people on the earth . 
  also were n't there some deal for easy crossing between oblast and poland ? 
  well , it is n't like we had problems with islamic and oriental influences in past . 
  we just took what we liked with disregard to whole parent culture . 
  roger amber one , eagle one is sending the chicks , prepare the nests . 
  watch out for the duck , it 's late for its migration . 
  over . 
  errr ... burner phone maybe ? 
  noone tells people to upload it right from their phone . 
  go on your pc or on your r\u03c0 and throw it at liveleak , go on around the city and find open spot ( kinda shitty move ) . 
  upload it on some shitty chan and let the hivemind do the rest . 
  there are ways . 
  soooo ... guys , you are so close anyway ... wan na join poland ? 
  do n't say if answer would put you in jail , just blink . 
  you beat it does !, 
  apple juice is awsome too , but it has to ... mature to its full potential , tee hee . 
  listen , all i want is a bottle of mango juice from time to time and you can by that buy yourself three dedicated pro-eu voters . 
  i think it is worth some pro-mango tailored european found committee < wink , wink  . 
  seriously , this thing is * good * . 
  all i want for poland is what i saw in germany and only then i will say that eu is a fair deal : 100 % mango juice avaible in polish shop in reasonable price . 
  this is my demand . 
  oh maan , i find these things sooo pretty . 
  do n't tell them * the plan * !, 
  i mean it . 
  together we can make something bigger than that . 
  #make commonwealth great again,
