  how often do you have sowy weather like that ? 
  honest question . 
  oh this * is * a cult , but the one that makes you cozzy inside and do n't requires you to bend over for sexual relief of your guru . 
  better than the cult of money tho ' .

  *   frantically checks if pm-84 glauberyt is still there , hidden udner trench coat < < *,

  straight men are watching resbian women but straight women do n't wach gay man ( mostly ) . 
  juices rains from above !, 
  would they even be able to manage such data ? 
  in poland you can go from place to place just by going to the window at the station and paying for the ticket in cash . 
  we can send you that gravel back if you are so attached to it . 
  if you really cared for these monuments you should n't left then where they do n't belong in the first place . 
  white trash . 
  cute . 
  you could familiarize yourself with the term `` cycle of poverty '' . 
  there are people in shitty situations where they can put 10 times of an effort that a common , well-off person puts everyday * and * still be stuck in a shithole . 
  object in motion stays in motion , object at rest stays at rest yadda yadda . 
  read up about cycle of poverty . 
  r/whatcouldgowrong everything is dangerous around wrong people . 
  sometimes the body grows faster than the brain . 
  italian cuisine is greatest gift of all cultures so whatever is going on i will be standing by your side . 
  `` nude '' mhm , that recollection of a nipple ? 
  i 've seen more of a boob in the park with breastfeeding mother or just by looking at girl who was picking something from the floor . 
  oh well , office space is office space . 
  he `` admired '' them in efficiency of killing terrorists while , still , calling them bad guys . 
   `` he was a bad guy -- really bad guy . 
  but you know what ? 
  he did well ? 
  he killed terrorists . 
  he did that so good . 
  they did n't read them the rights . 
  they did n't talk . 
  they were terrorists . 
  over . 
  today , iraq is harvard for terrorism , '' i would n't call it admiration . 
  hmm , i did n't take into account your points . 
  you are right in what you are saying . 
  ( but i still find hillary to be evil hehe ) . 
  the one he did n't vote for every invasion of us troops in the middle east . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  it was razor-thin win for him now and trump was the lesser evil for swinger votes . 
  in case sanders vs trum sanders would be the lesser evil . 
  trump won because h. clinton was the other option . 
  i 'm on the side of turkish cooks here . 
  but man , you are one fine guy . 
   i watched islamic terrorists murder 3000 people in cold blood in person nice neighborhood you have there . 
  what was that , world trade center ? 
  since when bristol is located in us ? 
  you might be living on the same rock but you are not living in the same world . 
  i was ugly little kid so no predator was interested in me hahaha . 
  but many my girlfriends ( friends that were girls ) had a hard crush on few older guys like on our teacher for example . 
  it is not that kids get fooled by someone but when you are spending hours and hours in a room with smart , eloquent , mature and even little bit handsome man that is protective * and * in a position of power then sometimes this guy only has to * reach * for what girls are willing to give him . 
  and here i 'm talking about normal shit-for-brains teenager so when you are start counting shit-for-brains teenagers * with issues * then oh boy it is getting ugly . 
  kids are volunable and easilly shaped , that 's why gangs , drug dealers and other trash are aiming at them . 
  man , you are asking silly question . 
  the difference in power makes it easy to manipulate young people into sex , into awkward sex , into group sex . 
  you can tell 14 year old any bullshit and by sole fact that you are 25 years old you are god to her , you can throw money , you are `` mature '' , you can buy anything , know anything ( in their perspective ) and hell , they can have fun around you becaue you wo n't police them as their parents do . 
  that is also why relationships between student and teacher , between boss and his worker are frowned upon , this reliance and power dynamics comes into play . 
  we as society are saying that ** `` kids under age x has shits for brains and ca n't fully consent to sex '' ** . 
  because your joy from death of one idiot is bothering me and , by your standards , i ca n't wait for my turn to be happy : ) also nuance is important when you need it : well , * you * are , how that was going ... `` misrepresenting complex sociopolitical issues '' , this man is only an expression of a pattern in cultural clash that is an outcome of botched immigration and assimilation politics . 
  your characterization of this person is `` pathetically lacking in nuance . '', 
  yeak , you like to turn minor offenders into human trash used to spin the prison industry . 
  put a petty thief behind the bars and after a year or two you have full grownup gang member . 
  you have shitty crime situation . 
  nope , these were shitty days . 
  how do you feel about al-andalus ? 
   internet people . 
  one of us . 
  one of us . 
  i heard bicycles are trendy . 
  few times i have been reading , even here on r/europe how for example in germany work-life balance was fine to the moment where , for example , poles appeared who could slave longer for lesser pay . 
  and the that is taken for a norm . 
  the employer quickly takes what is good for granted , like everyone , but to the point where at my place we had other company doing gig/work for us * for free * `` only once , special case '' as they said . 
  we had one guy that knew other guy and some promises of partnership were made . 
  they did great work . 
  long story little less long : for the next project they services were also written into the budget , and the cost was written as ** zero ** off the bat . 
  they refused to do the job for free again saying that was not their idea of partnership . 
  managment was surprised that they do n't want to work for free . 
  they were surprised that people do n't want to work for free . 
  they were surprised * and * angry . 
  also , about your point :  i only expect people to do their jobs , i do n't care how they work . 
  it is fine and dandy but my boss used to give jobs impossible to do and the part `` i do n't care how they work '' is `` you ca n't do it in workhours then take work to home '' . 
  all i 'm saying is that they need to hire a second guy or a better guy and maybe give him better tools when we are at it because i wo n't bend myself into a pretzel to turn duck into a horse . 
  as for today they did not hire second or better guy . 
  some might say that i 'm lazy or that i have bad attitude . 
  first is not true , second one might be true . 
  i will fix this when they will pay me for the overtime hours i worked for them . 
  that 's why i said that i think puting a bullet in his head would be more merciful . 
  there are cases , like the case of breivik that i think puting a bullet in his head would be more merciful than holding him like a rat in a gilded cage . 
  ehhh , i have been thinking about that and despite the fact that i also would like to see him rot in prison i think prolonged , permanent isolation , if looked from right angle is sanctioned and socially acceptable for of torture . 
  it is not about resocialization anymore , it is for us to feel good . 
  we only catch beasts , monsters in human skin alive to be sure we did n't make a mistake and then we keep them alive because we can never be sure we never made a mistake and * something something * humanitarianism . 
  but in this situation the point was to remove him pernamently from the society , by the means of bullet or by the means of bars . 
  by opening fire he made his case clear . 
  so i think i should be fine with him being dead . 
  the point was made , the goal reached , he is gone and no more dangerous .
