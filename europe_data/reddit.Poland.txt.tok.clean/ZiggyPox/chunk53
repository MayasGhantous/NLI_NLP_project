  too bad cop got wounded . 
  i think i have found the head of ministry of education of kaliningrad region . 
  how fast you can learn one true language of free people ? 
  i think one guy monitoring terrorist costs as much as 20 monitoring twitter . - . 
  i 'm still surprised that they found enought people able to monitor terrorists . 
  oh my ... stay strong . 
  in defense of germany i think people in care of hunting twitts are n't the kind of people who could manage more serious things like monitoring terrorists . 
  looks like something uruk-hai would make . 
  hail the dark lord . 
  and this is imaginary one . 
  as a pole i can tell you that : you can get used to it . 
  upside to this is that our lethal dose of salt is over 900 % of the norm by the acquired immunity . 
  you could always say `` przepraszam prosz\u0119 pana '' . 
   kaliningrad region because we have * a plan * . 
  by the way , i 'm looking for polish minority in kaliningrad region . 
  soo , where are the international waters of the internet ? 
  everything is better priced in germany ; _ ;, 
  what did you say ??? 
  someone hold my beer !, 
  it is * little * bit better . 
  we are like a fungus on the wall . 
  touch us and be prepared for consequences . 
  go to work , go to shop , go back home , repeat and die just before you go to retirement . 
  politicians model citizen and wet dream . 
  haha , oh , nice diggingm * new user * . 
  i asked about dbi assassination because it is the first time i heard about that . 
  what are you tryting to stir up , * new user * , hmmmm ? 
  that is no fallacy . 
  when on the one side we were nagged how bad we are for not taking just 6k there was parallel discussion on the immigrant distribution where quotas were rising from week to week as the talks went further . 
  you know , it would be the case * if * these numbers were n't constantly growing . 
  that was kinda funny when we were shamed for a dynamic nubmer that was x +1500 ( per week ) . 
  also , why would you force * anyone * to live in poland ? 
  you sadist . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth#economy til sweden equals whole europe . 
  potatoes and pork ... my childhood . 
   the police want to use new dna analysis to investigate , but are prevented from doing so by laws based on data protection i never thought that data protection law could be coverign criminals dna in criminal case . 
  was that law intentionally written so ? 
  you like to turn the lights off ? 
  it is not really intention , it is cause . 
  if lets say you kill someone `` to ease the pain '' but it turns out he/it did n't feel the pain in the first place then your intention goes out of the window and everything turns awkward . 
  also if you kill a human * person * to eat and animal to eat then you have two separated cases . 
  then we have non-human persons like dolphins and higher primates and it gets problematic . 
  you ( or rather most people ) would n't eat your dog ( or someones dog ) but you would eat wild , feral dog if faced with starvation death , why so ? 
  emotional attachment ? 
  worth of socialized animal ? 
  i could go on and on . 
  everything you said i know haha . 
  the thing is not all pain is equal and not all emotions are as complex as other ones . 
  that 's why i think eating fish is ok but eating gorilla meat is sad . 
  and the fact that pig are so tasty is just tragedy . 
   killing someone `` someone '' is here the problem . 
  if you allready has `` someone '' then killing is almost always bad . 
  i only eat animals that were murdered in humane way  also , even if you only eat grain and grass still the whole agriculture will murder more birds and rats and dogs and cats than you could even eat ( if you wanted ) . 
  also i 'm not against child euthanasia when there are serious , serious defects but then i do n't think it should be `` on demand by the mothers wish '' . 
  it is funny when people try to stump me with the vege thing , what if i 'm human supremacist ? 
  nah , self-awarness it is only one of the many parts that are important . 
  ability to feel pain and emotions , distress , appears before 18 month and that 's why you ca n't rip apart a newborn without good reason just as you ca n't do that to a kid in third trimester . 
  it 's a logarithmic scale . 
  when my body is alive but i 'm braindead then person is dead . 
  meat is just the hardware . 
  i have fetish for ugly things and mixing ugly with pretty . 
  oh shit , this explains a lot ... 
  or for me a person is just something more than a meat , a person is a mind and not in its proto-form that is n't able to form memories , experience surrounding and/or contain personality . 
  i think abortion on demad to a point is n't bad thing , but it might be just my inner barbarian speaking . 
  it is no different from pro-life zeals americans that are making their own drafts of the bills and laws and protests . 
  does usa want to ban all abortion ? 
  and to deny a lot of things . 
  and how they should be punished ? 
  hundred lashes ? 
  all abrhamic religions in their pure form are primitive and cruel in todays standards , even if you can find some good sides of them . 
  `` and we rained upon them a rain [ of stones ] . 
  then see how was the end of the criminals . '', 
  these parts of the reddit are almost the most fun ones . 
  when someone is voted into power and you are sure he will endanger democrazy ( heh ) then it somehow turns into `` fuck democracy '' . 
  just as in trump case . 
  i think this part is somewhat against homosexual people : https://quran.com/7/80-81 from the `` plebby cesspool '' , with love . 
  does n't your own country has `` fuck democracy '' law in case when wrong people get to the power ?

  it is great you all can be friends now but oh my god why you could n't be friends then ? 
  it is anger and hapiness . 
  and you guys here can sit and talk about it like it was yesterdays afternoon show . 
  it is good , it is great , but i still have conflicting feelings about that . 
  just my pointless opinion . 
   clinton foundation  something sketchy hahaha , my sides ... 
  i 'm sorry , it might not be a constructive comment on my side but man , if you thing that thing is * something * sketchy then you are for biiiig surprise after first few google results . 
  hmm , it depends . 
  many of these names are just very mundane , like `` goat like legs '' or `` from top to bottom '' , just in the original language , but they would know how to name these things just as we know how to name our stuff that surrounds us . 
  actually , after discovering pompeii ruins it was * trendy * to know this and that . 
  there was also an art of * reading * paintings , their meaning and symbolism even in most mundane pieces : http://www1.umassd.edu/euro/2011papers/siegel.pdf so it kinda depends if it was invented , reinvented or imported like in case of asian art but mostly yes , as it would make * great * conversation starter . 
   eroding basic human rights can in no way come back to haunt you . 
  not that i 'm for eroding basic human rights , but i can list few assholes that did n't fell any personal consequences of that . 
  duda vetoed 2/3 packages afair . 
  there is ongoing judicial reform , but not in whole , only in part . 
   failure to implement correctly council decisions ( eu ) 2015/1523 and 2015/1601 on relocation wow , how nicely they bolded it out ... 
  but yeah , `` judicial reform package '' is kinda bigger problem than rest of these things i think . 
  that 's the only thing i like about him . 
  oh oh , that pic got streisand effect-struck as far as i remember . 
  good times . 
   at first i was triggered but then you made me laugh and lastly they made me polish . 
  fify,
