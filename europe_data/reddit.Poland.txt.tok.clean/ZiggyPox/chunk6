  ] ( https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/39334/racism+is+not+just+about+colour ) oh maaaan , this west is sooo progressive !, 
  do you remember how people were outraged when that polish idiot attacked that portuguese kid ? 
  or that ? 
  [ from being a nation of ` hard-working people ' , we became poster children for the unskilled labour force ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-here%e2%80%99s-what-it%e2%80%99s-really-like-being-polish-in-ireland-344425-feb2012/ ) ... ok , i think i need to stop ... 
  i think i 'm getting little bit angry . 
  last time we were ( almost ) part of zsrr everyday life was overshadowed by cold war . 
  eh , it is then quite easy to show popular idea into populist light as a means to win an argument . 
  [ i see your kawaii , i raise by my oldman ] ( http://adala-news.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/oldman-manhua-tome-1-3.png ), 
  system of distributing refugees acros europe ** on our terms . 
  you think we could pass as 15 years old children ? 
  sorry , nobody cares now . 
  we joined it with the idea of partnership , not of being a vassal state of someones grandoise idea . 
  if you want to call dibs on who was first then yeah , eastern expansion was surely a mistake , we should have been swallowed by russia and make you sleep uneasy at night . 
  i 'm only waiting for polish motif in * vinland saga * , then i will be happy . 
  but manga face puts me off little bit . 
  and i said that i would rather pay to keep them in greece than in germany . 
  you can keep * more * of them in greece and/or at the better standards because , simply , it would be * cheaper * . 
  i think i would rather pay greece rather than germany for keeping immigrants . 
  oh how nice of you . 
  ok , lets do it like that : this is also our eu now so you take all the claimants or you get out from eu because we say so : ), 
  ha , so in short these * are * colours of pro-russian puppet states !, 
  that dirty mother f. . . 
  um . . looking at the landmas ... you would be taking belarus or belarus would be taking you ? 
  are these colours of that pro-russian puppet state ? 
  and poland likes nobody : ), 
  if i say that we are really , really sorry would you give us second chance ? 
  do you know `` albanian gang '' ? 
  [ you ought to know !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fws8hwdtddq ) if you have any questions i have answers , but there is no much sense behind them . 
  our grudges are akin to national treasure . 
  we had many other national treasures , but most of them were stolen in the war . 
  https://prawda2.info/viewtopic.php?t=4406 my uncle is a farmer and you are wrong . 
  in many cases a farmr is binded by contracts to follow these rules . 
  fyi, 
  because farmers will choose 2t yeld rather than 1t yeld disregarding any long-term consequences . 
  this is like askin why china is still exporting cancerous plastic products . 
  with another nobel peace prize ? 
  the thing is that populist ideas does n't have to be * bad * ideas . 
  is n't safety in workspace populist idea ? 
  or just pay ? 
  or healthcare ? 
  and then eu would set quota for smashed puppies per capita . 
   they will no longer be hired through public contests i will tell you how public `` contests '' worked so far in poland : if it was for the office you would get 2 part : test and talk . 
  even if you would score 100 % on test you could , at need , be scored `` less communicative '' than person of the examination committee choosing . 
  as for contracts if you have a company you would like to win you just add some strange requirement `` sompany has to be able to provide 600 red aluminium handles , square in shape at the moments notice when entering the contest '' and inform said company that have to stack such ridiculous shit in their warehouse and you got it . 
  it is no more control . 
  it is just lobbists at the right place . 
  you mean czechia ? 
  polish system transformation of '89 in nutshell . 
  uh huh . . it 's no * raise * if it was always like that here . 
  heeeeey ... 
  i think i like you !, 
  i do n't say they are , i said we , as poland , are . 
  read my comment again and look at my flair . 
  also looking how meddling in middle east has turned out for us makes me * extra * dubious of us ability to judge which side of history is the * right * side . 
  be horrible , poor , cheap and unwelcoming twats as we are . 
  hey , it works !, 
  * `` trust , but verify '' *, 
  oh no no no my friend , i will give you * a lift * to the border * personally * and then wave you for goodbye as you go into horizon . 
  well ... [ it has pink insignia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/ensign_of_the_ukrainian_ground_forces.svg ) so maybe ? 
  of ukrainian ground forces or ukrainian border patrol . 
  you could also say hi from me to savchenko if we are at it . 
  nah man , it is fun here . 
  blackjack and hookers and all that swag . 
  but in the uniform of my choosing if you yet have to discover telephone . 
  go and tell that to crimeans . 
  i think you can move again if you do n't like it . 
  edit : nah , i 'm not controversial , it 's just a polish thing . 
  it seems you have a lot of catching up to do . 
  oh , and there are no notifications if you edit your post : ), 
  man , to think i would find someone more hateful than me . 
  hands down . 
  oh if only they could know how poles can hate other poles ... 
  and yet it seems everyone here reads polish media . 
  well , most polish movies that are recognized in any way are about war or about war with focus on jews so it might seem that there is a slight bias . 
  but these are good movies , yes . 
  i have a mug with logo of `` wybi\u00f3rcza '' on my desk . 
  i like my coffe extra bitter ( but the aftertaste of shit is annoying ) . 
   while his death will be relatively quick and painless versus the torture of a whole life in jail . 
  well , that is what pisses me off . 
  we pretend to be humane and lawful but everyone knows he will be tortured . 
  that is a fake , a veil of humanism , play-pretend and it 's revolting . 
  i am not really for reintroducing eye-for-an-eye laws but that man is an anomaly beyond norwegian law system , and now he is prophet rather than a martyr . . but you know , you might be right . 
  i myself could n't overcome such thing and also it might be simply that i am not a good person . 
  it wo n't turn time back but it would be deterrent to fight anyone who would like to follow him . 
  it would also mean closure for victims and their families . 
  now there are people who * cheer * him in his * struggle * . 
  i should write it somewhere down in my will that in case of me being murdered if someone would raise a question `` would he want that man to die ? 
  brievik should have been long dead . 
  it is not about punishing , it is about setting things straight . 
  what brievik did was inhuman in the worst sense of this word . 
  well this is law allright . 
  but this is n't justice .
