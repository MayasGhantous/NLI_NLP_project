  i do n't know man , i could use that extra pair of hands and telepathy from time to time . 
  my great grandma from my mothers side was thrown into prison by germans that were then afraid to touch her as she had cholera symproms , my granddad from father side was thrown into gulag train , made circle around the sybir and come back ( no idea how ) and then was fighting against upa soldiers while during a war his wife was doing unfree labour for german lady . 
  he came back , started drinking , rest is lost in history . 
  a clusterfuck was that war . 
  probably ex-boy/girlfriend . 
  . . or . . swingers ? 
  heh , this is what i find funny . 
  it turns out that common sense is n't ... common . 
  but he is horrible ... 
  now i want a sandwich ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk5io19rhgg seriously , first thing google showed me . 
  espionage and sabotage . 
  yep . 
  funny how poles say they * do n't like * something rather than * outright assault people . 
  * boy , if we only could be as civilized as west ...

  you know , there was a time that being called an antisemite would make your legs shake . 
  abused words are loosing its power . 
  but he might be an antisemite tho . . 
  * frenchmen knew *, 
  just like brazil !, 
  ignore conveniently half of the country that is extremely poor and live in the part that is extremely rich !, 
  problem solved . 
  but seriously , sweden is creating a segregated society with dangerzones . 
  a country that was as free and as open like jesus christ supersta made a huge , huge step back . 
   the superiority you gain through multi culturalism ** and gentle treatment after wwii ** . 
  here , fixed that for you : ), 
  and what else ? 
  drink hot coco ? 
  be a man , play with fire and have fun . 
  just do n't breath fumes . 
  to be honest russian state , after what it did in belarus , deserves to be called murderers . 
  and i ca n't turn on tv : ( anyway , you might love being polish but i might confused you with r/hipokryzja that stated * `` and i do n't '' * . 
  so i take it back , you are not a problem . 
   it 's not national spirit , it 's stale and stinking nationalistic mythology full of martyrdom and illusion of purity where anyone criticizing any aspect of being a pole is called a national traitor . 
  nah , that is what * you * think being pole is about , it is what was the problem all the time . 
  how is that anyone can enjoy any other culture but not his/her own ? 
  nope , i just upvoted you right now to show . - . 
  it depends . 
  if citizen of north korea would tell you that what we are doing in europe is wrong and degenerated you would take into account that he is north korean , yes ? 
  eeee , but eu is giving money for private property . 
  first one : hotels . 
  find a run-down semi-precious property and they will throw money at you . 
  say you want to buy as * private investor * some eco energy and they will throw money at you . 
  they do interfere in free market when they see it fit . 
  and ue chooses for what that money goes . 
  how about that , ue should start dotations for rebuilding neglected shipyards . 
  or what about dotations for importing polish pork ? 
  no good ? 
  that money is n't free . 
  our people are migrating over the whole world so we have some experience in that : ) . 
  better to learn on someones example . 
  first , we were told that on many occasions . 
  second , we do n't want we to collapse , why would we ? 
  wan na make a beat ? 
   patriotism is a given i 'm afraid not . 
  wait wait wait , what was the difference between 3th and 4th invasion force in iraq ? 
  we sens spec-ops so that iraquis wo n't set oil righs on fire . 
  if i would try to be cynic i would say it was * ecological action * . 
  we know why it was n't done : all people that could be harmed by it were in power - direct or indirect . 
   poland was doing pretty well in last 25 years was when sld was a ruling party . 
   collaborating with communists is relevant after 25 years is ludicrous . 
  i 'm sorry , i would go into constructive discussion about all that but this last point ... 
  what will be , not what it was . 
  right now i 'm carrying potential nation in my cohones but it does n't have mind on its own . 
  potential for the thing is there , but the thing itself is n't there yet . 
  and that is basic difference between pro-life and pro-choice . 
  for me the mind is sacred . 
  for you : flesh . 
  you murder a person , anything else is killing . 
  humans are n't persons during their whole existence . 
  before some time in pregnancy , after death and when they are brain-dead under life support they are human , but no more ( not yet ) person . 
  it is killing , yes , but not murder . 
  and further national integration into eu is pointles because ** i am ** against it . 
  you are a pole so you probably know what i meant by that so i wo n't go into lengths . 
  a nation and nationality , identity , is a treasure and i like the aura of appreciation of that . 
  for few years i had that feeling like someone was trying to tell me that polish identity is a ballast in the way of integration , breeding in people national self-hatred . 
  so i can say that i like to be polish and there should n't be reason to be ashamed of that . 
  then go be german or whatever , eu lets you do just that . 
  why live your life unhappy ? 
  naaaah , our values are well-being of our people and solid and safe family . 
  total ban on abortion does n't align with our values and * blindly following * what church has to say is n't a value . 
  looking at the rest of your conversation it all comes to the question `` if few cells are allready a human '' . 
  they are human , but they are not a person ( for a moment ) and i value a person ( for example mother ) infinitely more valuable than anything you biologically can call a human . 
  but i also believe eugenics are n't all that bad so i might be biased . 
  me to , hehhee ... oh these arguments that flow , that outrage . 
  we do n't have `` exceptions '' like that here in poland . 
   `` we have our deal and we have , are , and will be fulfilling our part . 
  we should n't care about what one guy said and i also * ca n't officially * care , as my support dims and with me out of the office any pro-turkey actions are unlike in current social moods '' there . 
   so lets invest in education , technology and innovation , instead of spending a billion pln each months on child subsidies . 
  i think we are going there and that 500 + is a good way to invest in your kids . 
  send them somewhere for holidays , some science camp , some extracurricular activity . 
  i know for myself and my childhood as my parents were n't rich that * some * extra money are needed to be * innovative * and * creative * . 
  no technic for me , had to stick to crayons and only now when i make my own money and yet have no kid to take care of i can tinker all i want . 
   but how do you propose to change it , without changing whole world economy ? 
  give a good scare to the whole of europe that they might end with a rather large , totalitarian country in middle of it ? 
  sometimes things needs to get worse before they will get better * but * when everyone says that nothing can be done then nothing will be done . 
  just like with french revolution . 
  what would be if people said `` oh , but it 's better to be feudal than to start civil unrest and put whole country in flames '' . 
  no it is n't .
