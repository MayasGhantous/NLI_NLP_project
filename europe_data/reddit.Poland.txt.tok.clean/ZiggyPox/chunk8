  and as french revolution was murderous and had its own sins , it was needed . 
   americans would love it if europeans would stop meddling with their politics . 
  oh now that is ironic , is n't it ? 
  a knife ? 
  pepper spray ? 
  oh why would they need that ? 
  or rather `` you told us we were n't allowed to play with fire but you left me in the dark and cold place , what did you expect ? '', 
  and with po behind the wheel we would be turned into mexico of europe , paradise of cheapo outsourcing , nation of cleaners and maids without real industry and any real leverage in europe . 
  we would stay insignificant , nation of temporary workers . 
  we are * always * poor , no matter how much poles are working do n't you see ? 
  and what the hell is wrong with 500 + ? 
  money money money , we pay so elevated taxes but we * never * have money for anything , is n't it strange ? 
  why * any other country * can support their parents but we ca n't ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/child_benefit to hell with this all . 
  i like to be polish . 
  that was nationalism/supremacy . 
  it is like saying that socialism is bolshevism . 
  in 1989 socialist/communist system was overthrown but not people who were ruling over it . 
  we never had true decommunization going on here . 
  i would say something but rest english-speaking poles here would downvote me to hell . 
  i 'm not happy about what is happening right now but it is better than previous government in terms that previous government got too cozzy and full of itself . 
  and i like that comeback of national spirit . 
  the thing is we poles should , from time to time , show that we can be unhappy , just at we did by voting in pis : ), 
  nah , but i would n't mind [ minor saboage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minor_sabotage ) . 
  so what was that about nazi ? 
   independence of public media yes , we should do it slowly like germany . 
  employ right people from the right circle that really , really believe in ** x ** spirit , praise them for their ** x ** spirit and after a time you do n't need to tell them what to write , they will do so out of their free will : ), 
  constitution is broken . 
  deal with it . 
  if it was n't there would n't be chit-chat and venice commission would clearly say `` stop '' rather than `` make out '' . 
  most of the paintings in history , excluding maybe religious paintings of medieval , were made with profit in mind and on demand as painting as profession was expensive ( look : tyrian purple ) , subjects were strongly influenced by what the viewer found fashionable and in many times only way for an artist to express himself was by hidden message . 
  artists who could paint what they wanted to were horribly poor , horribly rich or had second solid income . 
  i 'm not sure , but i 'm sure it is your cake day !, 
  are you surprised ? 
  on the other side if muslim community had more people like that other woman we would n't have such problems . 
  so yes , people say that because there is a reason for that but when we do find moderate muslims that share our values and take part in building better and safer europe then we should praise them . 
  taking into account what a part of islamic world would like to do to her for what she did , that woman is a hero . 
  well , that is a load of cattle manure . 
  that is argument used by modern artists that can not express themselves by technique or idea and they are left with nothing but shock value of their art . 
  nothing less , nothing more but pantacide . 
  never forget 6 million erdogans !, 
  no , these are just people that really , genuinely believe that 's the right thing to do amd just somehow they ended in the right place behind a typewriter . 
  how many competitions have you seen lately , about posters and writting praising immigration , humanism and open borders ? 
  all you need to take those people that take a part in these competitions and that is all , no need to tell them to `` produce '' anything . 
  3 years ago . 
  but let me add that it was in oldtwon * and * near the river bank * and * at night . 
  at the day it was n't so cold ... http://imgur.com/a/mwbol, 
  i remember me and my so taking pictures for her diploma , here in toru\u0144 . 
  it was so cold that the objective broke ... 
  oh , the one where they made a plane disappear ? 
  i love cage < 3 . 
  but we do ban hard drugs to not take part in dirty business . 
  it wo n't stop wars , yes , but this way nobody can force down our throats to take responsibitily for what is going on . 
  we should n't make money by using slave labour , selling hard drugs or gun , it does n't matter if someone else will be doing this . 
  i wonder where silesia went ... anyway , we have enought to matter and imagine that if you are significant power vs another significant power then having a footing in the middle of europe makes you ** the ** power . 
  not ** that ** accident ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38dghy5eau, 
  new equipment that was bought 5 years ago that was meant to work for next 10 is gone , it was removed as `` wybrakowane '' because some idiots did n't know what to do with that ( or worse , they sold it somewhere ) . 
  my father was a `` starszy chor\u0105\u017cy sztabowy '' before they restructurized this rank and as far as he tells and as far as i can tell there is strong need for restructurization . 
  we are one tasty piece . 
  i do n't mind arms copmanies as long as they do n't * directly * fuel conflicts . 
  i do n't see why they ca n't branch into , for example , construction machinery ... oh , i know why ... how to sell piece of iron and piece of wood for as much as you can ? 
  make a gun out of it . 
  every time i had to spend some time in warsaw it made my only more convinced that i do n't want to live in warsaw . 
   do you speak german and understand the song text completely or did you just see translations ? 
  i was asking about the song . 
  and as far as i know album was `` temporarily banned '' , forcing band to stock somewhere 85,000 copies . 
  how much would cost you to stack 85,000 cds somewhere ? 
  z\u0142oty is awsome and it stays : ) unless you rename $ for something like euroz\u0142oty . 
  so how about that , lets build bunch of drilling rigs in mena , lets build military bases and mines and just siphon these resources to europe . 
  because sovereingty is silly , is n't it ? 
  a german that does n't think that poland is just annoying spot on the map ? 
  a german that says germany is n't self-sufficient titan ? 
  oh my friend , we have some heavy drinking to do !, 
  and we should invite bunch like minded eastern europeans while we are at it !, 
  what is lost in translation ? 
  is there a reason to not love rammstein ? 
  well . . beside that accident ... 
  but still it would n't be magically un-infested as beetles does n't attack that part of tree . 
  does n't this beetle attack a bark of a tree an outer layer ? 
  i think you still could use rest of a tree and , if anything , you can turn that log into particle board . 
  beside national tv nothing was touched and i yet have to see a hunt for jurnalists writing against gov. 
  and it is only * one * kind of contraception * pill * that is getting * maybe * banned in * prescription-free * form . 
  not that i like it but it is blown out of proportion . 
  whatever , i will just enjoy my terror-free country . 
  do n't terrorists from some time use burner phones ? 
  even if you have everything transparent you ca n't tackle that . 
  you think if west was n't rich it would have time to build better society ? 
  with economic growth comes cultural growth . 
  it is easy for a rich person to be happy and nice . 
  whatever your federation would give you it seems it would n't rid you from your arrogance . 
  * oh and boo hoo , being closed for weast would be soooo xenophobic . 
  not very progressive . 
  eu hand was moved by stagnation and decline . 
  there was need to export , there was need for cheap labor . 
  longer it would wait the bigger would a chance for something akin to soviet union reemerge , for russia to spread its influence over former states of its block or worse for eu , ex-soviet states would create their own , intermarium union . 
  that was not enlightenment , that was headstart after wwii . 
  when countries could rebuild * other * countries under soviet clutch were drained from resources . 
  why ddr is still catching up to the rest of germany ? 
  because they were * unenlightened * ? 
  noo , that 's not it .
