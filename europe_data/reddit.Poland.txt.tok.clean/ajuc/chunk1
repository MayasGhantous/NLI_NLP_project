they fear nato because nato might stop their bullying in the region , 
  because no sanctions . 
  countries are nessesary constructs that were created by people everywhere they lived because of natural needs like preventing crime , solving disputes , funding infrastructure etc. 
  if you banished all countries in 100 years they would exist again , and in the meantime there would be a lot of suffering . 
  people calling them outdated are as wrong as people foretelling `` end of history '' 20 years ago . 
  i do n't know if i even want to have that discussion , because usa doing propaganda does n't change the fact that russia does it . 
  but ok - let 's see . 
  american values in 99 % are western values . 
  idividualism over collectivism . 
  freedom of speech over censorship . 
  separation of religion and state . 
  democracy over absolutism . 
  the few values that differ on the surface ( consumerism , capitalism over socialism , gun law ) are n't inherently different in europe either - see switzerland for gun law , ee for capitalism , the whole world for consumerism . 
  all of these are in europe just in different countries . 
  usa would fit as a regular country in western europe culturaly , it is n't more different than spain from norway . 
  usa was founded by europeans and it really shows . 
  and anyway - what you call propaganda is just entertainment . 
  hollywoood , rock and roll and rap is n't financed by government , it 's just american culture . 
  by that logic manga and anime is japanese propaganda , harry potter is english propaganda and don quichote and flamenco is spanish propaganda . 
  people choosing capitalism over alternatives is just common sense - see for yourself how countries that choosen `` communism '' did . 
  even china switched in everything except name . 
  regarding nazi tv shows - which ones ? 
  i do n't watch tv , so i may be out of loop . 
  and ultranationalism towards usa ? 
  seriously ? 
  i know a lot of nationalists , but all of them are polish , ukrainian or german nationalists , nobody is usa nationalist in poland - that would be dumb even for them  i think you 're just at the period in your life when you think everybody are blind and only you can see the truth . 
  wake up sheeple etc. 
  it passes - life is much more complicated , there 's no conspiracy , just dumb and greedy people everywhere . 
  the propagandist is the man who invades country his country promised in a treaty to protect , says he wants peace , is for international law , is conservative and does n't want anything to change . 
  who calls every single ukrainian that does n't want to be russian protectorate a nazi , while he makes law persecuting minorities in russia , stopping free press and freedom of speech and pays for brainwashing campaing in government media in russia on huge scale . 
  you do n't annex parts of country that you guaranteed teritorial integrity . 
  and if you do - you do n't call yourself `` pro-international law '' . 
  regarding the products - this `` change the subject '' conversation tactics you used is lost on me , but if you really want to know i do n't own anything made in usa or uk that i know of . 
  on the other hand i have lots of stuff made in china , south korea and poland . 
  as to english being universal language - it was latin before , and roman empire was long dead , what 's the problem ? 
  it was very funny read , thank you . 
  i especially liked this part :  running like a thread through the [ putin ] speech is a deep commitment to international law interpreted in the most conservative way on the basis of legal documents , treaty texts and court decisions . 
  the creative efforts of ( as putin would put it ) self-interested western reinterpretation of international law ( such as r2p ) are spurned as rationalisations for violating it . 
  reminded me of 1984 . 
  good job , propagandists . 
  nobody will invade you . 
  if your current economic politics will continue you will just default and collapse again and again , until every part worth anything will chose somebody else to care for them ( china most probably ) . 
  nope , it 's not clear w\u00f3dka , it 's flavoured , at least the classic version . 
  but yes - it 's good . 
  polish : [ akurat - `` do prostego cz\u0142owieka '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wchlvzbxjy ) - protest song by polish jewish interwar poet juliusz tuwim sung by modern polish ska-band akurat [ english translation ] ( http://www.antoranz.net/curiosa/zbior7/c0710/20071014-qzm02062_tuwim.htm ) [ incognito - `` zga\u015bnij ksi\u0119\u017cycu '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7z-hk0tyjc ) poem by andrzej bursa [ czes\u0142aw niemen - `` dziwny jest ten \u015bwiat '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btdqepkkw5i ) [ maryla rodowicz - `` hej soko\u0142y '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qrytisrni0 ) old polish folk song . 
  the one song every drunken pole will sing at some point . 
  [ edyta g\u00f3rniak - `` to nie ja '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl5rmmpihp8 ) [ verba - `` mogli\u015bmy '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9evjk5yoh3k ) [ w\u0142\u00f3cz\u0119gi - `` tylko we lwowi '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhbiahiddj8 ) prewar song about lw\u00f3w ( now l'viv ) by famous comedians . 
  it 's in lw\u00f3w dialect . 
  portugese airspace was violated according to them . 
  the main difference between these parties is interpretation of what happened in smole\u0144sk . 
  i live in lublin too , and i think \u017buk will win ? 
  it is n't matter of party in regional elections anyway , and 90 % of my friends say they will vote \u017buk . 
  many of them will vote pis in national elections , but they like what \u017buk did . 
  lublin is weird , because 1/5th of citizens are students mostly from other cities , so they get to live here , but are usually registered and vote elsewhere ( if at all ) . 
  additionaly many young people are registered in lublin but live in warsaw , so they often do n't vote at all . 
  so old people get to decide . 
  btw pis-po is n't about old vs young anymore , po is n't as popular as it was before ( that 's what you get for being in power for 2 terms ) . 
  they do n't know what to do with their eastern part already . 
  no , really there 're differences . 
  compare starogardzka or balsam pomorski ( cheap shit we drank in high school ) and \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka or \u017bubr\u00f3wka . 
  of course some people like to overstate the differences , just like with wine , whisky/whiskey , beer etc. 
  with w\u00f3dka there 's actually less hype and more reality imho . 
  also if you drink to get drunk all the differences are lost anyway . 
  more like latin . 
  but you voted them recently ? 
  ok , bohemian city . 
  they created it after all . 
  i thought bohemia was considered ancestor of modern czech republic ? 
  impossible to keep it synchronised ( from 28 countries each 4 years at least 1 is bound to have shortened term because of corruption or catastrophe or whatever ) . 
  also in case some country went retard/evil/nazi / whatever - with synchronized elections its neighbors would need to wait full 4 years before reacting if their government was n't up to the task , now it 's on average 2 years . 
  and i do n't see any benefits . 
  if you have advertising in your country name it 's probably because you lack the advertised thing in reality . 
  like '' ** democratic ** republic of x '' , '' ** great ** britain '' , `` commonwealth of ** independent ** states '' , or my favorite example '' ** holy ** ** roman ** ** empire ** '' . 
  edit : ok , great britain apparently is n't about how great that country is . 
  shame on my for not knowing that , also shame it 's so , i liked the idea of so blatant advertising . 
  acta was , something else too ? 
  sorry i somehow remembered it was 80 . 
  i do n't believe in retirement of my generation anyway - makes no business sense when you consider polish age structure . 
  i wonder if they consider wroc\u0142aw german or czech ? 
  in my country government did these things in 3 years : - signed acta - increased retirement age to ~ ~ 80 ~ ~ 67 - increased vat from 22 % to 23 % - moved half of savings from private to national retirement fund guess which one of these made people mass-protest on the streets , and which one of these was canceled to appease people ? 
  internet is serious business . 
  i meant to buy a flat . 
  rent is weird , certainly price is n't linear vs area here . 
  well , the people that came to uk to work and tell how poor poland is are mostly from worse-off regions , and have incentive to show everybody they made the right choice . 
  poland is actually ok place to live , just not as good as uk yet . 
  yes , you can live on that ( most poles earn as much or less ) , but in big cities you can easily earn more if you have good education and a few years of experience . 
  teachers are going to be stuck on that till retirement on the other hand ( unless they do no-tax homeschooling on the evenings , which many do ) . 
  young teachers of course get less ( about 1800 iirc ) . 
  as to `` live well '' - 3000 pln can buy you about 0.5 square meter of a flat in any of the big cities . 
  how much `` floor '' in a big city can you buy for average salary in uk ? 
  an have n't we recently changed our gdp calculations to include crime , drugs , etc ? 
  so it will work . 
  why ? 
  traditional media are going the way of opera and theatre . 
  it 's ok imho - they were n't particulary good influence anyway . 
  they were showing world how politicians wanted them to , politicians are still fighting over who controls the media , and people care even less . 
  internet is much better at providing information to people , so they care more ( also free porn ) . 
  the 13 months salaries are popular in many countries ( some do 14 even ) but it 's just gimmick , what matters is how much you make , nto how it is divided during the year . 
  for example teachers in poland get 13 salaries , but it 's still under 3000 pln a month for most of them anyway . 
  only in poorest regions of poland it pays to be a teacher .
