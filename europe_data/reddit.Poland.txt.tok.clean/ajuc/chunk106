  we do n't steal words , we just borrow . 
  we will return them all some day , promise . 
  shambles ? 
  the plan is to invade you if nato does n't help us . 
  as the old saying goes - you do n't have to be faster than lion , just faster than the slowest victim . 
  i 'm fed up with people complaining about things i think are good ( kids going earlier to school , taking in immigrants , approving the in vitro ) as if the world was goinng to end . 
  i 'm also fed up with po not doing the things they promised ( liberal reforms ) , but they still do better than the other parties . 
  edit : so i changed my mind . 
  will vote razem . 
  damn the `` never vote left '' , i want these people in parliament more than all the other parties . 
  still disagree about economy , but so what . 
  just do n't want them to actually be the majority , 
  looking at the title i thought he was killed . 
  just firing him seems very civilized for fsb . 
  my father teaches in a technical farming high school in eastern poland . 
  they have a lot of young people from all over europe ( it has one of the few beekeepers ' courses in europe ) . 
  there are a lot of kids from belarus , baltic states , russia , ukraine , germany , even kazachstan . 
  this month my father had to throw one muslim kid out of the boarding ( he will have to find a private room somewhere in that village ) because the kid drank too much , 
  how many male and female teachers have you had ? 
  i have n't said it 's `` as difficult '' , i just said it 's more difficult for men than for women to be a good teacher , just as it is more difficult for women than for men to be a good miner . 
  on average . 
  yes i 'm sexist because i think men and women are on average different because of their biology , including their behaviour . 
  now that you established that you are better person than me , can we continue discussion without name calling ? 
  brain is just as physical as muscles . 
  i agree . 
  i also think this should be considered as valid opinion for the reasons there are less women in stem and policits . 
  sadly , it only works one way . 
  i agree .

  no shit . 
  and most miners are male . 
  they will liberate burgundy , 
  still you have to have 10 000 rounds of anti-tank ammunition . 
   right now poland has almost as many modern battle tanks as russian army , and its only going to go up not really . 
  russia has like 10 000 + main battle tanks . 
  most wo n't even drive , but still , 
  tbh the whole contest for the first constitution is meaningless . 
  poland had constitution at least since `` nihil novi '' . 
  it just was n't called constitution then . 
  magna carta also could be called `` constitution '' . 
  it 's mostly a pr thing , it 's much better to see what freedoms the laws guaranteed to people and when . 
  but i think 3rd reich is a counterexample . 
  fur trade is n't what it once was . 
  but we are n't neighbors ? 
  country : poland favorite neighbour : slovakia least favorite neighbour : russia, 
  poland bought recently : - f-16 - apv patria ( kto rosomak ) - leopard 2a4 and 2a5 tanks - stealth jaasm missiles - nsm and rbs anti-ship missiles and a lot of smaller stuff , like bms systems , uavs , tracked artillery chasis for krab , all terrain vehicles , quads , etc. 
  we 're also buying caracal helicopters from france , some other helicopters for direct combat , patriot aa missiles from usa , and will need to buy a few hundred tracked ifvs in a few years . 
  also a replacement for old su planes , and then ( that probably in next decade ) for the mig-29 . 
  probably another f-16 or f-35 . 
  also possibly new submarines , but it will depend on many factors . 
  it 's a lot of possible contracts just for poland . 
  ee growth is prognosed at around 2-5 % per year . 
  russia growth is prognosed at around 0 % per year  oil prices will eventually grow back , but in the meantime ee will have healthy diversified growth , and russia will have stagnation or depression . 
  russia alos produces most of its weapons , while ee buys most of it . 
  i think france had no other rational choice . 
  we are n't , these are leftovers from communist times ( also some used migs we bought from germany ) . 
  you do n't buy foreign weapons using ppp money . 
   nominal gdp for 2015 , from wikipedia :  romania + estonia + latvia + lithuania + czech republic + hungary + poland + slovakia = $ 215.302 billion + $ 23.113 billion + $ 34.118 billion + $ 42.642 billion + $ 180.789 billion + $ 126.691 billion + $ 491.239 billion + $ 87.528 billion = $ 1.2 trillion  russia $ 1.176 trillion see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nc7ib/poland_and_other_eastern_european_nato_countries/cvmze8x, 
  nice . 
  would you also want peace on earth and to end the starvation in africa ? 
  because in politics you trade things for other things , and refuges are minor problem and big trading card . 
  i think it 's the same . 
  and i 'm happy that kopacz agreed to take the migrants , because in the end russian agression is a serious problem , and migrant crisis is blown by right-wing media out of proportion . 
  if you disagree - ask ukrainians , if tehy would prefer to take 1 000 000 refuges instead of the war . 
  if north korea has nukes , so can ukraine . 
  the amount and the realistic threat they create for other countries is another matter . 
  that 's a problem of these people , is n't it ? 
  polish mountainers infantry ( podhale rifles ) used a swastika as their symbol until 1945 . 
  it was also used on traditional mountainers clothes , etc. 
  they fought against hitler . 
  it was just a nice logo , used by many people for centuries , till hitler fucked it up for everybody . 
  they are one these political movements that benefit from not opening their mouths , 
  that should be illegal in any civilized country . 
  do n't you have privacy rights ? 
   if actual smoking takes decades to kill how does 2nd hand smoking kill ? 
  through decades ? 
  it works that way because it increases risks slightly but in huge amount of people , over long time . 
  more people die because of passive smoking than because of murderers . 
  in developed countries it 's few orders of magnitude more . 
  world-wide 490 000 are murdered per year , and 600 000 die because of passive smoking . 
  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-26/passive-smoking-kills-600000-a-year-study/2352570 if police ignored murderers you would n't even notice the difference ( a few-few dozen more deaths a year ) . 
  but the small amount means , that even using huge amount of resources for the few cases - is insignificant part of the budget . 
  `` do n't kill people '' is common sense too . 
  as it should be . 
  it was used for any non-slavic people at first . 
  the plural is niemcy . 
  natural languages are n't enginereed . 
  this is n't unique to english . 
  usually when people see language changed enough , that spelling is becoming a nusiance - they reform the spelling . 
  using phonetic ( latin ) script letters as parts of pictograms randomly connected to the way it 's supposed to be read is just stupid . 
   no = no\u0142 , now = na\u0142  dont expekt inglisz wowyls tu map tu de sejm sa\u0142nds ewry tajm . 
  from a pov of slavic speaker - i do n't see much difference between `` der/die/das / den/der/dem '' and `` the '' . 
  much better spelling system for english . 
  we have this too . 
  ladybug is biedronka , but some people call them `` bo\u017ca kr\u00f3wka '' = ` god 's little cow ' . 
  i doubt sapkowski thought about google when he invented that word in late eighties , but i guess the reasoning looked similar . 
  never remember which is which . 
   here is even a welsh myth about a forest that rose up to fight a great battle . 
  same myth inspired the forest in hamlet ?
