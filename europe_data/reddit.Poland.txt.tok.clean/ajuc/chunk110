  destroying constutitional court and independence of all courts from executive power is going to bite poland in the ass for decades . 
  they do n't care . 
  so - it does n't matter if they are evil , mad , or just extremely cynical ( after us - even flood is ok ) . 
  the problem they create is real . 
  hydrogen-powered train is electricity-powered train where hydrogen is storage method . 
  why not just use electric trains and lines that hang over the rails ? 
  if you already build the rails invest a few percent more and add the wires . 
  they barely got majority without coallition , and they already fuck with constitution and high court . 
   as far as i am aware , evolution is not a de fide dogma of the catholic church but neither is it condemned . 
  that ; s what i meant by `` most probably true '' . 
  no scientific ( testable ) theory can exclude untestable assumptions  and the assumptions are carefuly made untestable , if they were n't - church would have huge problem when science advanced enough . 
   there 's something disturbing about just killing off an entire species because a neighboring country has `` enough of them '' it 's stupid anyway , it 's like saying `` this bottom part of glass can be emptied , because there 's enough water in the top half of the glass . '', 
  and expecting the bottom half to remain empty . 
  copernicus was catholic priest too , even a bishop . 
  but he had to hide his discovery and only published it shortly before his death out of fear of church reaction . 
  so - the fact that a scientists was catholic does n't mean anything in itself . 
  and i would like a source about this `` largest in the world '' observatory . 
  i think you have old data . 
  catholic church official position is that god created universe and eventually people , but not literaly how it happened in bible , and that details are to be discovered by science . 
  for example catholic church accepts that evolution is most probably right . 
  i do n't particulary like them for other reasons ( teachings about sex , abortion , etc ) , but creationism is not a problem here . 
   idiots who support science , tell me more ? 
  sprz = 3 sounds ( spsh + - ) . 
  czk = 2 sounds ( chk ) . 
  szcz = 2 sounds ( shch ) . 
  it 's not that much , honestly . 
  english has 3 consonants in a row as well - ngl in `` english '' for example , or spr in spring . 
  oh please , at most it 's szcz ( 2 sounds ) . 
  other slavic languages have much less vovels than polish . 
  fun fact - portugal is the most polish-sounding non-slavic language . 
  you have lots of sz and \u0105 / \u0119 sounds . 
  what does it even have to do with anything ? 
  the problem is that x force y to adhere to x beliefs at cost of y life . 
  yes !, 
  they can have ridiculus beliefs . 
  and we can laugh at them . 
  when they try to enforce them on others , at the cost of other 's lives - it becomes serious . 
  this kind of criticism is exactly what 's needed for nothing to change . 
  so no , we should n't `` stop right here '' . 
   fertility rate in poland is among the lowest in the world anyway , so what 's the problem ? 
  forcing women to commit suicide by not aborting their health-threathening pregnancies . 
  this is article on niezale\u017cna.pl . 
  they mean opposition obviously , nevermind if it happened or not . 
  witchers used full plate armour and katanas and vesemir was a druid  i do n't think it is canon . 
  she 's overly vindicative ( look at the killing trip after she met with geralt by the end of the books ) , and often act very irrationaly ( leaving the mage school to see geralt for example ) . 
  she easily ignores needs of others when she 's angry ( murdering innocent people when she was with rats ) . 
  she 's also not 100 % grown up emotionally yet . 
  but yeah , she 's far too powerful to be the main character . 
  cdpr would need to nerf her somehow . 
  that 's the main error . 
  russia is obviously mordor . 
  never heard it used that way . 
  `` przepi\u0107 kogo\u015b '' would be `` to outdrink someone '' . 
  `` przepi\u0107 co\u015b '' would be `` to drink so much you lose x '' . 
  for example `` przepi\u0142em m\u00f3j dom '' means `` i drank away my house '' ( sold it and spent all money on w\u00f3dka ) . 
  we mostly refered to pre-drinking as `` rozgrzewka '' ( warming up training ) . 
  if you want to create a verb for pre-drinking it would be `` przedpi\u0107 '' more than `` przepi\u0107 '' . 
  `` prze - '' means `` over '' or `` through '' . 
  well , then it should be different color for russia . 
  ever wondered where the `` roma '' comes from in romania 's name ? 
  well , yuszczenko was poisoned by putin 's guy - yanukovych, 
  i was going along with your joke . 
  damn shame . 
  but what can you do . 
  politicians successfully persuaded poles ( * ) that muslims are here to destroy us . 
  any moment now . 
  ( * ) majority of poles , not all, 
  is friday stinkday in danish ? 
  also einstein was american scientist . 
  poniedzia\u0142ek is `` after sunday '' , or `` after not working '' , not `` after week '' . 
  as a pole living in poland i do n't care about obama , but i do care about poland . 
  so , stick this `` and in usa they lynch negros '' rethoric up your ass . 
  thanks . 
  may it be , that racists are n't actually rational ? 
  37.58 % maybe more now , because they introduced huge social spending programme . 
  do you per chance speak 5 decibels louder than anybody else in mexico ? 
   worked for farage and his show-man style . 
  also for pis . 
  and it seems to work for trump . 
  west as in eu+usa . 
  i 'm not aware if it 's on rise elsewhere too . 
   people did n't play up hatred and xenophobia http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/4/21/1398083384169/ukip-poster-26-million-pe-009.jpg do n't you think it fuels the fear ( phobia ) of foreigners ( xeno ) ? 
  how is unemlpoyed chav going to react to this one ? 
  they ( politicians ) are doing this on purpose , to gain the votes of people that ca n't manage on the labour market - to give them easy target to blame for their problems . 
  it 's easy way to win votes , and it causes xenophobia to be perceived as more acceptable . 
  that 's what i have problems with . 
  it happens in my country as well , in different context ( muslim migrants destroying our culture is the current paranoia ) , but the effect is similar - all foreigners have problems because of that , and the politicians use that fear to win against their competitors . 
  that 's one thing that won pis elections . 
  once you persuade people to hate others it 's very hard to unpersuade them . 
  it 's gold in political terms - anybody who disagrees wo n't be able to take your voters from you . 
  and who agrees - will be perceived as copying you . 
  great strategy . 
  just fucked up people 's lives but who cares . 
   i could also spend all day posting news stories of racist attacks in poland , although they are probably not even reported as such . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51xrjl/professor_of_uw_assaulted_in_warsaw_because_he/?st=it2qn1en&amp;sh=042e9209 of course they are reported , as they should be . 
  it 's evil no matter where it happens . 
  there 's less of these in poland , in my opinion mostly because there 's much less foreigners in poland . 
  the funny thing is - in poland it would look similar if there 's enough space ( very few people waiting for a long train/tram ) . 
  so the ideal distance is roughly the same . 
  but it almost never happens because there 's much more people and not enough space so people shrink the space proportionally .
