  seems finns do n't do that , no matter how ridiculus it gets , 
  what about them ? 
  where do i say anything about them ? 
  i thought it 's obvious that  presenting bigots as reasonable people , and playing up hatred and xenophoby was a thing politicians and media supporting brexit did . 
  then again , maybe i 'm wrong . 
  are you suggesting brexit voters did these things as well ? 
  we have this funny proverb in poland : `` hit the table , and the scissors will announce themselves '' . 
  we 're talking europe . 
  or even `` the west '' . 
  but in this article we 're talking uk . 
  where am i generalising sweepingly ? 
  nah , current mainstream polish position is very hypocritical about that . 
  basically : `` hey english people , you 're supposed to hate muslims not us white europeans '' .

  poland : - oj siadaj , siadaj ( wedding song ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3quy3pdjma - zb\u00f3jnicki ( popular highlanders ' dance with lyrics about bandits ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgnz7htd8a4 - hej , soko\u0142y ( the drinking song in poland and ukraine , it 's about cossack soldier leaving his girl and country ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqvqmrmlh14, 
  it turns out presenting bigots as reasonable people , and playing up hatred and xenophoby has some bad consequences . 
  who knew . 
  `` i may be jailed for murdering people because of their ethnicity , but at least nobody will call me racist '' , 
  because some politicians build careers on persuading people they should hate them . 
  some would do that anyway , but now they think it 's ok . 
  same things happens in poland , it 's profitable to play with hatred and xenophoby . 
  kaczy\u0144ski is doing exactly the same thing with \u017bo\u0142nierze wykl\u0119ci , that ukraine is doing with upa and bandera . 
  in both cases there were ok people and heroes , and mass-murderers of civilians . 
  in case of \u017bo\u0142nierze wykl\u0119ci the proportions of heroes to the murderers were significantly higher than in case of upa , but it 's still true that \u017bo\u0142nierze wykl\u0119ci murdered whole villages of civilians in several cases . 
  because the villagers supported the wrong partisans for example . 
  or because other partisans murdered other village earlier . 
  there were also units like brygada \u015awi\u0119tokrzyska , which worked together with german nazi army , including ss , near the end of ww2 . 
  and now we 're celebrating them en masse , together with nationalists like onr . 
  onr is invited , but opposition parties are n't . 
  and when you 're participating - you can be thrown out by onr hools , and it 's `` your damn fault '' . 
  and you 're a traitor and not a true pole if you do n't like that . 
  fuck this shit . 
  how unsurprised i am . 
  xenophoby investment are high last few years . 
  a tram is n't such place . 
  our equivalent of brexiters are in power right now , whet do you expect ? 
  you wo n't get beaten up or called names , well , at least you would n't so far . 
  the general hate level is rising as showcased by the article we 're commenting on . 
  but if you ask people what is the biggest problem - like 30 % would answer `` poland is owned by jews and germans '' . 
  1 vs how many - 100 ? 
  now compare how often people speak german in poland vs polish in uk . 
  then calculate probability . 
  then we can speak if it 's often or not , 
  most of `` patriotic hools '' ( yes , it 's now a demographic category ) do n't mind hitler , and agree with most of his political decisions ( certainly about the jews ) , but think that germany now is leftist and is conspiring with jews to destroy poland , therefore if you work for german media in poland you are traitor for example . 
  people explaining this with cultural traumas are simply wrong . 
  20 years ago nobody cared about ww2 and germany . 
  now it 's fashionable . 
  and current government made it fashionable to think germany is secretly destroying poland . 
  specifically to portrait their political enemies as traitors . 
  and they benefit from that paranoia . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  same as the news about poles attacked in uk for speaking polish , right ? 
  i do n't mean sun as `` not cloudy '' . 
  i mean sun as `` not night '' . 
  either very good trolling or very bad research  i think i understand how kazakchstan sportsmen felt when the orchestra played borat anthem when they won sth . 
  it 's stupid as hell . 
  poland already accepted over hundred tousand chechen refuges in last 25 years . 
  nothing bad happened . 
  now a few tousand and it 's scary !!!, 
  that 's media-fueled paranoia for you . 
  it means that 1 person would change the result by 50 % . 
  so it 's not statisticaly significant result . 
  because it sucks to be `` a real man '' in modern world . 
  and people are still trying . 
  the winters with snow etc are n't so bad . 
  but the long autumns when you go to work and it 's dark and return and it 's dark again , and the whole day you do n't see sun - it 's harsh . 
   that is caused by a sort of cover-up of family members who want the deceased to be burried with a catholic ritual on a catholic cemetry . 
  both would be impossible if the official cause of death is suicide . 
  it 's not true anymore ( at least since 70s ) . 
  catholic church assumes people had psychological problems so they were n't at fault for the suicide , so they can have the burial . 
  but yeah , many believers do n't know this so they can misreport the death cause . 
  russian cheese is flammable  http://www.meganewsweb.com/en/news/breaking-news-shokirujuschee-video-v-rossii-prodajut-legkovosplamenjajuschijsja-tvorog, 
  last 10 years the winners are the same , in the same order : russia , china , poland , 
  but you need someone to pay you for it , 
  both this stats and innovation stats are misleading . 
  innovation is measured differenty in different countries , in some countries there are economic benfits to be classified as innovation ( so people register ) , in others it does n't - so people do n't bother . 
  that 's one reason c&ee is so low on innovation in my opinion . 
  i worked on quite interesting stuff in polish company ( bpm system for huge warehouses with graphical interface for business processes , features like speech recognision and path optimisation for the warehouse workers ) , and we were n't registered as innovation because there was no financial incentives . 
  on the other hand in some places people register a new cosmeticaly different design for a table as innovation because it pays to do so ( grants , tax cuts , whatever ) . 
  these hackerrank stats are also misleading because many begginers from outside anglosphere do n't know english well enough to participate . 
  and once they learn english they are n't begginers any more . 
  and then there 's the fact that programming tests are n't directly translatable to real-world performance ( different skillset see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51ep9p/which_country_would_win_in_the_programming/d7bhgt3?st=isrkxqhn&amp;sh=3169c902 ) . 
  but the correlation is still there , so it is still indicative of places with lots of good programmers . 
  this is interesting , and circlejerkable ( poland top 3  ) , but it 's not like these kinds of tasks always translate to everyday programming job . 
  it 's like sprinting ( a few hundred lines of code , well defined problem , math and algorithms-heavy tasks ) vs everyday programming marathon ( mostly a problem of tracking millions of lines of boring code that does n't do anything mathy or clever ) . 
  i know some people that were very good at the first , and still bad at `` real jobs '' because they lacked attention to details or could n't focus on millions of lines of code for months before getting results . 
  they would be probably very food computer science academics on the other hand ( but there 's not much jobs for them ) . 
  but yeah , poland strong !, 
   pivo same as in polish ( `` piwo '' , but polish `` w '' is pronounced `` v '' ) . 
  and yeah it literally means `` thing you drink '' . 
  like `` pieczywo '' ( baked goods ) means `` thing you bake '' . 
  looking at all examples of federalization vs self-government i know - the relatively poorer parts of bigger entities do better when they are independent . 
  see northern ireland ( part of uk ) vs republic of ireland . 
  eastern germany vs poland ( despite absurd money transfers to eastern germany ) . 
  or even inside poland - mazowieckie region outside of warszawa is less wealthy and has strikingly higher unemployement than even lubelskie region . 
  it 's better to be self-governing than part of wealthy state in the long term . 
  of course the best is to have a cake and eat it too - that 's why i support loose european union , but do n't support use . 
  that 's why most small countries does n't want eu to become one country , like usa . 
  it would cement the inequalities forever . 
  borders and self-government help with catching up .
