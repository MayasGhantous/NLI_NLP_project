  poland has no territorial claims . 
  more about that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giedroyc_doctrine, 
  if you do n't have anything russia wants you have no influence . 
  russia wants the sanctions to stop . 
  if the sanctions stop - you have nothing russia wants again ( and the next time you threathen sanctions they know you 'll not keep them up too long ) . 
  it 's rational to keep the sanctions . 
  stop thinking in terms of boths sides giving sth and trusting each other like in personal relations . 
  think in terms of thugs exchanging drugs and money . 
  you do n't want to give the drugs and patiently wait for the other thugs to give you money when they feel like it . 
   if we trade and cooperate with russia we can have some influence . 
  worked out so well the last time , 
  and that 's bad because ? 
  russians are just regular people . 
  it 's russia that is evil . 
   it does n't look like they are achieving anything except escalating russian nationalism even higher . 
  ukraine still exists . 
  nobody new was invaded . 
  i 'd say it 's ok .  increased economic exchanges with the rest of the world is the best way to make a country behave as they have much more to lose than if they are effectively closed off that was the ilussion people had before ww2 . 
  it was also the illusion germany had about russia before georgia and ukraine invasions . 
  it 's wrong . 
  always = 100 years  good to know . 
  fun fact - the total support of pis and kukiz was 46 % . 
  also called `` suicide by putin criticizm '' . 
  it 's partially because r&d spending is underreported , because it does n't give you any benefits , so why bother filling the papers . 
  but yeah - we need more of it . 
  as old saying goes : `` why are you poor ? 
  cause you 're stupid . 
  why are you stupid ? 
  cause you 're poor . '', 
  you poles and your politicians blackmailed by coal miners ' trade unions . 
  that was the reson we have n't got the \u017barnowiec nuclear plant in 80s/90s . 
  now most people are for nuclear plants , but it takes time to actually build one . 
  red flags are already banned . 
  like usual `` do as i say not as i do '' . 
  look up the taxes and tarrifs in usa when it had the highest growth - you will be surprised . 
  deal . 
  they will migrate anyway . 
  yes i know history , just did n't knew you were n't balts by ethnicity . 
  does n't count , he has his heels in air . 
  til . 
  why are they called a baltic country , then ? 
  they are balts actually , not slavs . 
  but i 'd give them honorary membership for that feat . 
   if you actually think that people in russia would be willing to surrender the freedoms they got after ussr fell for `` empire building '' is n't this exactly what they did thanks to putin ? 
  ` crimea is ours ' etc , while the food prices are growing , the borders are closed , and the sanctions pile up . 
  the laws are also increasingly restrictive , including forbidding ngos with foreign support , media laws , public gatherings etc. 
  first - it 's not a lie . 
  he did said it , he did invaded ukraine . 
  second - even without it there 's still huge resenment and desire to form ussr-like empire in russia . 
  why would my argument fall ? 
  i do n't . 
  i think people arguing that commonwealth ( or 2nd rp for that matter ) was saint and should be recreated as it were are idiots . 
  and there are some of them , but it 's still small minority in poland . 
  as for communist poland there are almost no such people , and why would they exist - communist poland was created and existed aginst the will of most of poles . 
   `` please improve conditions but do n't increase the cost to us . '', 
  got ta love corporate double speak . 
  nah , it 's entirely possible . 
  just automate this and fire the underpaid workers . 
   not allowed to operate outside of the eu agreed . 
  except when there 's agreement in referendum in all 28 states independently . 
   every top-level decision is agreed by the 28 military commanders no . 
  defence must be triggered automaticaly . 
  otherways let 's say russia does hybrid war on let 's say estonia and everybody look the other way . 
  do n't you think putin clearly meant at least for ukraine and belarus to be in russian sphere of inluence ? 
  if it says collapse of empire was a catastrophe , and it does things to recreate the empire - how is it not imperialism ? 
   it had it worse because it had the biggest fields , highest dependency on them for national supply you 're saying they were starving more than others ( 80 % of victims were ukrainian ) , because they produced most of the food ? 
  i would expect them to starve the least . 
  maybe someone took their food so that others wo n't starve ? 
   and geographically least ability for the peasants to flee elsewhere ( due to being the one with biggest fields and in the middle of the crop-producing region , while others were on the edges ) . 
  soviets banned the emigration from most of the ukrainian ssr at that time . 
  it was n't `` geographic '' restrictions , but administrative ones . 
  and you of course skipped over the forced migrations because it 's hard to explain them  btw soviets did `` national operations '' where they executed or expelled hundreds of tousands of people just because of their ethnicity . 
  how do you explain that ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_%281937%e2%80%9338%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nkvd_order_no._00439 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_koreans_in_the_soviet_union https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_operation_of_nkvd  ukraine did n't have it worse `` because racism '' of course not . 
  they had it worse because they were inconvenient . 
  what does it change ? 
  russians were the `` main '' ethnicity ussr was built on , so they had to be convenient , the rest had less luck . 
   `` soviet russia '' state was called soviet russia just few years before . 
  and anyway name does n't matter . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth was called `` republic of both nations '' , yet poles decided more than lithuanians . 
  and see holy roman empire   and as a good christian you clearly have concept of original sin drilled into you . 
   when you are in a state that has more arable land than anyone and people had to ration food on state level for years , yes you would think that economy was the biggest problem to trump all . 
  economy was the problem for the people inside . 
  their totalitarism , expansionism and imperialism were problems for them and for half of the world . 
   by your logic , should n't you be comparing russians wanting to recreate ussr to poles wanting to recreate commonwealth ? 
  of course . 
  but , we were takling about responsibility for things that communist poland did , not commonwealth . 
  you wo n't find 5 % of poles that want to recreate communist poland . 
  you will find 50 % of russians that want to recreate ussr no problem . 
  that 's the difference . 
  polish people are assholes and angels . 
  just like everybody else . 
  but polish people had no influence over that decision . 
  in fact since yalta conference polish people had no influence on any political decision till 1980 . 
  and then again till 1989 . 
  we were made to give up lots of land , migrate , decline participation in marshall plan , decline the ww2 reperations , give up plutonium mines in our mountains in exchange for nothing , participate in czechoslovakia invasion , and then `` invade ourselves '' in martial law . 
  all the time most of population was against the government , and there were no elections where the regime would have won . 
  there was armed resistance betwen 1944 and 1963 , and mass protests in 1956 , 1968 , 1970 , 1980 . 
  stopped by government using violence and killing a few peopel each time . 
  in martial law it was more like a few hundred - few tousand ( depengin how you count ) .
