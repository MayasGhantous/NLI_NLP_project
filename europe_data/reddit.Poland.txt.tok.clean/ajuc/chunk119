  you can be a hobbit when you live in shire . 
  when you 're between sauron and saruman it 's not exactly wise . 
  central business district i guess . 
  impossible in practice , therefore bad . 
  just like communism , anarchism , etc. 
  i like eu and think it 's been a huge net positive force in last decades , and i 'd like to see some more things solved on eu level ( common army , energy policy , maybe even social system ) , but nowhere near the use point , that just would n't fly . 
  and ? 
  i was there today and it 's bullshit . 
  there are all ages , mostly people ~ 35 . 
   our law was always behind the western one no it was n't `` always '' . 
  in fact our laws were quite progressive at the time . 
  for one example - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_confederation but yeah , homosexuality was just an ommision . 
  it 's not like they would welcome a gay pride parade , 
  pentagram is a kind of a star , and red army had a star on their banner . 
  eu flag has stars as well . 
  it 's obvious at this point that stars are satanist , leftist , communist symbols , and you should n't look at them . 
  and i did n't even mentioned jews . 
  is watching stars legal ? 
  no , not anymore . 
  poles abroad ( cumulated ) : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/b4/7b/bf/z12549044q,liczba-polskich-emigrantow-w-tysiacach.jpg unemployment in poland ( gus stats are calculated differentyl that 's why they are few percentage points higher ) : http://static1.money.pl/i/h/173/art377005.png yes , the emigration significantly contributed in 2002-2007 but since then the net migration to/from poland is roughly 0 , and yet the unemployement falls . 
  the `` polish '' and `` ex-german '' parts are still visible today on that stat . 
  percentage of kids born outside of marriage : http://x0.cdn02.imgwykop.pl/c0834752/01alabm_go62lag2lvyuxi7o39ybemifnawnand8,wat.jpg?author=cos_ciekawego&amp;auth=5bfac12495369371870acb4097404873, 
  http://jajco.pl/pic/1380738810-e_ocbl.jpg also you hear `` kurwa '' . 
  i do n't think the `` not apologising '' part is a priority . 
  let 's focus on the `` not invading others '' part first . 
  and maybe the `` not murdering journalists and opposition '' part . 
  proxy war implies 2 powers fighting on some other country territory , using mainly soldiers from other countries . 
  here 1 country - ukraine - uses its own soldiers and the other uses mainly volunters and soldiers from its own country . 
  and they are fighting in the first country territory . 
  hybrid war is more accurate description . 
  and public ridicule is one way to force them to cancel these laws . 
  rota is so `` in your face , germans !, 
  '' , though . 
  mazurek is much more universal . 
  hate speech ? 
  the whole point of unmanaged forests is not to do that . 
  ecologists ( including reputable people , that publish in nature - see previous articles on that subject ) wanted to make the rest of the forest `` unmanaged '' as well , and it was relatively untouched for many years now . 
  they argue unmanaged forests are very important for many endangered species , especially insects , because dead trees are where they live . 
  there were even tries to make the whole polish side of bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest into national park , but some people living there protested . 
  as for `` diseases that could kill the forest '' - these diseases only work on some species of trees . 
  the rest of the forest survive ( and singular trees hidden among other species often do - too ) . 
  that is how natural forests work . 
  it 's only modern monoculture `` productive '' forests that are very suspectible to diseases . 
  kinda pompous . 
  do i go to jail now ? 
  i 'm from lublin , have family near w\u0142odawa . 
  never seen it ( but heard about it , as that thing that russians do ) . 
  tapestries were universal , it was n't a polish thing . 
  using carpets instead seems to be russian-specific . 
  but pakistan had n't nuked anybody . 
  we do n't . 
  but - as funny as this sounds - we had space program once ( decades from working icbms point , but it had some successes - for example echieving 100 km with a soudning rocket - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meteor_%28rocket%29 ) . 
  it was cancelled because soviets did n't liked it ( surprise surprise ) . 
  this year polish space agency ( as funny as this sounds ) - is supposed to launch bursztyn - a prototype of another polish rocket http://www.defence24.com/267766,polish-amber-rocket-in-space that will eventually be able to reach space . 
  but it 's also long shot from that to icbms and i doubt we 're even working on that . 
  so no - no polish icbms in near future . 
   poland has enough high quality fuel to build dozen of bombs . 
  * had . 
  it was pita to store it , we did n't used it anyway , so we signed a treaty with usa and russia to dispose of most of it and switched the maria experimental reactor to less enriched fuel . 
  more : http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2010/03/26/poland-finds-nuke-material-hidden-behind-sofa/ my favorite quote : `` polish prime minister donald tusk said thursday that he would n't agree to give up the nuclear bombs that poland does n't have , `` partly '' because it does n't have them . '', 
   the thing is it never wanted them in the first place during communism gierek government tried to build polish neutron bomb . 
  they were exploring interesting designes initiated with high-powered lasers . 
  the guy responsible for the program ( gen. kaliski ) died in a car accident . 
  the program was cancelled shortly after . 
  i was sarcastic as well  i used their real arguments which i find very funny . 
  much easier to clean the windows when they open inwards . 
  the tornados that hit our region do n't usually destroy concrete houses . 
  at most they will destroy the roof . 
  asia is the new america . 
  america is the new europe . 
  europe is the new asia . 
  in my city recently they build a huge shopping mall in a place where there was a lake for centuries  there is a small underground river nearby as well . 
  they even have made underground parking . 
  http://www.biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/content/21439/100.10%201000.jpg http://d.webgenerator24.pl/k/r//o8/xu/cv9two0g4s448wcc4swkscwcsss/tarasy-3.600.jpg most people thought they will fail , and they have to pump out water constantly , but it seems to be ok . 
  it 's more complicated - young people in poland are overwhelmingly for marijuana legalization . 
  they use contraceptives . 
  like 90 % of them . 
  they are mostly for abortion legalization , but it 's less clear cut . 
  and they were mostly for lgbt rights or at least they were a few years - it seems to change recently . 
  now there 's `` new conservative '' wave and many young poles argue for catholic legislation for cultural reasons , even if they do n't believe and use contraceptives , etc. 
  it 's weird , i do n't understand their generation ( and i 'm just 30 ) . 
  pis got 37 % of 50 % of the eligible voters . 
  they won mostly because liberal voters were disappointed with the previous government that ruled for 2 terms . 
  people protesting a government choosen in valid elections are obviously antidemocratic . 
  why are you all so bend on the dictature , people ? 
  and if they protest we will say they are communists and support po . 
   the difference is that nobody takes it sertiously on the contrary - it is taken completely seriously by polish public media since a few months . 
  see all that propaganda about communists removed from the government . 
   many of these onr types are just thugs and criminals , as i 've said , not much different than antifa , but can you honestly call mw or bosak a `` nazi '' ? 
  i do n't know much about them . 
  but i will call marian kowalski a neonazi , no problem . 
  i 've been to anti-acta protest in lublin , and he and his thugs were there as well ( btw protesting same thing as onr feels weird ) - first thing they did was starting a fight with `` communists '' - by which they meant the anarchists that also protested acta . 
  some erasmus students from spain/mexic were there - they tried to beat them up as well . 
  few months before they also attacked `` leftist '' students ' club in lublin - tektura . 
  destroyed some property and beat up some students for disliking their ideology . 
  they organise marches with torches titled ( i kid you not ) `` jutro nale\u017cy do nas '' ( tommorow belongs to me - funny guys , with their hidden references , are n't they ? ) . 
  they use rad\u0142o , ss , white power , and swastika symbols ( they usually do n't show swastikas on banners but many of them had them on their clothes on that protest ) . 
  they are neonazis , plain and simple . 
  was that ever in question ? 
  if they supplied them illegaly - yes , obviously .
