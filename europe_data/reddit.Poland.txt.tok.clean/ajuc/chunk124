  recently a letter surfaced where pis politicians send to tvp ( polish public tv ) list of opposition members they are not allowed to invite to tv . 
  they even invited one of these guys already and had to cancel the debate . 
  this is level of stupidity and hipocrisy we 're talking about . 
  prussia was keeping army in it 's partition of poland because in 1830 russian partition had uprising , maybe that 's what he meant . 
   values and customs why the `` ethnic '' part , then ? 
  would n't it be better to call it culturocentrism if all you care about is culture ? 
  but it 's not all you care about , and that 's the problem . 
  do you realize nationalism and patriotism is not the same thing ? 
  in 1830 poland had uprising . 
  so it did controlled its borders . 
  uprising was in russian partition . 
  that 's mostly because of currency exchange rates , these can change at any moment ( though now because of pis they probably wo n't ) . 
  ppp is what matters for living standards anyway , and there we have much higher growth than eu or usa , in fact the highest grow in eu in that period . 
   nationalism drove the cause of independence . 
  patriotism did . 
  poland was multiculti then , and there were quite a lot polish citizens that fought for poland despite non-polish background . 
  nationalism is one of the reason it failed . 
  in usd . 
  in eur it increased from 9600 to 11 200 . 
  same source . 
  and the one that actually matters ( purchasing power parity ) increased even more . 
  keep trying , 
  minimal wage in poland 1st jan 2008 ( shortly after tusk took power ) - 313 eur . 
  minimal wage in poland 1st jan 2016 ( shortly after his part lost power ) - 433 eur . 
  that 's 38 % growth , much more than inflation . 
  may i remind you that there was economic crisis going on . 
  poland is nothing like usa when it comes to social policies and economy . 
  inequalities are quite small ( around eu average ) . 
  the problem in poland is n't the division of money , but the general lack of money .

  some names maybe ? 
  non-existant countries have names too . 
   too little is worse no . 
  show me one country ruined by too little ethnocentrism , and i 'll show you ten ruined by too much . 
  hell , even poland was ruined by too much ethnocentrism ~ 70 years ago . 
  and i do n't only mean germany - our very own endecja contributed by betraying ukraine and belarus in riga treaty in 1921 ( which allowed ussr to invade us in 17th september 1939 ) , and then suporting exploitation of ukrainians in wo\u0142y\u0144 ( which was one of the excuses for wo\u0142y\u0144 massacre of polish civilians by ukrainians ) . 
  read about the riga treaty especially - it 's a great showcase for why selfish nationalist policy is dumb . 
   due to their military setbacks , the soviet delegation offered poland substantial territorial concessions in the contested border areas . 
  however , to many observers , it looked like the polish side was conducting the riga talks as if poland had lost the war . 
  the polish delegation was dominated by members of the national democrat movement , who were pi\u0142sudski 's political opponents . 
  [ 5 ] the national democrats did not want non-polish minorities in the reborn polish state to constitute more than one third of the overall population , and were therefore prepared to accept a polish-soviet border which was substantially to the west of what was being offered by the soviet side , even though this would leave hundreds of thousands of people who were ethnically polish on the soviet side of the border . 
  not only we betrayed our allies belarus and ukraine and did n't created independen ukrainian and belarusian states - we refused to take their territories from soviet russia because endecja were pussies . 
  few years later millions of them died in hlodomor , and hundreds of tousands of polish citizens of soviet russia ( mostly living in these lands ) died in nkvd anti-polish operation . 
  great job endecja . 
  and of course no buffer staes between poland and soviet union meant that in 1939 ussr just invaded us with hitler , making the whole defense of poland pointless and killing further 1/6th of the remaining polish population . 
  if any country in the world should understand why nationalism ( so nicely hidden behind ethnocentrism in your post ) is evil - then it 's poland . 
  and many people here forgot and repeat all the mistakes ... 
  i personaly participated in protests that achieved their goals ( anti-acta ) . 
  was n't even that big protests ( 500-5000 people ) , but they were in almost every city in poland . 
  my father participated in protests that achieved their goals ( solidarity in poland ) . 
  you 're wrong . 
  dying of polonium poisoning or random bullet is very helpful for political career . 
  what would happen if he died . 
  more sanctions ? 
  more protests ? 
  nato invasion ? 
   i do n't know why guys like him even bother . 
  because they are patriots ? 
  do you really believe this , or are you paid to write this ? 
  if trump was arrested in a protest in 2016 i 'm pretty sure it would be covered by media . 
  they do n't believe their country can be fixed , so they settle on improving its pr . 
  many also think every country is exactly as shitty , and it 's just media manipulation presenting theirs as worse . 
  actual quote : `` i would like to make no threat today in this interview , but i would like to see the rule of law respected throughout europe , as we expect it should be '', 
  if denmark looks like a penis to you look at sweden + finland , 
  you 're supposed to receive communion if you 're without `` heavy '' sins , and if you have `` heavy '' sin you are supposed to go to the confession . 
  of course many people do n't do that . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's actually pretty funny . 
  36 % of poles believe we go to heaven , purgatory or hell after death , but 90 % + declare themselves catholics  http://www.newsweek.pl/polska/wiara-w-boga-ilu-polakow-wierzy-w-boga,artykuly,358195,1.html and around 39.8 % go to church regularly . 
  and 17,0 % participate in communion regularly . 
  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominicantes_i_communicantes_w_polsce is n't it funny how catholics think they own the country despite being in minority ( the ones that actually do what they preach at least ) , 
   who does this ? 
  polish education system ( poland the christ of nations , for yours and ours freedom , uprisings were patriotic act , and the generals trying to prevent mass suicide that were killed by military students were traitors , 1920 was a defensive war started by kiev expedition  , zaolzie was ours and we got it independently of hitler . 
  belarus and ukraine were our allies in 1920 but we did n't betrayed them when we divided them together with soviets , but great britain and france betrayed us when they did even though they have n't even got a piece of our lands . 
  sanacja was ok and pi\u0142sudski was a hero despite the fact that it was very corrupt and incompetent government created by a violent coup , and despite the fact it opressed opposition . 
  but \u0141ukaszenko is an evil dictator . 
  \u017beligowski was a great pole , but russian hybrid war in crimea is evil . 
  lw\u00f3w was a great polish city of culture and art but pogroms there were caused by ukrainians . 
  dmowski was a great pole , so what if his endecja destroyed chances of polish-ukrainian alliance and their political campaign against wo\u0142y\u0144 experiment was one of the reasons that wo\u0142y\u0144 massacre even could happen . 
  poles were educated and tolerant during 2nd rp . 
  ukrainians were treated ok and wo\u0142y\u0144 happened out of nowhere . 
  mass deportations , nationalization of orthodox churches and expulsions of ukrainian farmers never happened . 
  [ 1 ] the way they teach history and polish culture in schools teaches simplified , false image of innocent poland , always a blameless victim of foreign conspiracies , and poles are either heroes dying for honour , or traitors . 
  it 's the reason we ca n't have good things in polish politics - because stabilization and reasonable policy is seen as a treason . 
  then there 's right-wing media labeling everybody who shows these less proud parts of our history as `` anti-polish '' and sugesting a conspiracy ( usually german ) behind this . 
  because why would you even speak about jedwabne if you 're a `` true pole '' , right ? 
  you 're harming polish reputation - it 's a treason !, 
  try to propagate the knowledge of crimes by '' \u017bo\u0142nierze wykl\u0119ci '' and you 'll understand what i mean . 
  if you 're lucky paw\u0142owicz or ziemkiewicz will call you a leftist or anti-polish . 
  if you 're less lucky you may end like https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomasz_pietrasiewicz from lublin - onr youth was throwing bricks with threats through his windows , and making posters about him being jewish ( not true , but even if - so what ? 
  ) , or that he 's a `` bolszewik '' . 
  as for `` people love to moan about poland '' - guess what , people moan everywhere  germans think they are the ones with socks and sandals . 
  russians have gopnik , british created a whole genre of humor based on intelligent self-depreciation . 
  it 's universal . 
  but the butthurt generated in big part of polish population is special ( i think mostly because of the taught victimhood ) - that 's why polandball is a thing . 
  because when you invert a german or british flag nobody cares , but when you invert a polish flag shit hits the fan . 
  [ 1 ] yes , it 's not so simple , and i 'm not claiming poland deserved what happened in ww2 - but we certainly had our share of shame , and discussing that is important . 
  also economic or religious opression does n't make genocide ok - but it 's important to know the context , and usually it 's hidden when it 's not showing poland to be the good guy . 
  mostly yes . 
  it helps that they fight with russia .
