  you really need special skills in mental gymnastics to turn this clusterfuck of polish diplomacy into a success . 
  yay , we isolated ourselves in eu . 
  like - literally nobody supports us . 
  great achievement . 
  it 's likely not even achieving that . 
  their hardcore supporters will vote them anyway , and the less loyal believers can sometimes see through the bullshit and constant narration changes ( wyszegrad 4 for the win / wyszegrad 4 are traitors/orban the great - orban the traitor/tusk has no power - tusk is responsible for brexit and refuges ) . 
  not really . 
  tusk returning on white horse from being 2-times eu council president just in time for polish presidential elections is stuff from kaczy\u0144ski nightmares . 
  it 's not . 
  presidents in europe have little power in general , it 's mostly about prime ministers . 
  i kinda want them to try #polexit . 
  the way they handled wo\u015ap and tusk we might end up with poland as eternal eu capital , 
  except poland , because kaczy\u0144ski is still salty about that one defeat 10 years ago . 
  britain is lucky to even got 1 referendum ( the 1975 one - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_in_the_united_kingdom#1975_european_communities_membership_referendum ) . 
  and now ( last year ) it wants another ? 
  dream on . 
  the hipocrisy of brexiters who are against scotland independence gets me every time . 
  it 's delicious . 
  today waszczykowski ( foreign ministry of poland ) said in one interview : `` tusk 's office has no real power in eu '' , and `` brexit and refuges crisis are tusk 's fault '' . 
  pis ( and waszczykowski especially ) contradicts itself all the time . 
  just 2.5 years more . 
  in case of democracy people who do n't believe in any of that bullshit are fucked too . 
  mostly because ( like me ) they voted parties that agree with their beliefs the closest , instead of voting the party that had a chance to stop pis . 
  i wo n't make that mistake again . 
  why ? 
  you do n't have to believe in everything party x says to vote them . 
  there 's only about 10 parties that have any chances to get to parliament , and millions of possible sets of beliefs . 
  it 's not an insignificant detail , because you try to portrait poles as concerned about too much refuges moving from poland to germany , which they are n't . 
  in fact the anti-immigration poles i know would be very happy if all refuges moved from poland to germany . 
  nah , not all their voters agree with 100 % of their propaganda . 
  some just want 500 + for example . 
  so you say if you define `` poles ... their country '' as eu , then there is no contradiction  i agree . 
  but why should i redefine words in such way ? 
  that 's what happens when one person rules the whole country and has no responsibility attached . 
  kaczy\u0144ski is n't even in the government , he just plays with his toys . 
  the sad thing is - like 20 % of poles believe that . 
   as for refugees from the middle east . 
  poles do n't want them in their country because they know that they will probably stay here forever compare to https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yauc1/poles_in_favour_of_strengthening_collaboration_in/dep6kgz/?st=j025r32c&amp;sh=09213b4c  over half of syrian refugees in poland left to germany already how do you expect us to keep them here ? 
  put them in jails ? 
  do you see the contradiction ? 
  meh , it 's ok now . 
  i lived on and off in warsaw and lublin for last few years , and while i much prefer lublin , warsaw is ok . 
  it 's just not a very touristy city ( except for huge museums ) . 
  btw well-renovated , and positioned commie blocks are a ok . https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7525/16140144392_890288d1b8_b.jpg the problem begins when they are built between historic buildings . 
  but in the same way any great building can be bad in the wrong context . 
  me neither tbh , that period was a clusterfuck , and is glossed over even in polish schools except for a few key events . 
  i read about it because there was a great book series `` boles\u0142aw chrobry '' by antoni go\u0142ubiew . 
  reads like game of thrones ( 100s of characters , pov switches between them every few pages ) , but most of the events and characters are real or at least probable . 
  you just have to overlook a dose of catholicism propaganda , but other than that it 's great . 
   how do you expect us to keep them here ? 
  put them in jails ? 
  one thing is how , another thing is `` do we want to '' . 
  most poles do n't , let 's be honest , even if it makes sense politically and strategically . 
  and the obvious solution would be to pay other countries to keep their refuges there if we do n't want them or ca n't keep them . 
  but try to win elections in poland with that proposal  the only way to win elections is to insist poland will only take from eu and wo n't give back anything , and to complain about how eu is abusing poland at the same time . 
  so that 's what politicians say . 
  polish people were more pro-choice regarding abortion in 1990 than now . 
  and more pro-lgbt . 
  and more pro-refuges . 
  in fact when there were russian-chechnyan wars in 90s most poles were highly pro-refuges and there were over 50 000 refuges from there over the years . 
  you do n't get much more muslim than chechnya , yet there were no instances of muslim terrorism in poland , ever . 
  in the meantime there was massive campaign against refuges ( mostly showing how stupid west is to invite muslims and how they are all terrorists and rapists ) . 
  there was a huge church offensive ( religion in the schools since 1st class , with opt-out that is quite inconvenient ) . 
  abortion debate was restarted every time government changed and it wanted to hide real problems , and each time church portrayed the poilticians who were pro-choice as devils , and each time the consensus moved towards `` no abortion at all '' . 
  there 's nothing constant , society is quite easy to manipulate over time . 
  i can easily imagine polxit in 10 years if the circumstances are `` right '' . 
  poland is n't more male-dominated than spain . 
  it takes time to move troops . 
  the troops that are in baltic states are not enough to repel attack from the troops russia has in kalingrad oblast and mainland russia near baltic states . 
  it 's not my conclusion , it was in nato report linked in this subreddit a few years ago . 
  you can bite the bullet and fix what 's wrong or suffer indefinitely . 
  it 's exactly as much related as ukraine or belarus . 
   and europe could easily win that war with the combined budget it has today . 
  russia invades baltic states . 
  a week later they are conquered . 
  russia threathens to use nukes on anybody that wants to defend them ( which would involve re-invading them from poland or sea ) . 
  what can nato/eu do to prevent that ? 
  also when a hospital goes bust - wo\u015ap is technically only renting the equipment , so it just moves it to a different hospital . 
  if it was owned by the hospital it would be sold to cover debts . 
  i 'd say the whole anti-wo\u015ap campaign in national media worked miracles , 
  because of the worldview of the guy behind this organisation . 
  he 's very liberal , his most famous saying is `` r\u00f3bta co chceta '' ( do what you want in youth slang ) . 
  owsiak is one of the last widely respected liberal celebrities in poland - a thing that church and pis ca n't stand . 
  hence the campaign of insults and accusations of various kinds . 
  hard to say , because it 's `` around year 1000 '' , and around that year there were 3 polish-german wars . 
  i guess it shows the territories that were fought over at the time ? 
  the map is inaccurate anyway , there 's much more detailed map ( in polish only - the red line is 1025 borders , the dark pink is 992 borders , the light pink is regions joined between 992 and 1925 , and the orange is temporarily joined and lost regions . 
  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/historia_polski_ ( do_1138 ) # / media/file : polska_992 _ - _ 1025.png, 
  would you protest if somebody painted a map with `` italian empire '' in 50 a.d. ? 
  that 's basically what this map is doing , 
   and why do men feel they need to be `` providers '' in the first place ? 
  that 's entirely cultural , aka : related to how they 're raised . 
  it 's not only men . 
  both sexes expect more of men . 
  you would have hard time finding men that dream of being vanity marriage partner , but you can find many such women , for one example . 
  much more women would n't marry unemployable guy than the other way around . 
  nobody will say you 're `` not a real women '' if you pursue a career , or stay at home to care for kids . 
  men have less options if they care for the society opinion . 
  you 're making it seem like it 's only the way the men are raised that 's the problem , when it 's not . 
  a straight guy that wants to have a family has to worry about being a provider for the family , even if he was n't raised that way , because most potential partners expect him to .
