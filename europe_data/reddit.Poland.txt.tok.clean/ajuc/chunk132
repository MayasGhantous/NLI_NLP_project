  no consquences whatsoever ... 
  i just hope they all go to jail after next elections . 
  otherways people will forget and in a decade it 'll all repeat again . 
   what would you think if a moscow based ngo started advocating for political change in poland if it advocated for a thing i agree with i would support it . 
  why is this even a question ? 
  are you against ban on smoking because hitler was the first to introduce it ? 
  when foreigner say 2 +2 = 4 is he wrong because he 's abroad ? 
  this boggles my mind . 
  by foreign you mean non-russian ? 
  what makes ngos from country other than russia less reliable than ngos from russia ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  that russian opposition ca n't care about ukraine ? 
  see the `` independent '' ( meaning financially connected to kaczy\u0144ski ) media take on homosexualism  http://wpolityce.pl/polityka/150751-homoseksualne-zagrozenia-ta-postepujaca-akceptacja-praw-homoseksualnych-dotyka-fundamentu-funkcjonowania-panstwa-i-spoleczenstwa apparently homosexualism makes countries fall and society degenerate ... 
  sorry but i prefer to quote wyborcza on these issues . 
   normally , only hardcore catholics are hostile to homosexuals . 
  http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,14043683,akceptacja_dla_homoseksualizmu_w_polsce_najnizsza.html?disableredirects=true 42 % of poles say homosexuals should be socially accepted . 
  46 % said it should not . 
  that was the worst result in eu . 
  and it 's actually worse than it was in 2007 . 
  let 's not sugarcoat this , because then it 'll never change . 
  btw it 's not `` just '' hardcore catholics . 
  according to church statistics ( dominicantes ) - 39 % of poles go to church regularly . 
  and 17 % take communion . 
  compare to 46 % . 
  i do n't like something so i complain about it . 
  what 's strange about that ? 
  should i only talk about the good things that happen in poland ? 
  then it would be warped image . 
  if you do hail hitler you 're deserving all the shitting , sorry but i 'm not sorry . 
  i 've had the misfortune to meet a few onr members and even was on one demonstration with them ( against acta ) . 
  they do hail-hitler , some wear ss t-shirts , many wear white power signs . 
  what would it take for you to recognize them as neonazi , if that 's not enough ? 
  btw - few years ago onr in lublin threathened 2 historians preserving jewish history of lublin . 
  the got bricks with swastikas thrown through windows , swastikas painted on their walls and car , people were distributing anti-jewish leaflets about them . 
  someone thrown firecrackers at their houses . 
  police and abw searched flats of 9 suspected members of onr in lublin , and funnily enough found ss insignias , nazie eagles , swastikas . 
  stop defending a lost cause . 
  there 's plenty of non-nazi right-wing movements i 'm sure , but onr is not one of them . 
  btw another example of onr from my city - they attacked `` leftist '' student 's club tektura and beat up some people becausethey were `` commies '' . 
  i 'm sure dmowski is proud . 
  it 's like -8 since december in lublin . 
  every weather deserves complaining . 
  without germans to fear lithuania would n't join union . 
  \u017b is always pronounced as \u0416 . rz is mostly pronounced the same as \u017c , except if it 's immediately after p , k , t ( maybe others i forgot about ) - then it 's pronounced almost exactly as `` sz '' ( depending how correct people speak ) . 
  also words with rz change differently than these with \u017c when it comes to cases etc ( kaza\u0107 - ka\u017ce , kara\u0107 - karze ) . 
  w versus w - i 've heard it 's because v was used instead of u sometimes ( especially on monuments ) , so people invented w to distinguish it from v/u . 
  but i 'm not sure . 
   you wo n't find nazis you will , no problem : https://perspektywa.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/onr.jpg http://m.ocdn.eu/_m/00e66ac0eab088f91074b8e87ac50787,62,37.jpg http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/nwe7mda_/56593b34ccd9356bb4cb2711c0742538.jpg, 
  for starters https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_ ( 1937 % e2 % 80 % 9338 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre but the universal hate is more towards the state than people . 
  inteligenzia mostly has the adam mickiewicz attitude ( tzar bad , russians ok ) . 
  another example - famous poet-singer jacek kaczmarski , describing himselfs as russophil-anticommunist . 
  of course there 's plenty of `` simple '' people that do hate russians unfortunately . 
  it 's funny because i remember from nineties that the biggest fireworks you could buy we called `` achtungs '' because htey had german signs , 
  is n't that obvious ? 
  poland : bachelor or higher ( m.a etc ) , and some higher trade studies ( i do n't know how to translate that - wy\u017csze studia zawodowe ) . 
  it 's anything 5 or higher from this standard : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_standard_classification_of_education#isced_2011_levels.2c_categories.2c_and_sub-categories, 
  you have sources in the image , http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=edat_lfse_12&amp;lang=en and i guess the reason for 30-34 is just that there 's no data on that page for other age ranges . 
  in case anybody 's interested in details .

  i 'm pretty sure killing people is considered bad by all cultures around the world , and were considered bad before enlightement , christianity , or even organised religion . 
   ( = the christian set of moral values as it developed in europe why bring christianity to `` do n't kill or imprison people '' ? 
  it 's not `` christian '' or `` european '' values . 
  it 's human values . 
  poland does have very good demographics right now ( baby boom of 80s is in the peak productive age ) . 
  it will have worse demographics in 10-20 years because there was no ' 00s baby boom . 
  1 million growing 1000 % for 5 years is greater than 20 bilion growing 1 % for 5 years . 
  percentages over longer periods are certainly meaningful . 
  yearly . 
  gdp measures change not level . 
  your interpretation was silly not the indicator . 
  it 's like saying 5-year kid is higher than his dad because average height growth was 5 % for kid and 0 % for his dad , and then concluding that the concept of `` height '' is stupid . 
  i wondered for a moment when did https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hel,_poland got airport and where did they put it . 
  hence the analogy . 
  if you do n't understand - o\u015bwi\u0119cim was n't part of poland when the death camp was operating there . 
  just like wroc\u0142aw was n't part of poland in 1933 . 
  would n't you expect victims to be more bashing the criminal than bystanders ? 
  russia causes 90 % of their problems , 
  what are they protecting it against ? 
  wroc\u0142aw in 1933 is as much `` poland 's progress '' as death camps were polish , 
  vahshchikovski you 're welcome . 
  weird , i feel less threatened . 
   the very poorest generally do n't have the means to leave . 
  oh come on . 
  you can fly to uk for 100 pln . 
  i have family in one of the poorest regions in poland ( small village surrounded by forest near w\u0142odawa ) , and like half the working-age population goes to netherlands every summer to work on farms . 
  there are agencies that pay for transport and food , and take a cut of your salary once you 're there . 
   it was all about `` fuck the police '' just a few years ago it still is . 
   how much truth is in that ? 
  it depends . 
  yes , relatively speaking educated people are less likely to emigrate , but some still go because of ( smaller , but still existing ) pay gap , or they are interested in doing something that is n't done in poland . 
  in industries where the pay gap is the smallest ( it , bpo , anything that can be outsourced basically ) there 's no real reason to go abroad . 
  and this changed with time - people now are much less likely to migrate than in 2005 . 
  also people working in public institutions have huge pay gap , nevermind the prestige . 
  so lots of doctors still go abroad for example . 
  such is the fate of stereotypes - poland b was in the west the whole time , 
  more people are employed in poland now than in 2004 . 
  in 2016 it was ~ 16\u00a0182\u00a0000 people . 
  in 2004 it was ~ 13\u00a0768\u00a0000 people .
