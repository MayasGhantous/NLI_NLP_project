  they were bad , i have n't voted them because of that , but they were much better than pis , and they had 8 years while pis fucked up more in 1 year ... also - have you been on these protests ? 
  averge is around 30 y.o. 
  or is that old ? 
  i 'm old already :( btw how is po , nowoczesna , psl , sld , razem all the same and pis somehow different ? 
  as long as you check them out with a vet for parasites before making food out of them . 
  the most sturdy ones can survive boiling for short periods of time . 
  and nobody wears such hats . 
  sikorski moved to po . 
  gilowska died in the meantime . 
  same with lech kaczy\u0144ski who was much more reasonable than his brother jaros\u0142aw . 
  a group of former pis members created a new party `` polska jest najwa\u017cniejsza '' which later collapsed . 
  i do n't remember others , but there were a lot of them . 
  also the region with the highest number of university students per city dweller in poland , the headquarters of poland ( and eastern europe ) biggest it company - asseco , and the `` aerospace engineering '' center in poland ( stalowa wola ) . 
  yes they voted mostly pis , but so did most of poland . 
  i hate it when people reduce millions of people to their favorite stereotype . 
  and i 'm not even from podkarpackie . 
  ps the photo could have been as easily made in warszawa in 1982 . 
  you apparently do , 
  as bad as it was 1939-1945 was worse . 
  my irony detector does n't work . 
  i heard people sincerly wishing to `` beat up these ub guys '' . 
  blocking the parliament happened many times in last 25 years . 
  you call the parliament guard ( whatever that is translated ) , and take that pm away gently . 
  you do n't stop other pms from voting . 
  look up lepper stunts if you do n't believe me . 
  additionaly - the first guy was n't even blocking the parliament . 
  he just stood there with a sheet of paper and asked on-topic question ( which he had the right to do , and even if not - the punishment for that is n't `` take away his voting rights '' . 
  and certainly not `` move to different room with only one party and vote without others '' . ) . 
  if you do n't see why this was complete overreaction and breech of law - sorry , but this discussion has no point . 
  it seems the further from the center you are - the more likely you are to limit democracy . 
  extreme far left and right are basically the same thing . 
  `` vote pis if you want 500 pln per month . 
  vote anything else if you 're godless communist ub leftist scum . '', 
  mostly they increase deficit - so take debts . 
  so they redistribute our future money to fuel consumption now . 
  and even with such boost gdp growth was around 2 % instead of predicted 3.5 % : /, 
  kindly fuck off . 
  thanks . 
  i was on the protests , and i much prefer when i can do that without battle training . 
  i am aware . 
  i did not vote them . 
  i even protested when they signed acta . 
  that being said - the leaks that were published did harmed polish interest ( especially the part where kulczyk and rostowski planned to take over central european gas market - it all felt apart shortly after publication of the leaks , and then kulczyk died during routine operation in switzerland ) . 
  but , whatever , their fault for allowing people to overhear them . 
  now , how this make it less bad for pis to abuse power ? 
  how is it that you know better than people why are they protesting ? 
  i was on the protest , and i 'm pretty sure i know why i was there . 
  last time they were much more tempered . 
  and media that were against them were overreporting anything they did to the point that people ignored it altogether . 
  `` boy crying wolf '' basically . 
  now the moderate parts of their party moved on , and only the 100 % faithful radicals remained . 
  and they are making so much chaos you have to be blind not to react . 
  today 's protests from around 13:00 . https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/770/31552514312_aa27dbf07f_h.jpg https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/368/31326431290_46383688b1_h.jpg https://c8.staticflickr.com/1/680/31583231551_02e378fade_h.jpg https://c8.staticflickr.com/1/513/31698889815_93f707397e_h.jpg https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5575/30857336794_bfa4ecf523_h.jpg all photos mine , and i give away the right to use them however you wish . 
  `` too many people protest therefore it 's not spontaneus '' worked great during solidarity times . 
  i 'm glad that such gems of propaganda are n't forgotten . 
  i guess pis has piotrowicz to remind them . 
  do you think it 's better if people ca n't see what parliament members does in parliament buiding , or do you think it 's better if they ca n't ? 
  consider that many `` affairs '' during previous terms were only uncovered thanks to the free media access to parliament . 
  why do you think government wants to stop this ? 
  why do you support them ? 
  it boggles my mind how brainwashed 30 % of poland is ... 
  they paid 500 pln every family with 2 kids ( and many families with 1 kid ) monthly . 
  they may say `` no elections ever '' , and still get 20 % support . 
  they have around 36 % right now . 
  when the hlodomor was happening in soviet union 's ukraine there were guys reporting on it , and guys denying it . 
  but because hitler and nazism was the biggest issue , and ussr was seen as the solution - people in the west ignored them . 
  when during ww2 polish resistance sent a guy to aushwitz and then smuggled his report to the west asking them to bomb death camps - the west ignored that disbeliving the reports as `` overexagerated '' . 
  roosevelt in private talk with polish politician in exile during ww2 said `` and what about horses ? '', 
  when the politician complained about the fate of jews under german occupation . 
  saying `` too much bad is said about something '' is the easiest way to dismiss some information as propaganda , especially when it is convenient ( as in case of todays right-wing people dismissing complaints about russia ) . 
  i 've heard it told that way : - you heard gomu\u0142ka will change the constitution ? 
  - change ? 
  why ? 
  it 's never been used yet . 
  poor john was unemployed for half a year , and he finally realized `` it 's all because of these gays and personal liberties '' . 
  that 's exactly what happened  in no way was it related to right and left wing parties fighting their ideological fights by blaming the other ideology for everything bad happening . 
  no problem . 
  from what i 've seen autotranslation between any pair of languages l , k is much worse if neither is english , than if one of them is english . 
  in nineties it was n't ? 
  i was in 0th class of primary school in 1989 and never had russian in school . 
  i autotranslate even slovak websites to english ( and not polish ) , simply because for any language autotranslation to english works much better than autotranslation to polish :(, 
  well , if you count all the people who learned it in school when it was mandatory . 
  half of them do n't remember a thing and never went further than learning the alphabet , but so what . 
  more like kurwa = blyat i think ? 
  kurwa can be used as any part of speech , in any place of any sentence : `` i kurwa go to him and say kurwa either you give back the money , kurwa , or i kurwa kill you . '', 
  from what i know about russian ( not much ) they do n't use suka like that ? 
  same in poland . 
  but it 's easy to learn cause it 's slavic , 
  polish is west-slavic group , russian is east-slavic group . 
  additionally both polish and russian are kinda weird among slavic languages ( russian has lots more mongol loan-words , and polish - italian , latin , german , french loan-words ) . 
  also russian has weird and complicated accent system , when in polish it 's always on penultimate syllable . 
  and polish has nasal vovels that mostly disappeared in other slavic languages . 
  i 'd say without learning russian is like 50 % intelligible , when slovak and ukrainian are like 80 % intelligible for polish speaker . 
  but yeah , almost any slavic language is easy for slavic speaker because the case system and pre/post-fixes are similar ( except bulgarian and macedonian , wtf is that ) . 
  i 've learnt cyrylic when i went on a trip to ukraine . 
  i was there 3 days . 
  it 's just substitution of one set of symbols to another ( and like half are the same as in latin , or the same as greek letters you know from math symbols ( sigma , pi , etc ) . 
  more like `` a step to keep the power for next 10 years blatantly disregarding laws , constitution , and lives of polish citizens '' . 
  the excuse that `` russians would come otherways . '', 
  is just an excuse , and not very good one ( russians say they had no such plans ) .
