  on one hand it does n't seem staged , there were too many , too realistic fuck-ups for that . 
  especially that there is personal antipathy between president duda and ministry of justice ziobro , and one of the laws gave many competences of duda to ziobro , and they did n't even asked president to look at that law before voting on it  on the other hand - duda still needs pis ( but a little less ) and pis still needs duda ( even more now ) . 
  anyway , it can only be good for poland . 
   the country was pretty much divisioned for about 20 years now not really . 
  politicians and voters of pis and po were on one side before 2005 . 
  yeah , it 's not like duda is now a saint . 
  but because of political reasons ( playing for divisions in pis ) i think he has to be supported by the opposition at least a little . 
  no , in polish practice they update the article numbers after sejm corrections , and then vote on that in senate . 
  but i read up on that , and in this case pis messed up - they updated the article numbers , but not the references between articles , so for example article 110 referenced article 107 , and after changing numeration it should refer article 111 , but it still refered 107 , which was about something totaly different now , so it made no sense  they voted that anyway , 
  president has usually ceremonial role , prime minister is much more important . 
  but in many places in the system president acts as a check on the government 's power - he can veto laws and then parliament has to vote with higher threshold to pass it anyway , or he can move them to constutitional tribunal to check for complying with constitution ( kinda no point now , because pis took that institution over ) . 
  president can also make a referendum on any subject he wants , and he approves candidates to many important positions in administration and courts ( but that was usually just a formality ) . 
   has the polish government blamed soros yet ? 
  never stopped blaming him since the elections . 
  why ? 
  there were polish flags as well . 
  poniatowski had very difficult situation , and did better than expected . 
  he was basically duda and catherine the great was kaczy\u0144ski , and yet poniatowski managed to prepare poles for inevitable occupation and even tried to reform poland . 
  the whole 18th century was balancing between `` give away the last remnants of independence to russia '' , and `` make an uprising and lose the independence without the masquerade of polish state '' . 
  that poniatowski managed to do the balancing for so long , and educate then-modern patriotic generations in the meantime - is a big deal . 
  yes , when parliamentary and presidential elections were staggered by 2 years - so that usually president was from a different party than government . 
  only after smole\u0144sk crash it changed , making both president and parliament be choosen close to each other , and our system is n't prepared for that ( in many places president acts as a check on government 's power ) . 
   young people support pis and that 's all that matters no longer  go on one of these protests , you 'll see for yourself . 
  even in usually pro-pis lublin there 's a lot of young people . 
  pis took it too far and lost the young people . 
  maybe if they did n't called protesters `` communists '' , it could have worked , but now people are fed up with their propaganda . 
  a protests from november 2015 were half this size and people argued if they are 50 000 or not . 
  pis said they were 15 000 then , 
  arguably they just changed the article numbers to make them uniform after corrections . 
  but still the law has errors , like in one articel it says they choose 3 judges , in other - 5 judges for some position . 
  no problem , they still want to pass this , 
  president is doing nothing , because he 's a puppet of kaczy\u0144ski . 
  people demand he vetoes the 3 laws that give power over courts to the governing party . 
  it 's very improbable that he will listen , because so far ( 2 years ) he signed everything pis gave him to sign . 
  people call him `` kaczy\u0144ski 's scribe '' . 
  edit : and i 'm wrong , he vetoed it . 
  sorry mr duda , 
  this is how government can keep doing whatever it wants . 
  it just needs to keep you divided . 
  that 's how symbols get their meanings . 
  that 's why i added `` no glass in between '' , 
  if it was in direct line of sight without any glass in between it works . 
  that 's why traveling on bike or on foot is so much better than everything else . 
  you actually have time to see something , and not just some points between which you jump . 
  bad reputation for protesters . 
   family lineage . 
  the communists and their lackeys keep selecting the judges . 
  show me that lineage then . 
  you insist it exists , it 's on you to provide the evidence . 
  bear in mind a third of judges were removed in 1989 . 
   that 's not up to you or me to decide . 
  how about letting it go to court and letting them decide ? 
  there was a case in court . 
  they decided it 's not illegal . 
  but then , you wo n't believe unless ziobro himself will be the judge , right ? 
  you seem to only read sources from one side . 
  it may look like pis is some new force out to reform poland . 
  sorry but that 's bullshit . 
  kaczy\u0144scy were in 4 governments since 1989 . 
  lech kaczy\u0144ski was a ministry of justice in early 2000s and designed the system we have today . 
  almost the whole pis voted for that system . 
  only a few pis mps abstained . 
  as lat as 2008 lech praised krs for independence . 
  current president duda ( also from pis ) , also said it was very good system , significantly better than eu average , before pis got to power . 
  pis mp that is leading the commision to reform courts - piotrowicz ( a communist persecutor that jailed opposition member in 1981 during martial law , and got bronze medal from communists for faithful service , and then was somehow admited to pis ) - praised polish supreme court recently for being so efficient ( to quote - `` unlike regular courts , supreme court is on european level '' ) . 
  now they say supreme court is too slow and needs reforming . 
  same guy , few month later . 
  it 's all just because it 's inconvenient for them because it restricts their power , and they ca n't change constitution , and know they wo n't ever have more power than now ( because of quirk of electoral system and very fortunate ( for them ) elections , where 3 small parties got almost to electoral threshold , but did n't go thorugh , so their votes went mostly to pis , ad thye got single majority ) . 
  the only postcommunist party in poland is sld , and they are n't even in the parliament . 
  but somehow politicians managed to persuade people their political enemies ( all coming from solidarity ) are communists . 
  krs appoints new judges to be sworn by president . 
  pis is taking over krs as well . 
  so they , in fact , can . 
  they can fire every chairman of every court , and every judge in supreme court . 
  they can discipline judges . 
  that 's a direct dependence introduced between judical and executive power . 
  there were already over 60 000 in warsaw and 100 000 in the whole poland . 
   the polish justices had been sitting in their positions of power ever since the communist dictatorship average age of polish judges is 38 years . 
  they were 10 in 1989 . 
  how are they communists ? 
   and they are thoroughly corrupt and engage in astronomical levels of nepotism sources ? 
   they choose their own successors , who always happen to be family and friends . 
  sources ? 
   why is donald tusk so adamant about this ? 
  his own son was able to avoid justice because of tusk 's connection to the communist judges . 
  his son earned 1500 euro by making an ad for amber gold as an independent consultant . 
  it 's not illegal , you do n't have to check when you sell ads if you customer is a financial pyramid . 
  there were lots of newspapers , including pro-pis ones , who did the same ( like wprost ) , but somehow the guy that 's guilty accordig to pis is tusk 's son . 
  so yeah , bullshit as usual . 
  on the other hand pis already canceled judical investigation against pis senate member bierecki , who is responsible for neglect in controlling skok banks ( many of which defaulted recently ) , malversation of public money ( abusing his position to chose his own private company to do audits and pay himself money that way ) . 
  and he trasnfered funds from defaulting skok to an account he and his brother owns in luxemburg . 
  that 's not mere 1500 euro btw . 
  it 's millions euro stolen directly to that account , and billions lost because of neglect . 
  pis took over persecutors ' office and immediately canceled the investigation . 
  now they wo n't have to do that - because they can as well just make the judge do whatever they wish , or otherways chairman of his court will be forced to fire him ( or otherways pis replaces the chairman of that court ) . 
  but you 're not here for truth , you 're here because you bought the cheap pis propaganda . 
  my translation is the official polish translation by who . 
  and it 's not `` physical power '' , it 's '' ( physical force ) or power '' . 
  `` physical ( force or power ) '' would make no sense . 
   `` the intentional use of physical force ** or power ** in polish , because you may not realize what power means there :  celowe u\u017cycie si\u0142y fizycznej ** lub w\u0142adzy ** source - same who definition : https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/przemoc as in - you force them with your administrative powers to step down , despite the constitution specifically forbidding that .
