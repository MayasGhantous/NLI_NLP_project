  yes . 
  but mostly it 's dresiarze you should be afraid of . 
  then it would just be map of stereotypes . 
  which fm was better ? 
  we can maybe argue about bartoszewski . 
  as a protest against the partition of poland , 
  it works the other way . 
  you drink and everybody else become gorgeous . 
  not having money = definitely not investing them , on the other hand , 
   combine means someting totally different than kombinowa\u0107 in that sense/context but that 's the whole point of idioms ? 
  never heard it in polish . 
  we have similar one - `` nawija\u0107 makaron na uszy '' - `` to spool pasta around someone 's ears '' , but the meaning is different ( to persuade someone to something so long it 's boring and annoying ) . 
  well , i even specified it 's `` literal '' translation . 
  nobody noticed . 
  it 's pronounced zwoti, 
  well , it turns out til  there was a polish z\u0142oty before that . 
  see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lcz1r/the_next_economic_powerhouse_poland/djtm4mn/, 
  yes . 
  and it was given to companies for free , just like gps . 
  some other polish ones : - `` kombinowa\u0107 jak ko\u0144 pod g\u00f3r\u0119 '' - literally `` to combine like a horse up the hill '' , meaning `` to try every excuse , shortcut , invention , anything possible - not to do what you must do the hard way in the end anyway '' - `` skaka\u0107 z kwiatka na kwiatek '' literally `` to jump from one flower to another '' , meaning `` to sleep around '' - `` wyj\u015b\u0107 na czym\u015b , jak zab\u0142ocki na mydle '' - literally `` to get even on something like zab\u0142ocki on the soap '' , meaning `` to try something clever only to lose a lot '' . 
  it comes from polish nobleman that tried to transport soap without paying the tarifs by putting it in sealed packages under a ship . 
  it turned out that the sealing was n't working . 
  - `` kmini\u0107 '' = literally `` to cumin '' , meaning `` to think hard about something , to plot something '' - `` rozkmini\u0107 '' = literally `` to cumin something off '' , meaning `` to completely understand something as a result of long and meticulous thinking , to grok something '', 
  because when it was introduced after the great crisis replacing hyperinflated marka polska - it was fully exchangeable with gold . 
  then of course ww2 happened , and after the war there was another polish z\u0142oty - communist one , which was n't based on gold , and after communism we got new polish z\u0142oty , which is n't based on gold either , but the name sticked . 
   taxpayers paid and private companies took all the profit . 
  and taxpayers got internet , which reduced prices of almost everything by considerable percent . 
  our car industry 's problem was that it was n't germans who bought it out . 
  if fso and fsc were bought by germans like skoda or seat , not by koreans - we would probably still have some car brands . 
  so happens i 'm working in it , and i already worked in two r&d companies that moved from uk and switzerland respectively to poland . 
  this time i even work on some hardware stuff , so it 's not only software we 're doing . 
   yeah , we should avoid that . 
  because ? 
  belarus can become russia faster than crimea did , to be honest . 
   when your opponent see you going a or b , you can choose c. go for the unexpected . 
  no thanks , we did that before ww2 . 
  - ally 3rd reich or ussr ? 
  - none of the above , please . 
  - ok , you lose 16 % of population and independence for 50 years . 
  good job . 
  mostly because few countries had government stupid enough to ally neither , but fight both at once . 
  do you mean pozna\u0144 and silesia uprisings ? 
  that was just after ww1 , when poland was regaining independence . 
  i do n't think sa even existed . 
  and i would n't call it `` excursions '' , it was a regular uprising . 
  or do you mean something else later ? 
  then i 'd like sources , i never heard of that and it sounds a lot like ww2 nazi propaganda . 
  funnily enough poland wanted to preemptively invade germany together with france and great britain in 1935 . 
  unfortunately allies declined . 
  we have vietnamese and ukrainians . 
   `` corporate innovation '' lol what is it supposed to mean ? 
  new , creative ways of lobbying for tax breaks ? 
  most innovation actually comes from big corporations and governments , simply because they have the money to invest . 
  also poland is doing quite ok in basic sciences ( mostly physics , chemistry and biology ) : http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7642/full/nj7642-507a.html `` poland is already pulling ahead of the rest of eastern europe in terms of research output , and it is gaining ground globally , according to nature index data from 2015 -- 16 . 
  the nation is ranked 24th in the world for quality research output . '', 
   government is not supposed to `` support '' private sector . 
  either government owns a r&d company ( lg case ) or it forces private sector to do r&d ( nokia case ) . 
  or the innovations are funded by the government , and then private sector is used to commercialize them ( ike in silicon valley ) . 
   we should facilitate the reintroduction of large predators such as the wolf . 
  well , obviously . 
  i thought it 's already happening ? 
  http://www.psur.pl/a.aspx?id=183 around 18 celcius on average in the holidays ( july-august ) . 
  the warmest is near the end of august . 
  shit is 36.6 c, 
   in most of central and eastern europe at that time in most of western europe and america as well . 
  proportions were different , though . 
  also , historian timothy snyder argues that the main factor leading to holocaust is n't antisemitism ( which was widespread in europe since middle ages ) , but big jewish population and a destruction of state . 
  jews in countries with no law enforcement and no institutions ( so - in countries conquered by third reich ) were killed in huge majority . 
  jews in countries that were even the most antisemitic ( like nazi germany ) - lived in bigger proportions , because it was a lot of paperwork to actually kill them . 
  no such problems in the east - just round the whole village up above a freshly dug grave , and shot them all . 
  no need for paperwork . 
  btw most of holocaust happened that way , performed usually by german policeman , sometimes with help of some locals ( that got to keep the homes and some wealth of the jews ) , in a few km range from the place the jews lived their whole lives . 
  death camps were only responsible for a fraction of all the deaths . 
  there 's lots of misconceptions around holocaust , both in germany and in poland . 
  easy to pick on them . 
  makes for as good a scape goat as any other , or better . 
  and that 's how you control a society - by creating common enemies . 
  starrted building in 1925 , made useless in 1926  that 's poland for you . 
  they were a nation of europe , yes . 
   claimed holocaust was n't perpetuated solely by germans , but in unison with poles . 
  well that 's technically true . 
  not only poles as well , most nations of europe were represented . 
  the only difference is proportions - most poles were n't participating . 
   both sanation and prometheism were j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski 's things . 
  prometheism was widely popular in poland since 19th century , see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/for_our_freedom_and_yours  regardless of who was worse , you still have n't established a casual link casual link goes like this - totalitarian state is a worse neighbor than non-totalitarian state , therefore they supported movements against totalitarian states . 
  putin is the queen . 
  well , if you do n't have any verbal arguments beating works . 
  i never claimed poland was a perfect democracy at the time . 
  i 'll just remind that we were speaking of 20s , before the coup . 
  but even still - authoritharian poland vs totalitarian soviet union is no contest . 
  there were no mass murders , starvation , gulags , nor political terror there . 
  bereza kartuska is bad , but no comparison . 
  i agree , of course , that sanacja was a very bad government for poland ( and we paid the price - losing independence and 16 % of population ) , and endecja ( the only alternative at the time ) would be even worse . 
  because if there 's a movement in nearby country which wants to liberate itself from a tyrant , it 's usually a good idea to support it . 
  because being a neighbor to a well-off democracy that treats its citizens like people is preferable to being a neighbor to a huge totalitarian state . 
  same reason poland supported independence of lithuania , latvia , estonia , belarus , ukraine , etc in nineties . 
  same reason it supports belarusian opposition , and supported juszczenko when janukowycz falsified the elections . 
  that 's the problem - you treat history like bargaining chip . 
   i do n't know whether poland would have invaded ussr with hitler , given the opportunity , poland was invited to anti-comintern pact by germany in november 1935 and rejected the invitation . 
   but it did support prometheism in soviet union well , obviously poland supported any independence movements in soviet russia .
