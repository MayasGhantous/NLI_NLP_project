  might i remind you , that at that point soviet union murdered hundreds of thousands of its citizens ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_killings_under_communist_regimes#soviet_union ) , and in a few next years - murdered millions more ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) . 
  that includes murdering non-russians because of their nationality , in national operations of nkvd ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_operations_of_the_nkvd ) . 
  why would n't you support giving these people independence of the regime that kills them and causes mass starvations ? 
   and we have treated our history basically like germans in 90s no you did n't . 
  not even close . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reparations_agreement_between_israel_and_west_germany  and we got nothing from that . 
  why should you get anything for admitting the truth ? 
  lol , nationalism is a priviledge now . 
  it 's like you envied someone a fever . 
  yup , unfortunately . 
  also anything happens in germany , it 's reported as `` german conspiracy to ... '' , `` merkel wants to destroy polish x by doing ... '' , `` germans want to remove responsibility for ww2 by ... '' , `` leftists in germany caused tragedy ... to happen '' , etc. 
  not to the level of russian media , but getting close . 
   another european supporting pre-ww2 borders ? 
   where ? 
   i agree . 
  take back lw\u00f3w . 
  i do n't follow . 
  why should we ? 
  well , russian tv argue that poles wanted to invade russia with hitler : https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=150&amp;v=ecny3yhhbo8 while it was the opposite ( look up ribbentrop-mo\u0142otov pact and invasion of poland by soviet army on 17th september 1939 ) . 
  kinda hard to argue with facts . 
   your positions are broadly similar which ones ? 
  it is misrepresentation . 
  imagine if a global warming debate had 1 mad ecologist shouting `` you '' re all shills paid by petrol companies '' , and several normal guys arguing it 's not real . 
  even if some people think most global warming deniers are paid by petrol industry - it 's far from their best argument . 
  and most people supporting anti-global warming measures are n't mad ecologists . 
  it 's not exotic to equate communists with nazis . 
  but if you 're trying to persuade someone to start believing historic facts it 's quite counterproductive to call his grandpa a fascist . 
  his whole performance ( and he is invited there regularly ) is to make serious arguments look ridiculous by association . 
  they invite polish \u017byrinovski ( korwin mikke ) , and maciejczuk - a guy that ukrainians forbid to return to ukraine because of `` spreading russian propaganda '' whatever that means . 
  i 'm liking how you thought the best response to an article showing russia in negative light is to basically say `` poles are mostly assholes '' . 
   i 'm amazed that china , worse on human rights by miles , is rarely as demonised as russia . 
  china have n't invaded any european country as of late . 
  in fact - iirc - never . 
  on the contrary russia stopped occupation of some european countries just 25 years ago , and started occupation of other just 3 years ago . 
  well , he argued `` women are less inteligent '' . 
  he also thinks they should n't have voting rights , but that 's irrelevant , because democracy is stupid anyway , right ? 
  they first admited that katy\u0144 was a soviet crime in 1993 , as late as 2010 miedviedev said that it was obviously soviet crime . 
  right now it seems it 's false again . 
  that 's how the history is in russia - you never know what will be true about the past tommorow , 
  yeah that was the main point of the article . 
  oh please , korwin-mikke is n't a politician , he 's a clown . 
  like \u017birinovski in russia . 
  during communism he was a member of sanctioned pseudoopposition party in poland , then he moved to political entertainment business , provoking people with simplistic and absurd statements with just enough arguments so that it ca n't be debunked in 5 minutes . 
  examples : `` invalids should n't be shown in tv '' , `` hitler might have not knew about holocaust '' , `` global warming is false '' , `` democracy is bad , poland should be a monarchy '' . 
  please do n't treat him seriously . 
   yes , in that the cameras are turned away . 
  so , your thesis is - usa is the same as russia because in both people beat each other ? 
  i can agree to the second part , but not to the conculsion . 
  also what does it have in common with the fact that russian tv shows it live ? 
  would you argue reality tv where one guy murders the other is ok , because in other countries people kill each other too ? 
  what 's this with russian defenders that they almost always choose to argument using whataboutism ? 
   outside their properties , not in them . 
  so , in fact , it 's nothing like that . 
   you must not watch a lot of western tv , do you ? 
  daily show , sometimes . 
  other than that mostly sciencey stuff . 
  neither would i call `` hate festivals '' . 
  i think you mistake comedy or critique with hate . 
   almost all countries do this . 
  when was the last time someone beat up a guest in bbc show ? 
  how about twice the same guy ? 
  if you rewrite stuff in a way abstract enough everything is the same ( all countries do tv shows ) , but details matter , so no , all countries do n't do the same . 
  the hate festivals like in russian tv does n't happen in the west . 
  russia does this , it 's on youtube , you do n't have to believe , you can just watch it for yourself . 
  there are even people routinely invited for such shows to play the scape goat . 
  like this pole - tomasz maciejczuk . 
  he must earn well doing that , because he was already beaten twice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noci15mbv2c job of such people is to be unlikeable and present arguments of the opposite side in such way that average russian viewer wo n't accept them . 
  he called russians `` red nazis '' in that show and was beaten for that on vision . 
  the bad thing about that is the hate session , not the fact that they clap on order , surely ? 
  well what do you expect . 
  it 's a job that requires you to live for years in men-only dormitory and wear skirts . 
  police got recording which shows nothing . 
  it 's not a proof for either story . 
  the accusation was that someone else benefits from these people lying . 
  it 's obviouusly a conspiracy theory . 
  cui bono means who benefits , meaning he thinks it 's a conspiracy . 
  what 's false , and how do you know ? 
  saying `` fake news '' instead of `` false '' , and `` cui bono '' instead of `` it 's a conspiracy '' does n't make your conspiracy theory less stupid . 
  bigger market = less overhead per sale = lower prices . 
  what did you expect ? 
  welcome to poland . 
  that 's literally how any public discussion goes novadays . 
  today government spokeperson said she `` do n't agree with nationalists who beat anti-government protesters in radom , but understand their emotions '' . 
  and these fuckers have 34 % suport : /, 
  because they could n't understood them ? 
  wprost helped amber gold when it was already known it 's a fraud for one example . 
  http://wyborcza.pl/7,75398,21996629,operacja-mlody-tusk-jak-wprost-wspieral-amber-gold.html and published article titled `` knf is trying to destroy amber gold '' . 
  not that i think they lie in this case , they do n't have any interest in doing so , they probably just report what police told them . 
  why would you go to police when you 're on a trip to make a false accusation ? 
  it 's much more probable it 's true , unfortunately . 
  especially given recent muslim histeria in poland . 
  we should 've replaced these stupid nonstandard units megaseconds ago . 
   there was no depopulation during the gdr times mostly because they could n't move out , 
  too much nuisance , little value . 
  they take over and nothing changes . 
  i hope they get invaded by general contact unit from culture universe , 
  trees will win over time . 
  raspberries do n't grow 10 meters tall . 
   if left without intervention it may face utter destruction at worst most of 20 % of the forest ( spruce trees ) will die . 
  btw in natural forests in poland spruce make up for much less than 20 % of the population .
