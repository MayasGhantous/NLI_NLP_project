  all the while the whole country is stopped for their convenience , and there are religious manifestations in every single village/town/city . 
  i do n't care , have your holidays , you 're welcome , but stop complaining already . 
  smole\u0144sk political demonstrations are classified as religious by their own politicians . 
  if the news is `` this happened '' , i understand , but when the news is `` this person said this on twitter '' how is twitter a bad source ? 
  you have no idea how far it went in poland . 
  confirmed opposition members from the communist time , like niesio\u0142owski , who was imprisoned and tortured by communists is now called a post-communist and defender of ub ( communist secret police ) because he disagree with pis . 
  former supporters of pis , like jadwiga staniszkis , who changed her mind after the constutitional tribunal debacle - are called the same . 
  despite the fact she was a member of solidarity and was praised by kaczy\u0144ski for years when she supported them . 
  celebrities are shitstormed when they say anything critical . 
  maryla rodowicz ( + - polish lady gaga from 80s ) is now a communist apparently ( pis newspapers published her photos on a beach with some communist leader from 80s ) , because she did n't wanted to participate in a national song festival after other artists were banned because of participation in opposition march . 
  polish gordon ramsay ( mak\u0142owicz ) was removed from public tv after congratulations on twitter to donald tusk , and he 's now called a `` resort child '' ( 1 ) , and `` communist '' as well . 
  all protesters , even people who were n't alive during communism are called communists and thieves by kaczy\u0144ski . 
  the logic is - they surely had a grandpa in ub if they protest against pis . 
  and people buy into this . 
  ( 1 ) it 's a category for all critics that were n't in communist party or maybe even were n't alive during communism , but their father or grandpa or uncle , or whoever - were . 
  or even if not - they started their careers during communism so they are tainted , obviously . 
  the only exception - if you 're in pis it does n't matter . 
  you do n't build walls on borders you intend to cross soon . 
  s/you must be fascist then / do you see it now ? 
  i follow both polish and american politics . 
  even accounting for trump and fox news - polish politics is worse . 
  their flag will , most certainly . 
  like most of these kinds of propaganda contrary to apperances it 's actually targeted inwards . 
   sure you can say the only reason for anyone to behave in a moral way is self-interest . 
  rational is n't the same as selfish . 
  rational just means following logical reasoning and not emotions . 
  you argue against egoism , not against rationality . 
  in fact there 's no rational reason to assume apriori that your needs are more important than needs of anybody else . 
  it 's your instincts and emotions that make you value your pleasure more than pleasure that other people feel . 
   but does that mean when it ceases to be in your self interest not to kill people then it 's fine ? 
  if i followed your example and build anti-rationalists strawman i could say `` if you follow emotions is it ok to kill someone you do n't like ? '' . 
  it 's obviously not , and you do n't argue that , so i wo n't pretend you do . 
  please be so kind and do n't put weak arguments in my mouth . 
   the reality is that rationality ca n't tell you what is right and wrong . 
  nothing can tell you that . 
  you have to deduce it on your own . 
  taking your basic instincts and building morality on that seems to me to be very fragile and naive . 
  they felt because of the same dumb mistake russia already made 3 times ? 
  can you maybe remind me what happened to tsarist russia ? 
   how can anything have value at all without emotion ? 
  living is the precondition to anything you do therefore your life has value to you . 
  there 's no reason to assume your life is more valuable than the lives of others , so everybodys ' lives have value . 
  why do you need emotions for that ? 
  empathy is emotion . 
  you do n't need emotions to understand that human life has value . 
  also empathy only works one-target-at-a-time . 
  that 's why stalin said `` death of a person is tragedy , death of millions is statistics '' . 
  people can empathize with 1 other person no problem , they do n't empathize with millions . 
  but million deaths is objectively worse than 1 death . 
  should n't have gambled with the whole country at stake , then , 
  empathy is what makes people turn the car to save a dog and kill all passangers and themselves . 
  or this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trolley_problem politicians should be rational , not emotional . 
  half of ussr ( by population ) is n't russia now . 
  it can ( and imho - will ) happen again , if russia continues to focus on bullying neighbors instead of focusing on actually developing healthy economy and friendly relations with neighbors . 
  the only way it might escape that fate is - reform and become a proper european democracy , or reform and become a bigger north korea . 
  it seems russians like their propaganda so much they prefer the north korea route , 
  that 's why ussr will exist forever . 
  oh wait it collapsed because of economy and military overspending . 
  kinda reminds me of sth . 
  tbh dead pigs probably do n't mind . 
  i do n't `` hate '' russia . 
  i just wish it was a normal country and not the problem-maker for everyone around that it is . 
  as for russia-china comparison , this graph should show you why it 's china that is the tyson there  https://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:chn:usa:rus&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false, 
  you seriously think russia is the tyson against china , 
   china ca n't take from russia . 
  it most certainly can . 
  a question of price . 
  and tbh the way things are going it might have a good occasion in a decade or two when russian federation defaults . 
  see 1991 . 
  is it common for mp to switch parties mid-term in uk ? 
   if we call them stupid for doing this , we 're saying democracy is stupid and if you call one guy a bad driver you mean all drivers are bad . 
  seriously ... 
  i kinda like them , when they are renovated . 
  they make for a green city . 
  that would make a lot of sense , actually . 
  you usually buy 10 or 15 or 20 or 25 deko . 
  dividing price ( always given per kg ) by 5 is a little harder than by 10 , though . 
  i live in former russian partition ( well , it was austrian for a few years as well , it 's complicated ) . 
  not really ma\u0142opolska , but that depends on your definition ( it was part of ma\u0142opolska in commonwealth times ) . 
  anyway , it 's not regional - i also lived in warsaw on and off , and i visited the whole poland basically , and it is used everywhere all the time . 
  interesting . 
  do you use ar ( 10x10 m ) and hektar ( 100x100 m ) for land area ? 
  in poland it 's m ^ 2 for flats and rooms , ar and hektar for most land areas you buy ( for building or farming ) , and for huge areas it 's km ^ 2 obviously . 
  ah , right . 
  there 's dekalog as well , 
  deci is * 0.1 , deka is * 10 . 
  you use decigrams ? 
  or do you mean decimeters ? 
  somehow people prefer to say `` 10 cm '' than `` 1 dm '' . 
  i guess the fact that ruler and measuring tape is always scalled in cm or m helps . 
  but still a liter is dm ^ 3 . 
  and liter is used quite a lot  on the other hand in poland at least dekagram is used very often - you buy meat and other food by weight using dekagrams . 
  like `` 20 deko of this kie\u0142basa , please '' . 
  would make more sense to use `` 2 hektagrams '' but nobody says that . 
   i wonder what would the people of scotland and catalonia do if an angry mob of people staged an uprising in london either it was angry mob ( so it was not staged , but a real uprising ) , or it was staged ( but then it was n't staged by the angry mob , that 's just stupid ) . 
  please try to be self-consistent at least . 
  government of ukraine was shooting to protesters and killed about 100 of them . 
  no wonder they 've overthhrown it . 
  and you do n't have to wonder what would catalonians do - there was a revolution in spain in 1975 and then in 1981 . 
  no civil wars somehow , and european union ( the pussies ) did n't intevened .
