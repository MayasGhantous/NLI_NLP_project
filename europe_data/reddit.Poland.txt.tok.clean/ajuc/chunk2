  he specifically mentioned absolute monarchy . 
  yeah , i noticed after adding the link : /, 
  making of : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8srdho1dctc&amp;src_vid=32vlogn_3qq&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=channel%3a5448876a-0000-25fc-8e3b-001a113d44e8 quote from member of the team : `` i 'm very surprised you need something like this at all now . 
  mankind sends a probe into space to catch a comet and land on it , and we need great director , film and actors to convince people this is interesting '' . 
   the peak of the massacres took place in july and august 1943 when a senior upa commander , dmytro klyachkivsky , ordered the liquidation of the entire male polish population between 16 and 60 years of age . 
  [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] despite this , most of the victims were women and children .

  polish football fans ( especially club football ) have higher-than-average share of racists , nationalists , bandits and idiots . 
  do not judge poles basing on that group only . 
  thank you . 
  yes . 
  some of them . 
  but statistically speaking men are more probable to be interested in this . 
  maybe this will change , maybe not , but for now pc should n't force people to negate facts . 
  would look different if the survey was n't in english probably , 
  to be precise - zamojski family was called after zamo\u015b\u0107 village ( now stary zamo\u015b\u0107 or old zamo\u015b\u0107 ) , as usual for polish nobles . 
  before they bought it they were called \u0141a\u017ai\u0144ski . 
  later jan zamoyski turned this into his `` ideal city '' with the help of italian architect . 
  zamoyski was one of polish-lithuanian commonwealth magnates - he owned more land than many contemporary countries , he created state-in-the-state that was called zamoyski ordynat , in the whole lublin region there are traces of this - for example well-preserved koz\u0142\u00f3wka palace . 
  little known fact - zamo\u015b\u0107 region had uprising during ww2 against germans that lasted from 1942 till 1944 - almost nobody even in poland knows this , while lost warsaw uprising is all over media all the time . 
  meanwhile - zamo\u015b\u0107 uprising was more or less successful . 
  20 % unemployement 15 years ago . 
  change sex and all will be well . 
  for to quality of life yuo must of being homosex and tolerance . 
  poland had mass protests in january-february ( -20 celcius ) over acta . 
  this would start real revolution . 
  so , 1 beer for each gb . 
  good job orban . 
  crowd is better drunk than informed . 
  i think he meant uk not poland , 
  if your conspiracy theory has people forcing russians to drink it 's wrong . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
  these same lands also historicaly belonged to polish-lithuanian commonwealth , so what ? 
  btw kaliningrad was german ( and polish on few occasions ) , and almost the whole russia historicaly belonged to vikings , mongols , and for shorter periods to other countries . 
  `` this is mine because it was mine at some point '' is just dumb argument . 
  otherways russia give back siberia to natives !, 
  50/50 more or less . 
  poland is divided between po supporters ( slightly more liberal ) and pis supporters ( slightly more conservative ) , and each time there are elections these parties get almost the same result , difference is a few percent points . 
  pis thinks smole\u0144sk was a coup , po thinks it was accident . 
  i would love to see putin judged in hague . 
  in poland propagating both nazism and communism is illegal , including demonstrations with ussr or iiird reich flag . 
  so you 're wrong . 
  poland did evil thing in xxth century history ( \u017beligowski action for example ) i admit . 
  but your comparison is very misleading . 
  ak in lithuania was fighting nazis - german and lithuanian ones . 
  nazis ( also lithuanians ) were murdering hundreds of tousands of jews , also hundreds polish civilians . 
  lithuanian paartizans were helping them in hope of regaining lithuania . 
  polish partizans were fighting them cause they wanted this to be poland after the war . 
  i ca n't watch youtube right now , but i 've searched wikipedia and i only found this 1 massacre by ak in lithuania : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dubingiai_massacre while it obiovusly is evil and the people responsible should be put to court martial for killing civilians , you can not compare this to upa . 
  first - it was a direct response to massacre did by lithuanian nazi police on polish civilians just before in that village http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glinciszki_massacre second - it was 1000 times smaller in scale than upa actions . 
  if you have textual information about other massacres by ak i 'm intrested . 
  yes and stealing companies from their owners is anti-cleptocracy , 
  was . 
  best preserved german concentration camp ( at least from those in poland ) is in majdanek ( now part of lublin ) . 
  also lublin had 30 % jewish minority pre-ww2 , the most important jewish religious school in the world at the time was in lublin : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chachmei_lublin_yeshiva , early hassidism was big in lublin thanks to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yaakov_yitzchak_of_lublin and the oldest preserved jewish cemetary in poland is in lublin . 
  it was very important city for jews before the war . 
  depends . 
  towards jewish people it lasted ( with small exceptions ) from early medieval times till xxth century . 
  towards other religions it ended around the time of zygmunt iii waza , but it certainly started before 16th century . 
  for example there 's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pawe%c5%82_w%c5%82odkowic - he was representant of poland on various diplomatic occasions , rector of cracow academy and he wrote about pagans and christians coexisting peacefully in early 15th century already ( and criticized teutonic order for their crusades against lithuanians - pope even started investigation because of that ) . 
  i think it 's safe to assume such people would n't be representatives of poland if such attitude was rare in poland . 
   it was exactly because of these open minded attributes of the polish sejm that got it divided . 
  now that 's a novel interpretation of polish history . 
  we got partitioned because we were gay ? 
  most tourist are from israel . 
  most foreigners from ukraine , norway , and various muslim countries ( they study at lublin medical university ) . 
  russia is against nazis . 
  russia is against estonia . 
  therefore estonia is nazi . 
  what more proof do you need ? 
  it rather depends on the value of usd , 
  there 's old saying from communist time in poland : `` government will feed itself '' . 
  it means there are always money for politicians , militia and army , even if people starve on the streets . 
  france want money over eu unity . 
  poland provides monetary motivation for france to do the right thing , 
  kto rosomak is finnish it 's the second biggest purchase after f-16 in polish aremd forces . 
  we bought anti-ship missiles from norway recently , too . 
  and of course we bought over 200 tanks from germany recently . 
  so - no . 
  when you have many customers and one supplier - supplier sets the rules . 
  when you have many suppliers and one customer - customer sets the rules . 
  russia will try to make everything to prevent mergin 28 clients into one , including preferential prices short-term to stop that . 
  in the end it is still beneficial for every country in eu to be one client and not 28 . 
  we won with brasil in volleyball so the biggest jesus in the world paid off already . 
  the city of tom bombabil . 
  yes , most ( 90 % + ) young poles never learnt it . 
  migration is the worst among the poor and uneducated . 
  for example most criminals went abroad because it 's more profitable to steal in uk  also some of the brightests migrate , but still some stay . 
  many people migrate for a few years and return with what they 've learnt . 
  we will see what 's better for the country in the long term , but for the people involved it 's certainly better that they have a choice . 
  in the communist poland they would be forced to stay and they would have much worse life . 
  better plumber in germany than russian asslicker and useless paper-mover in poland . 
  at least in the end there 's plumbing done and when everybody do useless stuff there 's nothing to show for it . 
  just like in russia i guess  even muslim countries manage their oil better than russia . 
  anyway most poles moved to uk and ireland , not germany . 
  lol http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gospodarka_polski_ludowej#mediaviewer/file:gdppercapita.png gdp per capita of poland , spain , and south korea since 1950 . 
  just after the war we were on par with spain and better than south korea . 
  then till 70s we did nothing and they outgrew us , then gierek took credits on the west and bought us few years of dumb growth , then it all ended when investitions turned out to be dumb ( as always in communism ) . 
  no , europe had its time , but it ended with ww2 . 
  now it 's all usa and china , and we are for usa what greeks were to romans  now europe is becoming backwater and this will only continue because of demographics , immigration , political conflicts etc.
