  actually it 's ok in lublin and most of poland ( i 've even been told it 's ok to drink tap water in warsaw , but i still woulnd ' t - it looks weird  ) . 
  it was n't ok to drink tap water in poland 20-30 years ago because of communist einvironmental standards and people got used to buy bottled water or at least boil the water before drinking it . 
  tests from 2010 ( polish ) : http://www.sng.com.pl/zalaczniki/pdf/raport_brita.pdf, 
  yes . 
  people would understand , but it 's not proper polish . 
  it 's politic after all . 
  both are grammaticaly correct ( the cases and times check out ) , but `` robi\u0107 decyzj\u0119 '' is n't a phrase in polish , it does n't mean anything . 
  of course people would figure it out . 
  it 's like saying `` to do a decision '' in english . 
  in polish you do n't make decisions , you undertake them . 
  it 's confusing , because we also have `` republika '' which is more direct translation of `` republic '' . 
  so `` rzeczpospolita '' is republic when it applies to poland , and any other republic is just `` republika '' , 
  for polish it 's `` za\u017c\u00f3\u0142\u0107 g\u0119\u015bl\u0105 ja\u017a\u0144 '' , or `` en-yellow the ego of gusles '' . 
  as nonsense in polish as in english , but contains every polish special character . 
  `` d\u017cd\u017cy\u0107 '' = to rain with small drops . 
  [ pronounciation ] ( http://www.ivona.com/pl/?tk=1klq91oxyy ) . 
  also `` d\u017cd\u017cownica '' ( [ pronounciation ] ( http://www.ivona.com/pl/?tk=vxgoe1f3r5 ) ) = earthworm ( that always comes out after rain ) . 
  archaic word for rain in polish was `` de\u017cd\u017c '' ( noun ) which probably comes from pra-indoeuropeic dus-diu-s ( bad weather ) . 
  in old polish the verb was `` d\u017cd\u017cy\u0107 '' , now the noun `` de\u017cd\u017c '' changed to `` deszcz '' and the most commonly used verb is `` pada\u0107 '' ( to fall ) , but for small rain `` d\u017cd\u017cy\u0107 '' is still used . 
  the noun `` de\u017cd\u017c '' disappeared , it only remains in one place in live polish - in proverb `` jak kania d\u017cd\u017cu '' its used conjugated . 
  many poles think the word was `` d\u017cd\u017c '' and not `` de\u017cd\u017c '' cause both forms would conjugate to `` d\u017cd\u017cu '' . 
  `` d\u017cd\u017c '' would be even cooler word if it ever existed , 
  john is n't `` rzon '' or '' \u017bon '' . 
  it 's `` d\u017con '' . 
  same with jungle ( `` d\u017cangl '' not '' \u017cangl '' ) . 
  also there are differences in pronounciation between `` rz '' and '' \u017c '' . 
  `` rz '' is basicaly either '' \u017c '' or `` sz '' depending on previous letter . 
  it 's not . 
  english `` j '' ( like in jungle ) is `` d\u017c '' in polish . 
  btw : my favorite polish word is `` d\u017cd\u017cy '' ( = it rains a little ) . 
  good luck pronouncing that . 
  `` rz '' and '' \u017c '' is more like `` j '' in french `` je t ` aime '' . 
  so without the starting half-formed `` d '' in pronounciation that `` d\u017c '' ( jungle ) have . 
  anyway - polish is at least consisten with how letters maps to sounds . 
  english is actually 2 languages - written and spoken , that you need to learn separately . 
  so instead of 9 nonstandard characters we would use 32 of them  seems like a good idea . 
  it 's correlated , so if you can predict basing on the former you also can predict basing on the latter . 
  with less probability , but still . 
  example : you get randomly choosen people from all over the world and ask them to cross a street . 
  you record which way they look at first . 
  can you predict it with better accuracy when you know their ethnicity than without knowing it ? 
  because i can  ethnicity is correlated with the place you 're living ( most people live where they were born ) . 
  and that 's correlated with your upbringing . 
  and that changes many things in your behaviour . 
  people arguing that you ca n't predict behaviour basing on ethnicity are basically too scared someone 'll call them a racist to think for themselves . 
  of course the predictions would be imperfect , often almost useless ( 0.0001 better than without prior knowledge of ethcnicity ) , but still would be better than same predictions without knowing anything about some person . 
  l'viv ( then lw\u00f3w ) , and vilnius ( then wilno ) had mostly polish population , and ussr cared nothing about this after the war . 
  these were 2 out of the 4 most important polish cities for the last 500 years , along with warsaw and krak\u00f3w . 
  and we neither started nor lost ww2 unlike germany . 
  germans complaining about losing gda\u0144sk which was n't technicaly theirs before ww2 anyway ( free city , remember ? 
  ) , and to get which they started a war killing millions of people are just absurd . 
  just like poles that want to regain l'viv or vilnius today ( but these are mostly jokes , the people seriously talking about this are either very old or very youg , and are lacking any sense of political reality ) . 
  ski jumping is the most fair . 
  i did , actually , 
  it 's not a thing in poland . 
  mostly because catholic church accepts evolution and does n't require literal interpretation of bible . 
  in poland it 's mandatory to say `` hello '' , do the shopping , then say `` thanks '' just after you got your change/receipt . 
  `` goodbye '' is optional in the shop ( because you can conceivably visit the shop later that day ) . 
  poland : take out your shoes when visiting someone ( especially older than let 's say 30 years ) . 
  you will be given `` guest slippers '' . 
  but our gdp was roughly equal in 1989 , and ukraine got more of its gdp from industry then as well . 
  so `` in the ukraine on the other hand there was always almost non-existent industry '' is false . 
  as for modern times i 'd argue ukraine still has bigger industry , it 's just less efficient than ours . 
  we closed unprofitable factories or sold them ( mostly in nineties ) . 
  ukraine kept them working . 
  for one example : ukraine produced 42\u00a0830\u00a0000 tons of crude steel in 2007 . 
  poland 10\u00a0631\u00a0000 tons . 
  on the other hand we produce more high value goods . 
  actually ukraine had and has much more industry than poland , most ussr factories were in modern ukraine . 
  that 's why ukraine still has ok aerospace and military industry . 
  for example in 2010 25.9 % of ukraine gdp was produced by industry , for poland it was 24.5 % , and for germany 23.8 % . 
  [ source ] ( http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/quickstatistics/readtable.asp?qs_id=11 ) of course efficiency is another matter , that 's why polish gdp grew faster . 
  but germans are better ( at least if you consider jewish germans ) . 
  i guess the percentages for countries are calculated with the base of 2,900.1 ( total members and associates ) , and the percentages below that ( for example the eu one ) are calculated with the base 4,282.1 ( total esa ) . 
  that would make esa percentage 21.3 % but the germany 772.7 mil - 26.6 % , so it 's still not right , but closer . 
  according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_thruster  ion thrusters carry a fundamental price : the power imparted to the exhaust increases with the square of its velocity while the thrust increases only linearly so such engines work best for small thrusts . 
  i guess you could just put a few such engines side by side ( kerbal space program approach  ) but then the engines mass would make it less efficient . 
  well , yes . 
  for missions like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smart-1 it 's negligible . 
  the whole program cost was 110\u00a0000\u00a0000 euro , the propellant cost for 82kg of xenon was under 100 000 usd ( at least according to the price i found . 
  they probably pay less for such amount  . 
  so less than 1 promile of the price . 
  but it was a short range mission ( lunar orbit ) with expansive instruments and the propellant was just 22 % of mass . 
  big part of cost is design because probes are usually made in very small series . 
  if we wanted to mass produce probes for some reason the costs would go down for everything but the materials and launching . 
  for cheap long range probes that are designed once and produced in big series it may be useful ( why would we want to mass produce cheap small long-range probes i do n't know . 
  maybe to survey resources on asteroids ? ) . 
  edit i 've found [ costs to leo per kg ] ( http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/1989/what-is-the-current-cost-per-pound-to-send-something-into-leo ) the cheapest in that table - ukrainian/russian dnepr is 3784 $ . 
  so it 's 4984 $ for 1 kg of xenon in orbit and 4014 $ for 1 kg of krypton in orbit . 
  not a huge difference but also not negligible . 
  of course i probably missed many other costs , but in case we started to mass produce that the price of propellant would go up too . 
  btw i do n't know why you are downvoted . 
  we already are of being into space : scientific satelite lem ( brite-pl ) : http://www.n2yo.com/?s=39431 students ' satelite pw-sat : http://www.n2yo.com/?s=38083 do n't tell r/polandball, 
  like all plasma thrusters designed so far it has very small power , but very high specific impulse ( roughly speaking - efficiency ) . 
  so it 's only good when your ship is already in space , and it 's meant to work continously slowly accelerating the ship , instead of the way chemical engines are used ( short burn and months of waiting , another short burn , etc ) . 
  it uses very small amounts of propelant ( the stuff it throws back ) , and does n't need fuel at all ( only energy - for example from solar panels ) . 
  in the long run it 's better than chemical engines , but it takes time to accelerate the ship , so people would need to take more food , making the fuel savings moot for crewed ships . 
  it could work for bigger probes than 100 kg , it would just accelerate them even slower . 
  the insitute is working on bigger and smaller models already . 
  video from the tests : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp48eb4lr54 looks like sci-fi space engines  the engine has mass of 4 kg and is 12 cm long , it has enough lift to operate 100 kg probes in space ( but it 's not apropriate for launching anything into space ) .
