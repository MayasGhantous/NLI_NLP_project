  it 's supposed to be aproximately as efficient as other plasma thrusters using hall effect , while being much cheaper than them because it uses cheaper krypton ( $ 33 per 100 g ) instead of xenon ( $ 120 per 100 g ) . 
  both gases are obtained from liquified air by fractional distillation , but krypton is 11 times more abundant ( 1 part per 1 000 000 vs 1 part per 11\u00a0000\u00a0000 for xenon in air , similar proportion holds in space according to [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noble_gas ) ) . 
  previous article about the engine ( from 2011 ) : http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111006084023.htm, 
   however , it 's not sustainable as eventually the trust fades away and you have a serious financial crisis . 
  why ? 
  you just have to stop borrowing more at the right point ( which is imho as soon as the crisis is over ) . 
   eurozone is a smart way to avoid this . 
  first , the interest rates will go down , but more importantly : eurobonds so you say poland should do what greece did - borrow more than it can pay back thanks to euro ? 
  1 . what it is now except with common army and better economy 2 . what it is now except without uk , with a few new countries , and with worse economy, 
  eu takes most of its gas elsewhere ( norway , uk , usa ) , only eastern parts of it are moslty dependent on russia . 
  and do n't forget that russia needs money from gas and oil exports to work . 
  every time prices fall russia has crisis . 
  if putin turned the gas off for a few months it would wreak havoc in russian economy worse than whatever it does to eu . 
  yeah , religion has proven itself as a great tool for keeping power . 
  it does n't mean it 's a good idea . 
  poland : has to be [ maluch ( fiat 126p ) ] ( http://idn.org.pl/users/teresa23/images/maluch.gif ) contenders : [ fso polonez ] ( http://klub80.pl/photos/polon.jpg ) [ fso syrena ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d3hti98w6ze/t-ohgp6kaui/aaaaaaaadts/cqiqcbzfcie/s1600/syrena%2b105.jpg ) [ fso warszawa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/fso_warszawa_223_in_wolsztyn.jpg ), 
  polish proverb about smiling ( laughing ) without a reason : '' \u015amieje si\u0119 jak g\u0142upi do sera '' ( he laughs like a dumb towards cheese ) . 
  laugh and smile are very similar words : \u015bmiech = laugh , u\u015bmiech = smile . 
  few people smile with visible tooth , it seems forced ( and forced smile is a little insulting ) . 
  and yeah - people smiling all the time towards strangers are perceived as dishonest and weird . 
  smiling nad laughing among friends is obviously ok . 
  get your greatest hero , make him a president for a few years , see how many people still think he 's a hero  besides there 's some evidence that he was in fact acting as an agent of polish communists security service at least for some time during the strikes ( not 100 % sure - the documents could have been falsified by communists ) . 
  it 's also strange how wa\u0142\u0119sa got money from nowhere during communism ( he said he won lottery a few times ) , and some people say he was transported into the closed docks during the strike by communist militia to allow them to control the strikes . 
  such accusations are fueled by the fact that many poles do n't like the `` thick line '' policy ( meaning communists were n't persecuted after peacefully giving up the power in 89-90 , and they found themselves in preferable conditions in early nineties to become company owners , businessman etc because they knew important people ) . 
  also - for many people [ j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_pi%c5%82sudski ) is still the greatest polish hero . 
  so what if it is ? 
  canned into space is a nice metaphore . 
  to hell with influence and power games . 
  less people is no problem . 
  ageing society with few workers and many pensioners is a problem ( or will be ) . 
  czikago ( or szikago , depends how you pronounce it ) . 
  but it 's not translated , only few cities have polish exonyms . 
  and i know few of them . 
  and i live in eu near border with ukraine . 
  this subreddit is n't representative . 
  because money , working in uk legaly , better infrastructure , less coruption , etc. 
  and i do n't think they want to get rid of independence . 
  most of the eu supporters want to have independent country that 's just in eu . 
   much of its population believes that they should join the european union , and not stay as an independent country . 
  you do n't really understand ukrainians , 
  [ lublin ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajuc00/7992068171/ ) [ full size ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/78731887.jpg ) i like historical sylines . 
  and i 'm biased , but so what . 
  there are probably some conspiracies we do n't know about , but there are much more things that could be explained by both conspiracy and natural causes ( like incompetence ) . 
  so each time the probability that this time it 's conspiracy is much smaller , than the probability , that it 's not . 
  besides conspiracies on the scale of many countries , many ruling coalitions that are n't uncovered seems very improbable . 
  too much improbable things would have to happen for this . 
  there are more plausible explanations : politicians are n't good economists , and they do n't listen to good economists , and economists do n't always know aht will happen , and when politicians are in opposition they will say whatever to hurt the other party . 
  and there are some policies that benefit one country and hurt another ( germany i 'm looking at you ) . 
  no need for conspiracy . 
  yeah . 
  `` never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . '', 
  it 's per capita , and poland have n't updated population stats recently , so we have about 1-2 000 000 people more on paper than in reality ( these that migrated to uk/ireland/germany etc ) . 
  the graphs that show how well poland is doing usually show total gdp growth , and not per capita . 
  total gdp growth 2007-2012 for comparison : http://lh6.ggpht.com/-w-4p0ma0ac0/ujdmfuovoui/aaaaaaaaxpy/lhcdeeaz0e8/image_thumb%25255b4%25255d.png?imgmax=800 source : http://stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/oz_sytu_makroek_w_pl_w_2012_na_tle_proce_w_gospo_swiat_.pdf, 
  they can surprise anschluss you every second , but when they tell you this gun will be working for 20 years you better believe it . 
  tbh i do n't remember when was last time i bought something from usa . 
  all the things you say are your opinions , just like all the things i say are my opinions , i do n't see a difference between saying `` patriotism is inherently evil '' and `` i think patriotism is inherently evil '' . 
  the `` i think '' at the begining is redundant . 
  i also do n't understand how you can think that `` x is inherently evil , but people doing x are not worse than people not doing x because of that '' . 
  if something is inherently evil then surely it 's better not to do that ? 
  btw how it is politcal view when you see something as evil ? 
  politic is n't about good and evil - morality is . 
  regarding being proud to be a woman - i 've seen people declare that on tv shows and in newspapers and nobody cares . 
  but if you declare yourself as a patriot some people call you nazi the next second . 
  i thought it was for attacking like bulls , 
  you also can not decide if you are born male or female , yet being `` proud to be a women '' is ok apparently . 
  and yes - you can change your gender/sex/whatever after birth , just like you can change your country after birth . 
  you get to decide ( chang or not ) so you can be proud of it . 
  and even if you are wrong in being proud of something - does it really deserve ostracism ? 
  i do n't like groupthinking , and modern pc is exactly this . 
  let people be proud of whatever they want to , it 's their choice . 
  only when they are assholes - react . 
  no need to preemptively ostracise people for thinking in different ways just because it may lead to something evil . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports just european countries ( mistakes are mine ) : 3 germany $ 1,460,000,000,000 2012 est. 
  10 united kingdom $ 474,600,000,000 2012 est. 
  15 switzerland $ 333,400,000,000 2012 est. 
  63 greece $ 28,310,000,000 2012 est. 
  124 bosnia and herzegovina $ 3,306,000,000 2012 est. 
  i think both are accetable and both are n't translated as `` nigger '' . 
  please . 
  i live here . 
  tbh being in eu has also costs ( for example polish law was already complex , and because of eu requirements it become even more so , also the amount of bueraucrats employed grows steadily since 2004 , governments always blame that on `` eu standards and laws '' , and it may even be partly true . 
  there are some problems with more costly electricity , export to ukraine/belarus/russia which is very profitable ( even if also very unreliable ) source of income , and which was much more important for poland in nineties , and much easier before we 've choosen eu and the tarrifs went up on both sides . 
  many polish companies were closed because of eu laws ( for example sugar production quotas forced most of polish sugar factories to default , and now poland imports most of the sugar from germany and farmers had to choose something different to grow , now it 's similar with tobbaco ) . 
  eu also forced poles to build the stuff that was financed by it using very strict ecological standards , more strict than most of western motorways use , that caused polish motorways to be much more costly than was nessesary ( on the other hand animals have it easier to cross the roads ) . 
  also the mass emigration to uk was n't a one-sided thing . 
  it was good for job office and because of remmitances , but it also made polish population and internal market smaller , inflation bigger , and the demographic prospects are n't exactly bright . 
  overall eu is still obviously better choice for poland , but it 's certainly not 3 % of gdp if you count the costs as well . 
  are you 100 % sure `` murzyn '' translates as `` nigger '' ? 
  cause this word alone will make most people reading your post concentrate on whether you are racist or not instead on what you wanted to say . 
  anyway - thanks to evil eu and evil polish state providing you free education that make you competive on eu labour market you are free to migrate to greener pastures . 
  if not you can stay in poland slowly getting richer . 
  at no point in last 300 years poland was better off ( in relation to other countries of the time ) . 
  for most countries that are now rich and were poor ( like south korea or japan ) getting rich took more than 20 years , and huge investment from foreign countries . 
  this happens in poland right now . 
  why exactly are you complaining ? 
  sobieski as a villian . 
  that 's interesting , 
  we have old saing `` during king olbracht rules , the ( polish ) nobility went extinct '' that refers to that time our king wanted to attack turks through moldavia ( that was his vasal at the time ? 
  ) , but ended fighting against both stephen and turks and losing .
