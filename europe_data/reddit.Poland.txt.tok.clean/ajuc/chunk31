  not many poles know what exactly this saying refers to , and many do n't even know that saying , but it 's usually mentioned on the history lessons ( at least i 've heard it both in primary and in middle school ) . 
  it 's highly overrated . 
  same experience . 
  i was on a small trip in ahlbeck from \u015awinouj\u015bcie in 2008 . 
  never cosidered trip to germany again . 
  imho nothing beats [ `` b\u00f3g si\u0119 rodzi '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l066nwwgqtw ) . 
  it 's like a carol , a hymn and a battle cry in one  also the only song that all men in the church sing , and the ground is shaking  . 
  that was always my favorite part of the pasterka . 
  the melody was used previously for polish kings ' coronation ceremony . 
  i thought about that book http://literat.ug.edu.pl/ksiegi/004.htm by adam mickiewicz . 
  ( famous polish poet of xix century , he was very talented , wrote a book considered polish national epos , was also quite good mathemathician and conspirator ) . 
  when he was old he become very weird , started something between national movement and a religious cult . 
  that book was intended to be a bible for this cult . 
  translation of a fragment for flavour : through wounds , tears and martyrdom of all the slaved , expelled and pilgriming poles save us , lord for a general war for the freedom of nations we beg you , lord similar cults were quite popular among nobility , and of course there were many more reasonable movements , but the belief that poland is like christ of nations , that is tormented for others , and will raise from death was quite strong . 
  it had also something to do with jewish mythology - jewish minority in poland was very big and had strong links to nobles . 
  and , surprisingly - the history worked out roughly along the lines they prayed for , 
  yep . 
  many poles prayed for a world war since half of the 19th century . 
  now it seems a little strange , but in the context it made sense . 
  i remember . 
  it sounds like someone speaking with his mouth full of food . 
  all these vovels and no consonants . 
  polish : - pies ( dog ) - piesek ( little dog ) - pieseczek/piesuniek ( even smaller dog ) - piesunieczek ( really , really , really small dog ) - psisko ( a big dog ) etc. 
  show me something like this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenin's_hanging_order done in tsarist russia . 
  as a pole i do n't particulary like tsar , but communists took it to another level . 
  there were a few revolutions , the first one wanted regular democracy and not crazy utopia bloodbath . 
  if not for lenin and his friends russia could have become democratic country . 
  why would anybody like lenin ? 
  andropov , as a chief of kgb says to his friend : - when i 'll be general secretary i 'll do away with these damn timezones . 
  so many troubles . 
  i 've called to china to congratulate deng xiaoping being choosen to rule the country and they said it was yesterday . 
  today i 've called vatican to give them my condolences because of the pope assasination , and they ask `` what assasination ? 
  in the newspaper there was a photo of first secretary gomu\u0142ka visiting collective farm in some village , looking at the pigs in a new pigsty . 
  the subscription says : towarzysz gomu\u0142ka visiting new pigsty ( first to the right ) . 
  why people stand up on official occasions when people shout `` bierut !, 
  to not sit ( in polish slang it also means to not go to jail ) . 
  priest had a parrot that always said `` kill stalin '' . 
  eventually somebody heard it , told someone else and the priest was in the court . 
  the priest tried to persuade the judge that it was the parrot not him , but the parrot was n't speaking . 
  first the priest asked the parrot ''  kill stalin < '' , then the judge , then the whole room . 
  then the parrot sings `` lord jesus , hear us , how the people are begging '' ( line from a very popular polish church song ) . 
  in 1968 after `` dziady '' spectacle polish government delegation was in moscow . 
  chruszczow says to gomu\u0142ka : - so i heard you had antisoviet spectacle in theather - yes , `` dziady '' - says gomu\u0142ka looking at the floor - so what have you done with that ? 
  - banned the spectacle . 
  - good , what about the director ? 
  - fired . 
  - good . 
  and the writer ? 
  - he 's dead . 
  - hmm , little harsh , do n't you think ? 
  ( mickiewicz was dead in xix century already ) . 
  kid runs to his dad shouting : - dad , dad , russians flew to space !, 
  - all of them ? 
  - no , just 3 . 
  - so what 's the big deal ? 
  you do n't have dresiarze ? 
   offensive stereotyping or accurate satire ?? 
  is n't that the same ? 
  cobol is actually very marketable skill . 
  you know it you can dictate your salary to the unfortunate companies that still use it . 
  your only competition are 70 y.o. 
  guys that will retire in a few months . 
  kids in poland know that the only way for a good life is to be really good in what they do , or to migrate to the west . 
  that 's the difference imho . 
  regarding cheating - it 's bad , but it 's preparing for life better than some of the stuff that kids need to learn , repeat and forget . 
  to this day i remember how they forced me to remember how much banana each country exports per year . 
  that was exercise in `` system does n't make sense , rules are pointless , find a way around them or suffer '' . 
  that 's important lesson . 
  i do n't advocate for ukrainians to adopt latin script , i just do n't agree that slavic languages are better written in cyrylic ( common argument by cyrylic-script slavic countries ) . 
  it 's all about what you 're more used to . 
  for me kyjiv looks ok ( well , you could perhaps write it kyjiw  ) . 
  regarding '' \u0105 '' and '' \u0119 '' - yup - people drop these in sms messages , but in the end it does n't matter . 
  s_e wh_t i me_n ? 
  natural language is redundant . 
  actually it makes the language richer - you can vary how `` upright '' you want to sound - casual texts can drop the tails ( it 's like writing l33t in english ) , in proper texts you use the right letters , and if you want to make fun of somebody you can overuse the tails ( it 's a popular meme in polish - people that ca n't write properly often overuse tails when they try to write/speak properly cause they do n't know where to use '' \u0119 '' and where to use `` en '' or `` e '' - it sounds `` redneck trying too hard '' when you do this ) . 
  there 's some potential for mistakes ( `` zr\u00f3b mi \u0142ask\u0119 '' means `` do me a favor '' , `` zr\u00f3b mi lask\u0119 '' means `` give me a blowjob '' , `` zrob mi laske '' can be interpreted as both ) , but in practice it does n't matter . 
  as long as we do n't go the english way and use phonetic scripts we 're ok . 
  i do n't think shorter words = better alphabet . 
  if that was the case then the chinese alphabet is much better than ukrainian  there 's value in having the same basic letters across many nations , and latin alphabet is better than cyrylica in that regard ( and i wo n't even speak about ascii and computer-related problems ) . 
  and there 's value in having less letters , but being able to form variations of them using rules ( if you do n't agree switch to chineese ) . 
  all scripts choose some point on the spectrum between one sign = many words , and many signs = one sound , i do n't think you can claim your script is better just because of its position on that scale . 
  oh , and btw polish alphabet has 32 letters too , and we have a few more sounds than ukrainians ( for example '' \u0142 '' , '' \u0105 '' , '' \u0119 '' , '' \u017a '' and `` d\u017a '' ) . 
  czechs are western slaves too , and they have these c and s with ^ instead , for me it makes no difference . 
  germans have `` sch '' , anglophones have `` sh '' and `` ch '' , why `` sz '' and `` cz '' is worse ? 
  what 's wrong with western slavic orthographies ? 
  why do you need space with one and not with the other ? 
  i do n't see how $ 10 is possible and 10 $ is n't . 
  and why not $ 10 ? 
  americans use imperial system , and write dates as month day year . 
  i would n't try to emulate them on such matters . 
  why would you place the sign before the value , if you say `` ten euro '' and not `` euro ten '' ? 
  you are free to move to one of the few remaining communis countries . 
  that was n't true for the people of the communist countries in xx century europe that wanted to try capitalism for change ( they could n't leave ) . 
  if you want to know which place is better look for who forbids to enter , and who forbids to leave . 
  you can and you should , if you did the right thing and saved during the boom . 
  electrical network must be balanced at all times . 
  balancing should be idealy never done - it 's only needed when people estimate their production/consumption incorrectly . 
  each day powerplants operators , network operators and the biggest consumers ( operators of sub-networks that deliver power to regular people/factories etc ) trade power/transfer capabilities/etc on `` next day energy market '' . 
  then they send that to the main network operator , and he optimizes the transfers according to all the constraints , then sends them the optimized plans back . 
  if everybody predicted correctly it 's all that needs to be done .
