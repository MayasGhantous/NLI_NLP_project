  there 's also `` balancing capabilities market '' , where powerplants offer `` i can stop my 2 power blocks tommorow betwen 14:00 -17:00 that should be working according to previous plan , if you pay me x money '' or `` i can engage 2 more powerblocks tommorow if you pay me 50 % more for that energy '' . 
  thanks to that market the main network operator can react when somebody predicted wrongly , or something surprising happens . 
  he just uses these balancing capabilities that powerplants offered yesterday . 
  balancing means network operator tells some powerplants to shut down a few blocks there and there , routes energy differently than it was planned ( it almost always means `` less efficiently '' ) , in the worst case disconnects some consumers altogether ( blackouts ) . 
  it is costly , sometimes even dangerous . 
  the main rule of energy networks is - he who predicted wrongly ( consumption or production , in plus or in minus - does n't matter ) - pays for the balancing effort that this causes . 
  germany now is n't paying for using polish network as a storage for their surpluss energy . 
  it 's not a matter of different technology , backwardness or anything like that . 
  if every country on earth tried to dump their unpredictable surpluses on neighbors like germany - the earth network would be unbalanced as a whole ( so it would often shut down ) . 
  i wonder who paid for that article . 
  another article about this , slightly less biased : http://www.icis.com/heren/articles/2011/12/12/9515924/germany-faces-struggle-to-balance-electricity-system-as-loop-flows.html  a lack of grid investments has pushed germany to use neighbouring grids for balancing , the german energy agency has warned . 
  so-called phase shifters targeting loop flows on the polish border could make the german grid more unstable and make new investments urgent , according to the agency . 
  `` when excess wind and solar power can not be discharged abroad , then the german power grid will become unstable , '' stephan kohler , head of the german energy agency , said in german daily der spiegel last week . 
   poland has two power lines to germany , allowing 1.1 gw of exports and 2.0 gw of imports . 
  in the past , there have been problems with loop flows on the interconnectors which cause congestion on the border points and are difficult to manage . 
   this creates a situation where wind power from germany is routed through poland and the czech republic , which in essence means that germany is using its neighbours to balance its power system . 
  sehr-ruhig-federation ( germany , luxembourg , poland , austria , hungary , czech republic , slovakia ) this one would be fun to watch falling apart . 
  uk deal with that before it 's too late . 
  then they evolve to hussars . 
  when the whole europe unites the hitler will be back . 
  that explains many things . 
  in polish both mead and honey is called `` mi\u00f3d '' . 
  sometimes mead is called `` mi\u00f3d pitny '' ( drinkable honey ) . 
  germany was n't a core of cold-war europe , it was a border . 
  poles would unite ireland , take over the government , and immadiately start civil war against each other , causing not 2 , but 10 small independent polih-irish states to emerge . 
  i think it was politics more than economics . 
  it was the state that was the front during the cold war . 
  both usa and ussr tried to make it as prosperous , as possible - to prevent any social unrest that could start serious problems ( imagine for a moment that west treated germany like many people during ww2 demanded - basicaly erasing it from the map . 
  how probable is that this would cause uprisings in western germany demanding to be joined with the eastern one , and how much trouble could this cause to nato etc ) . 
  besides it was great policital marketing : look how much better our germans do than their germans !, 
  capitalism/communism is obviously better !, 
  so , maybe we could take care of belfast for you guys ? 
  read the next sentence . 
  putin decides what the whole eu eats each month , 
  back in the nineties it was disco polo . 
  now it cross-mutated with hip-hop and i do n't really know how to call it . 
  also it 's kitsch . 
  but there was no better songs in that contest . 
  but have you choosen something like [ that ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytdhmzdkois ) for your national football team song ? 
  nope , by special treatment i mean usa allowed germany to grow by buying its goods , and gave the money to make it possible . 
  it was motivated by politics , but eu is too . 
  and it 's not a guarantee of fast growth - germans had to do their part , that 's why there are still differences between old eu countries . 
  i 'm not accusing germany , i 'm saying it 's strange to critique poland for taking money and exporting stuff when most countries did the same a few decades ago to grow . 
  i mean - not only the other points fit . 
  germany got money and favourable trading conditions when it was growing , too . 
  they are now giving money out , but do n't compare poland to modern germany , compare it to germany of ' 60 - ' 80 . 
  ever heard of marshall plan ? 
  also we 're not major power . 
  we 're regional average , and that 's ok . 
  why is nobody shouting ? 
  first thing - we had some years without deficit in the last 20 years . 
  regarding the debt decrease - i think it 's the result of po private pension cash grab ( so called 2nd pillar ) . 
  will give them a few years more at the cost of destroying half of our pension system . 
  good job . 
  right , somehow i thought we speak about the north pole . 
  floating object displaces as much water , as it weights itself . 
  so if you drop ice cube in a jar of fresh water , cover the jar , mark the level before and after the ice cube melted - there should n't be a diffference . 
  hovewer salt water is more dense than fresh water , so when you dilute it with the clean water from ice it takes up more space . 
  but it 's very mnor effect , the difference in density is small . 
  it 's not bad actually . 
  more beaches , better weather , better wines . 
  1 . it 's much cheaper 2 . it 's tradition in poland and everybody are used to it 3 . it preserves the original actors voices unlike dubbing 4 . it 's less distracting than subtitles , ater you get used to it, 
  it 's aquired taste - after a while your brain combines the original voices with polish meaning . 
  you must pay attentiont to even notice the lektor after you get used to it . 
  imagine this - morgan freeman speaking in polish  i still prefer this over dubbing . 
  subtitles are even better , but they too have disadvantages ( more distracting ) . 
  to be honest polish historic movies are still more faithful to the truth than hollywood historic movies  but yeah , 95 % of modern polish movies suck . 
  search youtube for `` film lektor pl '' if you do n't believe me ( or want to see how it works ) . 
  poles are used to this , after a few years you `` combine on the fly '' the lektor and actor voices and it 's almost like they all speak in their original voices in polish . 
  almost all foreign tv series , shows , movies etc are done that way . 
  in cinemas it 's less popular lately , but in tv it 's still going strong . 
  in my opinion subtitles   lector   dubbing . 
  in poland most movies are `` with lector '' which means the original voices are a little quieter , and one guy reads all the lines in polish . 
  they compared ranks with textual sorting - so in high proficiency section results are in wrong order ( or the numbers are wrong ) . 
  8 and 9 should be before 10-17, 
  yep , we export human resources , 
  niemcy means `` mutes '' and comes from the time when all slavs could understand each other , and could n't understand germans - closest neighbors that were n't slavs . 
  so people who you could understand were slavs ( s\u0142owianie = people of word ) , and the others were niemcy ( mutes ) . 
  w\u0142ochy ( pronounced vwohy ) comes from old slavic `` volh '' which meant `` people of roman origins '' . 
  edit : and apparently it comes from old tribe of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volcae,

  belive or not - poles are complaining too , 
  source : ( in polish ) http://forsal.pl/artykuly/743210,kryzys-gospodarczy-w-europie-jaki-jest-bilans-gospodarczego-kataklizmu.html related article in english : http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief/4291621-poland-eu-leader, 
  without privacy your freedom of opinion or expression depends on present you trusting all future goverenments and powerful corporations to not take advantage of your current opinions . 
  his example was quite good - in fifties it was controversial to support minority rights in many supposedly progressive countries . 
  if everybody knew that their every conversation on phone or in mail probably is recorded and stored - would that persuade at least some people not to support these minorities in mail or by phone ? 
  i guess that it would , and that means freedom is indeed constrained by lack of privacy . 
  during communism most often censorship did n't needed to do anything - people feared to say stuff that could be dangerous , so they did n't even tried to . 
  it 's called `` autocensorship '' , and if it lasts for too long - it makes people train themselves not to even think about stuff they ca n't say . 
  it 's very insidious , vaclav havel wrote a lot about this effect . 
  related question - in english `` i '' is always capital letter , and you ca n't skip it for the sentence to make sense . 
  in polish `` ja '' is usually skipped , and it uses capital letter only if it 's the first word in the sentence . 
  how does it work in other languages ? 
  both organisation and buildings , but organisation has capital c. 
  yes , all ~ ~ slaves ~ ~ slavs have variation of `` honey - eater '' , and we have `` not a d\u017awied\u017a '' . 
  edit : stupid english, 
  the original spelling was `` cucum-bear '', 
  polish : `` motyl '' . 
  in polish it 's the same - orthodox church is `` cerkiew '' , catholic church is `` ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 '' . 
  many times .
