  it 's much easier to find a job , and salaries are 50 % -100 % bigger than in lublin . 
  other big cities ( krak\u00f3w , gda\u0144sk , wroc\u0142aw ) place between warsaw and lublin , closer to lublin than to warsaw . 
  there 's ok public transport in most big cities ( in lublin 80 euro buys you 150-day ticket valid for all buses and trolleys in the city , in warsaw it 's a little more expnasive , but there 's metro and city trains ) , fuel is expansive , and driving culture is `` special '' - at first better to use public transport . 
  i do n't trust eu as much as my national institutions . 
  specifically - i do n't trust majority of eu citizens have the same interests as me regarding most of the matters that currently countries decide by themselves . 
  making eu more democratic wo n't help - it would be dictatorship of majority . 
  few of the most populous countries will decide everything for the rest . 
  i much prefer eu to be mostly about trade and traveling . 
  euro was already stretching it , and we got burned . 
  no reason to do more . 
  this . 
  it 's insane . 
  my wife got a medicament prescribed recently , it had huge label `` homeopathy '' on it . 
  of course i 've entered `` rant mode '' about how homeopathy does n't work and how a medic can prescribe such bullshit . 
  then i 've checked the ingredients , and the active ingredient was over 1 or 5 % of the solution : / it 's gotten to the point that non-homeopathic drugs are labeled `` homeopathy '' so people will buy them . 
  and nobody actually bothers checking out what this homeopathy is supposed to mean . 
  it 's used roughly as `` herbal '' or `` natural '' . 
  mountains on eastern and western border . 
  it 's easy . 
  how do you call all people living in northern america ? 
  there 's no convenient name for that , because usa citizens use that name for themselves . 
  it 's stupid and inconvenient , and we should n't make the same mistake by using europe as synonym for eu or even eurozone ( i 've seen that happening already in this subreddit ) . 
  so you wish another war on europe and it 's the nationalists that are evil , 
  easy - everything except pronunciation . 
  hard - no relationship at all between how the word looks and sounds . 
  i think he must say more and more outrageous stuff to get attention . 
  it 's a little sad . 
  maybe in silesia  architecture in modern central and eastern poland ( which for the most of polish history was also central poland ) is very different from german . 
  see old city in warsaw , krak\u00f3w , lublin , przemy\u015bl , zamo\u015b\u0107 , sandomierz , rzeszow.that 's how most of the commonwealth looked like . 
  more italian with slavic twist , than german . 
  the parts that do have german architecture are either multicultural polish-german areas like silesia , or was n't even polish 80 years ago  regarding words i think facts are obvious . 
  8 pages of german words in polish : http://slownik-wyrazowobcych.eu/tag/niemiecki/ compare to 38 pages of latin words in polish : http://slownik-wyrazowobcych.eu/tag/lacina/ we even have grammar system similar to latin ( 6 or 7 cases , like polish , when german has 4 ) . 
  we do n't do the `` die/der/das '' business . 
  one point for using german `` w '' instead of `` v '' , though . 
  half of the scientific , political , legal , medical and such terms are from latin . 
  from german we have mostly mechanical words ( and even there half of them are from french ) political tradition of rzeczpospolita is taken stright from roman res publica . 
  our institutions are based on latin . 
  compare political systems - completely different . 
  we sometimes `` borrowed '' some things from germany , but on much shallower level . 
  i remain convinced latin influences are much more important than german ( but of course 10 % is still big influences ) . 
  regarding jewish influences vs german influences - how much do you know about jewish mythology and how much do you know about german  ? 
  because i bet you recognise more than 30 heroes from jewish mythology , and from german you probably only know odyn , thor and loki  and not much details about them . 
  the whole concept of `` poland as a mesiah of nations '' that was central to poland during partitions is stolen from jewish culture . 
  it 's very effective meme btw - it allowed poles to survive 200 years of occupation with 20 years pause , and for jews it worked for almost 2000 years . 
  shame that it comes with a little skewed worldview , but it can be fixed now that we 're independent . 
  the law is there because of religion , so whatever . 
  also sometimes if you 're not in eurozone you 're not european . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but in poland everybody had family in usa or canada or uk , and these people had sent packages with food , cloths , sweets etc to poland ( mostly through catholic church ) so everybody knew the west is more wealthy . 
  after ww2 there was also a small-scale guerilla war against communists . 
  part of the guerilla groups that during ww2 fought against germans continued to do so against communists after the faked elections . 
  last of such guerilla fighters was only killed in 1963 . 
  more info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cursed_soldiers of course most people just lived their lives , and were happy that at least the regular war is over , and that they some place to live and some job . 
  in the 70s when gierek got big credits in the west and started investments there was even small boom in economy . 
  but the investments were n't profitable and it all collapsed in 80s . 
  hence solidarity , maritial law , and last 10 years of communism was basically small group of communists ruling falling apart country where everybody hated them . 
  at least since 60s-70s . 
  we had westerns in cinemas , everybody wanted to buy jeans , jazz was very popular , blues and rock 'n' roll too . 
  usa was enemy of ussr and most poles hated ussr , and it 's hard to completely close a country against such cultural influences . 
  we 've had hippies and punks . 
  i 'd say poland is : - 25 % slavic culture ( unique polish as well as universal slavic stuff ) - 20 % roman culture ( concepts , law , religion and words borrowed from latin ) - 15 % rusian/ruthenian ( words , architecture , our traditional enemy ) - 10 % jewish ( concepts , words , commons , mythology , half of great poles were jewish ) - 10 % german ( words , architecture , machines , fighting with them since 972 ) - 10 % french ( during age of enlightenment all new ideas came to poland from france , chopin and maria sk\u0142odowska-curie are our common heroes , we helped napoleon and still consider him to be the good guy ) - 5 % italian ( during renneisance we got all new stuff through italy . 
  we had italian queen then , italian painters and architects were all the rage then , we got words for many architectural and musical stuff from italian , as well as for most of vegetables  ) - 5 % usa ( modern influences , only important in last 50 years , but quickly rising ) hard to choose from british , german , french because these cultures are very similar , and only represent small part of european cultural spectrum . 
  poland : http://www.opifex.com.pl/db/gallery/17e394f38d.jpg, 
  they make these green sweets - i do n't know how they are called in ukrainian , poles often buy 1 kg bags of these and sell it in poland on street markets and they call it `` szypuszki '' . 
  great stuff . 
  compiled in 2010 . 
  data is `` most recent '' . 
  usually statistics are available with some delay . 
  it may be that data is from 2009 , or even 2005 . 
  i wonder how recent the data is , though . 
  maybe it 's from before 2007 ? 
  actually we have fertility rate of 1.32 , much smaller than russia with 1.61 : /, 
  poland : if a region has over 20 % minority people can put bilingual signs there . 
  krak\u00f3w is the single most popular tourist destination in poland . 
  all have great architecture , much less tourists and are cheaper than krak\u00f3w .

  i guess the man with a gun was against categorical imperative . 
  you are pro-euro and therefore perceive pro-euro posts as objective and neutral , and anti-euro posts as outrageous ( and remember them more vividly ) . 
  so you think there 's this bias . 
  for people anti-euro it works the other way so they think that everything has the pro-euro bias and their `` counterattack '' is justified in their minds . 
  that 's how politics and group instinct influences people . 
   it 's the first game i 've played on pc . 
  we 've been going to neighbor that had 386 in the evenings to play this and prince of persia . 
  it 's not so bad in poland , actually . 
  and we would have much better weather . 
  had to look this up . 
  it 's `` l\u00e9nkija '' , and it comes from the tribe of `` l\u0119dzianie '' that lived there , and that word comes probably from `` l\u0119da '' , or `` scorched land '' , so it 's about burning forests too  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_poland#other now i 'm sad that english name for poland is n't `` scorchedlandia '' or sth like that . 
  would be cool . 
   in july of 2011 , a court in belarus fined a one-armed man for taking part in unsanctioned `` clapping '' protests in minsk . 
  the man was found guilty by the court of clapping in a public place . 
  the fact that the man was clapping was proved by one of the witnesses during the trial . 
  i think it would lead to another world wars . 
  countries without colonies would lose importance , so everybody would hurry up to get their share . 
  and china would n't allow that cause it has interests in africa . 
  my question : . . if population growth in developing countries ( and worldwide too , in effect ) stopped ? 
  yep . 
  as opposed to the primal forest that was all around when we came here . 
  fields were made by burning parts of the forest and people that settled there called themselves `` people of the fields '' = polanie . 
  fun fact . 
  pole means `` field '' in polish . 
  whatever .
