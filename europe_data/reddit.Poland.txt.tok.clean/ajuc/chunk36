  also primary school in poland had 8 years then . 
   on 16 . march old ss soldiers honors their fallen friends how is honoring ss soldiers not pro-nazi ? 
  why not multiply by 2 , square , divide by four ? 
  i considered asking them for kosher food , 
  i can only speak from my experience as a tourist in germany . 
  many of them changed their attitude when they hear polish . 
  uk or ireland , actually . 
  germans do n't like poles , and everybody know english , only some poles know german . 
  it 's funny how people have different rights depending on when they migrated to the country . 
  good to be a german minority in poland . 
  they have special priviledges in polish elections - their party do n't have to pass support level of 5 % to be in parliament , like regular parties , and now they can vote in german elections too . 
  cause they are not nationalists , or at least not all of them ( and not all nationalists are hools ) . 
  they can be easily faked , of course ( and i admit i 've quoted the most outrageous comment ) . 
  on the other hand people express more openly when using pseudonyms , so you can get pretty good idea of public opinion on some matter by reading many online commens . 
  of course this is english-language article so it 's skewed sample . 
  i 'm interested . 
  see comments under the article for russian opinion  my favorite :  ukraine is headed towards reunification with russia !, 
  same people , religion and mentality command this , and no bought off western crooks will changr that !, 
   ps : belarus and kazakhstan will reunite with russia too , either voluntarily or with brutal force !, 
  well , my bad . 
  this is about eastern partnership and not joining eu . 
  `` civilised direction '', 
  great , but we will celebrate after it 's signed . 
  no , because you can export outside your currency union . 
  countries outside currency union with other countries are currency unions on their own , and some of them are more competitive than others . 
  according to your theory they would all have same competitiveness of 0 . 
  yes , but only if we can develop at our pace for next 20 years , and we deal with demographic problems before they get serious , and there 's no crisis that actually touches us in the meantime . 
  that 's many conditions , and entering eurozone in next 5-10 years will make it all much more risky for us , as well as make it hard to keep competive advantages we currently have ( being cheap so we could export , and having small prices so we have reasonable internal consumption ) . 
  if we enter eurozone and there 's another crisis we either do internal devaluation like baltics ( internal consumption goes to hell , and we take 10 % gdp drop ) , or stop doing ok with exports . 
  that 's why almost nobody in poland wants euro in the short term . 
  if euro was only in green countries there would be no problems ( or only in countries with the same color ) . 
  and people still advocate for poland to join eurozone : /, 
  russian : czaj, 
  never heard that you should do that . 
  but some people say it 's better to take the cold water for drinking , because the hot has some chlor added ( if it 's transported hot from the city powerplant i mean , if you 're warming it in your house it makes no difference ) . 
  the water is safe to drink in poland as well ( except in warsaw  ) , and we have mixer taps . 
  the obvious solution is for eu to mandate that all sinks should have 3 taps , 
  first we speak about culture , and now it 's about ethnic cleansing ? 
  that 's 2 different things imho . 
  regarding forced assimilation of occupied people : poles also have their own culture too , and we endured over 100 years of russification and germanization . 
  actually we must have had it better than irish , cause almost nobody speak irish in ireland , and practicaly all poles speak polish . 
  people there think you only need too cold or too hot water . 
  how would you call what english did in ireland then ? 
  if you want real politic pov , there you are : `` good relations '' and `` bad relations '' does n't mean anything in politics . 
  especially with russia . 
  you do n't `` do sth to show your good will and benefit later '' . 
  that does n't work . 
  their negotiators will laugh at you afterwards . 
  you can negotiate , and trade , but every time you get something from russia , you must give something else . 
  that 's the first rule . 
  so giving up on something for free is just stupid . 
  you lose possible trading material for nothing . 
  you do n't need this small country in the middle of nowhere , but they want it ? 
  you do n't give it up for free - you trade it for as much as you can . 
  now - is the thing we want from russia more important for eu than ukraine is for russia ? 
  imho no . 
  according to these http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/113459.htm data from 2012 : as a whole , european union is ukraine 's biggest export ( 21.8 % ) and import ( 39.9 % ) partner , followed by russia ( 20.7 % and 10.1 % respectively ) . 
  however if you add kazakhstan and belarus to russia figures it 's slightly bigger export market for ukraine than eu , while still being far smaller import partner . 
  in poland you ca n't cut a tree without local government agreement , even if it is on your property : / regarding the forests most are still national ( meaning you can go there and pick berries or mushrooms ) , and surprisingly the national company that manages the forests is doing well - there 's more trees each year , and they are very profitable for a national company . 
  not worse than lenin , that 's for sure , 
  maybe you should ask ukrainians instead of deciding for them ? 
  i mean as a german you should know well how it feels to be `` given '' to another country because of geopolitics . 
  she was jailed because of politics , but she probably is guilty ( at least all the ukrainians i 've spoken with think so ) . 
  hard to decide . 
  regarding galicia and volynia - it was a consequence of the treaty semen petlura ( as a leader of ukrainian people 's republic ) signed with poland in 1920 in exchange poland was to help him defend ukraine from soviet russia with which ukraine was at war at that time . 
  soviet russia annexed the rest of ukraine shortly after , btw . 
  more here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semen_petlura#1920, 
  not at all . 
  russia is actually good at real politic - it uses both carrot ( cheap gas , small tariffs , no controls on the border ) and a stick ( ban on exports , high prices for gas ) . 
  just like eu do ( but we 're much less focused on ukraine , and much worse at the real politic than russia ) . 
  imho eu is better option for ukraine than russia in the long term , but i can understand ukrainians not being sure about that . 
  yeah i know the math . 
  i just had 2 ways to reason about this , that were contradicting each other . 
  my 2nd ( wrong ) reasoning was : - at first country a has bigger absolute growth - bigger absolute growth means country a remains bigger than country b after the growth - which means absolute growth will be still bigger for country a - by induction country b will never catch up 3rd point is not true of course - at some point country a will still have bigger gdp than country b , but the absolute growth will be bigger for country b knowing that something should work , and being persuaded are 2 different things , 
  that 's very nonintuitive , even if you know the math , because for example with countries : - a ( gdp 1000 , growth 1 % ) - b ( gdp 100 , growth 2 % ) at first absolute growth will be smaller in country b ( +2 vs +10 in country a ) , but it will eventually turn around . 
  i had to check for myself , even though i knew it should work that way , 
   it would turn out german cars are 90 % made in eastern europe and china, 
  everything is `` epickie '' ( epic ) now , while polish had this word for a long time it was used in different sense . 
  it changed from a word only used in discussions about literature to one of the most common words in less than 10 years . 
  nothing is `` wspania\u0142e '' anymore . 
  `` pathetic '' false friend ( patetyczny ) is used incorrectly - in polish it means roughly `` too serious '' , `` pompous '' and now it 's often used like english pathethic . 
  we have proverb `` z deszczu pod rynn\u0119 '' ( [ to hide ] from rain under the drainpipe ) . 
  it 's basically the same as english `` jump out of the frying pan into the fire '' , and the polish idiom is even shorter , but still i 've heard people using translation of the english idiom ( wyskoczy\u0107 z patelni w ogie\u0144 ) . 
  we also have `` zamieni\u0142 stryjek siekierk\u0119 na kijek '' ( uncle swapped an axe for a stick ) which is similar and rhymes . 
  '' [ by\u0107 ] mi\u0119dzy m\u0142otem a kowad\u0142em '' ( [ to be ] between an anvil and a hammer ) is basically `` to be between a rock and a hard place '' , and i 've heard this literally translated to polish too as `` by\u0107 mi\u0119dzy kamieniem a czym\u015b twardym '' and it sounds stupid . 
  i 've seen people write sarcastically on internet boards in such way : '' \u015awietny pomys\u0142 . 
  nie '' which is direct translation of `` that 's a great idea . 
  not '' . 
  nie '' ( you 're such a hero . 
  not ) . 
  in english it 's common , in polish it sounds completely off , `` nie '' does n't work that way , all words would change if there was contradiction at the end , but still people do it . 
  other phrases : - `` dom modowy '' , `` pokaz modowy '' ( fashion house , fashion show ) , 10 years ago it was `` dom mody '' and `` pokaz mody '' - `` wyprzeda\u017c '' and `` przecena '' are almost extinct , it 's `` sale '' now, 
  to all the poeple saying `` ukraine you 're welcome to eu '' : talk is cheap . 
  there 's this eastern partnership initiative going right now , and many countries ( especially the `` old eu '' ) oppose it , because ukraine is keeping tymoshenko in prison . 
  it 's stupid - it allows ukraine president to say to ukrainians - `` they do n't want us , our only choice is russia '' . 
  tymoshenko is just a pretext and it benefits current government of ukraine to keep her in prison exactly because eu is making problems because of that . 
  besides - regular ukrainians are affraid that after hypothethical accession their industry would be overrun by eu , and they would be reduced to `` colonial '' state - huge market for eu and source of cheap labour that western companies will use . 
  they know they can sell stuff to russia ( if they `` behave '' at least ) , but they do n't know whether they can sell to eu ( will eu allow their goods or ban them using one or another silly excuse , and are their goods even good enough to sell on eu market ) . 
  we should address these concerns if we want ukraine in . 
  polish - it 's not overrun ( everybody speak it rather than english ) , and language rules are intact ( or at least develop independently of english ) .
