  but it 's heavily influenced - we have many words from english , and even some proverbs/idioms are translated , when we already have polish idioms for the same thing . 
  but it 's nothing new , really - before it was french , before that italian and latin . 
  in 15th century already polish writers were complaining that `` poles are using latin and italian everywhere instead of polish to show off and it 's destroying our language '' . 
  somehow the language survived that just fine , and we got many words from these languages , so we have bigger vocabulary now and more detailed distinctions ( when we loaned words for same thing from many languages the words develop slightly different meaning , and when english have to say `` non-rechrgeable battery '' or `` rechargeable battery '' we simply use `` bateria '' and `` akumulator '' ) . 
  as long as we keep our flexion system polish is fine . 
  but yeah - it 's sometime unnerving to see english idiom `` search-and-replace '' - translated when we have polish version that makes much more sense in our language ( like `` exclusive interview '' translated as `` ekskluzywny wywiad '' - wtf ? 
  that 's not how `` ekskluzywny '' works in polish , it 's false friend ) . 
  15 years ago i lived in small village near lublin , and there were separate containers ( 5 of them ) and smaller prices for junk disposal for people that recycle . 
  of course 95 % of population ignored that system completely and just burned flamable waste during winter , used organic waste to fertilize garden , and threw away everything else to the `` other '' container . 
  the thing that was very wrong with this system was - specialized containers had small holes that you could only throw one bottle at a time . 
  so you gathered all plastic bottles in one huge sack for a month , went to the container and spent 15 minutes throwing one by one through that hole . 
  meanwhile people that did n't recycled threw everything to the general container and were done . 
  incentives were set the wrong way . 
  well then white americans should also be different race than for example scandinavians . 
  it 's stupid anyway . 
  try this and poland leaves . 
  or at least there 's referendum to leave every few months ( if gov wo n't have balls to do this ) . 
  by the way - why are mexicans considered different race ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  they can use empty elevator shaft for that , 
  in poland beer is serious business . 
  today in polish radio 3 they literally had a news about cucumbers - apparently in some belarusian city where \u0141ukaszenko comes from there is a cucumber holiday today . 
  lublin - [ union of lublin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_lublin ), 
  in most of europe during winter it 's too cold for a tent . 
  certainly in poland . 
  but i reccomend student 's camp bases in poland during summer - they are great for camping and very cheap . 
  they are open during summer ( usually june-august or september ) , you pay around $ 2 for a night in own tent , $ 3 - $ 4 for a night in rented tent , or in a house ( some bases have houses ) there 's campfire and free boiled water , some clean stream nearby for bathing , and these bases are spaced so that you can go from one to another in one day , and visit whole polish mountains , and some other places . 
  usually there 's some small village not too far , so you can buy basic food etc ( and it 's cheap , cause these places are the poorest in poland ) . 
  map of all the bases open in 2012 ( sorry , could n't find one in english ) : https://sites.google.com/a/ka.pttk.pl/www/sbn you can also camp on somebodys terrain , but you have to ask for permission first . 
  many people agree . 
  you can not camp on the tourist trails ( there are national park guards walking them quite often and they will fine you if you do ) . 
  food in poland is one of the cheapest in the whole europe , so you should n't have problems with that . 
  that is just a stereotype of poles from `` poland a '' as they like to call themselves . 
  russia : `` we 'd like to be able to blackmail our neighbors '' . 
  so very surprising . 
  wow , international trade seems to be worth it , 
  eurozone ( countries using euro ) ! = european union ( eu ), 
  of course not , there was crisis at the time . 
  but still - if slovakia had its own currency maybe it would fare better during the crisis . 
  i 've read somewhere that in middle ages slavs assigned colors to the directions , so there was `` white ruthenia '' and `` red ruthenia '' and that 's how belarus got the name . 
  found it : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cardinal_direction#cardinal_directions_in_world_cultures, 
   population movement does n't occur in the eu , crisis-affected portugese emigrated to angola , not germany https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/polish-born_people_in_employment_in_the_uk_2003-2010_-_chart_2369a_at_statistics_gov_uk.gif https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_migration_to_the_united_kingdom, 
  i remember buying cheaper stuff in slovakia on school trips in nineties . 
  certainly alcohol was cheaper , 
  have it addressed demographic problems in future ? 
  poland has zero or negative natural growth most of the time for last 20 years , and our baby boomers ( people born during eighties ) have last chance to have kids right now . 
  if not - we will have huge problems with ageing society after these people retire . 
   so the question is if poland is economically more like the older members or more like slovakia . 
  yes , and i think poland is much more similar to slovakia than to germany  assuming we aproach efficiency , competivness and purchasing power of germany - i 'm all for entering the eurozone . 
  estonia have n't even grow back to 2007 gdp per capita level yet ( 0.96 x 0.86 x 1.034 x 1.083 x 1.033 x 1.031 = 0.9846404350839936 ) . 
  no wonder they grow fast - they have the capacity already . 
  my point is - poland is doing ok , euro is a risky change , independent currency was a big asset for us during crisis - why fix what ai n't broken ? 
  compare poland and slovakia , shall we ? 
  http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdec100 slovakia entered eurozone in 2009 . year 2004\u00a02005\u00a02006\u00a02007 2008\u00a02009\u00a02010\u00a02011 2012 2013 poland 5.4 3.7 6.3 6.8 5.1 1.5 2.9 4.5 1.8 1.1 slovakia 5.0 6.6 8.3 10.4 5.6 -5.1 4.1 3.8 1.9 0.7 it 's real gdp per capita , growth rate , eur per inhabitant, 
  poland should join only when our purchasing power and competivness is at least equal to average in eurozone . 
  before that it will be doing harm to polish economy , and we will never catch up . 
  before slovakia entered they were cheaper country than poland , we were going there to buy cheap stuff . 
  now it 's the other way around . 
  and they salaries changed only a little - not as much as prices . 
  for now poland needs currency that is cheaper than euro to be competive . 
  we do n't want to become next greece or spain . 
  that 's my opinion , but it seems most poles do n't want euro now . 
  it 's obvious nonsense , but whatever , it shows common enemy and proposes convenient thing to do to feel like you react to the threat . 
  it 's the most efficient way to unify people that mankind know . 
  some poles also used `` serwus '' , but it 's old fashioned now . 
  it was popular among youth before ww2 ( or at least it looks that way from books where young people speak ) . 
  but i 'd never guess `` szia '' is `` serwus '' , 
  i do n't even care about zus - nobody in my generation believes it will be around when we will retire . 
  i just do n't want the other consequences of country that 's mostly old people - see how japan dealt with old population - 20 years of stagnation fueled by debt . 
  we do n't have the money and credit japan had , so we will deal with it much worse . 
  i agree that po is better for poland than pis and sld , and that 's the only alternative that 's realistic , so i will probably vote them in next elections . 
  but i ca n't agree that tusk is that great . 
  first of all compare buzek with tusk - buzek were n't great at internal politics , but he did what he should - instituted the reforms ( all except education reform were good and needed ) . 
  even at cost of losing power prematurely . 
  tusk on the other hand keep power but do nothing ( and when he do - like with ofe - he destroys the system for short term gain ) . 
  po have president and prime minister for a few years already - they could have changed whatever they liked . 
  they decided to do nothing * and wait . 
  that may be the right thing for their good , but it is n't the right thing for poland . 
  * by nothing i mean nothing important with very small exceptions . 
  poland needs huge reforms now - mainly to deal with ticking demography bomb . 
  polish bff for quite a few centuries . 
  we have this proverb : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be they are a little butthurt about triannon . 
  now they have orban , which seems to be a lot like kaczy\u0144ski . 
  paul erdo : s was hungarian . 
  total length of motorways in poland : * 2007 - 1083 km * 2008 - 1282 km * 2009 - 1454 km * 2010 - 1560 km * 2011 - 1865 km * 2012 - 2448 km * 2013 - 2885 km ( forecast ) * 2014 - 3196 km ( forecast ) [ 7 ] and that 's not counting the expressways , that are of very similar quality to motorways . 
  so yeah , there were some delays , but overall it 's success . 
  ha saved austria that later divided polish-lithuanian commonwealth together with prussia and russia . 
  good fighting by sobieski but he should do realpolitik instead and switch alliances before russia and austria regained strength . 
  besides at the time muslims were n't less civilized than christians . 
   russia was not a very advanced country at the beginning of the second world war due to their late democratization . 
  calling stalinism `` democratization '' of russia overloads my irony meter . 
  well , yes . 
  just like we grew up out of greek mythology . 
  it 's still important part of european culture . 
   komisje maj\u0105tkowe http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/komisja_maj%c4%85tkowa there were 3593 applications by catholic church to these , and 5504 applications by jewish religious organizations . 
  seriously , it has nothing to do with justice and everything to do with `` get rich fast '' . 
  well , the problem is - there 's only one building and 1000 people remotely related to the original owners . 
  some of them got compensated , some of them are n't really related , some of them sold their rights to someone else ( sometimes a few times  ) . 
  ownership of old buildings in poland is complicated that way , that is n't only related to jewish property . 
  it 's very hard to even repaint tenament houses in lublin old town , because there 's like 60 legal owners all over the world , many of them ca n't be reached to ask for permission or do n't care .
