  yes russia would win in the end if nato wo n't help , but it would take months . 
  btw last time russia ( ussr actually ) invaded poland without germany they lost ( 1920 ) . 
  then they won in 1939 after a month of fighting ( and at the time germany was to the west , north and south of poland , and ussr was to the east ) . 
  no chance to win in 2 days . 
  [ mury ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-zaewymn6k&amp;list=pl01c90ceb73d5a69b&amp;index=16 ) by jacek kaczmarski - song is misunderstood , it 's about revolution turning against the people that started them ( nonconformists ) , but people took it for face value and it was an anti-communist anthem of solidarity . 
  inspired heavily by luis llach `` l'estaca '' , but the words and the message is different . 
  title means `` nobody gets to choose my friends for me '' and it 's a protest against soviet propaganda , polish-eastern germany friendship , and an apology to czechoslovakia for polish army taking part in 1968 pacification . 
  [ rota ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lrlznsn_0g ) by maria konopnicka - it was a protest song against forced germanization of poles in prussian partition . 
  very anti-german and they do n't like it somehow  [ bo\u017ce co\u015b polsk\u0119 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoj_8fp1qa ) - religious/patriotic song asking god to help poland . 
  if poland is independent it 's sung `` god , bless free poland '' , if poland is under occupation `` god , return us free poland '' . 
  it was at first a song for russian tzar that was at the time also a king of occupied poland . 
  melody was taken from english anthem , then melody changed a little and the words were changed to be more patriotic/less pro-russian . 
  [ bogurodzica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgttapxgwxa ) - religious anthem to the saint mary . 
  it comes from xiii/xiv century and is oldest known polish song . 
  it was used as an anthem of poland and lithuanian duchy . 
  it was sung by polish forces during the battle of grunwald ( tannenberg ) in 1410 . 
  i do n't know , there were no conflict where tactical nukes were used , and imho you could just as well use conventional missiles and artillery , with less risk of starting a nuclear war . 
  i 've heard armored divisions are safe from radioactivity at least short-term , so as long as they are not very close to the explosion they can fight . 
  and russians would still need to clear the minefields before going to warsaw . 
  i 'm still thinking more than 2 days . 
  poland is more-or-less uniformly populated . 
  russia has 20\u00a0000\u00a0000 people just in moscow and 100\u00a0000\u00a0000 elsewhere . 
  that 's 1/6th of population that you can hit with one nuke ( or even just fuel-air bombs if you use enough of them - see what firebombing dresden did ) . 
  oh and btw poland is buying stealth missiles from usa - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-158_jassm there 's this saying about living in glass houses and throwing stones . 
  but yes , if russia really want to start nuclear war it can destroy poland in 2 days . 
  poland would n't go under in 2 days . 
  even for thrid reich + ussr it took a month , and then we had worse gear than enemies . 
  now we have same quality or better . 
  right . 
  maybe if you use nukes . 
  a lot of countries started their own currencies . 
  poland did it 4 times in xxth century alone . 
  it 's not hard , and if scotland plans to enter eu quickly they can just peg it to euro from the start . 
  i do n't care what f and c stands for , i just want the acronym to be fuck . 
  you got a in populism and crowd manipulation . 
  invasion of ukraine is done in bad faith too , but it 's not a concern of the contract between gazprom and pgnig . 
  just like the fact that poland sells its gas to ukraine . 
  btw - gas is a fungible good so the whole contract point was dumb , but that 's not our problem . 
  on the other hand the contract says that pgnig has the right to specify how much gas it would like to get each day ( within min and max values ) and gazprom has to send that amount of gas . 
  that point of the contract was clearly broken . 
  poland produces 30 % of our consumption . 
  we also buy some gas outside russia . 
  how do you know we reexport the same gas we buy from russia ? 
  gazprom is violating the contract in this way . 
  airports have limited capacity . 
  mos tourist got to crimea by train or car , so now they have to build bigger terminals , to allow as many people get there by plane . 
  till then there will be much less tourists in crimea than before . 
  this is called cognitive dissonance . 
  it happens when you think stereotypes are true , and compare them wth the real world . 
  your bully grew up . 
  it 's funny how in england these are called working class , while in poland everybody is working class , and such people are called bandits and losers ( and usually they do n't have a job ) . 
  fun fact - in poland ireland is quite popular song theme . 
  for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsroh2xp-0 ( i love you like i love ireland ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8zagmnmtri ( green ireland ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcqwrt62ydo ( irish ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dvqqqndyk ( when i 'll return to my ireland ), 
  i think it 's because most educated women migrate to western germany  http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/images/publications/mapsofthemonth/mom_february2013/semigra_high-quality.png, 
  you still have `` women at home , men at work '' ? 
  in poland few families would be able to live with just one parent working ( and many women would love to be able to stay at home ) . 
  2 headed eagle . 
  monster i mean . 
  i buy dacia if you buy solaris . 
  czechs went that route ( c with an arrow for cz ) . 
  somehow everybody still call them czech republic  there are advantages to both ( the less special letters the less need for transcription for example ) . 
  i disagree about the speed of reading , you do n't readsingle letters anyway - you read words and lines at once . 
  i would get rid of the ch , rz and \u00f3 before changing anything else in polish language . 
  btw polish adopted words en masse too - we just have grammar that almost force you to change the spelling eventually ( because you need to declinate and add pre and post fixes to words to use them ) . 
  so we have komputer and kolor and bateria and akumulator . 
  btw we stolen words for color from 3 languages : kolor is color , barwa ( czech color ) is sth like shade or hue buf not exactly , and farba ( german color ) is a paint . 
  english is very different when it comes to linguistics - for exampl it 's much less redundant . 
  in polish you encode gender and tense in each verb , so words are longer but sentences are shorter ( you can skip half the words ) . 
  it 's hard to compare such different languages . 
  no , but i choose polish before all other products . 
  yeah , because sh is so much better than sz . 
  or german sch for that matter . 
  it 's just a different convention . 
  btw our alphabet is at least consistent and mostly phonetic . 
  99 % percent of the time same letters = same sound . 
  we do n't have spelling bees contests . 
  i 'd argue most alphabets in the world including polish are better than english . 
  unlike english kids - polish do n't have to separately learn how to write and how to pronounce each word . 
  there are a few redundant letters ( h = ch for example ) , but there are rules as to when to use h and whsn to use ch . 
  compare to english ( which is actually 2 languages - 1 spoken and 1 written ) . 
  y is a vovel in polish . 
  cz is one sound - almost like english ch . 
  sz - english sh so it 's only 2 consecutive consonants : shch . 
  i doubt americans would be able to tell polish from russian . 
   keep in mind , a few years ago a polish aircraft carrying many important officials ( including the president ) crashed in russia due in part to heavy fog . 
  in general i agree with you , but that example is bad one - it crashed precisely because it attempted ** landing ** in a thick fog . 
  it 's still violation of the contract - gazprom has to provide as much gas as pgnig requests ( as long as it 's less than maximum daily limit written in contract , and it was ) . 
  it works this way - evefy day pgnig posts its request and gazprom sends the gas . 
  for the last few days pgnig posted more than usual and gazprom still sent the usual amount without explanation . 
  it 's violation of the contract , but technicaly both sides say the truth ( it 's 45 % less than it should be , yet it 's the same amount it was sent a few days before ) . 
  russia is angry that poland sends the gas to ukraine . 
  but poland produces 30 % of it 's consumption by itself , so if poland buy more gas in russia , and sends polish gas to ukraine it 's not against the contract ( even if the clause about not reselling russian gas to ukraine was binding - there are doubts about that ) . 
  so it wzs unilateral contract violation by russia . 
  not the first time , btw . 
  and the 45 % is because of buildup . 
  the first day it was around 20 % less than requested , so the next day they wanted to fill the missing gas for the last day , and to get new one , so it eventually became 45 % of daily import . 
  you ca n't even cut down a tree you planted on your damn backyard without permission from the state nowadays . . 
   with help from outside agents . 
  this is the point that i disagree about . 
  the only outside help was the trip by 3 foreign ministers to stop the violence after janukowycz ordered to shoot civilians .
