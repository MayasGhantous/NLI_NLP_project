  not many old teachers know english good enough to teach , that 's probably why there are n't more of such courses . 
  anyway , nobody have a problem with that . 
  people from abroad come and leave their money here , why should we complain ? 
  if you did n't invested more than that in power grid you now have to diseable most of the freshly build powerplants , because current powerlines wo n't be able to deal with varying output of these solar and wind powerplants . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-energy-expert-argues-against-subsidies-for-solar-power-a-866996.html  photovoltaic systems are distributed across hundreds of thousands of small power plants , which sounds nice . 
  but when the sky is blue over germany , these hundreds of thousands of decentralized plants act like a single , large power plant . 
  all of the sudden we have 30,000 megawatts coming into the grid , which , in many cases , we ca n't use . 
   i do n't want to bore you with the details , but a surplus and fluctuations lead to very unpleasant systemic effects . 
  we have voltage fluctuations within the grid that create problems for industry . 
  or we overload the grids in neighboring countries . 
  poland is in the process of installing technical equipment to protect its grids by keeping out surplus german electricity . 
  basically germany is using poland energy grid to dump occasional surpluses , and our grid ca n't deal with that without significant investment . 
  in a way we pay for their movement to green energy . 
  i want this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/launch_loop  lofstrom estimates that an initial loop costing roughly $ 10 billion with a one-year payback could launch 40,000 metric tons per year , and cut launch costs to $ 300/kg , or for $ 30 billion , with a larger power generation capacity , the loop would be capable of launching 6 million metric tons per year , and given a five-year payback period , the costs for accessing space with a launch loop could be as low as $ 3/kg . 
  [ 5 ] and no new materials need to be invented for this to work ( unlike with space elevator ) . 
  so that 's just 22\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 eur for construction of the initial loop , and then we could send stuff to space for $ 3 per kg . 
  the rest of the money goes into building a moon base , and extraction of he-3 ( for powerplants ) . 
  she should have won in 1994 https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ko9elaset3q#t=55s, 
  over 200\u00a0000\u00a0000 people in europe live outside eu , most of them wo n't enter eu any time soon ( european parts of russia ) . 
  maybe it 's simpler for you to ignore their existence , but that does n't make the simplification correct . 
  if he was nazi then yep , that 's exactly the good way to talk about him . 
  and that way is called `` incorrectly '' . 
  like english people towards welsh , i guess . 
  nobody see the difference when they do n't use their weird language , and the language is quite cute so what 's the problem - it 's not like they will demand autonomy or sth . 
  recently kaczy\u0144ski tried to target more autonomy-minded silesians as `` hidden german option in poland '' , and while kaczy\u0144ski has like 30 % support in most matters , that time everybody just laughed it off , it was so absurd . 
  the xenofoby that do exists in poland is mostly towards gypsies ( cause that 's the most problematic and most visible minority ) . 
  sorry , not in the ranking .

  so we differ in predictions . 
  time will tell . 
  i do think they eventually will come down . 
  i 'm quite interested in 3d printers and consider building some rep-rap model for myself , but i 'm an enthusiast , and i do n't think they will be ever as popular among `` regular people '' as paper printers . 
  for one thing i do n't see why regular person will need them more than once-twice a year ( to fix something , that can be easier and cheaper fixed by ride to nearest mall ) . 
  for rc-modeling hobbyist it may be good investment . 
  lastly i do n't think they are so game changing for guns . 
  we have had cnc machines for some time already , everybody can buy regular tools and do their own gun by hand , and including the time it takes to build 3d printer it is more convenient to only make the gun . 
  and it will be made of iron and not some cheap plastic . 
  i do n't think cheap 3d printers will be able to print hard metals any time soon . 
  and you still need to make the bullets and the cartridges . 
  not very complicated chemistry , but i do n't think you can print complete cartridge . 
  i 've heard there is benefit from state in nordics countries if you do n't work ? 
  in poland it 's not enough to live , and it 's over after 180 days , and in your countries it does n't end if you search for a job ? 
  but i got that from someone from norway or sweden writing on internet forum , and may remember sth wrong . 
  well , in poland renting a flat in big city costs around $ 300 , add bills and it 's 100 % of usual first salary for people just out of university ( which you graduate at 25 y.o. 
  btw ) . 
  buying a flat in big city requires credit for 20 years or more with 2 people working , and maybe you will have enough money left to go on a trip once a year , maybe not . 
  do n't even think about buying a new car . 
  and we do n't get money from state just for living , like you do in nordic countries . 
  all in all - it 's mostly economic problem here . 
  poland - you have to get licence from government and you have to register the weapon . 
  there are a few classes of weapons , with different requirements and licences ( hunting rifles have different requirements from self-defence weapons for example ) . 
  historical reconstructions using black powder are exempted from the rules , as are sport guns on pressurized air . 
  i 'm quite happy with that law , there 're almost no gun-related crimes in poland . 
  i do n't think 3d printable guns change anything regarding gun control in next 5-10 years . 
  for one thing access to good 3d printers is n't easy nor cheap . 
  for another - the quality of printed guns ( espeically using 3d printers that are cheap and accessible like rep-rap ) will probably be very bad . 
  you can already make a gun by hand using regular tools and iron , and if you are careful it will be much better than plastic 3d printed gun . 
  it 's called philipinian sickness in poland ( after our president aleksander kwa\u015bniewski visited philipiness ) . 
  he also tried to enter the limo using baggage doors , thus these are called `` presidential doors '' now . 
  nope if people from member countries can decide ( and they should ) . 
  to be fair russia has population density of 8 people per square kilometer , poland has 125 people per square km . 
  it 's much easier to deal with wild animals when there 's not too much terrain they can live on ( because most of the terrain is used for farming or cities ) . 
  these regions with a few dots in poland are also the wildest regions , with small population density and huge forests ( bieszczady mountains , bia\u0142owie\u017ca primordial forest , mazury lakeland ) . 
  polish is phonetic too , but we have a few characters for some sounds . 
  you say it like it 's sth bad . 
   `` esa continues to offer european states easy access to space . 
  last time , we had the first polish satellite launched into orbit , '' said antonio fabrizi , who is the director of launchers at the european space agency . 
  `` this time it will be the case for estonia to have a satellite in orbit . '', 
  take that r/polandball, 
  http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/72387093.jpg not my best photo , but shows a little commie architecture , placement on the hills , trees everywhere , and great old architecture - that 's lublin , poland for you . 
  at least you do n't revitalize your commie blocks that way : http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/66696138.jpg http://d.naszemiasto.pl/k/r/dc/cf/4ddca5b438ffe_g1.jpg http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bgwqui41day/tiwthps5lli/aaaaaaaaco4/a2ghw5anzqs/s640/dabrowska_bloki2.jpg i understand that 's overreaction to gray communism , but it 's even worse . 
  almost nobody believed in communism even before it started in ussr sphere of influence . 
  it was forced on these people because of jalta conference . 
  minority believed , most just pretended they believe when it was necessary . 
  how exactly values of these people were wrong ? 
  they lived their whole lives in regular countries , then war came , and then communists took the power . 
  were they culturally changed overnight ? 
  explain north/south korea or east/west germany differences that arose in 50 years . 
  people were the same initially , only the system changed . 
  the casuality is the other way around - poor countries suffer from brain drain , and the people that live there adapt to inefficient system . 
  but it can be changed completely in one generation . 
  i 've maybe heard kurwa 5 times in supermarket in poland . 
  and i live here for almost 30 years . 
  people ( usually young ) swear when nobody older is around , and even then not as much as poles abroad . 
  i think it 's because at first only young poles moved to uk , nobody understood them , so they sweared more and more . 
  then other people followed , and they wanted to fit in . 
  and now everybody got used to that . 
  kurwa is a convenient word , after all . 
  because people that go abroad think then can say anything , cause nobody knows them/their language . 
  same reason englishman coming to krak\u00f3w piss to the fountain on the central market . 
  to be fair - young poles do swear more , but not even close to the point that poles abroad do . 
  it 's not the standard , emulating that will make you seem uneducated in poland . 
  | we can assume that the trend will strengthen , although of course it does not compare in size to the outflow of poles . 
  so the net flow changed marginally if at all . 
  | the new workers are coming for polish pay , which for outsourcing workers varies from 6,000 zlotys ( $ 1,900 , $ 1,450 ) to 9,000 zlotys a month . 
  yeah right . 
  i use shitf + delete/insert to cut & paste , and ctrl + left/right to jump to previous/next word . 
  select next word is ctrl + shift + right .
