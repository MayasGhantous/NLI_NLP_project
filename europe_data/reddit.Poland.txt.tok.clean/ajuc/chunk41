  it 's very easy to switch the layout wihout noticing that way ( ctrl + shift ) . 
  i disable this function on all computers i use , but i often have to work on remote desktops , other people computers etc. 
  it has costed my more than a few days of wasted work in total to this day , i think . 
  and if you sum it up over the whole country it 's millions of $ of wasted time . 
  all because someone thought it 's good idea to enable that shortcut by default in poland ( where nobody has/use qwertz keyboard ) . 
  especially enfuriating when it happens before you enter the new password in change password dialog . 
  poland should n't be divided on that map , in reality everybody use qwerty . 
  ctrl+s hift switching layout to qwertz in windows with polish locale is the most common problem people have with that os here , and i do n't know anybody who use qwertz on purpose . 
  probably that latin is neutral , good for motto , and played important role in europe history . 
  english is important now , but is not neutral . 
  it would make people from non-english-speaking countries feel like a less important citizens of eu . 
  nation states do n't need to be based on ethnicity ( and many are n't / were n't ) . 
  it 's 7 books actually . 
  there were 2 books with short stories ( the last wish is translated to english , the sword of the destiny is n't ) , and 5-book-long saga . 
  first 2 books of the saga are translated to english iirc , and there are fan translation of the whole saga on the witcher game forum . 
  you should ideally read them in that order short stories - saga , but the english publisher decided to skip the sword of destiny somehow . 
  imho the short stories collections are excellent , one of the best fantasy books i 've read , saga is ok , but not as great . 
  hard to choose one , but i think `` ferdydurke '' by witold gombrowicz is the most universal . 
  yes i think that today citizen militias ca n't defend against regular army . 
  i mean army with hyper-sonic planes , bombs , artillery , drones , missiles etc. 
  in particular : - what would citizen army do against fuel-air bombs dropped from planes flying at over 10 km altitude ? 
  no portable aa missile system can hit targets so high , aa guns are also basically useless against such targets . 
  cities and infrastructure can be destroyed very easily and cost-effectively with such bombs . 
  how long would citizen milita fight without fuel , electricity , communication ( powerplants , supply chain and communication infrastructure were destroyed in the first attack ) . 
  when the whole country is ruined and every remaining road is full of people escaping burning cities ? 
  what would citizen militia do against long range artillery ? 
  cell phones wo n't work , enemy controls air and has many drones to give targets to the artillery . 
  all you see is every 5 seconds something explodes nearby . 
  enemy can be anywhere in 60 km radius . 
  what would citizen army do against that ? 
  notice , that usa were created when warfare was very different , and now usa have huge standing army . 
  switzerland is in mountains , in the middle of now-peaceful europe . 
  vietnam is in jungle and communists helped them . 
  afghanistan is desert + mountains , and it was conquered easily last time . 
  even if it 's costly to keep army there , by the time europe will be conquered we already lost . 
  the point is n't to make the invader eventually go away . 
  that 's easy - wait 200 years and almost every country will die by itself from one reason or another and then you are free and can start over again . 
  poles tried that many times and it works - you just need to keep your culture and be patient . 
  do you want eu to bet on that ? 
  the point of army is to keep others from destroying your country . 
  you do n't need to occupy country for long to destroy it . 
  europe is mostly nice flat hills or valleys , good roads , nowhere to hide . 
  blitzkrieg works great in europe . 
  nice idea , but it only works as a detterent , not as a real defense . 
  regular army will win the war easily , then do whatever it wants to the occupied country ( most probably kill or capture the leaders/scientists/etc , destroy the industry and infrastructure , steal everything that 's worth and easy to steal ) , then sign favourable peace treaty , that allows them to sell their now more competive products to the destroyed country . 
  if the country regains power repeat the procedure . 
  as long as you are quick you do n't lose too much to the resistance . 
  no need to occupy forever . 
  so you generalize about poles , that we generalize about others , 
  is n't it basically pointless exercise in torturing animals for pleasure ? 
  as bad as stealing in my book . 
  ah , that 's understandable . 
  that was solidarity times  it was more a matter of worse food than starving ( small amount of meat , no fruits or sweets , etc - for everything you had to go to the black market ) . 
  and then government tried to increase prices to reflect the real cost of stuff , and workers striked , and then strikes for smaller prices turned into strikes against communism . 
  government even said strikers were massing weapons to kill party members , and that was pretext to introduce the martial law . 
  hunger in poland ? 
  could you give some more details ? 
  cause i 've never heard about that , and i live in poland ( and remember things after 1989 quite well - it 's my childhood ) . 
  poland actually had private farmers all the time during communism ( unlike other communist countries ) , and hunger was one thing we avoided . 
  song about why it 's so much better than other cities  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhbiahiddj8 generally i would skip business centers and capital cities , and go for old and less wealthy cities . 
  life 's much more relaxed there . 
  for example in poland skip warsaw and krak\u00f3w ( this is subjective , and many poles will disagree  ) . 
  who paid you , 
  berlin is slavic name too . 
  most of that you learn by speaking . 
  only after you already know how to speak you learn in school what the rules are . 
  nouns also change with the numbers in a weird way : - 1 apple = 1 jab\u0142ko - 2-4 apples = 2-4 jab\u0142ka - 5-21 apples = 5-21 jab\u0142ek - 22-24 apples = 22-24 jab\u0142ka - 25-31 apples = 25-31 jab\u0142ek etc. 
  and it applies to every noun there is , but the endings may be different . 
  the correct noun ending depends on the last 2 digits of the quantity of the thing . 
  that 's why almost no software written outside poland deals correctly with showing messages like `` you got n new messages '' . 
  they always use wrong ending for some numbers  also old polish had 3 types of plurality : - singular ( 1 object ) - dual ( 2 objects ) - plural ( more than 2 objects ) most languages have only singular and plural . 
  in modern polish the dual kind disappeared , but not completely - in some proverbs and archaic words it still exist . 
  another thing - you use other version of noun to say you have object , and different to say you do n't have that object . 
  i have an apple = `` mam jab\u0142ko '' . 
  i do n't have an apple = `` nie mam jab\u0142ka '' . 
  of course the words depends on the number of things also . 
  so : i have 2 apples = `` mam dwa jab\u0142ka '' . 
  notice the different endings in both the number and the noun . 
  and so on , for every word you need to know all the versions to speak correctly ( you will be understood without knowing that , of course , most of the time at least ) . 
  also we have 7 grammatical cases ( german has 4 afair ) . 
  we have separate version of every noun for calling to get its attention , for example , also separate version for when we lack this particular thing . 
  example : it 's magdalena = `` to magdalena '' ( the basic case ) i lack magdalena = `` brakuje mi magdaleny '' ( lacking sth , missing sth , not having sth ) i like magdalena = `` lubi\u0119 magdalen\u0119 '' ( speaking about one-way relations , in which the other object/subject is inactive , hard to describe ) i give flowers to magdalena = `` daj\u0119 kwiaty magdalenie '' ( `` target case '' , for when the object/subject is target of some action ) i used magdalena = `` wykorzysta\u0142em magdalen\u0119 '' ( `` tool case '' - for using sth/sbd ) i stand near magdalena = `` stoj\u0119 przy magdalenie '' ( `` place case '' - for speaking about places and spatial relations ) magdalena , come here !, 
  ( calling to get sth/sbd attention ) every noun is changed in every phrase depending on the role it plays in it ( some words have a few cases that are the same , but for most words every case is different ) . 
  bonus point - nowhere in these phrases i used the word for `` i '' in polish ( `` ja '' ) . 
  it 's almost always omitted , because verbs conjugate depending on who performs the action . 
  also pkp wants to destroy half of the rails , cause it 's not profitable to serve the smaller cities/villages with train . 
  click the link , and you will be enlightened . 
  volume of rails per person , 
  should be sorted by length , or made as a regular bar graph . 
  this is hard to compare . 
  i would need to sign a 12-month long contract then , and the price 60 pln is only for the first 3 months , for the rest 9 months it 's 120 pln ( read the small print ) . 
  i do n't need more transfer , really . 
  i can download a movie in less than 5 minutes . 
  i can watch 2 videostreams with ok quality at once ( tested yesterday - polish representation match and sc2 toudnament ) . 
  what would i use more transfer for ? 
  i do n't really care for more transfer , and lag is ok ( i sometimes play sc2 ) , so i keep this . 
  http://www.speedtest.net/result/2593899403.png no limits obviously . 
  56 pln per month ( 14 euro per month ) . 
  but it depends on the city . 
  `` sz '' in polish = `` sh '' in english ( like in she ) `` cz '' in polish = `` ch '' in english ( like in catch ) `` ci '' = `` chee '' more or less ( ee like in teen ) szczecin = `` shchecheen '' slightly different sounds , but almost that .
