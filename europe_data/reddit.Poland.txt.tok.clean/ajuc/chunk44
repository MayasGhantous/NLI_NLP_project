  half of them are common for the whole central europe , i think . 
  certainly for the parts that have real winter . 
  [ spoiler ] fight club [ / spoiler ], 
  it 's 20 suicides per year per 100,000 people . 
  with such small probabilities the `` accessibility '' heuristic ( everything is as prevalent among population , as often i see it among my friends ) is very misleading . 
  btw that 's why small countries are often at the top and at the bottom of such lists - a few incidents can skew their average up or down depending on whether given year was good or bad . 
   also punctuation . 
  you should use verbs in sentences . 
  european organised crime has never been so competitive . 
  yes , i know , i just do n't understand why usa-eu trade war would impact china-usa trade . 
  are n't most modern arm cpus made in china ? 
  i thought about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_notation#e_notation . 
  and euro symbol looks similar to e. 
  should be 1 $ 9 , 
  or sue you . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'd write ( and pronounce ) it as `` b\u0119d\u0119 na skajpie '' . 
  but my english pronunciation is horrible , cause i 've learnt english from programming books and computer games  also i 've always thought cherry means wi\u015bnia ? 
  we borrowed many words/phrases from german , so it 's possible . 
  my favorite is `` wihajster '' from `` wie heist er '' - it can be anything , mostly it 's used when doing some technical work and you need someone to give you part with complicated name you do n't feel like pronouncing/remembering at the time . 
  example : `` janek , give me this wihajster ! '' . 
  janek should know from the context what wihajster means at the moment . 
  it 's common prank played on young workers to ask them to bring wihajster without context and act like they should know what that is , 
  do you mean `` spleen '' ? 
  i 've heard that the latest process to produce graphene is a little better than that ( http://phys.org/news/2011-04-team-material-graphene.html ) . 
   the new method is based on using the technique of epitaxy on silicon carbide in a gaseous , pressurised environment , whatever this means . 
  polish is like english here - names for new things are borrowed . 
  only a few words are translated . 
  weirdest translation i 've heard is `` ma\u0142pa '' ( monkey ) for the symbol '' @ '' ( cause it looks like monkey with long tail ) . 
  it 's funny that we sometimes borrow words with same meaning from 2 different lagnuages and they have 2 different meanings in polish . 
  example - `` bateria '' is borrowed from english battery , akumulator is from latin . 
  in polish bateria means non-rechaergeable battery and akumulator means reachargeable battery . 
  of course now that english is so common people mistranslate `` reachargeable battery '' to '' \u0142adowalna bateria '' , which is stupid , incorrect and too long , but what can you do . 
  another example - we use all of these for different kinds of schools : politechnika , uniwersytet , akademia , liceum , technikum and gimnazjum . 
  we steal words from everybody , from ancient greeks to anglophones  i like the fact that unlike english we adjust borrowed words to polish phonetics . 
  thanks to that 99 % of polish language is phonetic - you can read almost any new word in polish correctly only knowing a few rules . 
  again - recent popularity of english break this , cause some new words are borrowed `` as is '' . 
  i hope with time we will polonise these words too . 
  you do n't . 
  brand new server room and brand new air conditiner . 
  i started working there a few months after they finished it . 
  related ? 
  it 's `` przeci\u0105g '' in polish  and it 's almost as feared there . 
  including old people in public transport requesting you to close the windows , cause there 's cold draft , when it 's 20c outside and sunny . 
  it comes from the times before antibiotics and vaccines , when regular cold really could kill you . 
  old customs do n't die easily . 
  another one is `` to catch wolf '' which means to get unspecific infection because of sitting on something really cold without proper isolation ( cloths are n't considered enough ) . 
  mothers all over poland terrify their children with this , when kids sit on cold ground or stone , or even ( the horror ) on the snow . 
  i know it has some sense for women ( they can easily catch bladder infection because of cold ) , but mothers scare boys as well , without any sensible reason . 
  another thing is airconditioning - when i was working in place with air conditioning ( in a server room ) i was sick constantly ( it was very hot summer , 30c outside all the time , 18c in the server room ) . 
  most of my friends working there were also sick that summer . 
  so , basing on anegdotal evidence - it is n't healthy to have really big differences in air temperature . 
  on the other hand i like to shower with hot and cold water alternately , and it does n't give me any problems . 
  polish public debt to gdp ratio ( counted the eurostat way ) in 2007 was 47.7 % , in 2012 it was 56.5 % . 
  no way it 's 50 % increase . 
  source : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/poland/government-debt-to-gdp, 
  you just ca n't criticize israel without being antisemite . 
  no matter where are you from . 
  it 's just too easy argument to use , so people use it . 
  accept that , and frustration goes away . 
  right decision . 
  there are already game companies publishing without drm and they do well ( cd projekt red for example , or the whole gog site ) . 
  why books should be different ? 
  and every pole would be wrong . 
  in poland after half a year of unemployement you stop getting help from the state ( and the help was a joke anyway - less than 200 euro per month ) . 
  in usa they have food stamps ( free food basically ) . 
  that 's why you study in another city , preferably one that is far away from your home  . 
  this still counts as living with parents , i think , cause you are just temporarily renting a flat/living in a dorm . 
  it 's very popular in poland . 
  no wonder poland is in the top 5 . 
  average 55m2 flat price in one of the top 10 biggest cities ( where you can find a job ) - 300 000 pln ( 75 000 euro ) . 
  average salary - 2 620 pln ( 650 euro ) after tax ( most people , especially most young people earn sth around 1800 pln = 450 euro ) . 
  whole salary of young couple ( both working ) for 7 years will buy them a 55m2 flat , and they need to eat and pay bills somehow , so its more like 20-30 years ... and people wonder why poles do n't have kids . 
  yes , yalta conference . 
  but i think more common association would be gentelman drinking tee at five'o clock , or the place you go to work during holidays . 
  wow , 3 years it apprenticeship ? 
  i had around a month it apprenticeship in poland ( unpaid , wasted time in public institution , but at least it was n't 3 years ) . 
  if you visit lublin next time , i can show you around  it 's still cheap , and we have [ airport ] ( http://www.airport.lublin.pl/en/ ) now . 
  yeah , i imagine moria during its golden age looked like wieliczka , 
  i am biased ( lublin citizen ) . 
  but i really think lublin is underestimated . 
  for many years it was hard to get there ( no airport , bad roads ) . 
  even most people in poland never been to lublin ( and everybody have been in cracow ) . 
  last year we 've finally built airport , so it 's not a problem any longer . 
  lublin has pretty and unique old town ( original buildings , not rebuilt decorations like warsaw ) , and people actually live in its old town ( unlike cracow , where every tenament house in centrum was turned into tourist attraction ) . 
  it has unique architecture style ( called lublin renneisance ) very different from western poland . 
  i think only cracow and toru\u0144 in poland have better old towns ( toru\u0144 is another underestimated city in poland when it comes to architecture - its medieval old town is stunning ) . 
  cracow is great , but very crowded , and twice as expansive as lublin or toru\u0144 ( cause prices are adjusted for foreigners ) . 
  some pics of lublin : - http://static.panoramio.com/photos/1920x1280/78731887.jpg - http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/77324447.jpg - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajuc00/5918934903/ - http://www.magiczny-lublin.pl/fotografie/albums/userpics/10002/normal_sklepienie2.jpg few pics of toru\u0144 : - http://utw.webd.pl/userfiles/file/rozne/torun_panorama.jpg - http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/81445890.jpg - http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/81445816.jpg, 
  i agree poland is worth it , but warsaw is n't that great touristically . 
  if you like ww2 history it 's worth seeing ( great interactive museum of 1944 uprising , restaured old city that was 90 % flat after war , remains of warsaw ghetto and 1943 uprising , etc ) . 
  but if you do n't particulary like ww2 tourism there are hundreds better places to see than warsaw in poland . 
  if you like old architecture better to go to cracow , toru\u0144 , malbork , lublin , gda\u0144sk , zamo\u015b\u0107 , maybe wroc\u0142aw . 
  polesie is also great . 
  warsaw is business city , not touristic city . 
  also warsaw will be the most expansive in poland , followed by seaside , tatry mountains and cracow . 
  it will be still much cheaper than western europe ( or even prague , for that matter ) , but in these less known cities prices are adjusted for poles , so everything is 1.5 - 3 times less expansive . 
  i mean 44 cm pizza in restaurant is 4-8 euro , and beer in pub is 1-1 .5 euro in places outside the most famous . 
  and if you can travel outside eu go to ukraine to see l'viv city . 
  it 's magical .
