  also worth seeing - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolf%27s_lair - it 's big complex of bunkers and underground installations made by germans during ww2 to coordinate eastern front fightings . 
  it 's in mazuria region of poland , also worth seeing because of tousands of lakes there . 
  the plot to kill hitler happened in the wolf 's lair , too . 
  other than that in poland i recommend gda\u0144sk ( also known as danzig of ww2 and solidarity fame ) , malbork ( kick ass teutonic order castle here - one of the biggest in europe ) , toru\u0144 ( great medieval city , planetarium there is nice , copernicus was born there ) , lublin ( the best preserved death and concentration camp - majdanek is nearby , there are still the original barracks there ) , also old town in lublin is pretty ( great renneisance and baroque sights , very different from germanic architecture in western poland , polish-lithuanian union was signed there , in lublin castle there is painting by famous matejko of that event ) . 
  it all depends on how much time you can spend in poland alone . 
  if we redraw borders to the traditional ones , poles in the western poland should start packing . 
  with czechs we would n't ever get anything done . 
  we would just be laughing ours asses off at each other language . 
  yes , ukraine 's much better choice . 
  if they want us , that is . 
  they have great beaches in crimea , their part of bieszczady mountains is even wilder than ours , and they have l'viv . 
  vilnius has nothing on l'viv . 
  hell , even krak\u00f3w is less pretty than l'viv . 
  also we can understand each other without translation , and we would be the largest eu country together , connecting baltic and black seas . 
  and ukrainians have nice aerospace and military industry . 
  multiply the numbers by the percentage at the bottom , then , to get cited papers number . 
  nobody cite useless papers . 
  sklep is `` shop '', 
  wales = dragon fuckers ? 
  which one ? 
  russia is a petrol state with nationalism instead of islam as governing ideology . 
  people do n't emigrate from uae . 
  lithuania is more or less as wealthy as poland , and they have very different language . 
  belarus is country-wide ussr themed amusement park sponsored by putin . 
  they earn less , but many things are still state-sponsored . 
  ukraine is just like poland in early nineties - complete chaos , big unemployement , wild capitalism , but with good perspectives . 
  i think most immigrants will come from ukraine , but nothing on the scale of polish immigration to uk . 
  germans - official : niemcy , nicknames : szwaby , szkopy italians - official : w\u0142osi , nicknames : makaroniarze ( from macaroni ) russians - official : rosjanie , nicknames : ruski , ruscy , kacapy english - official : anglicy , nicknames : angole , fajfokloki ( from five o'clock tea  ) french - official : francuzi , nicknames : \u017babojady ( frogeaters ) hungarians - official : w\u0119grzy , nicknames : madziary there 's also general rule for long country names , when you make shortcuts it becomes derogatory . 
  in polish `` s\u0142awa '' is `` praise '' / `` fame '' . 
  slav is `` s\u0142owianin '' and `` s\u0142owo '' means `` word '' . 
  basically s\u0142owianie called themselves `` people that can speak '' . 
  and others were `` niemcy '' = `` mute '' . 
  to this day germany in polish is `` niemcy '' , 
  yeah , i know . 
  i just do n't like that association . 
  yeah , stupid english makes this mistake too easy . 
  the problem is n't muslims or africans . 
  people that does n't work are the problem . 
  and we practically do n't have social , so the problematic people wo n't come here in the first place . 
  they can do nothing and live ok in uk , after all  also i do n't think poland will become net immigrant destination any time quick . 
  if you can enter eu , you have much better options than poland . 
  maybe for ~ ~ slaves ~ ~ slavs poland is an option , because of language . 
  other than that - i doubt it will be anything on big scale . 
  best things : people are honest , mostly . 
  shop clerk does n't smile at you if he does n't feel like it , and you do n't have to , too . 
  when somebody asks `` how do you do '' he expects real answer , not `` i 'm fine '' . 
  nobody cares about political correctness . 
  math and hard sciences are respected . 
  worst things : 3rd world salary , 1st world prices . 
  nobody cares about political correctness . 
  everybody complain all the time . 
  everybody are experts in everything . 
  in poland we celebrate st. nicholas ( 6th december kids find presents at morning under they pillows , sometimes \u015awi\u0119ty miko\u0142aj comes with presents ) , and 24th december ( yes , the day before christmass , there 's huge feast with whole family , it starts at evening , and lasts untill 24:00 , when everybody go to church ) . 
  the feast is without meat , only fishes , soups , mushrooms , such things ( cause it 's fast until midnight ) , only after the mass you can eat meat and such . 
  the most important food is usually carp ( people buy a live carp and bring it home three or two days before christmas eve . 
  it is kept one or two days in a bathtub , and then killed and prepared ) . 
  other traditional food is barszcz with mushroom filled `` uszka '' ( sth like dumplings ) . 
  there is custom to have in total 12 diffeent dishes , and to leave one empty place at the table for surprise guest . 
  another custom is to have a little hay under the tablecloth for luck , and to see family pets and household animals at midnight , they are supposed to speak to people if they are n't comfortable . 
  the feast starts with everybody taking blessed in church `` op\u0142atek '' [ christmas wafer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_wafer ) , breaking it and dividing with each other kissing and wishing each other something nice ( it 's the customary time in the year to forgive someone , too ) . 
  animals get different colored waffer in some regions ( but you do n't have to kiss them  ) . 
  everybody gets presents at christmass eve , too , in my region it works such - kids are told to look out for the first star , in the meantime presents `` appear '' under the christmass tree , when somebody see the first star everybody can unpack their presents . 
  who gives presents depends on region of poland . 
  in my region it 's santa claus ( \u015awi\u0119ty miko\u0142aj ) , in other it can be `` gwiazdor '' ( starman ) , or christ child . 
  alcohol is only alowed after the midnight , too , as is singing the carol songs ( but it depends on the family ) . 
  now you used this phrase , too . 
  member of the european commission wants more power for european institutions . 
  surprising . 
  in fact i had ( very small , but still ) influence on how my country does . 
  everybody does . 
  i voted . 
  in regional elections `` my '' candidate even won recently , and i think he does great so far . 
  i protested when government wanted to pass law that i did n't liked ( acta ) . 
  i emailed politicians when i did n't liked what they do . 
  i work here , even thought i could move to usa and easily earn 8 times as much , and i pay taxes . 
  yeah , my contribution is very small . 
  but it 's non-zero . 
  yes , i am proud of what people from poland achieved and i had my small share in it . 
  is it established in english that `` pride = = looking down on others '' ? 
  maybe we just have problem with translation ? 
  in polish we have 2 words for pride : `` pycha '' is the bad kind of pride , with looking down on others , `` duma '' is the kind where you know your value , but do n't boast . 
  it 's actually seen as something desirable to have . 
  when i play basketball i 'm proud when my team win . 
  i do n't think people from other teams are worth less because of that . 
  they 're my friends , and they can win next time . 
  that 's how competition work . 
   you are not were you come from . 
  of course not . 
  but where i came from is part of me . 
   that is the point where hate and conflict come into the world . 
  and here i thought the reason for conflict is money ( or power , which is basically the same ) . 
  you can have huge states united by peaceful ideology invading others , killing millions of people , etc. 
  ideology and emotions are just tools . 
  some states use pride , some use dialectic , others do n't bother with excuses at all . 
  the common factor is - rulers want power . 
  i believe you should n't judge art by how ethic author were  and he raised a few good points in that song . 
  also , can you point me to some evidences he was nationalistic ? 
  from what i 've read and heard he seemed rather liberal and was always for personal freedom . 
  this song you will probably like ( `` warcho\u0142 '' ) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7ludzktda4, 
  to be fair , they have some support on regional level .
