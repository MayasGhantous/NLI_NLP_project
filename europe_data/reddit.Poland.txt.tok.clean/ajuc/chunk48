  ups . 
   silesia has always been german http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesia#history tl ; dr - for huge part of its history , but not always . 
   if anything , the status of the german minority in poland should be equal to the status the sorb minority in germany well , it is . 
  they have bilingual street signs , schools , etc. 
  they also have guaranteed parliament representation even if their party do n't cross 5 % support level ( all regular parties have to cross that level to be in parliament ) . 
  how is it embarassement ? 
  i changed title from one that states opinion , to one that only says what is happening . 
  i also happen not to agree with kaczy\u0144ski on that matter , and i 've never voted him . 
  but i do n't agree with the way opposition is portraited in polish media ( you could see the hypocrisy best after smole\u0144sk crash - for one week lech kaczynski went from stupid loser dwarf that every word was reported as hateful to a great pole , famous for his great sense of humour , patriotism , etc ) . 
  i think media should stick to reporting news , instead of force-feeding opinions . 
  the district court in hamburg has dismissed a discrimination case against the german youth affairs office after it refused to allow a polish father to speak to his children in polish . 
  thirty nine year-old wojciech pomorski , a polish teacher who has been living in germany since the 1980s , demanded a written apology and 15,000 euro compensation from the youth affairs office ( jugendamt ) in hamburg because it did not allow him to speak polish with his two daughters when visiting them .

  do n't forget franek dolas . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  that way poles have bragging rights , and we do n't lose anything . 
  i agreed already that there 's difference in wealth and infrastructure . 
  i just oppose saying that there 's poland a-poland b divide in categories , in which there is none . 
  i agree regarding infrastructure and wealth , but i think you 're wrong regarding alcohol abuse , social degenration , etc. 
  more info ( with maps  ) here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14llnx/european_countries_and_their_model_regions/c7e8z7s unfortunately people in poland often repeat stereotypes regardin this east-west divide , even when it does n't really exist . 
  maybe that will work ( links to pdf files generated by that site ) , if not , i 'll do the screenshots when i got to home .

  yeah , reddit messed up the links cause of special characters , this is the site : http://www.mojapolis.pl/web/guest/factmine , you can click `` wybierz wska\u017anik '' ( choose indicator ) , and add the indicators i 've listed above , or other . 
  later i 'll make nice images and add them instead of hotlinking . 
  i think you mixed up a few more-or-less independent things together . 
  yes , infrastructure in the eastern poland is worse , both because of partitions , and because of modern focus on western regions ( for example - no motorways were built in lubelskie voivodship , ever ) . 
  yes , people earn less in eastern poland . 
  but i highly doubt we have more alcoholics in eastern poland , and i refuse to take such things on faith ( because it 's obvious , right ... ) . 
  all data is from http://www.mojapolis.pl/web/guest/factmine , i had to do screenshots to give linsk to the maps , because permalink functionality of that site is n't working well with reddit link formatting . 
  average number of people caught drunk per 1000 citizens : http://www.panoramio.com/photo_explorer#user=6259722&amp;with_photo_id=83241965&amp;order=date_desc percentage of people on social help : http://static.panoramio.com/photos/medium/83241968.jpg percentage of people with higher education : http://static.panoramio.com/photos/medium/83241964.jpg people registered in local libraries per 1000 citizens : http://static.panoramio.com/photos/medium/83241958.jpg unemployement % in productive age : http://www.panoramio.com/photo_explorer#user=6259722&amp;with_photo_id=83241971&amp;order=date_desc more data and info below . 
  you wo n't see this east-west line you 've described in these maps , and in many others on that site . 
  yet people still say things like `` eastern poland is the worst , drunk , uneducated , etc '' . 
  well , no . 
  we 're only the poorest part of poland . 
  the rest is uncalled for . 
  i understand where stereotypes come from , but i really think we should strive to fight stereotypes , at least when they are false . 
  yeah , basically . 
  i 've found data from polish statistic office for gdp per capita per region in 2000-2010 years . 
  http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/rn_notatka_pkb_2000-2010.xls mazowieckie voivodship ( with warsaw ) have + -150 % of gdp per capita , most regions have around 80-100 % , the most rural regions ( lubelskie , podkarpackie , \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie ) have 60-70 % of gdp per capita . 
  but i think it mostly depends on how big percentage of people lives from agriculture in each region . 
  the divide in poland is more about villages versus big cities , than one region vs another . 
  for example podkarpackie is poor as a region , but rzesz\u00f3w ( the capital of the region ) is quickly growing city , especially in it sector ( biggest polish and central & eastern european it group - asseco is from rzesz\u00f3w for example ) . 
  similiary in lubelskie voivodship - region as a whole is poor , but lublin as a city is quickly growing ( especially in it and education sectors ) . 
  but yeah , the salaries are smaller in smaller cities ( even 100 % difference between lublin and warsaw in it sector , for example ) . 
  i think the main problem of polish slower-developing regions is infrastructure . 
  for example - rzesz\u00f3w got airport a few years earlier than lublin , and during these years it developed much faster . 
  now lublin built airport too ( opens this month ) , and you can already see the effects in more foreign investment . 
  edit : maps of gdp per capita per region : http://static.panoramio.com/photos/1920x1280/83242045.jpg same , but per subregion ( you can see it 's not region vs region , but city vs countryside ) : http://static.panoramio.com/photos/1920x1280/83241973.jpg unfortunately i do n't have more detailed maps . 
  we do n't have euro , and in z\u0142otys we do have faces http://flagpedia.net/data/currency/pln/pln.png but we will probably switch to euro in next 10 years or so , and i 'd like to use that occasion to put scientists on the money instead of kings . 
  it 's funny , because the original book was made during pi\u0142sudski authoritarian government before ww2 , than there was movie during communism in 1956 , tv series in 1980 , and this remake in 2002 . 
  technicaly governments in poland in 1932 , 1956 and 2002 could n't be more different . 
  practically this is universal story about people going to power thanks to who they know and how they lie . 
  the `` szukam '' problem i 've encountered personally , when i was looking for the post office  for me the most funny czech/slovakian phrase is `` n\u00e1rodn\u00ed divadlo '' = = national theather . 
  dziwad\u0142o means `` freak '' in polish , 
  like , you know , the fall of the rome , 
  i 've read sth about `` white croats '' being name for the predecessors of poles . 
  here it 's sth about that : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_croatia white ( bia\u0142y ) meant `` western '' in old slavic languages , and it 's said western croatia was somewhere between modern germany , poland , slovakia , czech republic and ukraine . 
  balkans is europe . 
  but yeah , i 'll drink to 1000 years of peace , no problem . 
  except for falklands , balkan wars , iraq , afghanistan , and probably many other i forgot about . 
  probably in this case it 's import from hungarian to polish . 
  orszak does n't seem to come from any polish root , and sounds foreign when you think about it . 
  and it 's easy to imagine how it was imported - hungarian guardians of some vip came to poland , v ` oila . 
  [ blind guardian ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1afnokqdy-u ) from germany . 
  sorry about that . 
  i 've honestly tried to understand russian , ukrainian , czech and slovakian ( never learnt any of these languages ) . 
  it 's the hardest with russian ( even thought i know a few words from movies ) . 
  yeah , and our languages are so funny to each other ( at least czech/slovakian to poles ) . 
  many polish jokes are just polish word and its czech translation  ( half of them fake of course ) . 
  i was joking  nobody here is angry about such things . 
  most people treat it like a wild adventure from their youth . 
  hiding `` hot '' items , escaping militia , such things . 
  we were fighting communism that way , you should thank us  regardin bad pr - i do hope it will change , current situation is stupid . 
  regarding romanian-polish friendship from our side it 's sad - during the partitions of poland , 2nd polish republic and till the end of ww2 it was alive - for example many poles migrated to romania , romanians helped tousands of poles ( especially soldiers ) to escape poland after 1939 , and to go to france and then uk to keep fighting germans . 
  but now romania has bad pr in poland , mainly because it 's stereotypically where cyganie ( roma ) comes from . 
  and most poles do n't even remember that poland was allied with romania . 
  it 's sad how many stereotypes can form in such short time ( since 1989 ) . 
  poles , in turn , have soft spot for ireland , even if we never really interact with each other ( at least before 2004  , and this soft spot is much earlier , at least since early xx century ) . 
  i think it comes from both countries being traditionally catholic , occupied by non-catholic neighbors for huge part of their history , and fighting for freedom often . 
  also irish like to drink and sing , what 's not to like . 
  we even have a few popular songs about ireland , for example : - `` i love you like ireland '' by kobranocka http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsroh2xp-0 - `` ajrisz '' by t.love http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vpefc_6kig - `` green ireland '' by kowalski http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8zagmnmtri, 
  wow , and for me their word for police was example of how different they language is from every other  . 
  but that makes sense `` government '' in polish is `` rz\u0105d '' , 
  funny that they use slavic name for germans ( nemeth comes from niemiec/nemec / ... = mute in slavic languages , right ? 
  poles and hungarians have this `` brotherhood '' thing going on . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be we even have proverbs about each other : translation of polish version : `` pole and hungarian cousins be , good for fight and good for party . 
  both are valiant , both are lively , upon them may god 's blessings be . '', 
  translation of hungarian version : `` pole and hungarian -- two good friends , joint fight and drinking are their ends . '', 
  it dates back to common kings ( polish w\u0142adys\u0142aw warne\u0144ski , hungarian stefan batory ) , common heroes ( polish general - j\u00f3zef bem was fighting in hungarian uprising ) , and hungarians were helping poles in early xx century ( they were allied with germany , but they were n't fighting poles , even thought germans were very upset about that ) . 
  there 's many more examples of this . 
  some historicians says poles are also genetically close to hungarians ( but that 's strange , our languages could n't be more different ) . 
  is n't it stupid to give you benefit based on which branch of industry you worked in ? 
  it should either depend only on how much you earned ( cause it 's financed from that ) , or should be same for everybody . 
  according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties greece lost 4.5 % of 1939 population during ww2 . 
  ussr lost 13 % , poland lost 16 % . 
  stop complaining already . 
  somehow the countries that went throught the shock reforms ( that n. klein so despised ) are better now , than the countries that sticked to the state monopoly longer , and refromed slower . 
  ojczyzna , or ojcowizna is the world in polish ( depending if you mean whole country , or only your closest neighbors , family , and place ) . 
  and on the trees instead of leaves there will be hangin ' communists . 
  but in the end we have n't done this , and i think it 's for the better .
