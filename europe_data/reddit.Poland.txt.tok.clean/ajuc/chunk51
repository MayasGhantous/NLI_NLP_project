  now it 's more detailed , some things require 60 % of support thanks to proportional system it 's close to 60 % at least ) . 
  or , you know , they do n't actually think things are so bad that it justifies 15 minutes lost time during a weekend . 
  which is one way to answer the `` antisystem '' politicians that cry how poland is ruined and everything 's lost . 
  if that was the case we would have another solidarity . 
  instead nobody cares because for majority of people things are going ok , or at least better than if the antisystem politicians got power . 
  po would have 60 % -80 % in parliament for the last 8 years if we had fptp elections for sejm . 
  and now pis would have 60-80 % . 
  i do n't like that . 
  most poles that would vote no if they had to vote one way or the other - stayed at homes instead because there was bigger chance to stop this by lowering turnout than by going and voting against it . 
  that 's because the turnout even for important referendums is usually smaller than 50 % , and 50 % is required for it to be binding . 
  so basicaly 92 % people that did n't show up were split between people that did n't care and people that were against . 
  the exact proportions are unknown , i would say it was 30 % people against and 70 % people that had not cared . 
  questions were stupid , and the referendum was made as a political statement by a losing president . 
  example of stupid question : - do you want to change x to be sth else or no ? 
  it does n't say to what the change will be , 
  and that 's why you do n't want to base international trade on currency that collapses ever 10 years . 
  ruble collapsed at least 4 times in the meantime . 
  if it does n't really have value you can give all your money to me , right ? 
  if you like dumber animals , obviously . 
  poland : - probably german shephard , also there 's a lot of spaniels and setters - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_tatra_sheepdog to both questions - irish setter , but generaly i prefer mutts to pure breeds, 
  400 vs 40 000 , loses 100 vs 2000 : that 's what happens when you forget to increase land maintenance before starting a war . 
  would have been welcomed with flowers . 
  taken . 
  no `` re '' there . 
  it was never polish before . 
  it 's minority . 
  it was part of lithuania and not crown during commonwealth . 
  admitedly , it was n't called `` republic of lithuania '' then , but why does it matter ? 
  it was also lithuanian between 12 july 1920 ( when soviets ceded the control to lithuanians ) and 12 october 1920 ( when \u017beligowski conquered the city for poland using the same approach that putin did in crimea ) . 
  then it was formaly part of polish-puppet `` republic of central lithuania '' until 2 years later , which i guess counts as a republic of lithuania if you care about the `` republic '' part of name so much . 
  i do n't understand why you feel the need to enrage lithuanians and argue in favour of obvious errors of past polish politics . 
   soviet lithuania stole many lands from poland after ww2 . 
  it 's `` a little '' more complicated than that . 
  and you should really learn polish history before speaking about it . 
  that 's the theory , but look at usa , it 's like you took people from eu , put them in big cities ( suburbs of the cities i mean ) , and the rest of the country is empty . 
  if such thing happened in europe cultures and languages would die , and whole countries would be deserted . 
  land has very small inherent value if nobody wants to live there . 
  monarchist as in `` i want king to have real power '' ? 
  in poland if you 're not right-wing you are outcast . 
  what works . 
  i 'm ok with it as long as it allows individual basic liberties , good economic growth , and does n't have catastrophic error conditions ( small group of people deciding abhorent policy and nobody can do anything about it , or majority deciding we strip minority of basic rights and minority ca n't do anything , or it 's so inefficient somebody take over ) . 
  at the time i 'd call myself center-right politicaly and economicaly ( more center than right ) , with libertarian social views , but i change my mind often . 
  extremists are often made when people are exposed to viral ideology ( most sucessful ideologies are viral , obviously ) without the usual immunities developed around it by the culture surrounding the ideology to make it reasonable . 
  like viruses - ideologies are usually agressive at first , then societies believing in them develop immunities and safeguards around them to blunt them off and make them liveable . 
  in case of religions with holy script - the precautions are the interpretations that say `` this part is just a metaphore , do n't do that literally '' . 
  usually it 's not even conscious , it 's just what society expects of you . 
  that 's why christians do n't cut off their limbs when they have naughty thoughts . 
  and do n't kill their kids after the first communion ( the only 100 % way to grant them the heaven ticket ) . 
  and now most christians believe in evolution and that world is n't 6000 years old . 
  but people coming from different background when they become infected with a new ideology do n't have these safeguards , and that can make the ideology very silly and/or very harmful . 
  especially if these people were exposed to rationality , and are used to taking conclusions and trying to make their beliefs consistent . 
  trying ot make self-contradictory beliefs consistent is hard work , and can lead to people doing outrageus things with good intentions . 
  most terrorists are neophites . 
  for example according to http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/opinion/the-madrassa-myth.html from 75 terrorists studied - 53 % attended western college , and only 9 attended religious school instead . 
  and these 9 were all part of 1 plot , and were managed by people that did attended western university . 
  it may be that we should be preemtively teaching the precautions to the world most viral ideologies to people that do n't believe them yet . 
   `` inequalities '' is quite a loaded term . 
  kind of implies that one side deserves something from the other . 
  depends on the initial contract . 
  if eu was to become unitarian state - a ot of areas would lose control over politics , and lose economicaly . 
  they would become backward shitholes forever basicaly . 
  there would be huge population redistribution . 
  if people agreed to prevent this when starting the state by reddistribution of resources - it 's not only ok to do that later - it 's the only honest way . 
  btw this is the reason i do n't want eu to become more closely bound . 
  not the right triangles . 
  should be equilateral and they are right . 
  i mean not right . 
  i mean - right angles should n't be there . 
  damn english . 
  slightly higher , yes . 
  but leszek miler is working hard to extinguish these chances . 
  and right-wing nutters are on the rise recently , unfortunately . 
  i would n't be surprised if total votes for sld and palikot was the same as total for rn and korwin in next elections . 
  leszek miler is interesting case , btw : putting og\u00f3rek for president , and speaking for russia regarding ukraine , it seemd so unreal , the only explanation i could find for that move was that putin has sth on miler . 
  or he is so detached from the society . . 
  regular right is anti-putin , like almost everybody in poland . 
  extreme right ( ruch narodowy for example , but also korwin to some degree ) is pro-putin . 
  see http://www.fronda.pl/a/polacy-zawsze-wierni-moskwie,35226.html http://niezalezna.pl/52583-kandydat-ruchu-narodowego-do-europarlamentu-popiera-rosyjska-okupacje-ukrainy of course left ( sld and palikot ) are pro-putin as well , but they are irrelevant in modern polish politics . 
  putin seems to be creating an international union of extreme right and extreme left anti-eu movements and parties . 
  2011 is ok on the other hand  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_england_riots, 
  should be sth like this : `` we 're happy that you grew up enough to start talks on ww2 reparations . 
  attached are our estimates of polish loses caused by ussr invasion of poland , mass murder of polish civilians and prisoners of war in katy\u0144 and other sites , mass rapes during so called `` liberation '' , theft of art from our museums and machines from our factories , illegitimate use of our uran mines for your nuclear industry , etc. 
  we are also attaching invoices for all the exenses for 50 years of usage of our military bases by your army . 
  when we settle on these problems i 'm sure we can work out the details on the nazi gold train . '', 
  you 'll still win with baltic states airforces taken together , 
  soviet aeropspace industry was based in big part in modern ukraine . 
  saying old migs are russian is like saying f-16 is washingtonian plane after usa divided into separate states . 
  for example : https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/37ht8e/the_real_winner_of_sundays_election_in_poland_no/crnghmz https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cxo7h/polish_president_has_drawn_criticism_after_he/cszy8v5 https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36qjpt/polish_senate_agreed_for_referendum_on/crg6nx9 komorowski was really hard to defend as a president , he did almost nothing and still made tons of mistakes . 
  mostly small mistakes fortunately . 
  duda is already looking to be worse . 
  what 's the word that works for both toes and fingers ? 
  in polish we have `` palce '' for that , but apparently in english hand fingers and foot fingers are inherently different body parts . 
  putin was choosen in fair elections the first time . 
  \u0141ukaszenko too most probably . 
  and you completely ignored bush and janukowycz . 
  americans do n't seem to have problem with calling their presidents dumb ( bush seriously deserved it ) , and in usa president has real power unlike in poland . 
  it 's not like it 's automaticaly the better way because it 's american , but if it 's ok for them , why is n't it ok for us ? 
  treating people differently because of their titles or roles , especially politicians , is a relict of times when democrations had to compete with real monarchies all around , and people needed that ceremony for the government to feel `` proper '' . 
  it 's like roman empire making ever more rituals around each new law introduced , while nobody really bothered to adhere to that law . 
  if the law worked well - the rituals would n't be needed , and no amount of rituals can help if the law is n't working .
