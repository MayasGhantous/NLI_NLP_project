  russia wants the war to last . 
  ukraine knows it ca n't win that war , and even if - russia will do sth else to prevent eu integration and economic success . 
  if ukraine becomes a success story - russians wo n't need putin and `` independent democracy '' . 
  putin wo n't allow that . 
  prices source : http://www.pintprice.com is this supposed to be beer in pub or beer in shop ? 
  because the price for poland ( $ 1.46 eur ) is highish even for pub beers outside of warsaw/wroc \u0142aw / krak\u00f3w . 
  and for buying beer in shops i 'd say 0.5-0 .75 eur is more probable average price . 
  you can buy cheap beer in malls for 0.3 eur . 
  young people will think it was black or blue , 
  never realized baltic languages are so similar to slavic . 
  polish : fog = mg\u0142a , snow = \u015bnieg . 
  from big cities i only lived in krak\u00f3w , warszawa , and lublin . 
  from these lublin wins easily . 
  it 's the perfect combination of advantages of big and small city . 
  from the cities i visited i liked l'viv the most . 
  but not for living . 
  i like to be able to use hot water at any time of the day , 
  now it does n't count . 
  i did n't even took shaving machine , cause i shaved once every 10 days at the time . 
  that 's what the regular soldiers were told . 
   same could happend in warsaw , but we 'll never know that . 
  it have n't happened anywhere else , so why would it happen in warsaw ? 
  probabilities matter , you can not make decisions about people lives treating 1 % , 50 % , and 80 % probabilities the same , because `` we ca n't know '' . 
   curicumstances changed , nobody could predict that circumastances were : we hope russians will help us to prevent them from taking warsaw by themselves . 
  it was a long shot . 
   sure , becouse we ca n't remember everything , it must be competition between different regions , cities or events . 
  we seem to only remember stuff that happened to warszawa . 
  no successful polish uprising is celebrated . 
  there were such uprisings . 
  they are rarely even mentioned in history lessons . 
  there are no country-wide celebrations . 
  it 's just wrong . 
  it teaches `` beautiful failures '' over `` practical victories '' . 
  it 's not the right lesson to teach future generations . 
   if the leftys prefferes to shit on the poles and their history , than do n't be suprised if the othersd takes care of it being realistic is `` shitting '' on polish history . 
  yeah i am . 
  i have other advantages . 
   everybody will die eventually . 
  instead of making up the alternative scenarios this was n't `` eventually '' and `` alternative scenario '' . 
  they were are going to die in few months . 
  they knew this and we know this . 
  in that case fighting lost fight made sense . 
   accept the reality and respect the polish resistance same way you ( probably ) respect the jewish one ? 
  i respect the people doing the fighting the same . 
  i just think their commanders were stupid and should be condemned for treason , and not glorified . 
  and i also think warszawa-based media should really learn to tell the stories of the whole poland , and not only warszawa . 
  because warszawa was just small part of polish population , and history of the rest of poland is ignored . 
  and i think right-wing organisations trying to take over warsaw uprising for modern political fights are doing great disservice to poland . 
  you mean b\u00f3r komorowski or hitler ? 
  btw warszawa is kind of ugly . 
  genocide ^ i ^ was ^ told ^ it ^ works ^ as ^ ultimate ^ argument ^ against ^ germans, 
  we have these too in polish . 
  in regular days you can use `` szcz\u0119\u015b\u0107 bo\u017ce '' ( may god give you happines ) instead of `` dzie\u0144 dobry '' ( good morning ) , people use it to very often to greet priests/nuns , and rarely with other people . 
  also instead of `` dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 '' ( thank you ) you can say `` b\u00f3g zap\u0142a\u0107 '' ( god - repay )  it 's funny how we order god to pay for us  there 's also a few other , previous priest from my home village used like 10 different god-related greetings each time he visited us , and nobody knew how to answer  i think he was doing this on purpose . 
  stuff like `` pok\u00f3j temu domowi '' ( may the peace be with this house ) . 
  but overall 99 % of the time people just use nonreligious greetings . 
   \u010ctvrt how do you read that ? 
  because when i do it sounds like i 'm reloading a gun . 
  yeah i 've heard . 
  at least you got great songs from that . 
  http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.595873  chechen leader denies sending troops to ukraine pro-russian leader of restive region says any chechens in ukraine are there independently . 
  march 2014 . 
  this article :  `` volunteers were over there , but they are n't there anymore . 
  when the ceasefire was going on , all of our volunteers were called back : come back , stay home ... now there should n't be a single person over there . 
  our hooligans who were over there , we brought them back , '' 2015 i wonder how you call back every single one of independend volunteers so they listen . 
  my guess - you stop paying them . 
  most return , some switch sides . 
  you do a lot of fasting , 
   the people of warsaw wanted to rise . 
  100 % of them . 
  sure . 
  at any rate - the commanders lying to people about the chances are at fault . 
   yeah , and in case of the full soviet offensive nobody would have died and nothing would have been demolished ... much less people would die . 
  the whole idea of arguing if the guerilla fighters were `` lefty '' or `` righty '' is immensely stupid . 
  the political scene was very different , and it was secondary to survival and independence . 
  using political beliefs of these people to make your case today is just as dumb , as saying socialists today are better polish patriots , because pi\u0142sudski was a socialist when poland regained independence . 
  because they would all die anyway few months later in death camps . 
  think sometimes . 
  it was heroic and all , but the current narrative about it in poland is increasingly owned by right-wing media and organisations . 
  it 's very hard to say anything critical about warsaw uprising , because right-wingers will start screaming `` traitor '' and `` leftist '' . 
  and there were a lot of downsides : hundreds of tousands of people died . 
  warsaw was demolished . 
  nothing was achieved . 
  the decision to start the uprising was controversial at the time , and tousands of poles in warsaw were effectively forced to take part in it , despite the low chances after russian betrayal . 
  also - there was other , successful uprising in poland in ww2 , and nobody speaks about it . 
  warsaw uprising is somehow publicized everywhere like it was the only important thing during ww2 . 
  it 's another sign of warsawocentrism in polish media . 
  it makes me sad . 
  clearly english need declension , 
  literally everything you experience changes the structure of brain . 
  that 's how we form memories . 
  and yes - porn can be addicting , but it 's one of the least harmful addictions you can get , because it 's self-limiting ( how much time you can spend masturbating per day ? ) . 
  i 'd say internet , gaming , gambling , tv , and a lot of other stuff is much more harmful . 
  it 's like that for most of the common words . 
  they just use cyrylic to make it hard to read , 
  yes . 
  and lasted a few months , few years at most each time . 
  combined it 's less than 20 years . 
  you do n't decline these ? 
  damn cryptogermans .
