  also - i kinda understand the need for walls around russian embassy in poland , 
  oh , right . 
  you do n't have to read `` war and peace '' , or `` crime and punishment '' in schools in russia ? 
  or do you just nto like them ? 
  i thought they were great ( even though obviously we see history from different pov in poland ) . 
  poland ( no particular order ) : - `` the peasants '' by noble winner ** w\u0142adys\u0142aw reymont ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_peasants - great book about lives of peasants in small village in poland during partitions . 
  just a very good portrait of interesting period , and interesting ( but simple ) people . 
  - `` ferdydurke '' by ** witold gombrowicz ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdydurke - kinda abstract/absurd book about people trying to escape the need to conform to society expectations , and failing , repeatedly . 
  imho top 3 polish book . 
  - `` solaris '' ** stanis\u0142aw lem ** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solaris_%28novel%29 - hard sci-fi about how naive our expectations of contact with alien life are . 
  the best `` alien '' in sci-fi . 
  aliens from `` blindsight '' are close second place . 
  - `` white and red '' ** dorota mas\u0142owska ** http://www.amazon.co.uk/white-red-dorota-maslowska/dp/1843544237 - book about young people from society margin in modern poland . 
  they are called dresiarze ( polish chav equivalent ) . 
  - `` the last wish '' ** andrzej sapkowski ** ( it 's short stories collection , not a novel , but imho it 's the best sapkowski has to offer - his novel are a little worse than short stories ) - postmodern fantasy , a combination of chandler detective antihero + slavic and ee fairy tales plots + what would life in tolkien fantasy world look like if it was n't a fairy tale but a real world . 
  notable absents : shame that `` ice '' by ** jacek dukaj ** is n't translated , because otherways i would choose it over `` white and red '' . 
  also shame it 's xxth and xxist century only , because `` the doll '' by ** boles\u0142aw prus ** is also polish top 3 book , and it 's only 20 years too old to be here . 
  ** ryszard kapu\u015bci\u0144ski ** - i just do n't like his books . 
  ** henryk sienkiewicz ** - his books are fun , and very popular , but not so good to make it into top 5 . 
  he is a polish dumas . 
  ** antoni go\u0142ubiew ** his novels about boles\u0142aw chrobry are great , but again - no english translation . 
  ** jolanta chmielewska ** her `` ironic crime stories '' are great , and very funny , she sold 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 copies in russia and 6 000 000 in poland , still no english translation . 
  uk : monthy python and the saint grail . 
  spain : the nympho 's diary . 
  asking that question in english is kinda funny , 
   there has been a treaty , you know ? 
  you mean the iran treaty ? 
  imho it 's wise to keep working on the shield . 
  there has been usa-russian reset recently , and look how it ended . 
  as they say : `` speak softly and carry a big stick '' . 
  it 's not politincorrect , it 's just incorrect . 
  yes , it 's `` holandia '' in polish , but they mistranslated that into english . 
  well , if you compare state media ( 100 % dumb shit propaganda 16 hours each day ) to rfe ( sometimes misleading ) it 's still obvious which is better . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  half of poland listened to it in 80s . 
  first informations about czarnobyl catastrophe came from the west through rfe . 
  it probably saved some lives . 
  radio free europe worked out . 
  small high-readines aeromobile battle-group operating on russian territory eliminating people that write propaganda on the internet . 
  anything less is a half-measure . 
  poland . 
  no , 7 cases in all the dialects i know . 
  nominative is sometimes used instead of vocative , but it 's the same everywhere in poland , it 's not specific to one dialect . 
  we have bia\u0142ystok dialect , which uses preposition `` dla '' ( for ) in places where regular polish does n't , and consequently it uses different case with these verbs , but it still has all the cases , just uses them differently . 
  english equivalent would be `` tell for him '' instead of `` tell him '' . 
  the funniest thing is - he complains that he is quoted out of context , and that media falsify his image by showing only controversial statements . 
  but no matter what you ask - in the end he says sth like the above quotes  and btw he thinks global warming is a scam . 
  according to korwin-mikke it was probably fault of heinrich himmler , who have n't informed hitler of his deeds . 
   everybody has the right to exercise and take part in competitions . 
  we should only be glad that invalids do . 
  but it has nothing to do with sport , it 's like chess for idiots . 
  ...  in society there is a rule - you become like people with whose you contact . 
  so - watching ( otherwise impresive ) - strugles of para-sportsmen - can cause ( fortunately temporary ) - problems with movement coordination . 
  if we want for humanity to develop - we should show healthy , pretty , strong , honest , wise people in tv , and not perverts , murderers , weaklings , losers , idiots , and invalids - unfortunately . 
  he 's like a mine of dumb and offensive quotes . 
  somebody created this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuus79gpnjg , 
  btw currently the most promising scientific theory says , that women are on average as intelligent as men , but the variability is higher for men ( there are more of both unusually dumb and unusualy inteligent men than women ) . 
  basicaly this : https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/blogs/54311/2011/01/54391-45190.png?itok=pxhofisv this is probably caused by the repeated x chromosome in women , when men have only 1 copy of it . 
  in female brain half of the cells have x chromosome inherited from mother , and half from father . 
  in male brain - all the cells have the same x chromosome - from mother . 
  so there 's less averaging-out in men .

  this is one of his least controversial statements , too . 
   the poles do n't like us because we 're coward and mostly atheist nah . 
  we laught at you because of that , not dislike you . 
  the worst thing in our relations is your weird attitude towards russia , and the recent anti-polish-food campaign . 
  still you are probably in top 3 most liked neighbors . 
  looking at the table - it does n't seem that countries with more black people have higher rates . 
  uk why are your laws so dumb ? 
  somehow in poland i 's legal to rip cds . 
  so i really doubt it 's eu . 
  ru\u015b / rusini is usually translated as ruthenia/ruthenians . 
  it was on napoleon side , 
  they could n't force ussr out of ee either , 
  there is no lower distance limit ? 
  cities closer than 100km should have line in red , that 's all . 
  would n't it be better to just show dots for each city ? 
  the lines add no information in such case , and just make it harder to see the clusters . 
  it 's missing many cities . 
  in poland there should be 39 dots for example . 
  also the visualization is strange - it covers the map on average proportionaly to the square of the number of the cities ( because for n cities there are ( n ^ 2 - n ) / 2 lines between them ) . 
  so if your country has 3 times more cities - it looks 9 times as `` covered '' on this map ( depending also on their placement ) . 
  edit : ok , so it apparently do n't show cities that are 150 + km from another city with  100 000 population . 
  then it 's not incorect , but i wonder what was the reasoning behind such criterium . 
  both are occupied by russians . 
  i 'm sure quality of life in donbas and crimea is great right now . 
  why should lithuanians care russians have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_syndrome ? 
  should be kebab or pizza in poland , but i guess it 's hard to collect stats from 1000s of these places , and mcdonald is much easier . 
  divisions differ in different countries . 
  i 've never heard term `` northern europe '' used in poland . 
  in poland most used division is `` the west '' which starts at germany and includes everything from there , also italy , spain , scandinavian countries , and usa . 
  sth similar to southern europe is sometimes used , but we call them `` mediterranean countries '' , and sth similar to northern europe is used , but we call them `` scandinavians '' ( it does n't include baltic states of course ) . 
  there 's `` the east '' , which includes russia , ukraine , belarus , sometimes also romania , balkans and baltic states . 
  then there 's central europe which includes poland , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , sometimes baltic states . 
  also some people in poland consider germany and austria `` central europe '' , but most think they are `` the west '' . 
  i do n't really care , in english i use english terms , in polish i use polish terms . 
  it 's not like ee stereotypes are going to remain forever . 
  depends . 
  in places with well preserved architecture like krak\u00f3w , toru\u0144 , lublin - nope , at least nowhere near old town . 
  in cities where there is nothing to lose ( communists messed up already by building socrealist housing and commiblocks in old town ) , or with fake old towns - no problem .
