  feel free to advocate for your country to exit nato . 
  let other countries be in it . 
  `` niderlandy '' is sometimes used , mostly in historic context , but still much less often than holandia . 
  while i agree russia was always european country , i disagree it was western european . 
   their whole history was hand-in-hand with europe 's until 1918 . 
  monarchs , authoritarianism , the whole deal . 
  russia had no renneisance , no reformation , no contrreformation , no `` spring of peoples '' in 1848 . 
  industrialization happened mostly in xxth century , there was no democratic government to speak of since novogrod merchant republic . 
  it 's hardly `` hand-in-hand '' with western europe. , and it 's ok - the circumstances were just diffferent . 
  another important differences - russia freed peasants significantly later than western & central european countries . 
  and collectivised farming just 2 generations later . 
  also  oligarchy , as many western countries in the recent past . 
  which ones ? 
  is n't it wise to join forces against aggression ? 
   p.s : not all superpowers have to be like america and prey on tiny , weak ( ? ), 
  oil abundant countries . 
  - . - ' russia seems to work exactly like that . 
   are you telling me latin emerged from slavic ? 
  come off !!!, 
  both emerged from common ancestor , and slavic is closer to latin than many people think . 
  for example they have similar declension rules , perfect-imperfect division , no articles , and both use 7 cases ( this i 'm saying basing on knowledge of polish , maybe other slavic languages lost some cases , at any rate common slavic had 7 cases like latin ) . 
  if you consider grammar rules - modern romance languages are further from latin , than slavic languages . 
  yes the animation had some errors ( for example there should be ruthenian , not russian before dividing into ukrainian/russian/belarussian ) . 
  and the dates are wrong . 
  i have n't missed it . 
  putin did . 
  russia anexed part of sovereign country , how is this not a `` conquering spree '' ? 
  it 's still keeping its soldiers in many countries against will of their governments ( ossetia , transdniestria , eastern ukraine ) . 
  it fought at least 4 wars in last 20 years . 
  it brainwash population , and falsify history . 
  it persecute minorities ( lgbt for one example ) . 
  it forbids foreign ngos , it censors internet , it 's common for journalists to be killed there . 
  it 's not totalitarian , but it sure is authoritarian country , and it gets worse quickly . 
  how much do you think it was worth to pay to avoid ww2 ? 
  because hitler could only start it because democratic countries decreased military spending and were generaly pacifistic . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_%281920%29, 
  if it were n't for us , you 'd all be speaking turkish / s or russian for that matter . 
  why compare hungary to landlocked countries outside europe . 
  that 's their purpose . 
  and rossija 1 just has different approach to 1968 intervention in czechoslovakia  i mean zeman wanted to go to putin celebrations of ww2 and was against sanctions . 
  your president seems to like them , though ? 
  eastern poland likes russia even less than western poland . 
  average size of farm per farmer http://www.wspolczesna.pl/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?site=gw&amp;date=20130913&amp;category=rolnictwo01&amp;artno=130909731&amp;ref=ar&amp;border=0&amp;maxw=500 eastern and central poland has more people in countryside - families living there lived there for centuries , farms were divided between kids , they got smaller and more uniformly populated . 
  north west poland was given to poland and settled almost from scratch in 1945 - so farms are bigger , and more people live in cities , so there is more place for wildlife between towns and villages . 
  also overall population density is lower ( except poznan and wroc\u0142aw region ) . 
  for comparison . 
  overall population density http://rivers.icm.edu.pl/images/5/5e/pop_density.png countryside population density http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/maps/pz2.jpg average farm size http://www.wspolczesna.pl/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?site=gw&amp;date=20130913&amp;category=rolnictwo01&amp;artno=130909731&amp;ref=ar&amp;border=0&amp;maxw=500 not only boar-rich regions have less people - additionally less of them live in countryside , and each farmer has bigger fields there , so there 's more space between buildings . 
  population density map . 
  http://rivers.icm.edu.pl/images/5/5e/pop_density.png and population in `` poland b '' is more uniformly distributed , while in `` poland a '' you have a lot of forests , and fields - in poland b these are smaller and more often interrupted by small villages . 
  he is a pupet of kaczy\u0144ski , as anti-russian as it gets . 
  this is the best solution . 
  thanks , but i thought kasparov is outside russia ? 
  i am agnostic and i go to church occasionaly for the singing . 
  it 's great , especially on pasterka . 
  are there any putin critics you heard of that are alive and well and live in russia ? 
  it 's reasonable for a country at war to prohibit distributing information of military operations during peace ? 
  they just go for a short trip to czech republic or germany . 
  give them all possible sporting events . 
  the sooner they default the sooner the war stops . 
  nope . 
  at least - not only . 
  he also needs to keep ukraine a shithole so russians do n't start to get wrong ideas . 
  obviously it 's not . 
  ukraine in eu and nato with russia keeping crimea would be still very bad for dreams of russian empire . 
  god forbid it would start to develop quickly and people in russia would see that they too can have democracy and prosperity at once . 
  otherways why putin started this whole donetsk and lughansk after crimea ? 
  still poor . 
  keep investing in eastern poland . 
  ukraine is anything but irrelevant for russia . 
  and what are you going to do then ? 
  i like how they chain themselves to these huge ugly chimneys that evaporate pure h2o to cool stuff . 
  poland actually tried to create a colony in africa between ww1 and ww2 . 
  it was a hilarious failure . 
  at least no violence was used . 
  the problem is : 1 % out of a few tousands is  0 . 
  0 % out of hundreds tousands is still 0 . 
   going to look at me as a slav is that a thing ? 
  never had a problem outside 4han . 
  i really , really doubt czech republic had influenced middle east . 
  it 's funny how i always considered czechs less xenephobic than poles . 
  i guess grass always seems greener on the other side . 
  there are reasonable environmentalists and unreasonable ones . 
  i mean - greenpeace is just a scam , and people doing black pr for nuclear energy should pay the families of people that died due to coal industry ( only practical alternative to nuclear for most countries ) . 
  more people died due to coal than due to all nuclear catastrophes including czarnobyl . 
  not counting nuclear bombs of course . 
  but yeah , some things environmentalists say are sensible . 
  uusually it 's half-sensible , like with fracking - you can do it the cheapset way and make a mess , or you can do it properly and einvironment will be ok . 
  should have changed title to `` putin 's party lost local elections in kaliningrad '' or sth like that . 
  current title says nothing about the article . 
  i thought you refered to russian soldiers making vacations in ukraine . 
  poland : - toru\u0144 city ( central poland ) - it 's well preserved medieval city , part of the german-style poland , place where copernicus was born , and it 's just very nice for a few days . 
  there 's planetarium , nice riverside of vistula , but the main attraction is the old town . 
  - lublin city ( eastern poland ) - place where polish-lithuanian commonwealth was created , very important city in commonwealth during renneisance and baroque , has great renneisance-baroque old town , in unique lublin reneneisance style ( a mix of polish , italian , and ruthenian architecture ) . 
  completely different from well-known polish cities . 
  also it lies on hills over valleys of 3 rivers - makes for a great views . 
  there 's a castle , a german death camp from ww2 - majdanek ( better preserved than auschwitz ) , wooden architecture museum , botanic garden , underground passages in the old town , and a lot of great architecture . 
  and there 's few tourists , as only recently the city became accessible from abroad ( there 's an airport there since 2012 ) . 
  small sample http://static.panoramio.com/photos/1920x1280/78731887.jpg - also in less than 1,5 hour drive from lublin you can see zamo\u015b\u0107 ( city created in xvith century by one man and one architect as a perfect renneisance town - unesco heritage place ) , koz\u0142\u00f3wka palace , and kazimierz dolny ( small and very pretty town by the vistula river , `` bohemian '' place - lots of painters , singers , folk artists , and tourists , but mostly poles - foreigners do n't usually go there ) . 
  all of these are worth seeing for a few hours . 
  - bieszczady mountains - small mountains in south-eastern poland , the most wild part of poland , with the least population density .
