  and regular russians wo n't do revolution anyway . 
   but they ca n't admit it because being ill is a sign of weakness , therefore gay , therefore illegal in russia . 
  i 'm not buyin this part of analysis people do , i think it 's stretching the cultural differences too far and making conclusions from that . 
  sometimes western analysis of russia seems to think of them as alien species . 
  boris jelcyn had heart attacks and still was in power , he lost it for other reasons . 
  i can easily imagine russian propaganda shwoing putin in hospital for routine operation or whatever , russians praing for him in churches , etc. 
  siting on golden throne , a machinery that has to be fed 1000 russians each day to keep the beloved emperor alive , he is the last stand of the empire of man against chaotic and depraved homosex . 
  should have learnt esperanto . 
  tbh he has a lot more to work with ( than most previous defence ministers ) thanks to putin . 
  yes , that 's obvious . 
  the problem is - what 's more profitable - to defend poland , or to let it go , buy time , and make another alliance/start remilitarization . 
  i hope the first , but i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  i think if shtf germany would help us ( bordering aggressive dictatorship is bad for business , believe me ) , usa too ( fortunately obama is not going to be there forever ) , and i 'm not sure about the rest countries . 
   such action as it deems necessary : / if you want to be technical about it ( as countries are about budapest agreement that specified these countries will `` protect ukraine '' , but said nowhere how it should be done ) - you can deem nessesary to send strong concerns . 
  the only city in poland with substantial `` following '' right now is krak\u00f3w . 
  example song about krak\u00f3w `` nie przeno\u015bcie nam stolicy do krakowa '' ( do n't move our capital to krak\u00f3w [ it 's better off without ] ) . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkq5n7ywege before ww2 , the biggest such sentiment was in lw\u00f3w ( now l'viv , ukraine ) , there was even a song popular in the whole poland ( still everybody know it ) - `` tylko we lwowi '' ( only in lw\u00f3w ) . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhbiahiddj8 lw\u00f3w had opinion of city of poor but educated and happy people . 
  it had huge influence on polish culture . 
  i 'd say it was polish california  warsaw has rather bad opinion of being ugly , boring , serious business city . 
  of course there are also songs that show warszawa in good light , but they are mostly popular in warszawa . 
  nope . 
  to be honest it could very well be accident - kaczy\u0144ski was known for bullying pilots to fly and land in bad conditions when it was politicaly important ( even though it 's illegal for president to order pilots during a fly ) . 
  you just need to shoot through earth . 
  that would be sexist . 
  mother ? 
  mu : ter . 
  mater . 
  i do n't know more . 
  look it up . 
  we have 3 kinds : - sour ( `` fermented '' for a long time ) = og\u00f3rek kiszony - less sour ( `` fermented '' for short time ) = og\u00f3rek ma\u0142osolny - sweet/vinegar = og\u00f3rek konserwowy, 
  - nica is a postfix that means roughly `` of sth '' . 
  piv-nica means `` of drinking '' or more likely `` of beer '' ( pi\u0107 = to drink , pivo = beer = sth to drinkg ) . 
  bo\u017c-nica means `` of god '' . 
  so no , not related . 
  early churches in poland were often fortified , they were also one of the few buildings made of stone , and gothic style was looking `` defensive '' . 
  so i guess castle and church looked similar to these people . 
  curse of resources . 
  if not for resources russia would go the same way baltic states did , diversify , and build modern economy by now . 
  instead they had oil and gas so they could skip the uncomfortable part and jump straight into consumptionism . 
  or so they thought . 
  in polish it was also mied\u017awied\u017a , but people changed it since then . 
  you can see it 's the case because diminuitive is `` mi\u015b '' , not `` ni\u015b '' . 
  also ved is n't from wie\u015b\u0107 ( to lead ) , but from je\u015b\u0107 ( to eat ) . 
   b\u00f3g or boh means `` god '' and it comes from a word `` bogactwo '' ( richness ) . 
  b\u00f3g means god , but i really doubt bogactwo came from b\u00f3g . 
  i suspect it 's the other way around . 
  btw bogaty ( god-ish ) = rich , ubogi ( in god 's ) = poor . 
  because fuck logic . 
  half of countries in europe had superpower status at some point . 
  they border canada and mexico . 
  it can last forever . . 
  he started it , that 's completely different , 
  l\u0105k, 
  btw sweden gib back art stolen during deluge !, 
  i knew it was homogays all along . 
  do you believe in testosteron or is it cultural myth ? 
  yup , that 's my guess as well . 
  we just started from scratch on equal ( + - ) conditions . 
  i meant the soldiers killed in ukraine . 
  you missed the oportunity to make a title like `` number of metro lines in warsaw doubled this year '' . 
  edit actually make that `` in poland '' . 
  lead poisoning is on the rise , on the other hand . 
  you conveniently ignored the problem of slightly sexist conscription criteria . 
  you are men so you will die for your country . 
  the fact that feminists do n't care , but cry over details like 30 % or 40 % in high earning jobs just shows they do n't care about equality , just about more priviledges . 
  and the funniest thing is - the sexist conscription makes sense from biological standpoint . 
  as some other sexist biases do . 
  but feminist only protest these they do n't like . 
  i 've seen counterexamples , but rare . 
  and the proffesion is called babcia klozetowa for a reason ( toilet grandma ) . 
  nobody has a problem with infantry or miners being mostly men . 
  equality only works one-way . 
  it helped that there were no united germany for most of polish history  , but yes , we were friends especialy with saxony . 
  we mostly got problems with prussia and brandenburg . 
  also france is surprisingly ok with inequality . 
  got no idea tbh . 
  there 's pa\u0142ac branickich in bia\u0142ystok , but it 's well , a palace . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/bia%c5%82ystok%2c_pa%c5%82ac_branickich_%28pn-wsch%29.jpg/450px-bia%c5%82ystok%2c_pa%c5%82ac_branickich_%28pn-wsch%29.jpg i 've checked it on the internet and there is just on surviving castle in podlasie - in tykocin , and it was reconstructed from scratch , so i do n't know if it counts . 
  http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plik:podlaskie_-_tykocin_-_tykocin_-_dw671_-_zamek_-_e_-_v-wsw_-_20100724.jpg no point in building castles between 2 allies apparently . 
  in poland ? 
  where ? 
  we 've been pushed few hundred km west , so it 's weird there 's still sth lithuanian in poland ? 
  we mostly got castles from germany , and left ours to ukraine and belarus .

  this assumes these people would n't find a wife in their country , and have kids with them instead.which is very unlikely . 
  not deeply concerned fortunately . 
  nationalism is result , not the reason . 
  see rise of nationalism in eu after the crisis . 
  culture is important once you have food , shelter , warmth , social interactions and job secured . 
  before that nobody cares about culture . 
  and if you get your basic needs from state - and the only alternative you see is chaotic 90s - you will probably support the state and rationalize something to feel better . 
  that 's modern russia ( plus it 's easy to blame usa/jews/liberals / traitors for the fact that you are jobless , poor and drunk ) . 
  other polish songs about ireland : `` irlandia zielona '' ( green ireland ) by kowalski https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8zagmnmtri `` ajrisz '' ( irish written phoneticaly in polish ) by t love https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vpefc_6kig there 's more but these 3 are the most known . 
  poles like ireland very much . 
  `` bo\u017ce co\u015b polsk\u0119 '' = `` god , who to poland '' ( yes , its ' not a whole sentence , in polish title it 's the same - it 's just the first line from the song ) . 
  both `` rota '' and `` my , pierwsza brygada '' were candidates for a polish anthem in the interwar period , but in the end `` mazurek d\u0105browskiego '' won . 
  which btw should also be there  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=debhiaqh3ps, 
  oh , sorry , i misread your previous post ( i thought `` i got all the resources i need '' refered to russian resource , ignore my previous comment . 
  change flair .
