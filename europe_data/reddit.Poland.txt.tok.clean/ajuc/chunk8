  it 's ending already , most of eu is growing quite nicely , despite this russian shit . 
   1/3 of the population would have to move abroad like it happened with some baltic states or romania , the most pro-eu ones . 
  right ... 1/3rd of romania migrated . 
  that would be 21/3 = 7 000 000 people . 
  i wonder where did you get that idea from . 
  and ukraine is 2 times bigger , so that would be 14\u00a0000\u00a0000 people . 
  good one . 
  somehow there was no 14\u00a0000\u00a0000 strong polish emigration . 
   so you purpose a painful way that will take several decades to reach level of poland which is actually very similar to russian economical level i propose a plan that will make ukraine develop like a normal country eventually . 
  you propose dependence on russian fossil fuels till they run out or somebody invents something that makes them obsolete . 
  one of these things will happen in next 40 years . 
  and in the meanwhile ukraine will be russian puppet state , ruled by one incompetent jerk after another , with endemic corruption , sliding into backwardness year after year . 
  when to free lunch is over it will be in the same place it 's now in , but the whole world will be 40 years forward . 
  way better . 
  it 's their choice , anyway . 
  i would just prefer if russians kept their tanks home if ukrainians choose eu . 
  btw russian level is only similar to polish if you compare moscow to warsaw or petersburg to krak\u00f3w . 
  compare village in eastern poland to remote village in russia and you will see quite big differences . 
  poor poor kazakhstan has resources and does n't want to do the russian bullshit with wars so it can use the resources for better living standards and development instead . 
  therefore it has bigger economical potential than russia that uses considerable part of its resources to keep pretending it 's a superpower and meddling with neighbors . 
  china regains its position , and russia and ukraine will too . 
  it 's just that russia ( without ukraine , poland , baltic states etc ) natural position is below modern level , while ukraine is above modern level , similar to other post-soviet countries . 
  so again - ukraine has better economic potential than russia . 
  russia has dozen times the surface area and only under 3 times the population of ukraine . 
  it 's much better internal market , that + good law will encourage investment , meanwhile russia is cutting itself off foreign investment . 
  the only problem for ukraine is to stop the war with russia-by-proxy . 
  and it will happen , only thing in doubt is how big part of territory putin will get . 
  maybe none at all ? 
  we will see . 
  regarding how ukraine could do that - simple . 
  just do what poland , romania and others did . 
  a few years of hardships and then decades of fast development . 
  it was done many times in nineties , in countries very similar to ukraine . 
  you do n't even need to export more than import to grow fast , when you 're as big country as ukraine . 
  for example poland gdp grew 2.5 times since 1989 and for the whole time except the last year we imported more than exported . 
  and we were on roughly ukrainian level in 1989 . 
  imagine somebody tried to explain google , twitter , facebook and smartphones to you in 1990 with all the consequences . 
  sci-fi man . 
  a cellphone or internet would ruin half of the movie plots from eighties . 
  so , he was known to go to work at hospital drunk , but only after it turned out he collects penises everybody started to be concerned ? 
  i think perfect ai translators will make such problems go away in the next 10-20 years anyway , and then there will be 1000s of languages in eu alone ( because people would be able to understand each other anyway so no pressure to unify languages even in one country - without the translators after a few decades people living in countryside wo n't understand city dwellers 20 km away ) . 
  so the problem will turn from social to technical , and then whoever tinkers with the translator ai will be able to change the whole world politics at will . 
   higher living standards and economical potential the ukraine . 
  living standards i agree , but potential ? 
  i doubt it . 
  belarus is a small , land-locked dictatorship completely dependent on russia . 
  russia will sanction itself ( and be sanctioned ) to economic collapse in next decade or so . 
  kazakhstan probably has the biggest potential from these countries . 
  btw : do you think china has low economic potential , too , 
   but where 's the proooooof ? 
  we have this too , very popular : `` na bezrybiu i rak ryba '' = `` on no-fish-zone crab is a fish too '', 
  http://www.alvernia.com/wp-content/galleries/about-us/onas.jpg http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/alvernia_studios, 
  we have `` prawda jest jak dupa [ ka\u017cdy ma swoj\u0105 ] '' = `` the truth is like ass [ everybody has its own ] '' . 
  - when something is useless : `` to o kant dupy rozbi\u0107 '' = '' [ only use for this is ] to break/crush it against the edge of your ass '' . 
  pronounciation : https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/to%20o%20kant%20dupy%20rozbi%c4%87 - when someone is uptight ( overly focused on style , thinking he 's better than anyone else ) . 
  `` on jest taki \u0105 \u0119 '' = `` he 's so \u0105 \u0119 '' . 
  https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/on%20jest%20taki%20%22%c4%85%22%20%22%c4%99%22 that 's because people in regular polish say \u0105 and \u0119 at the end of verbs almost unnoticably , often turning them into `` a '' and `` e '' . 
  people that are overcorrect stress these letters to show they know they 're there , sometimes even mistakenly add them where it 's really just `` a '' and `` e '' . 
  it 's funny and people laugh them off . 
  - `` kurwa '' - can work as any other word and mean anything . 
  mostly used as '' , '' https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/kurwa - `` oj tam oj tam '' = `` so what so what '' , or `` cry me a river '' but a little different ( without the angry tone cry me a river has ) . 
  can be response to almost any complaint , and it means you acknowledge , but think it 's not that big a deal , and anyway do n't worry be happy man . 
  hakuna matata almost  https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/oj%20tam%20oj%20tam - `` m\u00f3wi\u0107 drutem kolczastym '' = `` to speak barbed wire '' = to speak german  https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/m%c3%b3wi%c4%87%20drutem%20kolczastym, 
  would be women 's summer at best . 
  baba never suggests a young girl , it 's either old woman , or just women , without specified age . 
  you are now eligible for polish intermediate certificate . 
  right , lublin should be between krak\u00f3w and vilnius or warsaw and l'viv . 
  warsaw < -  lublin < -  krak\u00f3w is a little weird and not in a straight line . 
  it would be better to do a triangle : warsaw < -  krak\u00f3w warsaw < -  lublin < - l'viv krak\u00f3w < -  lublin < - vilnius it 's all in straight lines then . 
   the nation states do not represent the people any more than the current bureaucracy in brussels of course they do . 
  your vote has more power if its 's 1 from 30\u00a0000\u00a0000 possible than when it 's 1 from 350\u00a0000\u00a0000 possible . 
  and most countries are even smaller than poland , and you get only 5 000 000 voters or so . 
  the political debates in differen eu countries are n't even about the same things . 
  if you had one huge country instead of 25 small ones most of these debates would cease to exist ( but the underlying problems would n't ) - you ca n't have elections with 100 political parties with reasonable time dedicated to each of them . 
  the most important problem for irish people wo n't matter for all the rest , same with problems of most of the eu population . 
  in the end the whole eu will only talk about what 's important for france and germany , and maybe a few fringe parties from other countries would get some time . 
  all the others would be ingnored and their problems unsolved forever . 
  this is the exact opposite of what we need to make democracy better . 
  we need more local democracy not less . 
  also i highly doubt you know in details political systems of all eu countries . 
  yet you seem to feel entitled to make sweeping generalizations about them . 
  regarding usa as an example for eu - usa are great as a military power keeping world more or less safe . 
  it 's also awful at education , health care , equality , it keeps in prison ridiculusly large part of its population ( half of black males were in prison before they were 25 y.o. 
  for example , 30 % of all young people ) , it has huge social frictions , whole regions are forgotten and people are just encouraged to move on somewhere else . 
  i do n't want that in eu . 
  it 's not a good goal for eu to become use . 
  because what happens on national scale ( small cities and poor regions get marginalized because of centralization ) will happen on eu scale ( smaller states will be marginalized and get even poorer ) . 
  the only people benefiting from that will be the ones living in former france and germany . 
  eu needs to be united because of economic benefits and security . 
  that does n't need countries to disappear . 
  just make common eu army and be done with it . 
  is n't voluntary admission ( this video ) good enough proof ? 
  or do you susggest the video is falsified ? 
  why all your eagles look silly ? 
  very hard to choose 1 . 
  i always wondered - at umcs there were 60 students on each year , and there were separate lady dealing with evening and weekend students . 
  at kul there were 100 people at each year , and one lady managed to do regular , weekend and evening students , and also another faculty . 
  and i 've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes at kul , while at umcs it sometimes took 2 hours . 
  of course umcs is state funded , while kul is sort-of private . 
  official hierarchy of importance at polish university : - student - cleaning lady - regular teacher - professor - dean - god - lady in the dean office btw it depends , i studied at kul and umcs in lublin , and kul had very quick bureaucracy ( but bad quality of teaching and low requirements ) .
