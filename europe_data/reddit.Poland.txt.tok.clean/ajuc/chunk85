  great read , as expected of eco . 
  i disagree with a few technical points . 
  i think modern fascist-like movements will work with legal majority thanks to populism and voting system manipulation . 
  at some point i thought internet allows to circumvent propaganda . 
  now i think it allows for precisely tailored propaganda at fraction of the cost . 
  i guess like old testament . 
   prophet says : `` god says - kill them all including kids and women and do n't take any prisoners '' [ 1 ]   editors notes : [ 1 ] god did n't actually mean that, 
  the problem in the end is money . 
  in 2013 retirement fund was already 21 % of the whole budget . 
  yes you can cut the budget , but it comes with other coss : fallin apart infrastructure , lack of investment , bad education , healthcare , etc. 
  with 50 % of budget going straight to pensioners ( very real threat ) - there is little you can do to keep economy and the state working . 
  you can '' t cut the budget by 30 % and not notice it . 
  italy : pizza ( shocking , i know ) , pasta with random vegetables and meat ( not real italian food i guess ) hungary : leczo, 
  i do n't know about slovakia , but the single biggest position in polish budget each year is subsidy to retirement fund ( 70 mld . 
  pln in 2013 , the whole budget was 321.3 mld . 
  it 's still maneagable , but if nothing changes in next 2 decades it wont be . 
  i found german much easier to learn than english . 
  not enough kids now = old society in a few decades = not enough people working to support people on retirement . 
  we cant `` make life good for people already in poland '' if those working do n't produce enough value to support good life for all of them . 
  i know dawid snopek 's blog . 
  he 's almost fluent now , but certainly was n't after 3 years of learning polish . 
  and he already knew some russian when he started . 
  btw russian is easier than polish . 
  it just makes it look harder by using different script . 
  btw2 the linked article has some mistakes `` czytam '' is not a correct translation of `` i have been reading '' for example . 
  btw3 in my private list of languages hard to learn english is one of the harder ones . 
  much harder than german ( which i was also learning in school ) . 
  the random spelling system of english is just insane . 
   also , cases are regular for the most part , right ? 
  there are a few sets of rules and some exceptions , you could theorethicaly learn them and remember which word uses which sets of rules . 
  nobody does that - you just learn what sounds right . 
  i agree polish is n't as hard as poles make it to be . 
  and btw it 's insane thing to be proud of . 
  but you seriously overestimate similarities between indo-european languages . 
  you can learn passable polish in a few years . 
  you wo n't be fluent in 3 years if you do n't already know slavic language . 
  they were both . 
  i 'm from lublin , i know many people that moved to uk or ireland . 
  it was a mix of people . 
  unemployed farmers ' kids , gray-area construction workers , fresh university graduates of useless degrees ( administration , anyone ? ) . 
  but also doctors , software develoeprs , network administrators . 
  2 of my coleegues from it worked in ireland for a few years , moved back , then moved to ireland again ( and they said they will do it again most probably , because you have to switch jobs every few years anyway not to stagnate , so why not change einvironment as well ) . 
  also i know a few developers from russia and ukraine , and there were quite a lot university teachers from ukraine on umcs even when i was studying ther ( 10 years ago ) . 
   i can see some poles complaining how ukrainians lowered wages and so on there are poles in warsaw complaining about poles from 50 km away lowering the wages etc  complaining is assumed , 
  main stated motivation was for polish minorities there to have option to return to poland . 
  many of them were descendants of forcibly expulsed poles after xixth century uprisings or from soviet and ww2 era relocations . 
  i agree it 's a little unsporting how it 's implemented . 
  one example of best immigrants in the world from belarus : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekvzki9hkzc he 's great , so it checks out . 
  `` no '' is the most common . 
  it 's also considered lower class and even rude by some people ( but it 's mostly older generation ) . 
  i was told `` na ` no ' to si\u0119 krowy gno '' ( with `` no '' you rush the cows ) when i used `` no '' as a child . 
  it may seem funny that `` no '' is `` yes '' in polish , but it 's not pronounced same as english `` no '' - it does n't have `` w '' sound at the end . 
  also iirc they use `` jo '' as `` yes '' in pozna\u0144 and pomerania , and `` ja '' in silesia . 
  and there are lots of words that are very often used for confirmation , but are n't technicly yes : `` aha '' , `` ok '' , `` dobra '' , `` jasne '' , `` w porz\u0105dku '' , etc. 
  and now pis uses same tactics in poland . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  you can not criticize anything government does because it 's `` buyuing into german anti-polish propaganda '' , and `` betraying poland '' . 
  it has authoritharian government and no free elections . 
  also economicaly . 
  in 2014 it had gdp per capita = 8000 usd compared to 16 000 usd in lithuania for example . 
  i suspect 2016 data is n't better .

  yes . 
  but if history is any evidence - you first occupy then trade . 
  leaving nazi germany be after ww2 and trading with it would n't work . 
   germany and france loathed each other . 
  it 's funny example , but you forgot to mention a minor detail - germany pacification after ww2 involved dividing it in half and occupying it for 50 years . 
  i do n't want to be as harsh on russia as you argue with your example , but i concede - it would probably work , and in such circumstances economic cooperation would be a good idea  i would even argue dividing in half part is not nessesary - japan example shows that just occupation suffices . 
  you got the causation ( and timing ) reversed . 
  not that i support current polish government . 
  but your deals with russia make it much harder . 
  it 's not that bad as far as defence experts go . 
  chief of parliament commision for defence - niesio\u0142owski was a few years ago invited to mainstream media for interview about defence . 
  he said that poland bought `` leonardo training tanks '' that are useless , and we should be instead building tanks in poland ( he meant leopards , and i do n't get why he thought these are training tanks ) , and that our f-16 are so fragile that enemy just has to throw some rubble on landing strip and they are grounded therefore they are also useless ( i do n't know what his implication was - that gripen can start from airfield covered in rubble probably ? ) . 
  i am constantly astonished how ignorant you can be and still be invited as expert by media . 
  i think tanks should be able to shoot in fog and rain as well , 
  it 's complicated , but it boils down to the decision to remain in russian sphere of influence , yes . 
  at least that 's the only clear common difference between ukraine/belarus and poland/estonia/lithuania / latvia/slovakia/czech republic/hungary/romania / ... as to why the russian system ( implemented in russia , ukraine , belarus ) works this way : http://www.pecob.eu/corruption-ukraine  as the data demonstrate , the most heavily corrupted domains of public administration are the most heavily regulated ones , where street-level bureaucrats exert considerable discretion over allowing , restricting or imposing sanctions or economic activities [ 2 ] . 
  corruption exists not because the state is `` weak '' , but because it is unaccountably strong , while there are little mechanism for citizen control of the administration . 
  ...  the russian sociologist ella paneyakh studied how petty entrepreneurs engage with what she calls `` formal rules of the game '' -- official regulations governing economic activity . 
  she found that these regulations are numerous and change frequently ( which is also true for ukraine ) , so that sometimes even agencies called to enforce them are unaware of the new changes and acknowledge that it is impossible to carry them out . 
  ...  in presence of informal institutions that modify how formal rules work , and eventually reduce the burden of state 's administrative control , corruption carries out an important economic function . 
  intertwined with mundane formal procedures , it works to reduce transaction costs and smooth sharp edges of business regulations . 
  as development studies scholars have recognized back in the 1970s , corruption can positively affect growth rates in the informal economy . 
  ...  but informal economy is hardly a solution to the acute problems of social development ukrainefaces now . 
  in the long run , it is costly , generates considerable uncertainty and insecurity , and stifles state revenues . 
  opening up opportunities for some , corruption cuts them for others . 
  pervasive bribery and a dysfunctional bureaucracy marginalizes the poor who are not able to pay the bribes , while the rich seem to find other ways to deal with the problem of malfunctioning formal rules and avoid paying bribes altogether , using powerful personal connections . 
  you can not create modern economy with a rule of law while being connected with corrupt russian economy . 
  or at least there are no examples of doing it in recent history . 
  you can develop a strong economy on your own and when you are strong enough you can enter russian market for additional profit ( taking the risk of corruption and randomly interpreted laws into account ) , but that 's another matter . 
  it 's rude to attribute to malice what can be sufficiently explained by ignorance/incompetence . 
  divide et impera . 
  if you can bully 1 of your customers without losing them all it 's much better than being only able to bully all of them or noone . 
  i have far-right keyboard . 
  it 's sth between these , closer to a5 . 
  probably because poland also has lots of 2a5 that wo n't be modernized for now . 
  btw what 's funny about the name ? 
  you mean the spelling difference between british and american english ? 
   also you are not as much dependent on conflicts like the one in the ukraine and other countries using gas as a tool for political pressure do you think the conflict would happen if russia had no other way to send gas west ?
