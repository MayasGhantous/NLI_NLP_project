  if you tried to raise issue of homosexuals in 1980s poland - you would be censored , because `` in polish people 's republic everybody is equal and free and we have no issues with homosexuals , stop spreading anti-polish propaganda '' . 
  same with sexism . 
  see for example https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/46a0ly/polish_magazine_depicting_islamic_rape_of_europe/d03uxed right wing propaganda in poland right now says that `` in western europe '' you ca n't blame refuges for antyhing even though their bands run amok and rape whatever moves . 
  a lot of people ( majority i 'd say ) actually believe that . 
  pis to differentiate from po ( and to win the elections ) started to praise some far right groups and propagate some of their views ( `` hools are the real patriots '' ) . 
  and they have support of majority of poles , and took over national media recently , so these views are mainstream now . 
  it 's sad to see the brainwashing going on . 
  still exactly as dumb . 
  it was . 
  hitler wanted jewish `` race '' dead , no matter their religion ( or citizenship ) . 
  baptizing would not save jews in poland . 
  nazis were after `` a race '' , not after religion . 
  he 's still wrong about the main target of death camps being poles . 
  poles were usually killed in local mass murders , death camps were mostly for jews ( no matter their citizenship or religion ) . 
  people confuse religion , citizenship , and nationality a lot . 
   yes , poles not jews , people who died in death camp were born in poland , speak polish oh stop it . 
  they were created to house oppositionists ( first prisoners were german political ones ) . 
  then they were used to keep prisoners of war , guerilla fighters , jews , muslims , homosexuals , and others . 
  some people were there just because they were polish , but it was n't the biggest group , nor anywhere close to it . 
  when germans wanted to kill poles they mostly did it on the spot , or in nearby forest . 
  see inteligenzionaktion . 
  the biggest group killed in deathcamps were jews . 
  and for nazis religion did n't matter , they wanted to `` solve '' problem of jewish nation , not religion . 
  stupid and harsh law should be criticised . 
  introducing dead laws is bad even when they are not stupid - because people learn to ignore laws in general . 
  i really dislike laws telling people what they can and can not say/print/whatever . 
  but it still is funny how people refer to the camps as `` nazi '' or `` polish '' but never `` german '' . 
  i think i 'll start calling them `` jewish '' to see if anybody will protest . 
  technicaly it was n't in poland . 
  it 's like calling mcdonald in l'viv a `` polish mcdonald '' because few years before that land was polish . 
  not that making a law about it is a good idea . 
  po also put them for consultations , and after strong criticism of many ngos they prepared corrections . 
  pis rejected all corrections and pushed the act thorugh unchanged ( as it does with everything - we can basicaly fire president and senate ) . 
  you are the one that brought up north korea . 
  people here are just complaining about stupid law . 
  for poles arguing that in poland we have freedom of speech unlike the western europe : - when someone calls you a racist for unpopular opinion it 's not against freedom of speech - when someone can sue you for unpopular opinion it is against freedom of speech, 
   they even made a pact with germany to cut up some country between them not true ( or provide a source that there wa a pact , it 's possible that i just never heard of it ) . 
  but we did cut off part of czechoslovakia when hitler took invaded it , so yeah . 
  in 1v1 it was ok . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war#conclusion but when ussr and nazi germany invade you at once it 's hard to defend . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's early 2000s russia . 
  if prl is anything to go by - dictatorship ( or more aproprietely authoritharianism ) is the most boring thing on earth . 
  freedom of press does n't mean people ca n't be outraged by your opinion . 
  well , there 's a lot of low hanging fruits . 
  freedom of speech protects you from censorship , not from criticism . 
  people misunderstand this a lot on the internet . 
  kurwa is all you need . 
  per day , 
  it 's like you never went to forest with grandparents to gather mushrooms . 
  nah , fries are relatively rare thing here . 
  mostly it 's cooked potato with some meat dish , soup , or potato dumplings or pancakes of various kinds . 
  we 're basicaly using them instead of pasta/rice . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potato_pancake https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kopytka https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyzy_ ( danie ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/placek_zb%c3%b3jnicki also with almost every meat dish there are : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kotlet_schabowy https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kotlet_mielony https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zrazy also with roast , steak , fried chicken , etc and with most soups : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borscht https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krupnik_ ( soup ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cucumber_soup https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sour_rye_soup you can probably eat polish potato dish every day for a month without repeating . 
  315 g of potatoes every day seems about right . 
  what 's unhealthy about that ? 
   we committed to a war we did n't want to figh when somebody invades you there 's no `` sorry i do n't want to fight '' option . 
  france had a choice to fight now or later , and it has chosen to fight later , alone , instead of now , together with poland . 
  it was much worse than treason - it was a strategic mistake that made ww2 possible . 
  and you seem not to have learnt anything . 
   could have easily ignored it like we did with every country before it . 
  would have had to fight germany that conquered ussr instead of just germany . 
  surely much better for you . 
  also there 's this simple fact that you failed to fullfil the treaty you signed . 
   the fact remains , we still joined the war stop pretending you did it out of good heart . 
  it was the only sensible option . 
  the alternative was to wait for hitler to conquer ussr ( which he wanted to do from the start ) . 
  i 'm sure ww2 without second front would go much better . 
  and you still fucked up , if you actually did what the alliance treaty specified you should do ( invade germany from the other side with significant force within 14 days of the start of the war ) - there would be no ww2 , and no holocaust . 
  instead you went there with small army and retreated after encountering mine field , then waited there doing nothing ... 
   because we lucked out in all the universes where we did n't - there 's nobody ( or at least orders of magnitude less people ) to perceive it . 
  it 's the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthropic_principle applied to geopolitics . 
  nazis were the first to ban smoking . 
  i imagine it would be a hard sell to reintroduce it in fifties , 
   there was quite literally , absolutely no legal difference in between the opportunities available for a man and woman that 's the problem with comparing stuff looking at the law only . 
  there was also freedom of speech written in law  and freedom of faith  and somehow my grandpa was fired from middle management in pgr ( a state-owned farm ) because he was seen in church ( yes , he was told it 's because of that by his boss ) . 
  i 'm talking about how it worked in practice - elections where 2 main candidates to be a country leader are both female ( last elections in poland ) would be impossible during communism . 
  poland had already 3 female prime ministers in last 25 years , and it had none during 50 years of communism . 
  a women in middle management ( even in small companies in backwater villages ) would be strange during communism , and now it 's nothing special . 
  btw even when you compare just the law and not practice - it was actually worse than now . 
  during communism men were drafted for 2 years to army ( later for 1 year ) . 
  women were n't . 
  now there 's no draft . 
  retirement age was different for man and women - now it 's the same . 
  the parental leave is now available for both parents . 
  there was expectation during communism that wife works `` anywhere '' , and husband may have a career , and the law was designed around that expectation . 
   quality of flats was n't really abysmal have you lived in commieblock for a long period of time ? 
  you can hear neighbors pissing . 
  energy efficiency was n't a thing . 
  first 10 years after communism every commieblock was clad with styrofoam ( and painted bright pink but that 's another matter ) . 
  they made flats with `` blind kitchens '' ( no windows in kitchen ) to save resources . 
  energy consumption went down 50 % in poland after  it was to highlight how many drastically positive changes were made transitioning into communism my point is - most of these good changes were n't really because of communism ( see healthcare/education - most of europe had similar changes no matter which side of iron curtain ) . 
  and the good stuff is still there . 
  and the mentality changed for the better since communism . 
  btw during communism there were ethnic cleansings ( in accordance with the law ) and mass expulsion basing on ethnicity ( and/or religion ) . 
  even as late as 1968 . 
  how is that `` progressive mentality '' ? 
  it 's simply that now there 's freedom , and before it was all propaganda , so ugly sides of ee mentality are visible now . 
  compare facts with facts , or theory with theory . 
   gender ... equality was present could you remind me - how many ussr ( or romanian , polish , hungarian , ... ) politicians/leaders were female ? 
  how about big national companies - how many women in the boards there ?
