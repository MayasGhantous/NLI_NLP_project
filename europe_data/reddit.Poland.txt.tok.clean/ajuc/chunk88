  because from what i remember it was much worse than now . 
  right now poland ( and i suspect other post-soviet countries ) have much better gender equality . 
  in soviet times it was equality if you wanted to be a tractor driver or a miner , but middle-management and up it was an old boys ' club . 
   university tuition was nationalized it still is . 
   health and dental care were priorities ( and it too , was nationalized ) it still is ( except some cosmetic dental care stuff ) . 
  quality of health care is much better now , and life expectancy is higher ( but that 's also because of general technological progress , and because better treatments/dugs from the west are available - during communism we were often stuck on old harmful drugs because of economic barriers - my parents had to import asthma drugs from canada for me via family because here only very strong steroids were available ) . 
   almost everyone had a home there were less homes than now , and similar amount of people . 
  more people lived in countryside and smaller cities , and now people migrated to big cities , so there 's still shortage . 
  but i grant you - lots of flats were built during communism . 
  their quality however was often abysmal ( especially in eighties ) . 
  and you had to wait sometimes for decade to get your flat . 
  young marriages lived with their parents very often ( they still often do ) . 
   equal pay for equal work everybody was paid equally shit amounts of pretend monopoly money  btw gender salary gap seems not to be corelated with `` post-communist '' vs `` capitalist '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:eu_27_gender_pay_gap.001.png if that 's your reason to envy the west - it does n't seem to make much sense to envy them . 
  about the only changes for the worse in poland are : religion education in schools ( it 's optional , but only in theory ) , and the homosexual laws . 
  but then again i do n't remember anybody famous coming out dring communism like peopld do now ( biedro\u0144 , raczek , grodzka ) - they would have faced worse discrimination than now most probably . 
  it was largely theorethical advantage . 
  it was n't union of lublin . 
  there were personal unions and attempts at real union before that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_krewo, 
  they blame foreigners allright . 
  germans , jews , foreign bankers , and ngos working `` for '' them . 
  for example batory foundation ( and soros that supposedly owns them ) are the biggest target ( because they complain about pis ) . 
  i guess now that usa is also complaining they will become enemy too . 
  russia fights 2 wars . 
  it annexed a peaceful neighbor territory . 
  how is it not `` the biggest threat '' ? 
  also 3 out of 58 is closer to 5 % than 10 %, 
  i meant ready food like frozen pizzas etc. 
  it 's actually very easy to cook sth that 's far better than shop food . 
  step 1 - do n't eat sweets nor shop food for a week . 
  this makes everything taste a lot better . 
  step 2 - slice a lot of random vegetables and some meat on a pan . 
  does n't really matter what exactly . 
  step 3 - eat the result . 
  it 's fun , and it takes like 30 minutes at most . 
  i 'm outsourced cheap polish software dev too . 
  what makes me wonder is - i 'm outsourced through 4 companies . 
  i wonder how much they earn `` in the west '' if it 's still more profitable to hire me and pay 4 intermediares . 
  ikarus buses/trams were everywhere in polish cities . 
  since forever . 
  only like 5 years ago they were retired . 
  polish hockey leagues is half-proffesional , though . 
  also the guy binding himself not to drown was tied to a public toilet , 
  this one doctor did nothing to help me . 
  clearly i must cut my leg off . 
  we go israel and russia route i see . 
   you ca n't criticize me , it means you 're a chauvinist !, 
   or is it that poland wants to raise taxes for certain business types ? 
  most of businesses which would be affected by this change are german and french . 
  http://www.dziennikwschodni.pl/lublin/n,1000175583,ten-podatek-zabije-polskie-sklepy-handlowcy-dzis-protestuja-w-lublinie.html http://gospodarka.dziennik.pl/news/artykuly/512358,rzad-pis-podatek-markety-sklepy-protest-solidarnosc-piotr-duda-handlowcy-lewiatan.html solidarity ( the trade union ) leader piotr duda says that despite the stated goal of imposing bigger taxes on foreign-owned shop networks - in practice the medium-size polish networks will bit he the hardest . 
  they scheduled protest this thursday . 
  on the other hand the networks you probably meant ( eurocach , biedronka ) shares prices increase since last month , when the details of the tax were announced : http://www.bankier.pl/inwestowanie/profile/quote.html?symbol=eurocash https://www.rcb.at/pl/produkt/stock/?id_notation=247691 i guess solidarno\u015b\u0107 and lewiatan clerks are germanized traitors , too ? 
  btw i 'm not against higher taxes in general , and for financial sector and malls in particular . 
  i 'm just against dumb , hastily written law introduced in the first reading in sejm and senat , with no consultations . 
  pis does everything this way . 
  no public consultations , no corrections voted , nothing . 
  also the nationalist propaganda makes me sick , but that 's mostlly cosmetic . 
  they are dumb . 
  simple as that . 
  if that was the case poland , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , etc - would have much higher rates than germany , france , uk . 
  i guess because it 's a country with very small population and lots of people going through all the time . 
  nobody said `` kotwica is a nationalist symbol '' . 
  you are arguing with yourself . 
  we said it 's used by nationalists , and it 's quite obvious , you have to be selectively blind not to see that . 
  btw if nationalist use it enough if will become nationalist symbol , just like swastika is now mainly symbol of nazism . 
  that 's how symbols take meaning , and the creators have no say in that matter . 
  it is used as one . 
  see the photo . 
  which is what the question was about in the first place - see the quoted part . 
   who use the kotwica as a nationalistic symbol i do n't know why you try to turn it into `` what is the definitive meaning of kotwica '' question . 
  my point is - the situation at the time was n't similar to modern day . 
  most nobles considered themselves commonwealth citizens before `` poles '' or `` lithuanians '' , and ethnicity was mostly irrelevant . 
  `` modern '' nationalism is xixth century invention . 
   who use the kotwica as a nationalistic symbol, 
   since when ? 
  http://p4.sfora.pl/ac3bce5451b57adc6837ea2cecabce4a.jpg it bogles my mind that people can be so stupid , but they apparently are . 
   what other ways are there for lithuanians to think that they are lithuanian ? 
  and pi\u0142sudski . 
  should be per million killed . 
  we use the same excuse . 
  but why interrupt post for that ? 
  the `` hidden '' meaning is - if you do n't train sth you wo n't be able to do it . 
  and yes , i am slightly afraid of russia . 
  it 's unstable , poor , authoritharian country with huge social inequalities , a lot of people and nuclear weapons . 
  when the next war in europe happens i estimate russia to be the most probable participant . 
  right . 
  defending is no different than nuclear attack . 
  this data is called index of economic freedom 2016 . 
  poland was 50th in 2014 edition , and 42nd in 2015 edition . 
  it 's slightly misleading the way they put it in the article ( why refer to 2014 data in one place , 2015 in the other , and not mention this data is labeled 2016 ? ) . 
  btw , the only way to check the rank for older years : http://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2014/book/index_2014.pdf http://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2015/book/index_2015.pdf http://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2016/book/index_2016.pdf, 
  the ranking in question : http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking btw on r/europe it would be better to post such news as `` here 's the new ranking of economic freedom '' , and link to the data , instead of particular country interpretation of it . 
  otherways people from countries not considered relevant in this article need to search for the ranking ( there 's not even a link there ) . 
  so , this weird sport turned out to be useful for something after all . 
  there was a time when declaring yourself atheist in most of christian countries would get you in troubles as well . 
  this changed , so why do you attribute the new tolerance to christian culture ? 
  btw fatalism ( determinism ) is part of many christian denominations . 
  technological progress is accelerating , in 200 years there will be singularity one way or other . 
  predicting stuff that will happen later is impossible . 
  my best guess - we will kill ourselves in some way . 
  engineered plague , grey goo , thermonuclear war , ai optimizing world for the paperclip production ( humans are inefficient paperclip producers ) .
