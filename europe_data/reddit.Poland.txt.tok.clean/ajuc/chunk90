  or introducing gun control in texas . 
  v4 countries other than poland were against russian sanctions . 
  orban is courting putin and they do common energy projects with russia . 
  suddenly it 's poland `` betrying '' v4 . 
  8000 russians in poland = nothing . 
  1000 muslims from syria in poland = end of independence and christian culture . 
  if po went insane and wanted to nationalize banks or do sth like that - anybody oculd sue them before constutitional tribunal , and it sufficed if judges there voted 51 % against . 
  if pis do sth insane ( and with their anti-eu and anti-bankers rhetorhic it 's more probable at least in perception of foreign investors ) - constutitional tribunal has to vote 67 % against it to cancel it . 
  that 's not going to happen , so in effect - constitution does n't mean anything in poland right now . 
  ultimately it 's about market trust , and pis is actively decreasing it . 
  we have 27 years of continuous economic growth . 
  government term is 4 years , but in that 27 years we had 17 governments  only 1 government was reelected , and most did n't even lasted 4 years . 
  at this point 2-4 % growth is assumed by voters , and they vote based on other things . 
  poland is less religious and less homogenous now than 20 years ago , yet we are 4 times more safe . 
  i really doubt it 's about religion and/or ethnicity . 
  until 2004 or so poland had higher crime rate than eu average . 
  then big emigration happened . 
  i wonder if these things are related . 
  source ( sorry for only some dates , but it does n't have data for each year for poland ) : http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/crime/violent-crime/intentional-homicide-rate#1991 1991\u00a01999\u00a02010 poland 2.8 4.83 1.1 germany 1.1 1.22 0.84, 
  sometimes it seems that everything wrong in polish history started with contrreformation . 
  if we were a little bit more practicaly about this , w\u0142adys\u0142aw 4th would be a russian tzar , and kozaks would be 3rd nation of commonwealth . 
  instead we got partitions ... 
  mongol 's composite bows were smaller , faster than longbows , and allowed better penetration/range for given draw weight ( because they were recurve so had more time to accelerate the arrow ) . 
  i wonder if 3 years from now pis supporters will still be using ad personam instead of actual arguments to defend the government . 
  right now the conversation seems like this : - po is stealing ofe money - you are a pis supporter , therefore shut up, 
  what i got from this article : - longbow archers are english hussars - an ok army unit made into a mythical invincible force because it 's a good story and fits the narrative the nation wants to spread about themselves - generalizing from 3 examples ( england , scotland , france ) is not a very good idea - it does n't matter who wins the war , if the story is good enough ( hint - france won that war ), 
  each and every polish city : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/bb/ab/c3/z12823483q,reklamowy-koszmar-w-centrum-warszawy--do-niedawna-.jpg i do n't mind commie blocks as much as i mind the junk ads everywhere . 
  it 's absurd . 
  exactly like duda in early 2015 , 
  it was n't like that in 2000 russia . 
  putin won 2000 elections with 53.4 % of votes . 
  duda had simmilar support last year ( 51.55 % in presidential elections ) . 
  nobody says poland now is like russia now . 
  people are concerned with the changes in the security systems ( tk , media law , judicary system ) - we are moving that way . 
  especially with all that abusrdly intense anti-eu propaganda . 
  which part ? 
  before it was a tourist destinatino for ukraine and russia . 
  now it 's a tourist destination for russia only . 
  clear improvement . 
  krak\u00f3w : 1791 -- 23 591 , 1910 -- 137 592 warszawa : 1792 -- 120 000 , 1914 -- 884 500 lw\u00f3w : 1772 - + -30,000 , 1910 - 206,100 wilno : around 20 000 in 1830 , i couldnt find better sources to compare , but it was slightly smaller than krak\u00f3w . 
  on the other hadn it had way better university . 
  in mickiewicz times wilno university were the best in the whole russian empire , and krak\u00f3w univeristy were nowhere close ( probably behind lw\u00f3w ) . 
  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/uniwersytet_wile%c5%84ski#cesarski_uniwersytet_wile.c5.84ski austrians were cool with autonomy , and that allowed for some historians to deal with matters they could n't in other partitions , but the city was provincial for the most part of xixth century . 
  krak\u00f3w was the poor and backward part of austrian partition , when warszawa and wilno were the most advanced parts of russian partition , and lw\u00f3w was well developed city ( admitedly - like krak\u00f3w it was placed in the poorest part of austrian empire , but it won the competition with krak\u00f3w at the time , it only started changing after ww1 , and changed suddenly after ww2 for obvious reasons ) . 
  i do n't mean to depreciate krak\u00f3w - it was very important polish city in many periods ( before waza , after ww2 ) , but during partitions it just was n't that important . 
  oh , nice to know . 
  where i came from ( lublin/w \u0142odawa region ) jagody and bor\u00f3wki are used for different kinds of blueberries . 
  also my granparents showed me another kind of wild berries - blue elongated ones ( greenish inside ) , also edible , and they called them '' \u0142ochinie '' . 
  gathering mushrooms , berries is n't tradition , it 's a hobby ? 
  also a way for people to earn some money in the summer . 
  not that obviously . 
  during partitions krak\u00f3w was a provincial city for most of the time , and wilno/lw \u00f3w / warszawa were the main cultural cities . 
  it should be splitted into `` southern lesser poland '' and `` eastern lesser poland '' . 
  eastern lesser poland has some influences from russian/ukrianian , but small . 
  it 's mostly small changes in pronounciation of some sounds . 
  i 've been told people from lublin pronounce words like `` lublin '' ( with bli sounds and similar ) softer than people from the rest of poland . 
  i do n't hear it , but then i 'm from this area  on the other hand people from krak\u00f3w region has this weird way of accenting first syllabe instead of second last syllabe like the rest of poland . 
  and their word for `` outside '' is `` to field '' instead of `` to court '' like in the rest of poland . 
  it 's all mixed and borders are not strict , the map is simplification . 
  anyway , polish dialects are much less different from each other than english dialects . 
  i do n't know of any pair that makes it impossible for speakers to understand each other , and trainspotting proved i do n't speak scottish english , 
  there are accents but they are nothing like in english . 
  i think mostly because our spelling system makes sense , 
  it 's also how i feel about contemporary poland : / we 're just in earlier stage . 
  oh , right , i 've learnt english by reading so in my pronounciation they are n't , 
  in poland : branding anything `` communist '' is a political suicide because it basicaly means `` soviet '' and is synonymous with `` corrupt '' / `` totalitarian '' / `` oppressive '' / `` dysfunctional '' . 
  socialist = `` slightly less intense communist '' . 
  it 's funny , because solidarno\u015b\u0107 was a socialist movement  . 
  in the beggining it was a joint movement by all people that wanted to change government , most of them wanted to stop the oppression , some wanted capitalism ( mostly meaning - make it so we are as rich as western europe , damn the short term consequences ) . 
  after 1989 there was huge propaganda campaign of right-wing economy ( and it was nessesary imho to do the painful reforms , but it caused 25 years of right-wing propaganda with almost no mentioning anything else ) . 
  young generations of poles see everything that 's even slightly socialist as `` leftist '' and automaticaly evil and dumb . 
  there are exceptions but rare . 
  also - lots of people have blind spot for public education and healthcare ( they do n't acknowledge it 's socialist , so they still can complain about leftists ) . 
  some ( mostly young ) people do notice and want to privatize both . 
  it was n't only for germans , it was used for all non-slavic people at first . 
  in many polish cities there are districts called `` niemce '' ( old polish for niemcy ) and these were usually places where foreigners were settled by kings/city administrators , and not nessesarily germans - also people from scotland , france , netherland , etc. 
  later it become a name for people using german language , and later when most of their states formed united germany - it become a name for that country . 
  i thought the same , but people explained to me that czech language used same spelling as polish at some point ( `` cz '' `` sz '' etc ) , only later they changed to all these c ^ s ^ . 
  if politicians from a country know there 's no chance to win they may change their vote in exchange for some favor . 
  so it 's not 100 % representative . 
  still interesting . 
  why ? 
  separate -- loading black powder guns from before 1885 and their replicas are legal to own and buy without gun permit , everything else is still controled . 
  how do you know that ? 
  do you live in germany ? 
  i 've been robbed once in poland ( long ago ) , and i have n't been in press . 
  right , i 've read parent comment more carefuly . 
  misinterperted your comment before . 
  if both women and men are more safe in country x than in country y , does it matter that women are much more safe than men in country x , when in country y both are equally unsafe ? 
  it 's like measuring average height , and deducing centimeters because genders have more different averages in one country , 
   people dont chain up their bikes in front of shops in most villages in europe . 
  and they do n't in poland ? 
  at least in my village . 
  anyway , i do n't know if it 's the 2nd safest country in the world , but from my experience it 's roughly as safe as any western european country i 've been in , safer than ukraine , and much safer than egypt . 
  old polish prover : `` where 's 2 poles there 's 3 opinions '', 
  you have to give it to kaczy\u0144ski - he read the needs of so far ignored parts of society well , and he manipulates them perfectly . 
  they are already shifting blame on germany , soros , kod protesters , communists . 
  i do n't see why would they stop out of sudden . 
   it is not that illogical to think `` something '' sentient and above these concepts wanted it . 
  no it 's not , it 's just not very helpful , because then you can ask `` who created that sentient sth '' .
