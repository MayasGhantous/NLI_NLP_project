  this threathens the eu solidarity . 
  russia can blackmail transit countries with shutting down the pipeline ( it happened already a few times ) . 
  normally this would be a costly move for russia because it also shut down the pipeline to western eu that keeps russia afloat , but now that it 's decoupled it 's less of a problem . 
  additionaly , this is the helping the current polish government narrative that `` germans are enemies , just like russia '' . 
  it 's harmful for the whole eu in the long term . 
  it 's not that big deal . 
  poland has some big farmers , but most are very small , and keep few big animals ( a few cows and pigs , and some hens at most , nothing that wolves would harm ) , they mostly grow plants . 
  i 'm originally from small village in eastern poland , and i 've never heard my grandpas or neighbors complain about wolves , if anything they complained about boars . 
  there 's also this whole symbolism around wolves = freedom , and that 's why i doubt government will go after the wolves . 
  this was one of the most popular protest songs during communism https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uizl4_sfp4 , and it 's about organized mass hunting of wolves ( a symbol for communists hunting oppositionists ) . 
  it 's sung byt the main singer associated with solidarity in 80s - jacek kaczmarski , and current government tries to persuade people they are solidarity continuators . 
  it would be shooting itself in the foot . 
  btw the song is based on w\u0142odzimierz wysocki 's \u041e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432 . 
  it was much closer , but it was n't equal , and the small differences mattered a lot . 
  best to use log scale to show these differences approprietely . 
  `` why the west rules ( for now ) '' is a great book that discusses this . 
  i especially like this graph ( not gdp , but shows the relative development pretty well ) . 
  rus is female noun , so it 's bela not belyi . 
  did n't knew about alternate etymology , but the color-direction connection was really used by early slavs , see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cardinal_direction#cardinal_directions_in_world_cultures there was also `` white croatia '' and `` white serbia '' ( somewhere in mdoern poland-germany ) . 
  bela rus = white rus ( ruthenia ) slavic people used colors for geographical directions . 
  white = north . 
  so , belarus = northern ruthenia ( because it was north of the original ruthenia ( kiev etc ) ) . 
   we have better relations with china than with western european countries . 
  lol . 
  badly , 
  the best thing about space ( no friction ) is - you only have to spend that energy once . 
  but it 's still interesting question . 
  i 've tried to calculate this . 
  assuming it 's a hollow cylinder ( ignoring the caps at both ends and the stuff inside , like people  ) : er = rotational kinetic energy = 1/2 i * w ^ 2 w = angular velocity i = moment of inertia for hollow cylinder = 1/2 m ( r1 ^ 2 + r2 ^ 2 ) m = mass r1 = inner radius r2 = outer radius m =d * pi * ( r2 ^ 2-r1 ^ 2 ) * l d = density l = length of the cylinder so : er = 0.25 * d * pi * ( r2 ^ 2 - r1 ^ 2 ) * l * ( r1 ^ 2 + r2 ^ 2 ) * w ^ 2 er = 0.25 * d * pi * ( r2 ^ 4 - r1 ^ 4 ) * l * w ^ 2 [ kg/m ^ 3 * m ^ 4 * m * 1 / s ^ 2 = kg * m ^ 2/s ^ 2 ] to get earth 's gravity you need rpm = 30 * sqrt ( r2/9 .81 ) / pi ( see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artificial_gravity#rotation ) i need this in angular velocity instead of rpm , and i 'm not sure about this `` 30 '' factor they use . 
  anyway , they determined for 2 rotations per minute would be liveable and would require inner radius of 224 meters , let 's use that . 
  so : w = 4 * pi r1 = 224 m r2 = 224.1 m ( let 's optimisticaly assume that mass-equivalent of 10 cm-thick steel wall would suffice ) for steel ( d = 7850 kg/m ^ 3 ) . 
  now we just need the length of the cylinder and we know the energy required . 
  let 's say 20 m. ~ ~ er = 0.25 * 7850 * ( 225.1 * 225.1 * 224.1 * 224.1-224 * 224 * 224 * 224 ) * 20 * ( 4 * pi ) ^ 2 = 1.6770831 e +14 ~ ~ er = 0.25 * 7850 * ( 224.1 * 224.1 * 224.1 * 224.1-224 * 224 * 224 * 224 ) * 20 * ( 4 * pi ) ^ 2 = 2.7883947 e +13 for the engine that was in lunar lander ( 14 kn ) it would take ~ ~ 0.25 * 7850 * ( 225.1 * 225.1 * 224.1 * 224.1-224 * 224 * 224 * 224 ) * 20 * ( 4 * pi ) ^ 2 / ( 14000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 356 ) = 389.46 years ~ ~ 0.25 * 7850 * ( 224.1 * 224.1 * 224.1 * 224.1-224 * 224 * 224 * 224 ) * 20 * ( 4 * pi ) ^ 2 / ( 14000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 356 ) = 64.75 years to make it spin fast enough . 
  but with the 7,770 kn engine that propeled the saturn v from the ground - it would be quite maneagable at just ~ ~ 0.25 * 7850 * ( 225.1 * 225.1 * 224.1 * 224.1-224 * 224 * 224 * 224 ) * 20 * ( 4 * pi ) ^ 2 / ( 7770000 * 60 * 60 * 24 ) = 249 days ~ ~ . 
  0.25 * 7850 * ( 224.1 * 224.1 * 224.1 * 224.1-224 * 224 * 224 * 224 ) * 20 * ( 4 * pi ) ^ 2 / ( 7770000 * 60 * 60 * 24 ) = 41.5 days assuming you can provide the ocean of liquid oxygen and hydrogen required  of course really you want 2 engines pointed the opposite direction , so it 's half the time . 
  the cylinder would offer 28 148 m ^ 2 for people , but the floor would be noticably curved . 
  also when you go upstairs you feel lighter , but the walls are closer to each other . 
  a nice thing is - every `` flat '' ( `` house '' ? ), 
  can have windows to space . 
  the space `` above '' the houses ( closer to the axis of rotation ) could be used for some plants that like microgravity . 
  btw if anybody could check the math it would be nice . 
  edit , so i was wrong , one thing was copy-paste error ( i 've fixed it ) , and another was i do n't know what , see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3z06d1/lunar_leap_europe_is_reaching_for_a_moon_base_by/cyiakam for the correct answer, 
  just like christmas , 
  we have przedwio\u015bnie for that . 
  tv criticizes government . 
  it 's funny how they claim they do it all to `` remove postcomunists '' , 
  it 's funny because in poland private schools are the worst . 
  because it 's cheap , available , and work . 
  almost all eu countries have economic growth . 
  russia has 4 % recession . 
  guns are dangerous . 
  people are stupid . 
  just like with cars , you ca n't have lots of people using them and no accidents . 
  also stats do n't support you assumption that in usa gun accidents are less common ( neither per citizen , nor per owned gun ) . 
  \u017co\u0142nierz ( soldier ) is from \u017co\u0142d = `` soldiers salary '' wojna comes from woj ( archaic for wojak/wojownik ) = fighter/warrior . 
  or the other way around , even wojew\u00f3dztwo ( district ) comes from `` woj\u00f3w wodzi\u0107 '' = `` leading warriors '' . 
  and there 's `` happy warrior '' = wojciech , 
  polish : - rozb\u00f3j = a robbery/a violent crime - rozb\u00f3jnik = a thug - b\u00f3j = archaic for fight/battle ( also sometimes struggle or competition , for example decathlon = dziesi\u0119ciob\u00f3j = 10-b\u00f3j ) so yes . 
  if you do n't mean `` panic '' then do n't write `` panic '' . 
  it 's simple really . 
   majority that suddenly becomes `` questionable '' if we would have listened people like op 's article author . 
  nobody questions elections ' results . 
  people question pis actions , because they workaround ( and sometimes break ) the law , and pis explanation , that they can do that because majority . 
  there 's no majority high enough to give you right to break law . 
  change constitution if you have enough votes , but do n't break it without changing it . 
   i meant on that 198x random data . 
   i was talking about that level of influence and you countered me with one now positioned guy and his acts from the eighties . 
  you were talking about these misterious connections and influences yet posted no proofs . 
  i 've posted one undeniable connection between pis and communists . 
  you complain i do n't have enough proofs , and also complain postcommunists in pis ranks are irrelevant to the subject of cleaning polish political scene from communists ( or just `` shaking '' them , whatever that means ) . 
   as they now have a legitimate power based on majority that 's the only real argument in your post otherwise full of ad personam attacks and changing subject . 
  congratulations on providing one . 
  i do n't agree with it . 
  imho pis achieving single majority is n't any better than po or psl achieving it when it comes to cleaning post-communist influences , because they have similar amount of connections to prevous system . 
  if you argue the opposite - you 're welcome to post proofs . 
  the random data shows that pis and its members were in power previously , and had `` shaken '' nothing . 
  why should this time be different ? 
  as for `` panic '' - this is funny argument . 
  you say i 'm wrong because i 'm acting on emotions , yet you have no way to prove my emotional state , and even if i did acted on emotions - this does n't mean i 'm wrong . 
  when someone in panic says 2 +2 = 4 is it wrong ? 
  when someone in panic says `` 2 +2 = 5 '' would you counter that by saying `` you 're in panic '' , or would you focus on the math ? 
  try arguing with arguments instead of accusations of particular emotional state . 
   i suppose objective observer should not lose hope that this could be a representation/outcome of the panic caused by something that could shake european non-ousted systems and structures inherited from communism j kaczy\u0144scy brothers were present in round table talks between communist government and opposition , that jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski now calls `` betrayal '' , and `` creation act of the system '' . 
  they were in various positions in many governments between 1989 and now , including 1992-1995 , 2000-2001 , 2005-2007 . 
  they were in aws together with what later became po . 
  some pis members were in pzpr , and some were working actively to supress opposition during martial law ( like pis mp stanis\u0142aw piotrowicz , which was persecutor during martial law in poland , wrote persecution documents for opposition activist , and later got medal from government in 1983 ) . 
  why people think pis are outsiders and will suddenly decomunize poland is beyond me . 
  for these people living in russia outside big cities the poverty is reality since 80s at least . 
  it 's `` christian '' identity . 
  very misguided at that ( europe is n't christian , and most christian churches support accepting refuges , including catholic church ) . 
  i 'd guess if you cut to the core it 's `` white power '' identity , as this `` glue-in '' shows : http://rostok.3-e.pl/blog_skanersa/2010-01-11-jestem-bialy.jpg `` thank you , mum , that i 'm white '' . 
   i like russia and the russian people . 
  i like how bad-ass they were in ww2 you mean the part where they were invading poland together with hitler , the part where they were invaded by hitler , or the part where they were invading poland to fight hitler ? 
  poor poles do n't want to wait another 25 years to have it as good as the western europe , so they believed pis is going to make it happen overnight . 
  also apparently the only reason we are n't already the richest country in the world is that every party except pis is full of communists , and russian or german spies . 
  jadwiga staniszkis is known supporter of po , 
  po introduced partialy unconstitutional law , which is n't in itself `` breaking the law '' , the constutitional tribunal is there to fix such cases and it happened many times for all governments . 
  it also happened for that particular law by po ( tk ruling from 3rd november ) . 
  pis broke the law by refusing to accept 3 legaly choosen judges ( as well as 2 judges choosen basing on that unconstutitional act ) . 
  if they wanted to follow law they would just accept the judges , and later choose 2 new judges after tk decision .
