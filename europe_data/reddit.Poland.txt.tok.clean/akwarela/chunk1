well , but now it is , it 's not a muslim , hindu , chinese etc tradition ... ^ ^ '' if we fallow your way of thinking we could say that renaissance was not made by the italians but by the ancient greeks and romans ... whole european culture is a mixture of different traditions ( roman , greek , celt , german , slav , christian ... ) the christianity had a strong impact on the european culture and i do n't get why some europeans are happy that christian traditions are now disappearing ... 
   while it 's great that christianity is declining why if the number of christians declines so much that they call off xmas ? 
  i would freak out in an empty flat ... 
  well , it 's really flag of milan , why should n't players of intermilan wear it ? 
  it 's rather offensive that someone forbids them to wear their symbols ... 
  yeah , sure , that ; s what they do :d, 
  [ google said it 's from here ] ( http://jesusgonzalezfonseca.blogspot.com/2011/09/como-es-el-mapa-genetico-de-europa-y-de.html ), 
  no , it 's a bullshit with that north-eastern poland . 
  after war almost everyone were forced to run away from their homes . 
  so i do n't get why the geography should match the ethnicity anywhere in europe , not speaking about poland ... 
  i ask because everyone around me are blonde ... 
  i got to ask it - how does the slavs look like ? 
  i would like to know how they do those kind of infographs . 
  i just wonder - if 50 % of population are women , they actually ask them `` are you natural blond ? 
  '' :d and there are also men who dye their hair . 
  personally i 'm cautious about infos like that in the internet . 
  lately i 've come across another map showing `` genetic background '' of the europeans . 
  [ if someone is interested ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nmmzzkz6w5a/tq-levrwkki/aaaaaaaadxi/nuob5ngjxfq/s1600/mapa-de-estructura-genetica-de-europa.png ), 
  so sweet :d thanks !, 
  well , i live in warsaw . 
  well , actually he was macedonian . 
  and macedonia was n't a small greek state , plus he could acquire that thanks to his father , so at least two generations worked for the success of alexander 's campaigns . 
  i personally think that more important than the military success was the fact that he changed europeans , and connected the west with the east of europe . 
  he also travelled with scientists that were translating , describing everything that get through their hands . 
  and for gods sake he was n't hitler or stalin :d his politics was to connect the hellenic culture with the culture of the defeated lands , not to destroy it . 
  [ tutoring ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0fvxf4sbae ) :d, 
  my favourite book written by finn would be sinuhe the egyptian by mika waltari . 
  great novel . 
  `` the saragossa manuscript '' by jan potocki , definitely my favourite . 
  i would say that it 's the european response for the arabian nights :d i could n't stop reading till the last page . 
  the movie directed by wojciech has is also worth watching , 
  happens  but actually i 've realised that we both may be right , cause bulgarian and russian both took a lot from the tatar and slavic language . 
  so i think that bulgarian may be in the middle between serbian and russian . 
  polish probably is farer than russian , but closer to serbian . 
  when you say that bulgarians speak well enough , do you realize that they were in touch with the latin alphabet since probably primary school ? 
  when someone is not familiar with greek alphabet , cyrillic etc and sees it first time in their life , is 20 and more years old it 's not that easy to use it . 
  as i mentioned it 's easy to learn letters , harder to read it . 
  i do n't speak bulgarian , i think that even i 've never heard bulgarian . 
  i could understand serbian or croatian and i 've never had a lesson of serbian or croatianas well and i ca n't understand russian . 
  i do n't know if a bulgarian can understand russian or polish . 
  you say that you can and i feel fine with that :d . i do n't know if it 's easy for a person that writes using cyrillic to learn latin alphabet . 
  it was difficult to me to use cyrillic while i was learning greek , learning other european languages that use latin alphabet was much easier . 
  that was my experience . 
  not true . 
  i know about at least two cases that the property was given back . 
  utter bullshit is saying that things like this do n't happen . 
  if you refer to the robbed art , i think that if in 60 years we got back a small % of what we lost it 's crazy to wait any longer , thinking `` maybe they will give us back the rest 90 % tomorrow '', 
  well , renovated buildings have more value , than a ruin . 
  if we talk about the usucapion - it 's always court 's decision and those cases could last years . 
  if you ask for my opinion i think that it should be regulated by an administration process , not by a court verdict . 
  in 2012 34 ppl took court action against the city , and it 's quite crazy , cause the city hall is even afraid to renovate those ruined buildings . 
  no matter what will be the court verdict a citizen looses . 
  well , it 's your point of view . 
  learning another alphabet may be useful , easy etc , but its really hard to read it . 
  i tried once to learn greek and i can read the letters , but reading the whole sentence makes me feel like if i was torturing the language . 
  i do n't believe that a serbian or croatian could understand russian that easily like they could understand polish . 
  i know it cause once being with my friends on holidays we could check it . 
  i could n't understand a word of what my russian friend was saying , but serbian was similar enough . 
  the same stated both my friends . 
  it 's not something i imagined ... ^ ^ '', 
  i think someone should sort out that reparation issue . 
  in the city i live it 's still quite a problem , and no one really cares that was not poland that started the war . 
  suddenly the grandgrandchild of the pre-war owner of the property shows up and claims it ( of course just after the building was renovated from the public money ) . 
  there should be something like an international law that says `` if someone does n't care for something for 60 years then it 's not his anymore '', 
  i could easily get through geboren/nato etc but russian version is always like # $ ** ## d ## d # . 
  + you need to remember that lots of documents were lost due to natural disaster , war etc. . . 
  i do n't want to discourage you , but that 's the reality , 
  well , 48 % of lituanians miss the ussr , the communism that they were forced to live in , but the voluntary polonisation during the commonwealth was depriving their national identity . . any lithuanian can explain it to me ? 
  polish uses the latin alphabet . 
  believe me , its a big advantage  and speaking polish you could understand other slavic languages ( except for russian , i do n't get a word ^ ^ ), 
  even if he uses declinations not correctly we will be able to understand him . . besides i always belived that a language is rather to communicate , not to do math , you do n't need to be that precise ... and the declinations he will learn them with time , reading , listening to ppl . 
  if you want to do genealogy research better learn russian , i got stucked with mine at 1887 cause everything on the east was written with cyrillic ( birth , matrimonial certificates ) , even those belonging to the church . 
  well , have you ever heard of [ esa ? 
  ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/european_cooperating_states ), 
  polish , a west slavic language ( together with czech and slovak ) , but actually 30 % of words comes from the greek or latin . 
  apart from latin 6 standard cases we added one more to our declination the `` insturmental '' ( which in latin covers ablativus perfectly , but well ... ) . 
  we have no definite or indefinite articles ( but we have 3 genders ) . 
  no subjunctive  we corrected a bit the latin alphabet adding \u017c , \u017a , \u0107 , \u0144 , \u00f3 , \u0142 , \u015b , \u0105 , \u0119 , but those sounds exist in other european languages , at least in french or italian ... they just write them differently . 
  why i like my language is that it 's more accurate than english , you can tell the same thing in many ways , adding one or tho letters to the same word , and then sligtly changing the meaning of the sentence . 
  for ex english ppl can only say `` wash '' but we can say , pra\u0107 , spra\u0107 , wypra\u0107 , przepra\u0107 etc. . . and there are nouns that are synonyms , but one comes from orginal language and the another from slavic : like education ( pl : edukacja = nauczanie ) ; organ ( pl : organ , narz\u0105d ) . 
  and actually its cool , cause it has helped me a lot learning foreign languages , 
  its like asking : what if cyprus annexed any continental territory would it still be an island ? 
  [ try this one ] ( http://www.piwaregionalne.pl/scale_media.php?type=beerbig&amp;dir=zdjecia&amp;file=ciechan-miodowe.jpg ) is my favourite , 
  nooo i did n't say it ... 
  i did n't say that `` all the europeans should stick to the europe '' if someone wants to feel like indiana jones , then fine , good luck !, 
  you say  limit ourselves simply to our own castles is na\u00efve . 
  what i wanted to say is that the example of that swiss family shows as that it is naive to think that in the rest of the world we can feel like in the europe . 
  well i 'm a girl and fair blond so i sticked out , no fun . 
  well the problem about us for a pole is that he/she needs to have a visa . 
  and even having a visa does n't mean that they wo n't turn one back on the airport in us . 
  i 've been to us , and as i mentioned before , everything depends on what you like , and i like more europe . 
  why ? 
  there 's a plenty of countries , cities in eu that i have n't seen . 
  my work does n't obligate me to travel at all ... 
  i love south of europe i could spend there every holiday in my live , i feel safe walking down the streets of cannes or rome ... all depends on what u like ... its not over-reaction , i just dont want to go anywhere where i have to dress in special way or be bothered or judged on the beach because i wear bikini ... 
  i rather pay more and have a nice calm holidays ... it seems rational to me ... 
  the same in egypt , i went there with my mum last year , and never again i wll cross the borders of eu ... 
  finally u got it !, 
  i 'm sorry ... but [ vikings should be blond !,
