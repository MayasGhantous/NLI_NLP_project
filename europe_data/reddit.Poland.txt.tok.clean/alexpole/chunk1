the best way to keep things going in poland is to adopt euro ( to our pockets working in west europe ) , at the same time keeping zloty ( on price tags in polish shops ) . 
  [ my s\u0142owianie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyix_3fbbpa ), 
  meanwhile in poland : [ ona ta\u0144czy dla mnie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxm7ma3q42w ) video is an internet parody . 
  i was dating british girl once , but then lost her phone number . 
  so she called me and said she hated me . 
  does that count as hate crime ? 
  i can not drink polish vodka . 
  can , t afford it . 
  who 's gon na win ? . 
  fifa !, 
  who 's already lost - the ordinary brazilians !, 
  real unemployment in poland is at least 15.3 % [ source ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/stopa_bezrobocia ) . 
  the trick , in short , is : if you have any income whatsoever , you are not counted as unemployed , if you do n't , and you live outside of bigger city , sooner or later you do not have money for a ticket to get to unemployment office and sign the papers . 
  then you stroke off the government statistics with no medical cover ( happy bunny ej ? ) . 
  government thinks , you went to london to work in the square mile . 
  case closed . 
  this also produces quite interesting correlation : unemployment going down =  suicide rates going through the roof . 
  netherlands , germany , france , even spain . 
  when poland can into space ( research ) ? 
  is that just a coincidence that poland considers mint-sauce export embargo for uk ? 
  from time to time old mother europa has this problem of unwanted children . 
  it 's usually been solved by wars , plagues , crusades , emigrating to colonies etc. 
  and followed by periods of social changes and prosperity . 
  something tells me it 's going to be same shit on different day . 
  in poland we have similar problem with storks being killed in lebanon while migrating . 
  together with germany we 're trying nicely ask lebanese to stop shooting them for [ fun ] ( http://www.dailystar.com.lb/news/lebanon-news/2014/mar-21/250904-local-stork-hunting-sparks-outrage-abroad.ashx#axzz30aktnvt3 ) . 
  edit : si vis pacem , para bellum , so im working on stork-like dron , which will follow migrating birds and return fire if challenged , 
  all in all , this may be quite unique situation in whole europe . 
  imagine czechs , slovaks and poles meeting at a party - before they get to know each other , they would be smiling and laughing their asses off . 
  then comes best vodka and beer on the top of that - what a bash . 
  also gipsis are called roma ( polish : romowie ) easy to mix up with romanian ( polish : rumun ) . 
  same in polish . 
  feminine is rumunka . 
  i 'm sure you can have both at the same time in romanian countryside . 
  czech makes me laugh my tits off ( elektronicky mordulec = terminator :d ) italian sounds nice , ` coz it 's close to latin . 
  hungarian though must be from another galaxy far , far away , still worth learning , cos magiars are nice people . 
  eu without european energy union seems like marriage without sex . 
  how about : 1 . 
  russian bear 2 . 
  deutscher michel 3 . 
  john bull 5 . 
   i would like to ask you how do parties in your country advertise the upcomming voting ? 
  imho very poorly . 
  what a bunch of tossers , trying to justify they own existence , while they only care about milking the cow for few more years . 
  i will be astonished to see turnout of more than 20 % in poland . 
  is fifty-fifty politically correct ? 
  [ \u015bmigus dyngus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9amigus-dyngus ) apart from getting intoxicated, 
  one of my favourites : apollo and sojuz are orbiting above soviet union . 
  american says to russian : you have very sophisticated society , look , everybody is watching us with little telescopes . 
  russian looks through the window and answers : no , they are drinking vodka straight from the bottles !, 
  * what 's the difference between republic and people 's republic ? 
  * same as between chair and electric chair . 
  lenin is dying in his bed and stalin pays him last visit . 
  - soviet people must follow you - says dying lenin - if they do n't follow me , they 'll follow you - answers stalin . 
  well , it 's time to introduce `` hug a hungarian '' day !, 
  handing the check over to corrupt administration would not be the best idea , but doing it step by step could prove beneficial for both eu and ukraine . 
  starting form easy local border traffic , and student exchange through trade agreements and european investments , ending with eventual eu accession . 
  that would cost at most half of greek bailout over a period of time . 
  yeah , go ahead with monument demolition toolbox training !, 
  r u serious dude ? 
  wan na buy second-hand lenin monument ? 
  moscow propaganda junkies kicking the bucket ? 
  beer in turkey and albania ??? 
  at least everybody else loves you , 
  oh , please , do n't !, 
  yeach , poland is a a shithouse , and we fuck up a cup of coffiee . 
  please , do not fap-fap to my post - nienada !!, 
  really , this just opened my eyes . 
  what a briliant analisis of reality . 
  ha ha ha , say hallo from me to central committee and politbiuro .

  thank you [ lonely swordman ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%be%d1%82 ) of the great cause !, 
  larry flynt said that , and it perfectly sums up your comment , 
  poles do not hate russians !, 
  we hate their kgb infested , propaganda spreading political class . 
  if i do n't like mafia , does it mean i do n't like italians ? 
  i third that, 
   fourth largest economy , fourth biggest population , fourth most powerful military and , possibly more importantly , the fourth largest contributor to the eu ... and surely top spot in bunga bunga industry ,

  you can say both and be understood in pl . 
  we prefer horse wagons anyway . 
  north pole , i guess . 
  the sweeds are close with them . 
  reminds me pppp in poland . 
  just driving back from italy . 
  roads ( ss and sp ) mostly look like moon landscape or sarajevo after shelling . 
  sorry belgium , you are number two in this contest .
