you do pay for it , in taxes . 
   rape every hungarian woman last red army did that and look how birth rate grew right after the war . 
   trespassers illegall migrants , since they illegally went through border . 
  luckily you now how to remove kebab and destroy `` invinsible '' planes . 
   generous welcome they received when they rejoined the ranks of western liberal democracies best joke ever , `` generous welcome '' by countries who attacked us , betrayed us three times during one war and sold us , victims , to soviets . 
  it 's not like they owe us or something ... 
  different times , for us honor was still a value , you ca n't say that ` bout germans and soviets . 
  i 'm not saying that you ( as citizens ) are not , but what 's your government is doing is just sad and might be dangerous for swedes . 
  you know , we 've got experience with `` unstable '' neighbours , and it 's quite close distance between polska and sverige , got to learn on our mistakes . 
  you 'll benefit when we 'll be saving swedes in next 20 years if your immigration policy wo n't change . 
  actually you have it wrong , first `` i want poland to be powerful again '' , but after all it 's easier to handle destroyed russia and destroyed germany . 
  yeah ... actually many nkvd oficers were jewish-origin soviets and we have no reasons to love nkvd . 
  who might think they 'll be beaten in france ... 
   unlike countries in western europe , which have long histories of accepting immigrants from diverse cultures , the former communist states tend to be highly homogeneous . 
  poland , for instance , is 98 percent white and 94 percent catholic . 
  oh they have to be fucking kidding me . 
  we `` tend to be higly homogeneous '' becouse west sloughtered our minorities 70 years ago and now we just do n't want problems with minorities like west have . 
   western europe , which have long histories of accepting immigrants for ages jews were fleeing from western europe to poland no the other way . 
  polish fisherman catches magic fish , fish says `` just free me and i 'll grant you three wishes '' . 
  pole thinks and thinks and thinks `` i want poland to be powerful again '' , ok - says fish , you 've got it . 
  fisherman needed a while to figure out his second wish ; `` fish , i know what i want ! '', 
  `` what is it ? '', 
  - fish ask . 
  `` i want chinese to invade poland . '', 
  `` are you sure ? 
  they 'll destroy your country '' `` yeah , i 'm sure , they 'll have to go through russia , twice '' `` weird , but ok , they 'll invade poland . 
  what now ? '', 
  `` are chinese back in china ? '', 
  `` yes '' `` now they can invade germany '' `` through russia ? '', 
  `` through russia  '', 
  damn dude , it 's so funny lithuania - northern europe , but czech republic-eastern ? 
  poland - eastern europe ? 
  please tell me why everybody always forgot ` bout central europe as a region ? 
  we are very open minded when it comes to western-european/scandinavian ` migrants , 
  we are not oposing joining euro , but in contract we signed there was no date , no specific data , just `` oo , you 'll have to join euro '' and we will , in 2222 , maybe in 2221 , who knows , 
  cool . 
  dude , it 's not 80 's . 
  there are 2 separate countries , czech republic and slovakia , as well as 2 separate nations . 
  i 'm just curious , is there any chance for ireland to unite with northern ireland ? 
   they and their children could work incredibly long hours in terrible , and incredibly dangerous , conditions just to barely feed themselves . 
  guess what ? 
  that 's how lower class lives looked like for pretty much all human history , thanks to capitalism money were transfered to lower class and finally after 3-4 generations , ` couse it 's a process , not something that just happens , lower class was finally able to provide their kids proper education and healthcare . 
   but anyway it is quite natural for us to be upset when other nations do not agree with us . 
  i completely get that , especially that france is really powerful ( economically , diplomatically and militarly ) country and when some not so powerful country says `` no ! '', 
  it can be a little bit difficult to get along . 
   sorry for the mistakes in polish ( ... ) i am better in spoken polish do n't worry , polish grammar is really difficult , but have some tip : we do n't use `` v '' in polish . 
  it 's just `` w '' everywhere . 
  how did you learned polish also why ? 
  the big problem of eu as one political organism is that different countries have different goals , different foreign policies and you ca n't make everyone happy . 
  our farmers get 1/8 of what yours get . 
  we have nothing to say when france and germany want to establish something . 
  when will you realise that `` unified and integrated europe '' means for pretty much everyone `` do what france and germany says '' . 
  for example we need to protect our country as eastern flank of nato and eu . 
  we want nato military bases in poland . 
  our energy sector is based on coal , we have world 10th coal resources , yeah it 's not green , but guess what ? 
  we ca n't afford anything else , ` couse of long communist period ` couse germans destroyed our country and so called `` allies '' sold us to soviets , so we really need coal power . 
  then comes germany , says fuck you , that 's not gon na happened and we 're screwed . 
  again . 
  and now , after as we all know , multi-kulti policy failed , germany is welcoming more and more illegals and when it comes out of control they 're trying to force others to make mistake that france and germany made ~ 30 years ago . 
  so why should polish foreign policy look like , pardon , `` ok , i 'll suck your dick , then you will fuck me and after all you 'll say ; oh you 're so european dear poland , we like you a little bit '' . 
  we are tired of this . 
  that 's why a lot of countries , especially `` new-union '' countries are finally standing up for themselves . 
  eu always was team game for 2 teams , germany-france vs everyone else . 
  that 's pretty much how it looks like from ** central ** europe . 
  edit : one more thing about `` we do n't want to share the burdens '' - said france when we started emborgoing russia . 
  do n't be hypocrite . 
  there was no `` good '' solution , both were bad , but at the time society chose to make and exception , there 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
  carry on , 
  an the one hand traitors 've got what they deserve on the other making exceptions when it comes to law is never good : /, 
  i would n't generalise like that , but upa-oun sentiment is growing in ukraine and that 's quite terrifying , especially that ukrainian minority in poland is growing as well and most of them are ukrainians from western ukraine , basically upa bastion . 
   you are very much invited to add to the solution what you 're trying to solve is not problem , but problems effect . 
   saying `` not my border , not my problem '' is unacceptable . 
  you already told that , but again , you 're not using arguments . 
  `` that 's bad , that 's unacceptable '' . 
  these are not arguments , i mean , they 're but for a child . 
  why do you believe it 's `` unacceptable '' ? 
  do i really have to teach you what argumentation is ? 
   first contact in eu takes the refugees as far as i remember your country signed dublinii as well as mine , obey the law , ordnung must be !, 
   what now ? 
  share the refugees ? 
  sink them ? 
  expell them ? 
  any polish ship in the med-sea ? 
  actually our navy need some training , and i do n't mean shooting to them , they 're people , even if they 're criminals ( by getting/tryin ' here illegally ) i mean simply turning them back as `` here some water , go back , you do n't want us to use force '' . 
  becouse saying , `` yea , come here , we 've got zie space and money for you '' and after all forcing others to take migrants wo n't stop the flood , it 'll just the signal to other migrants that it 's ok to came to europe becouse even european leaders seid it 's ok . 
  you know , there are rules for subsidies , and we 're also contributing to eu budget , in next years subsidies for us wo n't be as big as they 're now , but we 'll have to pay as much `` eu tax '' as we 're paying now . 
   your southern border is 100km north of lybia in lampedusa ... as far as i remember poland is central european country , 100kms south from us are czech republic , slovakia , and at certain point , in straight line at 100ish kms hungary . 
   part of the eu eu policies aim to ( ... ) maintain common policies on trade , [ 19 ] agriculture , [ 20 ] fisheries , and regional development . 
  [ 21 ] nothing ` bout non eu migrants in the eu we voted to join . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union )  part of schengen `` the schengen area is the area comprising 26 european countries that have abolished passport and any other type of border control at their common borders , also referred to as internal borders . '', 
  wow , still nothing about common policies ` bout illegals , it 's just to help free movement of ** europeans ** in ** schengen area ** . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area )  european country that simply means we are located in europe , nothing else . 
  so please educate yourself when it comes to geography , espacially that we 're neighbours , and try to use arguments not just empty phrases . 
  at the beginning i 'd like to add that for us , poles , glorifying upa and oun is something like glorifying ss for jews , no one ( except for neo-nazis ) glorify ss ` couse as we all know that was evil organisation . 
  yet there are people in nowadays ukraine who glorify upa , oun and bandera . 
  it just hurts that someone is glorifying bandits and murderers . 
   controversial stepan bandera he was civilian murderer , does n't matter if he was killing jews , poles , russians , he ordered brutall ethnic cleansing in polish galicia-volhynia region . 
  nothing controversial , just criminal . 
   upa fought against polish ukrainian fight against polish - mass murdering civilians , bravo , such enemy . 
   home army ( ak ) killing 20,000 ukrainians .
