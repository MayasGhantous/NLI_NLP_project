  i 'll ask mods to change it . 
  thanks for notice . 
   i hope all saints day will stay here for another generation or two before it 's inevitably replaced will they be replaced ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  halloween will be way more popular than it is now , that 's for sure . 
  however for many families , including mine , all saints day , especially when long weekend happens is a great opportunity for family reunion at grandma 's . 
  it depends , most cemeteries in poland looks like this . 
  this particular one is from little town where i grew up , sorry for police pics , but those where easy to find [ 1 ] ( http://www.krosno.lubuska.policja.gov.pl/dokumenty/zalaczniki/158/158-2023.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.krosno.lubuska.policja.gov.pl/dokumenty/zalaczniki/158/158-2024.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.krosno.lubuska.policja.gov.pl/dokumenty/zalaczniki/158/158-2022.jpg ) i guess it 's quite difficult to get those `` american '' looking cementeries considering that cremation is highly unpopular here . 
  it 's not only mixed christian-pagan holiday , it 's quite important day in our culture , candles are the way to show remembrence of your passsed away relatives . 
  becouse of importance of this holiday , 1st november is free of work holiday so every one can visit their passed away relatives . 
  big traffic jams and some traffic related-accidents are unfortunate every year addition . 
  it 's raining ( or more like trying to rain ) here too . 
  11.5 % of renewable energy ? 
  i 'd say not that bad . 
   pedophilia actually pedophillia is attraction to prepubescent children/early teen . 
  having sex with people whos age is below the consent age in a country is illegal and it might be pedophillia , but not always is . 
  imagine you are guy in he 's ~ 30s on vacation in malta . 
  you went to a bar , came back to hotel room with young girl , had sex . 
  in the morning you realise she 's 17 not 19-20 as you thought she is . 
  are you a pedophile ? 
  no , you are not , you commited a crime under maltese law by having sex with a minor whos age is under local age of consent , but that 's it , it does n't make you a podephile . 
   also some people embrace it as a big middle finger to russia . 
  `` russians are butthurt so it must be a right thing to do '' unfortunately that 's also a middle finger for your biggest supporter in eu . 
   `` russians are butthurt so it must be a right thing to do '' was a popular justification for having a street named after stepan bandera in kiev it 's sad that no one considered that your supporters might be `` butthurt '' too . 
   at the same time such people ignore that the middle finger is shown not only to russia , but to poland as well . 
  such short-sight , or ignorance can and probably will backfire . 
   i hope that since the support of actual right-wing nationalists are quite low it 's just a passing phase and we will grow out it . 
  so do we . 
   i doubt polish are so stupid that they are ready to ruin relationship with ukraine because of this and let it go under russian influence creating a potential enemy right at your borders dude , imagine germans glorifying nazis saying `` i doubt poles/jews are so stupid that they are ready to ruin relationship with germany because of this '' . 
  your government just went full retard with glorifying people that commited genocide . 
   creating a potential enemy right at your borders - it will not make any better neither for poland nor ukraine . 
  our exports to ukraine make just [ 1,7 % of our whole exports ( 2014 data ) ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/pol/#destinations ) , i guess we can live without it . 
  ukraine is extremely poor country ( for european standarts ) with messed up economy and very weak army . 
  of course we do n't need more enemies , but that kind of enemy is no danger to us . 
   i think this is intentionally being over discussed and brought at light by those who try to ruin polish-ukrainian relationship ( read - moscow ) . 
  here we go again , those bloody ruskies/s i mean of course that 's being used , but it would n't be used if that did n't happened in first place . 
   poles need to understand that ukrainians do n't praise upa soldiers for the massacre ( wast majority regret it and is ashamed of it ) - they do it coz those fought for ukrainian independence let me use similar comparison as i used before . 
  imagine praising nazis in germany and germans telling jews and poles `` oh , you get that all wrong sillies , we do n't praise them ` couse they wanted to erase you from our new living space , we praise them ` couse they made our economy so good in '30s '' . 
  it does n't matter if you praise people like this ` couse of their fight for independence or mass murdering , they 're bad , praising bad people is wrong , period . 
   it is in both countries interests considering recent russian aggressive stance towards neighbors . 
  in both countries interest is having healthy relationship and that ca n't happened when one country says `` i apologize for what they did '' and literally few hours later calls guys it apologized for `` national heroes '' . 
  they have more resources than us , ports on black sea coast , not baltic coast like we do , more people and very arable lands . 
  25 years ago they were slightly richer than us . 
  they just completely fucked up economy reforms , even belarus , with their weird economy are doing way better than them . 
   their country has become chess board between america and russia yep , but that started happening like 4-5 years ago , they are the ones who completely messed up their economy , not russia , not eu , not usa . 
   almost everyone in eastern europe had a tradition of killing jews at the slightest opportunity you ca n't be serious . 
  stopped reading here mate . 
  second biggest population in the world and first in europe , then germans came . 
  my english is n't so good . 
   how do you measure that ? 
  in saved people . 
   poland also had the highest number of jewish people . 
  yep . 
  that change nothing , we did n't murder them , we were saving them . 
  there are black sheeps in every herd , yet in poland those black sheeps were punished . 
  that 's not so difficult , as long as ukrainians actually speak ukrainian not sur\u017cyk or russian and both sides use simple words it 's possible to have long conversations . 
  source : worked with ukrainians , ca n't say anything in their language yet we had long conversations on various topics . 
  though i 'd like to hear silisian-ukrainian conversation . 
   why is the polish govt getting so triggered by this mostly ` couse we are tired of `` polish death camps '' , `` poles were killing jews '' , `` poles were helping nazis '' etc. 
   some individuals this . 
  those individuals were punished by polish underground state , punishment was death , no exceptions . 
  there was no mass collaboration like in austria or norway , or collaboration state like vichy-france . 
  poles saved the biggest amount of jews during wwii though poland was only country were helping jews was punished by death . 
  `` nazi occupation of warsaw 70,000 -- 90,000 polish gentiles aided jews , while 3,000 -- 4,000 were szmalcowniks '' [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii#poland ) that 's for warsaw alone , city with 1/3 jewish population . 
  i would n't say that 's a lot of szmalcowniks ( guys who were helping germans to get rid of jews ) . 
   who were ignorant and a product of their time funny thing , polish nationalists , many of them hardcore anti semites during interwar period , product of their time , were actively helping and rescuing jews during wwii . 
  szmalcowniks on the other hand were doing that just for money , that was n't ideological , just money . 
  without mentioning all that things we suffered , how we were punished for helping jews and fighting , how we were fighting against germans , mentioning only bad things , done by less than 1 % of poles during wwii is unfair and shows us as really bad guys , `` literally nazis '' , which really pisses of many poles , especially that we were victims during that war not perpetretors of wwii . 
  chance that when your country , austria and croatia would n't like something that for e.g. 
  germany or france is trying to push you could block it , or push stronger your own ideas . 
  stuff like v4-nord stream 2 shitstorm , v4 against refugees quota etc. 
  for small countries like slovenia , croatia , austria or czechia , slovakia , hungary and poland ( we are `` just '' 8th economy of eu , 7th if brexit happens ) it 's important to unite if we want to push for laws etc. 
  that will satisfy us . 
  pretty much every communist party, 
  nah , age of consent was the same for gay and straight people , so i guess it was more like : `` we do n't care '' that `` we do n't know '' . 
  also that tank is piece of soviet technology and soviet stuff will either broke very fast or work 'till end of the world . 
  yep , that would be so bad to let people decide in democracy . 
  looks like you have a lot of learn . 
   hubertus for foreigners : hubertus festivals are all around the country , st. hubertus is patron of forests , hunters and ( horse ) riders , so there are masses in churches/forest chapels , hubertus horse riding competitions ( catch the `` fox '' , one rider have fox tail pinned to his/her left arm , to one who 'll rip off fox tail becomes `` fox '' in next year competition ) , hubertus hunts . 
  damn , do we really have that kind of wooden architecture ? 
  my first thought was that it 's somewhere in belarus/lithuania . 
  ( hint : never been in eastern poland ), 
   1863x . com pretty cool name for website , is january uprising a real thing in belarus ? 
   remember when it was ok to commit gay people to asylums and castrate them ? 
  that was in the 50s in europe & the us , a little after women were given the right to vote . 
  you mean in `` western europe '' , right ? 
  ` couse while really bad shit was happening in great , progressive countries like uk/s [ e.g. 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alan_turing ) in those bad , backwards ones like mine only laws that applied only to lgb ( no `` t '' back then ) people were age of consent for gay sex ( 15 , same for straight people ) and ban for gay prostitution ( lifted in ' 69 ) . 
  i 'm simply getting tired of `` meh europe so bad , collonialism , no woman rights , persecutions of gay people etc. '', 
  ` couse that happened in western europe , not central europe . 
   their reasoning is that isis is n't ethnic based hate like nazis are . 
  oh , then it 's fine to support people who 'd like to kill jews as long as they want to kill jews ` couse of their religion , not ethnicity ? 
  so holocoust of poles would be fine as long as poles would be murdered ` couse of their religion , not ethnicity like ~ 70 years ago ? 
  i 'd say that closest to `` unbiased '' news sources would be state owned [ polish press agency ] ( http://www.pap.pl/en/ ) and [ the news ] ( http://www.thenews.pl ) - news website owned by polish radio ( also state owned ) . 
   cathojihadists cathotalibans , cathotalibans mate . 
  colonialism as part of lithuanian history ? 
  in which part of your history ? 
  our dependent state ( duchy of courland ) literally had two colonies . 
  one little town in trinidad which dutch stole and one little fort on river island in africa which was taken by brits after quite long besieging . 
  that 's it mate .
