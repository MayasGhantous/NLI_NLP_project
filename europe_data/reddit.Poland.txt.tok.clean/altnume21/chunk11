  just one town/camp and one fort , without slaves * , that were n't even ours , they were property of jacob kettler , duke of courland and semigallia , not property of king of poland and grand duke of lithuania * funny thing , but natives , wether in tobago or in africa were treated as subjects of courland not slaves , duke jacob kettler was trading with them , not abusing them , that 's why they allowed his people to settle on their land . 
  abortion is not illegal in poland , it 's just not fully legal , as our law says : abortion is legal when the woman 's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy , when the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act , or when the fetus is seriously malformed . 
  though there 's no punishment for any kind of abortion . 
  so called `` legal compromise '' which we had for all those years actually was n't so bad , left sometimes talked about `` we need more liberal abortion rights '' , right was like `` fuck no '' , though abortion pills are available , when women are going to abortion clinics in germany/czech republic/slovakia right is looking the other way and they can sleep at night . 
  i can guarantee that if any party will try to push for more liberal abortion law we will have at least as big `` pro-life '' protests as we now have all those `` black '' protests . 
   yeah , we have a similar thing in poland where if you are buying something like 5 pln worth of goods , you can not pay by card . 
   also , a lot of places will not allow you to pay just for cigarettes by card so you have to get something else if you want a pack of smokes . 
  funny thing - that 's illegal under polish law , frankly speaking i have n't saw those `` card payments over 10zl '' signs for years . 
  i live in western poland if that matters . 
  i almost always pay by card wheter i 'm buying chewing gum ( 2zl-0 .5 e ) or doing big groceries . 
  sometimes it 's difficult , when for e.g. 
  some fellas brutally slaughtered their neighbours , people that litterally lived next door/village ` couse of their ethnicity and now those guys are called national heroes like in balkans or ukraine . 
  for me it 's difficult to just let it go , when i hear that soviets `` liberated '' poland , while my family was exiled by them from poland to siberia just for being poles ( they lived in what 's now northern belarus ) , or to let go , when i hear that leaders of ukrainan insurgent army are now national heroes of ukraine , guys who planned and committed brutal ethnic cleansing of ~ 80 thousands non ukrainans in galicia-volhynia , while other part of my family that is from what 's now western ukraine barely escaped that slaughter . 
  however i can let go germans , they 've done terrible things during the war , some of my family members died during `` hearings '' , but guess what ? 
  ss guys are n't consider national heroes in germany , no one is naming street after nazis , it 's literally impossible to find hitlerstrasse or himmlerstrasse in modern germany while in ukraine they 're naming streets after people like them . 
  good luck in finding nazi germany flags on german streets , while in western ukraine it 's no problem to find upa flags . 
  most important germans actually apologised and made sure that wo n't happen again , i know it sounds like a cliche , but after all those years that 's what really matters . 
  and you are lynching negroes . 
  i guess it 's the matter what generation is ruling , nowadays , rules 68 's leftist/socialist/communist generation , back in the days they were `` revolutionaries '' , know they 're what they 're . 
  the question is how long these guys will be in power , next 10-15yrs top ? 
  then we will be able to observe next generation , more conservative , more right-wing , dominating politic views in thru generations looks like sinusoide , generations after us will asked themselves the same question you asked . 
  in poland you can buy it at any time in any shop with license for selling alcohol , so pretty much in every convenience store , supermarket , gas station etc. 
  and of course there 's no problem with buying alcohol in bars/pubs/clubs at any time as long as their open . 
  there are a lot of convenience stores called \u017babka ( froggy ) which are open 6-23 everyday , gas stations are open 24/7 , there few supermarkets opened 24/7 and often liquor stores are opened 'till 12-1 am on friday and saturday so buying alcohol during a party is not a problem . 
  are they ? 
  i mean in germany , country sorrounded by countries whith no war and stable economy and guess what , almost all of those countries are sorrounded by countries with stable economy and no war ( 2 exceptions poland-ukraine ; slovakia-ukraine ) , considering that majority of them are from mena states they are economic migrants . 
  i agree with you on one thing though , most of them are no immigrant labor , just benefits `` hunters '' . 
  i think you 're missing a point here . 
  they maybe were polish-speaking lithuanians ( as of baltic ethnicity ) in xviiith century but as you can see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_the_vilnius_region#1916_german_census ) they considered themselves polish . 
  it was n't about language but about identity , there were a lot of people who identified themselves as poles and had very poor knowledge of polish/poorer than language of majority where they lived , for example my great grandparents . 
  two of them were from eastern parts of wilno voivodeship and they ( as well as their parents ) used belarussian basically everyday since they were born 'till end of the wwii , it was way easier for them to communicate in belarussian than in polish in their adult life but still they considered themselves polish and were considered polish , very similar story with my great grandparents from what 's nowadays western ukraine , they used mixed ukrainian-polish ( well mostly ukrainian ) but still considered themselves polish . 
  there were as well people who spoke better polish than belarussian/ukrainian/lithuanian / yiddish/german but did n't considered themselves polish . 
  during interwar period being polish , not just citizen of poland , was about your identity , if you believed that you 're part of a polish nation you were if not , you were n't . 
  i believe you 're uneducated or very provocative ` couse you stated that poland , germany and ussr had ** same ** motives and actions , that 's simply false and false statements are called accident if done unintentional or lies if done intentionally . 
  do you seriously not see any difference between [ this , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_of_world_war_ii ) [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) and [ little polish green man alpha version ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbeligowski%27s_mutiny ) ? 
   danzig had german majority too , but you refused to give it to hitler and we know what then happened ... hope that was sarcasm mate , ` couse victim blaming is not ok . danzig as a state was established as league of nations protectorate which supposed to be compromise between polish and germans . 
   so attack on poland is completely justified , according to you ? 
  ca n't see the difference between those two ? 
  polish annexation of wilno region was officially and de facto ` couse of polish majority and cultural ties of a region to poland ( as heir of plc ) . 
  ussr attack was officially ` couse eastern slavs minorities , de facto ` couse stalin knew that war with germans will come and he would n't like to make germany way stronger than it already was . 
  seriously though , if that was n't a provocation what do they teach you at school ? 
   ussr thought it was right to invade poland too . 
  does n't make it less shameful though . 
  we did n't persecuted lithuanians in wilno voivodeship as ussr persecuted locals , we did n't murdered them ( as a state , i guess single murder pole on lithuanian could happened ) or send them to labor camps for being lithuanians . 
   btw , jews were the biggest in the city . 
  who happened to prefer lithuanian rule and boycotted the polish occupation at first . 
  most `` poles '' were ethnic lithuanians who were speaking polish . 
  source pls . 
  if someone says he/she is polish , have polish ( or as you may prefer `` polish '' ) parents , speak polish , consider himself/herself polish and is recognized internationally and by local government as pole i believe we can speak of him/her as of polish . 
  guess what ? 
  those as you wrote `` ethnic lithuanians who were speaking polish '' , considered themselves polish ( censuses in wilno region - [ here you have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_the_vilnius_region#russian_census_of_1897 ) ) . 
  there were ( still are ) poles with lithuanian surnames [ such as defender of wizna - w\u0142adys\u0142aw raginis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_wizna )  if poland felt so strong in vilnius , they would n't have banned lithuanian schools and cultural organisations ... those were banned ` couse our government wanted to polonized as much people as possible in eastern poland , that was n't ok , especially after 123 of germanization and russification of polish people . 
   teschen are you aware that our part of cieszyn was taken from us by czechs in 1920 when we were busy fighting commies . 
   invaluable importance city that was part of poland for thousands of years of our state ; poland is heir of plc not only polish crown , but of whole state . 
   how can poland even endure without such important cities as wilno or lviv and without polish country of belarus ? 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  we accept post wwii borders , though in this discussion we 're talking ` bout pre-war period . 
   funnily , the same `` center of x culture and science '' meme is thought in lithuania and belarus too . 
  that 's cool , but in interwar period that was ( let 's put aside that center of culture and science ) ethnically [ polish city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_the_vilnius_region#1916_german_census ) , the second biggest minority were jews , after them were lithuanians with 2,6 % ( 0,9 % in 1931 ) . 
  well , lithuanian population in wilno was 1 % of a whole city ( poles - 65,9 % ) , while in wilno voivodeship lithuanians were 5,2 % of general population ( poles - 59,7 % ) . 
  polish society wanted to live in their fatherland ( wilno voivodeship ) in poland , so we made it possible . 
  i 'm not saying it was ok , what i 'm saying is ; those land were ethnically polish ( ~ 60 % ) - belarussian ( ~ 23 % ) , we saw those lands as our lands and we took them , i do n't believe it was fair , though back in the days , it was right ( from polish perspective ) thing to do . 
  `` ss galicia cultists '' there are annual marches to commemorite ss galizien , no one is stopping them , have you ever heard of similar marches in germany ? 
   genocidal guys who carried genocide in galicia-volhynia are now heroes of ukraine , that 's fact . 
  there was no polish ss unit , some polish citizens served in wehrmacht , some of them were germans ( germans were 3,1 % of our population ) , there were many forced conscripts , as well as many germanized ethnic poles , who did n't considered themselves poles , 68k were captured by brits , 53k of them enlisted to polish armed forced in the west . 
  poles who helped german regime were considered traitors and most of them were sentenced for treason and punishment for that was death , so they were executed by polish undeground state . 
  we do n't call them heroes , we are ashamed of them , but they were less than 20k in nation of 36mln , and they were punished . 
   `` maybe you should n't really worship nazis and their collaborators ''  sorry , we are not interested in polish folk history . 
  yep , it 's not like it 's your history , maybe it 's time to stop denying collabaration with germans , commiting genocide and gloryfying people like bandera or szuchewycz , seriously guys , post stamps with these guys ? 
  have anyone seen post stamps with himmler or hitler in germany issued by deutsche post in xxi century ? 
  [ ss galizien ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss_ ( 1st_galician ) ) [ general collaboration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_collaborationism_with_the_axis_powers ) [ ethnic cleansinings in galicia-vohlynia region - sloughtering everyone simply for not being ukrainian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ), 
  yep it was , eg . 
  haitian revolution / s poles helped them fighting for freedom \u00a9 though . 
  edit : spelling, 
   first generation of refugees or immigrants is often lost ( to workforce etc. ) . 
  though it 's 2nd and 3rd generations that radicalise and kill natives in the west . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  the main point is , we need poles of x origin in 2-3 generations , not x minority after 2-3 generations . 
  assimilating small minority in homogenous country is manageable , but assimilating 3mln people in country with native population of 36-38mln is just a wet dream . 
  vietnamese minority in poland , while 1st generation speaks broken polish and consider themselves vietnamese , 2nd generations very often have polish names ( like jan , anna , bartosz etc. 
  ) , they have no problem with polish language , they consider themselves polish and are considered polish . 
  there is one point though , counting 1st generation , 2nd generation and students from vietnam there 're ~ 60 thousands of vietnamese people in poland , not 600 thousands or 1 mln . 
  not really , i have plenty of ukrainian friends who moved here to work by agencies ( like otto , or arcus group ) , they get you place to sleep , food , work , they also take care of all that visa 's stuff . 
  my friends started with low paying jobs , learned the language and now they have permanent residency and many of them have their normal job , like accounting , lower management , teaching etc. 
  and they 're from many different places in ukraine like lw\u00f3w , charkiv , poltava , mariupol area , sumy etc. 
  it 's not that bad , i have ukrainian friend from mariupol , he 's now in poznan , he 's working and studying and things are going pretty well for him , he learned the language , he still 've got his accent though , but no one really cares . 
  well , after war they were doing what 's best for their country , it was no good for mine , but still doing best for ** their ** country . 
  map you posted was dmowski 's conception for post wwi poland , he wanted to establish multi ethnic state , with poles as dominant nation as heir of commonwealth . 
  he was big fan of social darvinism , and he believed that polish nation culture , by being the strongest and dominant culture in plc v2 .0 will led to assimilation of other ethnic groups . 
  he lost to pi\u0142sudski after all . 
  as i made clear what is on the map , i hope you realise , that no one here is claiming `` that would be poland if not for this bloody ruskies '' 2nd is important conception of federation state that could actually be european power , not just local one , it did n't worked out after all . 
  still completelly different thing than `` great ukraine - fap to - map '' , or `` we need living space '' germans . 
  i hope you clearly can see difference, 
  of course it would , maybe except galicia , carpathian region , kuban region , polesie , sloboda ukraina , crimea , bessarabia . 
  map you posted is just wet dream , nothing else mate , it 's especially funny , that there a lot of cities and regions were ukrainians were minority in 1919 , are aware of that ? 
  btw . 
  on map that op posted there 's a mistake , that was n't territory of ukraine in 1654 , but territory of zaporozhian hetmanate . 
  yep , it 's close enough that i can understand a lot of it , i 'm in czech republic once-twice a year , i never bothered to learn the language except for basic stuff like dobry den etc. 
  mostly becouse if i ca n't communicate in english using polish is usually enough . 
  though it 's important for poles to remember differences , stuff like `` i 'm looking for '' etc , in polish it 's `` szukam '' in czech the same word ( different spelling though ) is for `` fucking ( ? ) '',
