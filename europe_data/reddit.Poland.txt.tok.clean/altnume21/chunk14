  poluania * my friend, 
  pi\u0142sudski was pole from lithuania , therefore lithuanian ( as of lithuania , a region , not a baltic state ) , 
  not trying to play devil 's advocate but :  polish minority being beaten up/having their rights limited by the belarusian state . 
  considering they live in authoritarian country they 're nowadays getting same shit as regular citizens , however what 's happened in mid-00 's is unecceptable . 
   they regularly hold military excercises with russia next to our border , simulating shit like taking over the suwalki corridor and even a nuclear strike on poland we 're are having military exercises too , they train with russia whos enemy is west ( now including poland ) we train with west whos enemy is russia ( including belarus ) . 
  that 's why it 's so important to get belarus on our side . 
   they also smuggle a ton of illegal goods into our country , mostly cigarettes . 
  well , that 's matter of border guard , polish and belarussian as well . 
  except for those military drills they are not a bad neighbour and if they could be ally neighbour that would be good , do n't you think ? 
  last time lithuanian ruled our country we annexed wilno and you were pretty upset about it . 
  you can count us in , 
   personal i do n't like him one bit but it could be a lot worse : / this is the point . 
  he is dictator but after all he is reasonable politician , like someone mention before he is not an external threat to his neighbours . 
  nato may not want belarus in , but better have neutral belarus cooperating with nato as buffor state than belarus cooperating with russia as buffor state . 
  when it comes to eu i 'm not sure why eu would n't take them after reforms and i 'm pretty shure eu would throw some euroz as an investment . 
  from signing papers to taking belarus into eu there is very long way and belarus did n't even sign the papers , so do n't worry . 
  edit : putin might let them go as long as they do n't join nato etc. 
  it seems he can not afford to another donbass . 
  though belarus is in completely different position , their western neighbour does not want to erase belarussians from the surface . 
  the bigger problem is their economy which would need a lot of cash if there would be no oil from russia . 
  that 's what lukashenko is afraid of since donbass happened . 
  he 's been trying to cut of russia since crimea happened , but right now russian is donbass where everyone looks , it 's very close to belarus so looks like they hope they 'll be able to break without same shit happening to them . 
  democratisation is not only getting to elect the government it is also about a freedom of people , about the work of special services etc. 
  and that takes time . 
  ever heard of donbass conflict ? 
  he 's afraid of loosing his country , we may like him , we may not like him , but this dude was balancing beetween east and west for really long time and comparing to ukraine it was not that bad for his country . 
  anyway , looks like it 's the end of balancing and he finally chose side . 
  turning to the western and central europe . 
  you know , they are n't bad neighbour , they might have `` cold '' relations with us , or balts , but those were cold as `` we 're close to russia '' not cold as `` you can go fuck yourselves '' , no bad blood between them and poland , good historical past . 
  with slow democratisation and getting rid of death penalty , they actually might be able to join the eu before ukraine . 
   they do n't want their own . 
  it 's not like we do n't want our own nukes , we sign some treaty and can not obtain them legally . 
  nah , at this point poorer countries would be countries outside eu . 
  why trouble if you can employ people from there . 
  it is simply not true . 
  not to mention `` unreliable '' source . 
  i realise what you 're trying to point , however statistics and local sharia law in muslim countries ! = gossip , daily mail/the sun and native , conservative , christian society . 
  quit that bullshit . 
  that 's true , however muslims take their faith very seriously comparing to native europeans and muslim fundamentalists are way bigger part of their societies than christian fundamentalists here . 
  he will stay , that 's for sure , but is it somehow possible that belarus would finally turned west ? 
  i get it now . 
  we have something similar in poland , it 's something called compromise . 
  when we got our independence back in early '90s we still had a lot of commie law which , in certain issues , was very liberal , like for example abortion . 
  our society is quite conservative so abortion was banned in 90 's , however like i mentioned before it 's compromise beetween left ( which is very weak in poland ) and right that while abortion on demand is illegal , abortion itself is legal when health/life of mother is at risk or it is known that fetus is , i ca n't find good expression , `` defective '' / `` heavily impaired '' . 
  same will probably happen with registered partnerships , it 's just a matter of time , though no chance for marriages , since `` marriage is between man and a woman '' according to polish constitution . 
  well , i 'd start with `` it 's ok for any thoughts '' , we are not living in 1984 , there is no thoughtcrime yet . 
  however if you 'd like to support lgbt + people where is the point in supporting them while you import hardcore muslim conservatives ( yep , they are more conservative than local christian conservatives ) ? 
  it 's like `` ooo i like how those sheeps live here , it 's so nice '' and you 're going to buy some wolves ` couse they have right to live with sheeps in the same field . 
  well , in that case your lawmakers went full retard . 
  on the other hand you have gay marriages , how does it work ? 
  so you are comparing people that do n't wa n't legalize gay marriages with people who fully legal stone/hang/throw gays of the building for having sex and then you 're trying to use the worst ( ok , 2nd worst ) tabloid in uk as a source . 
  do you wan na be treated like a joke you just made or average , sane person ? 
  yeah , but what exactly was that material . 
  ` couse questioning that is for example saying `` crimea was never truly ukrainian , it should n't be ukrainan '' and posting it . 
  since , that 's like , you know , my opinion , it shocks me that i could go to jail in ukraine for stating my opinion on that matter , what shocks me even more is that country that can jail you for your opinion wants to join eu . 
  well , tatars served well poland for ~ 400 years , ` couse no problems and there are ~ 2000 of them and what 's important they consider themselves polish and are considered polish , unlike ~ 1mln immigrants from mena countries from last year . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe#/media/file:central_europe_ ( brockhaus ) . png, 
   why the hell would we want to take the poor ( by their standards ) people in the first place ? 
  ` couse when you have very low unemployment there are a lot of low paying jobs that natives wo n't take , that 's when poor people from poor countries are getting invited . 
  well , considering that most of european christians are catholics , and roman catholic church on bible is :  ** since god speaks in sacred scripture through men in human fashion ** , the interpreter of sacred scripture , in order to see clearly what god wanted to communicate to us , ** should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended ** , and what god wanted to manifest by means of their words then bible is not considered to be the final , perfect word of god , but final perfect word of god written by man in mans matter , therefore ** do not interpret it literally ** . 
  edit : i used your source . 
  remember that christian fundamentalists in europe might have pro-life marches , pro traditional marriages marches , but they 're not actual danger . 
  not really , they are natives , all you can do is speak with them , try to make them agree with you on certain issues . 
  btw . 
  what europeans 've problem with women 's right ? 
  what statements did they made ? 
  what kind of `` anti-ukrainian materials '' their group `` housed '' ? 
  we 're missing here very important data . 
  from backing to establishing it is a vary long way . 
  yep , though except for bosniaks in bosnia and former yugoslavia/balkans and albanians in albania/balkans those native european muslims are statistically insignificant . 
  for example former polish lithuanian commonwealth tatars , those guys are counted as `` natives '' due to their assimilation and guess what , there are ~ 7000 lipka tatars in belarus ( 9mln people ) , ~ 3000 lipka tatars in lithuania ( 3mln ) and ~ 2000 lipka tatars in poland . 
  therefore statisticaly speaking almost all of native europeans are christian/of christian cultural background , so assumption that when it comes to circumcision native europeans * do it mostly due to medical reasons unlike non native muslims who do it due to religious purposes . 
  * with exception for bosniaks , albanians , lipka tatars and proselytes , last two are insigificant in every country . 
   but it also is obviously a philosophical debate - there are arguments for both sides . 
  i guess we can agree to disagree . 
  right ? 
  that 's why you can mix `` progressive tax '' and `` flat tax '' by having high enough tax-free income , let 's say half yearly/yearly minimal wage and flat 20 % on everything above that . 
  that helps very low income tax payers and make it simple and quite fair for everyone . 
  that 's something called compromise . 
   ... how absurd eli5 why is flat tax absurd ? 
  progressive tax is extremely unfair , the more you make , the bigger part your own state is going to take from you . 
   most ` mgm ' / circumcision is done out of medical necessity . 
  ( pain , inflammation , problems with peeing ) to native europeans , it 's different with muslims/jews who do it just becouse of religion purposes . 
  you just explained it , turkey has strategic location , first of all it closes black sea , therefore southern fleet of russia and many supplies to russia , secondly you 're basically europe 's wall when it comes to the middle east . 
   because ~ ~ serbia ~ ~ ukraine doesnt have any effective control over ~ ~ kosovo ~ ~ crimea . 
  its independent now and it isnt changing . 
  i 'm sorry , but it 's fucking ridiculous , when albanians ethnically cleansed kosovo and made kosovo `` independent '' it 's all ok , kosovo , place as important for serbs as greater poland for poles , champagne for french etc. 
  but when crimea , place with litterally less than 20 % ukrainians , that was never ukrainan joined russia everyone is mad , i simply do not get it . 
  electric heating is the most expensive way to heat your place here , while gas heating second most expensive , most people can affford gas heating , they simply do n't care/are used to coal/wood heating . 
  it 's not becouse of big energy plants , those have very strict norms to keep , it 's mostly becouse average kowalski do not give a single fuck about what he 's burning and how he 's burning it , not to mention any filters in his chimney . 
  image what mongols , i mean russians have to feel . 
  well , when soviets came to german-occupied europe they were literally stealling factiories , almost everything that had some value and use was stolen by them , a lot of just destroyed , but hey , they were `` liberators '' . 
  german built breaslau , poles rebuilt what was left of breslau in 1945 and change that city , therefore it 's built by poles . 
  those trains were also known as `` luxtorpeda '' and they were able to go as fast as 140km/h , this is nothing new , but in 1930 's that was amazing for a train . 
  right , there are `` irish travellers '' too . 
   finland ended on kill 'em all, 
  naa , just average post soviet citizens , most of them speak only ukrainian/russian/surzhyk though slavic languages are very close so it takes relatively little time for them to be able to communicate freely . 
  whole `` pretty cool ukrainian immigrants '' experience might and probably will be completely different for not post-commie , non slavic western european countries , due to many many diferences beetwen piss poor ukraine and western europe . 
  you know , they come here , work , do not blew up themselves and natives , there 's no ghettoisation , crimes are pretty pretty much the same per capita as they were before ukrainans came here , as long as there wo n't be too much of ukrainans in poland , i 'm , as well as most of the poles are down with them comin ' here and taking our ( lowest paying ) jobs . 
  and re-establish plc !,
