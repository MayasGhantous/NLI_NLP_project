   no protection from the provision of goods and services it 's illegal to ** not ** sell stuff/provide services for people with exception for alcohol ( when you 're drunk , though , no one care ) / certain medical stuff ( pharmacologists/medical doctors can say they wo n't do/sell you something , like for example day after pill becouse of their beliefs ) , other that people ** have to ** sell you stuff/provide services , that 's the law here , so there 's no special treatment for lgbt + people becouse they are already included . 
   hate speech well , our penal code says it 's illegal to insult/beat other `` person '' / `` human '' i do n't see how we ( lgbt + ppl ) are legally not enough protected , we are not a special snowflakes and last time i checked lgbt + people still were people/humans so as such were protected by polish law . 
   did n't pretty much all of britain endorse fighting a war over some rocks in the south atlantic dude , you can attack uk for many things , but falklands are n't one of them . 
  that 's why i like freedom of speech so much . 
  it 's not `` like '' the reader was mocking christians , he did mock them , he openly denied something that is foundation of christianity . 
  imagine going to mosque and giving speech about how mohammed the desert pedophile was n't actually a prophet but just a scam , pedophile and murderer . 
  such things are matter of local government and it is generally accepted , since there 's no law about how you should measure distance between school and store with alcohol licence sometimes it is measured from school fence , sometimes from school doors , sometimes from school gate . 
  when it comes to freedom of speech central/eastern europe is better ( more free ) than western europe , we had communism , we actually know how it is to not be able to speak what you think . 
  you are aware that those far right dudes protest was about what happened in cologne last year . 
  they are not trying to impose nazism , they 're pretty much saying `` sexually harrasing women is not ok , we are not ok with that , we are pissed '' . 
  do n't they have a right to their own opinion ? 
  is sexually harassing women ok ? 
  or is defending women wrong when you are far right ? 
  it 's good for their ( chinese ) economy , why should n't we invest or as you may prefer `` invest '' in africa ? 
  bull , you really can get plane ticket nyc-eu for like 500-600 euros . 
  he like guns and he is not leftist , therefore literally neo-nazi and probably hitler . 
   they still are , fuck off with that shitty argument . 
  why is it shitty argument ? 
  refugee is a person that seeks refuge , in few words ; shelter , peace . 
  refugee is not a person that seeks german euros instead of liras or forints . 
  so what you are saying is we should give them access to our market , give them money and hope they will take their citizens back ? 
  are you sane person ? 
  that would hurt our economy badly . 
  traditionally it 's fat based cream that keeps your skin from drying , cracking etc. 
  in low temperatures . 
  proper ushatka and you are good to go . 
  eu statistics are nowadays strawman ` couse they do n't portray those slavs as backward people ? 
  good one . 
   classic east-european racists that 's xenophobia my friend, 
  actually eastern/central europe is safer for woman than western, 
  more liberal , in good sense of that word , than rest of former eastern block countries . 
  i 'm complaing about coloured models advertising ** clothing ** in poland just becouse it 's difficult for me figured out if those clothing will look good on me , but that 's me . 
  i 'm mean , what 's the point of using coloured models to advertise clothing in a country that is literally 99,9 % white. , not 9,99 % white , not 70 % white , ** 99,9 % ** white . 
  i 'm centre-right guy ( for polish standards ) and i 'm voting razem next time since there 's no centre-right/libertarian party that would satisfy me and there 's no leftist opposition in our parliament atm and razem will probably be better leftist opposition to pis/po - . n than sld ( ex-commies , caviar left ) . 
  no it is not , are you aware that same colour look differently on different skin tones/colours ? 
  and hungary , romania , moldova, 
  everywhere where somalis live they couse damage socially . 
  40 % alcohol can easily freeze in those temperatures ( it freeze in -30 c ) , that 's why 70-80 % moonshine was invented . 
  in that case self defense would be moving to normandy/brittany/s, 
  unluckily it 's illegal here , it 's either range , hunting or not shooting at all . 
  your are right , but but generally speaking cypriots are of greek origin in the same way poles are slavic or estonians ugro finnic . 
  not really , nicosia is capital of cyprus , inhabitants of cyprus are cypriots , people of greek origin , using greek langauge , having european culture . 
  so nicosia , geographically being city in mediterranean island close to continental asia has very little to do with asia , like , for example mersin , southern anatolia , just by the fact that it is in allegedly european country , in my opinion due to their culture , language , history etc. 
  is not european . 
  it really depends on a country and on source they 're using , in poland for example according to catholic church ~ 96-8 % of our population are ** members ** of catholic church , and legally , becouse of baptism , they are , however when it comes to census collected data ( state runs censuses , they 're very accurate ) only 87,6 % ( and 96 % of believing ) population consider themselves members of catholic church ( 7 % of population did n't answer question about their faith ) . 
  that 's why when it comes to poland you get ~ 90 % catholics . 
  `` what does it have to do with europe ? '', 
  from pole  more seriously though , mersin is in asia , it has as much to do with europe as damascus or almaty , kazahstan . 
  and you ruined everything . 
  as `` cheap '' , not low quality , you know , croatia is not pricey place , though it is very nice country , such places as diocletian palace in split , dubrovnik , those beautiful lakes near bosnia border are wonderful . 
  not worse , just different from `` made by polish person '' . 
  polish chavs , not skinheads . 
  where ? 
  it 's not like it has something to do with they 're cultural background , not skills . 
  only 650 ? 
  that 's progress , in 2014 they burned slightly over 1000 cars, 
   ethnic groups no ethnic groups here , just foreigners with completely different cultural background and local chav . 
   we 'd be talking about the heroic polish shopkeeper who stopped a muslim terrorist from blowing up his business . 
  was lethal force necessary ? 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  would it be viewed as necessary or even brave if the shopkeeper was a polish catholic and the guy with the firecracker was muslim ? 
  quite likely . 
  however it did n't happened . 
  what happed is : one ( probably drunk ) young ( 21 ) idiot threw firecracker into kebab place , four ( 4 ) muslim foreigners stabbed that idiot to death . 
  what that young pole did was stupid and inappropriate , however actions taken by that four guys are completely unacceptable . 
  in poland if those immigrants just beat ( as couple bruises , not few broken bones ) that guy to teach him a lesson whould be seen as inappropriate , however somehow acceptable . 
  but killing a guy over firecracker ? 
  that 's completely overreaction , especially when we 're talking about four guys on one . 
  so just stop making it the other way around . 
  good ale . 
  known for their `` shitty '' roads in netherlands , though that 's more of stereotype . 
  they 've got many statues of leopold ii , kongo owner . 
  2 main ethnic groups , flemish people and the other ones / s. 
  a lot of non europeans , especially in brussels . 
  good fries . 
  chocolate . 
   this is not really a conversation i wish to have . 
  i understand and respect that , have nice day mate . 
  you know , hitler erased assimilating minority and many people who had for example jewish grandparent , people who were fully asimilated , like polish of jewish origin/poles of jewish faith . 
  stalin changed our borders and that 's how we got rid of problematic minority . 
  in my opinion what hitler did was way worse for us as a country and as a nation . 
   more like the exact opposite . 
  slovakia and the czech lands did not have a `` shared history '' until 1918 they did n't ? 
  what about austria and later austria-hungary ? 
  you forgot hitler , it 's not like he got rid of our 3rd biggest ethnic group . 
  though having homogenous country is not that bad after all , to be clear i 'm not talking about how that homogeneity happened , i 'm talking how it is with homogeneity and it 's pretty good , no religious minority problems , like with before wwii , no separatists movements/terrorists , like ukrainians in poland before wwii , like kurds in nowadays turkey , no `` opressed minority '' claims . 
  homogeneity might be boring , but i prefer boring over dangerous and you have to agree that poland is actually quite safe country . 
  polish hools are fighting without `` tools '' , exception for cracow area , when it comes to hools killing is extremely rare , beating is usually all . 
  source : i grew up in rough neighbourhood . 
   nothing to do with morons demolishing someone 's else property and getting stabbed in the process . 
  dude , polish guy literally threw firecracker , he got stabbed . 
  it 's like wearing short skirt , walking thru muslim naighbourhood and getting raped , but hey , she asked for it , at least that 's what you 're trying to say . 
  guess what , stabbing is not accepted in our culture . 
  you know , when those muslims just stubbed someone over the firecracker then they are , well , not welcome . 
   all i 'm saying is that the ubiquitous baldness/buzzcut was very noticebale in my few days i spent in poland . 
  yes it is , you know you 're in poland when you see all those bald people , kebabs and ugly `` bilboards '' everywhere . 
  i 'm 21 and a lot of my friends ( and i ) are bald/have realy short hair becouse they naturally lost a lot of their hair . 
  i have no idea how it is in austria though in poland if you 're loosing hair it 's completely fine to have really short hair/be bald , no reason to shame/make laugh , and trust me having really short hair/being bald is comfy as hell , i had really long hair and now i 'm bald . 
   tell that to the americans dying from the gun culture over there . 
  tell that to swiss ( 45/100 ) , scandinavians , germans and french with their 30guns/100ppl .
