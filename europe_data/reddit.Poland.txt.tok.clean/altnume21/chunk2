  yep , not civilians but soldiers of ukrainian insurgent `` army '' . 
  upa and oun were only able to sloughter civilians , but when home army arrived somehow they could n't handle real underground army . 
   killing those representatives of the polish regime responsible for the occupation of your homeland on your own land was a liberation struggle , '' fight with regime = sloughtering civilians ? 
  why should we ? 
  i 'm waiting for arguments . 
  yeah , i do n't blame'em , they 're fighting for their own country . 
  we , poles were bombing and assasinating , robbing trains and banks in `` russian part of poland '' during partitions period in early xxth century . 
  for 5 years there were like 2-4 bombings a ** day ** . 
  one of train robberies was called [ prime minister train robbery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bezdany_raid ) . 
  `` boj\u00f3wki '' was probably the most woman equally terrorist organisation 'till one of kurdish organisations . 
  we 're calling that law `` prawo nie dzia\u0142a wstecz '' which is pretty much word by word translation of `` lex retro non agit '' . 
  but it 's just polish , in our language it 's quite common to use polonised latin terms . 
  for example name `` rzeczpospolita '' is just translation of latin `` res publica '' - `` common thing '' both in latin and polish , but i guess it does n't sound in english as good as `` commonwealth '' . 
  we still use term `` rzeczpospolita polska '' as official name of our country , not `` republika polska '' even though it means exactly the same . 
  however we call all other republics `` republika '' not `` rzeczpospolita '' . 
  how industrial revolution ruined million of lives ? 
  it pretty much pushed money to lower classes , so after 3-4 generations ( early xxth century ) people actually could afford education for their children , medical care etc. 
  capitalism combined with industrial era was not revolution , it did n't cost milions of live . 
  it was pure evolution , communism on the other hand was the most murderous ideology , but hey , they were `` revolutionarist '' fighting for `` common people '' and e.g. 
  last time i checked 7 mln people living in the most fertile land of europe died becouse of hunger in ussr . 
  i know , but frankly speaking we are the ones who make international law . 
  also who will enforce us to obey nowadays international laws , as eu we are the most powerful country , there 's pretty much nothing others can do about it . 
  if they leave assigned country ( greece , austria etc. ), 
  they should deported . 
  ` couse leaving assigned country means you do n't care about asylum . 
  i 'm against forced `` sharing '' , if some country is ok with sharing , not `` sharing '' , then ok , let them take migrants . 
  definitelly forced `` sharing '' is not ok , let as take care of our immigrant policies . 
  if `` a '' country is saying `` ok , come , we can host you '' and then is trying to force other countries to take some migrants that came to `` a '' country it 's just not ok , especially that `` a '' is using non-democratic structures of eu to push that . 
  ( yes , i 'm pointing at you germoney ) . 
   these politicians are fascists what do you expect from eu , non-democratic organization ? 
  ( i 'm not talking ` bout e-parliament , meps have very little power ), 
  problem with `` capitalism hate '' ( i understand that not everyone have to like it ) is that it leads to socialism , and as lenin said `` the goal of socialism is communism . '', 
  and unluckily my country know what communism is . 
   pull the rug out from under 1,950 foreigners who have already satisfied the current requirements . 
  i thought that `` lex retro non agit '' , do n't you have that rule in your law danes ? 
  i do n't get this whole `` capitalism-hate '' in media nowadays . 
  that 's why ( partly ) why we are richer than most of the world . 
  ` couse we worked smarter and harder than others . 
  edit : some people might start we `` colonialism '' argument . 
  well , that 's not correct , only some western countries had colonies , not all of them, 
   white capitalist supremacys of europe please eli5 and why do you believe it 's wrong . 
  no they do n't deserve beating from police , let judge give them punishment , not police . 
   those are currently richer parts of poland from all new lands only , part of lower siliesia , gda\u0144sk and wroc\u0142aw are quite rich right now . 
  the rest , especially in `` lubusz region '' and `` western pomerania '' it 's not so good . 
   most of the yes voters were also young . 
  that 's not relevant , if they are citiezens and they have right to vote you ca n't say , `` oo they 're young/old/right / left '', 
  it 's sad that they 're such bigots , they just saw red cross and they refused , looks like they wo n't be able to appreciate european progressive society . 
  quite small castle built by silesian duke henryk in xiiith century . 
  for 200 years siliesian dukes owned town but in xvth century it became part of brandeburg and castle became residence for widows after brandeburgian electors . 
  during ~ 1550s castle was modified in renaissance style . 
  during thirty years war swedes occupied my town , they rebuilded castle to more defensive than residential purposes , but after all russians cuptured the castle and partially destroyed it . 
  in xviiith and xixth century it was just prussian military base . 
  in early xxth century germans built bunkers near castle ( it was quite important part of middle odra river and only bridge in 100km range ) . 
  during wwii soviets burned old town and castle . 
  after the war , town became part of poland and during communist period castle was n't rebuild at all . 
  in last 25 years we rebuilt gate-tower part , old chapel , and one residential part . 
  there 's still a lot of to rebuilt but we ca n't afford it ( yet ) nowadays we 've got there little local museum and `` cultural-artistic centre '' which pretty much means it 's place for various concerts , shows etc. 
  ( blues , rock , classical music etc. ) . 
  in last summer local ngo organized in the courtyard classic horrors nights .

  oh , spaniards , looks like you 're not tolerant enough . 
  have said it 's ok ? 
  no , i did not but when it comes to slaves not west but arab , or actually muslim world was dominating that part of market . 
  ottomans were enslaving a lot of people from balkan region , arabs enslaved africa and nomads with turks were enslaving people from nowadays ukraine and southern-western russia . 
  all i 'm saying is `` our '' , western part of slave market was very little , hell , `` we '' were buying slaves straight from african blacks , they were delivering them to `` us '' , traders . 
   enslavement of africa arabs were first when it comes to `` enslavement '' of africa . 
  we still have lack of infrastructure , though it 's getting better . 
   we existed !, 
  no one 's saying you did n't , though lithuanian population in wilno in 1931 was less than 1 % of general population [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilnius#demographics ) . 
  it was polish city . 
  rapes - for that you have to thank red army . 
  poles had nothing to do about that . 
  about casualties - they died mostly becouse of cold , lack of food , bombing . 
  for the last one thank red army , not poles . 
  about cold and lack of food , germans and reds destroyed our country so badly we often were n't able to provide for ourselves basic products , my grandfather in 1942-1949 had only one pair of shoes , winter ones . 
  so for most of the year he had walk on his bare feet . 
  seizing their possesions was seen as part of war reparations . 
   saying the germans were treated like humans is cynical it is not . 
  at the time , shortly after they lost the war during which they treated poles like subhumans , those `` subhumans '' showed them mercy and treated germans not bad . 
  well there is the same problem with wilno ( nowadays capital of samogitia ) , in 1931 they were 0,8 % of population , now they 're claiming it `` their city '' . 
  how about lw\u00f3w ? 
  in 1926 ukrainians barely made 9 % of population and now it 's `` their '' city . 
  as you probably know `` allies '' screwed both of us over , the most unfair thing is my country was victim and after all we were treated by allies worse than reich . 
  a few as `` you should be happy we are treating you like human beings , quite opposite than you treated us '' . 
  i believe it was right , as far as i remember no one forced you to start the war , and majority ( ~ 70 % ) germans on lands you lost voted for hitler so pretty much they wanted more labensraum for germans , they 've done labensraum for us :d, 
  more like 85 % , not german but prussian , historically it was our city , prussians stole it :( edit : it was very important city on baltic coast , and it 's basically vistula 's estuary , who controlled gda\u0144sk , controlled great part of our trade : /, 
  good job , seriously , great timing , ` couse ussr was in civil war , they were pushing west etc. 
  but you 've done great job , especially for such ( territorially , demographically ) small country . 
  we are not doing this again , we 've at least twice saved west , twice they attacked us after all . 
  this time we 're staing at home with cup of coffee and live transmission from vienna . 
  we also rather accept christian ` fugees and migrants , so muslim ones could go to muslim countries like france , uk , sweden , germany . 
  it 's quite popular pov in poland , seriously . 
  in schools it 's more like , `` we lost the war , we lost eastern poland , 20 % of our population was murdered , country destroyed , soviet march through led to massive amounts of rapes , soviets stole almost everything from ( nowadays ) western poland , so at least we get back polish gda\u0144sk and ( nowadays ) western poland was given to us . 
  aaa and most germans in ( nowadays ) western poland voted for hitler ( like 70 % , seriously ) . '', 
  so pretty much it 's sad we lost eastern territory , good we were given western territory , no one cares about germans couse you started it . 
  that 's how it looks like in polish schools . 
  i agree we had no claims to lower silesia , eastern brandeburg ( nice place though ) , pomerania . 
  yet we had nothing to say , no one asked us , we lost beautiful eastern poland , cities like wilno , lw\u00f3w ( great mathemathic university ) , grodno . 
  `` recovered territory '' - it 's just commie propaganda , but many people actually believe that . 
   secular continent what i meant was that european values are ( in big part ) based on christanity .
