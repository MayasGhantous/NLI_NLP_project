  perhaps it is , i 'm no linguist , just native polish language user , 
  here `` studzi\u0107 '' = to cool . 
  like cooling meal , or tea if it 's too hot . 
  zimno means cold , while zima means winter . 
  so literally cold is `` wintery '' though , no one thinks of it this way . 
  you know , there 's big difference between our societes , our countries . 
  france is very secular , post colonial , from our perspective welfare state . 
  poland did n't had colonies , so we do n't have any ties and do n't feel like we have any commitments to poor 3rd world countries . 
  since welfare is almost non existent in poland we have to help people through for example ngo not government . 
  and finally when there was no poland on maps for 123 years catholic church was one the organizations that helped keeping polish people polish , helped us survived as a nation so while officialy all religion are treated the same in poland , catholic church is kind of special , both in society as in law . 
   how do you say that middle bit with fluency well , it takes practice , you 're not dumb , you 're just inexperienced . 
  sz - sh ( like `` shorts '' ) cz - ch ( like `` cheap '' ) start slowly with sh , ch , sh , ch , sh , ch , sh , ch etc. 
  then try shch , shch . 
  and do n't worry if it ai n't perfect , it 's great that you 're at least trying . 
  still no one except slovaks , czechs and poles will be able to read that correctly . 
   but that does n't look pronounceable ...  pol-sh-ch-isna try now . 
   i do n't speak polish , but my vote 's for this `` polski '' . 
  on daily basis you 're right , but officialy name of our language is `` j\u0119zyk polski '' - `` polish language '' . 
  it says `` j\u0119zyk polski '' ` couse that 's official name of our language , not `` polski '' but `` j\u0119zyk polski '' . 
  oh , i did n't knew that . 
  in poland caritas is the biggest charity organisation , they do literally everything , delivering free food to the poor , warm meals for poor and homeless , trips for kids , shelters for kids , shelters for homeless , adpotions , running some orphanages etc. 
  caritas is trying to help on domestic issues . 
  is it really a threat ? 
  i wan na make money , if things will be bad for me here i 'll move elsewhere . 
  that 's pretty normal if you ask me . 
  in poland it 's more of a guide not rule . 
  try catholic church ngos , for example caritas , they are actually doing their job , at least in poland . 
  ` couse they were , who does n't like soviets with their guns , tanks , airplanes and nkvd ? 
  if you believe that all peoples lives matters , whether their jews , poles , armenians , ukrainians , tatars , chinese etc. 
  and considering that soviets actually killed way more people than nazis i ca n't understand the argumentation that somehow nazis were less evil than soviets . 
  that 's coming from someone whos family was classified as `` subhumans '' under one regime and `` enemy of the people '' under the other . 
  ` couse people will defend their rights to own stuff , to have their own political and religous beliefs , their own opinions etc. 
  since every single commie regime did that seems it 's connected to ideology . 
  commies did n't ruled in chile . 
   there is no inherent call for murder in communism there is . 
  you ca n't create classless society without death . 
  there was no regime that in order to create classless society did not kill . 
   communism = everything belongs to the people * * as long as those people are not the enemy of the people , then they should be reeducated , by hunger , slave like labour , lead in back of their heads etc. 
  russians as ussr are responsible of at least 15mln lost lives , while chinese commies for at least 45mln lost lives . 
  that 's just two communist regimes , and there were more of them . 
  no , of course they were n't allies . 
  they just together invaded a country , divided it , [ held a military parade together ` couse they divided that country together ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_military_parade_in_brest-litovsk ) but they were not allies . 
  totally makes sense . 
   i do n't think `` do as i say or i 'll kill you '' really compares . 
  it was n't `` do as i say or i 'll kill . 
  seizing other people goods to make them dependent like slaves of a state , forcing people to atheism or they wo n't get a good job , killing people ` couse of their ethnicity [ ~ 111 thousand poles were killed just ` couse they were poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd ) , [ deportations of entire crimean tatars population ` couse they were accused of helping nazis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_the_crimean_tatars ) , [ deportations and basically whole ethnicities and letting them die in harsh environment ` couse apparently whole ethnicity can be enemy of working people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union#deportation_of_social_groups ) . 
  basically enslaving people and forcing them to work in unhumane conditions in gulags ( slave labor camps ) where most of them died . 
  ussr promoted and exported communism to other countries such as china , cambodia etc. 
  what makes them co-responsible of their crimes , of crimes of communism , far more people died ` couse of the communism than ` couse of nazism . 
  how is murdering people ` couse of ideology , ethnicity or their goods any better than murdering people just ` couse of ethnicity ? 
  ` couse you know , soviets did killed more poeple than nazis . 
  i 'm not trying to say that nazis were good guy , but soviets were not any better . 
  that really depends on march , some marches are full of them , some do n't . 
  there are a lot of people in their 30-50 , not just pensioners . 
   that is a bigger problem than obese models inspiring young people to become obese . 
  it 's bad when anorectic models are shown as `` healthy '' as well as it 's bad when obese models are shown not as obese but as `` curvy '' and `` healthy '' . 
  none of those are healthy for young people . 
  we both can agree that anorectic models are ( generally speaking ) bad for teens . 
  but why go from one extreme to another ? 
  as long as they are citizens of turkey they have full right to vote as turkish citizens . 
  they are not dutch before turkish or turkish before dutch , they 're dual citizens . 
  that 's the law . 
  i do not like it either , however problems with 3rd world immigrants in the west did n't start yesterday , they 're effect of long term policy of political correctness , promoting ideology that all cultures are equal , mass immigration from 3rd world backward shitholes like east turkey etc. 
  but hey if you do n't like it and you wan na ( legally ) do something about you 're racist , islamophobic , xenophobic nazi scum that does not deserve right to vote , eu funds and should go fuck him/herself , i get it mate . 
  you know , that 's all they can do . 
   this only proves my point that all religions have their own extreme interpretations . 
  no mate , some religions ** have ** , like islam , some ** had ** , like catholicism . 
   middle east is still struggling with severe poverty . 
  these countries are literally governed by jihadist extremists . 
  poverty indeed increase crime level , however there are no crusaders from south america ready to kill infidels , spread faith by guns and make apostates life harder or significantly shorter , meanwhile there are jihadists who do that shit . 
  problem is not poverty , it 's religion , branch of islam . 
   you are literally condemning entire countries for being poor and uneducated . 
  that 's not cool because some people over there are actually trying to change things . 
  you 're undermining their efforts when you generalize by saying that all muslims are terrorists . 
  this is simply not true . 
  i 'm all for immigration policy , but these stereotypes are n't helping anyone . 
  i never assumed that muslim = terrorist , stoped pushing that agenda . 
  i 'm all over trying to change things over there , in mena region . 
  however when they 're bringing their problems like crimes , whether poverty or religion based it 's are uneccaptable . 
  you ca n't behave like civilized , polite a human being , you ca n't immigrate here . 
  we can not make background check on you ? 
  too bad , you ai n't coming . 
  i like puting safety of my own citizens over foreigners , sorry mate . 
   all religions have their extreme interpretations . 
      remember the crusades ? 
  i was refering to that part . 
  technically if you wan na talk about crusades you have to talk about jihad in iberia and greece and balkans that happened before and during crusades period . 
  anyway crusades happened ~ 600 years ago . 
  that hardcore , infidel killing catholicism does not exist anymore . 
  meanwhile jihadi infidel killing islam exists and is a problem . 
  that 's undemocratic . 
  wether you like or not , in democracy all people , despite their political views are allowed to vote . 
  if they 're not allowed to vote then it 's not democracy and it 's no different than `` counting '' votes on your favor . 
  perhaps it 's time for you to buy your own mig 29s and f16s . 
  have you missed '' / s '' or was this seriously . 
   the core principle of capitalism is pretty fucking simple . 
  it is , but hey , if you can tax the shit out of certain goods ( like alcohol , tabacco , gasoline ) , ban certain goods ( like marihuana ) why the outrage when someone wa n't keep local experience local . 
  technically russia is 2nd world country ( 1st nato/west , 2nd former warsaw pact/ussr , 3rd being rest ), 
  usa first , poland second . 
  stanis\u0142aw august poniatowski was king during declaration of 3rd may constitution .
