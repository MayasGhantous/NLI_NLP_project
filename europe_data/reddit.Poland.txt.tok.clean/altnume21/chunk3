   secular continent muslims ca n't handle secular country , our european values etc. 
  simply fuck them , if they ca n't realise they 're on christan continent they go fuck themselves and go back to their countries . 
  we ( poles ) 've got this tartar ( muslim , far east asian ) minority which does n't feel polish , they consider themselves polish . 
  so it 's possible , but foreign muslims 've got to push away radical islam exactly as our tartars 've done . 
  we do n't give free apartments to ukrainians , though we have this thing , [ pole card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karta_polaka ) . 
  as you may not know we lost a lot of teritorry and population in the wwii you started , so people in former ii polands republic territory nowadays are able to get back to their fathersland ( as long as they know polish and polish tradions culture and they can proove their polish heritage ) . 
  russian ? 
  barbarian language ( for slavic language ) , comparing to polish it sounds like language of handicapped peasant . 
  english ? 
  nowadays lingua franca , it 's easier for us poles to conversate in english with germans than brits . 
  only old people know that language . 
  spanish ? 
  `` yo soy polaco , una cerveza por favor '' , i guess that 's all for most poles . 
  historically ? 
  same as us , poles , great loosers . 
  nowadays ? 
  in one word ? 
  coffee & wine , 
  i guess in next 20-50 years there 'll be an etnically war in europe . 
  i 've had a lot of vodka tonight , it 's time to stop , unluckily i ca n't inherit my great-grandfather usa citizenship , and live in mighty shi-raq ( chicago ) :(, 
  except for katy\u0144 massacre , soviets sentenced over million poles ( not necessarily etnically ) to far away siberia , officially to protect civilians from war , unoficially to break polish spirit , but somehow , even though my family was sentenced to sibieria , and my great-grandparents died there ( i 'm 19 ) i still feel polish , looks like soviet plan was a failure after all , unluckily many poles stayed there becouse bloody ussr in therittory of nowadays kazachastan and southern siberia . 
  i guess you westerns will finally realise why we prefer to get back our people from siberia and kazachstan than muslim migrants . 
  frankly i do n't believe that `` sharing '' both asylum and `` asylum ' ( economic ) migrants will solve africans and middle easterners migration crisis . 
  i believe only stopping their migration ( i do n't care how ) will solve this problem . 
  i believe it 's a problem becouse i 'm afriad our european ( based on mostly christian beliefs and greek philosophy ) culture is best culture and most important culture. , if i 'm wrong correct me . 
  russia still being russia since muscovite grand principality :( edit : our nobles beat you once :p, 
  i 'm definitelly polish ( at least 30 % ethnically , but 90 % culturally , 5 % belarussian , 5 % prussian ) . 
  answering question , i guess there is no other subreddit ( except this one ) with so many europeans about europe though i 'm a little bit drunk . 
  in poland , if you public universities are payed from taxes . 
  at my uni i had to pay 18z\u0142 ( ~ 5e ) for student card and i can have additional insurance for 30z\u0142 ( ~ 7e ) . 
  as a student i also have something like ~ 50 % cut for trains , buses etc. 
  they often are religious , but it 's different than abrahamese religions . 
  skilled : belarus , ukraine ( but very limited ) , vietnam ( we have quite big vietnamese minority ) . 
  unskilled : belarus , ukraine ( but very limited ) , vietnam , china . 
  ` fugees : iran ( but limited ) , they were one of few countries that treated us well during wwii [ vietnamese minority vide wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_vietnamese#poland ) edit : if it have to be only one country then for skilled belarus and unskilled vietnam . 
  annexation of zaolzie - first of all , czechs stole it from us when we were busy fighting commies in 1919-1920 . 
  when it comes to piece of riga , it is important to remember that when polish-ukrainian alliance fought for ukrainian people republic , less than 10 % of alliance soldiers where ukrainian , pretty much ukrainians fault . 
  so please do n't say it like it 's our fault that ukrainians slaughtered polish civilians . 
  frankly , they not only `` looked '' badass , they were best cavarly in xviith century , they lost no battle for 150 years . 
  in 150 years from the most powerful country in europe to non-existing . 
  partitions of poland , and what led to them . 
  our king was n't powerful enough 2 . 
  our nobles were rich , but state was poor 3 . 
  liberum veto blocked reforms 4 . 
  we saved austrians and they were so thankful they backstabbed us we gave too much freedom and privileges to nobles , our state was n't able to mantain big army , couse nobles said they wo n't pay more taxes . 
  when we stopped commies in 1920 , saved western europe and 20 years later they did n't help us and sold us to soviets ( thanks uk , france ) looks like we ca n't learn from our mistakes :(, 
  swedish death camps , you 'll see how annoying can it be : /, 
  maybe try australian way , simply turn them back ? 
  it 's definitelly working for aussies . 
  i 'm betting on belfast xd, 
  as far as i 'm aware knuckle-dusters are not legal in poland , however you can carry pretty much everything in poland . 
  swords , machetes , knives , buttons , pepper spray etc. 
  can be carried as long as they 're hidden ( eg . 
  backpack , pocket ) but if you 're walking on the streets with bare sword/machete , baton in your hand etc. 
  people might be scared , call the police and police might be asking questions but it 's not illegal ( as far as i 'm aware ) though . 
  you misunderstood , by `` problems with roma '' i meant problems with minority , they 're now careful ` couse of their experience . 
  christanity has big influance of european poganism , so animistic influence ca n't be that bad , at least we have more in common than we do with muslims . 
   all that can be expected of people is that they follow the law , learn the language and get a job . 
  if we 're talking ` bout permanent migrants i could n't disagree more . 
  you know what defines nation ? 
  common values , traditions , history , without it there 's no chance it 'll survive . 
   forcing people to adhere to arbitrary cultural elements like traditions is against the personal freedom that is inherent to democracy . 
  why forcing ? 
  you 'll integrate or get out . 
  we do n't need people who will came to ur country and disrespect our culture . 
  i 'm not saing we need no migrants , ` couse , demographically , we do . 
  but we ca n't afford culturaly to accept everyone , ` couse otherwise in next generations we 'll loose our identity . 
  for me it 's better to work hard and fail than behead someone/blow myself for religion of peace . 
  but that 's just pov of european conservative-libertarian who 's not relativist . 
  okay we misunderstood , ` couse i wrote `` integration '' while i meant `` assimilation '' . 
  i also believe to integrate is to fully * respect * other country culture , traditions etc. 
  becouse europes traditions , old values ( which are still important in central europe ) where built on christian foundations it 'll be easier to accept slovakian culture/values for christians than it 'll be for muslims . 
  yeah , but middle eastern and african christians will integrate better than middle eastern and african muslims . 
  it might be not politically corect , but with slovakian problems with roma people i 'm fully understand them . 
  more ? 
  are you serious , nigroes in africa were tribal-fighting since they exist . 
  aztecs were brutally slughtering other tribes in central america . 
  muslim were fighting with everyone and they were trying to counquer europe . 
  tartars conquered almost all central asia , china , russian states , they attacked poland in xii and xiii century . 
  we could talk about wars in human history for weeks and not finish . 
  history of mankind is history of wars , but allmost all wars lead to big technological progress . 
  we , europeans had better technology , so we were able to conquer more lands and people . 
  if we did n't had better tech we would n't be conquerers , we would be just counquered . 
  unions * can * be good in big companies to * protect * their rights , and improve communication between employees and employer ` couse it 's quite difficult to talk with every single employee when you employ couple hundreds/thousands people . 
  like i said , * protect * their rights , not enforce some `` shit '' that leads to fall of the company like in detroit . 
  just curious , how exactly are they `` fucking over workers & the general population '', 
  at the begging i 'd like to say that i 'm not critisizng `` doing okay '' , ` couse we do , i 'd like to just add that ~ 2mln people left poland , which have some influence on unemployment . 
  same problem here , mate . 
  for me it 's not about the money , if those pieces of shit were put 6feet under by state i would n't have to worry of my own safety , while they 're dead they ca n't kill/rape etc. 
  anymore, 
  they have nigroes , just look at the crime rate [ by colour , fbi statistics . 
  ] ( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3 ) while blacks make less than [ 13 % of us society ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_united_states#race_and_ethnicity ) they 're responsible for over 50 % of murders with known offender . 
  when you look at [ those statistics ] ( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43 ) you can surely see white part of their society makes more crime right ? 
  well they 're 72 % of the population , so when you look at the population 72 % of it is responsible for ( on average ) twice amount of crimes as black 13 % of society . 
   it brings back to live no crime victim . 
  but also there 's no chance there 'll be more victims of ( dead ) crimal . 
  for the context : in poland only 300k people pay 32 % tax , most of them 're government employees , so raising it makes no economical sense , it 's just pure populism . 
  even with `` shocking 32 % '' we should : a ) make it 10-15 % for everyone + raise non taxable income ( nowadays it 's 3091zlotys per year , something like 766euros ) b ) get rid of income tax in future , it 's better for all citiezens . 
  it 's just not fair to punish people who make ( finally ) good money . 
  i hope never , becouse it 's only one step more to lost the last pieces of independence our countries have .
