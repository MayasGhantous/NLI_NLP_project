  we are n't yet , 
  those parties are n't `` anti-europe '' they 're anti-union , and union is completely different thing than europe and it 's good old values . 
   look in ukraine absolute majority of people do n't give a fuck about this . 
  this is in no way related to the current situation . 
  if it 's `` no way ralated to the current situation '' and `` absolute majority of people do n't give a fuck about this '' then why do you spit in our face and couple hours after our president visited ukrainian parliament your mps voted for making oun-upa `` national heroes '' and it 's now illegal to say `` bad things '' about them . 
   claims modern ukrainians are fascists because they all love bandera which are both lies no one said modern ukrainians are fascists . 
  this article is about your bandits in upa and it discuss whether ** they 're ** fascist or heroes . 
   they all love bandera i hope you do n't , but if you 're not then please tell me why your parliament made them `` national heroes '' , how can murderes and bandits be `` heroes '' ? 
  please explain it to me , ` couse i just do n't get it . 
  i bet he 's not , about 50-60 % of poles stands for death penalty . 
  depends on statistics , the lowest support for this kind of penalty was 51 % , the highest about 59 % ( 2011 data ) . 
  i , personally , support death penalty because it 's maximum sentence , you just ca n't punish someone harder . 
  it could be great `` reward '' for murderers , mass rapists , terrorists , pedophiles etc. 
  actually it does , if it 's inefficient you have to work more for all tax collection costs and if it 's efficient you have to work less for all tax collection costs . 
  whether it 's efficient or inefficient some of your hard worked money are wasted but efficient system waste less of ** your ** money . 
  in poland sexual orientation is not an issue , having anal sex is also not an issue but if you 've been in central/western africa or thailand you 're rejected . 
  if you had in last 6 months or have now infectious diseases you 're rejected . 
  there 's only one thing we can do to not let that happened , more third world migrants < / sarcasm , 
  nice , 25 years ago we were as poor as ukraine . 
  not bad for 25 years but could be better . 
  it does n't matter who 'll win , it matters who 'll be ally of watermelon party ( green outside , red inside = psl ) . 
  watermelon party almost always is in coalition with ruling party . 
  so far right is often about patriotism or nationalism which is good ( nationalism / = chauvinism ) , or at least there 's nothing wrong about it . 
  right is not only about patriotism , traditional values like family , religion etc. 
  it 's also about ecomony . 
  low taxes , no socialism , capitalism combined with mercantilism , not corporatism . 
  fascist economy was so called third way [ ( more here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economics_of_fascism#general_characteristics_of_fascist_economies ) . 
  it was neither right or left , it was just fascist economy , left 'll say it 's right , right 'll it 's left and it 's just one of a kind . 
  in my opinion nazis and fascists are something beetween both far-left and far-right . 
  no , we ( as eu members ) should just announce publicly that in 3 months since today anyone how will try to cross the eu border illegally will be politely asked twice to stop and go back and third time we 'll start shooting . 
  i bet that after couple shootings , illegalls flood will stop and there will be fewer shitty boats sinkings with illegalls on them . 
  in a long term it 's basically saving ( more ) lives by cost of ( small amount ) of lives . 
  i 'm against poland in eussr , so i 'm also against taking money from them . 
  i 'd like to stay in schengen though . 
  dude , if we 're talking about colonialism in africa there never was `` europe '' , just name those countries that colonised africa like uk or france . 
  for example poland or hungary never had colonies so why should we pay for it ? 
  only jews and tatars . 
  poland was n't multicultural , poland was ** multiethnic ** . 
  it is really a difference . 
  we had live together becouse borders changed , not because they came here . 
  you 've got 0.5 mln migrants ?!, 
  that 's a lot when you compare it to your population ( 10.5 mln ) . 
  i feel sorry for you , eesti . 
   for-profit colleges in poland we had quite big problem with those for last 10 years . 
  you know how it ended ? 
  there is fewer and fewer young people , last year ( 2014 ) 100 so-called `` diploma-printers '' fell . 
  free market will do the job , do n't worry . 
  ** if ** video is true you 're just still the same bandits you were in 1940 's towards unarmed civilians . 
  ** if ** it 's not true you might 've changed . 
  btw . 
  great polish painter - beksi\u0144ski . 
  and there was no lithuanian elite , it was lithuanian-ruthenian elite , most of them , if not all of them were in xviii century polonised . 
  yep , but you have to remember that the most cruel nobles were polish-ruthenian origin , like his majesty wi\u015bniowiecki , also there was a lot ruthenian nobles that polonised . 
  liberum veto was abused becouse of bribes , it was just stupid law , 
  psss , byelarus , do you want into commonwealth ? 
  this time polish-ruthenian . 
  i think he just started counting votes , he 'll be fine , 
  that 's a good idea , our countries need more cooperation and since both czech republic and hungary ( not like baltic states ) have real air force it might work . 
  look like we are not culturally enriched enough , 
   heavily supported the free polish armies best joke ever , you gave us a bill for that . 
   regardless of this we still hosted the polish government in exile regardless of hosting our true government you sold us to people who were worse than germans . 
  all we wanted was independence , not loosing our eastern territory and being sold like axis . 
   the reason we left you is because your military was so pathetic it was n't worth wasting time and resources on a doomed country . 
  you knew how our military looked like when you signed alliance . 
  we managed to fight for about a month , but you have remember that september 17th ussr backstabbed us . 
  so for `` pathetic military '' it 's quite good result to fight with two the most powerful armies at the time . 
  france last 1 month 15 days fighting with germany only . 
  also they 've created vichy state , they were collaborating with germans on big scale , poles did n't . 
  i may not putted it clear , by `` when hitler attacked us '' i meant `` when the war started '' . 
  not angrier , it 's just sad that someone who was your ally ( uk and poland signed allience agreement before wwii ) , someone who was defended by you ( poles won battle of britain , they were the best raf pilots ) , sells you like piece of garbage to people who murdered your nation . 
  it 's just sadness and still lack of trust towards uk . 
  it 's not anger , it 's not hate , uk just dissapointed us . 
  majority of poles still do not believe that in case of war anyone ( except for hungary , but they 're our brothers ) who is our ally will help us . 
  i never said they are , god forbid . 
  but calling organisation who done that `` freedom fighters '' , which your government did is unacceptable . 
  they were called `` cyborgs '' becouse it was small unit , in very difficult to hold place and they hold it for really long time . 
  oun-upa - oun was orgazation of ukrainian natiolists and [ upa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army ) was organisation called ukrainian insurgent army . 
  they 've done [ volhynian slaughter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) they bestially murdered their unarmed polish neighbors . 
  here is [ source in polish ] ( http://prawy.pl/historia/3467-lista-135-sposobow-mordowania-przez-upa ) how poles were killed by ukrainians . 
  i completely understand that what have been done can not be undone but naming oun-upa `` freedom fighters '' is just wrong . 
  there were good ukrainians who helped poles , but we ca n't forgot what oun-upa have done to us . 
  few translated examples ( warning 18 + ) : * cutting nose of * cutting of lips * slitting throat and drawing toungue through hole * cutting of head by sickle * cutting women from vagina to her head by using saw * cutting of women breast by sickle * cutting of mens genitals by sickle * nailing little babies to trees * hanging male kids by their genitals * tearing alive people by using horses, 
  look , you did nothing to help us when hitler attacked us even though we had military alliance and after our guys defended your country during battle of britain ( polish pilots were the best raf pilots during wwii ) you just sold us to way more worse people than nazis , to communists , basically we 're the only ally who lost the war . 
  people who were defending airport were called cyborgs . 
  ukrainians often glorify oun-upa who are murderers of innocent civilians, 
  there is difference beetwen loosing , like you under vienna and murdering milion people , like what you 've done to armenians . 
  yes , becouse they were fighting for indepence , they really did n't have any other options . 
  thanks to brits and americans who sold us to soviets we 're not anymore . 
  there is one big difference , you invaded europe , they were fighting back . 
  armenians did n't invade you , yet you sloughtered them . 
   who ` you ' ? 
  upa/oun , and [ your parliament ] ( http://tass.ru/en/world/788271 ) , the 've done that couple hours after polish president visited it . 
  i ca n't see how murdering polish and jewish civilian-neighbors is fighting for freedom . 
  trust me , when someone spit in my face i will not say it 's raining . 
  if i 'm wrong at law your parliament etablished please send me article in english . 
   ukraine in nato you really thinks that we need your country in nato ? 
  how is that good for nato , please give me some arguments , i mean it , becouse i ca n't see why we should accept you as a member of nato . 
   we have no real support from anyone we 've send you [ bulletproof vests ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/poland-helps-kyiv-buy-2000-nato-type-bulletproof-vests-kevlar-helmets-358911.html ) and humanitarian aid , what more do you expect from us , we 're not in any alliance . 
  we ( poland ) are not in position to send troops to ukraine . 
   imagine if we go full offense on them .
