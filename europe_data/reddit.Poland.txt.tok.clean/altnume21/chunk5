  what would russia do ? 
  we 'll never know 'till you try it . 
  * little part of russian army * , my bad . 
  trust me i have no reasons to defend both russians ( they murdered part of my family , and send a lot of my family members to siberia ) and ukrainians ( you murdered part of my family too ) . 
  but you have big army that pretty much ca n't do anything . 
  sorry mate , but that 's the truth , remember crimea ? 
  russians took part of your territory without single shot , your army just surrendered . 
  c'mon dude , look at the map , think about it , measure distances and you 'll know that 3rd polish republic is central european country . 
  according to [ this source ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing-europe.asp ) you 've got 6th army in europe and you still could n't win with seperatists , for now you 're loosing this war guy . 
  from military point of view it was terrible decision , but from social point of view it was great decision , cyborgs improved morale in army and ukrainians finally get themselves non-murderers heroes . 
  however ukrainians did n't win the war yet and it looks like they will not win it . 
  you should 've learned from us , we have the most long weekends in eu . 
  after all you lost it , did n't you ? 
  that 's good he 's not talking about poland , because poland is pretty much central europe , 
   these countries that you mentioned ... 
  pick any two and then pick any two in eu afterward : there could n't be more difference between picked eu countries then between yours . 
  dude , europe , at least `` old union '' countries , are one of the most developed countries on earth , so really there 's no comparisement . 
  but let me show you this : you are refugee , you lost your home , family etc. 
  where would you go ? 
  * to country with similar culture , religion etc. 
  * to completely defferent country that is far-away from your neighbors countries , and also risk your life on the way there as you can see there is also one very important argument , * money * . 
  if they would like to live in peaceful country they would live in countries i previously mentioned . 
  but becouse they want money , not only peaceful life , after they lost everything they 're risking their lives to go to europe . 
  what `` human rights '' ? 
  i 'm not denying human rights , damn , i 'm bisexual myself . 
  i just believe that we should respect our culture . 
   mediterranean open sea fits ? 
  i do n't care , but using this argument is typical left-wing populism , ` couse as we all know there is no eu land borders . 
  also if they 're up to be deported and w/o papers they 're illegal , if they 're illegal and they would like to live in eu they should 've came here in legal way . 
   what if that would be the part of iraq hold by is ? 
  we 're talking here ` bout migrants , mate , not refugees , your argument is invalid . 
  also if they 're from isis occupied iraq they can claim for assylum in such countries like iran , turkey , kuwait , jordan , on their way to europe are also countries like armenia , israel , liban , egypt . 
  a lot of countries with similar culture and that are completely no war zones but they still would rather risk their life by travelling to europe by boats . 
  a ) just give them [ document for stateless person ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/certificate_of_identity#1954_convention_documents_.28for_stateless_persons.29 ) and leave them at no-one zone between ue border and our neighbours b ) if we know we should just use the cheapest/least comfortable transportation . 
  it 's still cheaper than providing shelter , food etc. 
  for them . 
  even if those two thing have n't had any legal differences in our ( or at least mine , polish ) culture marriage is relationship between man and women . 
  as long as i believe civil partnership with all rights should exist i also believe that it should n't nam it ( by law ) marriage because of cultural background and we should respect and take care of our culture/traditions . 
  speak : * polish * english * spanish ( poor ) would like to speak : * mandarin, 
  back abroad , wherever that is . 
  any other good arguments against jobbik ? 
  and i mean real arguments not `` they 're fucked up '' arguments . 
  also according to `` reddiquette ''  * insults do not contribute to a rational discussion . 
  constructive criticism , however , is appropriate and encouraged . 
  * so please behave like human being and do not insult hungurians . 
   at least they have plans for change in the * right * direction . 
  actually our conservative-libertarian and nationalist parties have plans for real change in ** right ** , non socialist direction , 
  in poland for 50 z\u0142otych ( ~ 12.5 e ) i have unlimited calls ( mobile only ) , sms and 1gb of data , that 's not that bad . 
  for real training like in iraq and afghanistan . 
  i know , but i believe we should restore it . 
  actually we should use them . 
  during communist period we had big and quite modern ( for that time ) army but our soldiers had no real experience . 
  nowadays we have smaller , modern army ( 100k , but only 70k are soldiers ) with experience from yugoslavia , iraq , afghanistan and some onz missions . 
  also according to [ this source ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing-europe.asp ) we have 5th army in europe , not bad for former communist country but we still need some modernizations . 
  i also hope he will not go to jail , he ( ** if he 's guilty ** ) should be hanged , no mercy for murderers ( not killers , it 's small difference ) . 
  today one city , tommorow whole kongo !, 
  translation quoting pi\u0142sudski :  i apologize gentelmans . 
  i 'm very sorry , that 's not how it supposed to be . 
  to ukrainian officcers after treaty of riga ( 1921 ) . 
  actually like one year ago polish ipn ( intytut pami\u0119ci narodowej - institute of national remembrance ) have found documents that prooved germans did that , 
  you also need to remember that in interwar period 2.3 % of our society were pure blood germans with polish citizenship and a lot of people with prussian predessors , many of them `` felt german '' , signed volksliste and after war all stuff they commited is considered `` done by poles '' becouse of their citizenship , not `` done by germans '' becouse they felt they 're german and by third reich were considered german . 
  i 'm not even sorry , that was their decision . 
  if they 're lying it 's their problem . 
   that they do not know that they are coming here in a legal way ignorantia iuris nocet ( lat . 
  `` ignorance of the law does not excuse '' ) my friend , again , it 's their problem , not mine . 
  they 're criminals , by trying/getting here , it 's against the law and they should be treated as criminals . 
  we should stop saving them . 
  they 're adults , volenti non fit iniuria , they know the risk , they know that they 're coming here in illegal way . 
  if they want be here they should try legal way . 
  we really have a lot of problems and we do n't need more , also we really ca n't afford them , both culturally and economicly . 
  it is not and it wo n't be for russians , both germans and russians have attacked us but germans admitted it and apologised for it while russians 're still playing `` we were libereting you from fascists '' . 
  so yeah , if they behave like animals we should treat them like animals . 
  it 's about time for a change , if we fail i 'm moving to canada :-d, 
  why ? 
  i 'm conservative-libertarian and when i see jobbik gettng power in your country i think of it as very good , healthy and positive thing . 
  of course i 'm afriad of better hungarian-russian relations , but i like how your country is changing . 
  bravo !, 
  speedway almost only in speedway cities like zielona g\u00f3ra , rzesz\u00f3w , leszno etc. 
  his roots are polish , and he considered himself polish too . 
  exactly , they do n't work , they 're like worse greece , it 's only `` gib money '' `` you racist '' `` you wan na buy this ? , very cheap , very cheap , original '', 
  we 've got shrinking population ( 2 + mln people left in last 10 years , mostly young ) and no one cares :d, 
  they 're tartars , if those tartars are as assimilated as `` ours '' we 'll be fine . 
  btw . 
  i know you 're joking . 
  actually to get pole card you have to proove knowledge of polish at certain level . 
  that 's becouse you 're not aplicating for visa to romania but for schengen-visa that 's a little bit different . 
   does your country use the euro ? 
   what do you think of the euro ? 
  there are really different economies in every country to hold 1 currency . 
   how would you like to improve the euro ? 
  just go back to previous currencies . 
   do you think the euro will still be around 20 years ? 
  it might be , but on what cost . 
  edit : i know we ( pl ) have to take euro as our currency but i hope it 'll be in next 200 maybe 300 years :d, 
  [ pole card - wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karta_polaka ), 
  maybe becouse we should take care of our minority in the first place , and someone with polish heritage will assimilate earlier and easier than someone who do n't have polish roots . 
  i 'm not sure if it work like this . 
  interesting fact about poland , in our history as long as we were independent ( that includes middle ages too ) there was no punishment for being gay , or for `` homosexual acts '' , how about that :d [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_poland#history ), 
  we are , most young people believe in `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' and `` as long as i do n't have to see that i 'm okay with it '' . 
  germany is actually very cheap country .
