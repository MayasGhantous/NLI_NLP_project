  it 's not `` very nationalist '' we 're just helping our minority , to get `` pole card '' you have to proove your polish background , i do not see anything wrong with that . 
  after all we beat him , he was murderer and rebel , no one cares . 
  but shitstorm 's coming when ukrainians glorify mass murderer like [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/sbandera.jpg/220px-sbandera.jpg ) and his organisation . 
  edit : i completely understand that you 're young nation and you need your own heroes , but maybe find some non-murder ones . 
  you do n't have to be a citizen of uk to claim benefits there . 
  but claiming benefits is morally wrong , better option is getting a job . 
  decarbonising also will have big influnce in future on our ( european ) industry and at least in poland on electricity prices . 
  poland have one of the biggest resources of coal , it 's cheap energy we should use . 
  mostly becouse jews ( except for warsaw ghetto uprising http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_ghetto_uprising ) pretty much were not fighting : /, 
  well , considering my history , if you wo n't sell us in next 20-30 years , then surely someone will :(, 
  they 'll never pay their debts :(, 
  this time commonwealth of not two , but three nations , lithuanians , ruthenians ( byelorussians ) , poles . 
  that was mistake we made last time  http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plik:coat_of_arms_of_the_january_uprising.svg, 
  love you too our ruthenian brother . 
  yep , but but it did n't worked out for my country so good . 
  but with some time we could 've done something . 
  now we just have to be no ones in middle europe :(, 
  if he was n't catholic lunatic his son might be ruler of russia . 
  but nooo , you wo n't become orthodox , i do n't agree . 
  we could did better things as a country . 
  i love that time too , at least we were the most powerful country in our part of europe . 
  btw . 
  we 're the only european country that actualy not only beat russia but also ruled there :d, 
  actually we had noble republic , it was great but kings were giving too much priviliges to noblemans , veto right were good idea but again realisation of it was n't that good . 
  also feudalism did n't worked out for our economy so well :( for yours nobility it was better , more rights etc. 
  jagiellons were great though . 
  few differences you have not/didn ' t want to see . 
  i 'm legal 2 . 
  i 'm not a criminal ( which all illegals , by definition , are ) 3 . 
  i 'm working very hard , taking overtime , graveshifts etc. 
  i do integrate with society . 
  i 'm paying taxes there . 
  i 'm european , same cultural circle mate , less society problems . 
  i do not play discrimination card, 
  the other governments are putting pressure on poland becouse they 're overwhelmed with illegals . 
  to be honest they 're putting pressure on pretty much every country , but poland is the biggest one , almost clean ( non-poles are 0.3 % of population ) so everyone focus on poland . 
  i 'm not and i 'd like to keep this way , but when i 'm on typical young pole summer break ( cheap white labor in western europe , holidays yay ! ), 
  i am . 
  becouse i do n't make much when i 'm there i have to live in culturally enriched neighbourhood a.k.a. 
  immigrant ghetto and trust me , it is not great . 
  if you 're going to budapest , definitely come to prague , czech republic and to cracow , poland , both are worth seeing and relatively close to budapest . 
  we do n't have to become multicultural again , firstly becouse we never were multicultural , we were multiethnic and this is big difference . 
  secondly look at poles in uk , they have a lot of children . 
  we just need good salary and to get good salary we need true capitalistic economy , not `` social justice '' economy . 
  of course it will take some time , perhaps one generation , but it is still worth it . 
  we have beautiful culture and traditions and i do n't wan na loose that . 
  we also need good law , better police than nowadays . 
  if you want to use this retorics , then ok . yeah , fuck them , becouse it have massive influence on my life , and life of my family . 
  on my culture , on society i live in and for european economy . 
  you need to remember that us is immigrant country and europe is not so it is not a good comparison, 
  belurusians integrated quite well , germans , tartars , silesians too . 
  but ukrainians brutally murdered civilians . 
  so for long time it was really ok . 
  but after all ( depending on source ) 100k-400k polish civilians murdered is not so good . 
  after all ukrainians were problem in multi ethnic poland . 
  generally you 're right , but most of them claim asylum to just live in europe, 
  and remember that catholic church ai n't so bad , i 'm an ( bi ) atheist myself , but i grew up in catholic family , neighborhood , country . 
  and trust me catholic church is quite good , specially comparing to islam . 
  your cultural marxism will lead to decreasing importance of european cultures in europe . 
  i hope you do understand why i 'm worried about this . 
  it 's new eu law , for example if you 're illegal asylum seeker and you put your foot in greece , you have to applicate in greece , if you put your foot on bulgarian soil , you have to applicate in bulgaria . 
  also a lot of middle east migrants goes through turkey , so pretty much first country they can applicate is greece/bulgaria . 
  it does n't opress ** me ** , but if you 're going to third world country you have to respect their culture , but when they 're coming to our countries we have to respect their culture . 
  something clearly is n't right , do n't you think ? 
  that 's sooo true , pls invest in eastern poland :d, 
  look , my country used to be multi-ethnic for centuries , but it did n't actually worked out for us well . 
  [ massacres of poles in volhynia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) . 
  nowadays we 're almost monoethnic , with small minority of ethnic germans , ethnic poles of tartar origin , ethnic silesians ( who are considered polish ) and , for polish standards quite big ukrainian migrants minority . 
  monoethnic societies have way smaller tensions . 
  plus , for anyone who support ** mass ** imigration from third world countries they creating gettos , if you do n't believe me just find * colourful , multi-cultural neighborhood * in your closest big city and live there for 3 months , trust me it is quite difficult chellenge . 
  those animals who abused police officers , should be punished by court . 
  and by animals i mean people from both sides who psychically abused police officers . 
  almost no one seeks asylum in poland , feels good :d, 
   because we want to who are `` we '' ? 
   you , individually , do n't have to do anything . 
  i , individually , am eu citizen and whether i like it , or not like it , it have influence on eu economics , society etc. 
  which also means it have influence on my life . 
   even convicted mass murderers retain basic human rights in good old times mass murderers where hanged , one threat to society less . 
   let alone illegal immigrants . 
  like i mentioned above , i will not , i hope you understand ( or at least try ) my reasons . 
   so you do n't care about human rights as long as you enjoy them ? 
  i did n't really get that , english is my second language . 
  could you make this a little bit more clear to me ? 
  that 's one of our ( eu ) problems , once they on eu soil we ca n't legally immediately deport them . 
  ca n't deport them , ca n't shoot them , ca n't even let them drown . 
  welcome to eu mate . 
  funny fact mate , nazi were not right wing , they were socialists , right wing person ca n't be socialist :d, 
   what a primitive mindset . 
  i 'm not offending you and i 'd like you to do the same . 
   even if they were all adults and all aware of the risk it is basic human dignity to save someone in distress . 
  like i said before , volenti non fit iniuria , they took it as good decision , they 've tried to get here illegally . 
  i do not see why should we help . 
  the only help they deserve , in my opinion , is sending them back if anyone make it . 
   jesus christ you 're sick . 
  that 's your biggest concern of letting people drown ? 
  the inconvenience of their bodies to show up at the beach while you are there ? 
  i do not see them as normal people , but as criminals , becouse crossing border in their way is not legal , i 'm afraid . 
  i have bigger worries than bunch of illegals . 
  they decided to come in illegal way , they may die , i do not care about them as long as i do not have to interact with them in any way , and if they will be deported asap . 
   you sound like the right wing danish people speaking about romanians and polish people living in denmark .
