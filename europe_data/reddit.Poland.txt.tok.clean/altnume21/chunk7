  first of all , both romanians and poles are european christians , wich is important in integration process . 
  secondly most of illegals are `` asylum seekers '' , they ca n't work . 
  most of poles are working , and specially in scandinavia countries they did everything that lokals would n't . 
  the problem is that we have union law that allow illegals to stay if they even touch eu land . 
  you need to remember that those people are adults and they know the risk . 
  `` to a willing person , injury is not done '' ) . 
  it is not our job to `` not let them drown '' . 
  it is their job to not get in small boat with high risk of drowning in first place . 
  of course it is not pleasant to relax on the beach with chances of founding human flesh , but we ca n't afford culturally , socially and financially for more uneducated , completely culturally different immigrants . 
  plus if their get refugee status they can not work , they will be beggars/not paing taxes/creating gettos . 
  do n't care what you are doing with kurds , love ya ' for what you did for us during poland partitions , especially when you were making austrians , prussians and russians crazy with `` o , representative from lachistan did n't arrive '' . 
  look , the plan was of course to create `` living space '' for aryan race , which means slav murdering , but it was never realised . 
  under that circumstances , for pure blood slavs , i mean with non-jewish ancestors , polish citiezens ( polish , silesian , byelarussian , ruthenian , ukrainian ethnicity ) as long as they were not fighting they were treated pretty well comparing to what ussr done to them . 
  russians murdered half of my family from my father side and send rest to siberia , including old people and little kids , the youngest one was only 1 year old . 
  they send them there during winter in cattle wagons , same type that germans used for jews . 
  on the other hand family from my mother side were living in poznan and they were treated well , they hosted german catholic sister and things were well for them . 
  my great grandfather was 1/4 prussian , he did n't sign volksliste and still germans were okay with it . 
  a lot of poles have similar expierience , so i hope you do understand now that we after all we hate more red army than wehrmacht . 
  with better eu border protection ~ 99 %, 
  poland , place where even pegida is not welcome xd, 
   you really call this fat thursday in poland ? 
  yep , `` t\u0142usty czwartek '' - literally `` fat thursday '' . 
  you have to remember of ethnic cleansing of poles in ussr in 1937-38 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_ ( 1937 % e2 % 80 % 9338 ), 
  any polish grandfather/mother , great grandfather/grandmather ? 
  if so , you might obtain pole card , and it would be easier for you to live in poland . 
  they might be refugees in turkey , not in europe . 
  it 's shame that police and media did n't covered this up this time , it might provoke a lot of far - ~ ~ right ~ ~ left violence . 
   generally they will yes , the murder rate here is about 1/4 of what it is in usa . 
  and 30 % higher than in switzerland . 
  failing in getting to uk ? 
  do n't worry , police will protect you , exactly like those christians in ` migrants camp in france , or women during new year eve in western europe and scandinavia , or like during jihadi attack on cafe in paris , or ( ... ) . 
  c'mon , do n't be such xenophobe , killing other becouse of their religion is part of middle eastern culture and heritage . 
  spain is doing well , they just do n't give a fuck about pc and they di what they should do which is protecting their borders . 
  pretty much , but it 's very nice state , richest one of former yugoslavia countries . 
  thanks to it 's small size during one day you can go hitchhiking and then swim in the sea , it 's lovely down there . 
   he 's met a regular mp dude , mr. kaczy\u0144ski is literally unofficial ruler of poland , he has done that nicely and wisely , he 's very intelligent man , do n't get me wrong , but kaczy\u0144ski has a lot of power , unofficially of course . 
  they wo n't stay in romania ( too poor compared to germany ) and wo n't stay in v4 , we wo n't let them . 
  v4 rules !, 
   on your way to become another exportweltmeister ? 
  for that we 'll need 50-70 years , we 're on good way though , it 's good our economy is finally recovering from communism , but becoming significiant world power not just central european one ( which we made in 25years ) just need a lot of time , hard work and weakening others , luckily westernerns are weakening themselves , so yea , we 're on track . 
  yep , last week rating ( pl got a - ) made pln a little bit cheaper , but frankly speaking it 's even better for our export . 
  2015 was first year since 1989 when we exported more than imported , 
  that 's also thanks to our laws , for murder you go to jail for 15 to life , however `` if death of a person is effect of beating , perpetrator will be sentenced for 1 year up to 10 years of jail '' . 
  it 's just `` less risky '' ( i know how it sounds ) to beat guy almost to death and let him die on the street/in hospital that just shot him dead . 
  not exactly , there are black powder revolvers as well , example - https://www.militaria.pl/pedersoli/rewolwer_colt_1861_navy_36_7,5_standard_black_ ( bcru_1861navy36 ) _ kr_p16109 . xml?cat = 318 . 
  you can shoot six times before reloading , and you can easily carry two of them , maybe more . 
  this one costs ~ 1500z\u0142 or as you might prefer slightly less than 350e . 
  why tyskland ? 
  i 'm genuinely interested . 
  he was basically forced to resign . 
  that 's the point , i do n't agree with him , i do n't like his pov , but he has same right to lobby against same sex marriages as i have to lobby for them , better one 'll win . 
  it 's not the reason to made him loose his job . 
  in my country ( poland ) it 's not acceptable , use arguments , lobby and finnally win or loose , but that action looked almost totalitarian, 
   one of the strictest gun control regulations in the world also it 's fully legal to own `` black powder weapon of separate loading ( bullet and black powder separatelly loaded ) produced before 1885 or copy ( replica ) of such '' . 
  you just have to be 18 or older . 
  so if you 're 18 or older you can basically order on the internet weapon ( pistol/rifle ) used in american civil war , quite deadly one . 
   one deviation from the doctrine though ... and you 're done . 
  that 's what we ( former eastern block ) often see looking at northern and western europe . 
  if you meet with swedish democrats you can loose your job , you 're becoming a persona non grata . 
  if you openly oppose to some policies ( like open imigration from 3rd world countries ) you 're not being called `` enemy of the people '' and they do n't send you to gulag , but you 're becoming `` fascist '' `` racist '' `` xenophobe '' and you 're just one more persona non grata or there 'll be one big hate circle about you that might destroy your carreer and even your life . 
  another example ; ( former ) ceo of mozilla , used his own money to support an anti gay marriage organisation . 
  he was basically forced to resign becouse of his point of view . 
  i do not support him , i 'm bisexual myself and same sex marriages are in my interest , but what the hell ?!, 
  where is freedom ?!, 
  are we in this moment when if you oppose left you 're fucked up ? 
  ` couse sure that 's how it looks like from former eastern block countries . 
  pretty much ` couse leftists ruled in central and eastern europe for ~ 50 years . 
  try to imagine that fascists ( like italian ones , not german ones ) are ruling whole western and southern europe for 50 years , it 's not like you would like to live under their rule again . 
  plus commies ( the left ) tried to destroy our identity , our culture and our religion ( part of both culture and traditions ) . 
  i hope i made it quite clear , feel free to ask if you have any questions . 
  you know , we 've got this thing for '' \u0105 , \u0119 , \u0142 , \u017c '' etc. 
  [ gniezno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gniezno ) i guess , first capital of ( then ) duchy of poland , important city of piasts ( first polish dynasty ) , at the begging piasts had just gniezno and local area , but in three generations they conqered almost all area that makes nowadays poland , it 's also first place of first polish bishopric , i think it 's important ` couse catholicism played ( and is still playing ) very important role in our culture , indepence , tradition ( unique `` mix '' pagan and catholic traditions ) . 
  i personally bet germanic languages influence , for example `` clock '' in polish it 's `` zegar '' from german seiger , pretty much elsewhere except for slovenia when they just use german name for clock , `` clock '' came from proto-slavic some kinds of variation of `` godiny/hodiny '' or `` cas '' . 
  old polish was far more similar to what is nowadays slovakian than what is now , it 's just how it evolved . 
  edit : on the other hand why the fuck ca n't eastern and balkan slavs use latin alphabet , it 's way way simpler , especially that all of our languages have different accents ( ok , mine just have \u00f3 / u , rz / \u017c ch/h but people used to prenounced different , now it 's the bloody same ) . 
  all of our languages came from proto-slavic , though some of them had bigger influences of germanic and latin languages than other for example polish and slovenian , it 's sad that all slavic languages do n't share latin alphabet it would make things easier . 
  portugalia in polish , portugalska means ( fem ) portuguese ( as food , buildings , rivers etc. ), 
  you do n't , for example : poland . 
  that 's a big cost , but it 's honourable , we were the only country during wwii that went underground completely , government , army structures etc. 
  we did n't colaborate with germans ( as state ) and most of those few poles who did were sentenced to death for treason by undeground state and executed . 
  it seems to me that they just tryin ' to do all unpopular shit at the beggining of their ruling time . 
  we 're living in democracy and for 4 years from know many people will not remember this . 
  simple mp who happened to be unoficial ruler of poland . 
   africa is n't able to produce enough food to support itself ( or it 's future ) actually it is , look `` rhodesia '' , while white farmers owned land , rhodesia was called `` basket of africa '' since mugambe took office , change country name to zimbambwe and change their economy to shit . 
  country that was once `` basket of africa '' is now a place for humanitarian aid . 
  in zielona g\u00f3ra there 's none too , but luckily in two days there will be like 2c so at least no snow mud . 
  drinking is okay in most of the eu countries , even is you sometimes drink more than you should , but behaving like bloody animals is not acceptable i guess anywhere except uk , especially that most of weekends looks like that . 
  try to count it not as people killed by terrorists but as jihads victims , there is far more jihads victims than crusades victims . 
  i have not , it 's very nice there , great slavic region with lovely tradition of kebab removal . 
  i pointed out balkans as region ( mostly ) outside eu , same as middle east , or far east asia . 
  they were also given special right as non-christians . 
  they could convert their future wifes to islam , they were only non-christians in commonwealth to do so . 
  there were 2 main tatar migrations to grand duchy and kingdom poland . 
  1st were golden horde nobility and their former khan with death sentence ` couse they lost some wars as golden horde and in xiii or xiv century grand duke of lithuania gave them land and honored their noble titles as long as they will considered him their ruler . 
  2nd were some nobility and non-noble tatar warriors who were fighting under commonwealth king and becouse our bugdet was in pretty bad shape king asked them if they will accept their payment in land . 
  kings made them promised they 'll from now on fight for commonwealth and gave them previously mentioned right to spread their faith among their family . 
  tatars are the most committed to polands independence minority , they fought in every uprising for polish independence and from many generations are considered poles and are considering themselves poles ( same as silesians , kashubians , highlanders ) . 
  their culture made quite a big stamp on our culture . 
  our xx century cavalry were named `` u\u0142an '' ( singular ) from tatar `` uhlan '' - `` rider '' . 
   tatar muslim community in lithuania is no different than similar tatar muslim communities in poland , ukraine and belarus .
