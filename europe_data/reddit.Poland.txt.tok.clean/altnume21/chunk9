  the best schools were polish , if you wan na good education you need to speak polish as well as native , good luck with that if your parents speak belarussian or yiddish only . 
  so that 's the moment were minorities finnaly started to speak polish in their homes , at least when they spoked to their kids . 
   kukiz ' 15 ,  a radical right wing populist organization , choose one . 
  is that really a thing in france ? 
  damn , in poland it 's ok to donate blood if you 're not straight , source - i 'm bi and blood donor . 
  also we took so many ukrainians . 
  they did n't came here as fugees , because we obey the law , but they came here as regular workers on limited time visa , there is over 400k ukrainians in poland , it 's about 1 % of our population , about year ago there was about 25k ukrainians in poland . 
  chopin , his music means a lot to me , especially considering history . 
  i do n't blame them , it 's like bavaria 'd like to say goodbye to federation , or silesia in poland , none of us can afford it . 
  we will , but most likely if path is close you 'll have to pay for helicopter ride , also rysy mountain is easy during summer it 's not so easy during winter . 
  that 's mostly becouse ruthenia was part of commonwealth , in plc dominant culutre was polish and for really long time polish was dominant language in diplomatics in this part of europe . 
  slavic languges are easy for slavs , not for others and polish is the most difficult slavic language . 
  somehow lithuanians used it for really long time . 
  we can leave lw\u00f3w claim , just stop calling murderers from upa `` national heroes '' . 
  it 's ok , polish language is n't the easiest one . 
  good for you , so bad your country is traitor , who betrayed us 3 times during one war . 
  it 's actually one word , rzeczpospolita , not like res publica in latin . 
   back preu\u00dfen . 
  funny that land stealer want something he stole . 
  yeah , it is look at our long friendship , they did n't destroyed our country 2 times in 150 years . 
  the way you treat polish ethnic minority says something different ... 
  it doeas n't matter if it 's reapted on purpose or not , still `` a lie repated a thousand times becomes a truth '' and we ca n't allow it . 
  yeah , but traditionally ( a term that might be unknown in the us due to it 's long history ) left wing wears red , at least in europe , and guess what it 's r/europe . 
  i 'd rather not let people ( even those not smart ) think that poland stand behind sloughter of 20 % of it 's citizens ( poles , gypsies , jews ) germans done that , not poles . 
   a lie repeated a thousand times becomes the truth ~ joseph goebbels `` polish death camps '' , so called `` mistakes '' are uneceptable , and should be explained and matter of apologies not excuses , do n't blame the victim even quite sublimal . 
  that 's all i have to say ` bout `` polish death camps '' . 
  yeah , but as genuine master of propaganda , goebells said `` a lie repeated a thousand times becomes the truth '' so please do n't repeat the lie . 
   poland is not the victim , but the perpetrator of the holocaust . 
  thank you for that . 
  is n't he a socialist ? 
  by socialist i mean what he does not what he says . 
  yeah , i agree it 's shorter , however `` a german nazi-camp on occupied polish territory '' is not right either , you know almost all camps on polish soil were built on territory considered reich , not generalgouvernement f\u00fcr die besetzten polnischen gebiete , that 's first , secondly , it 's shorter when you call them `` german camps '' ` couse they where built by germans ( austrains , prussians , saxonians etc. ), 
  to exterminate `` subhumans '' - slavs , gypsies , jews . 
  for me calling them `` polish '' it 's like calling them `` jewish camps '' , ` couse a lot of jews ( or more or less poles of jewish origin ) died there , those `` jewish death camps '' sounds good when someone write ` bout your death camps ? 
  i do n't think so , however you use `` lazy writing '' as an excuse , which is completely unexcaptable . 
  on the one hand it 's sad ` couse he 's president of the most powerful country'tm , on the other hand he 's red , so you ca n't expect a lot . 
  you know brother , it 's not used by common folks , it 's used by western media and it 's completely not fair to blame victim for crime , it 's like blaming women for being raped , it 's not midle east , yet some people are doing it , maybe ` couse of ignorance , maybe on purpose ... 
  you know , it happens all the time in western media , accedently calling your death camps `` polish '' becouse `` oooh , they are in loceted in poland , soo you know ... '' [ how often `` polish death camps '' were used in media , use google translete to translate country names ] ( http://niepozwalam.pl/niemieckie-obozy-smierci ), 
  yeah , you know , orders from moscow , orders from brussels , orders from berlin it 's not like we got used to it and we do n't give a single !, 
  @ $ % about it . 
   but we are not losing poland because it is not in the euro yet . 
  poland wo n't join eurozone , at least not in next 20-30 years . 
  there are politicians who 'd like to join eurozone but their support ( depending on a poll ) is something like 5-10 % . 
  for me , it 's not so good idea to join it , mostly becouse `` euro '' as a currency is not economical but purely political project and it 's pretty much nothing good for us . 
  why should we ? 
  last time i checked there was no law that says we should, 
  in my dorm complex ( 600 people ) there are about 30-40 vietnamese students . 
  nice students , we had poland vs vietnam football game like 2 weeks ago . 
  i have n't heard of any `` racist '' accidents against them though it 's in quite small ( 120k ) , conservative city . 
  there was no such thing as `` ukrainian '' 180 years ago , belarusians were considered just an ethnic group , small and weak . 
  estonians and finns were too weak and too small as well . 
  however poles were big nation , living in very important area . 
  thugs got those turks , they can beat you ` couse you 're tall , short , fat , skinny , blonde , brown hair , they were just looking for a fight . 
  people like that live in every country . 
   and what happened to polish-turkish friendship ? 
  should i remind you that ottomans never acknowledged partitions and famous phrase `` where is the deputy from lehistan '' . 
  it 's not like russia influence on black sea grew at that time and turks were doing everything they could to win black sea geopolitics ? 
  we ca n't talk ` bout any friendship mate , turks were playing `` lehistan card '' , becouse it was wise decision , they needed poland , or at least us revolting to make russia weaker not becouse they felt so bad for us not having our country . 
  you know , one leader , one opinion , one reich ... 
  yeah , what i do n't get is why they are considering civilians murderer and terrorist a `` national hero '' . 
  when it comes to polish if you know some basic russian words it wo n't be too bad , hard to say ` bout czech . 
  it 's cheaper but the view is worth your time and money . 
   well , they certainly did n't burn the flag before the movie was released and lower number of pirates coused [ global warming ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/piratesvstemp ( en ) . svg/2000px-piratesvstemp ( en ) . svg.png ) . 
   sure , making a genocidal criminal a national hero is n't exactly a nice thing to do but then again , it 's not the first country to ever have done so . 
  in fact , it 's common place even now . 
  vladimir lazarevic who was a convicted war criminal after the war in yugoslavia is considered a national hero in serbia first of all making genocidal guys `` heroes '' is not nice . 
  secondly using '' [ and you are lynching negroes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) '' kind of argument is just wrong in a discussion . 
  thirdly we 're trying to help ukraine and they 're making people who were murdering poles simply for being poles national heroes of ukraine , people are pissed . 
  i bet making upa , guys who committed genocide in galicia-volhynia , heroes of ukraine is what pissed them of . 
  economicly he was doing great but he forgot about the people , his party became too arrogant . 
  pretty much that 's what would happen . 
  our ruling party ( pis ) got 37,58 and 236 out of 460 mps and we have proportional system . 
  your politics might be difficult to understand by westerners , but for someone who lives in post-communist country they are not . 
  it still counts . 
  chinese are ambitious ones , we will be satisfied with ural mountains/s, 
  do n't worry , we have almost the same law here . 
  add to that tatar-ottoman slave trade , slaves were abducted people of polish lithuanian commonwealth , the longest slave trade was arab slave trade , but hey , they aint europeans . 
  what 's important when it comes to slave trade europeans were first to end it and why the hell no one care to mention role of african tribes , they were the ones selling slaves to europeans/jews/arabs . 
  there are very few people left who speak like that , most of them if not all of them are old people from kresy region ( former eastern poland , nowadays southern lithuania , western belarus , western ukraine ) who grew up in places with significant eastern slavs minority . 
  over 50 % of the world use that notation . 
  the most messed up version is us notation , mm/dd/yy makes absolutely no sense , but they 're the one with imperial system ... 
  it 's early november , so most likely snow + rain . 
  i guess you 're right , but that 's something i can live with , it 's tradition and just some waste . 
  of course not , slav cemeteries were first human made objects visible from space/s, 
  it 's mostly glass and plastic all of that can be recycled . 
  politics in post about all saints day celebration in poland ...  charity biggest charity organisation in poland is caritas , catholic organisation . 
   brotherly love i bet you 're trying to talk about immigrants from mena countries , well , they 're perceived as nothing good here , but we want to help and we do help refugees , not migrants in refugee camps in syria and lebanon . 
  they 're perceived as threat to our people and we have full right to say `` hey !, 
  ya aint commin ' to our country '' . 
  as for christianity , in bible , luke 22 36-38 , jesus said to group of his apostles that 2 swords are enough , those words are interpreted by catholic church as `` you have right to defence '' , ` couse surely 2 swords for group of guys aint enough to attack somebody and not lettin ' people perceived as threat go to your country surely is defence . 
  i 'm atheist btw . 
  but if you wan na talk about christianity , christian traditions etc. 
  just pm me , i believe i know that religion quite well . 
  edit : spelling, 
  [ meanwhile in lithuania ] ( http://www.accuweather.com/en/lt/vilnius/231459/weather-forecast/231459 ), 
  it is not , at least in my part of country ( western poland ) . 
  that 's so true . 
   unfortunately , it 's not possible to edit titles after they have been submitted . 
  looks like it 'll stay . 
  definitely not a typo , i was convinced that `` cementary '' not `` cemetery '' is right spelling .
