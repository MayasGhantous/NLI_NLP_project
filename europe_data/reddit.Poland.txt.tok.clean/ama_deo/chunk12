   can you properly translate this part ? 
  i ca n't translate it in 100 % , because this is written in formal language . 
  parliament in the second `` readings '' voetd by 82 people of 141 people in parliament adopted the projecton thursday , however against will of poles and reported by the conservative opposition party fixes that removed provision on the possibility of using bilingual signs with the names of streets and places . 
  mostly poland in 99 % of `` actions '' . 
  street names were n't incorporated to lithuanian law before . 
  that means they were n't legal or illegal . 
  now they are , because your government said so . 
  lithuanian government forgot that only country who protect their air-zone is poland . 
  i 'm for that . 
  unfortunately lithuania does n't offer anything to native polish minority there . 
  that 's very very sad . 
  [ area should be marked there it 's not very hard to distinguish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_lithuania ) on the other hand russian population is a lot smaller and is in diaspora , so there should not be billingual street names . 
  in fact russian minority came to lithuania in xx century . 
  poles are native population of those lands and they did n't came to lithuania . 
  they live there over 500 years . 
  so ... polish and russian minority are completely other things . 
   i think it would be nice to have some polish language street signs in areas where polish-speaking [ there are for lithuanians in pl ] ( http://duolook.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/punsk-punskas-litweskie-miasteczko-w-polsce.jpg ) in fact lithuanian minority in poland contains only 7,9 k people !!!, 
  compare that with polish minority in lithuania . 
  that 's not shocking , that is sad . 
  those things are happening in lithuania very often , so it 's not very shocking . 
  poles were discriminated there since ever . 
  we need to stop that . 
  eu will help us ( i hope ), 
  not really , they were n't legal or illegal . 
  now it 's illegal . 
  and that 's is big problem for discriminated and persectued polish minority . 
  lithuania once again confirmed poland you are still eastern european . 
  we need european commision to solve that problem . 
  that 's domestic information for poland and lithuania only . 
  do you expet this in cnn ?

  zone of civil war, 
  russian separatists did it . 
  my question is ... how the plane can legally fly through a war zone ? 
  since 1991 . who is the boss now ? 
  noone , because political program of jkm doean not include monarchy . 
  he said that the best system is monarchy like in liechtenstein . 
  his political program does not include changing system into monarchy . 
  i do n't support him , but please do n't spread bullshit . 
  most of young people are tired of our political system , bureaucracy and corruption not just illegal weed . 
  jkm is only alternative . 
  americans call it chechnya , you know, 
  i hope that will change something . 
  we 're looking forward !, 
  congratulations for the winners !, 
  i supported argentina though , they lost many chances to win . 
  there is something called border . 
  i see you are taliking non stop about onion and socks . 
  that 's not even funny , that 's pathetic, 
  * bigger support for local companies ( lower taxes etc. ), 
  * more economical freedom in terms of doing buisness and starting new * less beurocracy * less voivodeships * simplified clear law * less ministries * opening borders with belarus and ukraine * better patent law, 
  i usually avoid reposting to troll . 
  but when i realised you 're portugesese i can only say : prepare yourself to beg on french streets . 
   beings of immense retardedness , wearing tracksuits and sandals + socks , at the same time . 
  is that description of you ? 
  he 's polish, 
  we have some joke in poland . 
  what is the best way to pick up a girl ? 
  tell her `` i 'm from erasmus '', 
  some sort of stupid conversation, 
  then only america and china counts . 
   slavic germans wtf is that ? 
  `` poland can not into space '' joke does n't even makes sense now . 
  because poland `` was into space '' in 1978 . 
  i believe 90 % of joking people know this . 
  [ poland had a 646.38 metres tall mast until someone fucked up ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_radio_mast ) . 
  it was the world 's tallest structure until collapse . 
  ( copypaste from lared930 ), 
  the truth is ( or might be ) that if not lukashenko and his reforms belarus would end like ukraine ( economically ), 
  belarus had huge recession before lukashenko 's election . 
  in 1995 belarus had economic growth and never had recession again . 
  not every uneplyoed is also registered in poland and lithuania . 
  i believe real unemplyoment rate in belarus is 4-5 %, 
  out of my 100 ( or more ) comments i joked once and you are calling me nazi and even antisemite xd, 
  i love how you like to present lithuania as a great country while belarus as a north korea . 
  it is n't even connected to truth . 
  belarus is normal country . 
  not different than any post-communist country in exception of that people chosed leader and they believe in him + they are very pro-russian . 
  [ poor minsk ] ( http://s019.radikal.ru/i618/1205/ce/d8b21228a410.jpg ) [ center of vilnius , lithuania ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@54.698232,25.277255,3a,75y,81.44h,79.37t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sboa1wg9psbrkbfjtawclja!2e0?hl=pl ) [ old town ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@54.681155,25.299953,3a,75y,90.92h,89.55t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1smh3muosowl4g38jwr_ihsw!2e0?hl=pl ) yeah poor dictatorship belarus . 
  people are starving etc. 
  but lithuania great lithuania european and second of all it is funny you calling me `` polish hater '' if i was french you would call me `` french hater '' ? 
  [ picture from grodno ] ( http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/58/a7/99/grodno.jpg ) edit : what kind of post have you seen ? 
  well , it depends . 
  i was shocked in a positive way . 
  belarus is not communist poor country like many people love to present . 
  i strongly recommend . 
  you will change your opinion about belarus . 
  have you been there ? 
   belarussian gdp is almost stagnating belarus gdp growth 5.5 % ( 2011 ) 1.5 % ( 2012 est. ), 
  2.1 % ( 2013 ) belarus has also 0,5 % of unemplyoed while in lithuania is 12,4 %  the oligarchy can afford that stuff and they afford going here it looks like propaganda . 
  that 's of course not true . 
  the regular people are comming there in big amount , they are as rich or even richer than lithuanians and it has nothing to do with party . 
  lukashenka said that those people who are comming there are `` parasites '' so how it can be connected to party ? 
  i 've been to belarus and lithuania . 
  vilnius is the city with many neglected buildings , blocks , and bad roads and dirty even if lithuania gathers biggest amount of money from eu . 
  minsk and grodno are clean and neat cities , there are no holes in roads . 
  buildings are good everything is renovated , people have good cars etc. 
  + minsk metro and tranms are great and modern . 
  people are buying in lithuania and poland because of inflation . 
  but belarusians are n't poor they have good cars .
