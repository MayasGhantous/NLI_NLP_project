  it 's getting more and more pathetic . 
  more likely germany elected himself . 
  according to google translate both means the same, 
  i mentioned this before you commented . 
  biega\u0107 does n't mean `` to flee '' uciec means that . 
  go to google translate : more precisely it should be : b\u0117gti / b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c / uciec, 
   b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c those are basically the same words related to east slavic , more than to anything . 
  and if you are doing shitstorm and manipulation over one word , then i must quit is discussion very fast . 
   my comment : what east slavic languages have the word `` b\u0113gt '' ? 
  your answer : russian `` bezhat '' latvian `` b\u0113gt '' lithuanian `` b\u0117gti '' polish `` uciec '' czech `` uprchnout '' all of those words mean `` to flee '' are you a funny manipulator do n't you ? 
   latvian and lithuanian are n't east slavic languages . 
  you should educate yourself . 
  and then is my response :  ** who said that ? 
  ** latvian and lithuanian are part of baltoslavic branch , which consists of all slavic languages and baltic . 
  once again . . who said that latvian and lithuanian are east slavic ? 
  i provided you a link explaining you that they are balto-slavic , which have similarities with east slavic , as you could see in the example i wrote . 
  before you will start manipulating once more , start to read properly . 
  thank you !, 
  wtf ? 
  what are you even trying to convince me to ? 
  ca n't you get simple facts , which i provided you in wikipedia , instead you are giving me graphic from the same link ? 
  seriously . 
  not only you ca n't read , but also you are giving me link about the same , while saying something different . 
  once more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages do you really read what you write ? 
  do you really think when reading ? 
  ca n't you read what i wrote ? 
  seriously . 
  once more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages, 
  thanks for corretion , 
   latvian and lithuanian are n't east slavic languages . 
  you should educate yourself . 
  who said that ? 
  latvian and lithuanian are part of baltoslavic branch , which consists of all slavic languages and baltic . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages as you see . 
  they are similar to east-slavic languages i 'll remind you once more : russian `` bezhat '' latvian `` b\u0113gt '' lithuanian `` b\u0117gti '' polish `` uciec '', 
  you 're wrong . 
  to flee `` uprchnout '' - czech `` uciec '' - polish, 
   it 's probably same in all slavic languages . 
  russian `` bezhat '' latvian `` b\u0113gt '' lithuanian `` b\u0117gti '' polish `` uciec '' czech `` uprchnout '' all of those words mean `` to flee '', 
  in polish it 's uchod\u017aca for refugee . 
  however uciekinier is for deserter , from uciekanie `` fleeing '' , the word deserter have negative meaning but `` fleeing from war '' is often used for refugees and it has no negative meaning . 
  i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is more common for east slavic languages . 
   `` b\u0113gt '' - to flee in polish `` biega\u0107 '' - to run . 
  interesting similarity . 
  ssa\u0107 in polish means `` to suck '' ssak - `` someone/something who suck '', 
  well apparently we have the easiest word for that . 
  ssak it . 
  you 're too late there was nothing there from 2 hours . 
  my grandfather died in auschwitz , he fell out of a tower . 
  passing right into both of your towers . 
  there is like 3000 km from perth to singapore . 
   australia is possibly the worst country in the world to live in if you want to travel and explore new zealand , japan , singapore , bali , thailand , china . 
  indeed worst ... 
  i was joking, 
  but it apparently does n't have a good chocolate and guns . 
  australia is much better . 
  they have more sane laws . 
  more freedom , more radical immigration policy ( which is good ) and good climate . 
  living in australia you can travel to many exotic places and live in a very developed country . 
  and it 's also cheaper . 
   there is no country good enough to live in in europe we both have different definitions of live . 
  for ones vegetation is enough , others want to travel explore , and having 100 % happiness from life . 
  no european country yet provides that . 
  australia above all !, 
  did you ever been outside of europe ? 
   what do you think is the best european country to live in ? 
  australia , there is no european country enough good to live in . 
  but if we talk about only european countries it might be iceland - quiet , safe , without stupid laws and bureaucracy and with strong economic recovery . 
  til according to your logic alexander the great was macedonian . 
   and even lviv/lw \u00f3w was n't 90 % polish yes , it was for 90 % of time from it 's foundation with a large jewish minority . 
   while great duchy of lithuania conquered other southern ruthenian principalities ( 14th century ) . 
  well , not grand duchy of lithuania was made after mongol invasion destroyed kievan rus , which gave the opportunity for random duchies to unify to rebuild the structures of a statehood . 
  that 's why they created grand duchy , which was made of several smaller duchies . 
   most of this lands were inhabited by poles yes , such cities like lw\u00f3w , kij\u00f3w were 90 % polish . 
  even the smaller towns and villages which were properties of a nobility had mostly polish-speaking population . 
  i 'm talking about all lands that are now in ukraine . 
  even those who are ukrainian since 1945 . 
  sure , but i 'm a fan of history ;p, 
  i think there was never such thing as ukraine before and it 's name delivers from polish name of borderlands . 
  i think the word `` occupation '' is pure nonsense , poland never invaded ukraine , because it did n't exist and most of this lands were inhabited by poles . 
  when poland was strong , germans was too scared to attack and poland was not interested in conquering them . 
  when poland was weak germans suddenly had an opportunity to grab our land . 
  i see a pattern here . 
  deluge was part of great northern war , which was disasterous for sweden . 
  sweden officially surrendered and promised to give back all stolen things . 
  but they did n't . 
  i always thought wings gave them more stability when charging . 
  dude , he 's right . 
  swedes not only fought against regular armies , but burned , slaughtered entire cities , robbed all valuable things , gold , arts , etc. 
  it 's estimated that 30 % of poland died as a result of swedish invasion . 
  poles won and sweden was destroyed economically and military , but the results overall were tragic . 
  today , many of polish things are in swedish museums . 
  interestingly all of those battles except vienna were fought in modern day ukraine . 
   tartars were muslim [ did n't know the dental plaques believed in allah .

  yes , finally an article unrelated to islamic immigrants . 
  my upvote . 
   nobility in commonwealth was about 10 % of population , highest percentage in europe , comparable only to spain still a marginal portion of a majority of population . 
  and the nobility lived in all parts of the commonwealth , not in one place as you suggest . 
   big cities had higher percentage of nobility than countryside true , but many nobles had their mansions and their private villages far away from big cities .
