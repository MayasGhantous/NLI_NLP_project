  does n't matter if tourist or immigrant . 
  modern lithuanian is a completely different language . 
   polish lithuanian commonwealth was not lithuanian country ? 
  `` the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth , formally the kingdom of poland and the grand duchy of lithuania ( also known as the kingdom of poland , or just poland [ 4 ] ) '' `` western europeans often simply called it poland , applying the pars pro toto synecdoche . 
  the widespread term commonwealth of both nations ( polish : rzeczpospolita obojga narod\u00f3w ) was coined in the 20th century and is rarely used '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth, 
  you know that is bullshit ? 
  lithuania had relatively insignificant power in the commonwealth and was treated mainly like a province . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth was n't a lithuanian country , so it ca n't be classified as a `` rise time '' of balts . 
  modern lithuanian was n't even a language in the former grand duchy . 
  do you know that grand duchy lithuania and modern lithuania are completely different countries unrelated to each other ? 
  i hope you do . 
  [ eastern europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/eastern-europe-map2.svg/800px-eastern-europe-map2.svg.png ), 
  i know that baltic tribes migrated through history . 
  but having a very early middle ages or iron age as your `` time of rise '' is pretty lame in my opinion . 
  lithuanians never had a state until 1918 and so they were dominated by foreign nation since ever . 
  i will never understand your phenomenon of your overly pride , like being pride of being a last christianized territory in europe . 
  first , that 's incorrect . 
  balts never inhabited dnieper basin , however they inhabited sambia , territory of todays kaliningrad oblast . 
  which is is barely a thing to be called a great rise . 
  baltic people were always dominated by other people , and culturally and historically related to slavs , as they have in language similarities . 
  finally , yes i 'm sometimes mad at you , but is this a really bad thing ? 
  i doubt all of my not so sophisticated words about you are worse , than what our people had witness being part of your republic . 
  so do azerbaijan . 
  balts never rise at all to begin with . 
  i personally have nothing against being called eastern european, 
  eastern europe = balkans ( with greece , because greece is balkan ) + ukraine + belarus + baltics, 
  yes slovenia , join central europe . 
  we welcome you . 
  `` classic balkans '' ... you guys are silly, 
  chevrolet ? 
  wow canada is so high !, 
  what cars are they producing ? 
  actually no , people shit about eastern poland being so poor , but i never notice any decaying cities or houses there , also thanks for informing . 
  i would never come up that is connected to the former sudetenland . 
  prague is actually a very good city , unfortunately the more you are going to the borderlands of czech republic the country is starting to look as some 3rd world . 
  with places so bad , i never seen something similar in my country . 
  i 'm saying it as a former hitchhiker . 
  prague is a very exceptional city though . 
  poland is of glorious commonwealth . 
  1610 best year of my lief !, 
  prussia , there is no prussians , and they never been lithuanians . 
  there is no lithuanian minority in suwalki , maybe if you meant truck drivers . 
  `` yatviag land '' wtf is dat, 
  estonia is part of russia, 
  are you picking random polish cities ? 
  litwa you are so clever !, 
  i love you litwa . 
  drink kompot with me . 
  greenland is part of denmark, 
  `` godless triators '' better than `` posh americans '' huh ? 
  he try to convince people estonia into nordic, 
  life was strange in medievals, 
   dirty nordics * yeah , dirty sweden , norway , finland , denmark and iceland, 
  do n't need to remind that most of our prostitutes comes from a poor countries like russia , bulgaria , latvia or lithuania . 
  and so the `` latvian girl '' became a very suspicious term . 
  i 'm not mad , i 'm just pointing a nonsense, 
  also you have prostitutes on our roads which become a viral stereotype , maybe just before bulgarian ones . 
  basically everything bad comes from russia , ukraine or lithuania ( with latvia ) generally you have a fucked up reputation here . 
  you are n't very good at stats do n't you ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_unemployment_rate etc. 
  also you 're gdp per capita is only a little bit higher , only because half of your people are abroad , otherwise it would be much , much lower . 
  latvians are associated with lithuanians ( and rest of baltics ) sharing some stereotypes of russians . 
  * lorry drivers , often driving very bad , or while being drunk , also known as cancer of our roads . 
  * car thieves , or lorry drivers who like to steal stuff in filling stations * poor, 
  you do n't know any ? 
  we have even stereotypes about them . 
  yes , latvia can into relevancy . 
   kulvietis 's lithuanian , best lithuanian . 
  [ ruski lithuanian , best lithuanian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/biblia_ruska.jpg ), 
  sweden yes !, 
  we 're the best at being always in the middle . 
  this video is 1 year old . 
  it 's hardly `` meanwhile '' video . 
  also , you 're right . 
  police in poland does n't use tasers . 
  oh god this is so old !, 
  madagascar stronk and independent !, 
  you see ? 
  you see ? 
  we are commonwealth anyways . 
  but never forget the deluge . 
  sure , lithuanians would finally speak lithuanian . 
  [ and the overlook of novidrag is based on the old town of gdansk ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=novigrad+gdansk&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cacq_auoamovchmig6vvjeofxw ), 
  but want into commonwealth, 
  `` te '' means `` these '' in polish ( feminine ), 
  implying there is someone speaking actual belarussian, 
  and do you know that for ukrainians learning polish is easier than german ? 
  multiple poles chose uk over norway ... why are you so ignorant ? 
   three mln of ukrainians want to go to work abroad , first to poland , germany and italy do you know what is the difference between wanting to go to work and actual reality ? 
  do you know that in the same survey half of poles want to move abroad ? 
  so the actual 8 % is a good number , nothing to be scared about . 
  fun fact : these letters were used as a writing script in the witcher 3, 
  they tried to conquer us multiple times , but they failed . 
  that 's why we are `` passion land '' or that 's how i understand it . 
  i do n't think there is much difference between czech and slovak , maybe some letters in words , just all . 
  but it 's different than czech or slovak . 
  yeah , they are very educational . 
  i wish there was more of it . 
  are n't silesians saying `` syr '' instead of ser ? 
  polish is a very unique type of slavic language .
