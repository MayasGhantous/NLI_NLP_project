  for me understanding czech and slovakian is far more easier , since we are west slavs and you are east . 
  i also miss krak\u00f3w , even though i 'm polish . 
  i love to driving there . 
  poland borders with russia, 
  why they did n't ? 
  guys . . 22 years ? 
  why there 's so big corruption in romania ? 
  there 's always some news about someone getting arrested for bribery . 
  i 'm not saying that eu is a devil , but over 70 % of poland do n't support joining eurozone and we should respect that . 
  why no love for z\u0142oty ? 
  how about no ? 
  what you gon na do now ? 
  poland payed price for being in the eu , why do we need a monetary union dictated from germany if euro is among the trashiest currencies and 1 euro soon will be worth less than 1 dollar ? 
  eu countries have right to delay introducing euro . 
  basically you can claim that you wil use it in 2222 and when it 's 2222 you can say 2500 and that 's not against the agreement . 
  a lot of countries use this technique, 
  why do we need to adopt euro if most of people are against it and we do n't really see the advantages of it ? 
  hong kong was n't european before 1997 . 
  whut ? 
  3 years for smuggling a person ? 
  are we insane ? 
  those harsh border control laws ... 
  greenland is not in europe ... 
  is this guy singing sami ? 
  he looks like, 
  yeah esperanto is cool . 
  it looks very similar to romanian , though it 's poilish invention . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  dresden is actually drezno, 
   zenon jankowski yep , sadly also there 's interesting story about hermaszewski  he is a survivor of the volhynian massacres during which ukrainian nationalists murdered 19 members of his family , including his father . 
  hermaszewski narrowly escaped death himself when the ukrainian insurgent army attacked lipniki on the night of 26 -- 27 march 1943 . 
  in polish wikipedia he 's presented as a one who survived the massacre as a toddler . 
  he was found lying on the snow , while covered . 
  so generally that man had a lot of luck , seriously . 
  it 's because of mass-media . 
  unfortunately there are dozen of gangs from romania who steal and kidnapping . 
  they are presented as romanian citizens due to `` political correctnes '' . 
  they wo n't just say they are gypsies . 
  yay !, 
  we welcome romanians to change those stereotypes about your country in poland . 
  i like that comment under this video . 
   romania : here is our chance to break stereotypes of our country !, 
  sends gypsy vampire warlock well done romania . 
  miros\u0142aw hermaszewski went into space = poland can into space . 
  not in internetz though . 
  no one inteligent would die for the government . 
  maybe , idk, 
  in polish - owca . 
  learn polish with ama_deo ^ ^ tm, 
  i understand part of it , that is not enough for understanding whole text . 
  `` wiwzi '' that 's sounds funny, 
  i do n't unterstand ;(, 
  yup , that 's actually interesting . 
  when i wrote that people in ukraine should n't fight for corrupt politicians , that british soldiers shoudl n't go to ukraine . 
  i got a lot of downvotes and i was called `` pussy '' and `` putinbot '', 
  our government is pretty stupid . 
  they do n't understand that not everyone loves army and want to die to defend homeland and your home . 
  i 'm pretty young i want to die peacefully as a grandpa . 
  a lot of people would agree with me . 
  nah , never say that . 
  or at least not serious . 
  wilno can stay being governed by republic of lithuania . 
  ^ ^ to ^ ^ 2016 ^ ^ xd, 
  yeah , yeah . 
  i 'm actually proud that i want to defend my life and i do n't want , poland to forcibly take my life , because of politician 's decisions . 
  war is only between politicians . 
  i would n't die for it if i have my life in front of me . 
  politicians would be the first one to flee from poland , like rats and the regular people would be used as a cannon fodder . 
  i think that 90 % of poland would escape too . 
  only idiots who think that they would change something who go to army and fight . 
  our goverment is using us as a weapon to defend their interests . 
  not me though . 
  i would run away . 
  you 're turkish , you 're born in germany . 
  everything is according to plan, 
  poland : [ hel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hel,_poland ) close enough, 
  imho if war would happen i would immediately run away from poland . 
  i do n't want to die for ukraine . 
  sorry guys . 
  yeah i will be downvoted . 
  so do i, 
  omg , that looks really ... bad, 
  i 'm tired of those `` iq maps '' or `` iq stats '' where everyone gets different scores . 
  1945 best year . 
  take that . 
  it does n't make sense . 
  germany 's debt is 80 % of gdp while russian or estonian is olny few %, 
  and russia, 
  neuschwanstein is not a really a castle and in my opinion is an architectural failure . 
  the building was build in xix century to remind medieval castle , but instead they did something that was quasi-medieval castle made in china . 
  i love architecture in england . 
  everything seems to be like for harry potter movie . 
  so mysterious and magical , also a bit terrifying, 
  definitely the best one . 
  the location is incredible, 
  [ lithuanian invasion of wilno ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/celebrations_of_vilnius_return_to_lithuania_near_vilnius_cathedral_in_1939.jpg ) was done in 1939 before nazi invasion and after agreement with soviet union of allowing using lithuanian railway for soviet military . 
  soviet union used this during soviet invasion of poland in 17th september 1939 occupying half of poland except wilno region which was invaded by lithuania ( just as the agreement ), 
  poland stronk !, 
  ireland we anschluss yuo !, 
  gib clay,
