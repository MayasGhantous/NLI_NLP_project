polish `` chrup '' is only when something is crunchy . 
  otherwise it would be `` mniam '' . 
  yep , just this morning . 
  it accounts for the distortion , great for comparisions . 
  he got 'em like eminem in 8 mile . 
  fucking duolingo and its highly useful sentences . 
  judging from google street-view it 's forests and dirt roads . 
  warsaw has a nice skyline aside from the palace of culture too . 
  so i guess they 'll need to shoot it down . 
  they are too lazy for crime . 
  so , polish ** zadupie ** - behind ass, 
  kachkodziob , kachkanos , ptakopysk , these sound incredibly funny for my polish self . 
  in example we have 4 apple trees , 2 plums , walnut tree , cherry , sweet cherry and we had apricot . 
  we have two small belts of ground for vegetables , some cucumbers , sorrel , dill , used to have carrots , and few bushes of strawberries . 
  this is not much , just two stripes when in example my neighbours on one side have all their backyard in vegetables there where we have grass . 
  yes , most of people have some trees/fruits/vegetables where i live . 
  alternatively `` forest '' . 
  `` rains '', 
  poland comes from word `` pole '' which mean field . 
  field , or fields , would be very alike others in asoiaf . 
  the will to reproduce though . 
  as much as we like to complain , we are the local power in the central-east europe . 
  send us your women !, 
  from the internet , and i often meet with this here . 
  because it swore to do so . 
  there 's a song , `` green ireland '' , maybe that 's why . 
  well , we also have this about bia\u0142ystok . 
  but the legend explains that . 
  slovenia is now availible on google street-view . 
  we were saying exactly the same 10 years ago . 
  and well . . it 's happening . 
  i do n't think so , linguistically it 's clearly romance , almost italian , not similar to in example polish at all . 
  moldova is probably the country in europe i know the least about , that 's nice to see it here and in such an atmosphere , cause i always have sad images in my had when thinking about the country that i mostly hear reffered to as the poorest country in europe . 
  americans maybe, 
  but norways is sparsely populated and most of the country are mountains and not inhabited regions so number of highways does n't say much . 
  [ that 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnly_6ximki ) national road nr 1 , [ that one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp8kv7yrzsm ) has status of a voivodeship road , i can [ multiply ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5a7rtjar3u ) the examples , [ that 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qc2tbj-wgm ) what you see everyday in poland , in city or on route . 
  only countries with worse roads in europe according to statistics are countries like ukraine , belarus or romania . 
  sorry mate but i 'm sure roads in norway are in much better condition . 
  not convinced . 
  [ oh yeah , feel that ] ( http://czujesz.to/pdata/t/12575.jpg ) . 
  although there are more and more [ new trains ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ir1kk2q ) and they are much nicer . 
  uhm , with potholes . . ? 
  i doubt it . 
  i ca n't hear you while driving this road full of holes . 
  well , according to many it 's not we 're homophobic , but the western world is trying to push a ` homopropaganda ' which glorifies homosexuals to the level of gods . 
  and girls can play with guns too . 
  it may be deeply satisfying . 
  * slavs, 
  i 'd never guessed that jab\u0142ko is related to apple , or pomara\u0144cza - pomme orange , and even herbata , herba thea . 
  interesting . 
  funny how it changed , i 'd never guessed . 
  southern neighbours . 
  mostly mountaneous , they have the rest of the tatras . 
  probably the most similar language to polish . 
  some other obvious stuff like capital and bit of history that 's mentioned all over . 
  nice mr satan . 
  but eu needs a new market to sell old shit, 
  ukraine is game to you ? 
  there are some armenians where i live . 
  i guess that 's because bad situation in their country . 
  they are mostly dark skinned , often confused with gypsies . 
  they do n't have the best opinon amongst the people . 
  what i know about the country itself is that it is a rather poor country with capital in yerevan , i know where it lies on the map . 
  it 's not a country of my interest . 
  i personally would n't say it lies within europe . 
  hopefully i will know a bit more after reading this thread . 
  * hug * ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ shoot, 
  on the other hand , my grandfather was disguisted that english people wear long johns in public :d ( he meant leggins and similar ) . 
  yep , it 's funny cause actually twitter in poland is only politics , journalists and beiber lovers . 
  small town that people only know about because it 's formally a country . 
  the system might have changed but we have still the same pack in charge , every next elections the same people under new mask are being elected . 
  the economy was going forward since not because how they rule but it would go forward with or without them anyway . 
  and we 're not doing as well as the media are trying to show us . 
  maybe they do n't believe in change anymore . 
  that 's why many people do n't vote in poland . 
  i feel european as a second thing after being polish , especially when we have eu , common european government and policies which actually influence us on daily basis , i definitely feel connection with other european countries in difference with other in the world , yet being polish at first place . 
  i thought it did n't load correctly, 
  please , do n't start a shitstorm here . 
  for me it looks like a wheat with an ear and an eye in random places - wtf, 
  that was supposed to be a lion ? 
  maybe because cheap german porn, 
  in poland an average person gets ~ 350 euro per month , living costs are n't any cheap . 
  [ i 'm not playing who 's got worse , just wanted to add here . ], 
  yes , the mysterious phillipine 's disease . 
  still there are barcodes on those things, 
  well that 's romania , vampires and shit . 
  whew , good i 'm in central europe , 
  but how can unemployed afford a car ? 
  son of a priest . . ? 
  is n't it any derogatory ? 
  i was looking for something weird on this picture , i had to check comments to see what 's this about . 
  it 's -1 and heavily snowing where i am . 
  and the media are bought by the biggest politican parties, 
  they added more cities in russia too . 
  yeah , they cancelled work in germany cause of some privacy concerns , and now there wo n't be any more , that 's stupid . 
  i do it the same , only that i put some sugar in it . 
  [ `` rota '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lrlznsn_0g ) , very beautiful , this would be a better fit for the national anthem . 
  [ bogurodzica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgttapxgwxa ) unofficial religious hymn of old poland . 
  `` wesele '' comes from the word `` weso\u0142y '' ( happy ) indeed but it 's not the same . 
  it 's like ` time of joy ' .
