  city underwent an economic crisis in the 80s . 
  at the end of the 90s they decided to focus on developing toursim , culture ( lille became the european capital of culture in 2004 ) and advanced technologies . 
  oh , and euralille is a famous example of the regeneration of postindustrial areas . 
  eh , i would love to go to some polish wedding now . 
  why my friends do n't get married ?!, 
  oh my , i remember this stream !, 
  we 've had a blast . 
  hey , at least i know i 'm not * completely * average / r/europe user . 
  i was thinking more about civilised and classy but hey , whatever , 
  [ we really do n't like it colourful okay ? 
  my parents lived in the 80s warsaw and say it was utterly depressing and grey . 
  but i guess no billboards/adverts everywhere would be a nice thing to bring from the past . 
  surprise surprise . 
  right ? 
  they 're not bad looking to me . 
  it 's a donkey  but it 's a lovely photo , very absurd . 
  miss italia all the way !, 
  i like this `` do not fuck with me look '' she has on the left photo . 
  but the first thing i noticed is the eyebrows and how thin they were . 
  eh , how could i know ? 
  i 'm not american nor was i protesting . 
  it seems like general woman issue , not really related to trump . 
  i have hard time finding it too i 'm afraid . 
  i could n't find anything specifically about razors when i checked for example [ ny 's a guide to sales tax for drugstores and pharmacies ] ( https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/publications/sales/pub840.pdf ) . 
  i 've only found shaving products ( e.g. , aftershaves , depilatories , and preshave products ) which are taxable - p. 6 . 
  to be perfectly honest , it 's a bit non-issue for me so i wo n't be checking it further . 
  maybe razors being exempt is a myth , but tampons/pads are still necessities . 
  sure thing , i will check it when i got home , i 'm a bit busy atm . 
  you 're sure it was on women march , not trump inauguration ? 
  do you have a source ? 
  im riding a bus and on mobile so it 's hard for me to check , but im sure ive heard it was the second one . 
  well , im not into us issues much , but it 's actually famous case . 
  ( or i hang out around tumblr too much ) in the us , products that are considered necessities , like food and medical supplies , are usually exempt from state sales taxes . 
  and while tampons and pads often do not fall into that category , a number of other less-crucial items enjoy tax-exempt status in many states , including * razors * . 
  so tampons are taxed as luxury goods , but razors considered necessities . 
   '' ... live as follows : they drink , have cards , have women ( and not a few of those ) and eventually go dancing . 
  women do the following : dance , have men and drink ... 
  naturally , there are exceptions who live normally and quietly . '', 
  i remember these `` regular day in ... '' posts - they were pretty interesting ( you know , in a boring way ) and it 's cool to see them back . 
  leipzig looks very nice and your cats rock , 
  vina tusca < 3, 
  it looks pretty cool actually !, 
  at least on the photo , 
  trying very hard not to envy you , but i 'm failing ... 
  i 'm not saying that germany is dangerous but , maaan , whenever they have extremists they 're like really extreme . 
  sld did n't make it into parliament because of their own mistakes . 
  i , for one , i 'm glad razem and sld did n't stand together . 
  of course the money helps people left in poland , especially those in villages and small towns . 
  since 2004 almost 10 bilion euro was sent back home . 
  do n't bother . 
  they do n't get the difference . 
  it 's funny when i think how this argument would look like in for example in 1912 - - they 're russians , not polish . 
  they 're born and grew up in russia . 
  - but ... but . . , they identify as poles - nooo , ** russians **, 
  maybe you should check `` ventilation corridors '' because it 's pretty much a thing that exists , for example [ in beijing ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/21/china-to-build-ventilation-corridors-in-beijing-to-help-tackle-air-pollution ) or [ stuttgart ] ( http://wwf.panda.org/?204461/stuttgart-green-corridors ) or [ berlin ] ( http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/umweltatlas/edb411_06.htm ) to quote the last one : the air conducting and ventilation pathways , important for berlin , follow the valleys of havel , dahme and spree . 
  they are significant mainly in case of allochthonous weather conditions , in which regional wind systems are formed because of more or less extensive air pressure differences . 
  to be able to make an optimum use of this phenomenon , the shore areas should be kept free and the development should be kept open in the transition areas to the water bodies . 
  oh i totally know that . 
  but i hold city planning in poland after '89 in very low regard and the fact that they allowed new buildings does n't surprise me at all . 
  after all , we 're talking about country which is giving permission to build on the flood plains . 
  the only thing that matters is profit and if you talked about the air corridors few years ago i bet you 'd regarded as crazy ecologist or at least not treated seriously . 
  still , it was nice not having to buy the ticket for one day . 
  thanks , that 's some deep art here . 
  pics or did n't happen ? 
  thank you warsaw  but the air is killing me ... 
  yep , and especially haiti part is interesting as [ some soldiers rebelled against napoleon and later stayed on the island . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_haitians ) documentary in [ french ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugwxpdrihfg ) , [ polish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjgrm8ctm4u ), 
  :d why did i google it ? 
  quite funny but i have to clear my search history now . 
  it 's amazing how much people can twist real events . 
  because there was a monument in gda\u0144sk to women raped ( named `` komm frau '' btw . 
  so i think it was more about raped german women ) by russian military . 
  it was built by fine arts academy student , installed illegally in the evening and then removed after couple of hours when someone called the police . 
  it sparked a lot of controversy back in 2013 . 
  what polish facists though ? 
  i know right ? 
  :d but on the other hand it 's quite bad pr for us , 
  i hate to generalise but in general i would say you got the worst of the worst of our countrymen . 
  awwwww , i like you too romania !, 
  it 's a shame that we do n't know much about you here or that there 're some silly stereotypes . 
  look who 's talking :d what about siobhan , ciaran or padraic ? 
  trust me - these polish names are not that complicated . 
  no white stripes either :(, 
  shush , do n't tell the vatican !, 
  i do n't know really . 
  it sounds probably more like spanish `` hi '' :d, 
  :( but yeah , i 've always been a fan of julia myself . 
  aleksandra is mostly just called ola though . 
  yes , lena is a full name . 
  it can also be used as a diminutive of marlena , milena or magdalena but it 's not very common . 
  hmm , i would n't say it 's about the pope . 
  it 's more about our grandparents generation names making a come back .
