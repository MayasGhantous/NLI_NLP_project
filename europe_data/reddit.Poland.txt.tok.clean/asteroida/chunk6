  no , you probably wo n't even notice the protests . 
  have a nice stay . 
   poland and turkey had parties with comfortable majority and a personality cult around their leader . 
  you mean kaczy\u0144ski ? 
  52 % of poles does n't trust him , 10 % is indifferent , 35 % trust him and the rest does n't know . 
  hardly a personality cult .

   as a polish citizen of lithuania sorry to ask , but i 'm curious - do poles from lithuania generally have dual citizenship ? 
  how does it work ? 
  is everyone bilingual ? 
  42 % for people under 35 is extremely high . 
  excuse me if i remain sceptical ... 0-2 % ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'd prefer poland to be poland and lithuania to be lithuania . 
  no need to make the same mistake twice . 
  my mother was called `` polnische schweine '' in germany . 
  some people are idiots . 
  yep , sorry - guilty as charged . 
  i try to be reasonable , but i find * some * germans sneering and holier-than-thou attitude irritating sometimes . 
  these are germans for you . 
  * edit : ok . 
  i snapped , some germans . 
  please . 
  you ca n't be serious ... 
  do n't bother . 
  people like him must hate women . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  he 's deflecting much . 
  i mean , the beginning was fine but bringing nord stream 2 , 5 passports and vanishing refugees are not the answers . 
  i 'm out the loop . 
  how did he `` slain '' her ? 
  flower crowns suit them !, 
  just gals being pals . 
  it 's illegal to pay them less than french minimal wage . 
  if that 's really happening your labour inspections should go after them . 
  i find it very hard to believe because : a. it 's lllegal and b. why would anyone work for peanuts in france when you can find work in the uk or germany for more ? 
  or even be employed in france . 
  posted workers pay for a social security in their home country . 
  of course polish government will support that system - it 's good for them and bad for you . 
  i do n't believe it 's about workers anyway , it 's about money . 
  `` as a posted worker , you will continue to be covered by the social security system of your home country for a maximum of 2 years . 
  if you are working abroad for more than 2 years , you will have to switch to the social security system of the country where you work . 
  in some specific cases , you can extend your social security cover to more than 2 years . '', 
  do you genuinely think polish workers in france get polish minimum wage ? 
  the only reason they work abroad is higher wage not unemployment . 
  we call it `` ha i em '' - `` i '' means `` and '' in polish so we 've kinda polonized the name . 
  we just do n't care :p edit : ok , sometimes we just call it `` ha em '' , screw '' & '' , 
   do you mean k\u00e5nken , as in the backpack ? 
  is that well known in poland ? 
  yes , this backpack brand - i was just too lazy to look for '' \u00e5 '' to paste . 
  eh , probably 99,9 % of the polish people have n't heard of it , but i 've seen a bit of these backpacks in my city and my best friend has one . 
   yeah , jean-baptiste was a marshal of france under napoleon . 
  the two had a pretty turbulent relationship . 
  if you look close you 'll find napoleon 's imperial eagle on the coat of arms of sweden . 
  oh , i have no idea about this . 
  i will look it up . 
  stockholm and g\u00f6teborg have some kind of a rivalry between them you can not bring surstr\u00f6mming to the plane cute banter with denmark their current dynasty is of french origin ( napoleon times and so on ) they rock on eurovision both as the producers and artists kanken and h & m swedish deluge was more devastating than ww2 linda hallberg oh , and snus, 
  no , we did n't . 
   there even is a german word for this there always is , 
  oh , shoo with your reasonable arguments . 
  they do n't have refugee status . 
  if someone wants to come to poland and be a part of a our society , either as a refugee or an immigrant , he/she is more than welcome . 
  relocating people who do n't want to be in poland in the first place is a bad idea for us and them . 
  oldest surviving mosque in current poland territory i guess . 
  [ here you can see how tatar mosques in belarus , lithuania and poland looked like . 
   can we have a civil discussion ? 
  what are you trying to achieve by offending polish people on this subreddit ? 
   this is the nursery level of immaturity . 
  nah , this subreddit went downhill . 
  it 's pretty hostile these days . 
  it was built in late 18th or early 19th century . 
  nonono , it 's a male issue . 
  nothing to do with a culture . ^ / s, 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  shhhhhhhh , we want to be relevant okay ? 
  do n't spoil it ... 
  eh , not surprising . 
  why not lie if you could get better benefits from the country you feel no loyalty towards ? 
  eh , not surprising .

  thanks guys < 3, 
   because where they come from they could never go to a school . 
  where was that ? 
   for example i am still waiting for a beautifull rich woman that wants to marry me . 
  are you a real prince though ? 
  and there was another [ family who left poland for damascus in 2016 ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/artykul/1665432,syryjscy-uchodzcy-nie-chca-mieszkac-w-polsce-wracaja-do-damaszku ) . 
  so that leaves me confused - is it dangerous everywhere in syria or not ? 
   very religious , conservative , right wing , 90 % think homosexuality is immoral and abortion is murder ... and that 's just the youth . 
  any source for that claim ? 
  [ because the only country in middle east with similar homosexuality acceptance is israel ... ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ ), 
   also , in terms of societal norms poland is much closer to the middle east than western europe ( and especially netherlands ) . 
  do n't make me laugh ... 
   expat - someone who moves to another country not intending to stay permanently  immigrant - someone who moves to another country intending to stay permanently are you sure ? 
  so polish workers who move to the uk/norway or wherever else for short time just to save some money for a house etc. 
  are called expats ? 
  or even white collar workers who do the same ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 've never heard that . 
  `` expat '' is a fancy word for western europeans who do n't intend to integrate . 
  it probably will be deleted . 
  it 's low quality source .
