  public broadcaster is usually government mouthpiece , this time however is a new low . 
  still this does n't mean there 's no free speech in poland . 
  congrats to portugal , not my cup of tea and do n't really like the guy ( he 's giving me some `` im better than you '' vibes ) but hey , for sure , it was quite original . 
  we should get rid of jury vote .

  i hope !, 
  eh , i got used to israel being on eurovision , i hope they will come back .

  sorry the netherlands . 
  cute austrian is back !, 
  belarusian sounds lovely . 
  let 's have next eurovision there guys !, 
  i 'm fed up with this `` evil white men blah blah blah '' . 
  diversity is not only about skin colour . 
  ok is it just me or eurovision is weak af this year ? 
  i would even vote for it if i had some money left ... 
  it was good . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  both . 
  yep , i love it !, 
  especially with some friends and alcohol around . 
  we do n't hate you , we do n't hate you , we really do n't hate you ... :p you lucky spaniards !, 
  sad news . 
  i 'm very sorry about the policeman . 
  ww2 with volhynia massacre mostly . 
  polish - ukrainian history before is quite complicated too as we were a bit of a bully ... 
  i do n't how much current ukrainian migration matters in this survey , but some people probably are not pleased about the immigration too . 
  duh , it 's obvious we like you a lot !, 
  the irish , a great bunch of lads . 
  of course , the difference is huge . 
  in general , turks who moved to germany , austria etc. 
  were quite poor , more conservative and working class . 
  i 've actually seen it for the first time yesterday and it was pretty nice . 
  i liked how de funes was pretending to be an american tourist in some obscure french restaurant . 
  my all time favourite is gendarme or hibernatus ( ? ), 
  though . 
  ouch , savage . 
  no , i do n't believe in ethnicity 's importance . 
  naaah , i 'm just in france and no one was rude . 
  the nicest people were in the south though . 
  well , that was a question from a western european actually , 
  no , thankfully . 
  i hate it . 
  do you have washing machines in your country ? 
  no , we wash things in fcking rivers duh . 
  not us . 
  easily  i do n't know if i could tell slovak and czech though . 
  for me in france it was : having an au-pair , cleaning lady and another extra help and complaining how hard the life is and how you have no money . 
  ok , what about [ celebrating wigilia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wigilia ) , [ st. andrew night ] ( http://polishforexpats.pl/andrzejki-st-andrews-day-celebration-in-poland/ ) or maybe [ zaduszki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaduszki ) ? 
  do you know them ? 
   ethnically , i am lithuanian and polish . 
  while my family does make it a point to keep up the traditions with recipes , genealogy , and some of the language , i still find myself somewhat disconnected . 
  what traditions are you guys still celebrating ? 
  do you have any specific questions ? 
  i lived in [ something similar in style ] ( http://www.twoja-praga.pl/img/budynki/szaserow60/_big/p5250506_1.jpg?1308123745323 ) for most of my life . 
   essentially , i 'm interested in the cultures of the smaller countries of europe , particularly those to which my ancestors belonged i mean , [ we 're in top 10 when it comes to population . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_population ), 
  please , being eastern europe is not offensive . 
  we wear silppers . 
  looking at the shitstorm now , it was totally honest and it caused a rift between the president and pm . 
  hey , i 'm sure it 's true for some people , i 'm just glad it 's not my reality because , to be honest , it kinda sucks . 
  you know what , sometimes i wonder if we live in the same country ... 
  i barely even see priests on the streets , i probably spoke with one last time around 8 years ago when i dropped religion classes . 
  neither me , my parents or even my grandmother go to the church . 
  germany expensive ? 
  it did n't feel especially expensive to me in berlin and i 'm polish . 
  try sweden or even france for expensive imo . 
  i did n't care much for those as a kid , but i remember having `` gummi bear '' one and `` lady '' . 
  i think it is . 
  they 're two major scouting organisations in poland . 
  zhp ( the most popular ) and zhr and one of them is more religious . 
  i was a junior scount once ( 7 to 10 years old ) and we 've had a meeting once a week but i ca n't remember what exactly was going on there , apart from the singing . 
  we 've also have been going camping where we could go hiking , learn some skills ( and you could [ collect some badges ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dcmxhzob9b0/vtltiebx2bi/aaaaaaaabfm/5cjghcx5xaw/s1600/zuchy.jpg ) ) and we had to stand a guard sometimes etc. 
  [ this . 
  i 'm not proud of myself .
