  10/10 would try to pet . 
  vienna and budapest so far . 
  yep , once somebody actually explains how it is done it 's not that hard . 
  for me is different kinds of `` e '' as we have only one in polish and `` u ' like in `` du '' when i 'm * trying * to speak fast .

  one person in my family lives in italy . 
  not much actually , beautiful nature and good weather . 
  do n't know much about native hawaiians though . 
   yes , when i was a kid my parents used to send me to camps because they did n't love me and did n't want me around during summer . 
  my parents once told me that if i do n't like the camp they will come and pick me up back home . 
  it was terrible and of course , they did n't and i had to stay whole 2 weeks ... 
  i was bullied for liking `` heavy metal '' and that was only the strokes . 
  worse summer holidays ever !, 
  we have some children 's limerick `` biedroneczko , le\u0107 do nieba przynie\u015b nam kawa\u0142ek chleba '' which translates to `` little ladybug fly to the heaven/sky , bring us a piece of bread '' . 
  lithuania ? 
  really ? 
  he was a was n't the best president , he 's a notorious homophobe and seems like a total buffoon . 
  it 's not really popular here . 
  it barely makes the news . 
  [ thet 're associated with stereotypical polish family members but in a mocking way . 
  ok , gra\u017cyna is not the presttiest but at least it has a cool history . 
  still , janusz , gra\u017cyna , sebastian and brajan are all tainted now ... 
  we even have so called `` european '' classes in some of the high schools , do you have something like that too ? 
  it 's usually a class with increased numbers of polish language , mathematics , geography and foreign language lessons . 
  students are also encouraged to take interest in issues of the eu . 
  oh my , so there 's other gaston than the one from beauty and the beast . 
  til huh , 
  for boys : franciszek , j\u00f3zef , antoni , stanis\u0142aw and for girls i 'm not really sure they made a come back yet . 
  i associate gra\u017cyna , leokadia ( my great grandma name btw . 
  ) , wies\u0142awa , stefania , genowefa , aniela ( is actually pretty name ) , czes\u0142awa with old ladies and people are not naming girls like that . 
  maybe it 's too soon ? 
  29 and 30 . 
  not so early for 1991 . 
  i kinda lowkey like space . 
   it was mainly because i really did n't like the last `` book '' ( theatre script ) and needed some other fans to discuss it , because noone i knew had already read it . 
  who even likes that book ? 
  i prefer to pretend it does n't exist . 
  delphi < shudders , 
  yes , we had to read it but honestly it was n't one of my favourites and i ca n't remember much . 
  i liked the adventures of tom sawyer , jane of lantern hill and the jungle book much more . 
  really ? 
  we had one yesterday . 
  no idea what it was about . 
  what is this ? 
  i had to google it ... never seen one irl . 
  the only thing you get is a right to use universal healthcare , as long as you 're checking regularly with the unemployment office and proving that you 're looking for a job . 
  you get around 200 euro for first 3 months , next 9 is around 150 euro . 
  after that you are in trouble ... 
  i 'm 172 which feels like an average but i know i 'm slightly taller than that . 
  you only say it because you have n't tasted my dad 's og\u00f3rkowa . 
  more seriously , to each his own . 
  hopefully you had something good in poland , 
  good thing we do n't eat together :d i can see this quarrel . 
  let me finish that sentence for you   barbaric is adding cream to a perfectly fine soup, 
  sour cream does not belong in the soup !, 
  ca n't believe what i 'm reading / u/vertitto :p, 
  [ here 's how it looks like . 
  ] ( https://zakochanewzupach.pl/zupa-ogorkowa-na-rosole/ ) it 's super tasty , epecially during the winter eaten with some fresh bread . 
  yum !, 
  soup from pickled ( ? ), 
  cucumbers . 
  i kinda liked linnahall . 
  it was glorious in its ugliness . 
  at least it looks like a nice place to have a beer with friends ? 
  we say '' \u017cy\u0107 na koci\u0105 \u0142ap\u0119 '' - to live on cat 's paw . 
   or , even worse , birkenstocks and socks to work ? 
  ( or elsewhere , for that matter ) . 
  that went too far !, 
  gods , of course not . 
  i live in a city , so yeah , those places exist  the closest church is quite far that i ca n't hear a thing . 
  it 's quite expensive and you have to get a visa . 
  when someone plans to travel far , he/she usually picks asia instead . 
  no ( hard to believe i know ) probably not . 
  it 's tiring and most of the time i prefer not to interact with strangers . 
  except for the internet , here 's cool , 
  i would laugh much less if it was n't for the irish . 
  thanks for dylan moran and father ted . 
  vienna : after a short visit i 'm really impressed with the city and it usually tops `` the best city to live in '' rankings . 
  tallinn : the city looks nice , it 's quite affordable and i 've always loved the sea . 
  copenhagen : sea , bikes and pretty people, 
   poles have a right to be poles , not have special treatement , special schools and all other nonsense that should be flat out outlawed . 
  polish is not and should never be a local administration language . 
  when in lithuania use lithuanian . 
  well , it seems you signed framework convention for the protection of national minorities so good luck with all that . 
  but let 's imagine you ban polish schools , that should work both ways ? 
  should we ban schools that use foreign languages too ? 
  or bilingual signs in poland ? 
  because you know , we have them in german , belarussian or lithuanian ( depending what part of poland we 're talking about ) . 
  i do n't really care about lithuania or even poles from there , but you sound so insecure and petty that i ca n't . 
  i do n't have my identity threatened by some silly * sign * on the street that i ca n't pronounce ... 
  for maj\u00f3wking of course . 
  vienna is a stunning city . 
  i 'm glad i finally travelled somewhere more to the south . 
  going to vienna , 
  i do n't really cook - maybe once a month if even . 
  i eat at work and during the weekends i rely on take-aways or go outside . 
  if you think about dinner not lunch , i usually eat a sandwich or scrambled eggs so i do n't count it as `` cooking '' . 
  maybe not pissed , but why would young poles speak any russian ? 
   i wonder if they do n't see the need to interact with others : perhaps they are a group of young men who are only there temporarily because that 's where the work is . 
  that 's my bet too .
