  they 're probably in belgium to work for some short time so they do n't feel the need to learn the language or meet locals and so on . 
  add to this that they 're six young guys without wives , girlfriends or family around , have probably some crap hard work so they like to relax and drink after hours not thinking about their neighbours i understand it can be intimidating . 
   i would just knock on their door and say hello , or even just put a greetings card in their mailbox . 
  exactly . 
  it 's very nice of op to think about greeting them with the bottle of wine but i do n't know if they wo n't misunderstand that etc. 
  as a polish person from the big city i have to say we do n't really get to know our neighbours so whatever you do it will be probably a surprise for them . 
  yep , how did you know ? 
  i loved \u015bmigus dyngus as a child - whole day of almost guerrilla-like fights but with water pistols . 
  fun times !, 
  couple times a week i guess . 
  usually in public transportation . 
  ew , no . 
  it would feel gross . 
  can confirm , i did it too !, 
  i know that my mother was a massive fan as a kid . 
  i have n't read the books myself and i doubt it 's popular amongst kids/teenagers these days , but hey , younger polish people of reddit , prove me wrong . 
  never heard of it . 
  i think it beats our disco polo :(, 
  we know , we know . 
  our food and other stuff have terrible opinion in czech republic right ? 
  not surprised with that username , 
  eh , you know , it usually fine to drink in public , but sometimes municipal police needs to get more money from the tickets so you have to be extra careful and it ruins the fun , 
  terrible . 
  cabarets have been very popular for couple of years and they 're usually very low quality , 100 % cringe . 
  i thank god for the irish when i want to watch something i find funny , like father ted or dylan moran . 
  i 've always had a soft spot for polish punk/rock from the 80s ( thanks dad ) . 
  some of my favourites are : [ kryzys - mam do\u015b\u0107 ( i 've had enough ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35r-1artjho ) [ siekiera - ja stoj\u0119 , ja ta\u0144cz\u0119 ja walcz\u0119 ( i stand , i dance , i fight ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bknq1uhrzpi ), 
  oh nononono , [ we 're the plumbers here . 
  ] ( http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/photos/050629/050629_polish_hmed_330a.grid-6x2.jpg ), 
  estonian flag is one of the prettiest in europe imo , along with icelandic and norwegian ones . 
  average is 19 years old . 
  awww !, 
  thanks for the warning , 
  debit card all the way . 
  95 % of time i use contactless payment so it 's fast and i can keep track on my money more easily . 
  i buy more expensive things on the internet anyway . 
  i do n't really like having cash , it 's useful only for giving a tip or something . 
  same . 
  i could understand english quite well while in scotland , with the exception of glasgow . 
  huh , exactly the same here . 
  for both personal and general ( political ) reasons i 'm not optimistic about the future . 
  i 'm worried about europe and my country . 
  everything is long and complicated in polish . 
  [ greece 2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afrozersnk ) , crazy in a good way . 
  edit : oh , and [ france 2014 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjkqciwp034 ) a bit cringey , but i was humming it for weeks after eurovision . 
  and 2014 gave us another gem - [ belarusian cheesecake . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=timgmw-4ehy ), 
  well , to make it short : as long they stay away from my business , i stay away from theirs . 
  not the biggest fan of religion , but i * try * to be sensitive about it , still sometimes it needs to challenged , especially when it interferes with other people lives . 
  probably chemistry , followed by foreign languages and history . 
  english literature was a separate subject ? 
  was it in italy ? 
  man , i love jane austen , but to be honest i prefer adaptations than books . 
  pe no doubt . 
  i also did n't like physics much because i 've always had quite terrible teachers who seemed to hate their job . 
  romanian . 
  i just think it 's cool . 
  maybe next year i will give it a try . 
  duh , of course we do . 
  yes , a lot of times . 
  it 's a mixture of facial features , clothes , hairstyles and extra something i ca n't explain , sometimes it 's just * bam * and you know they 're polish . 
  it 's the same with foreigners in poland , you can recognize they 're not from here . 
  smug westener or not , have an upvote for a good beer taste , 
  not at all . 
  you 're yourself , not your nationality . 
  you can only be ashamed of your own actions . 
  and being polish is not something that defines you - church-going pis-voting conservative is as much polish as a vegan cyclist  personally , i like my country a lot , even if it frustrates me many times . 
  do you remember this * gem * from 2010 ? 
  american tourists in polish countryside - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoix9-rdo0, 
  to be honest , that 's what i would answer too . 
  we may share similar language with czechs/slovaks or history with lithuanians but i do n't feel some kind of great cultural similarity with anyone . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_polish_political_crisis#antisemitic_campaign_and_political_purges if you want to read up , 
  of course !, 
  peanut butter rocks . 
  have n't tried it with nutella , usually with strawberry jam . 
  also peanut butter kitkat or chocolates are my favourite - i love salty/sweet combination . 
  it 's also super awkward when you lean for a kiss and they for the hug or vice versa . 
  like , what do you want ? 
  how can i know ? 
  ca n't we just say hi to each other ? 
  never :d, 
  i know literally nothing about basketball - i was only informed that they were good and it 's the most popular sport in latvia by my latvian friend soooo , 
  i believe that lithuania and latvia * are crazy about basketball . 
  and also very good . 
  * or they 're not that good :(, 
  yep , it was rejected in october . 
  i 'm afraid there is currently no party in polish parliament that stands for liberalisation of abortion law - neither nowoczesna , po nor kukiz would support abortion on demand , that 's how conservative polish politics is in general . 
  i 'm sceptical wether pis will come with their own ban proposal in the future and if they do , i imagine it will be banning abortion when the fetus is seriously malformed . 
  we will see , i guess . 
   what they 're doing ( have done ? ), 
  now is banning it in absolutely all cases , full stop . 
  i did n't pass though , did it ? 
  and it was n't actually their proposal in the first place . 
  abortion law was no different when po was in charge . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i do n't plan to get married , but i 'm not against it - i just do n't see a point . 
  yeah , i meant uni , now i 'm not surprised about your post  for me high school was mandatory french/english/latin . 
  i hated french , loved latin and now i ca n't remember anything from my latin classes and really love french sooo . .  there are some schools these days that offer more exotic languages . 
  you mean high schools ? 
  what exotic languages do they offer ?
