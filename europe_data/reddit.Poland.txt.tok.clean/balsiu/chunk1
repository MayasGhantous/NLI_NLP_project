best wishes !, 
  we are not ? 
  are we sending all the asylum seekers to first safe countries ? 
  are we punishing them for trespassing borders of lots of countries ? 
  are we declining them the right to stay if they came from safe country , or lied ir broke another laws ? 
  we dont do it or do it partially . 
  instead of stopping them when we still could everyone just sat down and didnt give a fuck . 
  i dont know why honestly , whether they just dont care or are too weak to do something ... 
  ~ i wont edit most of typos and wording . 
  english is not my native tongue so i do know i 'm making lots of mistakes , i just hope i 'm being understandable . 
  but to the point : i never claimed otherwise . 
  their entry at the border of eu is legal per se if they will claim without delay to authorities they seek asylum protection ( so they could register and leave the country and register just by the borders in another , and another and another and ... that would be all ok in terms of law ... ehhh ... o_o ) if they fail to do that they are breaking treaties regarding refugees in general and countries laws regarding crossing borders in particular . 
  problem is : 90 % of immigrants ( i 'm taking the number out of my ass to be honest  just mu guess ) , calling themselves refugees come through safe countries - turkey , russia , maghreb countries and so on . 
  obviously that does not mean we can send them back . 
  human rights and treaties prohibit us from mass deportation without going on with asylum processes . 
  but at the same time lots ot the migrants either did come from safe country , crossed borders against the law , applied numerous times for asylum ( often under fake names ) , or simply doesnt come from dangerous places at all ( the wave does not contain only of syrians who do need some kind of help ) . 
  mate its ok to say you were wrong if you were  we are all trying to get a grasp on this thing and learn a thing or two . 
  so do i every day . 
   article 31 of the geneva convention says : the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ** in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , ** provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities ** and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  thus it does not refer to immigrants who come from safe countries . 
  mate , that one is pretty obvious . 
   article 4.3 schengen border code : without prejudice to the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 or to their international protection obligations , member states shall introduce penalties , in accordance with their national law , for the unauthorised crossing of external borders at places other than border crossing points or at times other than the fixed opening hours . 
  these penalties shall be effective , proportionate and dissuasive . 
   the flow of migrants had a direct knock-on effect on the western balkan route , where people who had arrived in greece were recorded for the second time re-entering the eu . 
  in the october-december period , there were 466 800 detections of illegal border-crossings associated with the migratory flow from serbia to croatia . 
  austria : `` illegal '' entry of individuals to the austrian territory is sanctioned with an administrative fine of 100 to 1,000 euros or up to two weeks of imprisonment ( art . 
  croatia : article 42 a natural person shall be subject to a penalty of a 30 day prison sentence or a 2.000 to 10,000 hrk fine and e administrative decision on expulsion if alien crossed or attempted to cross the state border illegally . 
  the prohibition of entry and stay issued in a decision on expulsion may not be less than three months or more than 20 years ( 107aliens act ) estonia : illegal crossing of the state border or temporary border line of the republic of estonia , if committed is punishable by a pecuniary punishment or up to one year of imprisonment . 
  the same act , if committed 1 ) by using violence ; or 2 ) by causing serious damage to health ; is punishable by 4 to 12 years ' imprisonment . 
  germany : the administrative offence in accordance with \u00a7 98 , section 5 , german residence act ( aufenthg ) , can be punished with a fine of up to euro 3,000 . 
  italy : the sanction imposed as a penalty is a fine from euro 5,000 to euro 10,000 euro . 
  sweden : a fine or a maximum of 1 year imprisonment . 
  norway : the punishment can be a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both . 
  there are other obviously , but i 'm at work and cant really go on with all of it . 
  some of those penalties are administrative , other are penal , yet it all comes to breaking the law . 
  well . 
  being immigrant does not allow you to cross lots of borders without permision just becouse you are yelling ` asylum ' right ? 
  that would be breaking the law of particular countries whose borders has been illegaly breached . 
  youre right . 
  althought they would still be sent to the first safe country they came by . 
  that is partialy true . 
  but this is connected one to another . 
  if we would firmly keep up to our laws and send them back as thi all starte the numbers would be definately smaller . 
  why go through half of the africa and then through mediterrean to just get send back another day ? 
  the same with other migration directions as well . 
  it makes you wonder : if he could avoid corruption of money and power he could become another hungarian hero but that wont happen , eh ? 
  and honestly this fella is doing better than the other goverments . 
  that would make them `` backwards '' wouldnt it ? 
  well ... one may ask for asylum only in first safe country he came to . 
  so basically 90 % of immigrants should be sent back to turkey or russia or some north african country where they arrived . 
  and yet we dont give a fuck and happily register them in centrl or northern europe where they came illegaly crossing couple borders while breaking the law . 
  well you got me there  in poland we didnt feel it that much ( or at least not where i lived ) . 
  althought the number was taken pretty randomly , refering to rather small ammount of illegal immigrants ( at least comparing to whats now ) in the past . 
  but im not shure if we can compare immigrants to refugees . 
  i have to agree with most of what yo usay but compasionate was an irony on my part . 
  she says she is but at the price of her ( german ) or our ( europenas in general ) people not her price so its just a words and i do get it . 
  the crisis was rising , you are right . 
  and if we would stop them now , with stron will to send them back according to our laws , while changing them , we wouldnt be so mych in shit right now, 
  maybe you are right and i would need to check it throughly with some decent translation . 
  media comments tend to distort sens of ones words but even then actions towards immigrants , or lack of actions , or taking slow actions while providinng money/shelters without work etc makes for a good invitation :(, 
  while i aknowledge shes unfortunataly one of the biggest politics in last 20 years of europe and i do know shes populistic , manipulative and opportunistic , inviting immigrants to germany does not seem as `` pushing away '' , more likely like drawing them . 
  she can . 
  and now what ? 
  it must be funny do to base your whole statement with some media - biased opinion with no support in facts . 
  it mus be funny to feel all superior and looking down on me yet you have no idea what you are talking about while being quite openly xenophobic . 
  way to go :d, 
  hey mate , greeting from poland  while the media tend to say the same shit as everywhere in europe about orban some of us aree able to look at him ( with the good things hes done and the bad ones ) objectively . 
  for all i know he did minimum of the right things in all this mess regarding immigrants so i hope eu wont force on you guys anything bad in this matter . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9ydf7uidqo ask her about her rights . 
  i see no reason to treat my rights ( as a european , since youre so cunning and trying to pick on something like that ) as secondary to their rights . 
  even more . 
  we are at home . 
  we are the hosts . 
  our rights should have a priority . 
  theres one and only one thing that can save us . 
  and its not `` unvolountary quotas '' for all eu members . 
  its sticking to our own law . 
  why all of a sudden , after like 50 years theres suddenly sucha a problem ? 
  becouse those immigrants saw that we are unable to abide to our own law regarding immigrants . 
  so , if we wont send them back , stop them or anything , why would they give a flying fuck about our borders and about our law ? 
  they wouldnt . 
  thats why they are coming . 
  also ... 
  the law has holes , the law , becouse of `` human rights '' ( which obviously apply only to other people , not european ) we cant really sufficiently defend ourselves , and they all are exploiting it . 
  nedt time merkel will will say some stupid shit about compasion ask her about compasion to europeans . 
   the day i get to become world leader , is the mankinds population is reduced to 200 million . 
  we need more compassion and empathy i see what you did there , 
  that changes literraly nothing . 
  there is no law that would bring anything about planned forces ( they dont really know yet how they will be constructed ! ), 
  being similar to those fucking bastards . 
  there are no final decisions about implementing those things in any law actually . 
  and even if , that would actually act in favor of opposition nad make them nothing like sa you populist . 
  nations will does not mean goverments will if we assume that most of our society would be against current goverment . 
  im not even going into difference between general directives and tenets ... 
  we both know that political force behind most of the protest are po ( kod leader was taking part in po actions during presidential elections ) and nowoczesna . 
  we were talking big politics not grasroots . 
  its obvious that normal manifestantes are mostly not inclinded politicaly ( in sense that they are not members of political parties ) . 
   oh , i do n't know how to properly name polish offices in english so i dont know anything about democracy . . yes . 
  wrong . 
  you know little , becouse you say something that have nothing in common with democracy per se as something that is supposedly dismantling democracy .
