  \u2022 \u0429\u0449 \u015a\u015b ( polish ) the sound of \u015b does not correspond to the former , which is a double consonant ( szcz using polish or \u0161\u010d using czech ) .

  incredibly insightful , and 100 % spot on .

  we should follow the uk , and start getting ready asap for a long transition period . 
  a massive bowl of oatmeal with chocolate soy ` milk ' and a packet of frozen blueberries , 6 times a week . 
  on saturday an 8-banana smoothie , with a packet of overnight-defrosted strawberries , sometimes with coconut water added . 
  to me it 's far more important if it 's organic/eco/bio , clean energy , cruelty-free , so i 'd say 1 or 2 .

  cameron did n't succeed in blocking juncker 's ascendancy , unfortunately , and we 're now dealing with the repercussions . 
  the frontal assault on a member country that has taken place in the last two years is without precedent , as is blackmail using cohesion funds . 
  france is in the driving seat now that the uk is neutralized , and with macron 's election we 're seeing the new direction the eu is taking . 
  they do n't want partners , they want weak client states , and sbuse tbe so called european values that they themselves violate , to drive us out . 
  i give it another two years . 
  it was fun while it lasted . 
  there is a concerted effort to drive us out .

  i do n't think architecture is the topic of national conversation , or perhaps i 'm just out of touch ( and i do n't watch tv ) . 
  for me , it would be oscar niemeyer from brazil , responsible for the \u00fbbercool bras\u00edlia & a slew of other ` futuristic ' contraptions in the country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oscar_niemeyer not my thing ( all that concrete !, 
  ) , but his works definitely make an impression . 
  hungarians are antisocial ?? 
  i know ... but if it really comes to that , everybody will be affected , and the knives will be out in full . 
  hundreds of thousands of italians , the french , and spaniards live in the uk too .

  g\u00f3rny \u015al\u0105sk & krak\u00f3w because of heavy industry & questionable side effects . 
  otherwise : the capital , even though that 's where i was born and bred . 
  i made good on it and moved out . 
  too much of a bladerunnerish beehive , and not enough greenery for my taste . 
  also , now with the climate change it 's become too hot and stuffy in the summer . 
  like the cool foot cream i just applied ... 
  another vote for california . 
  ca n't stand that fucker . 
  arrogant , anti-polish federast with delusions of grandeur . 
  i 'd like to meet that five footer in a dark alley , just me and him . 
  optimally , it would need to be a large island with no neighbors . 
  there is only one such , but it 's fugly , so ... the second choice would be spain . 
  neither germany nor russia would fit into portugal , and the pyrenees are quite defendable . 
  similar size , too . 
  i would pick the northern coastal mountains as the only green place with breathable air , as the rest seems to be a sizzling frying pan ... 
  i do believe we would lose a few million of weaker folk to heat initially . 
  that freedom though makes it worth the hassle , 
  germania , polonia , czechia , slovakia , hungaria , austria , slovenia + partial borderland grab : transylvania , switzerland , croatia + minas morgul military exception up there, 
  i think we have a winner :d, 
   diet russia haha , i 've never heard that expression before , i 'm stealing it , 
  are auslanders allowed to disagree about the wardrobe of your president ? 
  i think there are way too many cagers with flimsy excuses for car usage , which results in much smaller demand for public transport than should be the case , which in turn leads to lower frequencies , which turns people off further ( negative feedback loop ) . 
  tge end result in this agglo is a substandard network of buses compared to the capital , for example , where none of this is an issue .
