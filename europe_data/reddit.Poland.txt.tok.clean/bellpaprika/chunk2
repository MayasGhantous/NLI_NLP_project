  next , due to topography the commuter rail and tram networks are limited in scope . 
  there is not enough money for tunnels under small mountains , or tunnels under the commercial and historic centers , though such ideas are floated . 
  overall , it 's a bit underwhelming , but it works for most districts , and the infra in the new ones at the outskirts of the city is being worked on . 
  finally , i think the cycling infrastructure counts as part of public transit system , and this is where my city excels , and is also one of the reasons why i moved here . 
  well , of course not . 
  the point is that condiments are chock-full of refined sugar , fats ( often saturated ) , salt , and preservatives . 
  the video in question is useful as an illustration for those who do n't / ca n't count , and are unaware of what they consume on a daily basis . 
  there is an epidemic of obesity for a reason , and said industry is not helping . 
  none , and this is the reason for it : https://youtu.be/wpxt3shafo8 i use raw tomato passata instead . 
  us english , all varieties except the most hardcore ebonix , because i ca n't follow . 
  yes , even texas . 
  for example , i could listen to this guy talk for ages https://youtu.be/tej3zk91uvq my favorite , hmm , i guess the katie couric edition of us english would end up the winner . 
  no , but i certainly was !, 
  that was in 1995 . 
  i got asked by an american , in person , whether we had tv in poland . 
  running , not much , unfortunately . 
  cycling yes . 
  as i wrote in another thread of yours : r1a & n  r1b & e1 as a rule . 
  given my prefs i 'd say norway , although they tend to hit the wall pretty quickly . 
  past 40 , i prefer the fit ones ( best of all , vegan & sporty ) , but those are hard to find anywhere on a continent where a fifth to a quarter of the adult population are * obese * , and between 50 and 70 % are overweight . 
  these numbers are much worse once for those my age or older . 
  i 'm not into lard , so ... 
  slim pickings , then . 
  / listens to * one night in bangkok *, 
  by world standards , none by far . 
  by euro standards only , italy perhaps . 
   do you think they are attractive ? 
  sure , r1a & n  r1b & e1 on this continent , as a rule  physically that is . 
  otherwise , i do n't see any difference between the local set and the global set ~ you can love them , or you can understand them , but not both . 
  i remember the 70s , though only through a child 's eyes ... 
  what about `` croatia proper '' , would n't such a name be controversial ? 
  does it have to be death ? 
  i think 40 years of hard labor and solitary confinement is much worse . 
  but if you insist , then : a ) collaboration with an aggressor state , such as rf ; b ) demonstrably false rape claims that lead to a man 's incarceration and subsequent suicide ; c ) bullying/molestation of weak pupils that ends in suicide, 
  @home : the gda\u0144sk / sopot combo as for the rest of the continent , i prefer smaller towns , as only portions of the big ones are presentable , among other things . 
  so from the tiny category : \u00c5lesund , from the medium : freiburg im breisgau , and from the large : munich/vienna . 
  i did n't like any of the megacities i visited . 
  sortakinda , because the great outdoors in an equatorial climate should be functionally equivalent . 
  otherwise , no , i do n't think it 's healthy ... 
  i have never travelled anywhere `` to relax '' , i can do that at home ... 
  given my lifelong interests and passions , i pick a destination , and often it is a country/place which i have already visited and keep returning because of love : each time doing something different . 
  some countries are so diverse and/or adventure-potential-packed that there are not enough lifetimes in a cat to cover even the bare essentials . 
  i know , i 've tried really hard . 
  or , i pick something new . 
  example : sierra nevada del cocuy in colombia . 
  i research how to get there the quickest , and i set off . 
  i do n't know spanish or portuguese , and so far it has n't deterred me from my travels in latin america , so i do n't see a problem . 
  when i 'm out on a mission like this , i only talk to others when i have to , or when i have already bagged the prize & i 'm on the way back . 
  for city trips far out there , i research on the net , imagegoogle what i can , and then get a plane ticket , preferably returning from abother city . 
  airline shopping is pure pleasure ; i take my time . 
  living is a beautiful place is to me an essential component of what i consider `` quality of life '' . 
  when i first saw `` nothing to declare '' : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nothing_to_declare_ ( film ) i could n't stop laughing . 
  watched it 3 times to date . 
  that belgian really reminded me of some obnoxious ethno-narcissists so many of whom i met elsewhere ( neither be or fr ) , it was uncanny . 
  i really recommend this film !, 
  it is home to denali , a truly hardcore mountain only for those with papayas for balls . 
  plenty of glaciated awesomeness , the bloodcurdling kodiak bear , the out of this world aleutian islands which never ever dry , the tiy diomede island from where you can moon the russkies , ice-cold fairbanks full of larger than life truckers , the age old inupiat in barrow , and lots of plain regular wilderness which still manages to kill greenhorn students of life who ca n't even ford a stupid river , only to die in a bloody bus . 
  alaska ? 
  that place is beyond cool . 
  i 'm vegan , so i do n't eat anything you listed there . 
  my use of processed foods is beyond minimal . 
  i eat fresh and cook from fresh . 
  i also do n't use condiments or anything that needs refrigeration . 
  fruit & veggies about 5-7 times a month . 
  i run out of different things at different times , and that also applies to ` dry stuff ' , like beans , chickpeas , buckwheat , oats , etc , so as needed . 
  usually once a week . 
  maybe twice in winter when i supplement a bit with frozen veggies , because i eat these immediately or the next day at the most ( no fridge lifestyle ), 
  has it ever occurred to you that people travel to different places for different purposes ? 
  go somewhere massage your ego , the butthurt is real . 
  their trebuchets are pointed right at us . 
  enemy territory . 
  best/worst would depend on the category ... * architecture * : : best = norway for the villages , germany for the cities , and hong kong for the skyline . 
  worst in all three = uk * nature * : : best = greenland for the mountains & brazil for the colorful wilderness , worst = netherlands * culture & local color * : : best = brazil & vietnam , worst = uk * cuisine * : : best = thailand ( used to be mexico when i was still an omnivore ) , worst = denmark * humans * : : best = i really have to say slovakia here , but in my case it 's not fair , so : usa , worst = austria/norway ( ca n't decide ) * cycling * : : best = poland , worst = none so far, 
  it totally is n't - you are way too hard on yourselves ... 
  so this very modern sample is inaccurate then ? 
   https://youtu.be/41lzmgcrwhu, 
  depends on whether it 's length or girth  most of us did not undergo genital mutilation , so length measurement in milimeters can be as tricky as measuring the coastline . 
  nail polish & an anklet are the only things i wear down there , 
  i chose the one on the left : https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4030/4646637491_acf0c3e4f0_b.jpg, 
  there has been no sign of a heatwave in northern poland this year . 
  not a peep . 
  the winter was snowy like in the old days , the spring cool and sunny , and the summer luke i remember in the 80s : 25 \u00b0 max , for a short while only , and on some days only . 
  i 'm super happy about the weather this year , 
  otherwise english , but only in the us standard vernacular , sorry . 
  some small languages i heard in tv clips on youtube sounded cute , but the samples are small , and when i followed up , i often did n't like what i found . 
  i first heard about it on * good mythical morning * last year . 
  tried it later , did n't like it much , not going to buy again . 
  i was into spicy nost of my life , but not anymore . 
  oh , and it has a nearly unpronunceable name . 
  no idea if it has any consumers here . 
  you can get it in a deli , among tons of other sauces & additives . 
  does n't stand out . 
  by ` cannabis protein powder ' do you actually mean hemp seeds ? 
  bean burritos, 
  diet = low fat vegan . 
  a typical day : breakfast : choco oatmeal ( rolled oats , oat or soy sweetened notmilk ) , bananas , apples lunch : cooked buckwheat , watered down ajvar ( peppers , aubergines ) , dark greens ( ruccola , chives and unsalted tomatoes , lettuce ) . 
  or a fresh beet soup with carrots , parsley , and lemon juice , sometimes potatoes too . 
  kohlrabi or bell peppers for dessert dinner : always a warm , large meal , eg large , white beans cooked with peppers or chili . 
  or soy strogonoff with brown rice or barley , coked green or yellow beans . 
  or fat-free baked sweet potato .
