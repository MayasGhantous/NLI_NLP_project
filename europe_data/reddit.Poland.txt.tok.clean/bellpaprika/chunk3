  or a `` pizza '' with whole grain cake , aubergines , bell peppers , onions , garlic , mushrooms , and tomato passata . 
  pears and fresh dates for dessert . 
  drinks : mostly sparkling water , tap water with wild rose syrup , tomato juice with pepper . 
  hot drinks : peppermint , herbal teas,

  it reminds me of the polish passport design from the 90s , best ever . 
  i ca n't stand the uniform blood red eu crap everyone has now : /, 
  mnich : http://www.nieznanetatry.pl/images/galeria/big/1273745297.jpg, 
  that reminds me of all those celebs who publicly threatened to move to canada if first bush and then trump won the election . 
  is it a thing in slovenia also ? 
  i have one sibling . 
  i 'm childfree and pretty happy about it . 
  is hazing of young recruits an issue in the bundeswehr ? 
  yes , i remember my granny feeding me that a few times when i was tiny . 
  it must have been a repressed memory , because i do n'tcrecall ever thinking about it since the 70s ... 
  awful stuff , really !, 
  administrations of closed estates here usually have a contract with a landscaping company , which takes care of the greenery surrounding the building ( s ) , from lawns to more elaborate gardens . 
  i have a friend from georgia . 
  this is what he said about his country : `` culturally in europe , geographically in asia , and economically in africa '', 
  re : language - i 'm in the minority here in that i believe everyone should speak english , including locals , and especially those on state payroll ( including health service and all emergency services ) , effectively making english one of the official languages . 
  officialdom is the only real obstacle for an auslander . 
  learning polish should only be a bonus , with the choice up to the auslander how much they want to become one of us . 
  it certainly is not necessary in day to day life . 
  re : employment - as long as they are not on state/taxpayer tit , who cares ? 
  it 's not hard to find a job . 
  see also # 1 re language . 
  re : values - are these the famed `` european values '' that opportunistic and hypocritical politicians wipe their asses with constantly while at the same violating them en masse when it suits them ? 
  because if yes , then my answer would be no . 
  the last thing we need is another pompous prick lecturing us what savages we are , and screwing us from behind when we 're not looking . 
  otherwise , just being normal would do . 
  if a deviation from the norm involves any kind of harm to the natives , then it 's a fail . 
  re : religion - it 's more the barbarism of religion rather than faith tgat is the issue , because religion is inexplicably tied to tradition . 
  if it differs from the norm - see the end of # 3 . 
  nobody gives a damn if at home you worship imaginary devils or angels , pedos from the desert , or even ... verhofstadt . 
  no need to be catholic either , contrary to some drama queens far away may claim . 
  re : free time - whatever . 
  re : culture - whatever . 
  bonus questions . 
  re : integration success - sure , all my intl students from the 90s , for example . 
  that was a long time ago though , in another century . 
  nowadays ukrainians are a big success story . 
  may all our future immigrants be as cool . 
  re : integration fail - do n't know any . 
  we 're still holding out and resisting the fucking eussr quotas and associated shitcuntery and blackmail . 
  population replacement quotas from.now ad infinitum - 90 + % uneducated illegals proof , let in without consultation with anybody . 
  if we give in , we 're done for . 
  if push comes to shove , i hope we 'll trigger article 50 in time . 
  ~ ~ typed on a phone, 
  where ? 
  no , but that 's because i 'm not interested in having a relationshit ; whether it 's of mono or of cock carousel type is rather secondary . 
  i have no problem with others indulging themselves though . 
  yes, 
  local organic greengrocers for veggies/fruits , plus * piotr i pawe\u0142 * for everything else ( which is n't much ), 
  average here = ~ 1500 $ / m ^ 2 . 
  the market is hot and has been for years . 
  well , you asked ... so : 1 . 
  our lass , born just off the border , in cz : https://youtu.be/clmjwj-y5io 2 . 
  i actually prefer serb/bosnian stuff myself . 
  here is a sample of goran bregovi\u0107 : https://youtu.be/_zv_lblu5vo, 
  no , i ca n't think of a single overly religious country around here with very low divorce rates , hence the question . 
  example ? 
  i recommend * autumn sonata * . 
  very dense , but worth it, 
  ogniem i mieczem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/with_fire_and_sword_ ( film ), 
  i would find it incredibly funny . 
  not just me - long ago there was a tv show where a polish host ( a hot woman who married a foreigner , fittingly ) had international guests ( settled in poland permanently ) speaking polish , and taking the piss . 
  it was very popular , because there is nothing funnier than auslander accents , and laughing at these poor souls was the whole point . 
  wait , no ... our southern brothers speaking their own language are the perennial # 1 :d, 
  from those which are not terribly embarrassing , i think this will do , just about : yello & shirley bassey - `` the rhythm divine '' https://youtu.be/smwr21sdqey lyrics here : http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-rhythm-divine-lyrics-yello.html, 
  yes , but the foreign footballers were also given other phrases to try and pronounce . 
  in short , the language will kill you . 
  there is no rule , anything goes . 
  plenty of men manscape , judging by the crowds on the beach , and i personally think that 's good . 
  i 'm a cyclist & a swimmer , and i remove all hair from my hands/arms/privates / legs/feet because it 's convenient , but mostly because i 'm not a fan of hair . 
  i keep the chest hair because i do n't yet have the type of physique where hairless looks good . 
  in time , it 'll disappear . 
  also , i paint my toe/finger - nails , and for me hair does not compute in that case either . 
  oh yes , he was super witty . 
  this is my favorite : `` my fellow americans , i 'm pleased to tell you today that i 've signed legislation that will outlaw russia forever . 
  we begin bombing in five minutes . '', 
  audio here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_begin_bombing_in_five_minutes, 
  i think you are deluding yourself . 
  it 's not taboo , it 's the backbone of the national character . 
  obnoxioys , ostentatious , nouveau riche , and very gangsta . 
  what you wrote is 100 % untrue . 
  i 'm not interested in a discussion though , feel free to downvote . 
  we live in a lively red district here . 
  very lively at times . 
  too many orgies , threesomes , and bdsm sessions for my liking . 
  i would n't mind a few centuries of quiet masturbation . 
  alone , in case those in sequined leather and gimp masks did n't quite hear , 
  heh , i have n't heard about ` slutstation '  , , 
  i am of a generation that was forced to learn a barbarian invader tongue when i was small . 
  i did everything i could to purge my brain right after the very last exam . 
  i remember the young athletics teacher trying to console us : `` it is useful to know the language of the enemy '' , he said . 
  he might have been right in the context of war , but i still resented the black speech with every fiber of my body . 
  apart from that , i studied english and german , privately at first , continuing with english only in high school . 
  most = norway .
