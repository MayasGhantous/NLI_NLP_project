  ) , they came home in one piece . 
  maybe we just do n't see the precautions they make , because it 's not entertaining . 
  maybe they 're reckless . 
  i would n't do that . 
  it 's good that it 's done . 
  therefore , they doing a good and needed work , imo . 
  let 's not be butthurt that they 're hip about it . 
  that being said , mr. ostrovsky did n't seem like an unreasonable guy . 
  he really was careful . 
  i hope he gets out unharmed . 
  i 'll live with under 21 . 
  over 21 , on the other hand ... makes me pity the guy :(, 
   biedronka is actually portuguese it is now . 
  they started polish , but got bought early on . 
  yeah , people may hate it , but until get paid better or decide to spend more on food the bierda will prey on us happily . 
  a lot of people do n't care about food that much and the big b is close and their pasztet is 0,25 $ . 
   concurrence competition , ftfy . 
   i presume you mean western from eastern ? 
  no , i wrote `` poles from eastern europens '' but your racist austrian eyes just automatically converted it to `` eastern and eastern '' . 
  you monster . 
  ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ kidding , ^ ^ ^ let ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ninja-edit, 
  to be honest , despite what your * babcia * tells you , popular food in poland is not of the best quality . 
  the cattle is often kept in ** abysmal ** conditions , fed shit food and their own feces . 
  vegetables are grown with no fertilizer or inferior fertilizer . 
  and that kind of food is cherished by poles as `` swojskie '' . 
  they just love that trash because it reminds them of their peasant childhood , i guess . 
  then there are cases of road salt being sold as a table salt at a massive scale . 
  the infected beef and bad milk that our export partners reject ( and for good reason ) . 
  shit , even that farming minister was dismissed because of it . 
  and the shit they sell at `` biedronka '' ( polish largest grocery chain ) ? 
  it 's downright nasty . 
  ground pork with < 70 % meat in it . 
  pate with 25 % meat in it . 
  sweetened with the cheapest of sugars and salted to the max with said road salt . 
  the czechs are right about our food . 
  we seriously need to improve on it . 
  wait , they own it now ? 
  i thought we do . 
  interesting . 
  people in austria ^ ^ trololol do n't differentiate ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ western from eastern europeans ? 
  yeah , haha . 
  that 's the paranoid/paranormal rightwingers :d they 're hilarious . 
  they post live feed of their voyages . 
  like : - we 're going by train . 
  why is this so shitty train ? 
  is that a deliberate attempt to discourage our support ? 
  - the train stopped . 
  they 're trying to stall our advance . 
  - turns out the train is broken . 
  they say it 's because it 's winter and the tracks are shitty , but we know better . 
  this maybe my last tweet . 
  they 're probably coming . 
  ( 2hrs later ) - they did n't have to courage to finish the execution . 
  this heroic epic will forever shine like a gem in both our nations histories !, 
  dude . 
  how old are you ? 
  i think kiev expressed the idea to `` decentralise '' the country , not to `` federalize '' it . 
  it 's almost the same when it comes to governance , but entirely different ballgame with political power . 
  did you feel threatened when the cold war was in full swing ? 
  because i feel like russian goals have n't changed since then ... 
  the employer pays the right amount . 
  but then you got deductibles , like internet connection , kid discount , building discount ( these are actual deductibles in poland right now ) that subtract from your tax base . 
  tax_rate * ( tax_base - deductibles ) is the tax you owe . 
  tax_base * tax_rate is the tax you paid . 
  you 're going to get a tax_rate * deductibles return . 
  dude . 
  russia does n't stand in one line with us or china . 
  russia 's big , but not that big . 
  it 's only assets are nuclear bomb and natural resources . 
  it has no population nor economy to match . 
  bringing russia in line would not be cheap , nor easy . 
  certainly not a walk in the park , but it 's doable . 
  the only thing i regret that the west did n't secure russian nuclear potential after ussr collapse . 
  it bites us in the ass . 
  classic ex-communist state citizen :d `` i can and will badmouth my country 's shitty standards of living , but if any foreigner wants to , i 'm going to defend it to the death '' :d, 
  if russia messes with nato , the deterrent ought to be a nato bombing up putin 's ass . 
  are we going to sell our allies for a `` severe sanction '' , really ? 
  no u, 
  that 's the coat of arms . 
  and what everyone actually uses . 
  i only know about the flag color because the city buses use these colors . 
  newest cospiracy : kaczynski blew his brother . 
  now you 're talking about realpolitik . 
  fine . 
  it 's true . 
  but then why do you mention `` the promise '' ? 
  if you understand that only interest matter and not idealism , then it should be clear that both nato and ex-soviet states had vital interest in joining the alliance . 
  you say , if nato would not expand , putin would sit quietly ? 
  maybe . 
  but if the su would not exploit it 's vassal states then maybe they would n't want to join nato so much . 
  maybe if not the russification , nor gulag , nor stalinism , nor nep , nor everything that 's fucked up happened in russia 's history - happened , then we would n't have the problem we have today . 
  and that problem is russia . 
  has been for several hundred years . 
  i once hoped that russians themselves will someday take their country back , democratize and prosper , like poles do . 
  i no longer believe that , i just hope that russia gets dismantled . 
  the current polity is a threat to free , prosperous world , to the existance of happy people everywhere . 
  it should just collapse . 
  conversely , if you happen to watch a laugh-track show that has it 's laugh track muted , you 're going to scratch your head and wonder why in the world you found it funny . 
  [ case in point ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jks3mgrizcs ), 
  pretty accurate !,
