  we do have a word for that , too : `` waha\u0107 '' . 
  when applied to a peron it means `` to hesitate '' , but it also what the pendulum does . 
  shame we do n't use it for `` communite '' as it fits perfectly . 
  i thought it 's / r/nottheonion ... 
  u w0t m8 ? 
  more subpages = more ad displays, 
  yeah , good question , except i 'm not qualified to answer ;p . this way or the other , i 'd like to see more ant-air protection against russia . 
  kind of remind me of the [ targowiczans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/targowica_confederation#leading_members ) the leaders of anti-constitutional uprising in polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  their actions unwillingly led to partition and eventual dissolution of the commonwealth . 
  they were subsequently hanged by the popular uprisings ( sometimes they just hanged the image of the guy if they could n't get their handsm on him ) or lived in regret and contempt for the rest of their lives . 
  it looks like janukowicz also put things in motion he can not control . 
  nor he wants to see them moving . 
  poland did experience a sharp fall with corruption . 
  the italian example is convincing , though . 
  the eu could still battle some systemic injustices and mitigate some corruption by strict law requirement but in the end of the day if the laws are not obeyed , the corruption will not fall all that much . 
  more like install it already . 
  obama chickened out from it , probably afraid of putin 's naked torso . 
  umm ... 
  i do n't think it 's true . 
  before poland joined , there was a national effort to bring the legislature `` to the eu standard '' . 
  the new laws were designed so there 's little space for corruption : all the public orders needs to have verifiable and measurable requirements , the policemen can not collect fines in cash , etc. 
  i do n't know if that was in reality forced by the eu or just advertised a that , but it kind of worked . 
  poland also did some more corruption cleansing after . 
  maybe it 's aligned with our interest ? 
  also , both are greater powers . 
  conversely , the czechs do n't tell us what to do xd ^ ( except sometimes they passive-aggresively flood our cities by pissing to oder ), 
  sadly i lack knowledge about the issue to agree or disagree . 
  it sure sounds probable , though , and i have heard the calls to modernize the power grid because of it 's abysmal state . 
  about the climate change and it 's costs - as far as i know , it 's very hard to predict what climate change will mean for a region in the long run . 
  one thing we know -- the ocean levels will rise ( are rising ) . 
  we 're realtively safe from that danger -- the baltic is separated by danish straits from the north sea . 
  and we only have the tricity on the coast . 
  i mean , due to climate change the ** whole ** amsterdam can end up underwater . 
  no money could buy you out of this . 
  and i do n't think moving the whole city is viable -- it will just be destroyed , kind of like it 's happened to new orleans after katrina . 
  i ca n't even imagine the scale of losses . 
  this is the fate of many coastal cities in the world . 
  poland 's got 99 problems but that one is n't ours  . 
  this is only a slice of repercussions of climate change , but a very costly slice which we would avoid . 
  thanks, 
  well , to be honest , everybody gets a free pass if they want it . 
  it 's called sovereignty . 
  if i was to personally support the idea of ditching coal in `` about now '' timeframe , i 'm going to need to hear about the incentives . 
  let the countries that contributed most ( through the centuries ) to the pollution foot the bill . 
  or those that benefited the most from their industries ( although that might be hard to calculate ) . 
  let 's provide green energy for poland for the transision period . 
  subsidise the green energy , so it 's not strangling poland 's economy . 
  these are only ideas from the top of my head , maybe it 's possible to find an other solution to make that fair . 
  and i 'm not even sure if poland would have been a huge beneficiary of such a program -- after all , poland was not and is not some kind of industrial wasteland -- it 's possible that poland would have to pay for some mitigation , too . 
  but poles surely do n't want to help you * carry the burden they did not benefit from . 
  and if it falls , we 're not the ones who 'll be getting hit the most . 
  * by `` you '' i mean `` the wealthy states of western europe and north america '' . 
  yeah , the thought process seems to be -- `` it was all fine when you were making yourself rich with no regard to the enviroment whatsoever , but now , after you moved to a service based economy you 're prohibiting us from advancing because all the allowed mess was already done by you '' . 
  ca n't say i disagree with it . 
  the costs of climate change are generally imagined to be much lower for poland than for countries closer to the ocean . 
  i personally do care about the enviroment protection and the rapid changes are scaring the shit out of me but , man , still -- i 'm not going to sacrifice a tiny bit of my living standard to help wealthy guys remain more wealthy . 
  i 'm really sorry for you , but let those coastal cities drown if i 'm getting my energy bill lower . 
  emotional blackmail , i guess ? 
  you better help this time or the whining will never end xd, 
  except there really was n't a place to nuke after that . 
  i 'd say it 's fifty-fifty . 
  people who like disliking whole nations would surely pick russians for their hate . 
  but you hear a lot of `` the russians are fantastic people , but their government is terrible and has been for centuries '' , too . 
  cry me a river , german businessmen . 
  you 're put in most favorable position , having the whole currency devalued by sharing it with other member states , now should be the time when you show solidarity with eu policy . 
  yes , sorry . 
  i did n't check , that was n't you . 
  that was a wiser move that what poles did : reinvented the whole '' \u0161 '' , '' \u010d '' and '' \u017e '' ( as `` sz '' , `` cz '' , and '' \u017c '' / `` rz '' ) thing , so that written polish looks like some kind of consonant bonanza that terrifies foreigners . 
  while spoken it 's very soft , but a bit friendlier to western tongues than russian . 
  the expectation were based on a assumption that a ) poland would fight germany only and b ) the allies would put pressure on germany from the west . 
  that was n't the case so why the heck are you bringing this estimates up ? 
  partition of czechoslovakia was a dumb move but i fail to see how is that relevant to september campaign . 
  and negotiating danzig would be an even swifter capitulation , do n't you think ? 
  anyway , ~ ~ your ~ ~ ( edit : tarambor 's ) sentence `` its hardly like the poles did much to defend themselves at the time was it ? '', 
  is false . 
  i 'm sure ~ ~ you ~ ~ he sees now that in actuality ** much ** was done . 
  it just was n't enough . 
  i made a similar move . 
  i guess i still have a flag but none of you knows what country 's unless you check ;p, 
  sure , i 'm all for ** helping ** . 
  annexation , not so much . 
  they want their state . 
  if they want to align with us , great , we figure out what to do to help . 
  guarantees , alliances , whatever . 
  annexing ukrainian territory helps nobody : 1 . if we do that , we 're becoming enemy of the ukrainian people , 2 . they fail to meet their goal , which is safe , self-determining ukraine , 3 . we 're in deep shit with poor , underdeveloped provices full of foreign people who hate the fuck out of our gorvernment . 
  literally no bright side for anyone . 
  what 's to consider ? 
  lol no . 
  so if a country is suddenly weak and poor it 's our white men duty to annex them ? 
  get that morning coffee , you 're making no sense . 
  cow farts ? 
  ^ ( i 'll show myself out ^ no ^ that 's ^ methane . ), 
  i hope it 's true , but it still remains to be seen . 
  they certainly do n't like it under the russian boot , as seen in 2004 and 2014 . 
  what is going to be the ukrainian path ? 
  find out in the next episode !, 
  yeah , but you got ta admit - the slovaks do n't cheat with digraphs, 
  i do n't know if it 's my bias or what , but russians or russian state apologists on the internet just ** love ** that kind of rhetoric . 
  `` russia , you 're annexing other country land '' , `` oh yeah ? 
  kosovo did it too '' .
