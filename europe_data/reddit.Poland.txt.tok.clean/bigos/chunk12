  `` russia , you 're ruled by corrupt oligarchs '' , `` well there is corruption in germany , too '' . 
  `` russia , stop arming assad '' , `` but you 're arming the other side '' . 
  it 's not even about if it 's right or wrong , they just seem to think that if someone else does anything , they are perfectly justified if they do it too . 
  i do n't know . 
  that was just my bitter remark after watching some of the russian reaction to annexation videos . 
  angst much ? 
  what 's your problem ? 
  well , i think i agree . 
  were media in ukraine less servile to the state ? 
  i mean , why ukrainians blame their government for their bad situation and the russians always blame the foreign powers that komsomolska prawda indicates ? 
  well , i do n't know but i do n't think so . 
  why is n't it a partition , then ? 
  i ca n't think of any reason why not . 
  well , whatever you want to call it , annexation of zaolzie counts as partition . 
  so `` poland did n't partition any of these countries . '', 
  is false . 
  i was once hoping that after ukraine , russia and belarus would wake up , too . 
  that masses of `` normal people '' would rise and overthrow those power-tripping thugs in power . 
  that they will not take it anymore , now that they have the internet and cheap travel , and they can see how the world looks like and how it 's different from their homeland . 
  but i do n't believe that anymore . 
  the russian people are high on imperialism , and the minority of level-headed intellectuals just does n't have the punch to convince the rest . 
  we 're going to have another cold war or another appeasement politics . 
   that 's the first case ever i seen anyone talking about zaolzie as a partitioning of czechoslovakia . 
  well , get out from under a rock !, 
   everybody was calling it that including , but not limited to nazi propaganda . 
  it 's only polish historiography where it 's avoided to use the terms like `` annexation '' or `` partitioning '' in the context other than victimizing polish state . 
  ever noticed how in our history every war is a defensive war but somehow we end up with the biggest blob of land in this part of europe circa 1580 ? 
  yeah , we did some `` partitioning '' , too , except in your history handbook they 're called : `` wyprawa '' , `` przy\u0142\u0105czenie '' , `` zho\u0142dowanie '' and `` wyzwolenie '' . 
   poland did n't partition any of these countries . 
  incorrect . 
  poland did directly participate in partition of czechoslovakia ( took `` zaolzie '' ) . 
  as for ukraine , it 's debatable . 
  there was an independent ukrainian state in 1918 which fought both poland and russia/soviet union . 
  it lost and it 's lands were partitioned . 
  i 'm kind of proud that literally ** nobody ** in poland caught this up . 
  not when \u017byrinowski was making his stupid claims in duma and not now . 
  not even our right-wing nutjobs . 
  the nation is 100 % behind helping ukrainians get through that difficult times . 
  also , what would we do with several thousand square kilometers inhabited by ukrainians ? 
  that 's just asking for trouble . 
  every person who hold strong opinoins on jews in poland is an antisemite and a substantial part of population is just that . 
  you do n't even have to look for it : there are hanged david 's stars graffitis on walls , the football hooligans are calling their adversaries `` jews '' , `` jew '' can be actually used as an insult in polish , as well as `` jewish '' is synonymous with `` stingy '' and `` cheap '' . 
  there is massive opposition to even apologize for those selling jews to nazis in ww2 and polish pogroms after ww2 . 
  if a politician has a jewish roots , it is constantly reminded by right-wing politicians and supporters . 
  in my perception , about 40 % of population is some kind of antisemite . 
  some `` just do n't like them and they crucified jesus '' , others go as far as to threaten jews with death . 
  all that in a country in which there had n't been any significant jewish population for about 50 years now . 
  what is the greek proposed name for fyrom and it 's people ? 
  i mean , they call themselves macedonians , but surely you have another name for them ? 
  i 'm just joking , referring to the fact that no one wants to be described as `` eastern europe ''  . 
  it 's central yurop for fucks sake ^ xd, 
  because you get to sell that meaningless shit for some bling , yo . 
  them ugly bitches . 
  stay in germany . 
  true , true . 
  but the expectation are high !, 
  we 're not going to accept half-assed solutions . 
  the political class knows they need to aim high to impress . 
  achieving moderate success is going to be met with `` meh '' at best and anger at worst . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  i feel the same way , except i think it might just be a good thing . 
  if we 're still dissatisfied by what we got , we 're trying to improve . 
  the side effect is all the complaining , but the bright side is -- we 're still trying . 
  also sanction that traitorous bastard schroeder . 
  i 'd lose my sides if his gazprom money was frozen . 
  i think i have to disagree . 
  the argument that the eu can not work because `` we are too different '' is false . 
  personal feelings aside ( for example i think we have so much in common it 's impossible to live apart ) , the mere fact that the eu integrates more with each year , becoming actually more effective and powerful proves all people who said that in the past wrong . 
  well , you might say : okay , so far it works , but it 'll fall apart at the next thing !, 
  - to me it 's just moving the goalposts , nothing indicates that the eu is dissolving . 
  everybody 's been saying that for years . 
  and we 're still more integrated than ever . 
  and we integrate more every year . 
  achievement unlocked, 
  that would be so funny if there 's actually a brotherhood of all slavic nations , but ** without russia ** . 
  yeah , that 'd show them . 
  is n't the eu founded on that principle ? 
  we 've got common market , right ? 
  nobody can stop any eu company from operating anywhere in the eu . 
  i do n't think it 'll happen till 2020 ... 
  my favorite thread on reddit today !, 
  yeah , it 's like that best rocket , only two models forward . 
  edit : while g20 sounds like a depilation gel xd, 
   gazprom ceo ( zubkov [ 1 ] ) sold all his gazprom stock . 
  well , shit . 
  i fear that indicates that shit is about to hit the fan . 
  26yo , i recently bought an apartment with my fiancee . 
  we 're getting married in june and both of our families contributed around ~ 5k euros for initial payment and taxes . 
  it costed 250k pln ( = ~ 62,5 k euros ) , it 's 58m ^ 2 , 3 rooms , a kitchen , a bathroom and a balcony . 
  located in a 600k city , somwhere between the suburbs and the city center . 
  it 's second hand flat on a communist housing project from the 80s , but in poland it 's not like in those american movies -- housing projects vary by location , mine is very quiet . 
  it was built for the now defunct electric plant workers - they are mostly all retired now so it 's a bit of a geriatria sometimes . 
  i got mortgage on it , for 20 years . 
  i pay about 1/3rd of my monthly income towards it , but the installements are decreasing by time so i 'm going to pay less and less as the time goes on . 
  currently , my friends and acquaintaces are starting to acquire flats . 
  i think 5 or 6 people bought a flat recently . 
  but we 're in a good position , as we 're software developers graduated from a pretty nice school and most of us can afford it . 
  on the other hand , between my friends from high school who chose a different career path , only those , whose parents are well off are getting flats by now . 
  the rest rents or lives with their parents . 
  almost everyone i know wants to own his own flat .
