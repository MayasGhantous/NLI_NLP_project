  i still do n't think poland would n't exist anymore if it was n't for the uk . 
  uh , okay . 
  so what are those guarantees actually good for ? 
  if countries not guarantee things with their military might , what ** do ** they guarantee with ? 
  so you 're saying , ukraine got cheated out of their nuclear potential ? 
  because there would n't be these kind of incursions into their territory if they 'd kept their a-bombs . 
  what message does that send to iran ? 
  what the fuck , actually , what message does that send to me . 
  with this kind of `` guarantees '' i 'm starting to wonder if my country should launch a nuclear program . 
  what am i expecting , that `` the usa or the uk are obligated to intervene militarily in order to safeguard poland '' because they guaranteed it in article 5 ? 
  it 's silly , i guess . 
   they followed through on their guarantees well i do n't have the alliance documents in front of me right now , but i suspect that something more than a * sitzkrieg * was expected . 
  the ultimate letter of concern , the declaration of war . 
  i mean , french troops were already ** at the german border ** but they prefered to sit on it . 
  also , this still does n't explain why if [ the uk ] `` not stepped in poland would n't even exist any more '' . 
   and the nazi plan for poland was ? 
  that 's where my argument stems from . 
  soviet rule was better than nazi rule would have been , hence a net gain i mentioned . 
  i do n't follow . 
  what 's the role of the uk in this ? 
  the nazis attacked , then the soviets attacked , then the soviets defeated the nazis in the east , conquering poland . 
  still ca n't see what 's the role of uk in this and especially how they ensured that `` poland would exist anymore '' . 
   without britains declaration of war hitler would have had free roam to do the things he did and wanted to do he did it anyway . 
  only the soviet offensive in the east and us opening two front in the west was enough to stop him . 
  yeah , ok , i can pretty much agree with this post of yours . 
  yeah , the americans wore ussr down and yeah , winston churchill was probably pure at heart . 
  still , the sentence  `` if we 'd not stepped in poland would n't even exist any more '' is false . 
  you stepped in and let poland perish , then did n't care what the soviet installed does to us until :  we 've overthrown [ it ] on our own . 
  no foreign intervention , we did it , and we did it peacefully . 
  fine , the conditions were right for us , but still no british participation whatsoever . 
  so i guess your remark about us `` not existing if it were n't for you '' is to be withdrawn ? 
  oh , you give yourself too much credit , brit . 
  your version of poland was actually destroyed , not being recognized even by the uk 's government in the end . 
  the occupied poland had a communist government , installed by the soviets . 
  which , by the way , we 've overthrown on our own , paving a way for freedom in eastern europe . 
  i 'd say - with or without you things would turn out the same in poland . 
  you did n't help jack shit and poland , as a whole , is actually [ still butthurt for it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal ), 
  the us , along with russia and the uk guaranteed territorial integrity of ukraine in return for ukrainian nuclear disarmament in 1994 . 
  as of now , it looks like that they are not going to act with accordance to that guarantees . 
  '' ... expresses it 's grave concern about regrettable incursion of unmarked military with russian equipment into eastern poland . 
  it also inquires all of the involved actors why did n't they invest instead . 
  there will be a letter sent , fo sho . '', 
  i thought i 'm on / r/paradoxplaza for a while, 
  no krs entry ( the company register ) for `` exotic meat poland '' , too . 
   boom , support growing . 
  top lel remember , you ca n't really draw any conclusions if the results lie within a statistical error, 
  dude , i 'm not going to argue with you . 
  you asked for a taboos , here they are , regardless if true or not . 
  this is the message he conveys through media , good luck winning the election with that . 
  i do n't think you understand what it takes to win an election . 
  `` being right '' is not one of these things . 
  also , you 're wrong and have a nice adolescence !, 
  yeah , i 'm not `` pan janusz '' follower either , but here 's a socially allocated advice for him : - `` it was better during hitler 's reign '' is not going to win any votes . 
  - `` let 's segregate disabled children [ so they have no contact with the healthy ] '' is n't going to be considered best educational policy - `` women are inherently less intelligent than men [ but that 's ok , because we love them ] '' will most likely alienate , like , 50 % of potential voters, 
  it was also speculated to be largely ineffective and/or unable to act . 
  supposedly , their equipment is in really bad shape and their morale is down . 
  according to western newspapers from few years back , it 's a paper tiger . 
  i do n't know for a fact how true this is . 
  after all , they did manage to overwhelm georgia . 
  on the other hand , that operation was n't of ukraine 's scale . 
  haha , yeah . 
  i guess it 's because our public transport might be considered expensive by people who live over our eastern border . 
  this probably is thought to ease their travel around poland . 
  what , the russians sacked him ? 
  well , i do n't know about us , but i really , really struggle not to see kremlin as evil band of thugs . 
  seriously , how are they not evil ? 
  i never said it 's not . 
  but i 'm just guessing . 
  i hope his actions end up helping you guys out of that crisis . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  well , not to piss on your parade , but when it comes to politicking this guy could run circles around all the people involved in current crisis . 
  he 's connected to many uk and us officials , he attended the same elitist schools as them , he actually fought against soviets in afghanistan . 
  i 'd bet he knows his game . 
  that he is a giant , raging buffoon is a dfferent matter . 
  i guess he 's trying to intimidate the opposition leaders to sign the deal he fathered so he can reap some sweet politicians karma . 
  but that 's only my guess . 
  you say it woul `` anger the world '' . 
  but what will the angry world do ? 
  who 's going to take action ? 
  yeah , did n't think so . 
  i prefer hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterkofferattent\u00e4ter source : julian tuwim making fun of german language , the anecdote here : http://linguacuriosa.blogspot.com/2009/10/german-for-beginners.html, 
  this one is strange . 
  i have definetely got a lot of friends whose family members work abroad and send money - a lot of them are completely dependent on that income for years . 
  yet , every official statistic tells me that this inbound cash is insignificant in the grand scheme of things , and does n't contribute meaningfully to the economy . 
  it 's weird to me , as it contraticts directly what i see -- but i 'm probably biased ( or gray area , maybe ? ), 
   soviet union cash flow i 'd really need to see the sources of that cash flow . 
  from what i know , poland exported at a loss to soviet union because of politics . 
  maybe this `` cash flow '' was meant for soviet union members , like ukraine , baltic states ? 
  poland was independent and i really do n't know about any significant aid from ussr sent this way ( except fortheir `` brotherly military advisory '' ) . 
  that 's just biased . 
  he was pretty original in pointing your bravery that way !, 
  there 's next to none of them here . 
  they just subscribe to this `` islamisation of europe , whole london is brown now and every car in paris is burned by muslim youth '' rhetotric .
