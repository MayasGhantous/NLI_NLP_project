  also , presmyslids as kings of poland . 
  oh , yeah , and the two defenestrations !, 
  a lot of recruitment goes on there . 
   if welfare turns people form crime why it is that the most dangerous areas in big cities are those where the welfare recipients are the most numerous ? 
  because poor . 
  it 's this third factor that connects the two . 
  poor people are more likely to commit crimes , poor people are the ones that live off of welfare and poor people are the ones who live in the bad parts of the town . 
  also , if think it would n't get any worse if it were n't for things like social housing just look at how slums are like in the regions like subsaharan africa or india or bangladesh , where there really is n't any welfare . 
  now think if you want to swap your town 's bad district for a slum form dhaka . 
  have fun trying to stay in posession of that 10 % tax reduction you get for that swap :p of course there are bad effects of unemployment and i never said it should be promoted . 
  if you think getting social handout is promoting unemployment then you must be a very spoiled kid . 
  no healthy human being want to stay unemployed * for the benefits * . 
  not in my country anyway . 
  it means living in extreme poverty . 
  if you want to discuss this issue , look at my response to / u/jessicasc2 : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1up63z/poland_vows_to_veto_british_changes_to_eu/cekdg6a only coherent and well-mannered responses invited, 
  `` moral obesity '' is n't a thing . 
  i prefer people who are unable ( or even unwilling ) to work being handed out small amounts of money and/or goods than them resorting to provide for themselves in * other * ways . 
  such as violent crime and theft . 
  we have a surplus of workforce . 
  chronic and structural unemployment . 
  we do n't need all those people to work , we 're getting by without them just fine . 
  at the same time the biggest corps are cashing out and evading taxes , not giving back the wealth they extract from the working force . 
  i think they ( the megacorps ) should be the ones that foot the bill for welfare . 
  so , in my opinion , providing welfare : 1 ) protects people who are unable/unwilling to work 2 ) turns them away from crime and all sorts of antisocial behavior 3 ) is affordable on the level we have it now 4 ) could be much improved by the funds that are currently being extracted from national economies by creative megacorps to me , these are all pros . 
  your con is `` bad habits '' . 
  which are what , exactly ? 
  welfare is good because it provides goods and services to people who ca n't get them in any other way let 's start here what do n't you like about it ? 
  that 's great , it 's not compulsory, 
  i 'm certainly not retarded . 
  i think you put ** way ** too much emphasis on ethnicity . 
  this stuff is just unimportant , and if it is -- it is important to the nutjobs like the nazis or nationalists . 
  polish jews were polish citizens , they lived in poland , payed their taxes in poland , and poland owed them protection which , as we all know , poland ( and much of rest of europe ) faied to deliver . 
  whatver traditions or religions they cultivated at home is secondary and only important because they were targeted by the germans specifically because they cultivated that one specific set of traditions . 
   germans do n't miraculously become poles when they get polish citizenship no , but they become citizens of 3rd polish republic which is far more important than some cultural division . 
  they had polish citizenship - they were polish . 
  there is no other qualifier , and that should end this discussion . 
  what ? 
  what 's an oxymoron ? 
  polish jews were people who lived in poland and practised judaism/were of jewish culture . 
  there were n't many left , because of reasons , but it was sizable demographic back in the day . 
  '' polandcirclejerk '' = '' ** space ** polandcirclejerk ? 
  oh you, 
  haha . 
  what an assumption ... 
  `` 95 '' is your year of birth , is n't it ? 
  oh , all right . 
  but if so , then label the east as `` the east '' , not `` eastern europe '' . 
  because eastern europe is not the ancient orient you speak of ( nor descendant of it ) . 
  the standard is improving . 
  things that have been acceptable 20 years ago ( black people portrayed as `` primitive savages '' , direct nationality hate ) are not acceptable by general public anymore . 
  there 's a bit of opposition from conservative circles but more and more people from the silent majority become more open . 
  being outwardly xenophobic ( i.e. 
  accusing whole nationalities of anything ) will get you strange looks , at least in my social bubble . 
  homophoby is still largely accepted in many societies . 
  um , not to rain at your parade , dude , but the [ battle of grunwald ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald ) was one of the biggest medieval battle in history . 
  i 'm pretty sure that anyone even remotely interested in medieval warfare have a pretty good idea what went there and why . 
   i am not german major . 
  because it 's | oberleutnant '' in german , not `` major '' . 
  i 'm saying that russia is the only one that could provide enough gas for ukraine . 
  there is no other option . 
  slovakia actually resells russian gas back to ukraine and so does poland . 
  its price is entirely in the russian hands . 
  there is no other market price for gas . 
  there 's the price that russia wants and that 's it . 
  the market is just this deep . 
  they 're not `` subsidising and selling below market price '' , they 're lowering the market price , because they are the whole market and they know it . 
  we 're working on it , but it takes time . 
  as / u/beiie-and-sebastian said , there 's a pipeline from azerbaijani fields in construction . 
  there are shale gas explorations in central europe . 
  there are many lng terminals in construction , to receive american liquid gas . 
  but all that takes time . 
  meanwhile , poland and slovakia are already testing reversing the gas flow * to * ukraine . 
  we 're diversifying , but it 's got ta take time . 
  in 10 years the landscape would look completely different but until them we ca n't do shit . 
  that would probably be `` czrt '' in czech , but i 'm making this up :d, 
  does that matter whether he believes his country media are 100 % honest or not ? 
  i do n't think it is of any importance . 
  of course they are promoting certain values in european media - political corectness , equal rights for everyone , enviromental issues and so on . 
  the thing is , we almost universally agree that these values are worth promoting and really do n't mind . 
  now , what happens in russia is that the state forces blatant lies in the media for the purpose of preventing other people from participating in what they want . 
   which many intellectuals of the period saw as necessary to defuse the continent 's nationalisms and prevent a third war . 
  yes , the intellectuals . 
  but did anyone communicate this to the working class ? 
  `` hey joe , you know that european union thing ? 
  we 're actually making it a superstate , you cool with that ? '', 
  -- that never happened . 
  because of conflicting expectations . 
  the eu was sold as a `` some kind of trade alliance '' and everyone bought that . 
  nothing wrong with trading partners , right ? 
  also we trust our european goods , and some of them are really fine . 
  so great , let 's have a trading union . 
  but then the integration deepened , the eu became a political entity . 
  some people do n't like that , they were fine with their nation states . 
  now they feel betrayed , that what they knew as a harmless trade agreement becomes a political behemoth they did n't vote for . 
  i do n't have a problem with that , but i know that some people exihbit this unexplainable attachment to their nationality and they 'll be clinging to their nation state no matter what . 
  via wikipedia :  capitalism is an economic system in which trade , industry and the means of production are controlled by private owners with the goal of making profits in a market economy that 's exactly what polish economy was n't before 1990 , but it could be used to describe polish economy now . 
  look , i think i know where are you going with this ... 
  i do n't particuralry care about the labels , i might have used the term `` capitalism '' as a euphemism for `` free market , european style economy '' , i admit that . 
  if you think it 's not capitalism , then i guess i see your point . 
  dude .
