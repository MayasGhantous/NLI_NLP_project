  why are the poorest countries having the highest ownership rates ? 
  last year 's riots were a lot better . 
  i was disappointed this time . 
  i hoped for a great show : /, 
  also , nobody ever seriously thought about egypt , lebanon or syria actually joining the eu . 
  ukraine is different . 
  we want them in , they may want in , but for that to happen a lot have to change . 
  that 's pretty one sided but that 's how it is . 
  they had their march . 
  that group [ separated ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9atpxgkuhu ) from the march ( given free pass from organizers ' security ) , ran about 200m and stared at the building for long enough to feel offended ( i guess 3 seconds is enough ) . 
  the squat is n't even visible from the march route . 
  yeah , there are videos of said building bullying a pregnant woman , hitting her in the stomach and calling her names . 
  the boys had just a healthy reaction of throwing a molotov at said building . 
  i would n't be so sure about that irony . 
  right . 
  because flaring up reichstag worked so well the last time !, 
  ^ ( couldnt help myself ), 
  that 's a running joke that the poles ' migrating to the british isles are actually staging an invasion . 
  `` zgodnie z planem '' means `` all according to plan '' which reminded me of this ridiculous custom of anime translators who leave out some japenese words , perfectly eligible for literal translation , and add this kind of `` exlaination '' like in the picture . 
  i combined both memes and boom . 
  a joke . 
  [ zgodnie z planem ] ( http://www.playeronepodcast.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/keikaku.jpg ), 
  that sounds as a great respons to the question from the article . 
  what does poland want ? 
  more of the same plox, 
   but . . but , we 're getting better not [ according to the ef ] ( http://www.ef.pl/epi/analysis/ef-epi-trends/ ) !, 
  as for `` extorting money '' ( sorry about the term ) , i was referring to france using all the diplomatic leverage to allocate as much cash as possible to common agricultural policy because they are the [ biggest beneficiary ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/cap2004beneficiaries.gif ) . 
  i remembered this from times when there were ongoing negotiations about the next eu budget . 
  but it 's the same in all the other countries !, 
  kids make of fun of everyone !, 
  naah , i do n't agree . 
  if we 're talking electropunk there 's france way , way ahead of everyone . 
  they do n't want to learn english . 
  there 's apparently some kind of divide between parisians and other french . 
  they stamped out all of the regional languages , like occitan or breton . 
  they have wonderful cuisine . 
  they use eu to extort money to subsidise their agriculture . 
  they were once a strategic ally to poland-lithuania . 
  edit : wow , sorrry french guys , that are just some things that come to my mind when i think of france . 
  i do not claim it 's accurate , these are just my impressions . 
  feel free to correct all that you think is wrong . 
  that also might change with current rate of migration :p, 
  um , i do n't think that negotiations with ukraine are * slowed * by it 's recent beef with russia . 
  if anything , imo , they * started * because of it . 
  i do n't think there was any serious talk of ukraine 's membership in the eu , like , 3 years ago . 
  anyhow , i agree , moldova and georgia face different set of obstacles to their inclusion in the eu and the fact that we managed to attract ukraine to leave the russian ecosystem ( to mutual benefit , i believe ) is rather a success of eastern partnership than a failure . 
  so minimums are about the same , then . 
  strange . 
  average wage in poland is ~ 3,8 k pln brutto , thats about 660 eur netto . 
  i guess this is because of bigger population , so we have more people taking advantage of it , earning more money . 
  edit : i should calrify : this `` average wage '' is mainly a statistical anomaly . 
  most people here do n't make this kind of money . 
  the median wage is well below the average , unfortunately . 
  i 'm blaming the population size for it , there 's just more opportunity to exploit people when there 's more of them . 
  dude . 
  but it 's oslo . 
  you 've got , like 10x higher wages than here  . 
  now i 'm jealous . 
  i 'm paying 450e for a 50m apartment . 
  but i thought hungary have similar average wage to poland ? 
  what 's minimum wage then ? 
  i do n't think he means 1,4 k per month . 
  it 's 1,4 k for 3 and a half month . 
  400 euros for month , average . 
  i do n't think you could rent an apartment and live comfortably for that kind of money in hungary . 
  or , you know , independent . 
  this might be a shock for a russian . 
  does this even cross your mind ? 
  i feel that every education policy would be better than one implemented by people eating shoe polish , cause they think it 's chocolate . 
  um , i do n't think i 'm getting excited . 
  so , you mean the streets ? 
  as in , town streets ? 
  that 's the original belarussian flag that belarussians elected for themselves before the autocrat seized power and places that riddiculous , crazy , central-asia style communist flagellaganza . 
  where were you and what were you lacking ? 
  i guess poland 's infrastructure is n't as well maintained as in the west , but i would n't say it 's `` very rudimentary '' . 
  let 's see : - water and drainage -- works everyhere - heating -- works everywhere , we 've got surplus - power -- the grid is being pushed to the limits , but works nonetheless , no blackouts whatsover - roads -- the western part is in good shape . 
  the east is bad . 
  - trains -- ok , that part sucks - air transport -- every major city got an airport and a new passenger terminal . 
  i 'm not aware of any shortcomings . 
  so , what 's your problem with the infrastructure ? 
  it could use some funding , but what 's so `` very rudimentary '' ? 
  actually , this particular tank is [ thought ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/czo%c5%82g_w_al._zwyci%c4%99stwa_w_gda%c5%84sku ) to be a communism relic , and a symbol of an army unit specialized in combating polish anti-soviet resistance after the war . 
   but not the actual soldiers who probably did n't carry out rape in gdansk really ? 
  who carried out the rapes , then ? 
  commanders themselves ? 
  all of it ? 
  look , i get that not every single one of soviet soldiers was a raping beast . 
  but some of them were . 
  and the sheer scale of rape crimes on the trail of soviet army tell us what the proportions were like . 
   if it was n't for the red army not only would poland not exist anymore but polish culture and ethnicity would be erased . 
  and that 's also a fact . 
  that 's not a fact . 
  it 's entirely up to debate , and i think that while soviet contribution to fight nazi germany was the highest , the third reich would have fallen anyway , to the western allies . 
   we do n't really know how massive they were , but yes , they sure happened . 
  we kind of have an [ idea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_liberation_of_poland ) : `` in the first six months of 1945 , only in d\u0119bska ku\u017ania 268 rapes were reported . 
  in march 1945 near racib\u00f3rz , 30 women captured at a linen factory were locked in a house in makowo and raped over a period of time under the threat of death . '', 
  go extrapolate for yourself . 
   so what you want to do , and the creator of this statue , is replace the memory of victory and freedom the conquest of poland of 1945 has nothing to do with freedom . 
  there was no freedom in poland until the soviet forces were driven out of here in 1993 . 
  it 's riddiculous to even suggest that .
