  is that some form of calculation to always go with the opposite ideologies ? 
  sld is socialist/liberal , po is whatever-balances-the-budget / whatever-gets-the-most-votes , pis is socialist/convervative , psl is nepotism/conservative , rp is a joke , knp is korwin/korwin adn there 's really nothing left . 
  well , and some people just feel more silesian . 
  i do n't know if you'ever been to upper silesia , but the region and the people are significantly different than in the rest of poland . 
  this shows , and therefore , they developed their own identity . 
  they certainly do n't want to secede from poland , their identity is a lot younger than kashubian and a lot more similar to polish , but it 's separate . 
  it really is , it is n't just some regional patriotism . 
  haha , yeah . 
  stupid flag thieves :p, 
  that 's obviously just `` chleb ze smalcem '' :p tastes fantastically with a sour cucumber . 
  okay , but once they do it it does n't matter if 1 or a million people use that antenna . 
  there 's no significant per user cost . 
  it 's not like it 's especially expensive to offer data transfer abroad -- they 're just smelling the gold . 
  also , why ask how someone 's doing if you do n't want to hear about it ? 
  you want to greet , you say `` hello '' . 
  why the useless question ? 
  first time in my life someone mentions vodka and thinks of shots , not bottles . 
  how strange . 
  invert the ratio unless you want your stomach contents to be ejected . 
  ukraine . 
  it 's a helluva big country and it would be interesting to hear some opinions/facts . 
  yeah , i 'd love some insider info about russia . 
  do n't get so fucking funny . 
  where 's my fucking cocaine !, 
  yeah , we poles do , too !, 
  we 're invited too , right ? 
  right ? 
  i tried that , too . 
  except i live in a country in which you can buy beer anytime , so the 'em ergencies ' were every time and i just ended up resupplying in the middle of the night , like before . 
  i ca n't really delay my rewards :(, 
  do n't they have this special alcohol shops that close early so no one could buy a whiskey at night ? 
  here in poland if i want to continue drinking i always can go to a gas station and buy overpriced liquor there . 
  it 's hard to buy alcohol in sweden . 
  they 've got a working welfare state . 
  their society is not very divided , politically or economically . 
  their social solutions often work well . 
  they export wood , furniture , gritty detective stories and cheesy metal bands . 
  so , we 're passing as `` rich '' , now ? 
  nice . 
  i do n't feel any wealthier , though  . 
   the country is not exactly poor , but not really poland either . 
  what, 
  to rent a 1 bedroom studio in wroclaw you need about 250 euro ( you could get a single room for 200 , too ) . 
  probably another 200 ~ 250 for food , maybe 150 if you 're frugal . 
  so yeah , that 's your survival . 
  forget smartphones , xboxes , forget cinema , theatre . 
  if you 're working a minimum wage job in poland , you 're gon na have a dull life . 
  no wonder that people just buy a football match ticket for 5e and smack each other in the face for entertainment . 
  do you think homosexuality is a socially dangerous deviation ? 
  in what ways does it endanger society ? 
   chechen ftfy, 
  i do n't know . 
  the actual political climate may or may not be entirely different , but is n't the alignment same ? 
  does n't current ukrainian government orientate the country pro russia ? 
  last thing i heard from them was promoting russian language and stopping the state support for ukrainian . 
  i mean , lukashenka has his disagreements with kreml , too , but it 's still more aligned towards it . 
  i do not have any source , but it is common : think republicans in the us . 
  same happens in poland , where the rural people votes conservative right wing , city people vote centre-right wing and hipsters vote left . 
  do n't you have a similar categories in czech rep ? 
  well , the clone-backup plan proved itself useful ^ first ^ potato ^ died ^ in ^ smolensk ^ plane ^ crash ^ p.s. 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ still ^ ^ too ^ ^ soon, 
  sure . 
  i just set it myself ( i think ) . 
  thanks !, 
  sure , `` europe '' should not be synonymous with `` the eu '' . 
  but the eu is still the biggest european entity and most of european reddit users come from there . 
  that 's why we hear so much about it . 
  even people outside the eu might be affected by the decision that are made inside . 
  so the eu should stay an important topic here , in / r/europe . 
  that being said , this subreddit is dedicated to all europeans and nobody should have to feel excluded . 
  maybe we should change the alien . 
  but i do n't think we got any more universal europe symbol that the flag . 
  after all , it 's symbolic for the unification of all of the continent -- it might be impossible due to politics but that 's the goal . 
  yah , cuz they 'll think things we do n't like !, 
  i 'd say that czech silesia would be the common one . 
  edit : [ this one ] ( http://www.vexilla-mundi.com/poland/lower_silesian_flag.png ) would be accepted , too . 
  how about [ silesia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesia ) ? 
  well , there are also belarus , ukraine and russia east of the iron curtain and i do n't think they describe themselves as anything other than eastern europe . 
  meanwhile , the countries you mentioned are significantly different than belarus , ukraine and russia and to lump them together in a bag called `` eastern europe '' is not helpful -- nor geographically accurate . 
  you dutch in christiania are really crazy !, 
  yeah , but he 's not german . 
  that 's the best keyboard layout . 
  why ca n't i find any decent keyboard with this layout ? 
  small backspaces , small enters everywhere . 
  weird places for '' \\ '' . 
  ** why **, 
  just press ctrl-shift . 
  your os will kindly swap z and y on your keymap ;p i find it hilarious when i read a post somewhere in polish web and the poor author has his z 's and y 's swapped . 
  he was probably mad as shit . 
  i also taught all my family that they do n't need to call me if their keyboard writes `` y '' instead of a `` z '' . 
  just press ctrl + shift . 
  ozora looks like heaven on earth . 
  i used to like open ` er ( gdynia , poland ) , but i grew out of it . 
  it 's kind of similar to what you described -- a mix of rock , pop , indie , world music and maybe experimental , sometimes . 
  i now prefer audioriver festival , also in poland , in p\u0142ock . 
  at the bank of vistula there is a steep slope and a rather large beach . 
  on this beach there are several stages playing various kinds of electronic music . 
  a straight road leads up the hill and into the city market square . 
  the beach , the road and the city are all in the fiestival , decorated and filled with music and dancing people . 
  p\u0142ock is a small-ish , old but well preserved town so when it 's occupied by dancing crowds it looks really nice and vibrant .
