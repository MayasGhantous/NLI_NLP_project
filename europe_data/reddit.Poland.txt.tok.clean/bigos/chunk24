  big names attend sometimes , too . 
  hey , that 's pretty catchy !, 
  also , rainy , cold and contains brits . 
  i was thinking , like , australia . 
  it 's far from poland and has great weather . 
  just take your wrinkly queen out of there and i 'm set !, 
  i have hopes to emigrate :p, 
  but what i ca n't wrap my head around is why would they picture merkel of all people ? 
  i mean , it was n't her who directed that series , it is n't like she could make the show not air . 
  i do n't think they 'd be happy with german leader directly controlling the media either . 
  i mean , wtf do you expect , right-wing dickheads ? 
  these people have xenophobia issues . 
  i 'd recommend that no one took them seriously if they did n't have about 30 % support and rising . 
  um , why do you think that `` czarny '' is offensive ? 
  yep , exactly what i had in mind . 
  it 's a snack of the gods . 
  the godsnack . 
  imagine meat crisps . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm so going to do this . 
  beef jerky is 3euros per 25g here , if i can make my favorite snack by kilos and in 6hrs ... 
  i 'm set . 
  edit : for some reason i thought the meat has to be dried in californian sun or something , but screw it my oven 's the same, 
  and australia is simply located on a territory that was once part of british empire  , but yeah , it might be seen as stretch , alright . 
  remove kebab from premises, 
  we like ukrainians and invite them to the eu and cheer at their democratisation efforts . 
  we 're slightly annoyed by of belarus , but still would prefer them to convert . 
  a lithuanian will be pissed off for mentioning lithuania in this post :p, 
  *** h o w *** ^ how ^ how ^ tellme, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics have fun !, 
  we still find it in poland all the time . 
  hardly news material , imo . 
  also , lithunians have their version , too . 
  looks like lithuanized version of polish `` kozlowski '' . 
  they did n't even have dragons , duuh . 
  yeah , me too . 
  especially since i 'm in wroc\u0142aw , probably the next city to break the barrier . 
  i hope that 'd be reflected in my salary :p, 
  like they give a fuck . 
  it 's just insane how this mediterrean cultures ( and their legacies ) expanded to the whole world . 
  i do n't think there 's a place on earth where people do n't know any word that came from ancient greek or latin . 
  including the very names of their own continents . 
  this alphabet looks like it 's straight from skyrim . 
  i 'd watch a reality show that stars a young , sheltered brit traveling to , say tomsk , russia and trying to make a living among the statues of stalin . 
  would be so funny . 
  it 's a blasphemy you did n't mention \u0141om\u017ca . 
  i 'm an avid fan of that beer . 
  i literally ca n't believe that such a tasty beer could be sold for about 3z\u0142 . 
  the best \u0141om\u017ca experience is of course [ \u0141om\u017ca pszeniczne ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--35zf-enzau/t6k4gxnhxoi/aaaaaaaacmi/mxgoohk3kes/s1600/img_9755.jpg ) - a white beer . 
  second best would be [ \u0141om\u017ca niefiltrowane ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctr8i-l3wzwoiip3qeqxvk1rrss6oodquav0o4mbpf9yl3pis3jmq ) - unfiltered kind . 
  for your standard lager just go for [ \u0141om\u017ca ] ( http://www.podlaskie.strefabiznesu.pl/sites/default/files/imagecache/465x300/lomza_export_niepasteryzowane_puszka_05_800_600.jpg ) [ niepasteryzowane ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrq5wbebdekfczkr_h1zjzd_zuq5w_5jitfhdoce4ggk1ncen7ooa ) - this one is unpasteurized . 
  this beats every single one variety of best selling polish beers . 
  no \u017bywiec / tyskie/lech could even match . 
  and it 's surprisingly cheap . 
  try it . 
  umm , the temperature does n't go any higher than 5c . 
  is that what you call `` nice '' , you freaky icemen ? 
  the fact that 's it 's a joke does n't mean it does n't have the right to be registered . 
  from the law perspective , it 's the same as catholic church . 
  do n't see why should it be treated any different . 
  actually , his post is relevant . 
  two witness experts that court ( the registration case was resolved in court ) asked for opinion in that matter said something just along these lines . 
  that pastafrianism is * clearly * a joke religion , and therefore they recommend not to register it . 
  they did n't provide a reason * why * they consider pastafrianism a joke religion nor why catholicism is n't a joke religion . 
  forcing the official court to produce and publish such document is a major victory for the church and pastafrians for itself . 
  but now they 're taking a step further . 
  [ here ] ( http://kosciol-spaghetti.pl/pliki/ekspertyza.pdf ) is the expert witnesses opinion . 
  they are two jagiellonian university professors from religion science institute . 
  if we do n't count russia as europe , that is . 
  thanks !, 
  as far as polish wiki covers , the middle ages wends were slavic tribes that later got absorbed by the germans and poles . 
  not to confuse with antiquity wends , who are probably different people . 
  poland here , i 'll add some interesting names if they differ from english : * czechy - czech rep * s\u0142owacja [ swoh-vatz-ia ] - slovakia * ukraina [ oo-kra-eena ] - ukraine * bia\u0142oru\u015b [ bee-ah-wo-ru-sh ] - belarus * litwa [ litva ] - lithuania * niemcy - germany * szwecja [ shvetzya ] - sweden * szwajcaria [ shvei-tzar-ya ] - switzerland * w\u0119gry [ ven-grie ] - hungary * holandia - the netherlands ( til , we just chose one region to name a country ) * \u0141otwa [ wo-tva ] - latvia * w\u0142ochy [ vwo-hee ] - italy * czarnog\u00f3ra - montenegro * hiszpania [ hishpania ] - spain * anglia - england, 
  do you have a name for poles in * suomi * ? 
  i mean , russians are east slavs , goddammit , we 're the biggest of the westies ;p, 
  thanks , this video cleared that up !, 
  ... or , will be removed from premises :p, 
  what 's the difference between `` the netherlands '' and `` holland '' ? 
  in polish we 're just saying `` holandia '' . 
  so , you 're actually getting aid from your parents , and do n't work ? 
  what if they cut you off ? 
  what if their wealth is lost ( in some random way , like a natural disaster or bank going bankrupt ) . 
  do n't you think it 's probable that you 'd be against cuts for stipends ? 
  you 're a young person with no work nor personal wealth , which is pretty normal for people your age , and therefore it not unlikely that you think you should be getting aid for your education . 
  anyway , the guy was offering help . 
  this is not offensive . 
  he was initiative about it . 
  again , not offensive . 
  he assumed you were poor . 
  nothing wrong with that , too ( why would such assumption be offensive ? ) . 
  why are you offended ? 
  do you work ? 
  does n't england 's name come from the people called angles ? 
  like , `` angles-land '' = england ? 
  hey , we say `` czechy '' , that 's basically the same as `` czechia '' ;p, 
  i think we have an air patrolling mission with lithuania , latvia and ( maybe ) estonia . 
  i do n't think that common armed forces with ukraine are happening anytime soon , though . 
  they are n't nato nor eu . 
   but then , playing the wall does n't make you an old fart . 
  it hopefully never does .
