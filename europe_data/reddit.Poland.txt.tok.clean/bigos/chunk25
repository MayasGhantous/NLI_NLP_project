  i think i got some bad news for ya, 
   chrome can only achieve this with an extension that 's not true , chrome had this feature for a long time . 
  it 's working [ well ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xdb2znv.png ) , i think . 
  what 's more important , chrome also has other uses for its address bar : unrecognized string is being automatically googled for , it has tab completion for known search ( e.g. 
  you type `` ud '' , press tab , and you type anything you want to search for on urbandictionary.com . 
  opera also has this function ) . 
  i have wikipedia , urbandictionary , the pirate bay and several other sites defined as such searches - very useful . 
  i think firefox lacks this feature out of the box . 
  what ? 
  what does it have that chome lacks ? 
  i think even opera has a better address bar than ff , this thing is just useless . 
  but will it blend ? 
  i did n't know about the mobile app . 
  it 's great . 
  at last , some scientific data for those drunk , overnight discussions . 
   swearing , shooting and use of cocaine , that it was something that was n't really an actual thing oh , you filthy socialist sheltered european !, 
  ouch , really ? 
  how about a story , if that 's not a problem ? 
  also no crazy food industry reforms followed with crippling famines . 
  that would help , too . 
  yeah , sure , i hope it 's clear i 've been joking  . 
  i hope , too . 
  for two reasons exactly : 2 . least imporant : it will bring ukraine closer to europe and further from russia , strenghten we western side of the country and open a huge market for european companies ( om nom nom ) 1 . 
  we 'll be ready to import taranka and obolon finally , and they will finally be available in every store as it should be, 
  he was . 
  he was an authoritarian figure . 
  all of popes are . 
  pi\u0142sudski cult is quite uncomprehensible for me in modern poland . 
  this was the guy , who conflicted us with every neighbouring country , he built prison camps that jailed the opposition , he did a fucking coup d'etat . 
  it was andrzej lepper with a machine gun , complete with a wild mustache . 
  politically , he was a representant of the popular sort of statesman at the time - an equivalent to horthy , hitler , mussolini , quisling and whoever . 
  i get that he gets respect for winning 1920 war , but come on . 
  i thought the reason we got democracy is that we 'll never end up with a guy like him . 
  can you imagine a modern polish prime minister who collaborates with polish minority in lithuania to raise a polish uprising in vilnius and then sends a fucking army and incorporates the land ? 
  wtf . 
  well , no . 
  but this article 's headline author seems to think it does . 
  more like from the greco-persian wars of 5th century bc . 
   marry my friends whore i see what you did there \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  0,5 / 10 and only because i read it, 
  is n't the title kind of misleading ? 
  i do n't know , from what i read it seems that our exports will * grow * at a second highest rate . 
  that 's really similar to the natonalist movements in poland right now . 
  all the same : the celtic cross , the protests , no party , undemocratic ... 
  i wonder if it 's europe-wide thing . 
  i hope it wo n't catch on , though . 
  pasztet reporting in, 
  ca n't we just bash it with a bridge ? 
  on the other hand , in this case there 's no meat left ... 
  ah , fellow dwarf fortress player . 
  the loud brits are loud in english . 
  the germans are invisible , and yet there are loads of them ( from municipal tourism statistics ) . 
  there are loads of german tourists in my city ( wroclaw used to be important german city so it attracts a lot of german tourists ) and they are absolutely no trouble . 
  they ride the trams and buses and drink in bars and i ca n't tell them apart from locals unless they speak . 
  occasional british stag parties or middle-easterners from foreign exchange are much worse : loud and seeking trouble . 
  why would n't the danes/swedes cut the middlemen and come directly to poland ? 
  it 's fairly close , we 've got some ferry connections !, 
  ( i 've been to bornholm myself , yay !, 
  is high german/low german division like high elves/low elves division ? 
  except germans are obviously orcs ? 
  ouch . 
  could ' t you disable roaming ? 
  he 's john . 
  i would generally trust eurostat , but this looks ** so wrong ** it is n't even funny . 
  we really really pay ** more ** for imorted electronics , software etc. 
  people are driving to germany to buy cheaper things all the time -- it 's not a delusion , it 's just a better deal . 
  i ca n't say a thing about food prices but electronics is absolutely another deal and i 'm adamant that we need to come up with more money to buy the same things . 
  maybe there 's something wrong with their methodology or something . 
   why do n't you prove me wrong instead ? 
  i just did . 
  to counter a statement that is in form of `` all x-es are in relationship y with zs '' it is enough to point out one x that is not in y with one of the zs . 
  polish nexus 7 is ** not cheaper ** than german nexus 7 . 
  these eurostat charts contradict everything i see every day . 
  i just bought nexus 7 3g for $ 460 and that 's only price you could get buying in poland , while the normal price from google is $ 299 . 
  it is like that with ** everything ** , i challenge you to find an electronic device that 's cheaper in poland than in the uk or us . 
  go on . 
  try . 
  your feelings are not compatibile with urban planner 's experience anywhere . 
  what you wrote about something being `` culturally wrong '' is borderline fascist and ultimately stupid . 
  there 's no thing in the world that could be described as `` culturally wrong '' , these words do n't even go together in a sentence . 
  second , i do n't know where you got this idea that we need `` more active , competitive , challenging , more masculine , higher-adrenaline culture '' . 
  i do n't see how such culture ( somehow attained by allowing faster driving ( ?! ) ), 
  is desirable , or how does it bring us more peace , wealth or equality . 
  if anything , i 'd say it causes the opposite . 
  third , even if we say we want what you describe as `` buzz '' ( lol ) , i do n't see how road deaths might lead to that . 
  let me tell you what does higher speed roads mean : - ** noise ** - and this is the most important thing . 
  faster vehicles generate unproportionately louder noise . 
  this is a major problem in the cities , where people continously live in a sound polluted enviroment . 
  it 's almost always overlooked and nobody mentions that living in noisy enviroment is a ** health hazard ** weakening immunity system , raising stress levels , destroying sleep patterns etc. 
  this is a ** major ** life quality hit . 
  - pollution - cars generate an absurd amount of pollution . 
  to the point that the air in the cities * smells * of combusted gasoline . 
  faster driving vehicles generate more pollution . 
  - congestion - there are too many cars already . 
  they just do n't fit in our streets anymore . 
  the naive solution to this problem was widening the road . 
  let 's just build another lane !, 
  this is how you end up with a clusterfuck of the size of atlanta . 
  as it turned out , wider roads just attract more cars and in effect ** decrease ** average vehicle speed , which effectively increases traffic jams and pollution and noise . 
  the correct way is to eliminate or drastically reduce individual transport from places that reach their transport capacity ( dense urban areas , city centers ) and only rely on public transport .
