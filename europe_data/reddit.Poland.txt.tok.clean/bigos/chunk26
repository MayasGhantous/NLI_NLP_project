  - area fragmentation and killing life - nobody want to shop on a highway . 
  nobody want to drink coffee/beer where there are cars 3m from your table . 
  you wo n't go for a walk with your wife and kids on a 1m wide sidewalk by the highway . 
  it would be a tiring nightmare , would n't it ? 
  then why should be build such a nightmare ? 
  cities are for living in them , not for making them a living hell of noise and gasoline reek . 
  also , how do you walk througfh a city that is sliced by autobahn through ? 
  you need to either climb the stairs or deal with the streetlights or cross in an unsafe spot . 
  and his is only annoying if you 're young and healthy single man . 
  what if you 're on a wheelchair ? 
  fuck you , then , no crossing for you , go live your life surronded by four autobahns . 
  what if you 're a single mother with babies ? 
  fuck you , too , hopefully your kids get under a truck , right ? 
  fuck them , and their unhealthysinglemanly way of life . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.latortugaviajera.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/prague-street.jpg ) is how european cities need to look - and it 's only way that work in densely populated areas . 
  otherwise you end up with your [ culturally-right ] ( http://paviavio.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/beijingtrafficjam2.jpg ) , [ dynamic ] ( http://www.djethemusicmaster.com/city%20of%20atlanta.jpg ) , [ high-adrenaline ] ( http://www.jetsetz.com/uploads/profiles/atlanta-flights_1.jpg ) , [ masculine ] ( https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcslcnwg9xhsc8ezmdgowjnkyw52xmlqd6ort-mgtbdtvhw8rdx - ) , [ energetic ] ( https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctomyjfmt9u787xqvrjsmok6hvptf_k7kjyq9f7typldd7y3ntj ) and [ fucking dead ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcsl23iptgmh_gfxaf14oxucq1knc9govbf-apekegumjwgqztu ) [ usa ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctnsgrzhs9ypshblne1w1f_xtska1ovr2mczp8ef1kbexd0rbgx ) cities , where you ca n't even go for a beer without a designated driver . 
  this is utterly stupid . 
  go to atlanta for a year . 
  see how it it to live in a car-friendly enviroment . 
  move to copenhagen next . 
  move back to atlanta 6 . 
  reread wha you wrote here . 
  be amazed by your own short sight 8 . 
  there 's no point four . 
  i think we poles are going to dominate this thread :p for some reason we get ** the worst ** architecture . 
  i challenge thee with [ solpol ] ( http://wiezowce.blox.pl/resource/800pxwroclawsolpol_ulswidnicka.jpg ) , standing in the middle of wroc\u0142aw 's most prestigious street , [ surrounded ] ( http://i574.photobucket.com/albums/ss190/renomaraz/obraz440.jpg?t=1242667585 ) by opera house , an old church and beautiful tenement houses . 
  battlestar galactica reference in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  he looks like he 's got an idea what to do with what he sees . 
  annoying foreigners might be interesting . 
  annoying locals are fucking plague . 
  . . should be revoked if you drive after drinking dwa piwa !, 
  this is just a scouting party . 
  prepare for invasion . 
  i see that polish-lithuanian commonwealth refused to disclose the data :p, 
  perfect troll . 
  if so , why land owning is ok according to libertarians ? 
  land is natural resource that 's needed to feed the people and yet , every libertarian i meet is against nationalizing it . 
  why is land different from water ? 
  or why is food different than water in that matter ? 
  no poland has best women ** and beer ** checkmate, 
  are you kidding me, 
   near abroad see , that 's why you ca n't have nice things . 
  that 's really cheap . 
  cling to this flat because you could not find another one in this price . 
  i do n't know man , i only tried such cheap accomodation twice and it was horrible . 
  the first flat was with some blue collar untermenschen snorting amphetamine every other day and coming into my room without knocking while i 'm in the middle of sweet sex . 
  scarred me for life . 
  the second time i could n't go out at night because public transportation did n't reach that part of the city . 
  it was literally in the middle of nowhere . 
  on the plus side it was in the walking distance to my workplace so it was bearable . 
  anyway , i 'm done with being cheap about the flat i rent - 800z\u0142 is the minimum you need to pay to live in a medium standard . 
  and certainly you wo n't find a studio for 1000z\u0142 in wroc\u0142aw . 
  it just is n't there . 
  1200 + bills is more like it , and only if you like roaches . 
  ~ 400zl for a room for one ? 
  where 's that ? 
  in wroc\u0142aw the best you could hope for is 550-600z\u0142 but you 'll end up traveling 30-50min to the market square/your school . 
  and expect to be cold in winter or pay megabills for gas heating . 
  it 's easy , the only ones that get to pick up the opposite sex are the ones with their own place  . 
  i can tell you that in poland living with your parents is an economical necessity more often than not . 
  renting a single room is 200 euros in biggest cities and the minimum wage netto is 300 and that 's only if you work full time . 
  people who can afford to rent do it and people with real work contracts ( who are the only ones with credit ability and there 's like 40 % of them in the young adult workforce ) often get mortgages and are able to live on their own . 
  if not for the financial reasons i bet the polish percentage would be a lot , lot less . 
  it 's interesing as we poles see that as a inherently bad thing , and portuguese in other thread treat this thing as a valuable cultural trait . 
  to us , living too long with out parents is economical necessity , not something that we think ** should ** be done . 
  just one day , every year . 
  if you strolled around the centre of the city you live in , chances are that a team of collectors with a cardboard can ( with a ** seal ** , this is important as there are sometimes scams ) would approach you and offer a heart for any contribution . 
  altough , these days people often just send a bank transfer , or text message to a special number . 
  your red border should be further east . 
  czech , slovakia and western poland certainly have more similarities to the western europe than to orthodox rus . 
  makes sense , as poland was part if austria-hungarian empire , 
  here 's more [ info ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_orchestra_of_christmas_charity ) . 
  it 's a yearly , nation wide event that millions of people participate in . 
  the medical hardware bought by them is seen in almost every hospital in poland , thousands of people are being trained in er . 
  almost everyone in the country contributes and companies are fighting or the honor to be the highest contributor . 
  i 'd say it 's one of the greates charity events ever . 
  wait , who does n't want to be cee ? 
  we certainly are and want to !, 
  there are a few [ contenders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe ) :d, 
  i smirked at `` land x '' :p, 
  this particular bunch lived around the french for a time . 
  he was very interested in describing polish nation , it 's history and mythos . 
  this is nationalistic enough for me . 
  although i know he was an intellectual man with broad knowledge and interests i find his obsession with `` polishness '' unhealthy and obnoxious . 
  in fact , i prefer [ poczekalnia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltc97lojaji ) , [ zbroja ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcxeu2ivt0c ) and [ mufka ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3xnqrvtdsa )  . 
  of course i speak polish , i 'm a native  . 
  i know kaczmarski and i know this song . 
  i just wish all of it 's content would disappear ( as well as this wife-beating , nationalistic alcoholic ) . 
   for one , you 're not expected to do anything . 
  that is not correct . 
  every political force that styles itself `` patriotic '' is adamant about the idea that only `` true '' member of their tribe are worthy of having any political rights . 
  hell , try to state that you do n't really care about < insert_country  and get elected to any office . 
  being a patriot is a hidden assumption and a hidden requirement . 
  being a patriot also make you extremenly short sighted and limited only to member of your tribe . 
  in essence , i think that this layer of `` nation '' in a hierarchy between `` my circles '' --  `` my nation '' --  `` humanity '' consisnt of one element not needed . 
  if you 're going to care about a broad community , be it everyone one the planet , and not only < insert_nationality  . 
  there are also things that make any ( and all of them together ) nationality revolting : founding myths , `` national features '' , stereotypes , ethnic conflicts and also said impractical inability to divide peacfully . 
  i always remember that when i hear about polish children unable to learn in polish schools because they are lithuanians , or silesian kids ridculed at school because they speak `` a dialect '' . 
   is having friends or family unethical , too ? 
  having friends and family is fine -- you always could choose not to have them in your life .
