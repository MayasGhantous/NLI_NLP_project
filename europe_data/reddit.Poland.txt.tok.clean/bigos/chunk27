  but i am unable to get rid of ` the nationality ' because other people perceive me through it . 
  i ca n't just move to australia like i would to germany -- there are political processes that make that harder for me , and these processes are largely based on tribal politics . 
  the fact that i might refuse nationalism does n't really change my life , as it is largely defined by what other people perceive . 
  we could have lived in a perfectly unified european state by now , if it were n't for these damned nationalists . 
   i do n't want europe to be souless uniform blob of same-thinking europeans . 
  see , that 's exactly what some of us want . 
  to unite . 
  european identity is better , because it 's broader . 
  global identity is even better and no identity is the best . 
  to me , nationalism , patriotism and jingoism are just points on a scale of `` tribal commitment '' . 
   why should it fade ? 
  i find it unpractical , for once . 
  nation states are often too small or too big for effective management . 
  it either inhibits growth or squander resources on corruption . 
  in my opinion it is also unethical and nonsensical -- i 'm expected to care about other people who are randomly born in the same territory and happen to speak the same language as me . 
  i 'm expected to prefer them to people from other parts of the world that i have much more in common ( other people in my trade , for example , or other people who use fork to eat ) . 
  and what 's most disgusting , i 'm expected to ** love ** that idea of a nation , that i did n't choose . 
  i am fucking taught that at school . 
  forcing this kind of collectivity on children makes me want to vomit irl . 
  this is also i hate religious indoctrination of children with passion . 
  i understand that idea . 
  i called that `` cut off '' because that how it will be perceived by the people on the territories that might have been partitioned . 
  because this will be seen as partition , something that has a really bad vibe here in poland . 
  you do n't divide lesser poland , greater poland and mazovia into different political entities . 
  you just do n't , or you 're going to get insurection . 
  i know you think that division and regrouping is something fundamentally different than just slicing the country apart . 
  but it is n't and it wo n't work for at least 30 more years in poland . 
  if we 're lucky . 
  maybe it would work if the nationalism fade out - but it does n't seem to , unfortunately . 
  i think the divides you propose might be artificial and as such , provoke a negative reaction . 
  i , too , think that smaller union members would be better , but the division has to be made on existning borders . 
  you probably could cut off bavaria from germany , or silesia / kashubia form poland , because there are people who might want it , but i do n't think you 're going to get brandenburg or mazovia split off their respective countries . 
  it would just create opposition and backfire . 
  if you want an example of terrible pizza , try `` da grasso '' , it 's spread like a plague . 
  order this , then imagine everything on it done ** differently ** and in the end you might have an idea of an italian pizza  . 
  i. . . what ? 
  i do n't disagree with you , i just wanted to set this one issue straight . 
  i 'm really anal about that stuff , because i come from silesia and have studied its history  . 
  i mostly agree with you , but you 've got history of silesia wrong . 
  it was n't * always * german , it was n't even german for a majority of the time . 
  even the name silesia comes from a lechitic ( for simplicity sake , let 's say proto-polish ) tribe of \u015al\u0119\u017canie . 
  it was part of poland for about 300 years since the beginning of kingdom od poland . 
  then , until the war of austrian sucession in 1742 it belonged to the czechs ( kingdom of bohemia ) . 
  only for the `` brief '' 200 years was the silesia german . 
  i just want you to know , that you made me laugh , 
  i agree that this is a dumb statement and i think directed at poles who harbor some kind of resentment against the germans . 
  i just did n't like the tone of your post . 
  `` better shut up or else '' ? 
  that is not reasonable thing to say . 
  i suppose it does n't . . ? 
  but why it is required for kaczynski to remember a bullshit casus belli from ww2 ? 
  are you suggesting that germany is going to attack , and is awaiting convenient justification ? 
  why is it so important , that mr kaczynski ** should ** remember that ? 
  okaay ... why should he remember that , again ? 
  i think it 's per 10,000 or something about that , 
  i agree that a lot of factors that contribute to lower status of eastern poland are independent of each other . 
  i think there still is a major divide . 
  these statistics you quoted show no such divide . 
  and there might not be a divide in these categories . 
  but there still are in another subjects : percentage of people connected with sewage and canalization , number of people in production age , amount of trash per citizen , crime rate ( this is actually lower in the eastern poland ) . 
  i 'm not claiming that the eastern half is the worst , it 's just that this is a stereotype the op asked about . 
  i 'm just saying there is a division -- maybe not a definitive `` pass this border line and you'e in a different country '' kind of division , but a division of some sort . 
  i mean , look at the election scores on the site you linked . 
  this is so iirp shaped it 's not even funny . 
  here 's my take on it : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14llnx/european_countries_and_their_model_regions/c7e81pk, 
  the divide in poland is two-fold : - urban vs rural : as anywhere in the world , people in cities earn more , have better access to jobs and other helpful institutions . 
  polish cities left this post-communist-urban-wasteland-in-transition look behind a few years ago . 
  the big cities are considered motors of polish economy , they are expanding bubbles of civilization and wealth . 
  polish country - not so much , not everywhere . 
  you still get those villages with defunct state run farms that collapsed after 1989 and nobody found any job for the population working there , so these are now dens of alcohol abuse and social degeneration . 
  that 's becoming a rarity , too , forunately , but the more east you move , the more of them you get . 
  which brings me to another divide : - east vs west , aka russian part vs. everyone else . 
  this thing carries from as long before as partitions of poland . 
  if you look at the [ railway connection map ] ( http://kolej.one.pl/mapy/1/1088025256.png ) , [ ngos per capita map ] ( http://www.ngo.pl/files/wiadomosci.ngo.pl/public/wiadomosci_foto_2009/podstawowe_fakty_2008_odc2_mapa3.jpg ) or [ votes for two major political parties map ] ( http://nczas.com/wp-content/gallery/rozklad-glosow-polska-b/rozklad-glosow-polska-b.jpg ) you 'll notice it 's awfully similar to the [ shape ] ( http://www.trystero.pl/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zabory.jpg ) of partitions of poland over modern boundaries . 
  that might let you understand why poles have that negative attitude towards russians , if you ever wondered :p . this shape reappears in multitude of maps -- personal income maps , infrastructue density maps , emigration rate maps , all sorts of it . 
  there 's even a term coined , although not really politically correct , for this right-hand side part of poland : `` poland b '' , often joked around as the `` worse part '' . 
  of course these are all either generalizations or just my impressions , but it might give you some insight for the polish matters . 
  still , people are so surprised . 
  i 'm willing to bet that another 20 years of economic union and free travel zone , and it will become impossible to dismantle the eu . 
  the people will grow too close to each other . 
  [ everthing going as we expected ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/336/249/36f.jpg ) . 
   but we sure do like to make fun of our similar languages haha , yeah !, 
  you 've got some nice ski resorts , too !, 
  also , `` odbyt '' means rectum , `` kupa '' means shit , `` szuka\u0107 '' means `` to seek '' and `` szczotka '' is n't a whore for gods sake , stop being so offensive everywhere !, 
  did you experience a sudden influx of polish tourists this year ? 
  i mean , every other friend of mine was in croatia this year . 
  i seriously wondered if polish is dominant language there for the vacation o_o . 
  on a side note , i really need to go and see these famous waterfalls :d, 
  very informative , thank you !, 
  which is also cool , because `` orszak '' is a polish word , too and with similar meaning -- followers , attendats or even procession . 
  umm ... poles ( or proto-poles ) were known as `` lachy '' long before the legend was made up . 
  it is speculated that this name comes from a name of the tribe `` l\u0119dzianie '' from lesser poland . 
  hence `` lechistan '' , `` lengyel '' and all that . 
  that 's too bad . 
  no positive feeling towards poles in the mass consciousness ? 
  i understand bad feelings from history , but i thought that we get along fine recently . 
  are there any grudges held by the ukrainians or is just the disinterest in a boring neighbour who you think you have little in common ? 
  actually they did , it 's my mistake . 
  the day is 23rd march . 
  both governments declared by acclamation the day of polish-hungarian friendship ( ~ ~ 12th and ~ ~ 23rd march in hungary and poland ~ ~ respectively ~ ~ ) .
