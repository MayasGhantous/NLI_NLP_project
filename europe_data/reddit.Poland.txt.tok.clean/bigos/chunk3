  they want to sit on the fence , for now . 
  if he 's french then it 's an excus\u00e9 . 
   since 996 ** 966 ** . 
  come on , it 's 30 years difference , it 's a whole generation . 
  how would you feel if your grandkids told everyone their grandpa verius ' whole life has been under polish people 's republic ? 
  well , we got refrigerators and cars ... we tought we could improve politics , too , if we tried . 
  yep , this is where the title comes from . 
  medieval slavic states were probably very similar . 
  then the country was divided for wojew\u00f3dztwa , each with it 's own wojewoda . 
  and this tradition is kept to this day , every polish state has wojew\u00f3dztwa . 
  at least it 's not german/russian empire partition map again !, 
  that 's because it 's exactly that . 
  and i love it :d . 
  seriously , despite the widespread opinion that `` polish food is great '' there is only evidence for the opposite . 
  the meat no less overloaded with nitrate and salt ( which is shitty road salt ) than in any other eu country . 
  5 years ago there was a huge scandal about 25 years old cans of meat that were sold here as valid , and god knows how many of these things happen unnoticed . 
  it gets to the point that czech republic publishes special reports about polish food products to individually mark them safe of unsafe . 
  that 's beyond normal russian-style embargo . 
  all in all , there 's a ton of cases where it looks like polish food is mainly shit food and absolutely none that say otherwise \\ ( except for that weird , unexplainable , unfounded belief that everyone 's holding , that polish food is great ) . 
  i know what it is , i lived in gliwice for 15 years . 
  polish kie\u0142basa best kie\u0142basa , all other countries have inferior kie\u0142basa . 
  therefore people prefer to buy polish meat , mostly . 
  it 's not at all because they consider animal welfare important . 
  it 's because meat from poland is considered `` higher quality '' , `` more natural '' , `` with less additives '' than imported meat , and therefore is seen as tastier . 
  to conquer moldova , obviously . 
  no idea what you 're talking about . 
  of course it is . 
  there are many different kinds of socialisms . 
  who do uou think implemented modern european welfare state , the ancaps ? 
   i 'm not saying free healthcare , education and equality are bad . 
  they 're great . 
  but if you want to have guaranteed jobs , you need to have planned economy . 
  so what 's stopping us from having all the benefits and none of the drawbacks ? 
  do you think that planned economy is obligatory in every socialist doctrine ? 
  it 's not . 
  more like pleonasm, 
   should n't of guys , he 's genuine . 
  i thought it 's about dwarf fortress, 
  nowak 's wife is not a public official , she can hide her income all she wants and it 's not counted as governmental corruption . 
  altough nowak pulling strings to hold the inspection was bad enough . 
  he was fired for it , though , so there 's at least this high standard . 
   accursed soldiers or solidarity movement . 
  i really hope people would shut up about those guys at last . 
  yeah , yeah , i get it , they fought that communism thing people hate so much , but puh-lease , compared to bear soldier or winged badasses these boring stories about a ) partisans turned bandits , b ) people with moustaches smoking a lot and playing guitars are bleak at the least . 
  i mean , sure , they are heroes . 
  let me add them to rest of the pack . 
  now can we please skip this ? 
  there 's already way too much hero-worship in polish popculture . 
  i do n't like most of the polish culture as well - polish movies are either utter crap , like the rom-coms , or heavy , gloomy stories about misery and poverty , which i do n't like very much . 
  the literature i do n't follow . 
  the only things that shines through for me is the new polish music - and it gets it 's recognition !, 
  there are some polish metal bands known worldwide , there 's a lot electronic producers that are recognizable , there 's several world music bands that are known worldwide , too . 
  i mean , kapela ze wsi warszawa played at glastonbury couple of years ago , you ca n't get recognized more than that . 
  two weeks ago there was a boiler room session in wroc\u0142aw , the world 's hipster bible broadcasted polish dj 's from polish club . 
  polish music is doing ok . 
  look at your northern neighbour for an example why it 's such a big deal to some people . 
  in poland you could be thrown in jail for possession of the littlest amount possible of any of the controlled substances . 
  like , not even one joint , but if the police finds a ** crumb ** of cannabis in your pocket -- boom -- you 're facing 3 years in prison and it does n't matter if you 're lowlife thug or father of three with a job . 
  and that 's not even working , drug consumption is rising still . 
  it 's just destructive . 
  but the anti-drug propaganda works like a charm so they 're all so opposed to decriminalization , they think it 's a good deed to be opposed to drugs . 
  it does n't even do anything , but people feel better when they are against drugs . 
  was n't budweiser originally czech ? 
  the clouds gave it away . 
  they do n't have clouds in africa . 
  it 's there . 
  right next to a4 highway between katowice-krak\u00f3w . 
  famous spot to mess with your passengers if they do n't know about it . 
  prague to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a omitting wroc\u0142aw ? 
  that 's nonsense . 
  that 's not the fastest route ... 
  cool map , though and thanks for pointing out that sweet subreddit . 
  so was vilnius ' , but as / u/tom1099 said , what 's past is past . 
  well , then the list is wrong , because jagiellonian university in krak\u00f3w was closed at least one time in history . 
  it should be excluded ( and my alma mater [ university of wroc\u0142aw ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/university_of_wroc%c5%82aw ) is next oldest !, 
  i think ) . 
  i do n't know how they do in other countries . 
  it is really prevalent here , and people turn a blind eye on that . 
  maybe other countries have that too , but it 's definetely not a right attitude . 
  they do . 
  they did in all level of my education , and i did it , too . 
  there 's even a special word for it : '' \u015bci\u0105ganie '' ( = `` getting it '' , `` downloading '' ) which is not considered negative , as opposed to actual `` cheating '' ( `` oszukiwanie '' ) which is considered negative . 
  in polish when you cheat on test you just '' \u015bci\u0105gasz '' which is not a big deal !, 
  right ?!, 
  but if you con people for money , that 's `` oszustwo '' , a very bad thing and a crime !, 
  it certainly seems like gearing up for war . 
  all the media propaganda , grand tv shows of ukrainian fascists that set berkut heroes on fire , russian troops amassed at the rus-ukr border , funding and equiping separatists ... 
  it does look like gearing up for war . 
  even sounds like it . 
  i do n't know . 
  whoever . 
  `` they '' . 
  i guess `` they '' would if they could , it probably was n't possible . 
  pity , though . 
  there 's another way . 
  russia shoould not have nuclear weapons . 
  pity they were n't taken away when soviet union fell . 
  we were taught it too , but translated to polish . 
  pretty nice translation , too . 
  yeah , in special camps !,
