  they raise some valid questions about efficiency of the union , and these question need to be addressed . 
  pity , that brits prefer to opt out of the union , instead of trying to fix it . 
  but hey , that 's their choice . 
   i simply do not recognise a sufficiently congruent set of aims and expectations to assent to being governed by the common will of the eu . 
  i do . 
  what do you think would be his bias ? 
  that 's interesting but does n't always work . 
  for example , often it 's france that seizes power and makes a mess ( frank empire , napoleon ) . 
  sometimes it 's russia ( soviet union ) . 
  most of the time germany was fragmented and weak . 
  i think that when we lose interest in one other , we soon will stop be there for each other . 
  `` why should we send our boys to help them , we have nothing in common with them '' . 
  yep , that 's even better explaination . 
  unfortunately . 
  not really , it 's just that previous prices were unreasonably high , because of political conflict . 
  both governments are now aiming to improve relations , so the russians decided to drop the price from fuck-me-thats-rough to just very very high . 
  we always had . 
  but do n't you worry , i could n't differentiate between englad and wales either . 
  ever heard of belarus , ukraine or russia ? 
  yeah , that eastern europe . 
  it 's extensive , and that 's not bad , but it does n't promote specialization and value of education quickly vanishes . 
  cool thing about polish education is not the system , it 's that it 's massive , that everyone tries to get educated . 
  the quality of education is debatable ( it 's hard to be elite when 60 % of youth is studying at universities -- it means that even below average students are getting a degree ) , but nevertheless , educated they are . 
  i do n't think he meant `` orthodox '' as in `` the eastern church '' . 
  more like `` strictly abiding the rules '' . 
  pakistan is more orthodox than romania , although , they 're muslim . 
  itt : a cult warns about other cults . 
   we will put in on trucks and dump right in front of your doorsteps . 
  / s also , shit on it and ring the bell . 
  me too , except i did n't wake up early , so now i feel bad , because i wasted this extra hour :(, 
  sure , sure . 
  i 'm not talking about not being interested in actual facts . 
  i 'm referring to this mythos , this notion of `` being a shiny shield of christianity/european way of life against < insert_infidel_barbaric_hordes  '' . 
  some poles share that view , and nobody in the world is intersted in that passive aggressive self-pity . 
  the history itself is great , i 'm mostly interested in moldova , though . 
  how the romanians view moldova ? 
  i heard there are ( were ? ), 
  talks about uniting the two countries . 
  are moldovians the same as romanians ? 
  do they speak the same language , share the same culture ? 
  do they want to join romania ? 
  ultimately , language and culture is all that is . 
  nations are not in any kind biological entities . 
  genetical similarities and differences are not in the shape of nations ' borders . 
  so , one can argue , if romanians share language and cultural ancestry with romans , then they 're romans as well as italians . 
  i really do n't like how this national idea is ingrained in european culture : / . 
  there 's no `` redditor '' , too , and for the same reason , 
  same mythos is present in poland , but in relation to asian hordes of russia . 
  i can tell you from experience , that nobody in the world gives a shit , except for some lunatic nationalists . 
  in poland ; http://pracuj.pl http://goldenline.pl and of course , linkedin , but you already know that . 
  because `` europhile '' is greek for `` socialist barroso lover '' , right ? 
  i case you did n't notice : it 's not . 
  it means `` europe lover '' . 
  by `` they '' i meant british general public . 
  substantial part of british people is in favour of leaving the eu . 
  first thing that popped out after googling `` support for eu membership britain '' was [ this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220778/most-voters-want-britain-leave-eu-support-pulling-highest-level-30-years.html ) . 
  i know it 's daily mail but it is n't very different from every other poll i 've seen . 
  majority is opposed , about 30 % is pro eu and the rest is undecided . 
  i am not saying to `` kick them out '' or that the uk will `` come crawling back '' . 
  i 'd prefer for the uk to stay in and i 'm not sure if it will hurt them so bad if they left . 
  i am just saying that we , people outside of britain ca n't make the choice for them . 
  if they want out , they 're out . 
  forcing them to stay is only going to generate resentiment . 
  i do n't buy your `` do n't let fools of today spoil the bright future generations '' argument . 
  the majority is always uninformed , and if brexit actually happen , and there will be british come back 10 years after , it will be still uninformed majority making the ( this time different ) choice . 
  it 's not `` just kick them out and wait for them to crawl back '' , it 's `` we ca n't hold them if they want out so badly , but if they want back in , they are unfortunately going to pay for the damage . '', 
     and if we do , should n't we legalize other drugs that are less harmful as well ? 
    of course we should . 
  they never should have been made illegal in the first place . 
   really ? 
  you 'd legalize heroin and crystal meth ? 
  really ? 
  heroin and crystal meth ** less harmful ** than marijuana ? 
  these substances are highly addictive , much more so than marijuana and also have much greater impact on users ' systems . 
  i 'm pro complete legalization of every drug , too , but if we 're talking about legalizing soft drugs , why drop heroin and meth in there ? 
  also , czech republic . 
  i ' l never forget my trips to prague , where i could smell weed on every corner , smoked by the yuppies exiting their corp buildings . 
  i never found a shop that sell it , though . 
  well , what else could be done ? 
  they want to opt out of everything . 
  nobody wants them out except for themselves . 
  i do n't know if they come crawling back , maybe they 'll be just fine but we sure ca n't force any country to participate in the eu . 
  to be honest , that 'll take a lot of time and even when it goes to 2:1 , it 's still just a half of it :(, 
  that was in the 60s , so ... yeah, 
  yeah , that 's it . 
  i 'm calling a wykop.pl squad to pick you up . 
   well , do you have data to back that up ? 
  my only data come from this article . 
  the fishermen need artificial buyout to keep the prices up . 
  otherwise , it 's unprofitable for them . 
  therefore , if the buyout did n't happen , the fishermen would not make profit and some of them would drop out of business . 
  this is unfortunate for them but : 1 ) keeps natural resource of fish intact , 2 ) keeps a lot of money in eu 's pocket . 
  right now we are only financing waste . 
  but ... what are you implying ? 
  that if we strip fishermen of their aid and stop funding unnecessary fishing we will some day wake up in a world , where fish are expensive , because the demand went up and the supply ca n't deliver ? 
  is that what you 're saying ? 
  because if it is i think it 's preferable to wasting 17 million kgs of fish which also depletes natural resources . 
  stability of the fish market ** is not ** critical and should only be regulated in a manner that takes care of enviroment , not the workers . 
  plus , i think that if someday the demand should rise , there will quickly appear additional fisheries and fish businesses ( or current , efficient businesses expand ) . 
  i do n't think we need to maintain aritificial market supply for something that does n't call for it .
