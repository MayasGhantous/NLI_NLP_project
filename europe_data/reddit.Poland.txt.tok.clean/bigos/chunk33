  i do n't and i never said that . 
  you 're confusing me with the other guy . 
  clearly , you do not even read the sources you 're pasting : `` only 10 percent of the nearly 30,000 known fish species have been evaluated for inclusion in the iucn red list of threatened species '' so , how the hell do you know how many fish ** species ** are endangered ? 
  why are n't you on wykop.pl anyway ? 
  it 's not about keeping ** markets ** profitable . 
  it 's about keeping fishermen content and employed . 
  which is wrong , because they 're not needed . 
  well , the jews in poland were also a native population . 
  they were polish citizens , too . 
  it 's not like they immigrated recently , or something . 
  my mother 's family comes from around a totally jewish town of 20,000 . 
  that was before the war . 
  after , the town was taken by poles . 
  sure , there were pogroms , and the jews were also kind of opressed in 1930s by right-wing freaks who had the power then . 
  there were also assholes who hid jews and extorted all they money because they had an advantage . 
  but history is convoluted and sometimes you end up with characters like this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopold_socha this guy rescued several people and hid them in the sewers just because he wanted them to pay him . 
  but as the time progressed , the jews ran out of money , and this guy continued to help them even after all the money he previously extorted went dry . 
  the jews survived . 
  he died several days after the war end , hit by a soviet truck . 
  most [ righteous among the nations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/righteous_among_the_nations ) were ( are ) poles . 
  it 's not like poles are a nation of saints , but they 're are n't all assholes , too . 
  like everywhere else . 
  it 's just because the conditions were so much more extreme than anywhere else in europe you get so many extreme cases . 
  well , do n't . 
  no one asks you to stop using german . 
  i 'd just like you to speak english as well , so we can communicate . 
  actually , it 's already done . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  maybe uniformity in english does n't really mean what i think it meant . 
  i never really supported driving languages into extinction ( although , if it happens natuarally i do n't consider it a big loss , too ; we 're humans , we 're creating languages as we go , no need to cling to the ones we already have ) . 
  if i had any say in that matter , i 'd decide that everyone in the eu is required to learn english on par with whatever local community chooses as it 's primary language . 
  but that 's just me . 
  uniformity is the greatest friend progress can have . 
  is metric system boring ? 
  maybe so , but it helps a lot in trade . 
  would you rather return to the times when every town had it 's own scale ? 
  enjoy your arguments as you try to convince your customer that these are perfectly fine pounds of whatever do you sell . 
  i sometimes browse german groupon-like sites . 
  if poland had adapted euro i 'd have fairly easier time deciding if i want to buy a tablet from there . 
  also , no bank would rip me off on the exchange rate . 
  all things uniform help with cooperation and i recognize cooperation as the critical factor in civilized society . 
  while we should n't force anyone to use a language , if we are serious about all that `` europe united '' thing , we should promote an uniform type of communication . 
  and the time we 're living kind of suggests that english is the best candidate . 
  it does n't mean it in any way `` the best '' , btw ( omg , i bet i could translate `` you did '' in a sentence in 20 ways into polish , all having different meaning ) . 
  but it 's the standard and sometimes worse standard wins . 
  actually , people in poland kind of look down upon trade schoolers , too . 
  but doing so is also frowned upon :p . technikum attenders have it better but it 's no parent dream to have their child graduate from just that . 
  people attend those sometimes because they ca n't see themselves in the higher education ( feel that they 're `` too stupid '' or something ; not that finishing a bullshit degree requires intelligence , mind you ) , or they ca n't afford it . 
  going to a city ( warsaw especially ) and living there can get very expensive , even if you do n't pay a single zloty for tuition . 
  i have no idea how funding is distributed to schools in poland , but i doubt it is based on test scores . 
  the big idea that the schools are there to `` make everyone 's opportunities equal '' but it 's no secret that kids from rural areas have it worse . 
  mainly because of lack of choice . 
  in poland high school kids like to think of themselves as adults . 
  making `` childish pranks '' like that is more likely in secondary school , called `` gimnazjum '' . 
  and boy , that thing is tough , imagine several hundred 13 -16 yo kids doing their best to be cruel to each other . 
  but after that in high school ( `` liceum '' ) people are mostly relaxed and do n't want to cause trouble either for themselves or others . 
  it generates a bit of a gap when watching american high school movies : `` this girl has already developed tits , why is she acting like she 's 13 yo little bitch ? 
  '' , `` this guy has facial hair and he 's into bullying people because they do n't play sports ? 
  wtf '' . 
  the closest we have to american high school are `` technikum '' and trade schools . 
  it 's the same educational level , but some choose it over liceum as liceum does n't really teach you any marketable skills , it 's supposed to prepare you for university . 
  people who attend these schools are people who are n't probably going to get higher education , so most of the bad apples land there . 
  it 's still not as childish as something you see in american high school movies or something from op 's link . 
  well it should have . 
  i guess it whooshed over my head . 
  have an upvote , then . 
  umm , are you serious ? 
  what does that change ? 
  it was estabilished years ago , and only months after medvedev 's first nomination that this guy is only a `` benevolent face '' of the regime , serving to make a good pr for the russian government ( that is , putin ) . 
  he 's engaging in heartwarming political happenings and talks a lot about `` westernization '' and `` democratic standards '' while in fact he does n't ever bat an eye when they rig election or persecute opposition . 
  i am losing faith in humanity seeing that people actually fall for this bluff . 
  there 's no real border ... yet ? 
  if there 's no room but wall to the right , that means you 're the rightmost . 
  i 'd say that 's deep conservative . 
  it 's aimed at belarussian public . 
  the assumption is : people , who want independent belarus are belarussian and a significant majority of them speaks ( or understands ) belarussian . 
  also , belarussian indepentent tv should air programs in belarussian as opposed to regime russian tv . 
  the hidden assumption is ( i think ) , that they think that russian speaking belarussians are more keen on joining russian federation than the eu , so there 's little point in targeting them . 
  lol , how is this not ? 
  then what is ? 
  monarchism ? 
  i agree loudly !, 
  well if poland qualified for no-visa travel of it 's own , what would be the point of bargaining for this ? 
  we 're usa 's ally , we support them politically and militarily . 
  we want concessions and special treatment . 
  if we 're not getting them , what 's the point of being so dedicated ally ? 
  let 's go the french route , then . 
  moan , protest and oppose american foreign policy . 
  other important factor : 1 ) other countries on visa waiver program have higher denial rate than poland , 2 ) american-poles are a significant minority , especially illnois . 
  3 ) i 'm a fucking european , why should i pay for a visa to visit the colonies ? 
  well sure , we can always fight about stuff , but one thing i learned about germans is that they will remain germans and will get even more german if you keep them out of germany . 
  i have n't really cared about hitler nor did i care to keep germans out of germany in my life . 
  and as for the controversial anschlusses ... they 're not even remotely troublesome nor worth the trouble . 
  if people think germans will push more and more opressive demands ... let them . 
  nobody would accept any more demands . 
  i did n't see any other demands except for this one so far . 
  for what i know , they just do n't want germans to live in austria , france , czechoslovakia and poland . 
  is that such a huge thing to ask for ? 
  only a non-stylish person could have wrote that :p, 
  wood ?
