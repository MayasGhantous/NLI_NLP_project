  if federal europe was implemented with this model in mind , i think it would be fine . 
  of course there are things that need resolution first -- fiscal and budgetary issues . 
   the so-called european identity is but carefully crafted propaganda . 
  so is every other national identity . 
  i am all for a highly decentralised superstate , much like usa . 
  sure , let regional leaders decide how to run greece , portugal , poland or whatever . 
  but i do n't want those bloodthirsty chinese telling world what to do . 
  usa is unable to dominate them alone , but ue+usa would be able to withstand chinese influence and , who knows , save things like human right for the world . 
  screw chinese `` harmony '' , screw their collectivism . 
  i want my rights and my individualism protected by western powers .

  hey , are you a real belarussian , living in belarus right now ? 
  if so , could you make an ama here , perhaps ? 
  i 'm interested how is life in belarus , if it has changed since the economic problems of last years ( we had a rise in by immigrants in poland , as well as increased black market trade ) ? 
  how is lukashenka hanging ? 
  any chances of him going down in the near future ? 
  i am now hungry for kabanos . 
  i hope you 're proud of yourself . 
  as a german native speaker , you 've go a lot to teach me about [ prefixes ] ( http://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpl.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fhottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterkofferattent%c3%a4ter&amp;act=url ) :d edit : translated version , 
  if it means something along the lines of `` likeable '' , then polish `` sympatyczny '' is probably a related . 
  polish : `` kombinowa\u0107 '' it means almost everything from in between of `` improvise '' , `` get done '' , `` manage '' , `` scheme '' , `` permute '' , `` invent '' and `` contrive '' . 
  your friend is acting strangely ? 
  he 's kombinuje something . 
  you need a gram of grass ? 
  lem me skombinuje it for you . 
  plumbing in my flat is faulty ? 
  imma wykombinuje some solution right away . 
  someone is trying to scam you , better watch him before he zakombinuje . 
  your kid is making trouble -- watch him before he wykombinuje something . 
  there is no limit to what could be wykombinowane . 
  i got a feeling that all of this is somehow temporary solution made on the spot . 
  which resonate perfectly with polish culture of not having anything prepared in advance . 
  a lot of things are just done live , kind of [ hail mary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pospolite_ruszenie ) - style . 
  yeah . 
  in america , according to payscale , software engineer gets 40k - 100k $ annually . 
  in germany it is 23k - 80k $ . 
  while cost of living kind of scales , prices of electronics , commodities , drugs and fun often does not . 
  you could simply afford more in the usa . 
  i do n't know if it 's op 's reason , but that 's how it is . 
  wages ? 
  you 're right . 
  dnipropetrovsk is one of the hosts cities of euro 2012 . 
  edit : no . 
  it 's not . 
  actually , all of the choir in julias ' `` echo '' are in polish . 
  i believe there is a fair tranlsation in the comments of this youtube video , if you 're interested . 
  it it , imo , kind of finely forged poetry and wordplay in the polish language . 
  it is pleasuring to listen to this song just to experience polish language ability to express . 
  and this song is mainly in english . 
  so yeah , i 'm gon na recommend some stuff in polish that is imo good , not not massively popular ( not unknown , though ) : - \u017bywio\u0142ak - [ dybuk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axxnwbzitvq ) - greatly powerful west slavic music . 
  if you even remotely enjoyed the witcher or the sequel , you 'll instantly recognize these tones . 
  note , that the lyics are in old polish . 
  - a bit of polish punk rock : defekt muzg\u00f3 - [ ambiwalencje ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-zxuxag48 ) the things that ka_mil posted are also interesting ( especially [ brodka ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ycoabmpiye ) ) , and more mainstream . 
  also , some english-laguage-polish-music electronica bonus ( i really recommend these two ) : - lody - [ play with me ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=572yup7kuug#t=15s ) - skinny patrini - [ delicious ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aor358jaik ), 
  polish alternative-pop : julia marcell - [ echo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_qjuqyihhc ) as a psytrance , deepdubstep and electronica person i ... completely approve of this lady . 
  also , she crowdfunded her first cd . 
  people just gave her money because they wanted to hear more of her . 
  edit : ah , what the hell -- if someone likes it , here 's another great one from julia : [ crows ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rr1ni-y-lc&amp;feature=related ), 
  yes , i oversimplified when i assumed that everybody under the `` new '' minimal wage would be sacked . 
  of course that would n't be everyone . 
  for those who 'd stay -- more power to them , the minimum wage intention has fulfilled it 's role . 
  they were underpaid and now they 're less underpaid . 
  note that this does n't change tax revenue much . 
  as for the rest , my post still applies . 
  so whatever the percentage may be ( between 1 % sacked and 100 % sacked ) there is still loss included , just scaled down , because the increased profit will be consumed by welfare services anyway . 
  and the benefit , well , the only one i can think of is helping underpaid workers to renegotiate their contract . 
  and i do n't think it 's state 's job to do this . 
  actually , i think we agree that a way for `` minimum wage slaves '' to improve their income is to reeducate themselves . 
  whether they are sacked because of implementing high minimum wage or not , to be profitable to pay them more they need to improve their marketable skills . 
  why implement the minimum wage then ? 
  they need to reeducate either way . 
  wow , you are angry . 
  how old are you ? 
  where are you from ? 
  i did not enslave shit , my friend . 
  the only thing i put to work is my hands . 
  and in fact , i do not demand to pay anyone minimum wage , i am leaning to the opinion that minimum wage should be abolished or kept really low . 
  so i do n't really know what you are talking about . 
  direct [ response ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/se2r6/brussels_to_push_for_euwide_minimum_wage/c4db2up ), 
  yeah , communalize all the things !, 
  ... wait , what ? 
  i 'm sorry , is this sarcasm i did n't get ? 
  if no , have you ever tried to function in collectivized economy ? 
  or have you seen the effects of such ? 
  what slavery ? 
  and what do you think would happen to people who earn minimum wage , if it was drastically raised ? 
  the naive approach is to believe that * they would earn more * . 
  that is not what would happen . 
  they 're going to be ** laid off ** . 
  yes , i misinterpreted the title and did n't read the article , sorry  . 
  i thought that it is really about implementing a fixed amount of xxxx euros minimum wage in every country , regardless of pay scales . 
  poland already has implemented a minimum wage of about 350 euros . 
  i was talking about what would happen if this rose , say , four times . 
  i see that it could work in the us this way , with their approach to social security . 
  it is ( the social security ) very limited there unlike european states , poland included . 
  i guess , in europe a state would have to compensate/aid laid off workers , for a time at least . 
  the more workers are laid off , the more aid the state would have to issue . 
  that would , in turn , translate into more taxation , because these money have to come from somewhere , so we would probably see some new , creative taxes . 
  these taxes are the reason why we would n't experience so much of a gdp growth .
