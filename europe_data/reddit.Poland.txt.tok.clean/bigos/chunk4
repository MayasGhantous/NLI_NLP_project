  but seriously , around upper silesia and opole region there is strong sentiment for germany . 
  in some muncipalities there are even [ bilingual street signs ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/%c5%81ubowice_tablica.jpg/200px-%c5%81ubowice_tablica.jpg ) and german is second language . 
  most people from these parts would tell you that germany is their favorite , 
  um , are you aware where did soviet architects get their inspiration ? 
  this building / u/jamska had posted was opened in 1930 , way before moscow state university was built . 
  exactly what i was asking for . 
  thank you !, 
  whats the story , for us , non-romanians ? 
  i 'm a different judge and i say they should fight with knives . 
   dumplings filled with hash niceee bro 420 blaze it, 
  just to let you know : you have allies . 
  we exist , even among the poles . 
  people who hate pierogi ruskie . 
  it 's like the whole world has gone mad and feasts on dough cakes filled with potatoes o_o . 
  this this tier0 shit food , and we know it , but somehow , in some kind of strange , weird way , pierogi ruskie are the favorite kind to many . 
  incomprehensible . 
  we need to stick together , man . 
  there , there, 
  yet , directly two paragraphs before your quote is a confirmation of what i said :  the s\u0142oneczko ( lit . 
  `` little sun '' ) is an early slavic pagan symbol of the sun . 
  it was engraved on wooden monuments built near the final resting places of fallen slavs to represent eternal life it is old slavic symbol , too . 
  council = = rada in all instances , imo . 
  ... it 's related to old-slavic customs . 
  old-slavs used such a symbol , too . 
  what is exactly your problem ? 
  poland : to store property rights we use the old system of `` ksi\u0119gi wieczyste '' ( `` land register '' ) . 
  it 's maintained by special kind of court in judical brannch of government . 
  any change of ownership needs to be registered there or is invalid . 
  there is a register for every property ( every flat and building ) , they contain whole history of that property , as well as mortgages and everyone is allowed to request any register . 
  the hook is -- you need to know the special number to know which one to request . 
  couple of years ago it was all digitzed with a great effort ( very big amount of old documents needed to be scanned or retyped to the system ) . 
  if you know the register id you can look at it [ here ] ( https://ekw.ms.gov.pl/eukw/menu.do ) . 
  the city i live in made a special service available that lets you search for a register id using the address , so i was able to do a background check in the papers of a flat i was planning to buy . 
  both georgia and ukraine themselves chose to be pro-western . 
  in georgia that was roses revolution in the early 00s and orange rev/maidan in ukraine . 
  those countries are well within their rights to associate with anyone they desire . 
  russia is acting imperialistic when it tries to steer those countries policies , and frankly , they should n't even be allowed a warning for doing that . 
  yet , they got one , undeserved free shot , but i really think it is now high time to `` push back '' , or we 'll be pushed over . 
  well , they did hand over advanced missile system to incompetent fucks . 
  so yeah , that would not has happened if it was n't for russia . 
  i blame them 100 % . 
  he is already in the second stage of your `` if '' sentence . 
  he already invaded georgia , ukraine is the second case . 
  one thing i love reddit for is * the appropriation * . 
  the crazy conspiracy theories are in / r/conspiracy . 
  that 's just lovely . 
   there 's always more to do than money . 
  right now there is dire need of exactly money . 
   that 's not what those bureaucrats do . 
  that 's a job for a commission of doctors . 
  zus contracts more people than just clerks that you , or your it friends meet with . 
  the comissioners and doctors are on their payroll , too . 
  but i 'm not going to defend mismanagement in zus , because there are other public services , paid directly from taxes , that are in need of cash pump . 
  ones that you just shunned by saying : `` this is true everywhere '' . 
  yes , and it 's true here , too . 
  so why do n't we grab a little of those corporate profits and throw them at that . 
   i do n't see anything wrong in the existence of state-owned hospitals , they can be profitable too . 
  great , i think state-owned hospitals are good idea , too . 
  i just do n't think their goal is to `` be profitable '' . 
  hospitals , like schools , roads , kindergardens , police and firefighters are a cost , but a necessary cost . 
  they do not exist to bring profit . 
   which did n't last long and yet , since then we see the state are a guardian of all the citizens , especially the disenfranchised , like the poor who are ( * especially * in capitalism ) exploited by the rich . 
  it is directly in the ideal role of the state to protext them from exploitation . 
   my entire income is from online yeah , i thought so . 
  it 's easy to imagine that every company takes their things and goes away , but we 're ( online companies and services ) a pretty small slice of the whole economy . 
  not everything could be offshored , and frankly -- mostly the exploitative , slave jobs . 
  exercise : whay would happen , if software companies taxes went up twice in poland ? 
  answer : nothing , because they 'd still be twice as much cheaper than their western counterparts . 
   double taxation agreements have nothing to do with tax residency . 
  then how would you operate in poland without tax residency ? 
  because in world , that would be impossible . 
  want to operate in my country ? 
  pay my country 's taxes . 
  i do n't see how removing double taxation agreement would make tax evasion easier . 
  if anything , that would make tax office work easier . 
  the company has profit -----  pay up , bitch . 
  there 's probably a copy somewhere on the internet , but it only take to bring a video down on the biggest media outlets to make it hard to google for . 
  and on the same time he does n't publish the video ? 
  why do you think ? 
  he said he has it . 
  my shot is he 's buying time . 
  maybe all of it will go away when it 's time to pay a fine ? 
   what public services ? 
  most public services are dramatically overfinanced and overstaffed i take you never been to a hospital ? 
  yeah , those services . 
  also , policemen who run out of gas budget , schools that are closed because there are n't funds to teach children in the rural regions , road services that need to prioritize which potholes will they patch , because they have only so much budget . 
  there is massive underfinancing in the public sector . 
  as for zus , it is certainly not a job for only a computer program . 
  i take you 're unfamiliar with what does zus do ? 
  go talk with a disabled person , ask them about the ux of the program they 'd like to allow their rent . 
   nfz is basic healthcare for poor people no , it 's universal healthcare . 
  moreover , it 's the ** only ** place you 're going to get treatment because private companies wo n't deal with things more expensive than a corporate employee flu . 
  for well organized universal healthcare , see the british nhs . 
  ** completely ** socialized . 
   the state is there to protect the haves from have-nots , to uphold private property rights . 
  it was always like that . 
  three words : the french revolution . 
  it 's when this hypothesis of your was turned upside-down . 
  that 's why we call it a revolution . 
  that 's also why it 's so liked by the leftists .
