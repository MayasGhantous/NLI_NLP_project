  i 'm still sure that there 's a longer video on youtube with exactly this sequence as a part of it . 
  sorry if the questions are to invasive , feel free to not answer , but i have to ask because i rarely find an active belarussian redditor : how did recent events in ukraine affect belarussian opinion of russia ? 
  how are the opinions in your circle of friends ? 
  how do belarussians see poland ? 
  would you like to have closer links with poland ? 
  i know belarussian people see themselves as the successor state of grand duchy of lithuania , you celebrate grunwald victory , etc. 
  how do people see that part of history ? 
  thanks in advance for taking the time to answer one curious guy , 
  one of the saddest thing i 've seen for some time . 
  also , simon does n't seem to believe that the ukrainian state would provide care for the people . 
  i mean , sure , they dispatched most rudimentary help , water and bread - that much we 've seen in the video but what happens to people like that poor grandma ? 
  is ukraine willing to/capable of patching up their walls ? 
  more like there 's only one person who can read cyrilic and he 's always late . 
  well , russia is humongous and has a lot resources , so there 's more cash hanging around . 
  lithuania is much smaller so it 's harder to find a fat tit to suck from , but overall people in lt have better lives than in russia . 
  not only monetarily , they also do n't need to fear a policeman . 
  other europeans ( `` germans '' ) upping their economical indicators ( `` more arbeit '' ) means euro price goes up . 
  if our productivity ca n't follow we lose competition . 
  if we had pln still , we could devalue it and 1 ) throw some more money on things because of print , and 2 ) keep our prices competitive, 
  i 'm all for it , but we need to be protected from undue currency price rise . 
  in other words , i do n't want our products to get more expensive because the germans feel like more arbeit this month . 
  expensive beef, 
  dittto for half-ruthenien podlasie, 
  i do n't know where this data came from , but in the census there were questions about whether your home has a indoor bathroom . 
  you think people declare they do n't have it , because they do not have a permit ? 
  - so , you a funny guy , eh ? 
  yeah , we get good press now , for a change . 
  then it also makes you think about what you read or hear about other countries . 
  they have their problems , too , like we have ours . 
  it does n't take to be world power/paradise on earth to have a great reputation . 
  thanks for making me laugh  . 
  you actually went through his post history and commented on question he asked ? 
  that 3 point , but the fact you think linux distros are sorted by `` skill level '' is 7 point at least . 
  i guess high turnout would be their killer . 
  and once they 're gone , they 're gone for good . 
  the question is : when will we get election with high turnout ? 
  that 's pretty ingegnious :d also in poland we have our own version of yours `` zazhopye '' - `` zadupie '' . 
  means practically the same . 
  but then it would n't go viral !, 
  it 's just a job damn well done as a marketing campaign . 
  and i think it promotes newly governmental web service for checking buses . 
  now everyone has the chance to learn about it  . 
  the psl might had pivoted . 
  but they did n't , so ... yeah . 
  i would argue that main descendants of kievan rus culture are the russians themselves . 
  it 's the continuity of ruling class and lanfguage that binds them together . 
  muscovite princedom was part of the kievan rus world . 
  and then i understand ukrainian culture as a mixture of said proto-russian culture with polish and tartar elements , and it only started to emerge in - what , xv century ? 
  in short , i would say kievan rus has developed both in russian and ukrainian cultures altough ukrainian branched off relatively recently . 
  umm ... 
  i 'm pretty sure that what is today called `` ukrainian culture '' developed much , much after russian culture estabilished . 
  there was russian culture flourishing when there was n't even a word `` ukraine '' and those lands were desolate launching pads for tartar raids . 
  `` john armor the second protected little children '' it 's a play on a joke that polish trolls use . 
  they often say jp2gmd which translates to `` john paul the second raped little children '' to offend catholics . 
  yeah , the jp2 statue craze went totally out of control . 
  [ some ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=najgorsze+pomniki+jana+paw%c5%82a+ii&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=pi-bu6l8hosp7abtu4b4&amp;ved=0cdeqsaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979 ) of those ... 
  i do n't even know if they 're funny or terrifying . 
  most of the regulars do . 
  you can set one for yourself in sidebar . 
  i can buy it , though , i just hate the flavour . 
  of hard liquor i only drink whisky or tequilla . 
  the description matches . 
  yeah , too many ruskies and germans at kr\u00f3lewiec , time to return to poland , 
   but today in our regions it 's mostly people 's laziness and fear of taking risks that holds them back o rly ? 
  that 's utter bullshit and you know it . 
  not even the craziest neolib would say it 's feasible for everyone to `` take risk '' and be `` free to decide their fate '' , unless they choose to die from hunger . 
  the whole point of capitalist system is that capital is controlled by the few . 
  we 're not participating in it 's distribution , nor we do have a say about what gets done . 
  we ' are only paid off to not interfere . 
  not to mention current and incoming structural job shortage . 
  our current system was designed in times of shortage of labor . 
  we 're in fundamentally different place now . 
  i do n't fear my government . 
  i can go on a manifestation . 
  ca n't say i 'm sure percentages reported by polish stat agiencies are 100 % accurate , but i trust them . 
  i 've got friends in russia . 
  this is the country where when you see a policeman , you better get out of their way , because they just might be in the mood for a little extortion . 
  that 's an awkward position . 
  as far as i understand , this is the effect of polish electoral action in the vilnius region . 
  now , polish government official stance is that this is an foreign party and it does not deal with foreign opposition parties . 
  on the other hand , in poland a popular opposition party is vocally supporting polish minority in lithuania which probably strike ethnic lithuanians as hostile . 
  really , it 's something that official governments on both sides try their best to ignore , but the opposition parties stir this shit up to gain support . 
  look and learn , that 's what happens if you play the `` nation '' card in politics . 
  yeah , but there are massive flaws at every level of this rating . 
  the media spew blatant propaganda , the agencies report what they 're told , the people are not allowed to manifest their views on the street . 
  these are percents on steroids . 
  also , i 'm always appaled to see to what extent russian people are afraid of their government . 
  they really fear the power . 
  this was gerard depardieu speaking, 
  oh boy , oh boy [ enjoy !,

  yes , i think most europeans agree with `` class struggle '' idea , even if subconsciously . 
  every man i 've spoken with has this concept of `` the rich '' and `` the poor '' ( altough everyone seems to position themselves in between , regardless of income , which is funny ) . 
  they get the idea of class struggle at the gut level : the rich are too rich and exploit me ( like , my boss ) , and the poor are trying to live at my cost ( immigrants/those lazy bums ) . 
  seeing the world like that is marxist to me and even right-wing parties often go that way . 
  that being said , yeah , i kind of skimmed over the `` leninist '' part , but then again - i doubt the op even meant that . 
  where do you find a `` leninist '' these days ? 
  nobody 's thinks like that . 
  now , marxist is sexy again on the left side . 
  i also do n't trust my fellow redditors to differentiate between various streams of leftist ideology .
