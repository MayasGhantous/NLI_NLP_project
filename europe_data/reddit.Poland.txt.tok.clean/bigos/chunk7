  yeah , if ideology does n't get in the way , we 'll probably hold the euro adoption for as long as possible . 
  every year without turbo-expensive euro is a year we get to chase the affulent western europe . 
  on the other hand , if pln starts to gain value significantly , then maybe it 's time to reconsider . 
  yeah , you have succesfully waited it out . 
  even if you take down the visa requirement , i would n't expect any massive influx of polish immigrants . 
  the steam had been released into the uk :d . 
  best country ad campaign of the last decade . 
  only brazilian boobs campaign compares . 
  did you read anything from marx ? 
  you 're presenting the view that is most often spoonfed to neoliberals/neocons , but hold very little merit . 
  first , many europeans accepts marx 's views on society , class struggle and most importantly the capital . 
  i 'd say most of them . 
  hell , even in our language , a word `` kapita\u0142 '' is a concept directly from marx ( look it up !, 
  and it doesn not means just `` finance '' ! ) . 
  second , marx had a lot of insightful remarks but very little reform proposal . 
  i do not know what do you mean by `` implement radical marxist reforms '' and i think you do n't know either . 
  if you think words `` marxist reform '' are self-explainatory , you 're wrong . 
  third , having reform ideas after reading marx 's literature is not a all uncommon and noe every one of them is `` completely surreal '' . 
  a lot of them make perfect sense , like pensions or progressive tax rates . 
  lol, 
  yeah , speak for yourself . 
  i find that a lot people talking about poland lately think they know what they 're talking about , but they do n't . 
  what do you think `` levelheaded '' constitutes ? 
  i 'm getting an impression that you think it 's like it was 25 years ago : poland is a piss-poor state on the brink of collapse and can only try to evade their grim fate by careful diplomatic maneuvering . 
  well it 's not the case . 
  poland may not be as powerful state as gb or fr , but it 's weight heightens and with all of it 's treaties and capabilities is able to stand for it 's interests . 
  i 'm sorry if that offends you . 
  haha , nobody considers themselves eastern european :d that 's like a geopolitical joke , nobody 's going to admit it . 
  poles , czechs , hungarians and even ukrainians will tell you they 're central european . 
  the baltics will claim north europe . 
  romania & bulgaria would preferably go with southern or balkan or central , too . 
  russians and belarussians do n't give a fuck wat you think so on point on sticking the eastern label to them  . 
  seriously , the eastern europe is a tainted brand . 
  ah , but have you invested ? 
  this is like wars in subsaharan africa are started !, 
  i hope voting like that is n't widespread in europe , otherwise we should n't proceed with pan-european election yet : /, 
  nice try , hitler2 . 
  i 'm from wroc\u0142aw , poland . 
  we get a lot of old germans . 
  this place was a major city in pre-war germany and a lot of old people in germany want to visit the place they were born and lived in . 
  the germans are , well , germans . 
  they move as an organized unit with a guide and really do n't do much else . 
  there are also a lot erasmus students . 
  they tend to keep to themselves . 
  every season they infest a different set of pubs , so we locals need to know where the plague is currently located . 
  when they haunt a place it changes into crowded hub of clueless , but recently unleashed teens to early twenties . 
  loud , do n't know their limits , harmless but obnoxious . 
  guys from islamic countries and southern europe tend to think all of polish girls want their dick so their presence is especially inconvienient for the ladies . 
  a bit of koreans , too , for some reason ? 
  maybe because large korean corpos have their factories near the city , so they 're probably friends and families of korean staff . 
  they 're very isolated . 
  they have their own restaurants that only advertise in korean . 
  sorry , but yes you are and the result is meaningless if you forget the path . 
  for example , if poland was not promised substantial funds from the eu it might have not joined at all . 
  then both france and poland would hurt , as french products would have a hard time competing with priviledged polish companies on the vast polish market . 
  the eu funds for poland are one side of the transaction that on the other side gave french companies unlimited access to 40 million consumers . 
  you really do n't get to be entitled to the way poles spend their budget . 
  you do n't like providing convergence funds and seeing beneficiaries still independent ? 
  remember they could easily embargo the shit out of your company products . 
  but none of us wants that . 
  there are no `` free money '' on the table so do n't feel responsible for how they 're being spent . 
  warships for russia ? 
  not that i strongly disagree with you , but i have my doubts . 
  how do you value security ? 
  this deal is so suspicious it 's hard to believe that it 's for `` agricultural infrastructure '' , unless you farm your fields with tear gas and apc 's . 
  what if we 're pumping this money to get rid of transnistria rogue state ? 
  to get rid of hostile government 's exclave near our borders ? 
  also , that is not that much of cash . 
  as i counted in an earlier post , it 's '' ~ 0,15 % of polish yearly budget '' . 
  one tenth of a one percent . 
  you 're skipping a lot of middle men here . 
  here what 's happening : 1 . 
  all eu ** countries ** pay cash to eu budget - some pay more , some pay less , that depends on their `` richness '' . 
  this is agreed upon . 
  some eu ** citizens ** get some of the cash back . 
  citizens in some countries are given more opportunities than others and this is also agreed upon . 
  notice , that no government received money to distribute it as it wants -- the money comes as part of eu programs and has to be spent accordingly . 
  besides , polish budget for 2014 is 70 billion $ . 
  82 bln $ is cash set for poland from 2014-2020 eu budget ( let 's say it 's 13,5 bln yearly , for the sake of calculation ) . 
  so , the sum loaned away is : ** ~ 0,15 % ** of polish yearly budget and ** ~ 0,7 % ** of eu funds yearly value . 
  not that big of a deal . 
  so while currently money ( at least a chunk of it ) actually flows from france to poland , it is not spent ** by ** poland , more like ** on ** poland . 
  also notice that this is only a current situation -- poland is not some kind of `` eternal beneficiary '' and poland pays it 's share , too . 
  it was just negotiated that more money gets spent on poland that poland pay . 
  now , the second thing : the loan poland 's providing . 
  this money does n't come from the same place as the eu funds . 
  these are funds from polish budget , set aside for things like that . 
  yes , if the eu funds were n't flowing in , poland would probably have to settle for smaller amount , but it 's still polish sovereign decision to loan this money . 
  ** tl ; dr ; ** poland pays too , negotiated the cash back , also it 's not that much cash , also it 's from a different pile of cash . 
  ... or better yet , install some backdoors :d, 
  yes , it is a in everyones ' interest to stop the guy with a real nuke , and yes , actually firing a nuclear weapon would have massive opposition everywhere . 
  but still do n't see it as `` obvious '' that using a nuke is a suicide . 
  despite it being in the best interest of other nuclear powers , they might not want to take action . 
  to me , destruction of a nuclear-state in berserk mode is not certain . 
  are there any , i do n't know , official doctrines about it ? 
  saying things like : whenever we detect a nuke being fired , we immediately bomb this place out of existence , or something like that ? 
  i often hear that argument , but i really do n't understand why . 
  let 's say , ukraine has nukes . 
  russia invades crimea and eastern parts of the country , ukraine fires it 's missiles . 
  obviously russia counterattacks .
