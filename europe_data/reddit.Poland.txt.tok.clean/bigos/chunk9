  i do n't think it started that late . 
  polish women had it good long before . 
  for example , womens right to inheritance were never questioned . 
  women in poland were always allowed to own businesses , farms etc , etc. 
  in the west they had this rigid patriarchate of the old times , while slavic women were more respected and had more rights in general . 
  it went bad for polish women in 18th , 19th and early 20th century , when the women were kind of dominated by men -- but still they got their voting rights instantly after independence was attained . 
  nowadays , western countries went ahead faster with women 's rights , while we struggle with our traditionalist folk , but it was n't always like that . 
  for most of our history , it was actually better to be a woman in poland than in the west . 
  we even had [ woman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jadwiga_of_poland ) crowned as a king ( not `` a queen '' - to emphasize her right to rule she was named a king ) . 
  still , there are things that polish women never had to fight for , unlike their western sisters . 
  especially primator double , known among my friends as the dominator . 
  try if you could drink two and return home . 
  100 % correct , i , too , am a lager guy . 
  proably explains why i hold that opinion  . 
  spot on , i do really drink lagers and weissbier almost exclusively . 
  that probably explains why i hold my opinion . 
  however i started to develop a taste for those darker kinds , so maybe my opinion will change . 
  hopefully i step by some good quality english ale . 
   not on the level of belgium or england disputable !, 
  i 'm going to give you a pass regarding belgium ( i 'd say belgian are equal or better to czech ) , but english beer is really overrated !, 
  i 'd say not only czechs beat the english at it , but also germans , poles and ukrainians . 
  splendid idea !, 
  oh , did they unban it since the last time ? 
  i 'm losing count how many times they embargoed our products out of political reasons . 
  i should probably buy a domain ispolishfoodbannedinrussia.com that 's list what products are currenntly under embargo . 
  still , i do n't think there 's any of conflict between slavs and latins . 
  we 're in rivalry with germanics !, 
  how about a brand new , warsaw-produced [ ursus ] ( http://traktory.net.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/traktor-ursus.jpg ) ? 
  [ why ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/light_hair_coloration_map.png ) [ not ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/light_eyes_map.png ) ? 
  first map is light hair map , second is light eyes map . 
  slavs are generally `` whiter '' than south europeans . 
  they 're only second `` whiter '' after scandinavians . 
  yes , i think so . 
  a lot of them were forcefully assimilated in the 60 's or so they might be hardly distinguishable from regular poles . 
  but yeah , the more i think about it , the more i 'm sure we have our own , too . 
  my mother , who grew up in the village in the eastern part of the country told me that several times a year , a gypsy convoy would arrive and sell pans and other ironworks . 
  but they were `` pacified ' very early in her life , they were n't coming anymore by 1970s . 
  for what it 's worth , poland has also pretty crappy reputation , but : a ) it does not hinder us that much -- when the deals are profitable , nobody 's going to give a shit about national stereotypes b ) it does n't last - polish bad rap is waning , as more people visit , as we improve safety ^ ( export criminals , really ^ but ^ shhh ) , as our policies in the eu are succeeding - less and less people see poland as a crminal , poverty stricken wasteland , and more like a developing country with bright future and right priorities . 
  and the real change was n't as big as the reputation change . 
  romania could very well follow this path as i find them similar . 
  do n't tell me you 've never heard it used like that . 
  not nice at all , but it functions like that , unfortunetely . 
  edit : well , the guys below me say they never heard of it ... maybe that 's just a regional slur . 
  it was certainly in use when i was in middle school in upper silesia . 
  now that you mention it , it is in our history books , at least . 
  they also teach us that a lot of our government and army men fled fallen poland through romania to france in 1939 . 
  also you provided some munitions at the start of the war , i think ? 
  well , in pl that 's connected to influx of romanian gypsies back during the communist era and 90s . 
  they are seen leading their traditional lifestyle , on the margin of society . 
  begging , stealing , and conning people . 
  if there 's a fortune teller in poland , it 's probably gypsy woman . 
  other than that , gypsies were often selling various kinds of plastic crap on flea markets . 
  most of the gypsies have romanian citizenship , so they 're lumped together as `` romanians '' , while general pole knows ** absolutely nothing ** about romania or it 's people . 
  well i guess we know where it lies and what 's the capital , but nothing past that . 
  i bet not many people would even know that the dracula meme comes from romania ( `` transylvania ? 
  sure , a fictional region here the vampires live '' ) . 
  i guess poles could use some kind of marketing campaign that would differentiate romanians from romanian gypsies in polish minds . 
  i think romania has a lot of things to offer that poles would like : wines , weather , they get along with slavs , they experienced ussr occupation , too , they 're educated and seem affordable even for our wallets . 
  well okay , next time we 're having a conversation about those people you can use the term `` terrorist '' to describe them , but how the fuck is that an answer to parent post is beyond me . 
  contain your `` whataboutism '' , comrade . 
  i 'm not saying they 're not biased , just that they are not owned or ran by murdoch . 
  murdoch 's son was placed in a ** board ** of directors . 
  the board votes , and his vote weights as much as his share ratio . 
  it 's still only 5 % power . 
  this thread has hundreds of posts . 
  do you expect me to read all that ? 
  i browsed through first 5 or so highest voted answers and nobody there taken apart anything . 
  nor did you write/paste anything of substance about . 
  i guess now is the time you provide some proof that entire `` vice was bought by newscorp '' ? 
  just as i thought . 
  vice was n't `` bought '' by newscorp at all . 
  murdoch bought 5 % of vice shares . 
  in other words , vice is owned by murdoch in 5 % and has exactly that much of a vote in the company . 
  if you think his 5 % outvotes everyone else 's , count this shit again and again until you draw the right conclusion .

  also , i 'd pick different spots . 
  these are mostly `` bland nature '' shots and the cities ... well , sorry , but they are n't that pretty . 
  sure it looks cool in hdr , but i think there are nicer places . 
  so you have no reliable source to back it up ? 
  great !, 
  bullshit time it is !, 
  well me and my friend heard from the god of efficient spending that the polish army is going to be next years miss spendy . 
  which is like miss universe but of the world of efficient spending . 
  also , my friend agrees , so yeah . 
   watch out !!!!, 
  the russian bear is right behind you !!!, 
  jk yeah , actually it is , and it just helped itself to ukrainian picnic basket . 
  how about there 's some unpleasant tanks standing between thebear and my basket ? 
  i 'd prefer for bear to be put down , but ca n't really wrestle it alone . 
  and it 's not going to be shot in the head when we 're picnicing with the likes of you . 
  well , you look it up . 
  while your argument has some merit , it is ** not ** a `` broken window fallacy '' . 
  the `` broken window fallacy '' is when you claim that a war/destruction/damage is good , because it calls for repair , and that repair is fueling the economy . 
  hence the name : you break the window , the glassmaker gets paid . 
  paying military contractors does not increase demand for hospitals or schools . 
  it may be squandering resources or you might argue that military development increases demand for military goods so it works kind of like that , but not it 's not plain , old straight broken window fallacy . 
  source ? 
  there are no swastikas in hearts of iron ( grand strategy ) series :( but that might actually be because of the developer policy , not because german law . 
  funny as it is , it still requires that driven hipster kid who 'd do it . 
  up until now , despite all that seemingly dangerous situations vice reporters got in ( drinking with kim jong un in bestkorea , anyone ?
