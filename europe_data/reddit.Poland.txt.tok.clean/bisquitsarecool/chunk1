shhh . . do n't tell 'em . 
  let them think they 're geniuses just for a while . 
  30 minutes ( 9,5 km ) bike ride every day . 
  bike lanes look like [ this ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/54/a8/bd/z12429396q,sciezka-rowerowa-wzdluz-al--zwyciestwa-w-gdansku-.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.rowerowygdansk.pl/download/2013_12/380.jpg ) . 
   polish are like germans who complain less and actually have a sense of humour . 
  [ well , no :d ] ( http://www.szysza.pl/upload/images/za_umiarkowanie_2014-04-27_19-24-10_middle.jpg ) writing says : ` too hot | too wet | too cold | -- | too moderate ! ', 
  never ask a pole `` how are you ? 
  how it 's going ? '', 
  if you do n't want to hear long list of complaints . 
  same in poland . 
  never heard of ` immigrant ' , always ` refugees ' . 
  shots of mothers and crying children all day long but 85 % of immigrants are men . 
  hungary = heartless bastard , immigrants = poor people running away from war . 
  no one asks such questions as : why are they running away to the most wealthy countries instead of first eu country ? , is there a possibility that some of them are connected with is ? , how many will come here ? 
  unfortunate translation . 
  `` wielkopolska '' literally means rather `` big poland '' than `` better poland '' . 
  have same joke here in poland . 
  one of my favourite jokes about poland though . 
  that 's true , but even tomatoes from garden in northern poland are waaay better than those from market . 
  simply because tomatoes in market are picked before they 're `` ready '' and they `` mellow '' in transport/on shelves . 
  they 'll never be as good as garden tomatoes , no matter which country they 're from . 
  garden tomatoes also have different shapes , sizes and rarely are truly red , they do n't look `` tasty '' . 
  they 're not ready for picking in the same time . 
  when you 're picking by yourself you can choose those which are ready , when you 're picking on a huge farm you ca n't do that . 
  they ca n't be stored for a long time like onion or potatoes . 
  tomato is a pretty problematic vegetable . 
  source : i have tomatoes in my garden . 
  i have tomato blood in my veins , my life is tomato . 
  you forgot freezing wind . 
  we blame both . 
  how about this one ? 
  it looks like a bunker and was painted 2 years ago .

  i personally know a man who threw a table out of a window , because jesus told him to do it . 
  i also met a man who tried to run through the closed door . 
  because jesus told him to do it . 
  another one was waving an axe in public and shouting something about the end of the world , doom etc. 
  this time it was n't jesus , but some non-specified aliens . 
  luckily he did n't hurt anyone before police arrived . 
  sounds like mental illness to me . 
  thinking that all muslims want to behead someone because woman who is a muslim did it is a fallacy ( very retarded fallacy if you want to know my opinion ) . 
  60/60 mb/s for 35 pln ( ~ 8 eur ) . 
  nowadays not at all . 
  10 years ago it was easy to spot a few of them every day , now i have n't seen any in last week . 
  maybe it depends on region ( i live in gdansk and sometimes travel to smaller cities in pomerania ) . 
  in bad old times ( before fall of communism ) it was quite rare to spot any other car than fiat 125 and 126 , cause you simply could n't go to the dealer and buy a car . 
  after '89 imported cars started to be available , but they were damn expensive . 
  if you were , let 's say , a teacher you could n't afford to buy golf mk iii or astra f , but fiat 126p was quite cheap and it 's better to have shitty car than do n't have car at all . 
  imported cars in early '90s were so damn expensive that someone who can now afford pretty nice car like top version of new mazda 6/ford mondeo/skoda superb could buy crashed golf mk ii back then . 
  in '98 my grandfather who ran his own bussiness and was rather ` rich ' could buy new ford escort mk v 1.6 16v without ac and electric windows . 
  that 's why there are so many 126 's on this photo . 
  it was a car that an average family could afford back then . 
  su was doing that kind of things all the time , even when people were literally starving . 
  i really doubt that thousands of su spies in europe just disappeared in '90s or putin told them recently `` sry , guys , no monies , oil 's too cheap '' . 
  we are generally more cynical and less `` relativistic '' - if we fund someone a house and after a year or so it 's devastated , we are generally pissed . 
  we do n't wonder what ` made ' a tenants devastate that house or we do n't sympathize with them that now they have to live in devastated house . 
  that was our money and help for them and they just disdained it . 
  our approach is like : `` i wanted to help you but you did n't want it . 
  fuck you then , sir . '', 
  that 's why you see housing developments like lunik ix in kosice ( slovakia ) . 
  that 's why i wrote : `` it is said '' . 
  call me racist , but here in poland it 's obvious that you do n't give any money to gypsies . 
  never . 
  those are organized gangs from romania ( they often do n't even speak polish ) usually exploiting children . 
  they beg in front of churches , malls , at railway stations , in trams ... and they 're usually very intrusive/agressive . 
  you 'd better watch your wallet when you see a man with accordion and 2-3 little dirty children in train/tram . 
  this happens not as often as 20 years ago , but still is not rare . 
  sometimes they offer you a `` great deal '' on a parking lot - perfume , car radio ( rare nowadays ) , `` swatch '' watch , `` golden '' bracelet , you name it . 
  those are always fake or stolen . 
  never let them to tell you your future ( eg from cards ) - you 'll probably get robbed . 
  it is said that those `` poor children '' are maimed on purpose and under influence of drugs ( opiates ) or alcohol - to make you feel sorry about them . 
  that 's the basics of survival for those who have n't met gypsy beggars yet . 
  remember this or call me racist and get scammed . 
  surprisingly polan can not into vodka too . 
  in eu we are on the 19th position in alcohol consumption per capita . 
  and the leader ( luxembourg ) drinks 50 % more alcohol than us ( wtf luxembourg ? 
  `` good change '' . 
  did he also say that homosex eat da poo-poo ? 
  they also have - statistically - more partners and more ` risky ' behavior ( like sex with newly met person ) . 
  however they 're better educated about stds and test themselves much more often than heterosexuals . 
  ( spot the paradox . ), 
  it 's politically incorrect but it is true that gay men have higher risk of getting hiv ( also hcv and syphilis ) . 
  % of gay men among hiv + population vary throughout the world . 
  in africa men/women ratio is ~ 50/50 ( mainly heterosexual unprotected sex ) . 
  in europe there are more men with hiv than women ( high % of homosexuals ) . 
  in russia there are also many drug addicts who use disposable needles more than once . 
   does anybody know how western countries reduced the spread of it ? 
  condoms are cheap and available . 
  there are centers where you can anonymously test your blood for hiv for free . 
  education . 
  low birth rates ( protected sex - condoms are the most popular method ) . 
  effective anti-retroviral therapy for everyone . 
  needles are cheap and available - now it 's quite rare to use non-disposable needles . 
  nah , we 'll call it `` x '' but make it `` same-sex marriage '' . 
  some day . 
  there 's probably no law you ca n't get around if you really want it . 
   if you live behind that , you need to walk up to 900 metres more . 
  you can also take a bus . 
  \u261e \u1d54 \u2200 \u1d54 \u261e not kidding , there are 3 bus stops in front of that mascaron . 
  every time after piss or poop , coming back home ( you could just touch a handle some bum touched before ... ) , before preparing food and eating , before shaving ...
