why wont you let decide community whats shit and whats not ? 
  sweden , yes !, 
  as you all know gabber people are living in harmony with the bass drum . 
  posting only few artists would n't show the big picture how the scene was big and influential . 
  belgians and dutch liked to experiment and did n't hesitate making beats harder and more aggressive . 
  since late 80s they were spawning new genres every few years . 
  [ new beat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xuipcxjmmw ) , [ eurodance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4m7qtlo8vk ) , [ techno rave ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcnnf7fpo68 ) , [ trance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeew_isyyae ) , [ hard trance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pspzrgnlg14 ) , [ gabber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orxsxx11zhu ) , [ hardstyle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utlareer45u ) , [ hardcore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uslvw0gup4 ) , [ jumpstyle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2ljlluairs ) were all products ( total or partially ) of this environment . 
  rave music scene from belgium and netherlands . 
  `` this is poland , not brussels , islam is not supported here . '', 
  `` down with union occupation ! '', 
  yup , better stay silent under brussels whip . 
  the biggest reason behind polish demography problem is too low income in relation to high taxes and cost of living . 
  every time there is a news report on tv about absurdly failed heist , the robbery crew is always reffered as gang olsena . 
  at the time poland did n't exist , it was either 3rd reich or generalgouvernement . 
  naming it polish implies these camps were ran by poles . 
  belarus . 
  it kinda makes me feel in same way as south korean , 
  ehem , these camps were german , not polish . 
   `` the united nations genocide convention defines it as `` acts committed with intent to destroy , ** in whole or in part ** , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group '' ^ [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide ) well , that 's the definition i 'm sticking to . 
  how does holodomor qualifies then ? 
  he purposely starved to death 8 million eastern ukrainian peasants ( unoficially 13 ) , then repopulated the region with ethnic russians . 
  part of that region was retaken in last 2 years . 
  he also murdered over 100 thousand members of polish minority during the great terror in 1937 . 
  just fyi , law and justice party is n't far right , they 're social-conservatists . 
  however they are hungry for retaking all the power , just like former ruling party , and they 're more arrogant while doing this . 
  just because some thug from bottom of society beaten up muslim woman , it does n't reflect view on matter of average pole . 
  were not like russia , we do n't have any groups walking around and hunting foreighners to beat . 
  most people here are against settling migrants , mostly because of pragmatic reasons . 
  we know what happens in asylum centers , and we see that large percent of migrants came to leech of social benefits and they are hostile towards non-muslim women . 
  there is actually quite big support for controlled inflow of actual refugees who have confirmed background , especially towards syrian christians . 
  unfortunately arrogant demands for unconditional relocation , from eu politicians like martin schultz , does n't help the matter . 
  it only fuels our polish stubborness . 
  my apologize , for editorializing the title , but the original one did n't exposed article message well . 
  what are you talking about , are you refering to immigration crysis ? 
  he proclaimed himself christian , but mostly for political reasons . 
  he did n't have trouble wiping out clergy in poland , he also planned to took control over the german catholic church after the war . 
  terrible to hear that , unfortunately there are still bigots here , mostly in lower class , stadium hooligans and some minor far right groups . 
  if these were the homeowners , they probably flushed her out because they jumped on conclusion she came here to reclaim their property . 
  in past decade there were few notorious cases where due to bureaucratic mess , some families lost their houses to inheritors of people who fled to west germany during communist days . 
  where ? 
  yes , the uneducated workers and small farmers would be spared , since they would not be able to pass on polish identity onto their peers . 
  polish culture would be erased from history just like old prussians . 
  that 's one of the main reasons why many poles still hold anti-german sentiment . 
  it was . 
  gestapo along with german minority milita were relocating poles and overtaking their assets , and executing by thousands civil servants , intellectuals and clergy . 
  all within first months of occupation . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_tannenberg https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_ab-aktion_in_poland, 
  i 'm not trying to defend them at any chance . 
  i just do n't get it why you 're raising this issue on international forum . 
  by presenting to the world warped image of poland , you 're giving extra arguements to those trying to blackmail polish nation as antisemites and nazi collaborators . 
  just because somewhere in poland exists small group of bigots . 
  what you 've just said proves well how succesfully russian news outlets are controlled by kremlin . 
  by your logic greek is more slavic than poland . 
  and where did you take your info were mostly eat fast foods ? 
  how does it feel to shit on family nest , eh ? 
  these guys are not nazis , they 're nationalists whos saluting has nothing to do with hitler or nsdap , it just part of their twisted tradition . 
  they do this , because roman salute was widely used by pre-war right wing movements . 
  this gesture is currently forbidden by polish law . 
   all sort of stolen stuff from germany ends up there we say thing about stuff that got lost during the war , that it ended up in germany . 
  first time i heard about custard , however sugar is sometimes used on potato pancakes . 
  i use ketchup :d, 
  [ we even plan to go further with it ] ( http://pzdata.cdn.aikelo.com/pzdata2/images/41066 ), 
   they dont like us much for some reason what makes you think that ? 
  at worst , we do n't care that much about czech . 
  built ? 
  no , its population began identifying as prussian around xviii century , after partitions of poland . 
  prior to that it was multicultural city , due to being part of hanseatic league , independent from teutonic order . 
   they can not into space . 
  [ yes we can ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros\u0142aw_hermaszewski ), 
  charging spots blocked by clueless drivers . 
  not many people here heard about tesla yet . 
  no exhumation happened yet to back up these revelations . 
  `` yurop '' - one of dumbest words i 've run on the internet . 
  pis is too soft to be called nationalistic , they 're power hungry bureaucrats just like former ruling party po . 
  they just happen to be more conservative on social matters . 
  if they were true patriots would at least tried to improve economic situation of poland instead using it as tool to grab more voters . 
  do you actually listen to electronic music ? 
  kraftwerk and daft punk stand so far away within ' electronic spectrum , only thing they have in common is the fact both used synthesizers . 
  what 's next , you 'll accuse sex pistols over ripping off the beatles ? 
  cringed hard . 
  thanks for making me chuckle , you bastard . 
  add to that 4chan , white supremacists , and holocaust deniers . 
  would be funnier without captions . 
  found canadian !, 
  nah , the whole building looks like a glitched screen on commodore 64 . 
  ah , so he actually was state capitalist , my bad . 
  in same way stalin was perfect socialist . 
  nazi germany began executing polish intelligentsia and ruling class shortly after overtaking poland , months before first concentration camps were formed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligenzaktion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_ab-aktion_in_poland, 
  i was too young back then to care , lol . 
  i kind of wonder how this rock shifted in such way over millions of years . 
  [ i get it . 
  ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/731/143/3e3.jpg ) btw you do n't mind architecture photos from all around the europe , which are as relevand and `` low effort '' as my submission . 
  i feel european in context of sharing same cultural christian background with other europeans , but it all ends here . 
  my worldview and mindset differs from that one of `` model '' eu citizen , and i 'm not interested in becoming one  however i would n't call myself eurosceptic , i 'm supporter of economic integration . 
  as for / r/europe i 'd rather hang out here than other americo-centric subreddits , i 'm more interested what 's happening in neighbouring countries . 
  [ if you call yourself electronic music fan , but have n't heard yet of belgian new beat - well , radio soulwax has small lesson to teach you !, 
  ] ( https://vimeo.com/26149028 ) but for real , while this genre was forgotten quite fast , it partially carried development of underground dance scene in europe , and even could carry it all alone , in case of house and techno would not being born on us dancefloors . 
  it also influenced upcoming rave genres like 2nd wave techno , trance and gabber . 
  lol no way , thankfully we have belarus and ukraine as buffer zone .
