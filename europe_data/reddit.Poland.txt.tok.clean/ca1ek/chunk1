and now you 're eating caek, 
  nothing changed . 
  i was in the kindergarten after we joined the eu . 
  it was same nightmare . 
  once my friend ate half of the soup and coul n't do more , teacher forced it into him , and he vomited , causing other to vomit and starting a chain reaction that resulted in the intervention of someone from the ministry and replacing most of the staff hired before the revolution . 
  95 % less cracks and pirated programs . 
  ( with viruses included ), 
   black starting with upper case totally german . 
  i like their handwriting . 
  i would like you more if you were n't so toxic in multiplayer video games ( e.g. 
  csgo ), 
   what the fuck , maygarorisohabhdjgfjhtag ? 
  you obviously forgot about the classics , ale urwa\u0142 and jestem hardkorem . 
  ca n't provide links on mobile . 
  pretty ~ ~ kgb ~ ~ accurate . 
  no dhl ? 
  can i pick up my kgb myself ? 
  can i order some kgb ? 
  preferred shipping time is 6 am next morning . 
  poor me . 
  send me money pls . 
  oh germany , will you ever learn ? 
  i 've got bad news for you ... 
  you just have demolishing warsaw in your genes . 
  * polish : ministry of foreign affairs is asking poles to return from egypt and blocks flights to it because of the revolution, 
  come to poland !, 
  your monument is already here !, 
  e-i will e-apply for e-residence in e-estonia . 
  there are sithteen of them . 
  i do n't know if you can watch it from other countries but polish tvp has http://tvpstream.tvp.pl/ and an ios/android/and i think also windows phone app . 
  you would n't drink a couple of liters of water at once even if you were very thirsty . 
  they will secure it in a way so viruses do n't work ... 
  the great firewall ver 2.0, 
  emulate or simulate ? 
  not stop . 
  it was `` poland sucks american dick '', 
  not stop . 
  it was `` poland sucks american dick '', 
  northerners of poland . 
   with interest rate right now at 1,2 % 1 . put the money in an investment 2 . profit !!, 
  edit : or rather : kurwa ma\u0107 ja pierdol\u0119 !, 
  i live in ~ 300,000 ppl city . 
  though it 's the second densest city in poland ( 2882 people/km \u00b2 ) it feels like a populated city only in the centre . 
  [ maybe it 's because average view looks like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@53.1085697,23.1240101,3a,75y,250.63h,93.83t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sg0rwsi4myatf-jktb6odna!2e0?hl=pl ), 
  like nsa does n't have access to everything . 
  i 'm pretty sure they can break pgp encryption , but still in an awful long time ( i guess about 5 years ) , but they ca n't filter these for `` interesting '' phrases so they wo n't take that task unless someone said something `` interesting '' without tor & pgp . 
  because russian or chinese coal costs less than our own . 
  apple salad , no power needed , apples wont go to waste !, 
  genius !, 
  poland not into use of petrol/gas into power . 
  poland has coal , poland use coal . 
  but really , if they completely stop exporting gas we will have a reserve for just half the winter . 
  i live in a city that gets heating also from coal so no big deal to me , i just wo n't be able to cook at home , but i have a electrical stove somewhere ... 
  they still send enough gas for our use , we had too much of it so we sent it to ukraine , and now we ca n't . 
  we wanted to colonize madagascar , and they thought that we were only nation that does n't want to colonize anyone . 
  we would colonize them if not the war . 
  yeah , but they can count the containers and volume or just dump it all on a weight and get the answer at once . 
  and , it 's close to russia , and whenever something is closer to russia weirder it gets . 
  including my native , i really can speak two but i 'm learning the third one . 
  i 'm neutral about it , but there is a lot of graffiti on the streets saying `` kosovo is serbia '' . 
  they recorded that bollywood movie in poland and it 's visible next to `` tusk chuj '' ( or something like that , may get translated to `` fuck the tusk [ our prime minister ] '' ) . 
  i do n't think someone would think out of a decentralized network of computers just for civilians . 
  maybe a centralized one , but never a decentralized . 
  maybe russia wants to annex you too ? 
  because you should n't compare countries directly but as military per sq meter or something . 
   deveselu oh , i talked about the one in poland . 
  and , i searched the google for info and it seems like we will have one too . 
  wait ... 
  they did n't abandon it ? 
  who would measure the volume of so much milk ? 
  but polan no sell if not belarus . 
  polan and belarus winner !, 
   lack of military well , latvia , lithuania and estonia got 3 tanks collectively , but poland has 120,000 active military and 515,000 in reserve ( according to wikipedia ) is that a `` lack '' ? 
  of marines ? 
  and it 's just the soldiers we got on duty all the time , there are more available just in reserves just in case . 
  edit : and wikipedia says that we got even more soldiers than in this infographic . 
  120,000 active and 515,000 reserve . 
  they 're both polish , the guy on the left is the minister of national defence and the guy on the right is our president . 
  not really the leader , but a minister of national defence , the president is next to him . 
   izraelczyk does n't sound right to me . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's different, 
   is vietnamese food widely available in poland ? 
  well , we import instant noodles from vietnam . 
  this one is quite common in poland . 
   he is still considered hero here because at the time he was our only chance for freedom . 
  mirror please . 
  you do n't joke about war . 
  rusian , not russian . 
  but they are belarusian , unless belarusian people = russian people it 's ok . 
  same in bia\u0142ystok ( 80 km from belarus border ) , on some days you ca n't even hear anyone chatting in polish . 
  did n't auchan use a brand that has no connection to that name ? 
  [ this is how almost all of the auchan produts look like in poland ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vtnigqgl2ms/uax0rrykzsi/aaaaaaaac9k/3frpvvqtj60/s1600/dsc09467.jpg ), 
  and if it 's somehow limited then make a base for 1 year , then move take the units out and back in and call it a new base . 
  at least for once we wo n't be the one gangbanged . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ hope ^ ^ so . 
  almost . 
  if you got a letter it will sound exactly the same in every single word , but a few of them sound differently when alone than when in a word . 
  for example , when you tell `` b '' alone you make [ be ] sound , but in a word for example `` budynek '' ( that 's building in english ) the letters `` bu '' make [ bu ] sound , and in `` bierz '' ( en : take it ) `` bi '' makes [ bi ] sound . 
  you just ca n't tell the letter alone , it 's spelled with another letter , and if you tell the letter itself you put the `` e '' as some sort of placeholder .
