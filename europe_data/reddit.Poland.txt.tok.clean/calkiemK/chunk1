chill . 
  there are idiots in every country . 
  it 's a opinion . 
  from 2011 . 
  before nsa . 
  about telephone billing laws . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  seems like russia wants to guard west of ukraine too . 
  just you wait for urinating jesus !, 
  apparently i 'm more finnish than you !, 
  well that was worth watching . 
  thank you . 
  i have no idea why you 're getting downvoted . 
  sooooo if cuba decides to join a defensive pact with russia . . 
  us should invade mexico . 
  got it . 
  usa is n't forcing anyone into nato . 
  it 's getting closer to russias borders because of how russia acts and the deep distrust it causes . 
  russia invades ukraine and you suggest it 's nato fault ? 
  how ? 
  without nato russia would go after every country in eastern europe . 
  because london is n't in europe . 
  obviously . 
  or at least come up with a different excuse . 
  probably not . 
  some people actually believe putins bullshit . 
  stop . 
  just ... just stop . 
  it matters more than you think !, 
  [ poland is ranked 38 in the corruption perceptions . 
  ] ( http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/ ) not bad . 
  voivodships were changed to help with eu funds . 
  other than that i agree with you . 
  more often than not i see that ` all is bad ' mentality making people unproductive and lazy . 
  not a good thing . 
  we 're not all like this ... 
  i had to stop watching any polish media because of this . 
  it 's quite bizarre when everything around you is getting better and yet most people keep complaining that it is n't . 
  i 've seen poland change in the last 10 years . 
  i look forward to our future . 
  of genius . 
  i can only add that europe can have nukes without any problem as a consequence of high russian infamy caused by a lack of cassus belli . 
  none the less the more i look at this map the more i see how europe is great and both us and russia are evil . 
  now excuse me i have a toilet to fix . 
  add a paradox game reference and something about that one subreddit that we all read , but ca n't discuss outside of it . 
  you got yourself a top rated comment . 
  seems to be working for russia . 
  as shocking as the headline seems , he does make some good points . 
  pretty common in poland too . 
  your comment is actually spot-on . 
  people who are protesting mostly do n't understand our situation and their demands , if meet , would only worsen their own situation in a couple of years . 
  it 's hard to do unpopular but necessary reforms in poland . 
  that 's not ** evidence ** . 
  that 's ** conjecture ** . 
  it is . 
  i want to see how many upvotes will it get regardless , 
  strong evidence : `` syrian regime is the only one with chemical weapons and the means to deliver them '' . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  you said something not so great about israel . 
  you will be called a antisemite . 
  and then get downvoted by the jewish internet defense force . 
  can we please not use ` war on . . ' anymore ? 
  about the people who lost their lives in the war . 
  there are two stereotypes spawned by nazi propaganda that annoy me the most . 
  france , as incompetent in warfare , and poland with cavalry charges against tanks . 
  both so easy to check and yet both alive and well . 
  well the soviets brought an entire union ... 
  sure you can !, 
  i 'm sorry , you do n't have enough karma for that . 
  such is life . 
  not a bad deal , you can exchange polish internet fame points ^ tm for pierogi ... 
  futski , friend ... why would you into space and leave me ? 
  why ? 
  i meant in the last comment ... :d, 
  your user name is ... appropriate ... 
  yes , well ... we got the sequel !, 
  oh man . . am i living here illegally now ? 
  you can actually , 
  we do n't talk about pb outside pb ... 
  agreed , companies do n't move to germany to avoid high taxed . 
  but i did ' t say they do . 
  and yes , this is getting offtopic . 
  to the point :  you can tell by the barcode . 
  you ca n't . 
  company may have hq in x country for reasons like lower taxes or prestige . 
  from that country they can get barcodes . 
  company itself and all production can at the same time be somewhere else . 
  the barcode tells you the country of numbering organization that allocated this code , not where the product is from . 
  one of my favourites is : w dupie by\u0142e\u015b , g\u00f3wno widziales - you were in ass , you saw shit ( meaning you saw nothing ), 
  flair up , 
  i was thinking about macau . 
  i have this feeling that if we let this go i will start seeing us drones all over europe , doing some security killing on eu citizens . 
  because , why not ? 
  we 're not protesting over this , we wo n't ever . 
  nah . . that 's different , when you submit to usa it 's freedom . 
  it 's actually a programmers congress ... 
  go for the bigger union with more independence , 
  france and uk , we already know why . 
  poland ? 
  maybe cia prisons , maybe our us ass kissing in general .
