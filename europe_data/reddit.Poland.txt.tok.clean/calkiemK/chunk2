  bottom line , i have some phone calls to make . 
  who is n't ? 
  thanks for pointing this out , i 'm smarter now , 
  let 's use our weapons of mass destruction ^ tm, 
  why does n't iceland want to join eu ? 
  i do n't care for all that post-war drama , except for one thing to remember : war is hell . 
  i all also have zero bad feelings towards germans . 
  hell , i am annoyed by all the shit you have to hear about evil germans etc. 
  just one thing :  your land was conquered in what , a day or so ( ? ), 
  1 month and 5 days, 
  i know you are , 
  that would make it a bad thing for germany . 
  so , it 's look like a pr stunt . 
  merkel stood up to putin - good publicity in germany and europe . 
  putin rejects arrogant european demand proving that he is a strong leader - good publicity in russia . 
  comments on articles about snowden , news reports etc. 
  hell , even facebook . 
  most importantly - he has been charged with espionage . 
  if american people considered him a hero , that would never had happened . 
  government should pardon him and say he can go back to us without fear . 
  that , unfortunately , did n't happen . 
   i do n't know why you wish ill on my country that 's the thing . 
  i do n't . 
  i want us to be what is used to be , i wish you the best . 
  i just lost hope that it will happen . 
  i did n't . 
  i said `` almost every american '' . 
  i would be glad if you correct my view , really . 
  but so far from what i can see a vast majority of us citizens consider snowden a traitor . 
  i like to think that europe just got a waking call and we will fix this mess . 
  i do n't think the same will happen in usa . 
  this happens whenever trying to describe a wider group of people . 
  so far almost every american whose opinion on this subject i know is defending nsa and calling snowden a traitor . 
  so yes , in my eyes americans are people who tortured bradley manning and now want to torture snowden . 
  if that 's not you , then please accept my sincere apologies . 
  i found a loophole for you . 
  place of stay abroad : not slovakia . 
  :d also , it is vetoed , so what 's the problem ? 
   you ca n't tell me that the excuse of `` others are doing the same thing '' is exclusively an american thing do you see the irony ? 
  here 's the thing . 
  if russia has to return art to germany , then germany has no right to hold anything looted in ww2 and should return it without any problems , delays etc. 
  my logic in this is : russia could claim that the art in question is war reparations . 
  germany did surrender , so let 's say they did agree to that . 
  so , if that 's not enough to hold on to looted art , then germany has absolutely no right to hold on to any art they might have from ww2 . 
  i 'm not saying that germans are not returning stolen art . 
  to the best of my knowledge they are . 
  but that 's just something to keep in mind . 
  when you ask others for something , be prepared to do the same thing . 
  you know who us was bullying ? 
  google , microsoft , apple etc. 
  companies that hold our data . 
  that 's the problem . 
  imagine eu making volkswagen install listening devices in every car sold outside of europe and send that data to every intelligence agency in europe . 
  no problem , right ? 
  i do n't understand americans . 
  why the hell are you defending nsa ? 
  they are breaking your laws , lying to your congress and just do n't give a fuck . 
  charging snowden with espionage is more or less a sign of your governments stance on subject . 
  nsa is ok . exposing breaking law ? 
  nope , you go to jail for that . 
  and by jail i mean torture . 
  and here you are going with one of two favorite american excuses `` others are doing the same thing '' . 
  stop it , just stop . 
  think for a second what your country is and what it used to be . 
  why are you defending this ? 
  \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka is $ 4,5  wyborowa is actually quite good . 
  if you have n't already - try it . 
  anyway you have the best wine in the world so there 's that :d, 
  thanks , 
  i 'm just gon na stay neutral on this one , 
  but there is an awful lot of cameras in the uk . 
  almost 2 million if i recall correctly . 
  what nonsense specifically ? 
  i did not know that , thank you . 
  what i had in mind was more about mentality . 
  when authorities are invading privacy , it 's fine . 
  but when people ask questions about what are elected representatives doing and why . . nope . 
  you ca n't do that . 
  interesting . 
  country with surveillance cameras everywhere . 
  i guess it 's government watching citizens , and never the other way around . 
  did i say it is ? 
  because of how arrogant and egocentric you tend to be . 
  and this is why people hate you . 
  thanks for answering , 
  thank you for taking the time to respond , 
  thanks for corrections  my mistake about ireland being not very fertile may be a result of reading about introduction of potatoes in europe . 
  my understanding is that potato ( much like in poland ) is a perfect fit for climate/soil and allowed for significant production boost in agriculture . 
  that must have left me with the wrong impression , sorry for that  about ww2 . 
  i am fully aware of how torn ireland was between joining allies and remaining neutral . 
  the possibility of nazi germany invading ireland was very real and very scary . 
  not to mention u-boots all around you . 
  and yet , thousands brave soldiers left irish army and joined british . 
  calling them deserters in a great injustice . 
  glad they finally get pardons .
