  i 'm saying that even though you recognize germany 's role in these events , some germans do n't and you can to some extent relate to them . 
  i 'm not saying you agree with them or support them , but i do think your dismissal of their beliefs should be stronger . 
   it 's a diplomatic necessity to remain calm and try to figure things out without saber ratteling . 
  germany 's doing just that . 
  however , that is not going against polish interests . 
  it 's just a good cop , bad cop situation . 
  to accomplish ... what , exactly ? 
  there is nothing to figure out . 
  if all that theater is just for show , then who is it supposed to mislead ? 
  who does n't know that setting up the bases is a defensive measure ? 
  that we are not going to use them to invade anyone ? 
  if this is about pr , then why are n't we presenting it as a response to russian military interventions in georgia and the ukraine ? 
  nah , i 'm not buying this at all . 
  nato is n't moving the bases , because both , usa and germany , know it would generate them additional expenses . 
   looking forward to accepting reality and living in peace should have done that about 70 years ago . 
   what do you want germans to do about the bdv ? 
  stop supporting them entirely . 
  their beliefs should n't be socially acceptable . 
   citing the bdv as a major problem is just too much . 
  read my comment again . 
  i explicitly said it 's `` small '' . 
   they never found any hate for poland if you think hating poland for this is even a possibility , then you do n't get it . 
  you did n't lose your homes because poland mistreated you . 
  you lost them because you started a war that ultimately lead to borders being redrawn and people being displaced . 
  you were n't the victims . 
  if any of you want to hate someone for this , you should be hating yourself . 
   where were we ever against polish interests , especially regarding russia ? 
  you do n't have to look far for an example . 
  nato bases in poland . 
  the `` let 's not provoke russia '' thing is a bullshit excuse . 
  nobody , including russia , thinks nato is going to attack russia . 
  that threat just does n't exist . 
  nothing we do can truly provoke them . 
  germany does n't want the bases to move further east because that would force you to increase defense spending and right now you are not even fulfilling your [ current nato obligations ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/15/news/nato-spending-countries/ ) . 
  yes , it does . 
  the fact , that this sort of sentiment is effectively mainstream , bothers me . 
  it 's not particularly popular , but it 's socially acceptable to hold these sort of views and it should n't be . 
  we have people who think we deserve some sort of compensation from ukraine for their western lands , for the bandera slaughters . 
  when you find these people , see who they are , you are going to find a bunch of bald meatheads . 
  we do n't even have an organized movement representing these sort of claims . 
  in germany , you can be in cdu or spd and hold these sort of views and nobody seems to notice how messed up that is . 
  it should be something far more fringe , than the people who want compensations from ukraine are here , because , you know , you are responsible for the war that caused these displacements of people . 
   as long as they do n't really bother ~ ~ anybody ~ ~ any germans , we do nothing against them . 
  i fixed that for you . 
  i know , that 's why i said dealing with them is `` something small '' . 
  i 'm saying the methods of dealing with bdv and dealing with pis are generally similar - `` support them less '' , do n't give them money , do n't vote for their people , etc. . 
  i do n't consider that to be a good analogy . 
  people who vote for the wrong party are completely responsible for their actions . 
  it 's something that they do . 
  sickness usually is n't something you do , it 's something that happens to you . 
  saying `` i 'll get better '' when you are sick , means you are hoping that something that is n't entirely under your control will happen to you . 
  saying `` i 'll get getter '' when it comes to voting , means you acknowledge you had done something wrong before and that you are going to fix it . 
  talking about some vague sickness does n't have that clear regretful acknowledgment of personal responsibility , of failure . 
  it usually is n't apologetic , because one 's health is n't something we are so clearly and totally responsible for . 
   ** we ** will get better again . 
  that 's how he phrased it . 
  ensuring germans we will fix our anti-german attitudes , does . 
   just because one despises the pis government means you are apologetic and subservient . 
  if you feel the need to ensure germans that we will recover from it , like / u/pothkan did , it kinda does mean you are being apologetic and subservient . 
   do you even know what does that word mean ? 
  do you ? 
  definition :  [ expressing or showing regretful acknowledgement of an offence or failure ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/apologetic ) and you were being apologetic here :  [ not all of us . 
  we will ** get better again ** . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4oko2r/germany_and_poland_celebrate_25_year_anniversary/d4dyeqv ), 
   such as a sewage ? 
  such as an increased capacity to provide services for germany and to consume german goods . 
   i do n't think that germany `` fucks over '' poland on so many issues but even if we did , there is no underlying hate and resentment against you like it was back then . 
  :d so , you are saying you might be screwing us over , but this time around , you are not doing it on purpose ? 
  that 's such an improvement from our perspective !, 
  now that i know that , i totally should n't be upset about being screwed over . 
   and how do you presume to deal with the bund der vertriebenen ? 
  maybe do the same thing you expect us to do with pis ? 
  support them less . 
  if you were n't worth that investment the money would be going to some other country . 
  you are getting it , because you are supposed to be profitable in the long term . 
  this is n't about sympathy . 
  it 's not a gift . 
  this is the sort of relationship a person has with their stockbroker . 
  you are providing a service . 
  i obviously meant getting more tangible things in return for one 's ` gift ' than a ` thank you ' and a warm feeling in one 's heart . 
  being apologetic to germans because of pis is pathetic . 
  the germans are not being humble when they do things against our interests . 
  they just do them . 
  this sort of subservient mentality of some poles is disgusting . 
  still do n't see how any of this implies `` so spreading propaganda about evul merkelreich makes on unpathetic ? '', 
   dignity , sovereignty , nation - these are all items from two centuries ago . 
  if you say so , it must be true . 
  maybe one day you 'll realize your `` sewage '' was n't a gift , but was an investment . 
  never said anything like that . 
  try again . 
  are you one of these friendly germans i keep hearing about ? 
  i guess being pathetic can get you some sympathy and that pity can later turn into friendship . 
   i 'm pretty disappointed that the polish people fell so hard for pis and all their anti-german sentiments and i 'm perpetually surprised that there are poles who are not anti-german . 
  you keep fucking us over on every international issue that is important to us ( like energy , like nato ) and then call our relationship a friendship and demand things in return . 
  ` in return ' for what exactly ? 
  who knows . 
  and then you are surprised we do n't like you and , again , treat our grievances as if they were entirely unreasonable and unfounded . 
  yeah , you are such awesome friends to us . 
  if you actually want to begin to appear friendly , you can start with something small , like dealing with these bund der vertriebenen cunts . 
  explain to them how fucking retarded their demands are and point out that they should generally be grateful that , all these decades ago , we had n't done to them what they would have done to us .
