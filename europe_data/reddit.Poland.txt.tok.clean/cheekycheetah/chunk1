yeah welsh is indigenous language of british islands, 
  likely scots and irish as well ... so probably i meant english people . 
  nowadays corporations and malicious lawyers took over these roles in germany . 
  their government is lazy fluffy teddy bear . 
  i 've noticed some brits are pretentious about having learnt french in the past but except just few words have n't heard one speaking french fluently , lol . 
  yup , keep them away from anyplace where eu-wide internet policies are created, 
  that 's better, 
  oh dear ... but you do get spied on anyway to an extend i have n't met in other eu countries , you happily submit , and the internet is not at fault at all - * meldegesetz * , * rundfunkbeitrag * , schufa , copyright trolls . 
  in the internet at least one have the choice . 
  she 's almost 90 now, 
  there are brits who speak foreign languages ? 
  i 'm just listing potential reasons of the high share of lone parent families in poland . 
  some might perceive these reasons as `` blaming '' , i have no problem with it . 
  if it helps , in the circle of my family and acquaintances there are examples of each from the above . 
  poland : virtually no paternal leave , miserable healthcare and job market ( males dying prematurely from stress , dieseases , and suicides ) , males emigrating alone oftentimes resulting with divorces , single mothers with no-strings-attached reproductor fathers from spain/italy and other `` exotic '' countries . 
  yeah , the term ee is oftentimes used a an ethnic slur, 
  the more affluent and influential region treats `` the other region '' as a dump , even though oftentimes they are partially at fault of the bad situation there . 
  this happens as well in e.g. 
  italy ( it 's always south 's fault ) , germany ( it 's always east 's fault ) . 
  so everything is okay and the situation is under control because `` it 's them '' . 
  for it in italy 1200-1600 euro net monthly . 
  1600 net is considered a good salary . 
  even more ? 
  just take my entire salary already . 
  first world problems ... oh wait, 
  well someone have to get all this sex , because reddit does n't get too much i 'm afraid, 
  recent years it has been the last demographic boom creating families , so this miserable fertility is the highest , will be only lower . 
  `` they do n't want what we want so they are stupid '', 
  what if the only thing which keeps a person in the location is job ? 
  with no perspective of settling there , buying property , creating family ? 
  stop being poor . 
  ^ ^ haha ^ ^ joking ^ ^ you 'll ^ ^ not ^ ^ stop ^ ^ even ^ ^ if ^ ^ you 'll ^ ^ do ^ ^ your ^ ^ best now got back to work !, 
  ps1 i 'm going for maternity leave ... then holidays ... then educational leave ... ps2 there will be no raises this year , eastern european department is causing losses * ~ your managers in the headquarters *, 
  no , they would n't, 
   one reported incident , does not make germany a `` top anti-semitic country '' people in germany were in denial about terrorist threat before december 2016 as well . 
   on a side note whats up with your constant shitposting about germany ? 
  when ever there is a thread about my country i see you bitching and moaning . 
  lol . 
  if you like my comments do n't hesitate to subscribe . 
   the school said that after the first incident was reported , it had invited `` phillip 's '' grandparents , who witnessed the holocaust , to talk to his class holocaust was an `` european thing '' , you 'll not `` enblame '' arabs and turks because they live in your country now by telling them what you have done 75 years ago . 
  for them the conflict with jews started with the foundation of israel and little they have to do with the preceding events . 
  yes , by convoluted turn of events germany again is becoming the top anti-semitic country in europe . 
  it 's so entertaining to watch this . 
  i do n't think the `` anonymity '' and `` privacy '' hysteria will ever catch up outside of germany . 
  do n't you feel bad for increasing the piracy rates of other countries ? 
  remember to seed !, 
  what a shithole of a country and a paradise for predatory and parasitic trolls . 
  if there is something germans are terrified of and completely incompetent in , it 's the internet . 
   that surely is going to be the elephant in the room  the fact that theresa may is not there the question is correct and clear . 
  the response is just disrespectful . 
  `` i am the senior here , do n't you try being snarky '' . 
  [ now donald has his place in the history , although probably not the one he wished for . 
  i have n't met anyone in poland negating expulsion of germans . 
  in the circumstances of those times it was the right thing to do . 
  i see that rewriting the history is doing well . 
  go on . 
  you will not find any pity in poland for whatever happened to germans in '40s . 
  it 's just not going to happen . 
  ever . 
   does n't acknowledge rising inequalities the old `` no worries , the wealth will trickle down '' mantra . 
  the point is poland could do the same as czechoslovakia or even worse - nobody would bat an eye . 
  yet we choose only to expel them . 
  germans should learn to recognize mercy when it 's given to them . 
  subcontract pls . 
  ^ ^ this ^ ^ explains ^ ^ permanent ^ ^ german ^ ^ butthurt ^ ^ over ^ ^ anything ^ ^ happening ^ ^ in ^ ^ us, 
  you 're welcome . 
  know our mercy . 
   polish annexation of german territory after ww2 `` annexed '' lol . 
  what else ? 
  did they expel innocent germans as well ? 
  silly expansionist poland . 
  so ... human lives have been intentionally sacrified just to exercise the laws into the extreme and to provoke their necessary reform ? 
  until recently someone else had been `` the leader of polish opposition '' , no idea why the bets have changed, 
   authorities ignored their calls for his deportation , saying such a move was legally impossible . 
  yes it 's illegal , you can not do it . 
  now you have to change the game rules while the game is on ... and remember - you are shuffling people around it 's not just `` logistics '' . 
  they will be desperate and pissed off , if you pay them to leave it 's basically rewarding migrants ' behaviour - voters will hate it . 
  it comes way too easy for you germany to shuffle people around , have fun . 
  they react with aggression each time a \u0160koda car arrives, 
  when during '90s in poland we had a significant influx of romanian gypsies , this is exactly how i imagined romania :d, 
  me no spiking inglese , for germany and sweden turn left on the next intersection, 
  these statistics are not an excuse for such a triumphant self-satisfaction . 
  averages are very high , correct , but assets and resources are not distributed accordingly or even are `` leaking '' out , some deals in place are exploitive so those on the `` best and most happy '' side can write such bollocks as in the article . 
  i would say that in general the situation in eu is ok-ish . 
   the happiest people live in : europe . 
  suicide rates in post-communist countries ? 
   the cities most worth living in are in : europe . 
  gloomy concrete blocks in post-communist countries ? 
  run down cities in the medditerranean ? 
   the best health care is in : europe . 
  poland , romania , greece ?!, 
  the above are written by someone from his/her apartment in zurich , munich , or frankfurt overlooking the lake or a park . 
  i 'm happy for your `` best and most happy '' life but i can not afford to rent in these places . 
   tired , old , worn out -- that was the image many europeans had of their continent . 
  tired , old , worn out was how most speeches about the e.u. 
  sounded . 
  because some parts of europe are ( demographically ) tired , old , worn out ... and increasingly desperate as it looks . 
   while the polish government is becoming increasingly authoritarian and nationalistic , ryszard petru , currently the most important leader of the opposition germans , please stop trying to install your puppets in poland . 
  stop . 
  immediately .
