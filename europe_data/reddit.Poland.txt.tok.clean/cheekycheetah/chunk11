  anyone younger than them emigrated long time ago or is busy working and paying off the mortgage . 
   are you really this retarded or just pretending ? 
  you convinced me . 
  i yield . 
   50 % votes , just something between 30 and 40 % , which was enough to win . 
  it leaves the majority angry . 
  this is the case for all democratic elections in poland ever . 
  some really can not stand lawful results of valid democratic elections, 
  funny because slavic mythology has been present in american pop-culture at least since the birth of the hollywood . 
  how do they find good english speakers ( or rather writers ) in macedonia ? 
  in various english proficiency rankings fyrom is not even listed . 
  a troll factory in sweden or norway - this i would believe . 
  yes of course i am !, 
  my point is he is screaming at buzek ( and ordering him , the president of the parliament ) for not being able to maintain `` an order '' . 
   if heaven finds out that  slavic demons are busting out  we 'll never recover form sanctions good one, 
  this is a low barrier to be scream at by this persons as germans have very broad definition of `` racism '' . 
  [ actually , it 's enough to not be able to maintain `` an order '' .

  i 'm pissed off , it 's my time !, 
  it 's really surprising to me how efficiently polish courts can withstand against the u.s. ' demands . 
  in other cases ( e.g. 
  cia black sites ) the polish authorities are usually rather subservient . 
   1 ) what poles did for jews in wwii ? 
  well , surely more than american jews . 
  one can get an impression that the only american jews interested in the fate of their european brothers in faith was the [ jewish mob ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meyer_lansky#world_war_ii_involvement ) . 
  i 'm not surprised by uk at all . 
  one can feel it from a short travel there . 
  everything is so expensive . 
  airport shuttle , restaurants , hotels , trains , public transport ( london ! ) . 
  why worry about services for peasants when one can focus on the highest earners and earn the same profit with less stress and effort ? 
  not at all , and on top of it * smolensk * is at least cheap pulp - the opposite of german tv 's pulp . 
   1 ) what poles did for jews in wwii ? 
  well , surely more than american jews . 
    2 ) why so many jews remember and speak about polish anti-semitism , not a german ? 
  because those are alive . 
  this looks like a beginning of series of new kind of anegdotes . 
  my try on it : 1 ) how many israelis died in concentration camps during wwii ? 
  there are a lot of jewish related phenomenons rooted in baltic states and poland as these two had been the center of jewish world for centuries in the past . 
  the * smolensk * movie is at the level of pulp served by the german tv so they are just trying to cater to local tastes . 
  one hardly hears abroad about polish history or culture in context different than jewish . 
  although jewish heritage is an important part of polish heritage , it 's indeed only part of it . 
  it 's hard to expect that we ( poles ) keep promoting it even though israelis themselves are not particularly interested . 
  one can get an impression they are interested exclusively in visiting auschwitz museum and occasionally in posing reparation demands . 
  yes , and ? 
   people of warsaw had gone through the same as the inhabitants of aleppo nowadays . 
  no they had n't . 
  quit trying to convince me with lazy comparisons and pictures of dead children . 
  the stealing of `` arbeit macht frei '' sign from auschwitz museum couple of years ago was commissioned by a swede . 
  scandinavians and their weird hobbies . 
  what would be the codeword for ` moldy ' ? 
  why is it so easy to gain months of time , roaming freely across the entire freaking schengen area , by `` not having papers '' ? 
  [ we have something similar ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fpl.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fkarta_rowerowa&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  pity that bicycle commuting culture is not promoted here as it is in netherlands . 
  i have no idea what you meant , e.g. 
  athens and prague have the above without royal families and monarchy . 
  tourism ?!, 
  are they on the display somehow , how much is the ticket to see the royal family , is touching included ? 
  you do n't have catholic church in the netherlands ? 
  they do n't praise jesus as the king of the universe in the litanies ? 
  i do n't get this excitement over royal families . 
  yeah they work , have children , and stuff . 
  who cares ? 
  there is only decoration there and almost no articles - this is not how shops work , silly romanians, 
  polish made entertainment in english , except my comments on reddit , is usually bad . 
  we just do n't get the drill . 
  quite high cost of an above average economic growth and of leveling up the various `` standards '' to western levels . 
  the whole point of buying cheaper , bringing in a trunk , and selling from the back of the car or from improvised `` shop '' is the `` guerilla '' part . 
  in case one would have to comply to warranties , returns , consumer rights , official controls and audits , it would n't be cheaper anymore . 
  so how do i return an article to some smartass who is selling me stuff he brought from germany ? 
  will the producer respect the warranty ? 
  in case of food , if it gets rotten and i get poisoned , who will be responsible ? 
  what stops `` an entrepreneur '' from dillluting the liquids in bottles/jars/cans which are not properly sealed or can easily be resealed ? 
  the situation has advanced since '90s , one simply can not start bringing stuff from abroad and selling it on the street . 
  partially yes . 
  in there it 's easier to call in consumer desperation i.e. 
  use the marketing strategy * this is the unique opportunity !, 
  * , * it 's the cheapest !, 
  * , because of the traumas from the past . 
  in particular no availability or prohibitive prices ( see [ pewex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pewex ) ) . 
  the consumers are more grasping , very cheap , prone to marketing and they end up paying more for lower quality . 
  they are not productive as individuals , they are productive as employees of a particular company in particular location . 
  take some germans and hire them in outsourcing center in bucharest , or let them switch their career into a different corporation with unions and benefits granted with seniority - i would like to see their productivity then . 
   the companies , owned by the large retail company schwarz group and controlled by one of germany 's wealthiest families  the schwarz group , which started in the 1930s as a grocery wholesaler in germany , is now one of the world 's largest and fastest-growing retailers , and its head , dieter schwarz , is one of the world 's richest men , worth an estimated $ 21bn . 
  seriously , one more fucking time i ' l hear that `` capital has no nationality '' ...  the ifc defended its investments in the schwarz group , saying that its eastward expansion has `` created new channels for local farmers to supply their products . 
  the big chains are known in poland to exploit and blackmail local suppliers . 
  why not both ? 
  good luck with your stomach after eating tuna/nutella transported 12h during summer in a trunk of a car at 35 deg c , and then stored for weeks in similar conditions . 
  products need to have labels in local language . 
  there is single market and lidl/tesco/auchan / whatever take full advantage of it and operate within it , why they offer tat in some countries ? 
  the distribution should be made by people who know what they are doing and can transport the products respecting hygienical standards , and have the right tools for the job ( warehouses , refridgerator trucks , etc ) 4 . 
  this `` buy in germany , sell with profit '' `` entrepreneurship '' should die . 
   if the borders are open what is stopping some enterprising young individual with a truck from driving to aldi and loading up with superior , less expensive western produce and then driving home to sell that stuff at a modest profit ? 
  this type type of `` entrepreneurship '' was a thing in '90s , still sometimes happens , and is despicable . 
  so it 's more a result of stingy population , poor competition , and poor quality regulation/enforcement . 
  say thank you to the economic transition in the '90s when retail markets of post-communist countries were sold off to foreign entities . 
  in most eu countries the retail market is in domestic hands - the food the population consumes and the soap it uses to wash hands is a strategic thing ( de - lidl/netto/rewe / aldi , fr - leclerc/auchan/carrefour , uk - tesco/morissons/sainsbury , po - geronimo martins ) . 
  if most of the retail market belongs to foreign entities the strategy is simple - throw them tat and extract the profits abroad , occasionally humiliate them with `` promotions '' and make the videos from these `` promotions '' viral on the internet . 
  nobel peace prize !, 
  nobel peace prize !, 
  yeah ... we are gon na grow the shit out of it !,
