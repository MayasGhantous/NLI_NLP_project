  no step on snek, 
  give an example of `` far-right nationalists '' currently capable of killing the eu . 
  no , the current polish and hungarian governments are not `` far-right nationalists '' . 
  slovakia - just do n't invade poland and we 'll be fine . 
  funny how in some situations some people know exactly who the enemy is , but in other situations they appear to be in an absolute denial . 
  what 's up with this fear mongering , looking for enemies among `` far-right '' and `` nationalists '' ? 
  you really can not stand opposing viewpoints , can you ? 
  eu is here to stay . 
  no , we are not in `` unite or perish '' alternative situation . 
  and one more thing - you do n't have monopoly for europe and eu symbolics , stop usurping these because they will loose any meaning . 
  reading does n't help . 
  have you ever dealt with b\u00fcro-amt-deutsch dialect ? 
  would be empty thanks to the invisible xenophobic shield they installed !, 
  these road accidents are getting out of hand ... edit no - i mean seriously be/de/uk / fr - you should work on your road safety, 
  finland took the opportunity of a new technology ( gsm ) and made the most of it . 
  then slept over the paradigm change on the market . 
  innovation-wise nowadays even finland is on the crossroads . 
  i 'm thrilled about all these future `` smart cities '' , `` collaborative internet platform '' and `` electric car/bicycle/scooter / roller skates '' projects !, 
  tons of reports will be made , tons of forms will be filled . 
  i do n't think the number of patents is a measure of anything . 
  at this point it 's just patent hoarding , various `` apparatuses '' for `` facilitating something '' purposed exclusively for ( or as a defence against ) potential patent trolling . 
  yeah , let 's exploit them because someone else would do it and they are poor anyway !, 
  genocide here , genocide there - classic germany . 
  the best they can do is they will allow you to assemble their cars , sorry namibia . 
  romance language folks pick on portuguese that it has phonemes similar to slavic languages . 
  have you noticed how ridiculously expensive clothes are ? 
  15-20 euro t-shirt , 70-120 euro jeans , 80-200 euro winter jacket , 50-100 euro sunglasses - these cost peanuts to produce and to ship to eu . 
  if there is an industry which urgently need disruption it 's clothing industry . 
  heh , scandinavians + finland take pride in their `` equality '' and transparency of income , etc. . you still have inequality and billionaires but they move ( hide ? ), 
  their fortunes away not to dazzle the domestic population . 
  10 years old volvo in home , 100 meter yacht in sardinia . 
  sobieski should had allowed ottomans to take vienna . 
  then the partitions of polish-lithuanian commonwealth 100 years later would be less likely . 
  it was mistake to intervene . 
  someone is hoarding protest permits , run out of ideas , hence there are these marches for europe . 
  let me give you more ideas : `` march for good weather '' , `` march for being healthy '' , `` march for having money '' , `` march for being happy '' , `` march for africa '' . 
  ikea , the national pride of sweden , established part of its complex structure in liechtenstein yet i 'm not able to find any ikea shops there . 
  what a little tiny cute tax evasion place of a country . 
   work and save for most of your life being frugal and penny pinching and have quite the fortune when your 40/50 + nice that at least they have this option . 
  anywhere east and south from germany it 's being frugal , penny pinching and still having almost nothing at the age 40/50 + . 
  probably applies as well to young british population earning anywhere between gbp 12-24k per year . 
  many internal and external , political and economical forces will push poland to have more population in the following decades . 
  coal , cars are marginal issues here . 
  last time i checked scandinavia was in the subpolar region and poland on the european plain . 
   whole reason you exist is the fact that people who wanted nothing more get drugged and shitfaced had kids ( you ) and did n't give a fuck about them , surprising to absolutely no one generation raised by 60s and 70s parents gave a birth to modern day mix of fascism and communism . 
  the last demographic boom in poland happened around [ martial law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martial_law_in_poland ) - not exactly the times of fucking around , getting drugged , and shitfaced . 
  i 'm perfectly fine with people in austria not having kids though . 
  the polish `` baby boom '' is not anyone 's success , only aftermath of the demographic boom of 1980s . 
  one can chime in with pathetic 500 pln per month and declare a success , but correlation is not causation . 
  honestly , this miserable `` baby boom '' should be larger . 
  no ukrainian even half-decently speaking german or english will stay in poland . 
  polish economy is happy to receive them because they are paid less than already miserable polish salaries . 
  [ correct ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_total_fertility_rate ) . 
  post-war polish demographic boom , opposite to e.g. 
  german one , replicated around 1980 . 
  the demographic boom from 80s does not replicate ( why would one create a family while working abroad and being everywhere a guest and alien ? ) . 
  polish women living in poland simply do not have children - not a little , not rarely - they do not have children at all , they wait making some miserable career earning ~ 1000 euro net in an outsourcing center in warsaw or krakow and then in mid 30s , desperate , if still attractive enough go for some spanish/italian visitor as the `` reproductor '' . 
  to be honest they are a stalkish and can be pain in the ass once they estimate one can be a potential new member . 
  it 's difficult to feel sympathy for them . 
  ich habe geld * i have money *, 
  * - what are your strategy , development plan , and perspectives for sustainable growth ? 
  cheap !, 
  10 euro/hour and you are hired ( remember you 'll live in germany and pay german living costs ) . 
   innovative startup capital of berlin !, 
  let 's create a platform allowing to < buy | book  an < article | service  through the internet !, 
  first we need an executive board and attorneys , then let 's hire prashad , ivan , and lukasz for 20 euro/hour . 
  there will be free beer and fruits in the office . 
  dude , as an employed , tax - and contribution - paying person let me assure you all my gains are perfectly distributed away from me . 
  not a checkmate at all . 
  sap is an old corporate hegemon creating `` software '' for other old corporate hegemons . 
  not a recent success story . 
  [ there you go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rocket_internet ) . 
  now your turn . 
  give an example of recent german success story which proves me wrong . 
  i want to be `` researcher '' then ... where 's my money to burn ? 
   you forget that originally all innovative `` premium '' products are expensive before they make it to the lower segment , that 's natural way of spreading the technology . 
  nope . 
  big part of premium `` innovation '' is blind valley to burn the cash of rich consumers and to keep the engineers busy and employed . 
  so ... trickle-down corporate-steered oftentimes publicly subsidized `` innovation '' ? 
  the problem is this kind of innovation goes into premium products ( e.g. 
  premium car brands ) and later is strictly controlled by ip/copyrights . 
  the 10k euro worth headlight of top mercedes is innovative but what 's the fucking point of it ? 
  ... and the cutthroat ip , copyright , and `` privacy '' environment created by massive german industries and lobbies . 
  try to become successful ( or even visible ) and the legal trolls will tear you into pieces . 
  one simply does n't become successful in germany without lawyer parents . 
  the engineering itself can be done by low-paid eastern europeans and imported indians managed by a horde of mba and management graduates . 
   ( and germany does n't make the top 10 ) no surprise , once one have a cosy position in automotive industry why bother with any risks ? 
  you are paying in the welfare-worth of money but in the receiving countries it does n't go on welfare . 
  ps please keep paying . 
  do n't act innocent , we all know luxembourg is a portuguese colony . 
  ... and each of them owns 10 banks , hosts an eu institution in their bedroom , and has an uncle who is high eu official . 
  [ we are europeans !, 
  no we are europeans !, 
  we are europeans even more ! ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bomxmjqx0 ) . 
   destroyed by nazis nazis who ? 
  it must be awkward to speak on the eu forum about cities being levelled to the ground by germans during wwii , somehow he did n't have the problem to say the birth country of the rotterdam 's mayor . 
  beautifully scripted . 
   2500 something attacks on refugee shelters are n't all or most of these attacks conducted on empty shelters with not casualties ? 
  in this case , yes it 's just vandalism and terrible waste of taxpayers ' money . 
  migrants-inhabitants of the shelters are more dangerous themselves as there were multiple cases when they set their own shelters full of people on fire .
