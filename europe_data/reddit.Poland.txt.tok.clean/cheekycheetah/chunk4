  by buying all shares of these companies available on the stock exchange , will i become the owner of them ? 
  dude , in poland we know this at least since the times we had the king from vasa dynasty, 
  - lidl ( ee ) gmbh - aldi ( ee ) gmbh - rossmann ( ee ) gmbh - dm ( ee ) gmbh - obi ( ee ) gmbh - kaufland ( ee ) gmbh hey wait ... these are all from the same country ... and they were saying that `` capital has no nationality '' . 
  good, 
  if we 'll not get their quality stuff , everyone 's getting potato . 
  what 's in the front purse ? 
  no wonder ... how long one can survive on fries with mayo ? 
  this one is equally stupid . 
  bummer , eu is on me, 
  eastern european women are very popular in western european red light districts . 
  very cheap and willing . 
  parents are hurting their daughters very cruelly by feeding them with `` polish ( or any other ee country ) women are the most beautiful in the world '' . 
  all inhabitants commited suicide ? 
  ^ ok , ^ ^ stupid ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  `` jews '' placed greece in western europe - that 's one reason for greeks to dislike them ... 
  greece , iceland , and finland classified under western europe . 
  this is a ranking prepared by a clueless american lobby . 
  what american jews were doing during '30s and '40s ? 
  what a particular tradition . 
  in eastern europe we spray each other with water , but only one day in a year - around easter ~ ~ n ~ ~ . 
  i hope we catch up quickly with this high cultural standards . 
  so ... how far 20 bucks will take me ? 
  edit the downvote wave is crazy , this can not be single redditors downvoting . 
  glitch in the matrix - there are no poles in germany , ask any german person . 
  there are only eastern european thieves , burglars , and beggars , but their presence and opinion do n't matter . 
   merkel signed a deal a couple days ago migrants from tunisia are on german soil for over a year now , oftentimes traveling freely through the entire schengen zone . 
  the tunisian authorities confirmed the identity days after the `` road accident '' . 
  `` almost on time '' is the keyword here . 
  they were about to kick out one tunisian who had managed to make quite a mess before even being identified ... this whole enterprise is starting to cost lives of non-german eu nationals who obviously are not happy about it . 
  manned missions are like taking a raw egg everywhere with you and doing everything to keep it undamaged . 
  [ the photos from the surface ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?tbm=isch&amp;ncr=1&amp;q=%d0%92%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b0-14 ) the probe made . 
  then you must be one of those from german internet bubble with nazi hysteria , because i have n't mentioned the above a single time . 
  request denied , you 'll have to invade . 
   maybe because he 's a pro-european and doing a decent job decent job or obedient job ? 
  when migrant crisis blown up over a year ago his first words were about tackling the root cause ( i.e. 
  human smugglers and related industry ) after which he disappeared from public attention for a good couple of months . 
  the spanking must have hurt . 
  [ your chancellor is actively lobbying for him , even during the recent visit in poland . 
  ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/293978,kaczynski-against-tusk-reelection-as-european-council-president ), 
  so ... if we talk about solving one maybe let 's solve both at one go ? 
  somehow it never works this way, 
  when he became the president of the council and everyone was asking `` who is the person ? '', 
  the answer was `` dunno , but he speaks german and angela likes him '' . 
  he abandoned the position of polish prime minister in a rather hectic , shameful , and opportunistic way . 
  germans - if you like him so much then take and decorate him however you please , just stop trying to install your puppets in poland . 
  this is the topic which should be discussed very seriously . 
  next time i will hear that women are any way opressed in poland i will start hitting people . 
  * i 'm among the 3 % !, 
  in the old rover the airbag fired but completely dislocated rendering it useless, 
  many eu countries ( e.g. 
  v4 ) almost do n't trade with usa at all , while they trade with germany too much . 
  pre-mortal convulsions and screams of a deceasing media form ? 
  the clip was delivered to you thanks to each german household paying 17.5 euro/month . 
   finally , the idea that hitler was something happening because we are germans is off the table ( you do n't want to know how often this stereotyp comes up when you are on the internet ) . 
  now , we have so many nations that proove that there are egomanic nationalist idiots able to get into government , and even stupider ones than hitler was  i think the interest in this is because alot of german 's see unpleasent similarities between trump now and early-stage nazi-germany , stop projecting german problems onto other nations . 
  nazis were germans/austrians and as of today germany is the only country in the world where they gained significant power . 
  stop you smartass self-righteous `` warnings '' about `` this is how is starts '' . 
  even domestically germans are n't able to distinguish primitive hooligans or skinheads from nazis . 
  [ politico ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politico#global_expansion ) in europe is run by the tabloid hegemon . 
  so we have german tabloid media company + american media company = perfect hysteria . 
  luckily they had fucked off from poland some time ago and now they are on trump . 
  occasionally they `` fight '' for `` internet freedom '' whatever that means in their narrative . 
  not for much longer fortunately, 
  there should be a lobby to criminalize eastern european xenophobia in germany . 
  not only they contribute , sponsoring your bloated social systems , but then you call them thieves and burglars . 
  lol, 
  comparing legal intra-eu migrations with recent migrant crisis . 
  where these kind of trolls spring from ? 
  not even a drop trickles down - everything is tightly funneled out through ireland/luxembourg/liechtenstein / netherlands . 
  my experience with german contractors ( it sector ) is `` take any shit we come up with because you do n't have a choice as we are the authorized supplier '' . 
  in some movies there are many peers involved , but it 's purely empirical and i doubt they produce any documentation . 
   people suddenly noticed our wages are way too low this is becoming the czech trademark , appearing even in czech porn when they `` interview '' the `` models '' on camera before `` the action '' ( i 've heard from a friend of course ) . 
  you porn gives an insight into important social and economical issues of the country . 
  ... and something about drinking too much wine during eu summit . 
  czechs are secretly in love with germans and in return germans allowed them to have ( almost ) their own car brand . 
  czechs should start with more days of annual leave . 
  20 days is a fucking misery . 
  why in such case an eu citizen would have to pay medical bill upfront ? 
   but as an eu citizen you have to pay the bill first and then request the refund . 
  the victim was employed in germany by german company . 
  i 'm pretty sure he is talking about tax avoidance at some point . 
   the family from the article got charged because he 's not a german citizen ( no health insurance ) . 
  from the article :  based on a photo provided by her employer , the german logistics company 4flow . 
  [ website of the employer ] ( http://www.4flow.de/en.html ) . 
  we have a case of eu citizens legally working in another eu country - so probably the victim had public health insurance with obligatory monthly contributions . 
  it was n't some `` immigrant '' or `` expat '' but eu citizen - in such cases the person has rights comparable with legitimate citizen . 
  i know german authorities , service and utility providers take a piss on it most of the time , but it 's infuriating . 
   wait , in germany they charge the family for an autopsy ? 
  not that there was any doubt about what caused the deaths . 
  it 's because  it was initially classified as a road incident rather than a terrorist attack hence the meme `` you are more likely to die in a car accident than terrorist attack '' . 
  there are no terrorist attacks and it 's better not to ask questions . 
  also a food for thought for those praising german `` free '' healthcare . 
  norway is giving us celebrity mass killer . 
   germany being like `` i 'm willing '' , and eastern europe going along with it ,  other eu nations will financially die as the the east shifting eu there are so many eu nationals working in germany . 
  i do n't get why they can not do the same job in their home countries with similar salary thus improving their home economies . 
  do we have this eu and single market thing or not ? 
  or it 's there only when it 's profiting for the predators ? 
  yeah sure ... the mere fact that they bully subscribers into payment by direct debit should be sufficient to terminate the contract but somehow it does n't work this way . 
  consent for direct debit is incorporated into service contract . 
  no consent - no contract , no service .
