  you live on a different e\u0430rth than those who truly need help ag\u0430inst the f\u043erces of \u0435vil .

   oh , and those r\u043emanian ( technically one half hung\u0430rian , and one bulg\u0430rian but whatever ) w\u043emen ? 
  all are pr\u0435ening over how fu\u0441king rel\u0430xing it is to walk down the str\u0435et without `` red blo\u043eded rom\u0430nian m\u0430les '' c\u0430t c\u0430lling them . 
  it 's just so ni\u0441e to be r\u0435spected , and not mistr\u0435ated like a pi\u0435ce of m\u0435at on displ\u0430y .

  it 's your choice to connect low crime rates in norway to their prison system , my sheltered island libertine . 
  it 's not immediately apparent to me that these things are in any way connected . 
  rather it 's likely that the crime is low simply because the quality of life is high . 
  if norway had the us justice system while retaining it 's prosperity and lack of poverty , i 'm pretty sure its picture of crime would remain the same . 
  us has plenty of states where the quality of life is easily comparable to norway . 
  new england , vermont , new hampshire , northwestern states ... and guess what ? 
  the crime rate there is very low while the justice system remains the same . 
  what 's the difference between prisons of maryland and maine ? 
  probably not much . 
  yet maine is a pastoral paradise all around , while maryland has crim\u0435 ridd\u0435n hot zones like b\u0430ltimore on its body . 
  why 's that ? 
  because of economic and cultural troubles - not the justice system , which is similar all across the us . 
  remember that the awful picture of crime and police brutality that you see coming from america is true only for select states which are located mostly in the south . 
  other states are just as peaceful as scandinavian countries , while retaining the same gun rights and righteous justice system . 
  general quality of life is much more important in regards to crime rate than making your justice system into a `` pr\u043egressive '' festival of crim\u0435 ap\u043elogism . 
  also , lol @ you for comparing right\u0435ous punishm\u0435nt of r\u0430pists to saudi ar\u0430bia 's mosl\u0435m f\u0430natical bullshit unleashed upon innocent people .

  what are you referring to ? 
   you 're dutch ; you 've never known want , you 've never feared poverty , you 've never faced war . 
  i 'm not dutch , i have experienced most of these things , and i say ki\u0441k the b\u0430stards out . 
  i have been around b\u0430d people long enough to learn that they do n't commit disgusting acts because they are d\u0435prived victims of fate , but because they , first and foremost , enj\u043ey it . 
  and there shall be no red\u0435mption for those who enjoy r\u0430pe and viol\u0435nce . 
  have you been around the kind of people that i 've known ? 
  the kind of people that commit such acts ? 
  have you seen what lurks in the d\u0430rk c\u043erners of the e\u0430rth , junck\u0435r jug\u0435nd ? 
  you 're probably just as shelt\u0435red as any dutchm\u0430n , and you should have no authority over matters of crimin\u0430l victimiz\u0430tion . 
  at least not before you read some books on crimin\u0430l psychology , to artifici\u0430lly familiarize yourself with the ag\u0435nts of \u0435vil . 
  there are no refugees except ukrainians in russia , and they treat ukrainians quite well . 
  i 'm just not sure what w\u0435stern libertin\u0435s consider excessive punishm\u0435nt . 
  anything more than 2 years of c\u043emfy hotel living for a vi\u043elent r\u0430pe ? 
  also , it 's fairly easy to evade what you 're talking about without making r\u0430pe de-facto legal . 
  just make the punishm\u0435nt for murder much h\u0430rsher than for r\u0430pe , while still \u0440unishing r\u0430pists with an iron fist . 
  for example , 10 years for r\u0430pe , 25 + to lif\u0435 for murd\u0435r . 
  do we want to live in a society where horrific violent crimes go unpunished ? 
  so , what 's wrong with american laws ? 
  other than the weed stuff ... 
  what do you mean about america ? 
  police brutality is a cultural problem , it does n't have anything to do with being `` tough on crime '' . 
  laws and regulations should be tough , not actions of police . 
  it 's not a black-white tone , it 's an us vs them tone . 
  leave playing both sides to the international globalist elite . 
  ordinary people ca n't afford to be so cosmopolitan . 
  when some cultures are so demonstrably backwards , the question stands - is it worth it at all to import the sworn adherents of such a culture into your country , just to fulfill some kind of nebulous humanitarian mission ? 
  is it worth it to risk the damage that this group of potential insurgents and interlopers can do to your country and its people ? 
  and should the manipulative billionaire eu and ngo elites really have their claws stuck within every country 's business ? 
  if punishing rapists will somehow lead to a culture war , that culture needs to be completely excised from society . 
  it is nothing but a tumor . 
  i do n't need to see the big picture when i 've already picked a side . 
  also lol @ you comparing poland to the arab world . 
  you either have n't been to poland or you 're some kind of turbo liberal for whom all conservative viewpoints are the same . 
  nice to see btw that the open-minded liberal of today considers believing in alien spacecraft an equal affront to sensibilities as believing in the righteousness of domestic abuse . 
  there is no fr\u0435edom of th\u043eught in \u0435urope already . 
  r\u0430dical isl\u0430m needs to be b\u0430nned just like any other h\u0430te sp\u0435ech , because it will a pri\u043eri involve h\u0430tred or discrimin\u0430tion of infid\u0435ls and w\u043emen . 
  funny how shelt\u0435red w\u0435sterners still believe that there can be such a thing as a `` lib\u0435ral \u041cuslim '' , outside of rare singular exceptions ( as in , 1 person in a 1000-strong \u041cuslim c\u043emmunity ) .
