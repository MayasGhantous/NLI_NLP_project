where ? 
  ca n't see anything of that sort in the article . 
  unless , of course , it has been changed since you posted the link . 
   a nato military officer said the alliance was looking into the reports [ ... ]  `` if this crossing into ukraine is confirmed [ ... ] '' the officer said on condition of anonymity . 
  it 's probably vitali klitschko . 
  `` topol is n't afraid of sanctions '' and `` sanctions ? 
  do n't make my iskanders laugh '' . 
  milonov was also featured in stephen fry 's documentary `` out there '' last year . 
  the relevant bits can be found on youtube . 
  i doubt it . 
  these are air-to-surface missiles and ukrainian air force probably lacks a platform to launch it from . 
  i had one of them in the early 80s . 
  my masculinity was increased by a factor of ten the very moment i started wearing it . 
  dude , what about vostok watches ? 
  national federation of seldomly employed, 
  have you developed any noticeable fascist tendencies since you started ? 
  i see . 
  i hope there was a message to vova as well . ^ ^ j/k, 
  what 's the story with mutti on image no . 
  nope . 
  there are only about 50k servicemen in polish land forces . 
  your number probably includes all branches of military with support , logistics and civilian employees . 
   does your family , by chance , come from east galicia ? 
  nope , kalisz and pozna\u0144 prior to ww2 , moved here in the late 60s when copper industry was being developed . 
  i 'm quite positive i heard the term used in other parts of the country . 
  also , see the relevant part of [ this article ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c5%82%c3%b3j ) . 
  why would they do that ? 
  insurgents can probably gain further territory and negotiate from an even better position once winter comes and ukrainian economy slides deeper into decline . 
  i doubt `` wek/weck '' is limited to regional use . 
  it would be quite strange since the verb `` wekowa\u0107 '' is accepted as standard polish . 
  any video confessions published by kiev junta were filmed after those hapless and confused soldiers had been tricked into drinking maidan tea prepared personally by victoria nuland and under mind control of cia agents . 
   polish taxpayers really want to pay for [ ... ] this strange political publicity stunt it 's a private/corporate initiative of intermarche pr department . 
   explain what you mean by `` right-wing extremists '' [ ... ] people like mikael skillt . 
  so , their commander is n't the leader of [ social-national assembly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social-national_assembly ) and right-wing extremists do n't flock to them ? 
  google `` mustang wanted azov '' and see the results . 
  that 's why i asked the question and wanted slezyr to confirm/deny it . 
  was he really in the azov battalion ? 
  if so , fuck that dude and his poisonous ideology . 
  the videos were first found [ here ] ( http://colonelcassad.livejournal.com/1734246.html ) which is a website well-known for supporting the separatists , and according to the titles some of them were filmed on the road near snizhne . 
  also , the dudes in the videos are allegedly known as active participants in the conflict . 
  other sources ( and the title of the video ) suggest it 's actually a btr-82a , not btr-80a . 
  i 'm definitely not going to smoke what that dude has been smoking . 
  not even once . 
  an artillery strike manages to destroy a part of an armored convoy in the middle of the night ?

  of course not !, 
  why would you deprive your favourite seal of its sight ? 
  even if only temporarily . 
  nonsense . 
  you are strictly forbidden from eating it !, 
  however , it is highly effective when defending one 's favourite baby seal from a surprise attack by a fur trapper . 
  just rub it into his beady little eyes .

  while the cyclist story was a useless submission , vityok has been a redditor for 6.5 years and i do n't remember him being that outspoken and/or obsessed with the subject even a year ago . 
  there are far worse offenders with 4-month-old accounts who relentlessly spam this subreddit , so let 's not single him out . 
  but there is n't much we can do about it unless the modgods decide to banish all news even remotely connected to ukrainian/russian conflict to a dedicated megathread and strictly enforce this new rule . 
  seems like a reasonable `` technical candidate '' for the position . 
  thanks for taking time to reply . 
  do n't know about a black site , but there might be an nsa station in the holy see . 
  i see . 
  a follow up : he seems to be not affiliated to any of the current political parties : do you know anything about his views , and how is he perceived by ukrainians ?
