  why 's that ? 
  they are an aggressive bunch and the tales of ` defending the honour of a helpless polish girl ' are as believable as initially circulated rumours of one of the hooligans getting stabbed in the chest by one of the mexican sailors before the start of the brawl . 
  he used to be sort of popular north of your country in the 70s as well . 
  btw , how 's helena vondrackova doing these days ? 
  the place looks like a good setting for a post-apocalyptic movie . 
  honestly , read the thread again . 
  this is unbelievable . 
  in your case , it 's like talking to a someone who ca n't trace his/her steps . 
   although i 'm not really sure why are you so upset ? 
  [ ... ] ad-hominem attacks [ ... ] seriously ? 
  i was n't even upset . 
  please read again through the thread and you 'll probably notice when you overreacted . 
  the `` sinok '' ( ca n't be bothered to copy/paste cyrillic ) was a nice touch though . 
  good night to you , it must be quite late in your timezone . 
  brainwashed nobody ? 
  misguided nationalist like you really know how to make an impression on people who are sympathetic to your country and admire your culture . 
  i 'm glad russians i 've met were n't like you . 
  seriously , go see a therapist , son . 
   sure , relocating was never as easy as now when you can just move without notifying or asking anyone [ ... ] so , in a nuthsell , there was no freedom of movement . 
  just a few words in response to your peculiar outburst : please , do n't try to glorify ussr . 
  it 's pointless and simply preposterous . 
  on a side note , both my parents visited your glorious ussr ( from leningrad , through samarkand to lake baikal ) and they were n't smitten by the standard of living . 
  on the contrary , outside of metropolitan areas people were begging them for a piece of bread . 
   [ ... ] had no internal borders so people could mix together freely [ ... ] not true . 
  movement within ussr was restricted - you needed a permit / internal passport to move to a different part of ussr . 
  you are confusing the country of russia with kremlin ( which is a shorthand for russian government in this case , not the building complex ) . 
  although it must be noted that bentley is owned by volkswagen , and jaguar / land rover by tata . 
  we should act now . 
  once they develop the muslamic ray gun ^ tm technology it 'll be too late . 
  europe will fall and all we 'll have is halal meals in canteens . 
  he does n't drink alcohol either . 
  is sharia creeping into russia ? 
  look through his comment history . 
  jack kevorkian was also of armenian descent . 
  i believe they are quite respected among users of their equipment : firemen , miners , doctors , soldiers , etc. 
   yeah , that 's it : / no , it 's not . 
  one word for you : dr\u00e4ger . 
  do n't know why , but whenever someone says `` marzipan '' i think l\u00fcbecker marzipan . 
  and i 'm not even into sweets . 
  [ yom hashoah ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8m_omujcp8 ), 
   i do n't even care about zus - nobody in my generation believes it will be around when we will retire . 
  yet we are still paying . 
   [ ... ] japan [ ... ] the only solution short of massive immigration is working until you die . 
   by nothing i mean nothing important with very small exceptions . 
  poland needs huge reforms now - mainly to deal with ticking demography bomb . 
  exactly . 
  raising the retirement age is simply not enough - it only postpones the inevitable bankruptcy of zus . 
  [ scorchio !,

  whoa , dude . 
  that sydney video seems a bit shaky . 
  i 'll give it a try though when at  [ 0 ] . 
  what a relaxing video !, 
  really , that 's some mellow footage . 
  yep , that 's the one . 
  very impressive structure . 
   and this is how you cross the border between sweden and denmark !, 
  is that the bridge from bron | broen ?

  but seriously , what a pathetic man !, 
  did n't he shave it off altogether some months ago ? 
  i believe i heard such arguments when penalties for drug possession were first being introduced some 13-15 years ago down in my neck of the woods . 
  i might be remembering incorrectly though . 
  article 14 includes provisions on `` demand reduction '' - a possible interpretation is a ban on promotion of drug consumption . 
  might be wrong , inal . 
  [ un convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_against_illicit_traffic_in_narcotic_drugs_and_psychotropic_substances ), 
  within legal framework . 
  polish participation in the occupation of iraq and the alleged involvement in extraordinary renditions come to mind when thinking about recent history . 
  it 's actually funny that `` a document sleeve '' can be funny just a few kilometers across the border . 
  europe is fun . 
  sure . 
  i 'm only talking about 3 million dead jews whose property suddenly disappeared . 
  there are considerable differences in case of karelia and poland : the modern state of poland is an extension of [ prl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_republic_of_poland ) , and just because of that we have a moral obligation to return the stolen property . 
  i was only pointing out how much harder it is to prove ownership rights in courts . 
  even if it 's a complicated process , it should be dealt with . 
  also , it 's funny how much easier it went with the abomination called komisje maj\u0105tkowe . 
  agreed , that 's taking it too far . 
  on the other hand i strongly believe in restituting property to individuals who are descendants , or even remotely related to the original owners . 
  it 's an official flag of lower silesia voivoidship . 
  i have n't seen a single person waving one in real life yet . 
  take it up with israelis , i guess . 
  well , we gave a lot of property back to catholic church , why should n't we do the same for jews ? 
  you know it 's a piast eagle in my flair , not some german crest , right ? 
  how 's restitution of jewish property going along in our country ? 
  stop being aggressive , please . 
  i 'm not talking about germans . 
  sooner or later it shall be given back to the descendants of the original owners , i hope . 
  it 's a right thing to do , is n't it ? 
  but you might in fact live in a house built on unrestituted property stolen in the aftermath of ww2 . 
   winged hussars are amazing , and i want their armour pretty badly . 
  [ we lost pole position to lithuania last year . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-236_en.htm ), 
  happens to the best of us . 
  and the front registration plate of the vehicle does n't even look polish - the one on the photo has got blue borders on both sides ( albania ? ), 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  there are more secure facilities on us soil . 
   he said russia might need to respond by limiting imports of georgian wine . 
  is it what it 's really about ? 
  imports of georgian wine have just been resumed iirc . 
  agreed .
