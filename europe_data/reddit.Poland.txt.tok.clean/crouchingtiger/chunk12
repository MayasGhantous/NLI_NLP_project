  you seem like a level-headed person . 
  probably a bit too uncompromising but it does n't matter much . 
  i guess you simply do n't care , but your opinions would be better heard if you voiced them without referring to the currently adored `` saviour of free speech / fearless fighter for transparency / defender of truth '' in less inflammatory terms ( i.e. 
  scum - even if he is one ) ? 
  i sincerely believe folks here , at least some of them , would benefit from your reasonable arguments if only you made an effort . 
  grumble grumble . 
  and it 's back to business . 
  even if every major political entity in france voiced anger at us surveillance of european institutions ( and rightly so , even if somehow hypocritically ) , only far-right , the greens ( members of the coalition ) and some minor left-wing parties support giving him asylum . 
  a peculiar bunch if you ask me . 
  no word from hollande so far iirc . 
  polish politicians are almost unanimously pro-american . 
  i think they all agree on this issue , i.e. 
  giving snowden asylum would be a mistake . 
   closer ties with germany . 
  [ foreign minister guido westerwelle confirmed germany had received an asylum request and said it would review it `` according to the law '' , though he `` could not imagine '' that the request would be approved . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/national/20130702-50633.html )  closer ties with france . 
  it 's unlikely france will grant him asylum . 
  is n't it mostly political fringe who call for giving him refuge ? 
   even internally - po could score few points across the board for next election . 
  i would n't be so sure about it . 
  probably only among some very specific demographics of voters . 
  as to sticking it to us : i ca n't really see the point . 
  we 'll have more long-term gains from friendly cooperation with them , being nato members , etc. 
  no , they clearly stated now it was n't in polish national interest . 
  all sentiments aside , i have to agree with that . 
  also , an application faxed by someone claiming to be snowden does n't fulfill the criteria for granting asylum , really . 
   poland hosted a black site cia torture prison - going there would be a huge mistake . 
  but stare klejkuty is beautiful this time of the year !, 
  on a more serious note : ministry of foreign affairs has refused his application on technicality . 
  even if , it would never have received positive recommendation from the minister , radek sikorski ( his words ) . 
  according to a [ wikileaks press release ] ( http://wikileaks.org/edward-snowden-submits-asylum.html ) he 's submitted asylum requests to 21 countries . 
  i was shocked to find one of them is the republic of poland . 
  has he lost touch with reality or does he want to find himself in a cozy little room in stare klejkuty ? 
  obviously . 
  and not only in india , the symbol used to be rather popular worldwide prior to the rise of nazism . 
  there 's even a town in canada called swastika . 
  however , all things considered , i think it 's rather far-detached from its original meaning when spray-painted on the wall by a brainless skinhead . 
  let 's put miniature surveillance devices in every choco treasure egg ( kinder surprise for us market ) . 
  poland : * the results of local council and mayoral by-elections in elbl\u0105g were announced . 
  opposition from law & justice won 10 seats in the council , while the ruling party civic platform took 7 , and democratic left alliance took 5 seats . 
  next round of mayoral elections will take place in a few weeks between an l&j candidate and a cp candidate . 
  * on tuesday , some hoaxter ( s ) sent a number of emails containing bomb threats to various institutions and hospitals which resulted in evacuation of 2500 people . 
  [ an alleged perpetrator has been apprehended ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/139879,man-arrested-on-bomb-hoax-charges ) . 
  * [ a prosecutor in bia\u0142ystok declared swastikas `` symbols of happiness . 
  '' ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/139640,swastika-%e2%80%93-symbol-of-happiness ) * both main parties organized party conferences in the same region ( silesia ) . 
  boring political speeches , empty rhetoric , etc. 
  ( subjective impression ) . 
  the source 's website certainly seems odd . 
  sample article titles ( subscription only , of course ) : * world war z and its discomforting subliminal messages ( world war z has more to do with zionism than zombies ) * phil marshall 's killers linked to 9/11 , pinal air park , and iran-contra, 
  absolutely . 
  pakistan is a quagmire . 
  the situation is rather complex . 
  it 's not for everyone . 
  i think we belong to different age-groups . 
  yet , saying 50pln is a meal for two is a gross oversimplification . 
  shit 's expensive when considering low wages . 
  let 's complain about that , 
  wine included ? 
  pricing might be a bit off down here ( a small , sort of provincial town ) , but a salad with marinated salmon is +30 pln , a small steak is easily 80pln , etc. 
  no , it 's not . 
  although it depends on your definition of a good meal . 
  a supper for two is upwards of 100 if you want decent ingredients and good service . 
  i believe pakistani government does n't look kindly on foreign operatives working within their territory . 
  as sad as it is , the only hope is either mediation or pakistani rangers . 
  it costs approx . 
  10eur ( 40-50pln ) per 250 ml for the good stuff in poland . 
  how much is it in denmark ? 
  funny how i got `` nebi ljubila '' misheard with `` jebi '' ( yes , i 'm lame - that was my attempt at humour ) . 
  but i get the negative connotation of all things turkish in the balkans . 
  and of course : thank you . 
  i absolutely do n't consider them tainted . 
  the fact that wagner was antisemitic ( etc. ), 
  does n't make me enjoy his music any less . 
  thank you for lux aeterna - i think i have n't listened to it for a nice few years . 
  but if we are exchanging heavy stuff , let me send back [ this little joyful song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp3blfzwjna ) composed by a compatriot of mine . 
  at about 20s in . 
  i have fun sometimes listening to songs in other slavic languages and interpreting them in absurd ways . 
  never mind . 
  edit : a non-slavic example of the game would be [ this at 44s ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=rkmqsqhevpm#t=44s ) - it really sounds like `` dziwek du\u017co '' ( a lot of whores ), 
  wait , are they actually singing `` jebij [ incomprehensible ] turcina ? '', 
  brilliant music . 
  funnily enough both composers were admired by * that * austrian guy . 
  here 's [ the trailer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc63id-_z3m ) . 
  you can find the whole thing on tpb , or even better buy the dvd ( it 's only 20pln or so ) . 
  i 'm sorry , you are so wrong . 
  have you seen [ rose ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2043979/ ) ? 
  one of the most brilliant war-related movies ever made in poland . 
  brutal , depressing yet at the same time beautiful . 
  it 's just a guess but op is probably complaining about one-sided portrayal of poles in the miniseries while forgetting those were secondary characters and not all of them were cast in a negative light . 
  seriously , bregovic was very popular ( just about everyone over 35 knows songs like kalashnikov , etc ) . 
  i do n't want to sound pretentious but your traditional folk music ( not folk-pop crossover ) is delightful . 
  big kudos . 
  different strokes for different folks . 
  it 's all a matter of taste . 
  local , traditional culture deserves preserving for future generations . 
  personally , i 'd rather listen to bosanski zubor than some overproduced rai-influenced crap like azis which is apparently passing for balkan music nowadays . 
  i 'll definitely research `` sevdalinka '' tomorrow . 
  thank you . 
  1 , 2 & 4 - not my cup of tea , really .
