  ) , on the other hand , is quite good . 
  thank you . 
  goran bregovic used to be quite popular in poland 10-15 years ago . 
  i believe he even recorded an album with some sort of a ` pop star ' here ( his kusturica soundtracks used to be popular as well ) . 
  good stuff . 
  but the song by bosanski zubar you linked - ` svani zoro ' - is simply insane . 
  thank you so much !, 
  brilliant !, 
  thank you for clearing that up . 
  would you be able to suggest any other traditional bosnian stuff with the same level of rawness and energy ? 
  that would be interesting . 
  i hear some strong slavonic influences in the song i linked . 
  romani music is rather different down where i live . 
  [ it sounds more or less like that ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9jonhri57a ) . 
  i think it 's bosnian . 
  but i might be wrong . 
  someone local should confirm . 
  edit : might actually be croatian ? 
   the balkan is strong with this one . 
  maybe . 
  for an outsider like me [ this is strong balkan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h1xyq33yo0 ) . 
  makes my head spin and i love it . 
  sorry , ca n't help you there . 
  if i find one , i 'll let you know . 
  sorry if i came off as a bit of a dick . 
  also , i would n't take anything written in the linked newspaper as gospel - they are quite famous for their shady journalistic practices . 
  btw , a televised discussion is supposed to take place tomorrow after the last part of the miniseries . 
  participants will include journalists and historians from both countries ( among them julius h. schoeps ) . 
  should be an interesting watch . 
  what is the point of submitting a link to a cursory press review linked to an article behind a paywall ? 
  as if there was n't enough garbage content on reddit as it is . 
  i might be a bit left-of-centre yet i completely agree - dziennik gazeta prawna is hands down the best , serious polish newspaper . 
  let me guess , the bus was also full of clangers ? 
  not really . 
  the onion is satirical , fakt is a daily tabloid owned by axel springer polska . 
  looks like a rather complex game indeed . 
  that would be hilarious . 
  what 's hoi ?

  [ probably equipment for their at unit ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/2111117/pope-benedict-xvi-sets-up-anti-terrorist-squad.html ), 
  agreed on the latter . 
  these kids are simply amazing . 
  sure . 
  we might have different perspectives . 
  personally i simply feel for them being old enough to have participated in a number of pro-democracy demonstrations in the 80s . 
  also , our freedom is n't set in stone , it 's a process . 
  if you have a quarter of an hour or so to spare i humbly suggest you watch [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0uwh971f6w ) . 
  these young people put so-called europeans to shame with their zeal for freedom . 
  still , it 's a nice find . 
  thanks for posting !, 
  i think your interpretation is wrong : hourly wage of a ceo in romania is $ 305 which takes a lowest wage-earner approx . 
  29 days to earn , while median wage-earner has to toil away for 12.5 days . 
  it 's a valid point , i guess . 
  [ here 's some infographics you might be interested in ] ( http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/infographic-msas-may-2013/ ) . 
  looks better than i expected . 
  gay people are n't infertile , and cross-border adoption is always an option . 
  unless of course you meant something different from population growth by `` maintaining a healthy population . '', 
  it 's getting better in some parts of major metropolitan areas . 
  still , there 's not much chance of getting a non-humiliating civil union bill passed through the current conservative parliament . 
  what 's proposed now is some sad compromise light years away from equality . 
  in a nutshell - there 's no chance of true marriage equality in the near future . 
  i love this idea . 
  let 's call it gaysrael !, 
  or something even more fabulous . 
  the problem is , as i see it , that progress in lgbt rights has somehow bypassed poland while the rest of european countries have made a tremendous step towards equality within the past 10 years or so . 
   neither they fit in europe mentally ( ... ) the pot calling the kettle back ? 
  poland is far from the shining beacon of tolerance in this regard . 
  did anyone say [ falco ] ( http://www.youtube.com/artist/falco ) ?

  did you read the article ? 
   the euro hawk is a version of the american global hawk produced by northrop grumman [ ... ] and  germany is in talks with israel on buying heron tp drones [ ... ], 
  brilliant !, 
  could you fix the name of the region in my flag , please ? 
  it 's `` lower silesia '' not `` lower silezia '' . 
  thank you !, 
  to conduct unethical experiments frequently resulting in death . 
  he was on 8 out of 10 cats a few times as well . 
  absolutely . 
  let 's not mock him then . 
  i do n't think we can blame it on google translate in this case . 
  as far as i know edrt _ studies polish . 
  well , he claims he does . 
  so , let 's give him the benefit of the doubt and be helpful . 
  that 's insane . 
  are there no licensing options ? 
  ca n't you pay for radio only , assuming you have one in your kitchen/car ? 
  you have n't seen best korean until you 've seen what passes for tv programming east of your country . 
  seriously , even though i pay only a quarter of what you do , i still think i 'm not getting my money 's worth . 
  in fact , it 's so abysmal i have n't switched the telly on for about 2-3 weeks now . 
  tv licence is eur200 in germany ? 
  it 's not restricted - unfortunately subtitles are in german only ( i think ) . 
   about the rest of the series and accusations , i have no idea , i did n't watch it . 
  did anybody ? 
  is it good ? 
  it 's quite watchable , nothing * that * special though . 
  you can grab it at tpb in 720p and decide for yourself as long as you have 4.5 hours to spare . 
  `` ju\u017c masz pracy '' does n't make any sense . 
  what did you want to say ? 
  anyway , you get points for trying , edert _ .
