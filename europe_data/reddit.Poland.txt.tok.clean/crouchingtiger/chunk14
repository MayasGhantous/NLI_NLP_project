  [ you might like this link as well ] ( http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=44613&amp;cr=children&amp;cr1=#.uww3vjbeuxc ), 
  you are right . 
  i should have indicated the lack of interest in continuing the conversation in a different way . 
  edit : if anyone wonders what happend there - bezbojnicul asked me to remove the last part of my comment where i bade adieu to nashman in vulgar manner . 
  hatred , religious intolerance , sometimes combined with fiscal interests . 
  you are just proving my point with the above . 
  you seriously do n't understand why expulsions of jews happened . 
  may i direct you to / r/conspiratard istead of answering the question ( life 's too short ) . 
  also , i did n't downvote you . 
   why the jews were kicked out of pretty much any country they 've ever been in ... maybe it 's not those countries fault , you know ? 
  you are quite ignorant of history , are n't you ? 
  but that 's to be expected from [ a racist troll ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1aby6q/zimbabwean_police_are_interrogating_young/c8w7jb4 ) frequenting / r/conspiracy and / r/niggers . 
  edit : the racist statement seems to be removed from the conversation but is still available in his comment history . 
  it 's from les mis . 
  the scene in the workshop : javert looking from the office window at valjean right before fantine gets fired . 
  well , he might have been overindulging due to obvious impracticality of owning a black car in sa . 
  even black taxis are usually white down there ( and they are a [ completely different thing ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatfeedback/4187054/surviving-south-africas-black-taxis.html ) ) . 
   geez , what 's wrong with weed ? 
  [ ... ] my friend injected weed once and became instantly addicted !, 
  within weeks he lost his job , sacrificed his parrot to satan and has been , since then , reduced to * orally servicing * belarusian drivers at the truck stop . 
  true story . 
  i 'm sorry , i hate myself for doing it but the result for baltics was inflated - [ it was given as the sum of individual yields ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=potato+yield+estonia+vs+latvia+vs+lithuania+vs+russia ) , and that ca n't be correct . 
  had i known anything about potatoes i 'd have noticed it right away ... 
  [ apparently you 've had them beaten for a while now ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=potato+yield+russia+vs+baltics ), 
  dude , pass that spliff !, 
  so did i. 
  certainly tasted better than most products rationed in the shops in the early 80s . 
  i feel you , man . 
  the packages ( some cheese - usually cheap , brightly orange stuff - and some tinned foods ) were a godsend back then . 
  did you get those handed by rcc as well ? 
  overall , yes . 
  however majority of victims within the territory of romania were massacred by romanian and german killing squads . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.romanianjewish.org/en/in_romania.html ), 
  [ link for non-uk residents ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4cspqrxpao ), 
  the accent definitely gives it some unmistakable charm . 
  [ also , vocabulary is pretty funny on its own if you think of it ] ( http://nonsensopedia.wikia.com/wiki/s%c5%82ownik:polsko-czechos%c5%82owacki ) ( yeah , it 's a joke , i know ) . 
   on the other hand , i heard that czech sounds like that to poles ( maybe slovak too ) . 
  czech sounds adorably infantile to most poles - personally i ca n't help but smile when listening to it , it 's some sort of real-life krtek language . 
  slovak sounds * almost normal * compared to it . 
  you would n't see it if it did n't download . 
  sorry for being pedantic . 
  would it harm anyone to participate in further discussion on those issues ( that 's what the vote was about ) instead of presenting us with that childish display of derision , criticism and ultimately refusal ? 
  it 's a shame then that our conservative mps are n't as empathic as you are . 
  an honest question to a polish conservative : how does your ilk justify denying the right to visit a hospitalized partner or organize a burial after his/her death ? 
   nobody can be decent without supporting a social change ( ... ) that 's not what i said . 
  or maybe , just maybe , he managed to preserve a few shreds of human decency . 
  yes , our conservatism smells of incense and bigotry . 
  sorry , it 's hard not to be disappointed when the government 's ** plenipotentiary for equality ** ( el\u017cbieta radziszewska ) votes for rejection of civil unions . 
  so does great britain . 
  [ yet cameron supports gay ** marriage ** because of the conservative values he believes in ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2mgnfykiy7a ), 
  why ? 
  it all comes down to bigoted teachings of catholic church . 
  it 's a sad state of affairs when mps quote , word for word in some cases , the contents of catechism during the parliamentary discussion on civil unions . 
  honestly , bugger them all . 
  we 've even had a [ permanent moon colony since the 16th century ffs !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_twardowski#legend ), 
  why not give flowers instead ? 
  i 'm almost sure he 'd appreciate it just the same . 
  aliens ? 
  illuminati ? 
  [ just to confuse them a bit further ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o18kwrheh9y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=35s ), 
   north korean leader ( ... ) looks like a big baby who would n't survive a bitch slap from merkel . 
  have you been banned from / r/pyongyang yet ? 
  [ relevant qi clip ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljxhhp-atoc ), 
  the following year his companion of 12 years , alik , passed away as well which alienated him even further . 
  agreed . 
  hints :  jarek , you so silly  kaczynski , you so silly, 
  hard to tell the rationale behind some of his statements besides obvious appeal to his hard-core , nationalist base . 
  also , it 's not the first time he exhibited anti-german or anti-minority sentiments - i believe he called silesians `` a camouflaged german 5th column '' last year . 
  those views are n't shared by majority of poles . 
  mr kaczynski , as you may or may not know , is the leader of an opposition party and holds rather bigoted , xenophobic views on a number of issues . 
  in a nutshell : he 's a cynical , populist cunt . 
  expansion of production happened in the late '60s , early '70s . 
  first mines were operational before the territories were even polish . 
  [ kghm ] ( http://www.kghm.pl/ ) is the largest employer in the region ( so-called copper valley - legnica , lubin , polkowice , g\u0142og\u00f3w ) , hq of the company as well as mining and some ore enrichment facilities are located in the town , smelting is performed in the nearby counties . 
  wages at kghm are above average , they are quite generous with bonuses as well . 
  cigarette smoke contains mao inhibitors as well , and if i am not mistaken those are also a factor in tobacco addiction . 
  anyway , on the subject of switching : i guess it depends on the person . 
  personally , i did n't find it hard at all and i had been a pad smoker for over 20 years . 
  probably a good solution for someone who ca n't cope without nicotine on a longer commute . 
  exactly . 
  and if everyone followed the rule , public bans would n't be necessary . 
  there 's an art to it but a carriage or a bus is n't a right place for it , i guess . 
  while vapour is surely preferable to cigarette smoke , there are still some limits and [ cloudchasing ] ( https://youtu.be/49zpri4inpa?t=63 ) on public transport definitely crosses the line . 
  it 's the very definition of douchebaggery . 
  refraining from vaping on public transport is just good manners . 
  while a bit of stealth vaping on a platform might be excused in some circumstances ( e.g. 
  during off-peak hours and at some distance from other passengers ) , chucking tits into someone 's face is simply rude and should be punishable by mod confiscation . 
  there 's no other explanation as it 's actually impossible to be that stupid . 
  still , the one about `` pounds '' was simply hilarious . 
  this kid should have her own show . 
  she 's even funnier than the girl who made the unforgettable `` trying beer in belgium '' video . 
  these prices are wrong ( at least for poland ) . 
  i have n't smoked for over a year myself , but iirc the prices were higher last time i purchased a pack . 
  unless , of course , the definition of premium cigarettes includes low-price brands . 
  edit : oops , i 'm an idiot and the prices are given in some heathen and obscure currency , not glorious euro . 
  it 's a screenshot from wikipedia . 
  see [ here ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:map_of_the_european_migrant_crisis_2015.png ) . 
  links to real data from eurostat are at the bottom . 
  probably .
