  then again i 'm not sure if the police are even allowed to act at their own discretion in such situations instead of giving chase . 
  nope . 
  i believe he failed to pull over at a random checkpoint or some such . 
  still , he 'd steal your heart ( and soul ) with just one look . 
  [ a very sexy look . 
  sure , brussels could try to pressure the cypriot government to cancel the lease . 
  good luck with that since cyprus has very close ties to russia . 
  also , the situation between eu and russia would have to really deteriorate drastically first . 
  still good for refueling , repairs , and other basic stuff which is what the syrian one is supposed to be used for . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , russia signed a deal with cyprus to use their ports which gives them an alternative to tartus . 
  unless , of course , it has been scrapped since i heard about it back in february ( i do n't keep close tabs on the issue ) . 
  since they are not widely available abroad , your best chance might be a shop like http://www.ebrowarium.pl/, 
  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than polish sites . 
  and having just checked a couple of threads on immigration there , i am afraid i now have cancer . 
   co2 seems most likely . 
  agreed . 
  oh , absolutely . 
  that 's what i meant by my initial question . 
  we can probably exclude co poisoning as the cause of death unless it was intentionally connected to the container . 
  you are thinking of co. . co2 can be safe in higher concentrations ( edit : what i meant is higher than 1 % ) . 
  is n't it more likely they suffocated due to oxygen-deficient atmosphere in an air-tight container rather than co poisoning ? 
  where would co come from in your scenario ? 
  we certainly should , however one can not reason with [ this lot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqnkgqc6uxe ) . 
  wait , is that a prisoner cell block h reference ? 
  is that a heart attack on a stick ? 
  baltic porters are bottom-fermented ( i.e. 
  basically lagers ) , while the british ones are top-fermented . 
  both can be quite delicious . 
  as much as i 'd like to participate , i 'll have to graciously decline your invitation . 
  i have n't watched a single episode of r&m . you take it from here , / u/theworldcrimeleague !, 
  time to make it rain !, 
  * throws money in the air *, 
  it 's just an accident . 
  nothing to see here . 
  why ? 
  the pilot safely ejected and the jet seems to have crashed onto unbuilt land . 
  i do n't doubt there might be some noble smugglers ( i watched an interview with one such individual not long ago ) , however vietnamese people are often trafficked to uk and forced to work in various illegal enterprises . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/26/us-britain-slavery-cannabis-iduskbn0lu00p20150226 ) . 
  sorry , i do n't think we should take such matters lightly . 
  human smugglers are in most cases vile and depraved people who profit from misery of others . 
  it was all over news here as well . 
  btw , since his passengers were vietnamese , i would n't be surprised if he had transported them all the way from poland . 
  strange , the vehicle was hungarian-registered . 
  or do you mean the one who was caught in calais with 18 migrants ? 
  edit : it was on m1 in uk , see http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11792796/polish-lorry-driver-arrested-as-18-illegal-immigrants-found-in-back-of-hgv-on-m1.html, 
  to expand on the catalogue of possible mistakes and errors : you are n't talking about [ shakin ' dudi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io4oyvewc8o ) either . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.demotix.com/news/8235964/artist-g-nther-schaefer-restores-east-side-gallery-painting#media-8235720 ) . 
  it seems some idiot scribbled `` free palestine '' ( twice ) and `` juden '' with a permanent marker . 
  even the artist who painted the mural mentioned it was quite mild that time around ( it was defaced with swastikas and hamas graffiti in the past ) . 
  liar . 
  no , we 're not . 
  having your photo taken with a polar bear is [ perfectly normal in some places ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=bia%c5%82y+mi%c5%9b+zakopane&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cagq_auoamovchmiiohlspdoxgivo8bych3zmgua&amp;biw=1745&amp;bih=878#imgrc=9ldnmirgeckmym%3a ) . 
  there was a discussion about it last year when it hit the news . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2huaho/german_company_is_top_tax_evader_in_greece_will/ ) . 
  also , why are you linking to that steaming pile of shite known as globalresearch ? 
  the religious right who are currently favoured by the polls . 
  thanks , buddy !, 
  and do n't worry , our next government will be full of creationists and climate change deniers , so we 'll have plenty of opportunities to discuss them . 
  too young to remember [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maciej_giertych ) ? 
  also , olive pits in place of eurocents . 
  let 's smash some plates !, 
  probably the only mep with an aussie accent ? 
   [ ... ] aimed at moscow , a city of 12 millions [ ... ] would n't that be the long-range version of jassm ? 
  iirc both finland and poland are supposed to operate the short-range missiles which - unless they somehow manage to penetrate most of the distance in hostile airspace - can never threaten your capital ? 
  probably none . 
  if there were any , we would have heard about it already from the regular sources . 
  then again , there are some 154995 deaths worldwide daily according to wolfram , and i 'm almost postivie some of them occurred in this particular conflict zone due to causes other than natural , e.g. 
  things are slightly better nowadays and most reasonable people see those events as an example of ethnic cleansing . 
  there 's even a memorial to the victims of expulsion in my small lower silesian hometown which would have been unimaginable 30 years ago . 
  best song of the night . 
  she 's planned to perform a dance routine in a full-body exoskeleton complete with hussar wings in the finals . 
  or so i heard . 
  i thought [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwvazmc5efe ) was considered the most australian song ever ? 
  dude , if you do n't correct herr boll 's surname right away , he 'll find you and punch your balls . 
  i 'm not sure they even have * a leader * . 
  also , you might be confusing razem with zmiana ? 
   that mechanized anarcho syndicate has got meme potential . 
  it 's probably just timmy . 
  i nearly cancelled my trip next month out of fear of being culled !, 
  * heaves a sigh of relief *, 
  come on , do n't be that harsh on yourself . 
  germans are far from boring . 
  perhaps a tad obsessed with w\u00f6rk , but neither uninteresting , nor humourless . 
   [ ... ] every bore that gets shot in those regions [ ... ] sweet jesus on a stick !, 
  you shoot people just because they are dull ? 
  look at his repugnant post history . 
  quite ignorant , even for an 11 year old . 
  crush your enemies . 
  see them driven before you . 
  hear the lamentations of their women !, 
   this would prevent drunk starting but not necessarily drunk driving . 
  iids can be programmed to require additional breath samples later . 
   and what about people with asthma/copd ? 
  [ ... ] breath sample volume can be lowered if necessary , however modern devices only require approx . 
  1l of exhaled air ( delivered in a particular pattern ) . 
   also , how does it know the driver is the one breathing into it ? 
  by coupling it with a camera . 
   today they arrive in wroc\u0142aw [ ... ] [ redacted ], 
  i believe dfractalh used `` join or die '' as a call for unity when faced with external danger . 
  see [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/join,_or_die ) .
