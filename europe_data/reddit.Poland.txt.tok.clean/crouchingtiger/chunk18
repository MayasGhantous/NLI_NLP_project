  shush . 
  you are interrupting our two minutes of hate . 
  it 's today . 
  there 's no point . 
  it 's already yesterday here . 
  i do n't know . 
  i was never in mexico during european midnight . 
  fucking plumbing , how does it work ? 
  it 's the same here . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  what happens at midnight ? 
  [ but ... 
  how ?

  four hours have passed since it was morning . 
  what time of day is it now ? 
  please see [ this conversation ] ( http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=64462 ) , for example . 
   deportation <  extermination . 
  also it 's quite clear he talks about plans and stages of plans . 
  that was in response to your claim that there was no evidence einsatzgruppen had had extermination of jews as their aim - `` das endziel '' had been their ultimate goal from the very beginning . 
   steinmeier never said they started planning holocaust in babyn jar . 
  let 's look at the statement quoted above `` here , in babyn yar , the holocaust the campaign to exterminate the jews of europe had its terrible beginnings '' . 
  it seems wrong because the death machine had been in motion for two years already in 1941 . 
   there 's no evidence that actions of einsatzgruppen before 1941 a ) had extermination of jews as their aim [ ... ] if i am not mistaken heydrich mentioned `` das endziel '' in his instructions to einsatzgruppen back in september 1939 . 
   but as far as the systematic annihilation [ ... ] we consider the invasion of the ussr as the starting point . 
  who are `` we '' in the above sentence ? 
  i am really curious . 
   einsatzgruppen only really got going after the invasion . 
  the scale of killing increased significantly , i agree . 
   the wannsee conference marks the transition from one method of killing [ ... ] no argument here . 
  so , according to your logic tens of thousands of victims in cities and shtetlach in poland were n't murdered in the holocaust ? 
  also : babi jar - 1941 , wannsee conference - 1942 . 
  einsatzgruppen executed thousands of jews , roma and other undesirables in 1939 .

  no , it 's not correct . 
  in some countries ( e.g. 
  belgium ) euthanasia is available to people suffering from chronic depression and terminally ill children . 
  i know . 
  i watch you while you sleep ... 
  check his post history . 
  he claims to belong to [ the podlaskie branch of razem ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polska/comments/52psqb/on_way_to_reconciliation_ukraine_poland_to/d7mlbkx ) , in fact he mentions razem a fair bit between his anti-german and anit-western outbursts . 
  i would strongly suggest you have a word with him and ask him to be less obnoxious and/or refrain from advertising his party membership . 
  people like him hurt your image . 
  ... or the big bad [ volk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bbqvmil.png ) !, 
  i 've just skimmed through the exchange and all i can say is that i would n't touch it with a barge pole . 
  the part where the same person replies 3 times within the span of a few minutes more than suggests you are dealing with someone unhinged . 
  dude ... sarcasm is too difficult to convey without an / s. 
  i guess i 'm crap at it , too . 
  the official had no reason to lie or distort the truth . 
  absolutely none at all . 
  a club official claimed legia supporters had chanted `` borussia , nutte , nutte '' . 
  i shit you not . 
  it was all a giant misunderstanding . 
  ... and fenriz is n't completely unattractive either .

  i 'd assume that positive discrimination on the basis of race , religion , or sexual orientation is incompatible with eu non-discrimation laws . 
  they should offer a symbolic discount to untermenschen and other undesirables as an ultimate fuck-you to the nazis . 
  booker has rather [ unorthodox views on a number of issues ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/christopher_booker ) . 
   they ran out of options back home not exactly . 
  the article does n't explain it but the only remaining option was enucleation . 
  the parents , obviously , want to avoid it . 
  it works better if your read it in hans beinholtz 's voice . 
  the last two verses sound suspiciously homoerotic . 
  it 's irn-bru in plastic cups , if i had to guess . 
  very poor form !, 
  as if he were n't even trying . 
  your ignorance is astounding . 
  carry on . 
  no , they were n't . 
  the word `` soviet '' has a specific meaning . 
   one of the worst thing soviets made us do . 
  they did n't have to make `` us '' do anything . 
  polish leadership was onboard with the decision to invade , they were ( allegedly ) even insisting on it . 
  a lot of it , probably . 
  is it entitled `` weapons of ass destruction '' ? 
  probably in the ber ~ ~ a ~ ~ eza kartuska prison .

  i can not wait for the follow-up to the story .

  great minds think alike , buddy . 
  and freedom for the von trapp family . 
  come on , you mentioned tdf yourself in the comment i replied to . 
   i 'd say it 's a thing for far more people then just the far right . 
  yes , it 's become somewhat * fashionable * , even among the dressy subculture , to uncritically praise the soldiers of anti-communist underground and sport a look which can be easiest described as [ ostentatiously patriotic ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=koszulka+patriotyczna&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi9vlwi6bnoahvfkiwkhxfzdbiq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=966 ) ( and borderline retarded ) . 
  however , one can not also deny the fact that both the original * cursed soldiers * and their most vocal fanboys can be easiest described as radical and/or far-right . 
  edit : added a link to some example * patriotic * attire for non-polish readers . 
   there is no real ideology around this despite what some of the opposition friendly folks say . 
  now , you are being blatantly disingenuous . 
  `` the goal of the territorial defence force is to strengthen patriotic and christian foundations of our defence system and the armed forces [ ... ] '' ^ [ 1 ] ( http://300polityka.pl/live/2016/03/10/mon-informuje-poslow-wiara-zolnierzy-bedzie-najlepszym-gwarantem-naszego-bezpieczenstwa/ ) tdf will also actively utilize the * cursed soldiers * phenomenon closely associated with various far right movements ( then and now ) . 
   i think its wrong for the taxpayer to finance people who want to have a promiscuous lifestyle [ ... ] truvada provides additional protection when , for example , your partner is hiv-positive . 
  it 's not only for super-promiscuous folks . 
   i 'm guessing you need to take a few weeks of this drug ( ... ) seven days is enough . 
  theoretically , you could start taking it before going on holidays and stop when you come back . 
  also , # 400 is a fraction of what has to be spent on antiretroviral therapy or treatment for patients with aids .
