  dude , that 's a few blowjobs at a truck stop . 
  it 's not out of your reach , either . 
  and work makes you free . 
  ^ i ^ am ^ getting ^ my ^ coat ^ as ^ we ^ speak . 
  let 's call it `` genocide '' instead . 
  i feel a joke coming ... 
  welcome to the club . 
  probably because he 's in charge of the lighting onstage . 
  it was also fresh . 
  in the 70s . 
  now , it 's your turn . 
  a rabbi , a priest and an imam walk into a bar . 
  the bartender takes a look and says , `` what is this , a fucking joke ? '', 
  there is no horsing around , the joke was shite from the get go . 
  you said your hands were cold and i replied with a line from `` cool hand luke , '' etc. 
  nevermind , the joke was kind of shite , anyway . 
  what we 've got here is failure to communicate . 
  is that you , mr hands ? 
  and loves muddy puddles, 
  excessive use of noise barriers along motorways . 
  it 's delicious , indeed . 
  i have just googled `` soapy coriander '' and it seems the seeds ( most often used for spicing witbier ) do n't contain the aldehydes which make the leaves taste soapy to some people . 
  it probably explains why he tolerates it there . 
  in fresh leaf form only , i hope ? 
  what i mean is : does he find witbier soapy as well ? 
  definitely a healthier alternative . 
  also , delish !, 
  yep . 
  i prefer regular ( fried ) fish with tartar sauce . 
  squeeze a few drops of lemon on it and it 's ready to be gobbled down . 
  `` my safeword is * snausage * , '' said a voice in a dimly lit dungeon . 
  it would make an ok whipping post for a midget , though . 
  thanks , ~ ~ eu ~ ~ merkel . 
  i bet there are trolls dwelling in the mountain . 
  that we do , indeed . 
  do n't listen to him . 
  it was widely reported they were in a relationship . 
  it was a case of a 40-something woman fucking a younger , mentally unstable man . 
  then again , with a new direction , the rebranded show might be successful at attracting a broader ( jihadi ) audience . 
  why would you give them a tv show ? 
  would n't he feel happier in moscow ? 
  * gazes longingly at wilno *, 
  unless the reenactors are hired by our mod . 
  or vienna , 1683 . 
  i believe you are getting it wrong . 
  see , for example , this [ article ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/survey-leaves-no-doubt-syrians-are-fleeing-assad/a-18775789 ) published last year . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dry_water ), 
  or a rapper . 
  in saggy trousers . 
  well , the temperature is so low because it 's winter in the antipodes now . 
  i know what you mean . 
  the fact there 's so much * edginess * on reddit can somehow rub off on even the most casual reader . 
  only if you read too much into it . 
  that 's not saying much . 
  even `` hit me baby one more time '' would be better than `` imagine '' . 
  and here i was thinking cunts came in `` prides '' or `` murders '' . 
   regardless of the validity of her statement , the article is heartbreaking . '', 
  she likes to imagine that richard landed in a field of sunflowers . 
  an australian journalist who went to the crash site sent her some sunflower seeds ; liz has since grown and nurtured them . '', 
  it 's simply haunting . 
  except for the haredim / s, 
  if it does n't impair her performance and/or workplace safety , it 's as stupid as firing someone over a hat . 
  * polout * , as it 's been settled when discussed here previously . 
  fuck that shit ! '', 
  -- frank booth . 
  god damn you all to hell !, 
  ... who are controlled by inter-dimensional shapeshifters !, 
  * hugs *, 
  agreed . 
  why not both . 
  and a bit on the chest , 
  ... and once they run out of goalkeepers , they have to do penalty shots blindfolded , handcuffed , with hot wax dripping on the ball . 
  it was incredible , indeed . 
  a spectacle fit for the finals . 
  theoretically we could have a trump & turnip ticket as boris johnson has n't renounced his us citizenship yet . 
  that would be epic !, 
  having that hairy turnip as the pm would be an endless source of entertainment , though . 
  * looks at your comment and then at your nick * . 
  you wo n't fool us , you monster !, 
  finally , some good news !, 
  well , good for them , i guess . 
  can it fetch a ball though ? 
  vova has just been designated an sp and tom cruise will personally sort him out !, 
  let the battle of shorties commence !, 
  i feel tempted to change my reply to `` he 's working out his eyeballs hard [ ... ] '' , but hey , fuck it , too . 
  his eyeballs probably work out on their own , anyway . 
  his eyeballs are working out hard , hence the sweat . 
  it used to be worse . 
  her predecessor , st. kaczy\u0144ski , banned the parade in 2005 . 
  anyway , never mind . 
  just saying . 
  the current mayor of warsaw , on the other hand , refused to give her support for the event . 
  no way . 
  it 's as russian as pierogi ruskie . 
  ... and vodka !, 
  * ducks *, 
  is a joke ( his mother was slovenian ) . 
  marshal tito is smiling from beyond the grave . 
  safe , blud , safe !, 
  bastian , i love you !,
