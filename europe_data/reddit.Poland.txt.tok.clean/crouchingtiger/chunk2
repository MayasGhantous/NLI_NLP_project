  schland !, 
  and now i 'm hungry . 
  thanks , op !, 
  you 've got a point there . 
  well , how about [ this ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazimierz_doma%c5%84ski ) ? 
   it 's raining again in warsaw 4th day in a row , wtf weather [ ... ] probably a delayed result of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbt21orgne ) , 
  probably not as crazy as natanek , but [ this * miraculous * event ] ( http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2011/10/04/roman-catholics-in-poland-claim-spot-on-communion-wafer-is-part-of-jesus-heart/ ) was quite hilarious . 
  also , a surprising number of people believe in [ faith-healing ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/polish-catholics-flock-to-mass-conducted-by-ugandan-exorcist-a-910035.html ) and other similar voodoo . 
  http://www.unlimited-translate.org/en/dictionaries/ukrainian-to-russian/translate/%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8e%d0%b4.htm  and do you happen to know any russian/ukrainian ? 
  i 'm in my forties . 
  anyone who grew up here in 70s/80s speaks at least some rudimentary russian ( it was a part of curriculum starting from year 4 of primary school ) . 
  anyway , the link to ukr/rus dictionary given above , should clear your confusion . 
   but hey , they 're russians - subhumans , as ukraine 's prime minister called them . 
  citation needed . 
  unless you mean the incident when ' \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044e\u0434\u044c ' was mistakenly translated as ` subhuman ' on ukrainian mfa website . 
  however , these days the term '' \u0425\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043b '' is considered derogatory , and this part of your comment was meant as such . 
   oh , no hesitation for down voting opposing views . 
  actually , some people might be downvoting you because of this little gem :  \u0425\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043b \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0445\u043e\u0445\u043b\u043e\u043c,

  * `` wygwizd\u00f3w '' - a place where the wind whistles/blows ; it [ exists ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/wygwizd%c3%b3w/@51.0980809,19.947195,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4719e76e548a1001:0x7631e642860d6b0f ) irl ; example usage : `` mo\u017ce pojedziemy do radomia ? 
  ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ removed ^ ^ unnecessary ^ ^ vulgarisms, 
  because it is one . 
  the shape reminds me of a [ jelcz 043 ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=jelcz+043&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=tjiru5nqdzhb7aatl4dobw&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=964 ) without the front air intake . 
  i ca n't see any * storming * in the video . 
  all i can see is a bunch of young guys carrying a cake decorated with ' \u0445\u0443\u0439\u043b\u043e ' , as well as a ` putin killer ' poster , making some sort of a political statement at a wrong place . 
  also , * slavic friendship and unity day * was fist celebrated in soviet times ( 1957 ) . 
  ^ ^ so ^ ^ much ^ ^ unity !, 
  ^ ^ such ^ ^ friendship !, 
  sir , have you been drinking ? 
  probably by being fabulous . 
  el diego can be found in the strangest of places . 
  honestly , i really do n't know . 
  sikorski has a history of making strange remarks , i.e. 
  allegedly making a joke about barack obama having polish roots because his granddad ate o polish missionary once , or encouraging some of his subordinates to drink vodka during an office party by exclaiming : `` those who do n't drink with us are a bunch of poofters '' . 
  people he meets in his official capacity might care . 
  the word `` murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 '' is n't racist per se , however connecting it with `` shallow pride and low self-esteem '' definitely is . 
  i always suspected he was a bigoted man , now there 's a proof of it . 
  also , dieudonn\u00e9 comes from a roman catholic family . 
  have you tried opening it in incognito/private mode ? 
  it was sweet !, 
  and congrats , dear neighbour !, 
  oh , ye of little faith  ^ ^ this ^ ^ comment ^ ^ was ^ ^ written ^ ^ at ^ ^ half-time, 
   hope his victim got a real medical care , though . 
  nope , she 's forced to give birth to a baby with anencephaly . 
  wink wink nudge nudge, 
   about 8k-12k people took part in the equality parade [ ... ] in warsaw [ . . ] is [ that ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/foto/zdjecie,iid,1509850,isort,5,itime,1,iaid,120462?parametr=embed_galeria_plaska#ad-image-4 ) a rainbow hussar ? 
  have a safe night . 
  the only people who vote in those elections are recent emigrants . 
  check the number of voters : [ 40000 ] ( http://salon.polonia.net/2010/06/20/wyniki-wyborow-wsrod-polonii-amerykanskiej/ ) against [ your 10 million ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28275d/muslim_population_in_germany/ci6wg2e ) . 
  they are americans ( polish-americans to be precise ) and most of them are well-adjusted . 
  probably less conservative than your neighbours . 
  while it 's produced there , the brand is owned by [ russian standard ] ( http://www.russianstandard.com/brands/cedc ) . 
  ciao , fluffy . 
   invading poland was them breaking the treaty , damn , you polaks really need to stop being so butthurt about things that happened 70 years ago . 
  you are a lot of fun . 
  now , go to bed . 
  you even started using ` ethnic-slurs ' . 
  please , answer the question i asked [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27h25d/what_a_visual_metaphor/ci0zelu ) first . 
  you are sort of cute . 
   stop imagining things . 
  nato is an alliance . 
  m-r pact is a non-agression treaty . 
  words have definitions for a reason . 
  yep . 
  go to bed , son . 
   yes , so it 's a pact of nonagression . 
  again . 
  not an alliance . 
  in spite of you being a real-life number 1.0 . 
  i still hope you do realize the military cooperation between soviets and nazis went way back ( e.g. 
  nazis using proving grounds deep in soviet territory to train , etc. ) . 
   support implies action . 
  not a lack of such again , you are being ridiculous . 
  what happened on 17 september ? 
  lack of action on the soviet part ? 
  you are extremely amusing . 
  why wo n't you just read article 2 of ribbentrop-molotov pact instead ? 
   an alliance is a pact , coalition or friendship between two or more parties , made in order to advance common goals and to secure common interests . 
  [ ... ] staph . 
  in this case it almost is , in everything but the name , dear number 1.0 . 
  you seem to be forgetting the secret protocol of ribbentrop-molotov pact dividing europe into russian and german spheres . 
  i had a chuckle when someone claimed that the bloke next to turchinov in [ this photo ] ( https://twitter.com/kp_steshin/status/474253853043744768 ) was j. dziewulski as a proof of involvement of foreign mercenaries in e. ukraine . 
  not very attractive . 
  i 've had him tagged as a ` puukko-wielding racist ' for a while . 
  then again , it 's probably because of something stupid he said a few months ago . 
  what mercenaries ? 
  it is the other ear , as someone explained [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/27dhhj/nsfw_separatist_bes_executes_hostages_on_camera/chzzp1f ) . 
  what a muppet , seriously . 
  i do n't think their support for the russians is a recent development . 
  iirc members of polish minority supported the communists and opposed lithuanian independence in the 90s . 
   on the other hand , in poland a popular opposition party is vocally supporting polish minority in lithuania [ ... ] someone should point out to our opposition that polish electoral action is quite cosy with the russian minority in lithuania . 
  you must be talking about the famous sealed train lenin traveled in through germany . 
  you should probably ask bibi about it . 
  why not ? 
  it really does n't sound that bad for a young family who would n't otherwise be able to afford a spacious flat with an easy access to a school . 
  cheap , subsidized housing combined with fairly decent standards of living ? 
  and radom . 
  there 's no justice . 
   to take polish jobs ftfy, 
  it is hilarious .
