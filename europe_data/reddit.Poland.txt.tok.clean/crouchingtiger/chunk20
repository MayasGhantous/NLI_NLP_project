  i doubt we 'll have lived under l&j rule for only one term before a party with more moderate views takes over . 
  look , another vicious ** german ** attack on the christ of the nations !, 
  a google-translated excerpt from [ this page ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/nascita_della_repubblica_italiana ) : a girl celebrating the birth of the republic by showing a copy of the corriere della sera with the news of the results . 
  the famous photo ( depicting probably a model ) , was taken to the weekly time ( edition of june 15 , 1946 ) by federico patellani photographer as part of a celebratory photo service of the republic and the new role of women [ 37 ] , and it was proposed also on the front page by the same courier , and subsequently re-used in many campaigns and posters . 
  you have my undying gratitude for your service ... * takes hat off * ... my liege !, 
  all good points . 
  however the relevant part of the article is the infamous rogozin quote directed at moldova . 
  since i had posted the previous comment i found a study by the swedish defense research agency on gazprom . 
  it 's a bit dated and quite lengthy but might be worth a read if you are into that sort of thing . 
  you can find it [ here ] ( https://www.academia.edu/14199244/gazprom_study ) . 
  personally , i can not be bothered . 
  they used puffin party . 
  according to [ this page ] ( http://www.athosfriends.org/pilgrimsguide/visit/ ) , showers are available for pilgrims . 
   monks are not much given to bathing , though the sea is used for baptism . 
  visitors who wish to bathe should do so out of sight of monasteries . 
  officially both bathing and fishing are forbidden . 
  some guest houses are now equipped with showers , but hot water remains a rarity . 
  what has the world come to ? 
   in athos , all water is considered holy water , taking a bath is therefore forbidden . 
  so it 's showers only ? 
  or do they wash in basins or bowls ? 
  are there any restrictions on hot water as well ? 
  genuinely interested . 
  did you hear that ? 
  what was that ? 
  joke \\ \u02c8j\u014dk \\ * noun * something said or done to cause laughter,

  it 's not coincidence that the best crosses are wooden crosses !, 
  we are talking about 33 plaintiffs at 10 million a pop . 
  i would n't be surprised if they manage to recover at least some of it - if they win , of course . 
  it does n't matter . 
  if they are awarded the compensation , russian assets can be seized . 
  only poland and malta iirc . 
  there was also a string of so-called gaybomber incidents in 2005 .

  i believe * kwik kwik * is the squealing sound and * chrum chrum * is the grunting one . 
  doubt it . 
  they might be taking the mickey .

  from the article :  police earlier uncovered an illicit workshop where the lotion was being made , and arrested its owners . 
   this is some pretty extreme shit . 
  what a funny way of saying `` awesome ! '', 
  if you are after that sort of thing , i 'd suggest jon mcnaughton 's [ one nation under god ] ( http://jonmcnaughton.com/patriotic/americana/new-category/ ) . 
  there are other * noteworthy * paintings in the `` patriotic '' section . 
  no way !, 
  i doubt it 's available now . 
  if i 'm not mistaken it was released this spring and sold out fairly quickly . 
  you can always ask pp on their facebook page , though .

  welcome to the 4th republic , buddy .
