   lukasik replied in polish : `` let comrade mauser speak '' -- an apparent reference to a german semi-automatic pistol [ ... ] in fact , it 's probably an unintended reference to `` left march '' by mayakovsky - i believe the quote goes `` comrade mauser , you have the floor '' in the english version . 
  oh , the irony of dumb fascists quoting soviet revolutionary poetry !,

  not really , although some far-right initiatives often enjoy tacit approval if not outright support of some pis politicians or individuals connected to them .

  on a side note : islamic terrorism would be rather hard to accomplish in a country as homogeneous as poland , and our lefties are as soft as butter .

  are you sure about the uniforms ? 
  hitler-jugend was established in 1922 , onr a decade or so later . 
  do n't know . 
  you should ask a police spokesperson about it . 
  afaik some of them wore `` police '' t-shirts which clearly identified them as members of the force . 
  cry me a fucking river about unfair treatment of regular hooligans . 
  btw , those cops are wearing balaclavas for a reason , so scum sympathetic to organizers - who actually proclaimed yesterday they wanted to `` overthrow the republic '' - ca n't post their faces on fascist/ultra 's forums .

  if you have any better ideas how to conduct humane wars ( here 's an oxymoron if i 've ever seen one ) , please share them . 
  as to `` most powerful nation on the planet going to war against a next to helpless foe '' - it 's called asymmetrical warfare - and iraqis were nothing from hopeless - and it 's been quite bloody for all parties involved ( often due to politics it 's more than two belligerents ) . 
  anyway , you are still wrong . 
  the invasion in question was a perfect example what modern army can accomplish - bad governance and neocon unwilingness to compromise is no reason to dismiss the feat of ingenuity military commanders manged to accomplish . 
  take it up with your leaders and spare me the sound-bite . 
  ireland is neutral - you have no voice . 
  kudos to you . 
  you still do n't understand . 
  modern warfare is often conducted in urbanized environment . 
  i believe you suffer from some sort of selective reading syndrome . 
  even better : talk to persons who have been involved in recent conflicts ( iraq , afghanistan ) . 
  just do n't wear you beloved kaffiyah . 
  you might get a grasp of the level they sometimes go to avoid civilian casualties . 
  look , you still do n't understand . 
  war is hell , always . 
  yet iraq war was performed ( for the lack of better word ) in more humane manner than most wars . 
  i 'd expect more from a person with croatian flair , if you know what i mean . 
  it 's not . 
  the stats ( red cross , fairly unbiased ) have been taken ** since ** mid century . 
  take a class in reading comprehension . 
  civvies to combatants ratios were even worse in the times before . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  you took time to reply but could n't be bothered to even google it ? 
  [ here 's the favourite source of reddit . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilian_casualty_ratio ) . 
  what did you think war was ? 
  bunnies and roses ? 
  you are completely wrong . 
  it 's a very impressive civilian casualty ratio . 
  in most conflicts it 's 10:1 ( 10 civilians to one combatant ) . 
  read about it before you speak . 
  also , putin 's favourite song is `` every breath you take '' by the police . 
  yes . 
  not a single body had gunshot wounds . 
  enough ? 
  please , just do n't . 
  it has been debunked countless times . 
  the military prosecutor has just denied the allegation during a televised press conference . 
  he said the they had detected trace elements which might just as well turn to be interference or measurement error ( pvc , cosmetics , etc. ) . 
  further test are needed and it 's certainly way too early to jump to conclusions pis leadership have been spewing around . 
  also , he denied any traces of explosives had been found on the bodies , etc. 
  in other words : it 's most likely bullshit . 
  conspiratards from the opposition party - pis - are having a field day ; their leader ( the other twin brother ) has already referred to the accident as follows : `` the murder of 96 people was a heinous crime and everyone involved must bear the consequences . '', 
  the sad thing is , according to the polls some 25 % of the population share his conspiratorial views .
