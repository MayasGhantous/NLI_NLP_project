  however , the time schedule of the project given in the article was overoptimistic as there 's quite a lot of resistance and general nimby sentiment among the local population . 
   ( ... ) finding out if it passed and when is probably going to be almost impossible . 
  the project has just been rejected with 245 to 184 votes ( with 10 abstentions ) which means no further changes to the abortion laws in near future . 
  and goatse , the holiest of all . 
  i 've only asked because i 've seen the same rhetoric on some north american websites ( antiwar , counterpunch , etc. ) . 
  sorry , it was none of my business . 
  as to sanctions : economic boycott did sort of work in case of south africa . 
  we 'll see if it 'll bring the desired effects in this case . 
   i would rather live in a nuclear bomb free world , but ( ... ) why should we kill off so many innocent iranians to supposedly keep iran from possibly developing one ? 
  nobody 's talking about killing anyone yet . 
  development of nuclear weapons by iran might just start a nuclear arms race in me and i guess it 's something europe would rather avoid . 
  also , you seem to put a lot of faith and trust in iranian regime ( no offence intended but you do sound a lot like a left-wing american , are you one ? ), 
  right now nobody is starving to death , correct ? 
  and regime change can only be accomplished by iranian people themselves . 
  a scenario where masses come to the streets and demand change is imho preferable to us military intervention and plausible once iranian economy collapses . 
  what 's your solution ? 
  i hope it 's not lobbing missiles at every possible military target . 
  probably still worth trying . 
  the alternative scares the bejeezus out of me . 
  the sanctions will probably weaken iranian regime and force them to negotiating table . 
  the sooner , the better . 
   an eu-wide severing of financial ties with iran 's banking system would in practice hamper the islamic republic 's transactions in euros , limiting them to debt payment and purchase of food and medicine . 
  `` cockwombles '' . . or maybe `` uwe boll films '' ? 
  sure . 
  or a guy who calls serbians `` slavic scum . '', 
  you never know . 
  not necessarily so . 
  he might be a bona fide white supremacist / new right supporter just as well . 
  i find it simply obnoxious - especially when coming from jp2 , a senile old fool who had a nerve to prohibit the use of condoms in the midst of hiv/aids epidemic in africa . 
  the same man on whose watch systematic child abuse was routinely covered-up ( his good buddy dziwisz was involved in maciel affair , etc. ) . 
  civilization of life ? 
  more like glorification of needless suffering . 
  no `` kuciapka '' ? 
  i know it 's quaint but i hope it 'll make a come back . 
  [ `` the enemy is tempting you with coca-cola '' ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x-eijluxxoo/tcbhj4esqui/aaaaaaaaan4/dbwgfzudmdg/s640/img_2384.jpg ), 
  it happened in the very early '50s , not '70s . 
  the authorities published a communique stating the american saboteurs air-dropped potato bugs into the baltic , the bugs swam to the shore and spread inland . 
  seriously . 
  a bit . 
  but that 's what i 'd expect form a scandinavian country anyway . 
  [ also , high taxes might be a price well-worth paying in this case ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/denmark/ ) but you should probably ask a dane about it , wojtek . 
  cheers . 
  are there any chances of denmark changing the current drug policy to minimize the illegal profits from hashish trade ( and as such forcing the gangs to find a different source of revenue ) ? 
   this tax is paid form users of motor vehicles for road haulage with a permissible ** gross laden weight of 12 tones or more ** good . 
  vehicles of that weight are responsible for a lot of road damage . 
  yes , that 's the one i think . 
  i was under an assumption black cobras was larger than that , thanks for clarifying . 
  then you live in a bubble . 
  things of that sort happen quite often . 
  thanks for explanation . 
  most of what i know about the subject i 've learnt from a few newspaper articles and [ this aljazeera report ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktby_3oosna ), 
  absolutely . 
  they are allegedly quite big in denmark and sweden . 
  i think there was a major conflict between those two a few years ago . 
  the only major muslim gang i can think of is black cobras . 
  have n't you ever heard about hells angels , bandidos or any other motorcycle gangs/clubs ? 
  but can you personally vouch for the neighbourhood the incident took place in ? 
   you 're in a decent neighborhood ( ... ) [ decent ? 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/marseille-europes-most-dangerous-place-to-be-young-8166738.html ), 
  wait ... are n't those the same poorest districts of marseille ross kemp filmed one of his programmes in ? 
  [ video for those who have n't seen it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsmbhpntv0q ), 
  the solid infrastructure bit certainly is n't . 
  railways are in a state of disarray , inland waterways are even worse , the power grid is highly inefficient with up to 12 % losses , etc. 
  people write the darndest things in comments sections . 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  homosexuality was often referred to as `` a ( nationality ) vice '' in the past , not `` a ( nationality ) disease '' . 
  i guess i should have made it clearer . 
  did you mean `` the french vice '' by any chance ? 
  try [ baba ghanoush ] ( http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baba-ghanoush-2/ ) . 
  use a fork instead of a blender . 
  easy and delicious !, 
   have an upvote , then . 
  mmmm , it felt like a kiss ... 
   pretending to be cats ?!, 
  i am at a loss for words , this is just too weird . 
  `` cat '' ( kot ) means something along the lines of `` a freshman '' in informal polish . 
  btw , i 'm not trying to defend those fairly distasteful and bizarre rites , just explaining . 
  no , i was n't serious . 
  i thought including the part about the musical tastes in his younger days would indicate it sufficiently . 
  i do n't . 
  medvedev seems to be quite reasonable . 
  he even was a fan of black sabbath in his youth !, 
  at least putin is n't grooming one of his kids ( yet ) to [ become the next dictator ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/whos-that-boy-in-the-grey-suit-its-kolya-lukashenko--the-next-dictator-of-belarus-7897089.html ), 
  you are right about some of those issues , however you forgot to mention deeply conservative leanings of major political parties ( lgbt rights , abortion , drug policies , etc. ), 
  - that certainly puts them closer to american right . 
  also a few words of explanation for non-poles : healthcare in poland is n't `` free '' - the system is based on general health insurance ( `` sk\u0142adka zdrowotna '' ) which costs 9 % of your income if you are employed . 
  if you are n't , the state pays for it most of the time ( try visiting a doctor without valid insurance ), 
  of course it was n't because of romney - he was n't even an official presidential candidate in 2011 . 
  however one must remember a large portion of polish politicians are closer ideologically to republicans . 
  yes . 
  he even refused to meet obama with an excuse of prior engagements . 
  ... with fried tofu bombs !, 
  militant vegetarians ? 
  it actually say a lot about those bellends burning embassies . 
  salafists have money . 
  a metric fucktonne of money allowing for global expansion - they really are everywhere . 
  i 've seen quite a few discussions about the poor state of ummah when i lurked through the subreddit this afternoon . 
  something good might actually come out of this whole embarrassment if muslims take it seriously . 
  they must be feeling slightly embarrassed by what 's been happening , eh ? 
  i 'm really looking forward to delusional antics of all conservative fractions ( and i mean all : pis , sp , psl , po ) during the forthcoming civil union and ivf debates .
