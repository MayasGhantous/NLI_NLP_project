  it 'll be buckets of fun all around . 
  are we talking about the same po ? 
  the party of zelek , gowin , libicki , and niesiolowski ? 
  the bill will be supported by palikot 's movement and sld only ( in spite of the frictions between leaders of those two parties ) . 
  i doubt you 'll find more than a handful of civic platform mps willing to vote for it . 
  in other words , there 's no chance of the bill successfully passing through the parliament . 
  ca n't see anything wrong with that . 
  i might even call them ideal immigrants as they probably substantially increased economic growth of the region . 
   yep it was a desert . 
  that 's why ben-gurion wanted to make use of the fellahin ( farmers ) , because they were sitting on their asses not planting anything . 
  just in case you were being sarcastic ( i quite admire ben-gurion and do n't know the quote ) : it 's not as if they simply came and dispossessed everyone - the immigrant zionists purchased the often infertile land fair and square . 
   why did n't the us accept jews ? 
  ( ... ) antisemitism was rife in those days . 
  everywhere . 
   tere 's a lot of anti-arab and anti-muslim sentiment in europe ( ... ) agreed . 
  as you have shown it was n't 50.000 per year . 
  they are relatively small numbers who came into a country which was mostly wasteland . 
  funny the desert gradually * started to bloom * once they got there . 
   you really think that 's normal ? 
  if muslims came to your country in the same manner , would you welcome them with open arms ? 
  yes , it 's normal and i 'd welcome muslims here . 
  except for salafist scum , of course . 
   just imagine if every european country took a couple of thousand jews , the world could have avoided such a horrendous act that will forever stain human history . 
  what the hell are you on about ? 
  most of europe was occupied by nazis , so it would n't really help much . 
  also , the war did n't start because of the jews - have n't you heard about the policy of lebensraum ? 
   if i came back in time , i would have supported the 1947 partition plan . 
  i 'm glad you 've said it . 
  so much pain and suffering could have been avoided . 
  i can help but see arab intervention as the greatest tragedy that happened to your people . 
   ( the part about anti-semitism and holocaust denial ) sorry , i simply refuse to justify such bigotry . 
  there 's not justification for demonisation of an entire ethnic group or a nation . 
   zionists/israelis were the original aggressors ( ... ) so , you call immigrants aggressors now ? 
  that 's a second enlightening insight into your personality - the first one was `` jews ( or at least european jews ) never came in peace to palestine . '', 
  also , do n't get melodramatic : the numbers of immigrants during many aliyot which happened in 19th-20th century were much smaller - not 50.000 per year ( more like 10 thousand or less per year ) . 
  as to your question : i would n't mind 50.000 muslims if my city could accommodate it . 
  unfortunately it 's smallish with population below 100.000 . 
  however , my opinion might not be shared by others living here . 
  the statelessness of palestinians can only be blamed on uncompromising attitudes of your politicians . 
  you should also thank arab nations who graciously decided to invade newly created israel in 1948 . 
  palestinian poverty can be at least partially attributed to massive corruption and misappropriation of funds . 
  it 's not as if there were n't luxurious estates in gaza and west bank . 
  oh yes , you are n't nazis . 
  only some of you sympathise with them . 
  and it seems to go back to ww2 as the example of that al-hussaini bastard shows . 
  it 's a bit sad 3 redditors have down-voted you without giving any justification at all . 
  i only hope it was n't due to the declaration in your first sentence . 
  look , i believe stupidquestionredux was only pointing out the phenomenon of [ suicide bombers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_palestinian_suicide_attacks ) some palestinians seem to admire ( `` we love death more than life '' and such bollocks ) . 
  also , when listing examples of zionist violence you should expect a counter-list of massacres and pogroms your peace-loving people committed before and after the establishment of israel , such as those in [ jerusalem , 1920 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_palestine_riots ) , [ hebron , 1929 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_hebron_massacre ) , [ safed , 1929 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_safed_massacre ) , even [ a massacre of doctors and nurses in 1948 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadassah_medical_convoy_massacre ) . 
  ** seriously , do n't pretend your people are only innocent victims . 
  ** the history of political and religious violence committed by your brethren is also * impressive * . 
  knowing who coined it would be a nice piece of trivia . 
  all free speech issues aside : sorry , it does n't answer my question . 
  all i wanted is a name of a person who decided it was fine to call four countries with impressive history and impact on european culture by a name usually associated with a mammal ( unjustly ) accused of low intelligence ( even for animal standards ) , dirtiness ( also unjustly , pigs are clean if they are given a chance ) , and funny sounds . 
  hmmm , gips sounds even worse ... / ducks, 
  who came up with that stupid and degrading acronym anyway ? 
  i 'm not telling anyone to get their pitchforks or give him a proper seeing to , but some sort of a reprimand would be in place . 
  there should be a more neutral word for this particular group of countries - why wo n't we start calling it `` peppa countries '' to make it all happy-oinky ? 
  when you have a minute have a look at [ this ] ( http://www.dialektologia.uw.edu.pl/index.php?l1=opis-dialektow ) . 
  it 's not as uniform as one might imagine . 
   with the exceptions including silesians , kashubians and some small groups of other ethnic minorities cough-gorale-cough . 
  how could you forget about them ? 
  they are the most unintelligible of the lot . 
  and they are as native to the land as you 'll ever be . 
  by the way , kashubian is a separate language , not a polish dialect . 
  not with bilingual children . 
  as long as you start learning early enough , it 's not difficult at all .

  with `` proletarianism '' instead of `` toffiness '' - seriously , walesa 's working-class roots still show whenever he speaks ( and there 's absolutely nothing wrong with that ) . 
  well , it 's fairly decent in my book . 
  then again , i might be a tad too accustomed to low standards of polish journalism . 
  oldie but goldie : while staying at windsor castle lech walesa complained about not being able to find his wife in bed due to its large size ^ [ link ] ( http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/lech-walesa-windsor-castle-bed-was-too-big/id-2a95578e863eab333171dc2110ff8a8f ), 
  rubber dinghy rapids , blud . 
  raczej nie = probably not, 
  they will once they learn how to french polish . 
  not to me , mate . 
  euro wo n't magically increase the wages in poland . 
  it 'll be a long time before standard of life even remotely resembles the one in western europe . 
  also , the slutties simply love them some foreign and exotic dick . 
  why ? 
  an adoption of the common currency by poland should n't stem the steady supply of this particular product . 
  so he can tie an onion to it . 
  i 'd rather assume they were really , really stoned while taking the tests . 
  anyway , nevermind . 
  those might be natives , it 's not explicitly stated they are immigrants . 
  anyway , fun blog !, 
  there was a submission yesterday about the rise of golden dawn linking to some white supremacist website ( did n't know it at the time ) . 
  after clicking the link i found about half a dozen `` hitler '' ads . 
  op 's posting history was equally enlightening : / r/conspiracy , / r/niggers , / r/ronpaul , etc. 
  happy birthday * , learnaave !, 
  * edit : cakeday ? 
  with self-entitlement like that it might even be the balfour declaration . 
  so they burn a kindergarten in response to police violence ? 
  does n't make sense . 
  agreed . 
  the system should motivate all able-bodied residents ( be it native or immigrants ) to be productive members of the society . 
  thank you !,
