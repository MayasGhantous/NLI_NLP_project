  having just skimmed through the report it seems the poles are n't your biggest `` problem '' ( 7th place , most claimants come from asia and africa ) . 
  overall 6.6 % rate for non-uk claimants is n't that bad - i expected some really apocalyptic number after you earlier remarks . 
  are there any statistics available to support your claims ? 
  btw , does n't your government implement any programmes for long-term unemployed ? 
  if no such schemes exist , it 's really wasteful . 
   work for a year and claim benefits for life did you even read the article ? 
  they receive jsa for a lengthy period of 3 months . 
  you get rid of them for a total of 180 quid per person - it 's a good deal imho . 
  i might be wrong but i 've heard there 's more control over benefit recipients in germany ( the system is more extensive as well ) . 
  anyway , if what you are saying is true ( not some hateful daily mail scaremongering ) and all they do is leech/abuse the system in uk , why wo n't your government do something about it ? 
  seems like there are quite a few employment opportunities there . 
  [ i bet it 's not an isolated case ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/y74b0/germanys_el_dorado_why_thousands_of_jobless/ ), 
  they 'd most likely go to germany anyway . 
  your scarce and precious british jobs would safe ( ... but not from my compatriots ) . 
  would n't wearing knickers on a daily basis by a male ( as opposed to a leisurely pursuit ) be highly uncomfortable ? 
  the population of albania is just over 3 million ; the number would be fairly negligible . 
   fuck the us , why do we still need visas to visit ? 
  it 's 2012 , 8 years since joining the eu and still we need visas . 
  the answer is really simple : poland does n't fulfil requirements for vwp , i.e. 
  visa refusal rate is 9.8 % instead of 3 % . 
  \u266b should we blame the government ? 
  \u266b \u266b or blame society ? 
  \u266b ( ... ) \u266b no , blame germany !, 
  \u266b \u266b blame germany !, 
  it 's happened in greece and the perpetrators are those evil germans ... really pathetic indeed . 
  you are just saying that because you do n't want to share the technology with the rest of mankind !, 
  the cat is out the bag now - it 's time for full disclosure . 
  it also explains why the population of lithuania has been steadily [ decreasing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:population_of_lithuania.png ) since the 90s . 
  is that a stargate on image no . 
  poland : no limits on the length of the blade at all ( you could carry a machete if you 'd like to ) . 
  knives or blades hidden in other objects ( e.g. 
  a cane ) are forbidden . 
  cloud city !, 
  the necessary technology will be available by the time we have federal europe . 
  look at the thread again - the idiocy started with bbskane 's cliche deflection . 
  what was the point of dragging us into the argument , really ? 
  his response reminded me of `` you are lynching negroes '' or similar arguments . 
  please do n't get offended but i 'm afraid the discussion here has sunk to the level of ideological wankery i promised myself i would try to avoid . 
  have a good one . 
  a valid criticism of us policies which has bugger all to do with the fact the sponsors of the resolution were morally bankrupt . 
  please look at the list of sponsors of the resolution as well as those who voted ` yes ' - shining beacons of freedom and human rights , were n't they ? 
  the second story from box_of_carrots ' post sounds a bit like [ the previous episode in the same season ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0speubbpgc ) sans the language problem . 
  is n't air transport of surstr\u00f6mming potentially dangerous ? 
  good catch . 
  omsk 's in asia . 
  [ a bit like this ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:rooster_portrait2.jpg `` what a lovely cock ! '' ), 
  as much as using the * holocaust card * ( that 's what new barbarians call it , is n't it ? ), 
  might derail the discussion , in this particular case there was no hope for any rational discourse from get-go . 
  the religious will always answer `` who the hell are politicians or lawmakers to suggest any changes to millennia-old religious rites ? '', 
   we have already heard ridiculous comparisons of outlawing circumcisions with holocaust . 
  you are stretching the truth . 
  `` worst attack on jewish life since holocaust '' is a far cry from such comparison . 
  no , i do n't really care about you or your politics . 
  sorry for replying second time : i think i see now what you meant when hinting at ` muslim bashing ' - decebalus ( op ) seems to have an agenda and submitted 5 or 6 articles about muslims within the past couple of hours . 
  while ` call for ' might be more appropriate , let 's not get over-sensitive about it . 
  ca n't really see any examples of muslim bashing in the article - just a few dozen sentences about increased demand during ramadan and a brief mention of a silly controversy instigated by le pen . 
   the article does n't mention the many kosher products available for the jewish population . 
  which muslims are allowed to consume anyway . 
  [ storm clouds ? 
  how about a tornado ?

  ` goyim ' is plural . 
  bad grammar = bad trolling . 
  have you seen this ? 
  while i * generally * agree with your rationale ( although i do n't really consider male circumcision `` mutilation '' , that term is fully reserved for fgm in my book ) i 'm still sceptical about the outcome of the campaign . 
  guess we 'll see in the near future if it brings desired effects . 
  i hope the backlash from the muslim community , especially salafists with whom germany seems to have some problems , wo n't be too serious . 
   darwin awards ? 
  i thought babies were excluded from the competition as you have to be a willing participant . 
  it 's the muslim community i 'm worried about as well . 
  i doubt they will give it up either . 
   the die hard religious will keep killing their children probably , but i 'm quite serious when i say that i ca n't help but see the silver lining in that . 
  do n't be a dick . 
  are they lesser human beings because they are religious ? 
  god requires it as a token from the jews . 
  in fact god requires a shitload more from them compared with gentiles . 
  it might not make any sense for you and me but apparently it does for them . 
  by the way , what if the law backfires and we 'll see and increased number of deaths due to non-medical and unhygienic circumcisions ? 
  i do n't think they brag about - it 's simply required from them . 
  obviously , circumcision only makes sense from a religious perspective - the only medical benefit i 've come across is reduction in hiv transmission but i think condoms are better at the job ( and work both ways ) . 
  it 's a sign a covenant with god commanded to all jews . 
  and yes , it 's not necessary in order to ` get into heaven ' - being righteous is what is required ( gentiles have as big a chance at it as well ) . 
  gehenna is not hell , it 's more like a purgatory . 
  brit is too big a deal for the religious - they would rather leave . 
  [ there was a discussion on the subject in / r/judaism a few weeks ago - see what they have to say ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/judaism/comments/vmkrs/german_judges_rule_parents_can_be_brought_to/ ), 
   according to him it sounds like they 're in danger of being exterminated or expelled from germany i understood it differently : the members of \u00fcber-religious community should probably leave germany if they can not follow the first mitzvah . 
  what would you like him to suggest instead ? 
  a maccabean revolt no . 
  i suppose [ doctomoe 's explanation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/wdmgd/pope_benedict_xvi_sues_german_satire_magazine/c5ch66k ) is equally fitting . 
  did n't know that . 
  that 's why i wrote `` drafted '' instead of `` joined '', 
  i 'm wondering if he mentioned fanta because it was first introduced to the market in nazi-germany about the same time young ratzinger was drafted into hitler-jugend ... 
  although i disagree with your definition of `` the norm '' - thank you for your honesty . 
   celebration of sexual ** deviation ** are you serious ? 
  do you really consider homosexuality a sexual deviation and not one of the equally valid orientations ? 
  ukrainian parliament had a similar bill in the works - it was stopped last friday after a successful international campaign [ link ] ( http://www.advocate.com/news/world-news/2012/07/06/ukrainian-lawmakers-pull-antigay-bill-after-international-outcry ), 
  as it should be - all units with ec sensors require calibration at least once a year . 
  agreed . 
  manufacturers of the testing kits will be over the moon as well .
