  some folks have already used conchita for [ election purposes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2xvbx0xhvo ) here as an example of depraved eu values ( the relevant part starts at approx . 
  40s mark ) . 
  nah , he does n't look awkward . 
  * patriotic * volk are numerous and stronk in poland . 
  i think it was one of those [ special occasions ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20286409 ) when all sorts of vermin come out of woodwork . 
  marches and rallies are organized everywhere , even in small towns . 
  your very own nick griffin gave a speech in krak\u00f3w last year . 
  wait , was freddie responsible for the collapse of the only true and pure civilization , the soviet union ? 
  or is it simply a coincidence that crisis descended on mr putin homeland a few years after this video had been released ? 
  that explains it , i suppose . 
  what 's up with [ those ] ( http://imgur.com/iyjf2qp ) . 
  is there a story here or were those randomly chosen ? 
  you got that right , magnad , damn right . 
  come on , a man in a dress would be confusing for the children , and mr sztompke !, 
   there are also issues with the process of decision-making , i.e. 
  the act was chosen in a non-transparent manner , we did n't even get to find out if there were any other contenders . 
  all of this on taxpayers ' dime . 
  the irony is even more delicious once you realize he was a member of an almost all-male team responsible for selecting our production this year . 
  make all the fun you want , the reality is somehow [ scarier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbyoe9qf2uu ) . 
  i loved the french song as well , although iceland 's performance was even more [ stimulating ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8owy2se.jpg ) . 
  not necessarily so . 
  i found out today my septuagenarian mother voted for him and she did n't even notice the beard at first . 
   * in their general direction *, 
  i checked the list of jury members and found a snippet from a radio interview given by the main juror , pawe\u0142 sztompke , in which he complained how he could n't even watch `` that wurst 's '' performance , how he could n't even tell if the performer was male or female , etc. 
  he concluded with `` show-business has gone too far '' . 
  so , here 's your explanation , i guess . 
  meh , they were better back [ in the day . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srada7flvpq ), 
  do n't be butthurt . 
  our act was shite . 
  / wiggling a tail like a doge /, 
  there it is , the nanny state interfering in my affairs again . 
  shoosh . 
  let me by until monday , you monster . 
  the boos came from the crowd tonight . 
  still , a bit sad indeed . 
  it 's ok . we are all drunk and/or high anyway . 
  i meant the french band when i mentioned the precarious hairdo . 
  as to conchita , i believe he 's a drag act and as such we should refer to him as something completely otherwordly . 
  conchita was divine !, 
  it was a good , meaningful song and some truly impressive hair . 
  politics and broadly understood arts/kitschy singing performances do n't mix , it seems . 
  as if our act was any classier . 
  wait , it was the most exploitative thing imaginable . 
  i 'm happy for conchita !, 
  best day ever !, 
  love you conchita !, 
  i 'm trembling in anticipation . 
  i think you are too hard on them . 
  it 's a run-of-the-mill hip-hoppity song , nothing that horrible . 
  there are no quarter-finals . 
  or do you mean * semis * ? 
  i enjoy this aspect as much as the next straight guy , yet i still find it quite cheap and exploitative . 
  if the rehearsals are any indication , you should probably prepare for disappointment in this regard tonight . 
  did you see the rehearsal video ? 
  what is it even supposed to be ? 
  the end result is a shouty song with a dance routine so minimal , you can hardly call it a show . 
  the least they could do is spice it up a bit with a couple of squatting slavs in the back , 
  they should feel lucky they did n't succeed . 
  remember the dude in pakistan who died from toxic fumes inhalation after he set us flag on fire ? 
  imagine prince philip there . 
  comedy gold . 
  absolutely fringe . 
  also , deluded communists . 
  spin0 probably submitted it for shits and giggles . 
  not bad at all , probably comparable to some western countries . 
  afaik compulsory education made great strides once it was introduced in the interwar period , however adult illiteracy was only dealt with after ww2 through mandatory programs . 
  the differences between regions could also be seen in 1918 illiteracy levels : 57 % of the population in former russian territories could n't read/write , 40 % in austrian-hungarian , and only 5 % in prussian ^ [ * ] ( http://books.google.pl/books?id=_75stizo7wac&amp;pg=pa259&amp;lpg=pa259&amp;dq=analfabetyzm+w+zaborze+pruskim&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=akxv1hdptt&amp;sig=8-pvhzg1id_qanj7yolvkii2gdi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=sqrou9qdnftb7abgu4hqbw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=analfabetyzm%20w%20zaborze%20pruskim&amp;f=false ), 
  there was also a substitute denim-like fabric called texas / arizona used by a local state company to make something resembling jeans - [ odras ] ( http://www.gs24.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20120903/magazyn01/373832877 ) . 
  i suppose everyone did , even romanians we saw in those slightly depressing pictures uploaded yesterday . 
  it 's not even a proper ice cream truck - it 's an [ fsc \u017buk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fsc_%c5%bbuk ) with a larger thermos thrown in the back . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  the only point to be made here is the one about op sucking donkey 's balls . 
  unless of course he 's misleading redditors in / r/europe on purpose . 
  some people will upvote anything as long as they believe it shows * their enemy * in negative light . 
  the only funny thing here is the fact this video is over a year old . 
  see : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej9q_btmpki ) or [ here ] ( http://www.ochevidets.ru/rolik/45733/ ) . 
  here it used to be `` peace , labour , socialism '' ( pok\u00f3j praca socjalizm ) or some variation thereof . 
  looks like one . 
  might be a lada though . 
   [ ... ] there are speculations and rumors if he has cancer and that is the reason for his kamikaze-like activity ; are those still the same rumours about his spinal cord cancer is it something different this time around ? 
  also , the banner with '' \u041c\u0438\u0440 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d '' is priceless - i 've just head a flashback from the early 80s . 
  it 's a part of a longer video that can be found [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb6axle-srq ) . 
  btw , do n't you think a new megathread should be created for all things ukrainian ? 
  the frontpage of / r/europe is basically swamped with this stuff . 
  that 's how brave patriots behave , right ? 
  ah , [ you seem to be right ] ( http://brianhigbee.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/icepick3-popup.jpg ) . 
  are n't there some mountains and glaciers not far from mexico city ? 
  so , maybe he went glacier climbing in his free time . 
  was n't trotsky killed with a small pickaxe ? 
  it would n't stop me if i liked it . 
  same here . 
  although i know of one made in poland by a russian-owned company - it 's \u017bubr\u00f3wka ( bison grass vodka ) . 
  while he was n't the nicest guy in the world , dudaev is n't generally considered a terrorist . 
  they are czechs and they wanted to do it on the cheap ( sorry ) . 
  as insensitive as it was they managed to round up 20 ` suspects ' by targeting the friday prayers . 
  imagine the surveillance costs if they had to conduct a proper operation and target only those strictly involved in preaching hatred . 
  by that logic chechen terrorists in beslan were your friends . 
  also , speak for yourself . 
  if small arms use constitutes terrorism nowadays , we 'll probably have to call some protesters at maidan terrorists as well ( i know , the protesters in kiev were repeatedly attacked beforehand , etc. ) .
