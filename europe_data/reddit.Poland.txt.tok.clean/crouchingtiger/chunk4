  what we witnessed tonight was banditism pure and simple . 
  putin 's playbook . 
  guess who won tonight ? 
  it 's only understandable once we come to conclusion that men are nothing but mindless beasts . 
  also , there we go again with the overused word ` terrorist ' . 
  i 'd rather call them ` poor misguided sods ' - on both sides . 
  i know what happened . 
  i watched the streams for the most part of the evening . 
  and still , we already have people trying to justify it here in / r/europe , e.g. 
  [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24jl91/pro_and_antimaidan_rallies_clash_in_odessa_live/ ), 
  pogroms : beautiful to behold . 
  there 's something wrong with you if you condone violent mobs . 
  and that 's a perfectly good reason to go on a rampage . 
  this tragedy will only help putin . 
  there 's absolutely nothing to celebrate here as trycatch1 did when he said :  odessa demonstrated today that it 's truly a hero city . 
  are you trying to defend what happened ? 
  it was a couple of hundreds besieging a few dozens . 
  yobs against yobs . 
  we should be ashamed . 
  you should and it 's a pity you do n't . 
  look , people who come to kill are usually well-armed and 30-odd men with automatic weapons would be perfectly able to defend themselves from the mob . 
  seriously , i watched the mob on their way to the union house smashing election posters and there was nothing heroic about them . 
  basically young adults with baseball bats and clubs out for revenge . 
  then , the stream was cut and i was only able to watch the aftermath on a different stream . 
  so , excuse me if i wo n't support mindless violence and i will partially blame your kiev authorities - as incompetent and impotent as they are - for this unfortunate event . 
  or are you trying to say they had it coming ? 
  what about those 38 who died in the fire of the union house ? 
  a true hero city , right ? 
  it would seem that way . 
  also , some people probably do n't support either side of the conflict . 
  [ keith gessen 's diary from odessa ] ( http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/keith-gessen/diary ) might be helpful with providing an answer to you question . 
  thank you , i guess . 
  the pics were taken with an old canon which sells for $ 25 on ebay . 
  son , keep away from my daughters . 
  * goes to the shed to get a pitchfork * , 
  they probably counted on getting detained . 
  sweetest murderous little beasts in the world . 
  they are singing the national anthem of ukraine , then they chant ` glory to ukraine , glory to heroes ' etc. 
  meanwhile [ these folks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in1_vjlzpto#t=25 ) are allowed to participate in may day parades . 
  [ yep , that 's dear ol' un ] ( http://www.unwatch.org/cms.asp?id=5560086&amp;campaign_id=65378 ), 
  as a postscriptum : `` poh\u00e1dky z mechu a kaprad\u00ed '' was also brilliant . 
  sorry for being overenthusiastic and/or a bit of a nuisance . 
  no , the newer titles do n't ring the bell . 
  i feel disappointed in myself . 
   dunno what was shown elsewhere , when i watched it we were already independent [ ... ] oh , that explains it . 
  i used to watch those back in the commie days . 
  shit , i 'm old , and short of breath . 
  i need to sit down  still , krtek \u2665 forever . 
  czechoslovakian kid 's series were awesome . 
  were non-animated series like `` nikto nie je doma '' or `` arabela '' broadcast in yugoslavia ( i assume ) as well ? 
  it does . 
  [ here 's an answer given by a slovak ( close enough ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/18ou5l/whats_your_favourite_european_language/c8gnd7b ), 
  that , i do n't know . 
  but here 's a fun polish idiom for you : [ czeski film ] ( http://cs.wiktionary.org/wiki/czeski_film ) . 
  right , next you 'll be trying to tell us that superman is n't called extra p\u00e1nek in czech . 
  * soon * actually , it would be a real badge of honour . 
  maybe . 
  you are definitely on redwatch though , 
  it would end in a duel . 
  sorry , i meant a drinking contest filmed by john woo - instead of doves , you have shamrocks . 
  he 's probably a sleeper agent . 
  hurrr duuur . 
  personally , i 'd opt out for a lectica . 
  lavrov must be a formidable poker player . 
  you can thank the al-assad family for that . 
  it 's been a rather poor and authoritarian country for generations , plagued by ailing economy and corruption , repression of open political opposition , even resorting to massacres of civilians in the course of fighting an insurgency ( 1982 ) . 
  you do realize syria turned into a war zone only after assad 's brutal crackdown on protesters in 2011 ? 
  [ let me refresh your memory with this article . 
  ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/torture-of-boy-reinvigorates-syrias-protest-movement/2011/05/29/agpwireh_story.html ), 
  the moment of abduction was n't caught in this video - the green man in balaclava let him go at the very end and the guy went in the other direction through the crowd of aggressive * colorados * . 
  [ are pussy willow branches used in hungary as well ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=6hrg2whffm8#t=86 ), 
  it 's not available in poland either . 
  i do n't think we are missing that much , it 's [ only some ultras chanting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p1am-2ifqk ) . 
  google '' \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0445\u0443\u0439\u043b\u043e '' and limit the search results to ` past week ' or whatever it 's called in french . 
  also , it 's probably the uploading party who restricted the availability of the video , not your government . 
  he does n't need to - he 's got enough to eat at home ( his words ) . 
  agreed . 
  the most that happens is unashamed whoring to the electorate quickly followed by amnesia . 
  some politicians visit * common people * and listen attentively to their problems before elections , e.g. 
  quite embarrassing . 
  one can dream . 
  care to explain , frisiandude ? 
  i 'm not quite sure if i 'm suppose to thank you for the compliment or become extremely offended , conquer your island , and skull-fuck you as a proverbial cherry on top . 
  i 'll agree with you on the subject of snowden fanbois being misguided , not to say irritating . 
  and , quite frankly , the concept of * european superiority * is equally ridiculous . 
  people on the internet , arguing , eh ? 
  it 's annoying , i know . 
  [ shit people say on the internet  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/202f09/nato_is_to_deploy_reconnaissance_planes_in_poland/cfz7epf ) . 
  while * novorossiya * is a historical term for the region , the fact he actually used it is a bit puzzling , to say the least . 
  i know , i read the news . 
  also , that 's only one of recent developments . 
  if you 'd like to learn about russian capacity for mass surveillance , i suggest you read [ this article published in 2012 ] ( http://www.wired.com/2012/11/russia-surveillance/all/ ) , etc. 
  french secularism . 
   yep . 
  [ ... ] c'mon , do n't be * that * guy . 
  i 'm not trying to have an argument with you , read the link i provided , please . 
  that 's targeted surveillance , not mass surveillance . 
  you should probably give an example like [ sorm ] ( http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/fall2013/russia-surveillance ) . 
  probably something along the lines of king of bums or king bum ?
