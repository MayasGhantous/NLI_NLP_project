  mostly agreed . 
  although i can see some young people ( i.e. 
  under 35 ) in that crowd , the majority seem middle-aged , plus some are almost definitely pensioners . 
  which video ? 
  i meant op 's one . 
  the crowd in the one i linked seems mixed . 
  is that so ? 
  the crowd in the video * seems * to consist of mostly young people . 
  op 's video was uploaded on 12.04.14 , a day before the metro station incident . 
  i do n't think it 's that simple . 
  marches of comparable sizes demanding referendum were organized by the pro-russian part of the population . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-ggl3qquiq ) . 
  you should probably see [ this earlier thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/232eb6/extensive_results_of_gallup_public_opinion_survey/ ) as well . 
  [ is it the same guy ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av-qquhknpu ), 
  i think the bloke has a striped ribbon on his left arm which suggests the bench was an eu-sponsored fascist . 
  are you sure the victims were right sector members ? 
  some sources describe it as a vicious beating of pro-ukrainians by a mob of separatists . 
  i believe t-72s are supposed to be replaced with so-called direct support vehicles , leaving only leopards and pt-91s as our mbts . 
  i might be wrong though . 
  we [ bought some in december . 
  ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20131125/defreg01/311250019/poland-acquires-tanks-from-germany ) i guess we 'll need more , although 800 tanks might be excessive . 
  noone 's taking mr macierewicz seriously ? 
  i disagree . 
  a quarter of all voters believe his conspiracy theories and he even managed to become the vice-chairman of the largest opposition party . 
  shots fired . 
  yes , you are right . 
  wrong choice of words , i guess . 
  as if it only meant one thing in english . 
  * doje\u017cdza\u0107 * is quite close . 
  dirty dancing , anyone ? 
  no singular in polish either . 
  the plural form exists but it 's somewhat ~ ~ legalese ~ ~ formal . 
  it is n't , really . 
  i ca n't speak for europe but if it 's anything like my backwoods , most people consider them useless bellends . 
  i thought you were having a laugh until i googled it . 
   also it 's impossible for a building to be compared to hitler . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/bryonygordon/8416813/a-house-like-hitler-were-soon-feeling-semi-detached.html ), 
  it looks like one . 
  and it 's delicious . 
  check his user history . 
  you are quite wrong on this one . 
  have a look [ here ] ( http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cha_chapter43_rule154 ) . 
  there 's even a passage there with a quote from an italian military manual concerning a duty to refuse illegal orders . 
  an order to commit a crime is considered unlawful and as such must not be followed . 
  who needs a gaz tigr when you can get a [ kub rocket launcher ] ( http://wojsko.otomoto.pl/inny-wyrzutnia-rakiet-kub-na-gasienicach-t3382861.html ) ? 
  are you collaborating yet ? 
  it 's from his mugshot taken in 1902 . 
  it seems the blog has a number of contributors - david axe is the author of only two articles out of dozens displayed on the front page . 
  i thought it was a variation on a gimp suit . 
  it 's perfectly fine . 
  the only reason i asked the question was because i was curious . 
  in fact , it was i who probably came across as rude . 
  do n't worry , i 'm not a judgmental type - i 've been using res for about a month and it tells me i agree with you on some of the issues ( you are at +3 or so ) . 
  then again , i believe you should probably vote more responsibly . 
  do you vote for national front ? 
  i remember that . 
  however , if you want to prove anything , you should probably track the conversation you had with him and check if the comments are really missing . 
  it was probably [ craig and geoff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptny2dpftkq ) . 
  there 's nothing wrong with either of those flairs . 
  and ignore that cunting troll , please . 
  was n't that latvian minister sacked for his participation in the march ? 
  sorry to butt in on your conversation , but i guess you might be interested in [ this short article ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/24/ukrainian-women-kidnapped-by-russians-in-crimea-tell-their-tale.html ) . 
  i 'd advise against the first one - even if it 's only the telegraph reprint . 
  an unsuspecting visitor might click the main page link and find themselves in conspiratard central . 
  another lucrative investment opportunity in eastern poland ? 
  502 - it went through , 504 - try once more ? 
  it 's a somewhat derogatory term for a left-wing person frequently overused by polish right-wingers . 
  think * leftard * or * lefty * . 
  also , i strongly suggest you ignore xkenq , he 's a troll . 
  your numbers are spot on . 
  according to m. bilewicz ( center for research of prejudice , university of warsaw ) 46 % of poles believe jews murdered jesus and over 20 % believe christian blood is used in jewish rituals . 
  an offer they ca n't refuse ? 
   just random fun fact : 123 % ov sevastopolians [ ... ] turns out it was a mistake by some news agency . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20mn3b/its_not_146_but_close_123_of_sevastopol_residents/cg4scdr ), 
  are we listening to the same speech ? 
  it seems to me 5 billion is the total amount that has been given to ukraine for the purposes she mentioned since it regained independence in 1991 . 
  mateusz piskorski is an ex-mp with alleged connections to russian intelligence services and international eurasian movement . 
  i believe he even took part in propaganda visits to transnistria , libya , and syria . 
  the author is an american who also writes for press tv . 
  what a twist !, 
  c2 and central support structures constitute nearly 40 % of all ` active personnel ' ( as it 's shown on the graph ) . 
  it 's probably more than combat-ready troops . 
  also , it was the news outlet you sourced a lot in those `` what happened in your country this week '' threads . 
  simpson 's in the house . 
  again . 
  the numbers are definitely exaggerated . 
  [ according to andriy parubiy it 's 270 tanks and 80000 troops ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/parubiy-ukraine-now-faces-the-threat-of-a-full-scale-invasion-339133.html ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if it were a fraction of that . 
  i hope you realise the damage was done last year , snowden 's * fame * has been fading ever since . 
  while some of those european allies you complain about still have military personnel stuck in some god-forsaken fobs in afghanistan . 
  what would you like to happen ? 
  should some mythical figure silence a largely irrelevant committee because it suits your needs when faced with results of numerous failures of american foreign policy over the past few years ? 
  stop overreacting , please . 
  he was invited by the justice and civil liberties committee . 
  also , do you actually believe his testimony was of any importance ? 
  as far as i know , cooperation between the intelligence services of individual european states and their american counterparts has n't suffered as a result of his ` revelations ' . 
  obligations towards your nato allies and ukrainians who participated in your iraqi adventure ? 
  it 's right there in the first sentence : `` poland ** plans ** to have nuclear power from about 2025 [ ... ] '' .
