  it wo n't happen - there 's too much nimby about nuclear energy . 
  commerical polish nuclear plants ? 
  about as profitable - and real - as polish lunar colonies . 
  the guy in the graduates photo with the polish flag is n't polish . 
  i can tell because he 's not wearing white socks with his flip-flops . 
   all hair the soviet re-union peaceful expansion !, 
  [ yay !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_6zcevz7mo ), 
  you should probably link to [ paet 's webpage ] ( http://www.vm.ee/?q=node/51 ) instead of kremlin 's mouthpiece . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://maidantranslations.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/maidan-self-defense-leader-at-the-end-of-the-day-living-in-this-country-has-been-worth-it-because-weve-lived-to-see-the-maidan/ ) another interview with the guy published a few weeks ago ( at least i think it 's the same person ) . 
   i just want to correct the fact that 70 people died before the agreement . 
  they got killed in the hell that unleashed after they broke the agreement . 
  get your facts straight , please . 
  the agreement with the opposition was signed on february 21 , a day after the bloodiest day of the crackdown on the demonstrators . 
  [ check this timeline ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275 ) . 
  the situation has been ` stable ' in western ukraine for the past few days . 
  what do you propose , by the way ? 
  russians as a guarantee of fair elections ? 
  that would be a novelty . 
   [ ... ] have proper elections in west/east and then decide !, 
  the date has been set for 25 may 2014 . 
  russia seems to have a problem with that . 
   the ` pro-eu ' side did not respect its engagements twice now , initially the day before blood was shed then when yanukovitch 's car was shot at in a visible assassination attempt . 
  ok . you are definitely getting the chronology of the events wrong . 
  february 20 - the bloodiest day of the revolution while negotiations with eu foreign ministers are in progress . 
  february 21 - the agreement is signed , yanukovych leaves kyiv and his convoy is allegedly shot at on his way out . 
  feburary 22 - yanukovych is removed from office, 
  [ ok ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itxqdez1h4#t=29 ) . 
  on a more serious note , german public prosecutor 's office apparently cares and they will press charges against this muppet . 
  some reports stated it happened in ukromne . 
  which means they probably took a detour from sevastopol . 
  even polish pm agreed today that ` regardless of how inappropriate german customs officers or police had behaved , the behaviour of jacek protasiewicz was also inappropriate ' . 
  well , he is one . 
  i watched his press conference today and it was clear he was in the wrong . 
  i 'm glad german prosecution announced they would press charges . 
   do you know what the birth rate of islamists ( that 's what you should call them ) in germany is ? 
  around 8.0 where did you get those numbers from , if i may ask ? 
  i 'm not sure what fertility rates among ` islamists ' are but according to [ this report ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-europe/ ) by pew reasearch center , the fertility rate for german muslims is 1.8 ( 1.3 for non-muslims ) . 
  if by ` islamists ' you mean groups like salafists , i 've got news for you : their number is estimated at 4,500 according to german intelligence services who monitor their activities . 
  they 'd have to multiply by bipartition to become a dominant force in europe in the 21st century . 
  edit : corrected the fertility rate for non-muslims from 1.6 to 1.3, 
  if there 's evidence it reduces the appeal of smoking , i 'm all for it . 
  do n't know if it 's fascism but it 's definitely racist . 
  local reports i came across stated 35 of them had fled the base ( with weapons ) . 
  i think it 's the other way round . 
  some demographics are easily manipulated by rydzyk 's media . 
  at least i 've never heard about any particular group of voters influencing the policies of rm . 
  stop repeating that . 
  no more than 50.000 voters participated in the 2005 elections abroad . 
  it 's a negligible number when compared to 15 million votes cast within territory of poland . 
  they are quite conservative but if we are talking about total numbers , you might be overestimating their influence ( it 's only around 20 thousand registered voters or so ) . 
   no better way to turn russia to the western ways than some ** degenerate `` artists '' ** , right . 
  wow . 
  i 've heard a similar term before . 
   reddit user / u/vernazza bravely stared [ ... ] as he spent the entire day with his and his girlfriend 's family in a not-at-all uncomfortable manner . 
  according to kyiv post verkhovna rada is expected to vote on impeachment after 4pm . 
  you can find their updates [ here ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-feb-21-live-updates-337287.html ) . 
   protect from who ? 
  from cia-sponsored fascists , duh !, 
  it does seem that way . 
  however maidan 's civil council voted to mandate the opposition leaders to sign the agreement nonetheless - that gives hope to a peaceful resolution . 
  there are some caveats from svoboda as well , namely exclusion of zakharchenko and pshonka from the future government . 
  initial reports suggest curbing the presidential powers by amending the constitution in september , then elections in december . 
  i 'm skeptical about radicalised protesters accepting it . 
  no , he was jailed a couple of times for robberies and assaults . 
  it 's unclear but i suppose it might have been an effort to regain and/or expand the ground lost yesterday to security forces . 
   [ ... ] will weigh heavily on their minds for the rest of their lives . 
  i hope they will end up before a court , together with their commanders . 
   i bet you think if everyone just talked it out we could all love each other forever huh . 
  you forgot to mention sitting in a circle and singing kumbaya . 
  sorry , i simply can not . 
  taking a life of another human being is such a horrifying concept i genuinely feel sick . 
   so you 're suggesting that these guys are out there thinking `` oh yes . 
  now we get to kill some people ! '', 
  if they are anything like security apparatus in communist poland 30 years ago , some of them are probably psychopaths ( just like our zomo were ) . 
  i seriously can not believe anyone can even entertain the idea of trying to justify those stone-cold killers . 
  some videos floating around show special police forces shooting protesters in cold blood , from a safe distance . 
  that can not be justified by fear . 
  some possible actions are suggested [ here ] ( http://helpeuromaidan.info/ ), 
  they were probably expecting rubber bullets , not live ammunition . 
  i 'm not sure if we mean the same event but the arms depot is located in lviv and is currently sealed / guarded by protesters . 
   how the fuck does the government think they are going to get away with shooting their own people ? 
  how can anyone even carry out such orders ? 
  i 've always believed uniformed services had a duty to refuse unlawful orders . 
  they probably call it `` anti-terrorist '' operations ? 
  sorry , you are full of shit . 
  even rt writes in the article :  he said there were ** unidentified ** snipers firing from buildings all around independence square . 
  [ this is horrible ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dxkdiacsf8 ) . 
  imagine the shitstorm from our conservative mps ( like beata kempa et al. ), 
  if it does . 
  the deadline is set for the end of november . 
  there 's hope . 
  they will be easily weeded out ( no pun intended ) by their pesel numbers , i suppose . 
  if it fails , it 's no big deal . 
  there will be other initiatives . 
  it takes time to change laws , but the times , they are a-changin ' . 
  i hope . 
  i 'm afraid the numbers will decrease soon . 
  wolne konopie is not exactly a popular movement and some - if not most - casual marijuana users will simply dismisss any eu-oriented initiatives . 
  i 'd love to be wrong on this one .
