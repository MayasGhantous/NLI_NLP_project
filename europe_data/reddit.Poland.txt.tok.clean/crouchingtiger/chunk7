  and that ` t ' stands for ukrainian trident !, 
  sorry , could n't resist . 
  savannajeff has been on reddit for ages . 
  he 's controversial at times - usually because of his pro-multicultural attitudes . 
  seriously , look through his comment history . 
   edit : reading your comments , it 's clear you 're just ukrainian nationalist . 
  [ ... ] i know you 've got an axe to grind with him since he basically called you an idiot earlier on but do you realize you went a bit bonkers there ? 
  look deeper through his comment history : he 's probably an australian who studied and lived in poland and sweden among other countries . 
  the initiative is promoted by wolne konopie ( facebook , their spokesperson 's blog [ here ] ( http://maciejkowalski.natemat.pl/ ) , etc. ), 
  and the number will probably increase . 
  dozens of police officers sustained gunshot wounds . 
  that 's video footage from bangkok , thailand . 
  most victims are civilians but [ one policeman has been shot dead as well ] ( http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/article/983852?annid=983853&amp;timestamp=1392737712000&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter ) . 
  it 's at least seven according to the beeb . 
  i think it 's about bypassing existing laws and regulations , i.e. 
  access to such data can only granted by a court . 
  edit : according to the article '' [ ... ] it was able to collect the ip addresses of visitors in real time , ** as well as the search terms that visitors used to reach the site from search engines like google ** '' . 
  the latter is definitely beyond simple monitoring of ip addresses accessing a website . 
  i know . 
  i meant the fact you mentioned zakopane specifically instead of the general region of podhale . 
  nevermind . 
   [ ... ] poor , uneducated mountaineers from zakopane . 
  while i agree such a stereotype exists , being that specific might make the rest of the conversation a bit awkward . 
  `` rz\u0105d sam si\u0119 wy\u017cywi '' ( ** the government will manage to feed itself ** ) . 
  rather infamous words of the regime 's spokesman , jerzy urban , in response to us sanctions against communist poland . 
  our speed skaters are a bit disappointed - [ 3 guys are sharing a single studio flat ] ( http://www.polskatimes.pl/artykul/3319768,soczi-2014-polscy-panczenisci-rozczarowani-zakwaterowaniem-wracamy-do-czasow-juniorskich,id,t.html ) . 
  [ oh lord , bless these manhole covers !, 
  the planes were holograms !, 
  the visit is also linked to the boost in military purchases planned for next few years . 
  i 'm still hopeful about a peaceful resolution . 
  we 'll find out soon enough , i guess . 
  [ the opposition have given yanukovych a 24-hour ultimatum ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25853329 ) . 
  according to radio svoboda the body of yuri verbitsky ( one of the kidnapped activists ) was discovered in a forest near kyiv . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25238996.html ), 
  i suppose a stun grenade would cause a serious hand injury without any additional shrapnel attached to it . 
  was he trying to pick it up or was it simply an unfortunate accident ? 
  i read on their [ webpage/forums ] ( http://sundayassembly.com/ ) they used upbeat music , think `` celebration '' by kool and the gang , etc. 
  also , birgitte nyborg 's boyfriend was hospitalized after an antibiotic-contaminated pork dinner . 
  no , the joke has been said so many times it 's simply boring now . 
  see the recent [ joke life preserve ] discussion . 
  also , irrelevant to the subject being discussed . 
  if you look at the data it seems they mixed-up prk with rok . 
  did you see north korea at no . 
  something 's not quite right there . 
  it 's certainly a pity but i doubt she cared about awards and recognition that much . 
  he 's an important figure - or even better , a symbol of solidarity movement , unfortunately his lack of humility and occasional bouts of bigotry might disqualify him from being ' a hero ' to some of my compatriots . 
  interesting . 
  i heard baumgartner was n't a crystal-clear character either . 
  then again , it might be just rumours . 
   in terms of living heroes , maybe felix baumgartner ? 
  would n't niki lauda be a better choice ? 
  i live in a small town ( population under 100.000 ) and bedsits in a reasonable location start from 900pln . 
  you can find a cheaper one but you 'd live surrounded by dodgy characters in a cockroach-infested tower-block . 
  i 'm not talking about `` partying '' but normal life . 
  $ 500 is barely enough for necessities . 
   for $ 500/month you can live a normal life here , save something each month . 
  ymmv . 
  depends on your definition of * normal life * . 
  also , $ 125/mo for a bedsit ? 
  only $ 30/mo for bills ? 
  agreed . 
  i find it neither particularly offensive nor terribly clever . 
  i bet someone will find it controversial though . 
  remember `` science : it 's a girl thing '' or `` growing together '' ? 
  slight ? 
  it 's quite * in-your-face * . 
  i think you might be on to something there . 
  [ after a bit of googling i managed to find some secret footage of their colombian connection . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a834cwznhi ), 
  same thing happened in spain a few years ago - the amount was slightly smaller and the shipment was found at lidl , not aldi . 
  no , a large number of firearms , allegedly even assault rifles . 
  no , do n't . 
  `` paleolibertarian '' sounds like a diet . 
  wait , would n't you rather call yourself a thatcherite than a libertarian ? 
   and i 'm not from krak\u00f3w . 
  not even close . 
  good for you , pollution-wise . 
  also , there 's only one thing i hate more than cracovians , and that 's varsovians  just kidding . 
  but seriously , why would [ you even consider voting for rn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ue29f/have_you_decided_which_party_youll_vote_for_or_if/ceh8gyc ) . ? 
  they are ultimate cock-wombles when it comes to politics . 
  he 's simply confused . 
  i doubt it . 
  he 's probably a conservative from krak\u00f3w . 
   in germany at least pirates and afd should be in there , if not more . 
  i think the pool is limited to current meps . 
  i try to vote for candidates , not according to party lines . 
  the mep i voted for in the previous elections is a member of a party i would never vote for in national elections - it just happens she 's best qualified for the job and has sensible views on the subjects i care about . 
  i 'll probably vote for her again in may . 
  apparently it 's from [ september 1930 ] ( http://blog.modernmechanix.com/north-sea-drainage-project-to-increase-area-of-europe/ ) issue of modern mechanics magazine . 
  i 'd bet on media hype . 
  svoboda is the smallest of opposition parties and their popularity is limited to west ukraine . 
  apis p\u00f3\u0142torak should n't really be on the list - it 's a mead ( 16 % ) . 
  also , [ this . 
  absolutely . 
  and since 5 years is a really long time in offensive cyber security , the current catalogue would probably be jaw-dropping . 
  if anyone wants to read the specifics , [ they can be found in the presentation published here ] ( http://leaksource.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/nsas-ant-division-catalog-of-exploits-for-nearly-every-major-software-hardware-firmware/ ) . 
  some of them are implemented by installation of hardware or software * implants * during delivery of the equipment ( `` interdiction '' ) , a couple of them can also be installed remotely onto a compromised system . 
  also , neat spy cables . 
  i 'd love to see an up-to-date version of the document . 
  is that more to your liking ?
