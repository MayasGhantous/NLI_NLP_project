  there should be an image of a steaming turd next to the headline when linking to that website . 
  it was definitely facepalm worthy . 
  in a sad way . 
  i think i might actually remember the incident you mentioned . 
  was it was the discussion about that german tv series `` unsere m\u00fctter , unsere v\u00e4ter '' ? 
  no , ichbinsisyphos is ok ... for an austrian .

  agreed . 
  although some of those exploits might not be widely available - nsa buys them from private researchers like vupen ( a french company ) and others .

  just saying . 
  [ try this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pnkmfxaabi ), 
  bbc use quotation marks in the headlines all the time . 
  i suppose it serves to indicate other news sources . 
  look at the most popular section : 5 headlines out of 10 use quotation marks . 
  the article is simply terrible . 
  they are sensationalizing a fact that a security agency keeps a vulnerability/exploits database . 
  is n't it what you 'd actually expect from them ? 
  why ? 
  because nsa keeps a list of hardware-specific exploits for penetration purposes with no complicity from the manufacturers ?

  there 's only that much you can do with a korean . 
  a roast is n't one of them . 
  never had them . 
  they look skinny too . 
  what 's the marbling like ? 
  is it the diet that makes the taste and texture ? 
  why wo n't you marinate your korean overnight and make a stew out of him/her ?

  [ here 's an example of two countries where abortion is illegal and the dominant religion is roman catholicism , yet fertility rates are quite different .

  a lengthy sentence in any western prison is preferable to torture and death in a syrian jail . 
  happy festivus to you as well !, 
  you are a lot of fun , seriously , a gift that keeps on giving  i do n't see how it could justify `` almost any kind of punishment '' . 
  i think you are taking it a bit too far . 
  even if stopping the next generation of jihadis * by example * seems to you a bit medieval . 
  edit : added '' [ of jihadis ] '', 
  sure . 
  still , if a threat of losing one 's citizenship stops even one individual from blowing up human beings in a foreign country ... 
  no , but it might stop some types who embark on the jihad boat thinking they can simply go back to their comfortable lives any time they want . 
  if you only arrested the returnees , it would n't be much of a deterrent , would it ? 
  then again i also doubt deterrents can even prove successful in these cases . 
  i found it a bit disquieting as well . 
  although the scenario you described seems quite unlikely in this day and age , some review would certainly put my conscience to rest . 
  even it if lead to lengthy judicial proceedings . 
  i think it might be considered a deterrent measure , i.e. 
  if you leave for a jihad holiday , these are the consequences . 
   mrs may has targeted 20 ** dual-nationals ** this year using `` deprivation of citizenship orders '',

  it 's a bit absurd that equality is dependent on which side of a state line you live in . 
  sure it probably made more sense then . 
  nowadays state rights lead to absurd situations where e.g. 
  gay marriage is legal in one state and illegal in another . 
  a senator supported by 200.000 constituents carries the same clout as a senator with 10x as many ? 
  it seems grossly unfair . 
  i suppose the compromise does n't work any more . 
  i know . 
  still , seems quite unfair . 
  imagine that each of those states has the same number of senators more populous states do . 
  it 's hilarious .
