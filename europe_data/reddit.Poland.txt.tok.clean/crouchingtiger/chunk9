  apparently the title of the show is `` biss och kajs '' - there are some low-quality bits of it on youtube . 
  seems like someone was also busy in odessa last night -  http://www.ktv.odessa.ua/09-12-2013/v-odesse-razbili-pamyatnik-leninu/n19590/, 
  that 's quite an epic quest . 
  that makes me feel conflicted as well . 
  also , i hate the fact they disregarded applicable health and safety regulations - dismantling monuments should be performed by appropriately trained personnel only . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i 'm not a fan of wanton destruction of public property but this time around i 'd give them a pass . 
  i think so . 
  unless i was hallucinating . 
  the footage was grainy but a bit later i also read a caption saying something like `` pomnika lenina povoleno '', 
  lenin 's monument has just been toppled . 
  wow . 
   what did the famous poet say before he committed suicide ? 
  `` comrades , do n't shoot ! '', 
  that 's a joke about vague circumstances of mayakovsky 's death , right ? 
  ded moroz is awesome like that !, 
  while i would n't call it * rioting * , some minor scuffles can be seen in [ this video ] ( http://www.reuters.com/video/2013/11/24/ukraine-opposition-protesters-riot-polic?videoid=274664470 ) . 
  he 'd need a second pair of arms for that . 
  i thought he moved to us while working for transmeta . 
  he 's been a us citizen since 2010 ( moved there at the end of 90s or so ) . 
  some celebrate it in a rather strange manner , e.g. 
  [ nop invited nick griffin to give a speech in krak\u00f3w ] ( http://www.krakowpost.com/article/7244 ) . 
  wtf ? 
  they probably should . 
  btw , the video is also missing from aljazeera america website . 
  it 's always 20 years away . 
  i 'm old enough to remember that . 
  sorry for butting in . 
  relax and have a laugh at those miserable sods . 
  [ here 's some comedic gold coverage from one of the right-wing tv stations . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cbofeo1y74 ) seriously , ca n't remember when i laughed that hard . 
  a perfect summary of the sheer idiocy of the event can be found [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxik7f0jvo ), 
  [ john kerry ate a piece of a baguette ] ( http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/secretary-of-state-john-kerry-eats-a-piece-of-a-baguette-he-news-photo/186948389 ), 
   also the same ship probably ( i do n't know how sure is this ) has a history of drug trafficking and frequent name changes . 
  you can see the name changes [ here ] ( http://new.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/667735000 ) , vessel particulars section . 
  why did you even do that ? 
  is n't emigration a better option ? 
  i left my homeland for this very reason ( well over 20 years ago ) and was only able to return once the military forgot about my existence . 
  [ training is fine with me , and here 's a song for you ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfakuz0uls4 ), 
  it 's just a hyperbole . 
  nothing that serious would happen except for a dramatic rise in unemployment , probably comparable with the levels found in spain or portugal . 
  i checked it out of curiosity as well . 
  [ i think you can see their logo in a video here ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/10/31/hungary-s-magyar-hajnal-assert-far-right-identity-against-others/ ) - i mean the symbol on the back of the jackets . 
  also , strange video gaydar-wise . 
  lower silesia , poland - just like my flair says . 
  traditional bulgarian folk music . 
  sorry , i did n't follow it closely and thought the replacement of pcc with a more effective entity might actually improve the accuracy of news and curb some excessive practices on the side of tabloids . 
  is n't it what it 's aimed at ? 
  would you mind elaborating ? 
  are you talking about the use of super-injunctions or the new press regulations ? 
  on the other hand , some granite blocks are still waiting for collection . 
  poland : possession of any quantity is illegal and carries a sentence of up to 3 years , although the sentence is usually suspended for first time offenders . 
  prosecution can decide not to follow your case if the quantity is small , however they almost always do . 
  distribution carries a sentence of up to 10 years , depending on the quantity . 
  consumption is n't illegal . 
  not really a smoker ( i have a few puffs every few months or so ) but i fully support decriminalization . 
  as to legalization - probably . 
  since the state already profits from sales of alcohol , it could just as well tax the sales of less harmful marijuana and use the additional income . 
  ] ( http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14811.aspx ), 
  same in german . 
  nowy s\u0105cz at no . 
  6 is even more surprising . 
  it 's neither large , nor heavily industrial . 
  if i 'm not mistaken the approvals are granted on a case by case basis . 
  lake charles was conditionally approved in august . 
  since his/her nick is islingtondevil , it could just as well be some neighbourhood in that borough , let 's say finsbury park . 
  was it ? 
  i thought it was forbrydelsen iii ( the name of the company was zealand iirc ) . 
  why not link to the page of the original project instead ? 
  the name is right there on the map and the project itself looks cool : [ `` blitzortung.org '' is a community of station operators who transmit their data to the central server , programmers who develop and/or implement algorithms for the location or visualization of sferic positions , and people who assist anyway to keep the system running . 
  there is no restriction on membership . 
  all people who keep the network in operation are volunteers . 
  there is no fee and no contract . 
  he 's even mentioned in the second stanza of the polish national anthem . 
   russian embassy in libya is evacuated after attack of locals provoked by killing of libyan military officer by russian female powerlifter ; the link seems to be wrong . 
  unless the powerlifter was a soup-stealing bear , of course . 
   hit by labour disputes and strikes in germany , us online giant amazon is considering five new logistics centres in the czech republic and poland , a polish economic daily reported on monday . 
  [ a part of the original article in polish ] ( http://www.pb.pl/3347485,50790,amazon-zatrudni-6000-polakow ) , the rest is behind a paywall . 
  it 's simply rather dangerous due to temporary loss of vision . 
  [ you can watch a very informative video on the subject here . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtksdy2kaw4 ), 
  looks like warnijskie ( kormoran brewery ) . 
   a couple of deadly shootings in gothenburg .

  is johan falk involved in the investigation ? 
  [ peaceful union protests in the capital ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1me5lz/thousands_protest_against_polish_government/ ) ? 
  the only one i can think of is fiat plant in tychy ( close to 1500 layoffs in the first quarter of the year , some of the workers have been reemployed since then ) . 
  [ here 's a bit more on the background of the op-ed , as well as on putin 's hypocrisy ] ( http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/vladimir-putins-complicated-history-op-ed-columnist/ ),

  one of the companies is accused of exporting pork originating from an unapproved spanish slaughterhouse .
