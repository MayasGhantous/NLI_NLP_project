  it 's not that the usd is strong , it 's the fact that , well , 1 `` california dollar '' always equals 1 `` mississippi dollar '' - and 1 `` greek euro '' always equals 1 `` german euro '' . 
  between , say , poland , and the czech republic , if the czechs started exporting more , the price of the koruna relative to the z\u0142oty would go up and make polish stuff more competitive , thus working as a safety valve . 
  if we both had the euro , this valve would n't exist , which is part of what 's going on between the competitive economies of north europe and the weaker south . 
  as for your question , if cali companies sell a lot to other states ( i assume they do , but i do n't know that for sure ) , then it works the same way , however , the job market in the states is way more unified than here , so it 's easier to move from mississippi or , say , cleveland oh , if their economies are n't doing too well , to some place that 's economically vibrant . 
  not so easy here despite eu 's efforts , not to mention the people are n't so keen on that either . 
  also , the us federal budget is way bigger than the eu budget compared to the respective economies , and your exemplary mississippi is , i think , the largest net receiver of these funds ( cali being one of the largest net contributors ) . 
  arkhangelsk seems nice . 
  hot but bearable 14c at the moment , cozy -15 c on average during the winter . 
  cognates are similar words with similar meanings . 
  like english apple and german apfel . 
  then do n't discuss it , and keep telling to yourself the other party just produces stupid slogans while doing the same exact thing . 
  if there were a consensus we would n't be discussing this , and the issue is inherently philosophical . 
  science can tell you when a new genetic code is assembled , different from parents . 
  it ca n't tell you when to consider it a person . 
  you misunderstood me , the argument is n't about whether or not we should kill people , it 's about what constitutes a person . 
  [ there are different oppinions about it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beginning_of_human_personhood#biological_markers ) . 
  to me , it 's a human being when the higher brain functions appear , and before that , it 's just a clump of cells . 
  plenty of people more clever than you or i share that opinion and , of course , the same goes for what i assume to be is yours : that it 's a human from conception . 
  this is also relevant when discussing , say , whether it 's a moral thing to do to unplug someone with brain death from the equipment that 's keeping them alive . 
  point being , your mass of posts about how we ( the people who think abortion should be legal ) want to kill humans , is a ridiculous strawman . 
  we have different opinions about what is a human being . 
   nobody says that , but `` aborting '' people becouse of poverty is just barbaric . 
  it would be , but then again , this is n't about aborting people , it 's about aborting few days or weeks at most old fetuses . 
  that 's not people . 
  unlikely . 
  it will stabilize though , watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftzneizrklg ) . 
  his other stuff in the sidebar is also interesting . 
  i do n't know , it seems dangerous socialists are stopping the free market . 
  god damn you germany , why are you so cool . 
  it 's a public channel , is n't it ? 
  ard + zdf cooperation ? 
  yeah , or when you can play starcraft and learn about defeating zerg rushes . 
  the fyromese should take south fyrom from greece . 
  poland is a post-communist country . 
  post-soviet countries are the ones which were part of the ussr . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
  actually , that definition says he 's not , as it specifically says it 's about the post-soviet countries , and for a reason . 
  that reason is , although he 's as close as it gets to this status in poland , he 's still nowhere near the amount of money , influence and power akhmetov , prokhorov , or their ilk acquired . 
  that 's what people think when they hear this word . 
  take a look at those links , compare them with richest poles [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_poles_by_net_worth ) . 
  actually , lower silesia has the highest mountain ( \u015anie\u017cka ) . 
  the real reason is the river oder , its upper part =  upper silesia , middle part =  lower silesia . 
   sikorski was also sugessting to `` help '' a one oligarch with his investmens in ukraine 1 . 
  kulczyk is * not * an oligarch . 
  poland 's rich people are a far cry from actual oligarchs in countries like ukraine or russia . 
  according to wprost 's ranking , his worth , together with wife , is around $ 4 billion ( 11.6 billion pln as of 2012 ) . 
  solorz was second at 8.5 billion , then two more and no other `` oligarch '' had more than a billion dollars . 
  now read these lists about [ ukraine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_richest_people_of_ukraine ) , [ russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_russian_people_by_net_worth ) , and , hell , the [ czech republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_czechs_by_net_worth ) . 
  poland 's economy is , roughly , 40 % the size of russian , 250 % the size of czech , and used to be like 5 times the size of ukrainian , before the meltdown . 
  we have plenty of problems , but dangerous oligarchs are not one of them . 
  the polish `` oligarchs '' are dwarves compared to these people . 
  government helping native business grow and expand is a good thing . 
  ukraine was dressed too provocatively . 
  boy is everyone stupid but you ( and the french dude ) , eh ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  do you think someone can be convinced to become gay if they were n't gay beforehand ? 
  i 'm a straight man , i get grossed out by man on man sex , and i 'm pretty sure no amount of `` promoting their orientation '' can change my mind about that . 
  if you think you could be persuaded that sucking cock is something you want to do then , well , you * might * not be as masculine and heterosexual as you think . 
  and that 's fine , it gets better . 
  eh did afraid of fear itself . 
  there 's also a bunch more cities named like that : izmir , izmit , iznik , isparta . 
  yes . 
  that was after 2 years of pis government . 
   they feel betrayed that komorowski sentenced their children to death are you a wizard ? 
  that 's the enlightenment, 
  it 's not an assumption it 's a joke . 
  well , the second part is , i consider polityka to be mainstream media . 
  almost like obama . 
  how is polityka not mainstream media ? 
  also , does this mean he 's evil because dangerous leftists like him ? 
  why singapore ? 
  that 's the russian modus operandi re : ukraine . 
  tell the left wing they 're defending the world from dangerous fascists . 
  thell the right wing they 're defending ukraine from dangerous gay people . 
  does n't sound particularly socialdemocratic . 
  i think we agree , actually . 
  gandhi was obviously important , but without britain there would be no case to be made at all . 
  they had something , and they kept it , thanks to him , among others . 
  * looks at flair * no . 
  was schr\u00f6der the one who implemented this ? 
  i 'm no expert on india , but from afar it does n't seem much more or much less diverse than europe . 
  india 's unity was however forced upon it by an outside force . 
  do you think india would have united - kerala to kashmir to assam - without it ? 
  [ well ... ] ( http://ljplus.ru/img4/y/a/yarowrath/national-bolshevism.jpg ), 
  what does it mean in swedish ? 
  i was reading his leaflets and listnenig to his supporters and they all used the uk as an example , so it 'd just be fptp . 
  if it was a system like in germany , i 'd support it . 
  there are such people , and quite a bit of them . 
  yes , when i read red square i immediately think of buryatia or wherever chita is . 
  there was a `` check how polish you are '' test there . 
  said i forgot how to polish . 
  sounds alde-ish to me . 
  it was the only thing i found in english . 
  if you have something better , i 'd be happy to edit the op and add it . 
  why would he pretend to believe that shit ? 
  it 's not like it 's gon na make him win . 
  polish politics was always shit . 
  also , i was just joking . 
  why choose the lesser evil ? 
  america , until bachmann is in a psych ward you do n't get to laugh at us .
