  if it 's a * w * at the end of the word , it does turn into an * f * . 
  however , if there is another word after it , then depending on its beginning that effect may or may not take place . 
  if there 's a vocalized consonant like * b , d , dz , d\u017a , g * , and a bunch of others , then the * w * in wroc\u0142aw remains vocalized instead of turning into an unvocalized * f * . 
  vowels may have a similar effect in certain dialects . 
  this kind of phonetic assimilation takes place for all consonants in polish , including the ones in the middle of words . 
  the final consonant in a cluster decides if the whole cluster is vocalized or not , except if * rz * or * w * are in play - these also get unvocalized if preceded by an unvocalized consonant ( like in * potrzeba * , which is read * potsheba * ), 
  i honestly was n't familiar with this , and googled vatnic instead of cyrillics because i 'm dumb . 
  oh come on , explain it , now i 'm curious . 
  shall i hand you a tissue or did you wipe it in your underwear ? 
  he 's medvedev 's lost brother . 
  i wonder . 
  how did you come to this universe ? 
  can i use your technology to find myself one where grrm will finish his stuff before a heart attack gets him ? 
  fascinating . 
  sikorski , if he got the job , was supposed to befome foreign affairs dude . 
  i guess he 's too hawkish for some countries . 
  now that tusk gets to be commission boss guy , someone else will be foreign affairs dude . 
  leftist , * noun * - 1 ) someone who is not randroid scum 2 ) someone who does n't think russkie photon torpedoes killed kaczynski 3 ) someone who does n't wear a 70 zl piece of cotton with witold pilecki or nsz . 
  it is estimated that around 99.5 % of poland 's adult population is leftist according to one of the definitions . 
  nothing serious , there were some listed on wikipedia . 
  basically , the support for nato membership doubled since maidan . 
  i checked some polls . 
  this is a symbol of how crushing a defeat this whole situation is for russia . 
  turkey joined nato before they invaded cyprus . 
  that depends on what exactly do they cede . 
  here , read [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/2eao2u/isis_the_army_of_a_suicidal_generation_with_no/ ), 
  it 's still right-wing . 
  it 's just not batshit crazy . 
  well , ukraine 's integration with the west would mean a lot of bad things for putin 's regime , both in terms of the geopolitical game , and ideas a successful , westernized ukraine might give the russians . 
  also , i do n't think you realize just how rich that country could be , potentially . 
  yes it 's a mess now , troubled by corruption and demographic collapse not to mention a war , but as a place it 's very rich . 
  it has what it takes to become an agricultural and industrial powerhouse . 
  i do n't pretend we 're saints and russophobia does n't exist or is new . 
  in fact , i 'd say that was to be expected after communism . 
  the politicians who are most russophobic also happen to be the ones i despise most ( well , used to , now it 's korwin but not because of his stance on russia ) , and i recall myself criticizing them for their shit on numerous occasions . 
  the point of my post was n't that we 're saints , we 're not - but that russia does play a game , the play is as i described , and the aim of it is to be in a position of power in relations with eastern europe . 
  it too started long before the ukrainian conflict , by the way . 
  as you say , it 's geopolitics . 
  basically , i 'm not sure if we even disagree . 
  a bit late to the party , but oh well . 
  one would need to be completely divorced from reality to still consider this an internal ukrainian issue of `` fascist banderites '' / `` cia-backed junta '' fighting the pro-russian insurgents . 
  such people do exist , on both the left and the right , of course . 
  this situation is a direct continuation of putin 's policy regarding eastern europe , through different means . 
  the aim of this policy ( which is perhaps itself a means to a greater end , personally i think it is but that 's debatable ) , is to make western europe abandon eastern europe to russia . 
  or , more precisely , to allow russia to talk to individual countires / do things to them individually , where it has an advantage over every single country , rather then to a block where it is at a disadvantage . 
  how to do this ? 
  paint eastern europe as unreasonable russophobes . 
  paint them as nazi supporters - not just in ukraine , but also the baltics . 
  give powerful countries , who would be in position to help ( germany , italy ) good deals on gas , while giving weaker ones worse deals . 
  build underwater pipelines of dubious economic viability to transport gas to the west while circumventing countries like ukraine ( so they are not an issue when it comes to supplying the west with russian gas ) . 
  also put former leaders of said western nations in charge of the pipelines . 
  it seems this has worked . 
  putin can invade a neighboring country and as long as he does n't kill a puppy in front of tv cameras or whatever the western leaders and societies are perfectly happy to play along . 
  their reaction so far has been limited to harsh language and some insignificant sanctions . 
  if you ask me , he could do the same with , say , estonia and get away with it too . 
  he 's saying they will lose and `` the west '' will not help them . 
   so he wo n't suffer from overextension and so he can integrate the cores easier . 
  this is not europa universalis . 
  the real reason why he should do that is : ukraine will never give up on this place , and until it does its path to nato and the eu will be blocked . 
  a mafia-run quasi state that stops ukraine from functioning like a normal country . 
  federalization of ukraine would create ( a single big one ? 
  a bunch of small ones ? 
  an autonomy for donbass and that 's it ? ), 
  an area in the east and possibly south of the country under effective russian control . 
  it would turn into a super-transnistria the moment moscow found that useful . 
  it 'd be a defeat for kiev , they 'd have to choose between these areas and their relations with the eu . 
  east germany used to have an * amazing * one . 
  other than that - france , hands down . 
  palpatine did nothing wrong . 
  also the number of jedi deaths is being exaggerated . 
  actually , you ca n't . 
  it 's northwest of kiev , not northeast . 
  * slowclap *, 
  have the brits drop daleks on raqqa . 
  it wo n't be war , it will be pest control . 
  on a more serious note , they certainly should n't be allowed back into europe without any problems . 
  if there 's a double citizenship they should lose the european one ( and taste life in the countries their parents/grandparents left ) . 
  if not , well , their governments should do what they should do for any member of a terrorist organization . 
  also : mohammad and ibrahim are the only muslim names on that list ( at least i could n't find another one , then again i do have a bad hangover so maybe there 's more ) . 
  one might have thought that news about the mythical non-crazy imam existing would be universally considered good . 
  of course , thank you . 
  i found it on wikipedia and it agrees with what i know , so i posted it . 
  perhaps it does overemphasize the amount of germans here , but i do n't think the difference is significant enough to change the overall picture . 
  basically i did n't know who made this ( looks like that period though ) , but i still think he did n't need to lie . 
  it was more than just that . 
  [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/germanhamletssince15th.jpg ) 's a map showing [ german settlement in lesser poland and galicia . 
  ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c5%82uchoniemcy ) key , as much as my rusty high school german allows : * squares and circles are towns founded in 13th and 14th centuries , respectively . 
  * square/circle type 1 : numerous sources indicate over 90 % german names until 1500 . 
  * type 2 : strong majority of german names until 1450 * type 3 : less german names , but still a majority until 1400 * type 4 : sources are missing or inconclusive , but other criteria indicate that the germans used to play an important role there . 
  * type 5 : no known german presence * orange coloring : prevalence of the waldhufendorf ( \u0142a\u0144cuch\u00f3wka ) , a form of village originating in germany . 
  not shown in the lands of halicz and lublin . 
  * dots : german villages , brand new or founded next to pre-existing polish ones . 
  i hope it 's an acceptable translation . 
  did n't know that , useful info . 
  not with this one because eating 100 apples a day is gon na give you the shits . 
  not just the regular kebab shits , the mother of all diarrheas . 
  that is awesome , and i did not know that . 
  thanks . 
  amazing . 
  it 's fog !,
