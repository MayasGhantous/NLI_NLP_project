  no , he 's talking about a pidgin language used for communication in the mediterranean . 
  it was neither french nor the language of the original franks . 
  it was called `` lingua franca '' ( or sabir ) , and that 's the reason why a languages used by multiple populations are now sometimes called that . 
  yes , i 'm aware of all that , that 's why i said not removing him might have been a mistake . 
  1 ) one of my favourite countries . 
  i want to go to rize or arhavi next summer . 
  2 ) nice people , rich culture . 
  fezzes are cool . 
  yelkenler bicilecek is the best mehter march . 
  the food is * glorious * . 
  nuri bilge ceylan makes good movies . 
  ottoman empire was badass . 
  3 ) i always supported it , but now is not a good time . 
  also , i do n't think turkey needs the eu . 
  4 ) erdogan 's a danger . 
  few years back , i thought the army should n't remove him , because he won and was supported by a majority , and they ca n't just coup religious conservatives forever . 
  now i think it might have been a mistake . 
  5 ) one of history 's greatest men . 
  not flawless , nobody is , but a great man still . 
  they did n't make that assumption . 
  between the 1939 invasion , katy\u0144 , operation `` burza '' * and the establishment of a puppet government in lublin , it was unreasonable to make it . 
  they also knew the western allies would n't help them . 
  ^ * when ^ the ^ soviets ^ reached ^ pre-war ^ polish ^ territory , ^ polish ^ resistance ^ cooperated ^ with ^ them , ^ helping ^ to ^ liberate ^ some ^ cities . 
  ^ once ^ the ^ germans ^ were ^ gone , ^ the ^ soviets ^ would ^ disarm ^ and ^ imprison ^ them , ^ sometimes ^ by ^ force ^ if ^ they ^ resisted , ^ there ^ were ^ casualties, 
  it cost like 20 cents . 
  i said that i used some 0.10 coins , not that it only cost one , point being that people use those here , so there 's no need to remove them from circulation . 
  i did n't say they 're worth a lot , just that people use them . 
  here , nobody ever bothers with the smallest coins but people do use the 0.10 z\u0142oty pieces quite often , for public transport tickets or small items from convenience stores / vending machines ( case in point : i bought an attack wafer , product of slovakia , earlier today using some ) . 
  they 're roughly equivalent to $ 0.02 , so , at least here , these coins would have a point . 
  i assume it 's similar to lithuania . 
  because with eastern european pays and prices they 're non-negligible . 
  well , i 'm not sure about lithuania , but that 's the case here . 
  it should n't be wildly different there . 
  brb packing bag . 
  there would be a commercial break , and after it bruce willis would be chased by terrorists trying to get the vaccine . 
  confusing preu\u00dfens gloria by the original piefke with the most franz josef march there is ? 
  tsk tsk, 
  all of turkey used to belong to the byzantine empire . 
  rule britannia should totally be the anthem . 
  it could maybe , just maybe , compete with yours , or the russian one . 
  oh , i 'm afraid you overestimate the polish readers . 
  [ yes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/down_syndrome#name ), 
   they could have chosen a river . 
  they did choose a river . 
  the border runs along the river oder and its tributary , the neisse . 
  actually , there are two rivers called neisse in the area , it was first assumed the eastern one would be the border ( which would leave left bank breslau in german hands ) , but stalin changed it to the western one . 
  why ? 
  for one , it made his empire bigger , he did n't know if there was going to be a ddr . 
  additionally , as seen in both world wars and even before , russia is too big and too flat to stop an invading force reasonably quickly , without abandoning western cities . 
  [ take a look at this map . ] ( http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/images/2010/dec/polish-funnel.jpg ) . 
  there is a corridor of plains between the baltic sea in the north , and the sudettes and carpathians in the south . 
  the shortest line between the two , more or less ( they did use two rivers flowing there , so it 's not an exact straight line ) is the modern polish - german border . 
  it was n't a new idea , the russians toyed withthe idea during wwi . 
  as for the rest of your post , there 's nothing there the average pole would n't know , it 's not a secret . 
  people here just do n't talk about it all that much because , well , it does n't entirely fit in the black and white narrative . 
  why does mona lisa carry a ridiculously huge dildo ? 
  [ have an upvote . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/slow_clap_citizen_kane.gif ), 
  it 's quite often mentioned here . 
  well , at least when relevant , so in schools , and publications about the war . 
  the word 's `` ethnic cleansing '' are never used though . 
  at least i do n't recall them being used . 
  neither . 
  we got it because stalin was n't sure what was going to happen with germany after the war ( neutral ? 
  communist ? 
  split ? 
  morgenthaued into oblivion ? 
  ) , which meant that it was resonable to operate under the assumption that poland 's western border was going to be his empire 's western border aswell . 
  note how it 's the shortest ( thus the most defensible ) line between the mountains in the south , and the sea in the north . 
  had he anticipated a `` two state solution '' , the border would have looked differently . 
  also , it seemed that germany would * never * accept this , so poland will have no choice but to be a nice puppet and keep close to the ussr . 
  we have homeopathy courses at universities . 
  dawkins is too nice . 
  unfortunately , the perfect choice for the task is dead . 
  hard to pick , i like all of them . 
  i guess germany . 
  how does that matter ? 
   and yes , there are interesting data for germany speaking ethnicities . 
  it 's not a pandora box , it 's the reality that many poles fail to address , indeed . 
  you mean the reality that western and northern parts of modern poland were all german before the war ? 
  you seem to think it 's some sort of deep , dark secret which dastardly poles are trying to bury . 
  that 's not the case . 
  values for prussia and a-h are correct , but not for russia : there is no polish belt visible between hrodna and daugavpils . 
  that depends . 
  if the guardian depicted president bush as a simian because he 's white , therefore something between a human and an ape , then it was racist . 
  i think it 's quite safe to assume they did not , which is why nobody cares . 
  here , if the authors of this poster just meant that obama likes bananas because they are a good source of manganese which ukraine produces , then they are just misunderstood ( though they should have expected they 'd be misunderstood ) . 
  it is , however , also quite safe to assume that they just mean that he likes bananas because he 's black and therefore a monkey . 
  in other words , are you for real ? 
  it 's because of your location at the mouth of the rhine . 
  this means two things : dutch ports are the default ports for the entire rhine watershed , and rhine 's alluvial soils can sustain a large population . 
  that would be because russia is the aggressor in moldova . 
  aje always seemed to me a decent news source on things like that , because they have a ton of correspondents but no horse in this race . 
  they are biased on things like israel vs palestine . 
  i said earlier in the thread who i 'd see as a king . 
  then you guys can kick tayyip and we 'll have a personal union . 
  i 'm fine with poland being a monarchy as long as we are ruled by the house of osman and everybody gets a free fez . 
  fezzes are cool . 
  because nobody cares about ukraine and russia is a valuable trade partner . 
  he does n't , and he 's not a scientist himself , so he has to trust someone .
