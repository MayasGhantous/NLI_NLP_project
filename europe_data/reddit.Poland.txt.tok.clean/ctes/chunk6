  i 'm keeping this . 
  what fine protectors glorious white master race has . 
  at least the brits might be willing to lock these shitstains up . 
   i do n't view him as hostile to the united states . 
  he 's not hostile to the us , he 's friendly . 
  short explanation about the `` alliance '' : in recent history poland pretty much constantly supports america as much as its limited resources allow . 
  some examples : we sent men to iraq ( only the uk , australia and poland were with you during the initial invasion ) , we allowed cia torture facilities to be created on our soil , we bought f-16s instead of grippens or mirages when all our neighbors went with one of the latter two ( i assume they had real reasons , our decision was clearly political ) . 
  now , ( some ) poles kind of hoped to be rewarded for their support , with things like contracts in iraq or technology transfer via the f-16 offset package but , to make a long story short , america is basically unwilling to do what they expected , or incapable . 
  so the only real effect of all of this is some people here who think we can fling shit all over our neighbors because we blew uncle sam . 
  we ca n't . 
  america is far away , and our most important ally is actually germany . 
  fun fact , in 2004 , before the eu referendum , some people from our far right party lpr seriously argued we should join nafta instead . 
  i should have kept the leaflet . 
   global warming ... 
  i do n't think you understand what you 're talking about ... 
  it does n't , but it shows that you 're full of shit . 
  just like the other guy , by the way . 
  not sure . 
  you certainly do . 
  fascinating . 
  one of which is 2 years in erm ii , and joining erm ii is not obligatory . 
  which means , any country can postpone joining as long as they want . 
  high valyrian . 
  has just as many speakers as `` modern indoeuropean '' , but is actually cool . 
  yes , i know . 
  it was n't fully operational until few years ago . 
  ukrainian wikipedia says the cargo and passenger port was finished in 2009 , and the oil terminal in 2006 . 
  it 's a small landlocked country . 
  it has no natural resources to speak of , other than fertile soil perhaps . 
  it 's not particularly interesting as a tourist destination . 
  the little industry it has is in transnistria , an unrecognized open air museum of communism / mafia state . 
  also , abusive neighbor russia ( which is responsible for moldova 's existence in the first place ) , and no neighboring powerful , modern economy moldova could attach to like the baltics did with scandinavia , or poland with germany . 
  i 'm not a german at all . 
  i do n't even own leather pants . 
  underdog . 
  unless it 's one of the teams i root for ( poland , germany , turkey ) . 
  do you seriously think it 's a conspiracy to hide kwa\u015bniewski 's little dirty secrets ? 
  did you watch the relevant part of the video ? 
  my favourite mehter song . 
  kazimierz iii , because despite almost doubling the country 's land area , he is mostly known for economic buildup . 
  be careful not to gaze into abyss for too long ... 
  reality has a liberal bias . 
  also , op is a redditor since this afternoon , and there seems to be a lot of downvotes on posts that are not xenophobic . 
   such is the case in most of the world outside of western europe and the americas , which contain < 30 % of world population . 
  sorry to nitpick , but it 's actually more like 15 % , maybe 10 % . 
  which means what you said is even more important . 
  can you seriously not see the difference ? 
  pis is n't really anti-eu . 
  well , you do sound like one of these wackos in that post , even if you have a point . 
  no it 's not . 
  but , in a time of crisis people will start to get angry . 
  when there is no moderate option they may , depending on how angry they are , decide to go with the people who are n't afraid to get called far right racist nutjobs : the actual far right racist nutjobs . 
  so here we are . 
  i 'm not sure if he 's high , but using terms like `` fem-soviet government '' kind of hints that you might be . 
  they would n't get that much support in national elections : turnout is much higher and there 's only so many randroid neckbeards in this country . 
  yeah , one look at the comment section on any polish site and you want to claw your eyes out . 
  sanity . 
  ** poland now edited with results from 97 % commissions ** turnout : 22.8 % pis : 32,33 ~ ~ 31.8 % ~ ~ ( ecr ) po : 31.34 % ~ ~ 32.8 % ~ ~ ( epp , currently in power ) sld : 9.6 % ( pes ) psl : 7.21 % ~ ~ 7.0 % ~ ~ ( epp ) knp : 7.06 % ~ ~ 7.2 % ~ ~ europa plus : 3.44 % nationalists : 1.4 % source : wyborcza.pl, 
  i know he was responsible for people 's deaths , and i do n't buy the threat of soviet invasion thing but come on , he was just a sickly old man at this point . 
  one of the happiest days this year ? 
  really ? 
  goddamn socialists !, 
  if you have a feasible way of fixing pensions , please do tell us . 
  just to remind , removing them would make the country explode and is therefore not feasible . 
  also you 're missing the point : junk contracts may very well be a positive thing , but they are not seen this way on the left , and an actual socialist government would likely try to do something about them . 
  calling po socialist for being to the left of milton friedman is a bit over the top . 
  [ well said . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/slow_clap_citizen_kane.gif ) have an upvote . 
  well , that settles it , we can go home now . 
  through a river and a lagoon . 
  in what terms is it one of the poorest regions ? 
  gdp seems to be average , unemploymens is higher than average but still not top . 
  yogurt . 
  that 's a great article . 
  i 'd add this : http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/world/europe/europes-far-right-looks-to-russia-as-a-guiding-force.html?_r=0 . 
  i 'm not sure if he was amazing or if it 's the language that makes his sound five times more badass . 
  they were better off than most of the region before wwii . 
  after it they were * not * in the warsaw pact , or comecon , yugoslavia was in the non-aligned movement . 
  when yugoslavia was faling apart , slovenia was its richest part , and avoided a war . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/slovenia/gdp-per-capita-ppp here . 
  choose 1990-now , and compare with any other postcommunist state . 
  that is actually brilliant . 
  they gerrymandered districts . 
  this reminds me of a certain potato-shaped caudillo wannabe here , who wanted a `` budapest in warsaw '', 
  i see . 
  thank you . 
  question : what is considered minority here ? 
  are illegal immigrants counted ? 
  how about third generation descendants of 60s and 70s migrants ? 
  that would depend on what do you mean by `` maintaining itself '' . 
  total eu budget is around $ 140 billion ( or was in 2011 , it was lowered recently iirc , but i did n't find new figures ) . 
  to put it in context , it 's the budget revenue of austria in 2012 ( austria 's expenses in 2012 : $ 149 billion ) . 
  of that budget around 6 % is administration , that 's some 8,5 billion euros . 
  half of that is salaries . 
  liberal and nazifascist are the same , do n't you know that ? 
  satan has a bigger cock then that . 
  it is . 
  and to affirmative action . 
  difference is , gender parity or affirmative action support weaker , disenfranchised groups , while numerus clausus supported the one that was dominant in the country ( the argument was that jews are overrepresented in poland 's universities ) . 
  you just do n't understand , do you ?
