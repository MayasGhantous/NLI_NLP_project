  one night they attacked my grandpa house and partitioned the farm . 
  hans killed 5 members of grandpa family . 
  ivan killed only one but ivan kidnapped another two and resettled into the swamp where one died . 
  two years later hans attacked ivan . 
  uncle from us helped the ivan and the ivan at the end beated hans . 
  but ivan stayed in my grandpa home for the next 50 years and announced as a head of family . 
  ivan treated the whole family badly and had strange ideas about farming and do not let my grandpa work by his own . 
  grandpa several times was trying intruder to leave but it did not work . 
  whole farm was ruined . 
  comparing to other farms in the village , house of my grandpa looked very bad . 
  finally ivan left the house . 
  sometimes he drops in to my grandpa house and is trying to hear how my grandpa is greatful . 
  i am polish , and i became curious about your statement :  no , they were liberating the ukrainians and belorussians too from pseudofascist that joke aka the polish republic . 
  before 39 ukrainians and belarusians lived both in iirp and ussr . 
  that 's why i asked for an explanation where , according to you , this population lived better and where lived worse . 
  and whether the word ` liberation ' used by you is used in the right context . 
  do not take it offensive , i am just curious . 
  please also explain what do you mean writing : ` jews were segregated ' , ` ukrainians were discriminated ' ? 
  could you give some examples ? 
  could i ask what is your nationality ? 
   they received a nation you mean kind of independence ? 
  could you please compare what was difference for ukrainians living in the ii rp and in the ussr before wwii ? 
   only significantly less shitty . 
  are you trying compare ii rp and ussr ? 
  in which criterion ? 
  amount of victims ? 
  ukrainian was ` liberated ' by ussr communist paradise responsible for example for [ holodomor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) ( 3 -- 3.5 million victims ) , kgb and gulags system . 
  thank you . 
  hope our politics will never do that . 
   introduced tax from loss have you got any materials about it ? 
   chrysanthemum flowers are used in the same way in poland - are associated with funerals and cemeteries , and it is also faux pas . 
  the ` all saints ' day ' ( 1st november ) is in poland a day off from work . 
  the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives . 
  all cementeries light the night sky - it looks awesome - especially in a countryside without city lights . 
   they called themselves '' \u0163igani '' in poland we used to call them ` cyganie ' which sounds like '' \u0163igani '' . 
  but due to political correctness it is not used officially . 
  instead we use romowie . 
  there is polish proverb :  boys are born . 
  it will be a war . 
  next step is to let turk germans to vote in turkey elections . 
  if i would buy a property in greece , which taxes and how much i have to pay ? 
  who kill jfk ? 
  they formed together with the poles , lithuanians and ukrainians rzeczpospolit\u0105 . 
  i met some belarusians - they all were nice and kind people . 
  greetings from poland !, 
  a nation that often and successfully fought for independence . 
  very good cuisine . 
  famous wine . 
  invented holography . 
  they have a great contribution to the development of science - 16 nobel prizes in a nation with such a small population is impressive . 
  they are trying to become independent and to repay debt to the international monetary fund . 
  greetings from poland . 
  they look very skinny - maybe it is because of war . 
  or we are just much more fatter nowadays . 
  where are you from ? 
   there are still those among us , admittedly very few , who think that germans placed their death camps in occupied poland for some reason other than transportation . 
  there are still those among us , admittedly very few , who think that ii ww was about jews . 
  and all their monopoly for suffering . 
  maybe your granpa is too young to remember \u0428\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a . 
  - edit - maybe i 'm too old to remember all the stuff . 
  maybe it is all belong to you - next generations . 
  fight now . 
  be gently . 
  anyway , without tanks you are welkomed , 
  tomorrow ? 
  kurwa is just the beginning . 
  if you exceed this thin line - you can expect of great reward . 
  try . 
  imho - beauty is not so important for men . 
  but maybe i 'm wrong . 
  you can always look at the ddr swimmers women ( ? 
  we like every single russians very much - come here - we can drink a lot , talk a lot , sing a lot - but we do not like all the stuff concerning the ` matushka rossia ' and all the crappy siblings like judeobolshewics ones . 
  hmfcalltheway means ` democratically ' - not under the soviet occupation . 
  maybe this is a good move , because i heard a rumor that most traffic fines in the uk were issued for polish man named ` prawo jazdy ' , which literally means ` driving licence ' in polish . 
  if you like kayaking and sleeping in tents , i will recomend you ` internationale kanu `` brodnica lake district - drweca - weichsel '' ' . 
  many years ago i took part in it at it was awsome . 
  beautiful lakes and rivers , all the stuff was driven on trucks from one stop point to another , international and friendly people . 
  here is the [ website ] ( http://ktw.chelmno.com.pl/2012/53-miedzynarodowy-splyw-kajakowy-drweca-wisla/ ) . 
  you can translate it at the upper right corner of the website . 
  [ here ] ( http://ktw.chelmno.com.pl/gallery/index.php?sfpg=mjaxmiblvfcgu3bsexcgrhj3zwnhifdpc2xhlyoqnte1mgvizdc1n2fmmtg5njfmzjc4ztjhowm2mja4otk ) you have pictures from previous canoeing . 
   i have never heard the term `` polish concentration camps '' said by a german . 
  i do not know english vocab for agruculture machnes , but hope this thing is called ` r\u0119bak ' in polish . 
  here you have links from the first page of google search : http://www.teknamotor.co.uk/index.php?tekna=mobil ( polish company ) http://allegro.pl/listing/listing.php?category=16696&amp;string=r%c4%99bak* ( e-bay like ) http://www.rolnicze24.pl/ogloszenia/rebak/index.html ( e-bay like but for agricultural machinery ) http://www.agriaffaires.pl/uzywany-sprzet/1/r%c4%99bak.html ( e-bay like but for second hand agricultural machinery ), 
  stadiums of hate . 
  for me it 's ernest rutherford . 
  there is the old polish joke from the communist era concerning the trade between poland and ussr : `` we give them the coal and they in return take from us corn '' . 
  too much noisy and rude tourists there . 
  you are comparing absolute numbers . 
  i am convinced that the greatest number of arrested in the criterion of nationality is among the native britons . 
  you should divide the number of individuals arrested by the population . 
  poland here . 
  from history i know that we were part of commonwealth ( i do not know how you find it today ... ) . 
  during the last days of ussr it was great to see that you had created your own country . 
  some years ago i red the book titled ` man who crossed the street ' ( something like that ) wrote by the latvian author , and i liked it very much . 
  i do not know any latvian personally and we have no stereotypes about you . 
  at the beginning i was sure that you were talking about 17 september 1939 . 
  after checking - it was about 1944 campaign . 
  it is better . 
  our national day during communist time was 22 july - at that day in 1944 the ussr puppet , provisional government of poland exercised control over polish territory . 
  it seems that belarus did not cut off their communists time .
