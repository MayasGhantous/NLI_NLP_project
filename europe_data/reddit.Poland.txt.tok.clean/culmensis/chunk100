   and schnitzel !, 
  please - do n't forget that you left us not so far ago . 
  hope german tribes would not buy you by thier schnitzel . 
  just search the google for [ kotlet schabowy ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=kotlety+schabowe&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) and remember - we have our own heritage  . 
  so - what are the lessons that come from learning history like this ? 
  never , never help , do not fight and do not die for austria . 
  not worth it . 
   still harder than france . 
  a bit strange reference level for the term ` resistance ' imho . 
  the / u/crustedlamb is probably a troll . 
  he could also insert pictures of [ frederick william ii of prussia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_william_ii_of_prussia ) , [ catherine the great ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catherine_the_great ) , [ francis ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_ii,_holy_roman_emperor ) or just socialists like stalin or hitler 's . 
  he choosed only one - hitler 's . 
  we survived . 
  we exists . 
  thank god . 
  and i hope we will . 
  what is your point ? 
   are you gon na tell me situation of press in poland is anything but a joke ? 
  why do you think so ? 
   seriously ? 
  persecution of jews under communist regimes ? 
  no - that romkowski and r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski tortured and ordered the murder of any jew . 
  we are talking here about romkowski and r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski . 
  do you have any information that that they tortured and ordered the murder of any jews ? 
   that the presumably non-jewish individuals have been demoted from `` main character '' status and do not warrant further inquiry ? 
  roman romkowski and j\u00f3zef r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski were colonels . 
  the rest were lieutenants . 
  there is no articles on wiki about them - contrary to romkowski and r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski . 
   he uses a jewish phrase . 
  this phrase sounds very natural to me . 
  in my opinion , it can be used in other languages too . 
  i did not know you had a monopoly for using it . 
   as if these jews did n't torture and order the murder of other jews wholesale all sources i know says that - both romkowski aka gr\u00fcnspan and r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski aka goldberg - tortured and ordered the murder of poles . 
  if you have any reliable sources that they tortured and ordered the murder of any jews - please give it . 
  song about him ( in polish ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0igqoltqlu, 
  looking at the article from wiki :  on 8 may 1947 , he was arrested by the ministry of public security . 
  [ 10 ] prior to trial , he was repeatedly tortured . 
  the investigation of pilecki 's activities was supervised by colonel ** roman romkowski ** . 
  he was interrogated by col. ** j\u00f3zef r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski ** , and lieutenants s. \u0141yszkowski , w. krawczy\u0144ski , j. kroszel , t. s\u0142owianek , eugeniusz chimczak and s. alaborski -- men who were especially infamous for their savagery . 
  but pilecki sought to protect other prisoners and revealed no sensitive information . 
  [ 10 ] let 's look at some main characters : [ roman romkowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_romkowski ) - born natan gr\u00fcnspan [ grinszpan ] - kikiel , [ 1 ] ( may 22 , 1907 -- july 1 , 1965 ) was a communist official of jewish background trained by comintern in moscow , [ 2 ] who changed his name and settled into warsaw after the soviet takeover , [ 3 ] and became second in command ( the deputy minister ) [ 1 ] in berman 's ministry of public security ( mbp ) during the late 1940s and early 1950s . 
  [ 1 ] along with several other high functionaries including dir . 
  julia brystiger and the chief supervisor of polish state security services , minister jakub berman from the politburo , romkowski came to symbolize communist terror in postwar poland . 
  [ 4 ] he was responsible for the work of departments : counter-espionage ( 1st ) , espionage ( 7th ) , security in the ppr -- pzpr ( 10th dept. 
  run by fejgin ) , and others . 
  [ 2 ] [ 5 ] [ j\u00f3zef r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_r%c3%b3%c5%bca%c5%84ski ) - j\u00f3zef r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski ( polish pronunciation : [ \u02c8juz\u025bf ru\u02c8\u0290a\u0272sk\u02b2i ] ; b. josek goldberg ; [ 1 ] warsaw , 13 july 1907 -- 21 august 1981 , warsaw ) was a communist in prewar second polish republic , member of the soviet nkvd and later , colonel of the stalinist ministry of public security of poland . 
  born into a jewish family in warsaw , [ 1 ] r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski became active in the communist party of poland before world war ii . 
  he joined nkvd following the soviet invasion of poland and after the war , adopting the name r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski , served as interrogator with the polish communist security apparatus ( urz\u0105d bezpiecze\u0144stwa ) . 
  r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski was personally involved in torturing and maiming dozens of opponents of the polish people 's republic ; including anti-communist activists , as well as other , more moderate communists , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and cursed soldiers . 
  he gained notoriety as one of the most brutal secret police interrogators in warsaw . 
  [ 1 ] r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski personally administered torture to witold pilecki , one of the most famous cursed soldiers and the only individual who willingly went to auschwitz camp .

  my company provides programs to various countries in the world - including germany . 
  it department in one of the larger companies in germany operates until ~ ~ 12.00 pm ~ ~ 12 noon on fridays . 
  is this the norm in germany ? 
   there seems to be no valid basis for claiming that people 's exercise of their rights can be said to be the pretext for what happened . 
  i agree . 
  he is the mayor of the town and he has a power to make such a decision . 
  and the only environment that can judge his decisions are the voters from his town and the rest of the people interested in the festival . 
   russia recognizes west jerusalem as the capital of israel ... 
  thank you for the important details . 
  so what was the reason or pretext , according to you , that the mayor of opole , member of opposition party , refused the cooperation with national tv and canceled the festival ? 
   few years before . 
  he is ( was ? ), 
  actually connected to patryk jaki , `` famous '' deputy minister of justice in present government - member of solidarna polska ( ziobro 's party , minor member of pis ' `` united right '' ) . 
  he is completely not known person . 
  he is famous now - because of his decission . 
  i do n't know if he is member of any party or he is ` connected ' or whom he suppors now . 
  i can only base on information from sources like [ wiki about him ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/arkadiusz_wi%c5%9bniewski_ ( samorz % c4 % 85dowiec \\ ) ) . 
  from the data that is written there , data that we can be sure : for sure he was a member of po . 
  that 's all . 
  and maybe he was or is ` connected ' to somebody . 
  more important is imho if his decision is pro or against currently governing party or current opposition ? 
  imho the question is rhetorical . 
  edit : fixed link . 
   but if the performers gave him the pretext to cancel it , do n't they share in the blame ? 
  artists can be vocal , have unambiguous views and even be histerical - that 's their privilege  they can decide about themselfs if they want to participate or to boycott . 
  but the real decision about canelling cooperation with our national broadcaster is not in their competence , i 'm afraid . 
  if i [ understand well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/positions_on_jerusalem ) there are only two countries that recognise jerusalem as the capital of israel : israel herself and russia ( from april 2017 ) . 
  the czech parliament move is probably the symbolic and has no real meaning . 
   if the stars of the festival are so shameful and pathetic , read again please - i was writing about former member of opposition party . 
  member that is now a mayor of opole . 
  the one that cancelled the festival . 
   how can it matter so much that their show was cancelled ? 
  thier show ? 
  it was just cancelled by one person - the mayor of opole . 
  and it was pathetic imho . 
   who notice , was supported by pis during last elections ) [ he was a member of po ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/arkadiusz_wi%c5%9bniewski_ ( samorz % c4 % 85dowiec \\ ) ) - the opposition to pis party , that lost last elections . 
  imho that is just sad that he canceled the festival . 
   what is sad about that ? 
  sad , according to me , is just that the festival , organized since 1963 , has been canceled for political reasons . 
  the festival has continued and united poles for many years . 
  from the time of communism , through the transformation , political turmoil to this day . 
  artists played and sang even in times of overt communist oppression . 
  it is sad that now some politically engaged stars have given a pretext to the mayor of opole , a former member of the opposition party , which lost the last election , to destroy the tradition . 
  for me , this is a manifestation of the opportunism , the sad affair and the destruction of a couple of decades of tradition . 
  shame that such a pathetic people hold such high positions . 
  that is what i meant .
