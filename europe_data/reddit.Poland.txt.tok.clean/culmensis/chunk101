  it is sad that politics has so much influence on art and artists . 
   allied with the nazis , but we ca n't really blame 'em , stalin was trying to invade do n't be pathetic france - you have your own colaborators . 
  a lot of them . 
  and you are more known of beeing colaboratours then any other country . 
  imho . 
   wrong . 
  please write here the rest :, 
  linux , nokia , some of the rfc documents and [ protocols ] ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#page-31 ) , but what is more important - the [ war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) . 
  respect from poland . 
   i think he meant the war against poland , as in it would have been germany + poland vs ussr exactly . 
  it 's the option that is discussed in the article . 
  we have no ` mar\u0161rutka ' word in polish , but our languages are simillar and imho the root of the word comes from german word ' [ marschroute ] ( https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/marszruta ) ' that exists in polish language . 
  and means just designated route . 
  it consist of two words : march and route . 
  the ` mar\u0161rutka ' could be a diminutive version of this word or a thing that do a march-route . 
  the only example of poland 's influence on germany . 
  eat it !, 
  ( literally - the season for ground cucumbers begins  ), 
  there is a [ hope ] ( http://img5.dmty.pl//uploads/201610/1476952249_qpei8g_600.jpg ) . 
   polish drivers will be replaced by cheaper ones we have some from ukraine and belarus . 
   it will happen to the polish drivers . 
  i 'm afraid that when the wages will rise in poland to the western levels , then we will have autonomous cars , 
  imho so works the free market . 
  competition with western companies has led to a massive industrial decline in eastern europe . 
  what we can compete with is the service sector and cheap labor . 
  i hope this will be even soon and our salaries will rise to the western level . 
  and so out of curiosity - what is the percentage of drivers from the philippines ? 
  i know about drivers from ukraine or belarus but i have never met any of the philippines . 
  the article is described as if it were a mass phenomenon . 
   well if poland had allied with the axis under j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski ( who hitler admired greatly ) maybe the war would n't have started , if poland had ceded pommerland and east prussia . 
  it could cause only a delay with the war . 
  cite from this article :  the famous historian golo mann wrote that from the observations of the last three centuries one can conclude that in the geopolitics of central europe there are only three repetitive scenarios : poland with russia against germany , germany and poland against russian or germany and russia against poland . 
  sorry , but there is no other option . 
  article is in polish , please use google translate . 
  it works well lastly . 
   it wo n't go well agree , but it could go less evil . 
  according to them . 
  it sounds like the first attempt to build the axis in xxi century . 
  there are some voices from polish historians , that we should join to axis in xx century and the consequences for poles could be better . 
   i get the impression from reddit comments that eastern poland is filled with nothing but poorly educated , extra catholic , jingoistic twats that hate people from the right , people from the left the sea from the north , and the mountains from the south . 
  could you please give a few examples that confirm your thesis ? 
  this article is at least not honest . 
   eurosceptic law and justice ( pis ) party such eurosceptic , that they signed the [ treaty of lisbon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lisbon )  that migrants could bring diseases and parasites to poland . 
  imho quarantine is not a [ bad idea ] ( https://i.stack.imgur.com/mniis.gif )  `` we have not opened europe for refugees -- ms merkel has . 
  and it is ms merkel and germany that have to bear the consequences , not poland , '' of course mr kaczynski is wrong . 
  he was just the one that opened the door to europe . 
  he and mr werner faymann from austria . 
  there were some racist attacks in uk last time for example . 
  in one of them a man was killed . 
  it seems that they are just lithuanised slavs , 
  r1a haplogroup is supposed to be considered as slavs . 
  so here you have the table with the highest number of this haplogourp : | country | frequencie | | :-| : - :| | poland | 57.5 | | belarus | 51 | | russia | 46 | | ukraine | 44 | | slovakia | 41.5 | | latvia | 40 | | lithuania | 38 | | slovenia | 38 | | mordvins ( mordovians ) | 36 | | czech republic | 34 | | estonia | 32 | | maris | 32 | | moldova | 30.5 | | chuvashs | 30 | | hungary | 29.5 | lithuania and latvia seems to be countries denying their heritage  edit : spelling . 
   lithuania , latvia and estonia were actually listed as north europe recently in some kind of official list ( i ca n't remember witch ) . 
  it 's very often loud demands from these countries - even here . 
   poland on the other hand - not so much . 
  we have no such a desire . 
  just cited article from sources . 
  some of us want to be considered as central and not eastern europe , but it 's imho mostly used as a joke . 
   `` lithuania , like neighboring countries latvia , estonia and poland , belong to the nordic countries seems like baltics countries wet dream , 
  there is [ nine million bicycles in holland ] ( https://youtu.be/ehqg6-dojvw ) . 
   jim carrey according to political correctness , it may be will smith . 
   country to develop further and faster . 
  my country is developing further and quite fast . 
  and how is your country ? 
   you just cant stand the fact , that someone does n't like the party you 're rooting for . 
  it may be a big surprise for you , but i 'm not a supporter of the party currently ruling in poland and did not vote for them . 
  did you make a list of politics that poles should vote for ? 
   omg how dare i am to mention ** saint polish politicians ** , the ** leaders of progress ** in eu . 
  they are ** so patriotic ** that they even sabotage each other i.e. 
  tusk to become president of the european council . 
  we have our political dinosaurs , but we ca n't beat poland even if we tried . 
  please re-examine previous posts , calm down and try to write something more valuable than a collection of emotional stereotypes . 
  thank you - i 'm not worried . 
  i 'm just surprised that such a stupid imho statement is written by a czech , that are supposed to be wise and pragmatic nation . 
   it would be great if they could elect better government in the next elections it 's funny that czech citizen criticis polish politicians imho . 
  i do n't want to judge your politicians like babish or current president . 
  i do n't want to talk about massive corrupt scandals in czechia . 
  i would not dare to suggest you who you should elect . 
  it would be quite rude imho . 
  but just curious - westerners can be fooled by propaganda , but you ? 
  why do you think current polish government , democratically elected is bad . 
  and for whom should we vote in next elections ? 
  please make a list of politicians that we should vote for according to you . 
  they like our [ prince polo ] ( https://www.waldfurter.de/item/images/771/5000x5000/771-olza-prince-polo-classic.jpg ) . 
  and they like it from a very long time . 
   wait , are you seriously implying ukrainians and poles are the same people ? 
  why do you think that we are not ? 
  seriously - why do you think so ? 
  we were one country not so long ago . 
  we have common history . 
  many heritages for both sides . 
  - so - why not ? 
   all were with valid polish work permits , i.e. 
  they had right to be here , but not right to work here . 
  it is difficult to fight if their stay is lawful . 
  you should probably increase the number of checks at factories and deport such people back to poland . 
   print it and hang it above your bed . 
  a little piece of history for your kids too . 
  for sure it was not biased but fully professional historian opinion , 
   warsaw mostly lies west of vistula .
