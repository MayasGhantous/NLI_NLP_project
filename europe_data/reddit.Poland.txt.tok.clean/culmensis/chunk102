  you are right . 
  but what is your point ? 
   anyways the discussion is pointless . 
  agree - please sober . 
   and let me add to that : the silesian uprisings were a secret operation of the polish army , they were run by gra\u017cy\u0144ski , a pole born near krakow . 
  you know why ? 
  because you poles were poor as dirt , could not read or write , dumb , had no industry , no infrastructure , nothing . 
  dmowski begged the french to make sure poland steals the upper silesian industry from germany . 
  otherwise poland would not survive . 
   back then you needed our coal , you dumb fucks . 
  you cheats , you polish thieves . 
  you promised us autonomy . 
  you deceived us , you ran our industry to the ground , you exploited us as if we were a third world colony and left silesia destitute , with dilapidated infrastructure , wrecked environment and economy . 
   and now that you ca n't steal from us any more you want to destroy us . 
   go fuck yourself you polish cunts . 
  germans warned people before the plebiscite that being back in poland only means one thing : poverty for us . 
  stupid insurgents , they dreamt of poland and got this shit . 
  let me make a copy of your message / u/robiekupe . 
  if you would like to remove it tommorow . 
   almost everyone in western poland is from 1939 eastern poland i 'm from the western part of vistula river . 
  i have graves of my ancestors from more than a hundred years ago - much older than 1939 . 
  wroc\u0142aw after the war was a pure tabula rasa . 
  he was settled by displaced persons from different parts of former poland . 
  this symbolizes the ` monument to an anonymous passerby ' . 
  in my opinion this monument is impressive . 
  it symbolizes the people who come to wroclaw , [ entered the passage ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/pomnik_anonimowego_przechodnia_we_wroc%c5%82awiu,_widok_z_boku.jpg ) and after leaving they become [ fully-fledged inhabitants ] ( http://go.wroclaw.pl/api/download/img-e29996fa2df7bd08738ad9b8ff53fcee/pomnik-anonimowego-przechodnia4-jpg.jpg ) . 
   the rest are jerks like yourself i think it 's all for today . 
  have a good night . 
   give it 20 years , a little more casual xenophobia among the host nation and it 's gon na be quite different . 
  you 're right - it can be dangerous . 
  in my opinion , there is a safety threshold when someone is treated as a gastarbaiter or as a national minority . 
  10 % is a lot . 
  these results concern one city and not the whole of poland - but it can be dangerous . 
  i hope , however , that the poles and ukrainians are sensible peoples and that there will be no hatred between our peoples in poland in the future . 
  i hope that the ukrainians will integrate and they will feel and become ~ ~ poles ~ ~ loyal citizens of poland . 
   enjoying our coal too ? 
  i 'm not sure if we should appreciate people because what they have few hundred meters down . 
  we affraid of your people . 
  your people are making riots . 
  they demands high earnings . 
  other part of poland have to pay for your high earnings . 
  and we are paying for the debts of your factories . 
  we are paying for your 13-th salaries , 14-th salaries and free coal for your people . 
  you have a monopoly for coal in poland . 
  people that would like to import coal from russia were arested . 
  they were arested to not make a competition with your factories . 
  what can we do for you more ? 
  coal miners in current fit are parasities - sorry . 
  do something with that . 
   history 101 poles love you - silesians - and appreciate all of your [ silesian uprisings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_uprisings ) . 
  you have always been loyal poles . 
  thank you for that , 
   the number must be closer to 80 % sources ? 
   no , it happened in slovenia . 
  you were talking about your personal experiences - this thread is about poland , and i thought it was connected with us . 
   listen to this \u010defur , they always act like they own the place . 
  it happened in poland ? 
  if so - the blond was not pole - we have no word like \u010defur . 
  by the way - what does it mean ? 
  and what is more important - what did you feel at that time ? 
  what emotions have you experienced ? 
  whad did you do to defend your mother ? 
  did you feel guilty ? 
   makeberlinslavishagain i have not been to berlin for a while , but i heard there is a mess in there . 
  anyway - we cleaned there , cleaning it now and maybe we will clean it finally in the future / s. 
   it can get irritating . 
  i speak from experience . 
  would you like to talk about it ? 
  exactly . 
  i live in western part of poland , i 'm quite old and i had many friends friends from my chidhood with surnames from ukraine - so - nothing new . 
  ( the names comes to my mind : melnik , denisiuk , chmy\u0142ko and probably more . ), 
  it is significant that this comment comes from a russian / s. 
  you should not draw meaningful conclusions from the comments on the internet . 
  according to me , ukrainians are liked in poland and comments do not reflect the real world . 
  for sure china made a big progress in short time . 
  there was a song from 2005 about ' [ nine-million bicycles in beijing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehqg6-dojvw ) ' . 
  and bicycle at that case was a synonime of poverty and not a synonime for careing for the environment . 
  it was a little bit more than 10 years ago . 
  very short time . 
  for that short time they improved they economy and now they want to make alternative way of suppling their goods to eu . 
  alternative for shipping goods by aeroplanes and ships . 
  it 's called silk road and everybody want to make money on that . 
  but it works even today . 
  we have trains in poland that comes from china . 
  the trains are loaded with their goods from china . 
  but they coming back empty . 
  i 'm not sure what would change after built of the silk road . 
  will we have some goods that we can sell in china after building faster trains connection ? 
  if so - why we do n't send them now ? 
  imho the main goal for the chinese is not to make a fast train connection with eu . 
  they just need resources that are located on the way from china to eu - from countries like kazakhstan , ukraine etc. 
  and they are using this ` idee fixe ' of ` silk road ' as an excuse to purchase them for low prices . 
   by dehumanizing old people during one of the parliamentary elections in poland was promoted the slogan ` hide grandmother id ' . 
  this promotion was supported by the same communities identified with ` young people educated in big cities ' . 
  according to me , abominable practices . 
   young , educated if journalists want to show someone in good light they use this term . 
  in poland is also popular : ` young , educated from big cities ' - it is now being compromised and used as a synonym for propaganda . 
   [ grandma ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be-det85uvu ) , stop following me to reddit, 
   you clearly meant indo-european . 
  if you like etymology - there is the proto-indo-european dictionary online : https://indo-european.info/dictionary-translator/ for sure it 's not a best source , but there is no words for ` winter ' or ` cold ' that sounds like ` zima ' there .
