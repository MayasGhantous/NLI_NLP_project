  so it 's probably younger than pie language root . 
   this is ludicrous . 
  as well as current situation imho . 
  what would be the best solution , according to you , to not make a monopoly , and spread the funds for ngos that really needs that in our countries ? 
  without criterion of beeing supporter of particular political views ? 
  it 's norvegian money and they can do what they want with that . 
  but they should know that there is a monopoly for redistributing their money . 
  monopoly lead by ngos owned by controversial multibilioner that lead his own policy and has a big influence in other countries even without norvegian funds . 
  imho it could be dangerous . 
   this is standard process . 
  in hungary the distributor is \u00d6kot\u00e1rs foundation . 
  standard for what ? 
  distributing money for ngos by only one choosen ngo ? 
  what is the criterion of choosing just one and giving it a monopoly for financing other ngos ? 
  imho monopolies are bad and should be deregulated . 
  soros by himself is quite [ controversial ] ( http://www.conservapedia.com/george_soros#criticism ) . 
  and [ here ] ( http://prawo.gazetaprawna.pl/artykuly/976467,george-soros-rzadzi-polskimi-organizacjami-pozarzadowymi.html ) you have an article in respected polish newspaper ` gazeta prawna ' about soros controling polish ngos controversies . 
  article is in polish , please use an online translator . 
  norwegian funds for ngos have been and are being transferred to the controversial [ batory foundation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_batory_foundation ) . 
  after that the batory foundation distribute it at its discretion to other organizations . 
  organizations that have not received funding want to change the monopoly of the batory foundation for receiving and redistributing the funds . 
  from wiki :  the stefan batory foundation is an independent polish non-government organization established by american financier and philanthropist , george soros [ ... ] .

   some will , otherwise they would n't have voted for macron . 
  others wo n't . 
  good answer . 
  if you remove the name marcon , then your statement would fit every country - from russia to usa and from suomi to bushman people . 
   neither that they do n't want to work . 
  i never said that . 
  by the way - do you think that such a liberal proposals would be accepted in france ? 
   it 's a conclusion i take from your comment . 
  no - in my opinion , the liberal and pro-market proposals of the new french president will not be popular in the traditional socialist society of france . 
   yeah , the french are so lazy ... do you really think so ? 
  imho it 's just yet an another stereotype . 
  you may be right that a lot of these burned cars will be made by direct political opponents . 
  but for me , the french society , regardless of political choices , is not ready to accept the free market , labor as value , wealth as a result of work . 
  what they want is getting ` free ' money from the government . 
  such a deja vu of communist ideology . 
  sounds like a ` make france great again ' slogan . 
  according to the new president of france it should be done by liberalizing the labor market and reduce corporate taxes and the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . 
  he could be right imho , but would the france society allow him to implement it - or it will be as usual : massive protests , strikes and burning cars ? 
   since joining the eu . 
  since end of communism ( 1989 ) . 
   why the government ( and presumably the voters ) are so angry ? 
  why do you assume it ? 
  the first 2 links are about cementary in milejczyce issue . 
  it was done by two children 10 years old boy and 9 years old girl . 
  in all cases , the cemeteries have been renovated . 
  i do not claim that such cases do not exist , but imho it 's hard to talk that they are ` get vandalized in poland on regular basis ' . 
  sources ? 
   it is not local if non local websites report about it ( like bbc ) i added this link : [ seven young men set fire to a homeless pole on the sch\u00f6nleinstra\u00dfe underground station in berlin . 
  their images were published . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5khrse/seven_young_men_set_fire_to_a_homeless_pole_on ) 4 months ago . 
  the source was german press . 
  it was removed with the reason ` removed - local crime ' . 
  so you could be right that it was the reason of removing . 
  crime occuring in a country , 2 . described only in a country newspapers - then it is the ` local news ' . 
  but there were also some articles in polish newspapers about this issue . 
  do you think , that i should in that case use the polish source as ` non-local website ' ? 
  and it would be allowed ? 
   funny that germans and russians can have such constructive ties with both keeping monuments and graves of the former enemy , while the balts and poles continue with mindless hate of their '' eternal enemy '' . 
  please do not be so manipulated . 
  perhaps your worldview is built on the basis of residual information . 
  however , if you would reach the sources yourself , you would definitely change your mind . 
  for poles , simple russian soldiers sacrificed their lives fighting fascism - but at the same time they brought another occupant on their bayonets . 
  despite this , we have respect for simple soviet soldiers . 
  an example from my city : in 2012 was renovation of the main market place . 
  the bodies of 21 soviet soldiers were found . 
  they were exhumed and buried with due respect in the city cemetery . 
  in the area where other soviet soldiers were previously buried . 
  the funeral ceremony was attended by representatives of the city authorities , embassies of belarus and the russian federation and chaplains of the polish army , including the orthodox . 
   you can differently judge that time , but we come to this that they were young boys who had to fight and fall here on foreign soil and we want to commemorate them , `` explains mariusz k\u0119dzierski , mayor of chelmno . 
  here is one of articles about it in polish : http://bydgoszcz.tvp.pl/8109132/w-chelmnie-pochowano-szczatki-zolnierzy-radzieckich and this is only one of polish cities . 
  and one example of exhumating . 
  you can find information about ` soviet cementaries ' in other part of poland you can find googling ` cmentarz zolnierzy radzieckich ' term . 
  in this example refugees are the attackers . 
  should we allow such a news or should it be treated as ` local new ' and be banned ? 
   in some way i admire how he managed to grow such cult following you mean ` he ' or ` she ' ? 
  how do you judge her , by the fact , that she invited the ` refugees ' , by breaking the law with cooperation of the austrian chancellor ? 
  is it something imporant for you ? 
   and this can see also between poland and belarus . 
  magic . 
  not at the same level like russian - belarus border . 
  or west - east division of ukraine , 
  there is a strong front on the border between belarus and russia ... 
  portugal and spain : jajajaja . 
   are you suggesting that we should n't hold a worker 's day because the ussr had gulags ? 
  what ?? 
  why did you draw such conclusions ? 
  now i see . 
  you are happy without drugs .

  this is a credible explanation . 
  thank you . 
   you can not claim it is the cause of the happiness . 
  no , but one can find other explanation :  the danes and presumably other rich european also ranked high in happiness reports, 
   for the record : this post should have been immediately visible , and did not get caught in the modqueue . 
  thank you for your time . 
  but it is not still visible in anonymous mode .
