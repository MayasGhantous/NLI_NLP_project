   why ? 
  because it 's just an easy explaining of this causation . 
  if you would like to make more reliable study - you should denied the drugs for danish population or make the same study for people on the same anti-depressant level of drag  . 
   it 's a personal vendetta against you thank you for the in-depth analysis of the problem . 
  and clearly justified conclusions . 
  but if you would like to write something clever - please - answer my questions . 
  thank you for response . 
  it would be interesting to research the possibiliteies that mods of reddit have to censor the discussion . 
   in russian , however , it 's rather ... clumsy . 
  well - it 's the original language , so it 's hard to accuse about bad translation ... -- i liked it like footage - just a description of what happend to the author .

  i ca n't see it in anonymous mode .

  or is it censored and seen only for me and mods ? 
   nobody reads anymore ; such a statements using big quantificators needs a prove . 
   the gulag archipelago is really poorly written . 
  why do you think so ? 
  would be interesting to check the correlation with the [ largest antidepressant drug users ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/countries-largest-antidepressant-drug-users-2016-2?ir=t ) .

   the new york times is n't a german company , though . 
  my point was that , if freedom of press index is reliable and thesis of / u/mowmifranek are true , then ** german ** newspapers would write about it . 
  that 's all . 
  if you have any other questions or suggestions , please let me know  . 
   the word ` propaganda ' comes to mind . 
  agree . 
  have you seen [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegjinn2v3i ) ? 
  if you see the [ freedom of press ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68gc4e/freedom_of_press_rmapporn ) website , german press is the best in eruope . 
  if your accusiation were true , i 'm sure the independend press in germany , with such a high score , would write about it . 
  i was born in communist poland . 
  at that time , we were learning about different german concentration camps located on the land conquered by the germans . 
  in all these camps , germans killed people in various ways - including prussian acid , hydrogen cyanide or zyklon-b ( the same substance in all cases ) . 
  when i was a kid - i remember trips to a museum in [ stutthoff contentration camp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stutthof_concentration_camp ) - a camp where people ( not only the jews ) were killed using zyklon-b . 
  i remember the exhibition with cans of this pesticide , i remember the list of the german kapo who threw the cans into the gas chamber , i remember the photograph of kapo , who were hanged for killing . 
  this camp was in the german territories before ww ii . 
  today 's narrative has changed - according to the ` latest research ' - only in poland there have been concentration capms , where mass murders occured . 
  such murders were not in german or other wise nations territories like - sztuthow , dachau , etc. 
  because the locals would not allowed that ... . 
  they were only in poland . 
  for me it 's a bit weird . 
  i just googled ` marcon site : reddit.com/r/europe' in last 24 hours and it had no results . 
  my bad i did not check directly the website . 
  sorry for that . 
   when people or news `` speak well or not at all '' about their country . 
  gazeta wyborcza works from 1989 . 
  imho they have the same goals from that time and have the same level of journalists . 
   `` speak well or not at all '' with such an attitude it 's hard to accuse them of this  imho . 
  but you did not answer my question - where are you from and if you have such an journalists and media in your country ? 
  thank you that we have such a newspaper like gazeta wyborcza in poland . 
  they are looking for every single one issue with poles abroad and than publish it in our local market . 
  thus we know about every single crime where poles were involved as perpetrator across the world . 
  do you have such a media and such high level of jouralism in your country too ? 
  for me there are two different issues :  today some countries are using the system to get tax money that should go to other countries for instance , this has to stop . 
  agree . 
  and imho the remedy is sales tax instead of income tax .

   few things are more important for french people than their social system and social rights , and i do n't think they will accept to give it up for the eu . 
  the eu is supposed to be a cooperation not a competition . 
  but maybe i 'm naive . 
  imho you are not naive . 
  you are just against federalisation pushed by germans . 
  i do n't like this idea too . 
  we do n't have to agree . 
  we can be independent nations that had respect for our customs and heritage . 
  imho the best for eu will be to remain in the shape sculpured by previous agreements . 
  independent countries ties with agreement of free trade , free movement etc. 
  what do you think ? 
   there were allegations that the party in power had tried to restrict freedom of the press , expression , and speech . 
  that is not truth . 
  on the other hand - there are some imho important footages on youtube about situation in france . 
  events that is important for people living in particular parts of france , and probably important for other citizens of france . 
  like for example this one : [ woman from calais , france speaks about the horrors of migrants ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rifrdfelo ) . 
  was it widely reported in main french media ? 
  if so - please give examples , if no - please write why not . 
  and please write if you think , that french press is free in criterion of freedom of the expression and speech . 
  unfortunately it is a consequence of not being a lonly island and participating in global market . 
  from polish pov - i remember time , when our national monopolist in telecomunication - telekomunikacja polska , was sold for france telecom in 2000 . 
  after selling the new owners did not rise earnings for average people . 
  polish government promised keeping monopoly for few next years . 
  french bought our best factories , not mentioning ability to build the super-markets or taking part of other part of polish economy . 
   i would rather the union reformed and followed polands geopolotical and social goals . 
  economically ...
