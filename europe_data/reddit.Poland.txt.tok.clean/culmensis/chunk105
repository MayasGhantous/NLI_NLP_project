  different story . 
  so what are the ` geopolotical and social goals ' - but without truisms , pathos etc. 
  - ( please do n't give examples of intriguing and vibrating multiculturalism based on clash of enclaves of different civilizations ) - what are the ` goals ' according to you ? 
   the later obviously . 
  agree . 
  thank you . 
   rules have to be enforced or you can just scratch those . 
  its has been and is one of the eu s deficits . 
  poland is only one example . 
  france and germany are others i 'm not sure - but are you trying to build a model-based narrative : poland does not respect the law and germany and france do ? 
  or , on the contrary - one can find in any of these countries cases of non-compliance ? 
   but you agree most poles themselves would sanction poland today . 
  poles from this sub ? 
  it may be truth . 
   stay home , whirlpool !, 
  by home , you mean : benton harbor in michigan ? 
   when poland gets up to speed then they 'll probably move to somewhere cheaper and so on . 
  one of a factory from automotive is just moved to bulgaria from my region . 
  it is sad that candidates are resentful of other countries . 
  the second round of presidential elections in france will take place on 7th may . 
   where is the `` interesting discussion '' ? 
  the term ` interesting ' is not unequivocal . 
  some are interested in politics , some in cooking and some in smelling of feet . 
  everyone likes what he likes . 
  according to me - as for the 40 minutes lasting post posted at midnight , the messages that appeard there are very intriguing and had potential . 
  do not you think so ? 
  previous article i published 1 hour ago , on the same subject from reuters.com that was removed from this sub by mods with excuse : ` removed-duplicate ' . 
  it lasted for 40 minutes , but it was quite interesting discussion in that . 
  you can see it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67yscv/french_wouldbe_president_macron_says_would_seek/, 
  google translate : emmanuel macron , winner of the first round of presidential elections in france , said in an interview with the daily voix du nord on thursday that if he becomes president he would be in favor of eu sanctions against poland , which `` violated all eu rules '' . 
  ( photo by toby melville / reuters ) macron spoke to the regional daily of northern france after wednesday 's meeting in amiens with striking workers at whirlpool , which will be shut down due to relocation to lodz . 
  `` within three months after i was elected president , poland will be decided , '' said macron . 
  `` we can not tolerate a country in which the differences in social costs ( paps ) in the european union are playing out and which violate all the union rules , '' said the politician . 
  as he writes `` voix du nord '' , macron wants the sanction decision to be taken in the summer . 
  retirement would not , however , deal with issues related to social dumping , explains the daily . 
  `` we can not have a europe where ... when we are dealing with a member state behaving like poland or hungary - in matters of university , knowledge , refugees , fundamental values - it is decided not to do anything . 
  `` continued macron . 
  `` i will not give up on any matter . 
  those who do not understand this do not know me , '' he stressed . 
  `` i want poland 's case to be looked at in a holistic way , and to put sanctions on issues of european union law and values , '' macron repeated . 
  macron was supposed to meet only with a factory union delegation on wednesday , whose workers are on strike monday . 
  the change of plans and meetings with employees forced him to visit unexpectedly marine le pen , the extreme right-wing candidate of the national front , who at noon appeared in the plant at noon . 
  le pen , in an interview with employees , promised that if he became president , he would not let go of jobs in france . 
  it seems like some kind of #goodchange for poland . 
  it is sad that candidates are resentful of other countries . 
  the second round of presidential elections in france will take place on 7th may . 
  comedy . 
  for sure it is worth seeing . 
   how about a pro-austrian sentiment instead ? 
  you know you love us  [ jeder schuss ein russ jeder sto\u00df ein franzos jeder tritt ein britt jeder klapps ein japs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbshh9ay2jc ) old good movie .

   noone expects the german wehrmacht . 
   half of the german army 's armored vehicles in mali have broken down because of the west african country 's dust and extreme heat sounds like a propaganda folder . 
  ` this is not working that is not working , the broomstick army ' , and then suddenly they need only 2 weeks to conquer half of poland .

  it just got a bit too much , the whole sub was being flooded . 
  sorry , this was n't tagged appropriately . 
  i 'm subscriber of numberphile on youtube . 
  as far as i remember some of the infinity calculations and cardinal numbers was presented there . 
  what impressed me most ( i had it during studies , but it was not so obvious ) is the central limit theorem engines available online ( for previous versions of webbrowsers supporting java ) or statistical curse from khan academy . 
  i like math . 
  i like the precision . 
  i like the generalizations . 
  i 'm not profesional mathematician . 
  i 'm aware that there is many of ` sentences ' that exists on the level of letters and are obvious for profesionalists ( like for example : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = c ^ 2 / s ) - they exist for them on the level of letters , patterns - and not on the level of idea . 
   am i missing something here ? 
  yes . 
  / u/smolkley wrote that : ** had ** not have, 
  exactly the same 2 responses from google that i used to talk with you before . 
  but seriously - would you expect from someone that knows the formal language of mathematic to gues what is p ( x ) in this context ? 
  imho - if one put a thesis one should describe all the factors , fields etc. 
   camouflaged very well camouflaged - ` even ' ( unfortunately - it 's the ultimate judge of our times ) google did not find any interesting about the \u2203 y \u2200 x ( x \u2208 y \u21d4 p ( x ) ) . 
  i expected that is a trap . 
  but ` naive set theory ' - it 's a hit below the waist , 
   \u2203 y \u2200 x ( x \u2208 y \u21d4 p ( x ) ) what do you mean by p ( x ) ? 
  imho it 's true for common sense theory . 
  therefore / s. 
   do n't fall for it , before you know it they 'll be stabbing birds ( or whatever the fuck poland 's national emblem is . ), 
  the emblem is the eagle - but you probably mean the [ white stork ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_stork ) . 
  i heard that syrians hunt for this bird - but in turkey also ? 
  if so - we have declining population of white storks unfortunatelly from recently in poland . 
  do you think it started when the erasmus program begun ? 
  is it a correlation or a causation ? 
  i do not see any controversy on this map . 
  are turks so polite in everyday life ? 
  so now you are the sami people ( also s\u00e1mi or saami , traditionally known in english as lapps or laplanders ) . 
  by the way - are they - sami people - considered as scandinavian or at least - nordic ? 
   yesterday crimea , today donbass , tomorrow odessa .

   since russia invaded ukraine , poland has been helping ukraine . 
  imho it was from the declaration of independence of ukraine in 1991 . 
  you are right . 
  that is sad . 
  for the first they were oppressed by nazis because they were jews . 
  then they comes to israel and were called by their [ israeli brothers as cowards - sabon or soap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soap_made_from_human_corpses ) - because of they attitude during holocaust .
