  they allow them to die in flats with mushrooms on the walls . 
  nobody is interested with this . 
  shame on you - israelites . 
  do something with that . 
   if there are italians i always end up with the question - ` how many words do you have in your language borrowed from italian heritage ' ? 
   but it 's still pretty grim considering factors from your link we are better only in the one :  be 50 % less likely to have hiv/aids . 
  not bad factor for me  from history - you had a reach influence in area of my town . 
  the people from netherlands - called in our region as oleander , some of them were [ mennonites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mennonite ) - they made some melioration in our area and we have some of their artifacts - like for example this [ house ] ( http://polskaniezwykla.pl/web/gallery/photo,16874.html ) . 
   what ireland used to be . 
  hope we will reach your gdp per capita level soon . 
  i do not know why your post is downvoted . 
  thank you very much for kind words . 
  ireland is ( and was ) also liked in poland . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsroh2xp-0 ) , for example , is the song ' i love you like ireland ' from 1990 . 
  greetings . 
  [ the return of the prodigal son ] ( http://www.timkenmuseum.org/collection/italian/return-prodigal-son ) s. 
  sorry for that - it was the google translate suggestion for polish -  english translation . 
  of course it should be kharkiv .

  no war going on . 
  no violence towards poles at all . 
  a [ pogrom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pogrom ) is a violent riot aimed at the massacre or persecution of an ethnic or religious group . 
  in the 1918 poland started to reborn . 
  poles started to organize structures of the country . 
  local jewish community of kielce had a meeting at the polish theatre . 
  the participants rallied behind the jewish demand for political and cultural autonomy . 
  this act could be judged as an hostile to the poland . 
  i 'm not trying to justify the beating and killing of four people , but it 's hard to call it as a ` pogrom ' . 
  imho . 
  do you read your sources ? 
  imho shoting at soldiers is bad idea - especialy during a war . 
  about przytyk ` pogrom ' ( from your source ) -  polish peasants attacked jews only after a jewish group had attacked poles , killing a peasant stanis\u0142aw wie\u015bniak . 
  [ 3 ] professor pawe\u0142 wieczorkiewicz of warsaw university praised gontarczyk 's work , writing in 2008 : `` gontarczyk , using available sources , has disproved the notion which is prevalent in historiography , about the riot , which took place in przytyk ( the alleged pogrom of the local jewish population ) '' . 
  [ 4 ] another polish historian , marek jan chodakiewicz , writes that the incident began when a jewish resident szulim chil leska shot in the back and killed stanis\u0142aw wie\u015bniak , who was an accidental passer-by . 
  this provoked anger among polish peasants , who attacked jews . 
  [ 5 ] etc. 
  so - please calm down and give some reliable sources . 
   btw i 'm somehow not surprised you 've never heard of this . 
  the way they teach xxth century history in poland is abysmal . 
  a [ pogrom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pogrom ) is a violent riot aimed at the massacre or persecution of an ethnic or religious group , particularly one aimed at jews . 
  in both cases you cited it was done by regular soldiers during the 1919/1920 war . 
  these people were accused for colaborating with communists and act like killing polish soldiers . 
  so 1 ) it 's hard to describe it like a pogroms , 2 ) these examples are controversial and [ historians do not judge clearly pinsk massacre ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/masakra_w_pi%c5%84sku ) - according to some authors , the execution was justified by warfare and the soldiers were convinced of the illegal purpose of the assembly , so their actions did not bear the mark of the crime . 
  please give me some reliable sources that claim your thesis about pogroms made by poles before ww2 . 
  if do n't have one , please do n't be so excited and do n't use easy associations and buzzwords in the future . 
   look at pogroms before ww2 pogroms before ww2 made by poles ? 
   is he polish ? 
  nope - he is from ukraine . 
   i do n't want to say , where i live in right now . 
  no problem . 
   i have a quite high perspective opinions on czechs . 
  do you agree with [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3hhtaezkem ) ? 
   our feeling is not reciprocated either , it seems . 
  and where are you from ? 
  i figured this out  it is hard for me to compare the results of poland and the czech - because they have different evaluation methods . 
  note that the first place for the czech republic is 85 % in criterion of ( 1 + 2 ) and 59 % in criterion of ` sympathy ' in case of poland . 
  i hope poles are not less empathetic than czechs and both countries like other people in similar proportions . 
  therefore , both of these statistics ca n't be comparable imho . 
  maybe if in czech studies the ` sympathy ' would be marked only for 1 - the results would be more comparable . 
  you can compare it in the criterion of place too : first vs fourteenth . 
   that 's not all that different from our standing in your poll . 
  it depends what the 1 +2 , 3 , and 4 +5 from the label means and if it could be comparable with the set like ( sympahty , indiference , anthipaty and do n't know ) . 
  it seems that our feeling is not reciprocated ... . 
  as far as i remember you are czech . 
  you had sources both in polish and english . 
  you are citing the polish version - do you prefer to read polish than english ? 
  so maybe time to turnover tax ? 
   just to be sure , by `` our '' i meant czech pm . 
  you 're right - it was not clear . 
  but the conclusions are the same imho - not only for us but also for other eu countries . 
   it 's because in everything else our pm is merkel 's obedient little dog . 
  not only only our . 
  it 's the whole eu . 
  hail our new lords . 
  germany tried to conquer europe 2 times in xx century . 
  and failed . 
  now is the third attempt . 
  and they seems to be succeed . 
  how the rest of eu feels with that ? 
   it 's ok v4 is generally united on this issue . 
  yeah , but only governments of poland and hungary are threatened by eu . 
  thanks to czech gov that decided to express unequivocal voice for this issue . 
  hope polish government will not be the only scapegoat . 
  thanks czechs !, 
   less atractive then somalia or afghanistan do not exaggerate  let 's start with something smaller - no pocket money . 
  maybe we should accept the policy proposed by [ tusk ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/44qkhj/leaked_transcripts_of_november_commission_turkey ) in november 2016 : he says that the ** eu can make itself less attractive to refugees ** . 
  do n't you think that it is the best solution ? 
  why giving free houses , free money , citizenships etc. 
  war refugees imho do not need that . 
  ** just get rid of the magnet that attracts economic migrants ** . 
  thank you for your time and detailed answer . 
  it looks like old good map drawn with pencils . 
  did you draw it by hand ? 
  politic is not a strict science . 
  it relays on the interpretation made by ` authorities ' and people who digest information - so try to conclude your own interpretation , not based on titles . 
  yea - we know that . 
  but you can trust us or not ? 
  that is the question . 
  good to know - but i was asking about poland . 
   the fact that you say it 's a soros doll is despicable .
