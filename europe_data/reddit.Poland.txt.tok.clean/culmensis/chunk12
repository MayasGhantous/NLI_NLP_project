  i had that impression from / u/crocoduck1 statement . 
   btw we offered to join poland just curious . 
  never heard of that . 
  can you give any sources ? 
   call it what you like , poland does n't want gay marriage , ... 
  seems to be personal for you . 
  please read about experience of gays walking hand-to-hand in places like london and other western countries . 
  it was not easy for them too . 
  there was a thread about it on reddit . 
  you can find openly gay and trans people in our parliament - please give me examples from all other western countries with that . 
  you know - for me your attitude is ` grass is greener ' in other places . 
  for me catholic education is important , because it is part of our ~ ~ education ~ ~ culture . 
  we accepted 800000 migrants from ukraine and we are ok with that . 
  the influx of economic migrants is caused by germany and sweden - they are giving huge amount of free money for them and promising easy get of citizenship . 
  it is just their fault not only for big influx of ` immigrants ' but also all of the deaths . 
  if accommodation and goods given away would be the same as in for example turkey or lebanon - all the influx would be stopped . 
  edit : education -  culture, 
  i should use an pc euphemism : ` temporary border controls ' instead of ` close of borders ', 
  you may notice a change in the meaning of ` tolerance ' in the last few days . 
  that is the question : where is the line between ` tolerance ' and common sense . 
  the swedes , for example , despite earlier declared ` tolerance ' send their refugees to finland and germany despite previous calls in the name of ` tolerance ' close their borders . 
  last time ? 
  here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kodnp/antiimmigration_protest_in_warsaw_poland_12092015/cv0e5wq, 
  not funny but sarcastic . 
  i have noticed many comments like that - from our swedish neighbours . 
  sweden - that shithole country ? 
  why poland need that ? 
  / s sorry - could n't resist . 
  stop giving out free money , homes , and health care to people for whom this is a fortune that acts as a magnet and is a reason to sacrifice the lives of their children . 
  you asked a question that you answered incorrectly yourself and pulled the wrong conclusions . 
   stupid cow using wording like that , you just downgraded all of your message . 
  unnecessarily . 
  we have many ( but not in your proportion ) ` darker ' people in poland . 
  they are assimilated in our society very well . 
  we have for example ` darker ' pm in our parliament . 
  and please do not be so pessimistic about our future . 
  hope we can stop it or at least keep in reasonable numbers . 
   ( yes its an old joke about poles stealing stuff :0 deal with it ) as you wish . 
  do you have any cool lamp shade with tattoos at home ? 
  it is rather ` to lead soldiers ' or ` leader of soldiers ' . 
  wojewoda -  ` woje ' - ` soldiers ' , and ` woda ' ( from ` wodzi\u0107 ' ) - ` to lead ' or ` leader ' . 
  we can base on other countries expiriences . 
  for example prime minister of germany , [ angela merkel said 5 years ago ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/10/16/uk-germany-merkel-immigration-iduktre69f19t20101016 ) , that multiculturalism failed in germany . 
  i see that in the same way . 
  [ do not thing so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_empire ) . 
  hungary seems to be a reasonable leader in our region . 
  best wishes for you magyars . 
  mass christening in stadiums ? 
  do you think , that merkel can get as profitable job in russian company , as former german chancellor - gerhard schr\u00f6der ? 
  [ fourth reich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_reich ) ? 
  where from have you got that impression that poles hate russians ? 
  that is not true . 
  we love every single russian - but without their tanks , government , sphere of influence and all that stuff . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hurjkotpu ) you have a polish traveler in russia . 
  the same attitude imho could have any russian in poland . 
  bust luck with that magyars . 
  sure - in criterion of controversy . 
  but \u017byrinowski is quite biased about poland and is anti-polish . 
  and korwin-mikke is quite pro-russian . 
  check his statements . 
  you mean people which sacrificing their children to get better life or new teeth ? 
  or people promising great , wonderful new life - for free ? 
   treceti batalioane romane carpati sound similar  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isi2x2coroc, 
   christ , they made it all the way to denmark as refugees ? 
  it is called [ inertia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inertia ) . 
   better life exactly . 
  he should not call them like that . 
  but without that he would not be heard . 
  and ` better life ' is not the same as ` safe life ' . 
  he is like that for dozens of years . 
  he is a controversial person . 
  people like to hear him - saying - he is right , but ... . 
  i like reading his texts . 
  anyway he had several political parties and movements and never reached more than a few percent in election . 
  that sounds like an invitation . 
  the consequence will be the next waves of refugees and repeat all these tragedies . 
  why do they do that ? 
  right - and people have short memory . 
  so imho it is worth recalling . 
  and some basic polish lessons . 
  lesson one : how to buy a train ticket . 
  what is the ethymology of this word ? 
  what does it literally mean ? 
  i hope that your country will be better in near future . 
  czech pragmatism . 
  but not on the level of president . 
  i do not know where are you from - you have a polish flair and you have your russian name on the other side . 
  but if you like that climate , please see : [ belarusians sing about polish hussars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drbbho2sgxe ) or old [ russia athem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dudmjjtqbec ) or [ russian song from wwii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvkt0q_r3dc ) - chapeau bas . 
  seems that rzeczpospolita ( or more precisely ldk ) could into space at that time , 
  you are from lithuania ? 
  good morning then . 
  well - rockets was quite eastern weapon at that time ... expected someone from mongolia or turkey at least . 
   fuck the hussars , we used rockets in this one . 
  despite of rockets you were fu-d . by us \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af allahu akbar . 
  sorry not to mention samogitians . 
  they gave us great kings . 
  but they are northern now . 
  so belarus and ukrainians were and are our bro . 
  poles , belarusians and ukrainians are the rzeczpospolita and samogitians are scandinavs or at least norhts now . 
  they choose not to be in our part .
