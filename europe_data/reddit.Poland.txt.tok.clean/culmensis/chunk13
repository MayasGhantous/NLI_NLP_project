  it is their choise . 
   fighting in the north was reserved for the rest of your neighbors . 
  belarus ? 
  they are our bros. 
  together with ukrainians . 
  exactly , but considering the root of this subthread it is not worth ot answer . 
  i mean / u/gas _ the_arabs_69 user . 
  that is true - if we could only shift back in time and tell them all the advices . 
  you are right - we did not win all the time . 
  by the way - in the battle of varna there were no hussars . 
  it was later . 
  that was the direction from which turks and tatars were attacking . 
  you mean hussars vs islam ?

  fictional person from polish movie that is known in post communist countries . 
  [ grigoriy saakashvili ] ( http://twoje-seriale.pl/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/gregorij.jpg ) was born there too . 
  you are struggling with russia similarly to our part of europe . 
  i also remember the speech of kaczynski in your capitol . 
  and thank you for that song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkycdz34ij8, 
  with what questions ? 
  germans need slaves and cheap workers and could get it by choosing from 800.000 new people . 
  unwanted people could be send back . 
  thus imho their giving away free houses and free pocket money as a magnet attracting poor people . 
  if it is truth - they are responsible for all the death and overcrowded countries on the south and on the path to germany . 
  if they would like to behave fair they should give up all of the big bloody money promised for refugees - to stop that madnes . 
   `` labor can always be cheaper '' is the corporate motto . 
  in a country like germany ? 
  would you provide different law for ` new germans ' ? 
  it would be a meisterst\u00fcck . 
  i read litvinenko book at that time . 
  the one that was poisoned by hexa plutonium-titanium azide complex - one of the most poisonous substance . 
  i agree that we should create one common policy towards all that people . 
  imho the problem lays on some rich countries - becouse they are taking all of the people , without considering whether they are actually refugees or people that are trying to get free stuff . 
  the problem , which lies in the fact that they are giving apartments for free , pocket money and hope for obtaining citizenship . 
  money and goods which they are giving away are bloody big . 
  they are big even for citizens from our part of europe . 
  there are many people in eu that would like to take this money ( 130 euro pocket money per month for germany ) from other countries in poorer part of eu . 
  not mentioning other poorest countries . 
  please stop that madness . 
  money that you are giving away is a magnet that is attracting all of that poor people . 
  we too ` chodzimy na kaw\u0119 ' . 
  merkel is giving away goods for ` refugees ' : free pocket money bigger that earning in other countries of eu , free homes and easy get citizenship - and expect other countries to do the same . 
  if not - germans will push . 
  i meant pocket money . 
  which is more than average monthly income per person in some of the countries in eu . 
  here you have some information in polish ( i 'm not a lawyer and can not help you with exact information - just googled ) : http://www.migrant.info.pl/prowadzenie_dzia%c5%82alno%c5%9bci_gospodarczej_w_polsce_przez_cudzoziemc%c3%b3w.html you have also many movies on youtube made by ukrainians about live in poland . 
  also about how to make a ` one man company ' . 
   lwov rigtful polish clay . 
  gib back . 
  poland stronk . 
  it seems that you are from croatia . 
  please stop trolling here . 
  poles do not want to take any part of ukraina or other countries . 
  i meant that i do not care if somebody say that poland is eastern or central europe . 
  but if somebody claim that poland is eastern europe becouse of communist past , than one should also treat former ddr in the same way . 
  haste makes waste . 
  there was no ` gold train ' in poland . 
  it was just another late train from 2005 . 
  do not care . 
  put me in the eastern part if you wish . 
  togeder with former ddr . 
  imho po and their representatives are example of rudeness and rednecks . 
  vice ceo of po ( palikot ) used to accuse their political opponents to homosexuality . 
  despite that that being gay is modern today . 
  they used it to discredit opponent . 
  what the f. ? 
  are they modern party or just using the same rethorics like stadion hooligans ? 
  hope this kind of hypocrisy will go away - together with michnik , lis and others . 
  thank you for your messages . 
  hope more people in future will share your ( our ) opinion . 
  lucky there is less and less people influenced by michnik , lis and cohortes propaganda based on spitting and outlook created in a sense of guilt . 
   btw i also criticized komorowski on reddit could you please send some examples ? 
  i like his writing . 
  imho we have many things common . 
  the headline is misleading . 
  we are not feared . 
  we have many ukrainians in poland today and they are welcomed . 
  duda did not use ` fear ' word . 
  maybe becouse you are taking all of the people , without considering whether they are actually refugees or people that are trying to get free stuff ? 
  imho sweden and germany are the source of the problem . 
  the problem , which lies in the fact that you are giving apartments for free , pocket money and hope for obtaining citizenship . 
  money and goods which you are giving away are bloody big . 
  they are big even for citizens from our part of europe . 
  there are many people in eu that would like to take this money ( 130 euro per month for germany ) from other countries in poorer part of eu . 
  not mentioning other poorest countries . 
  please stop that madness . 
  money that you are giving away is a magnet that is attracting all of that poor people . 
  you are right . 
  we should not . 
  but we are not talking about sub-saharian people - right ? 
  and please consider that we are not givin away free stuff . 
  refugess are escaping from here to your paradise . 
  i was in london recently and i nowhere saw 60 white people at once . 
  but it is sweden - right ? 
   now this is a crisis for which the north is as responsible as the south . 
  do not thing so . 
  the responsibility lies on some of the north countries . 
  they are giving away free houses , pocket money , free health care and promise of future citizenship for everybody that claim to be a war refugee . 
  they are working like magnets attracting much more poor people from all countries abroad . 
  all the countries lying on the path to the paradise are just a victim of this policy .
