  they are predicting temperature in hundreds years forward and at the same time they can not find reliable forecast weather for next few days . 
  we should inform them that they will be returned after war and be consequent . 
  if not , the stream of refugees will never be finished . 
  why not ? 
  if they will get rid all of that ` sphere of influence ' , imperialistic way of thinking . 
  good point . 
  i hope that the war will finish soon and they could return . 
  ukraine too . 
  refugees are not a citizens and they should not expect the same privileges as the hosts . 
  and please do not use argumentum ad personam . 
  just decrease amount of pocket money , give a roof above a head and promise that they will be expelled after the war will be ended . 
  it seems that a safe place is not sufficient for them . 
  they could be unhappy because they know that few hundreds kilometers west or north they could receive few time more money and goods . 
  imho big part of them are going to places where they can get biggest pocket money , free houses and easy citizenship . 
  countries like germany or sweden should imho decrease amount of free goods and the problem will be solved . 
  edit : spelling . 
   because poland annexed and cleansed it is a headline with a thesis . 
  poland did not annexed and cleansed . 
  this territory was given to poland by worldpowers conferences . 
  we did not ask about it . 
  i had history lessons many years ago . 
  there were many things that happened during wwii . 
  displacement of germans can be comparable to displacement of poles from former eastern part of poland . 
  both things were not important in the whole sea of evil and facts , to mention it . 
  on the other hand - [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_of_reconciliation_of_the_polish_bishops_to_the_german_bishops ) you have a information about letter of reconciliation send by polish bishops to german bishops . 
  it has the famous `` we forgive and ask for forgiveness '' sentence . 
  the letter was sent in 1965 . 
   so many poles talking shit about our glorious language . 
  now 's my turn . 
   so many poles talking shit about our glorious language . 
  now 's my turn . 
  your language is just [ cute and adorable ] ( http://intfolder.com/_ph/19/2/759282760.png?1440243844 ) . 
   the parts of germany that poland annexed post-wwii were ( in large part ) not much more polish than k\u00f6nigsberg / kaliningrad was russian . 
  not annexed but set by yalta world-powers conference . 
  we lost territories on the east and we were given territories on the west . 
  it was not polish decision . 
  anyway we lost territory in the criterion of the total area . 
  if you would like to revise the history - than here you go . 
  every country in europe could take a map and choose the period when their borders were the biggest . 
  i believe that your goal was to be honest , but statements like yours could provide to the new try to achieve national needs and ` historical truth ' . 
  be carefull . 
  from the other hand - big part of eastern germany and todays poland has a slav heritage and for sure the statement :  not much more polish than k\u00f6nigsberg / kaliningrad was russian . 
  is not truth . 
  even for todays parts of germoney . 
  anyway - thank you for your statement . 
  it is wort to think about . 
   we do n't give free apartments to ukrainians we are giving . 
  not only for ukrainians . 
   and the money they receive is ... ** wait for it ** ... pocket money . 
  130 $ per person . 
  please do not be sarcastic when you are talking about poor people . 
  but probably  you have n't seen much of the world according to the data from [ eurostat ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do?dvsc=8 ) for 2013 , the ` two-earner married couple , one at 100 % , the other at 33 % of aw with two children ' ( 4 person family ) , the monthly income per person is : poland : 220 euro , lithuania : 172 euro , romania : 125 euro , bulgaria : 116 euro . 
  and this is amount of money do not include free flats , medical care , insurance etc. 
  please do not demoralise people from real world and realy poor countries with your lack of knowledge . 
  lack of knowledge concerning other countries . 
  even that ones from your neighbourhood . 
  i do not know exact percentage - but some of them - yes . 
  near me lives family from eastern ukraine which get asylum . 
  they got a flat and and monthly pocket money . 
  i 'm ok with that . 
  i 'm sure that they will be part of our society without any future demand of payment . 
  they are welcomed . 
  the amount of money they received is not big even for their earning in former country . 
  but on the other hand you - germans , swedes , uk 's etc. 
  are giving for free flats , goods , citizenships and money to any people declaring that they are refugees . 
  the amount of monthly money that are not comparable with their whole life earnings . 
  it is a big desire and the thing that one can sacrifice his/her or their children life . 
  paradoxically you could be responsible for all the deaths . 
   it 's forbidden to make ** homosexual innuendoes ** in russia , so no , we did n't ** smoke them out ** . 
  such a short sentence and so many hidden desires . 
  this article describes poland in context of taken refugees from syria and trying to compare it to the refugees taken by germany . 
  but syria and africa are not the only places which are in danger and places from people are escaping . 
  there are [ estimations ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society ) that in poland are 300,000-400 ,000 ukrainians . 
  in january and february , the number of residence applications by ukrainians in the mazovian voivodeship -- the province which includes warsaw -- was up 180 % on the same months of 2014 . 
  so the problem is with the numbers of taken refugees or with their origin ? 
   also was a former home army resistance member who supported a violent overthrow of soviet-sympathizers in the government . 
  yet another factor to treat him like a tragic hero . 
   you want to expel a group of people please reread my message . 
   kicking the poles oh c'mon . 
  you just spoiled such a great opportunity . 
  [ ryszard siwiec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryszard_siwiec ) was a polish accountant and former home army resistance member who was the first person to commit suicide by self-immolation in protest against the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihjrs9pwbwk ) is the footage of this issue . 
  strongly nsfw . 
  nice . 
  i just learned a new word . 
  the term indo-european refers to the heritage of language and culture rather than the place from which the nation comes from . 
  the cradle of indo-european languages and cultures according to `` kurgan hypothesis '' is located north of the black sea , caucasus mountains and caspian sea and including parts of eastern ukraine , southern russia and northwest kazakhstan . 
  from that place people migrated to different location - among them - europe and india . 
  not that i supported what you say , but the answer is india . 
  we used to say in such a cases that it 's easier to jump over than walk around . 
   it 's very possible poland would be todays russia . 
  better one  . 
  if we are supposed to speak english with all the cultural connotations , then : i 'm just fine . 
  thank you . 
  and you ? 
  but if you are really wonder - it 's bloody hot here . 
  even at night . 
  our rivers are drying and we had no rain for few weeks . 
  the temperature in the next week will be even higher . 
  but we will survive .
