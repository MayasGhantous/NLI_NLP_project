  i hope . 
  1938 - agree - to use opportunity created by germans was our bad . 
  1968 - it was not a decision of sovereign nation . 
  all of our sympathy was anti-communist and anti-soviet in 1945-1989 period . 
  you can say many things about poles , but not that we are collaborators or cowards . 
  from the other hand - czechoslovakia before wwii also had some comparable movements . 
  poles hate china ? 
  never heard about it . 
  there is article from 2008 in china internet with the similar title . 
  and that is probably the reason that chinese search engine gives such a suggestion . 
  happy national day !, 
  i do not like it . 
  edit after -2 downvote : there is no substantive discussion . 
  just an anti-russia circle-jerk . 
  it could be done by putin bots just to show how / r/europe is anti-russian . 
  of course - my city - [ che\u0142mno ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=che\u0142mno&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) aka english culm or german kulm . 
   uses a mix of english and german ? 
  it could be yiddish as well . 
   i know the halachic opinions . 
  it is not only the halachic opinion . 
  the so-called ' [ right of return ] ( http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfa-archive/1950-1959/pages/law%20of%20return%205710-1950.aspx ) ' of secular israel state setting out the rules for granting citizenship of israel , defines the term ` jew ' :  for the purposes of this law , `` jew '' means a person who was born of a jewish mother or has become converted to judaism and who is not a member of another religion . '', 
  hope you will not use argumentum ad personam again . 
  agree . 
  poles not only live in todays border of poland . 
  and i 'm not talking about expats . 
  poles in todays lithuania are and were living there for hundreds years . 
  here is the [ website ] ( http://kurierwilenski.lt/ ) of polish minority in lithuania . 
  hope my part of todays poland will not be in the future under other nation government . 
  and even then , the ` true ' poland will take care about me . 
  / u/eisenkatze said :  yeah it kinda sounds like the `` you guyyyys i 'm so eastern european my eyebrows have eyebrows , check out thith fabulous borscht my slavic babushka taught me how to make '' thing . 
  omfg they 're dumplings , no one gives a shit . 
  heard many things about poland , east european or slavs - but never heard this one :  i 'm so eastern european my eyebrows have eyebrows is there any stereotype about the polish or east european or slavs eyebrows in lithuania ? 
   also why is your soup pink ? 
  because of the young beet . 
  sometimes there are also added the young beet leaves . 
  then the soup is called [ botwina ] ( http://f.o2.pl/frd45/fa32307b00031f704c571050/201008_dt_botwina_02.jpg ) . 
   you have , it 's just not that awesome and amazing it is a matter of taste . 
  i like it . 
  ok poland has no national food . 
  lithuanians have plenty . 
  happy now ? 
   fuck no . 
  why not ? 
  cool soups are popular in europe . 
  look at spanish gazpacho or balkan tarator . 
  in poland we have also fruit soups served cooled . 
  adjectives identifying countries in context of food is mostly inadequate - see ` ryba po grecku ' or ` pierogi ruskie ' ( fish a ` la greek and pierogies a ` la russian ) . 
  for the summer and the temperatur the [ ch\u0142odnik ] ( http://louloublog.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/chlodnik1-670x502.jpg ) ( cool soup ) is the best . 
  i ate few days ago . 
  these all elections in belarus are simple waste of money . 
  we can kill two birds with one stone . 
  i think merkel will not agree , but we will try . 
  no , no , no . 
  it would not work . 
  we need people . 
  people that you care about . 
  people that are important for you . 
  people that you will try to stay safe . 
  people like : taylor swift , meghan trainor , fetty wap , obama , rihanna , clintons , nick jonas - just most of the [ billboard artists ] ( http://www.billboard.com/artists/top-100 ) and some of the politicians or even soldiers with some of their toys . 
  we can prepare nice resorts in eastern poland . 
  free beer , eating and accomodations . 
  interested ? 
   take our us bases . 
  they have drones , nuclear weapons and monitoring stations . . all we need is a a human shield . 
  you can keep all the nukies and other toys . 
   * inside joke . 
  literally : bird 's - mug . 
  it is not a matter of solar light , but influx of saharan hot air . 
  without stronger wind . 
  as long as exists a [ jewish terror ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.668871 ) permitting the extermination of the palestinians , imho everybody should limit cooperation with israel . 
  regardless how catchy they will issue in movies : the suffering of children , the homeless , helpless etc. 
  bravo norway - and not be afraid to be called - anti-semites . 
  you are doing a good job . 
  it 's a matter of principles . 
   jewish `` blood '' ? 
  i thought it was a religion not a race . 
  it 's like saying someone had atheist `` blood '' . 
  not really . 
  jew according to rabbinic law is any person whose mother or maternal grandmother is a jew . 
  it is pure definition ` by blood ' . 
  you can not be sure who is the father of a child , but you can be sure who is the mother . 
  more restrict rules applies to the secular state of israel . 
  the so-called ' [ right of return ] ( http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfa-archive/1950-1959/pages/law%20of%20return%205710-1950.aspx ) ' setting out the rules for granting citizenship of israel , defines the term ` jew ' :  for the purposes of this law , `` jew '' means a person who was born of a jewish mother or has become converted to judaism and who is not a member of another religion . '', 
  it would be pity to lose redditors from russia . 
  have you tried this one : https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en ? 
  that communism was created and led by jews . 
   japanese confuse poland with netherlands ( holland ) not only japanese . 
  ` poland ' sounds similarly like ` holland ' . 
  polish [ president kaczy\u0144ski said ] ( https://youtu.be/ls0ftk9hz-c?t=70 ) in 2008 in georgia : ` we know very well that today it is georgia , tomorrow ukraine , the day after it will be the baltic states ... and later it could be a time for my country - poland . ', 
  some of his predictions came true , but i hope he was a bad prophet . 
   that does n't apply when drunk . 
  it 's very interesting explanation . 
  however , according to this theory , saunas are used only by drunken people . 
  and it probably is not true . 
  and what about this theory : that does n't apply when naked ? 
  it was a joke about famous scandinavian personal space [ issue ] ( http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/fc/fc05c93286e10da65e9f3e3ce36404d997290265b38031ddedabcacfde2ea6fd.jpg ) . 
  how big should be the sauna to keep 5 meters distance from each ? 
  to be honest , i must admit that / u/haitei [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3glztf/what_is_a_nice_tradition_you_saw_in_another/ctzks9r ) inspired me . 
  for the first time i read it as ` cute little girls in the windows ' , i gave plus and then reread it again that this is about some lights in sweden . 
  i was desapointed and decided to fix it .
