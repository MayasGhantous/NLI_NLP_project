  all these beautiful young girls in shop windows in the netherlands . 
  hopefully . 
  my point was that the idea of getting rid off countries that war conflict is more probable is quite popular not only in part of british mps but also in part of redditors from ` safe ' countries . 
  imho they do not take into account that their countries can also be viewed as threat in the future . 
  and in this case they would probably change their attitude . 
   with a sheep full of sulfur seems to be common : according to his chronicle , the frightening monster appeared during the reign of king krakus ( lat . 
  gracchus ) . 
  the dragon required weekly offerings of cattle , if not , the humans would have been devoured instead . 
  in the hope of killing the dragon , krakus called on his two sons , lech and krakus ii . 
  they could not , however , defeat the creature by hand , so they came up with a trick . 
  they fed him a calf skin stuffed with smoldering sulfur causing his fiery death . 
  then the brothers argued about who deserves the honor for slaying the dragon . 
  the older brother killed the younger brother grakch ( krakus ) , and told that the dragon killed him . 
  when he became king , his secret was revealed , and he got expelled from the country . 
  the city was named in recognition of the brave and innocent krakus . 
  we should get rid off these states from nato . 
  because the rest countries are peaceful and would like to live in peace .

  five european [ presidents were visiting georgia ] ( https://youtu.be/ls0ftk9hz-c?t=70 ) during that time . 
  president of poland said : ` we know very well that today it is georgia , tomorrow ukraine , the day after it will be the baltic states ... and later it could be a time for my country - poland . ', 
   to be fair to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair , to be fair .

  why do you assume that in poland history lessons are lead in different way ? 
  have you ever been to poland ? 
  or do you participated in history lessons in poland ? 
  why do you extrapolate your point of view to other norden countries ? 
  you do not know to much about polish-scandinavian ( or more precisely - swedish ) history . 
  you do not know if the same facts are taught in polish and sweden schools and what is the interpretation of it . 
  but you know that your history lessons are ` not nationalistic ' and you are ` not good guys all the time ' . 
  is it enough to you to judge other nations history lessons ? 
  strange - is n't it ? 
  imho - this point of view is quite arrogant . 
   do poles recognize that the ussr did the vast majority of the work in defeating germany ? 
  we recognize that we were attacked by germany and russia in 1939 . 
  and at the end russia won . 
  and stayed here for almost 50 years . 
    becouse you belong to common finno-ugric tribes  you said that . 
  no only me . 
   and about deluge ( never heard this term before ) . 
  we should primarily discuss how it affected us and not how it affected the poles . 
  that is what i 'm talking about - we have no common history . 
  it is not your business . 
  you do not have nothing in common about scandinavian - polish history . 
  and you are trying to talk how ` history classes here take pretty neutral stance ' in all of the nordic countries . 
  imho ` neutral stance ' in your case can be derived from just an ignorance . 
  history is not strict science as for example mathematics . 
  you do not have thesis that have one and the only answer which you can prove . 
  in history the same situations can be described in different ways . 
  every country or nation has it 's own interpretation of history . 
  do you know the best , non biased interpretation of history in any european country ? 
   haha . 
  russians are not finno-ugric . 
  never said that . 
   we are just an actor of what ?
