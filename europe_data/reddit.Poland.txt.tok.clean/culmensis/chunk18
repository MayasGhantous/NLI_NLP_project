  of our common history . 
   and what is deluge ? 
   if you 'd like to clear that up i 'd appreciate it . 
  ok .  i do n't know why you brought up hungarians and russians though . 
  becouse you belong to common [ finno-ugric tribes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_peoples ) and while reading posts here in reddit i noticed that swedes describes you as russian relatives with simillar behaviour . 
  you are not german tribe such as other scandinavians . 
  we have no common history . 
  we have common history with other scandinavians - but not with you . 
  and for me it is odd that you are trying to extrapolate to all the nordic nations to have better standards with learning history . 
  you are not just an actor of it . 
  if you would like - check if other scandinavians are tought about deluge and all of it consequences in their classes . 
  you know and we know that all the term ` nordic ' was discovered for you . 
  you as finland are not scandinavian and are separate nation similar to hungarian - which are our friends by the way , or russians . 
  you can try to stick to scandinavian nations and try to approximate your opinion to their ones - but it works only for you or estonians . 
  if you would like to know something about polish - scandinavian relationships and scandinavians interpretation of history , please see the deluge wiki pages . 
  they have stolen our goods and seems to be proud of it . 
  do you too ? 
   history classes here take pretty neutral stance . 
  i have the same feeling about our classes and our interpretation of history . 
  thank you . 
  is there any other nation that have the pretty neutral stance ? 
  why limit yourself to a few centuries ? 
  i hope you 're aware that the etymologhy of cities names in eastern germany are slavic ? 
  such as for example : berlin ( swamp ) , roztock ( distribution of a river ) or l\u00fcbeck , which comes from word liking or lovely . 
  so you have different interpretation of belgian history depending on the nation ? 
  you have different history books etc ? 
  is this division visible in the criterion level of education - what about mixed classes or groups at university level - which i believe are mixed . 
   anyway it is the victors who write history , not losers . 
  exactly . 
  that is why it could be interesting for mainstream interpreters . 
   easiest way to provoke a pole on the internet is to deny polish `` version '' of history . 
  it is believed like a religion in the country . 
  imho each country has its own interpretation of history . 
  this applies not only to poles . 
   ethnic cleansing works wonders . 
  not everytime and not for everybody . 
  masterrace ???? 
  / s jews were counted as untermenschen afaik . 
  this thread concerns slovakia , so not many people from western countries are interested and participating in it imho . 
  afair there were many posts that people from west was discussing about roma people in not so politically correct form . 
  have a good night too . 
  i 'm not talking about this post . 
  i 'm talking about generalisations you made . 
  not bad , 
  i 'm just trying not to judge people because of the criteria of belonging to a particular race or geography . 
  that is all .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiziganism#denmark ) [ after 2005 germany deported some 50,000 people , mainly romanis , to kosovo . 
  these were asylum seekers who fled the country during the kosovo war . 
  the people were deported after living more than 10 years in germany .

  hope it would change your biased attitude concerning so called ` east europeans ' . 
  there is a reason why other slavs call as ` psheks ' , 
  for sure  but it is observable also for movies from 50-90 's . 
  and this [ movie ] ( https://youtu.be/bwqzlfhsqu0 ) that was assembled entirely of original material shot by the insurgents . 
  on the other hand - have you noticed how skinny people was compared to our times ? 
  pics or it did n't happen . 
  at first - street and city plates will be forbidden for minority languages . 
  i do not know statistics but there is many ukrainian movies in youtube . 
  it seems that they feel well in poland and probably would stay . 
  from my personal experience : the girl in barbershop is living in poland for more than 10 years , similarly the clarks in shops , the restaurace owners will not start the bussines if they want to be back . 
  on the other hand there is big amount of ukrainian students and it is hard to say what they will choose in the future . 
  in polish the etymology for herbata comes from latin ` herba ' and ` tea ' . 
  our languages are similar . 
  this may be a factor . 
  i live in a city quite far from the east border , but i meet ukrainians very often . 
  recently i was in ukrainian restaurant in our city , my hair was cut by ukrainian girl in barbershop , they work in local drugstore and other shops . 
  it seems that they are integrating very well in our society . 
  for me it is very ok that they are coming here . 
  i heard this one for bmw : [ ** b ** ierny , ** m ** ierny ale ** w ** ierny ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zasada_bmw ) which means : passive mediocre but loyal and is used as negative description of some people , used in human resources decisions context . 
  do not expect fast answer . 
  it is an example of clash of different cultures . 
  assuming that we are talking about different cultures living in our own - should we force them to ban it , should we appreciate the cultural difference , or should we just talk about it with a hope that they would change it . 
  do not you think , that cross on the flag could be offensive to some cultural minorities ? 
  russia will ban flowers not only from netherlands but also from : lithuania , latvia , sloviakia , czech , italy , germany and poland .

   a war that started because of a football match which one ? 
   and this , son , is how the world works . 
  it is difficult to estimate the consequence of trivial facts . 
  for example , one of the revolutions began because of cakes . 
  just curious - maybe it is clear for post-ussr countries , but not for all east-european countries . 
   polish people always cry from joy when they come to visit . 
  [ yea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7q_qryejek ) . 
  what is wrong with that picture ? 
  to be lightened or to be into space . 
  this is the question . 
  this is another footage of this issue : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax6kd0ksrym description from the movie : this footage was not recorded in iraq or syria ... this happened in debrecen , hungary since the beginning of 2015 an unprecedented number of illegal immigrants arrived in hungary . 
  today hungary is a primary route for illegal immigrants in to the european union . 
  more than 75 000 immigrants arrived in hungary illegally this year alone , hungary has the highest number of incoming immigrants per citizen . 
  at this rate , the number of illegals will reach the population of a medium sized city by the year 's end . 
  in debrecen the number of illegal immigrants reached more than twice the capacity of the migrant camp in a matter of weeks . 
  a religious fight broke out at the camp between two groups of illegal immigrants , which then spilled out on to the neighboring streets . 
  the enraged illegal immigrants attacked passing cars , and set trash cans on fire . 
  this is the reason hungary is building a fence on its border with serbia : to protect the people of hungary and the people of europe . 
  if things continue as they are , this will be happening in your country soon ... if it is n't already .
