  in debrecen the number of illegal immigrants reached more than twice the capacity of the migrant camp in a matter of weeks . 
  a religious fight broke out at the camp between two groups of illegal immigrants , which then spilled out on to the neighboring streets . 
  the enraged illegal immigrants attacked passing cars , and set trash cans on fire . 
  this is the reason hungary is building a fence on its border with serbia : to protect the people of hungary and the people of europe . 
  if things continue as they are , this will be happening in your country soon ... if it is n't already . 
  [ polish lorries ] ( http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1348,title,napad-na-polskich-kierowcow-we-francji,wid,17688507,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=11548f&amp;_ticrsn=3 ) were also attacked and the meat was destroyed . 
  i 'm talking about labeling people . 
   slavic nazis always make me laugh . 
  there are some words-keys that are used to describe the world . 
  it lays on the level of emotions but not the level science . 
  if you use words like ` nazi ' , ` fascist ' , ` terrorist ' , ` far-right ' , ` muslim ' etc as the first - you will won the dispute . 
  it is described in the [ godwin 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law ) . 
  imho you should not be so excited about labels used by someone else . 
  interesting question . 
  every country has a margin of aggressive people . 
  you can compare countries by different factors such as for example number of murder , rapes , robberies etc. 
  in this criterions poland is safe country , afair safer than average eu . 
  on the other hand , in my personal opinion , the level of aggressiveness is lowering in criterion of time . 
  you mean ' [ dresy ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/nonsensopedia/images/d/d6/hitlerdres.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080607162527 ) ' . 
  this word comes from the sport suit ( in polish - [ dresy ] ( http://www.prezenty.pro/art/wp-content/uploads/dres-adidas.jpg ) ) and people wearing it . 
  the fashion is changing and now dresy is passe in poland . 
   it 's funny because i 'm from a country where polish immigrants are enemy number 1 . 
  what is that country ? 
   yeah , who does n't wan na piss off daddy and fuck a catholic ? 
  i have an impression that this statement is quite anti-catholic , 
  joke not so sophisticated but in accordance with our conservative needs and opportunities . 
   jesus , its like 1950 's mississippi mississippi women were looking for their opportunity to had a group , wild sex with exotic foreigners and looked for stupid excuses for their husbands ? 
  or that the woman is * sex hungry maniac * . 
  but it would be sexist , not racist . 
  ftfy : refugees . 
  we have many immigrants from ukraine for example and we do not complain about them . 
  sense of humor similar to famous ` captain sweden ' . 
   here 's what i meant ddr ? 
   til poland is n't eastern europe . 
  reddit teaches , entertains and educates . 
  nordic or scandinavian ? 
  is n't it quite opposite to quran thoughts ? 
  how can you agree your faith and your beliefs ? 
   not possible for 2 million people to leave the country possible . 
  ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ for ^ ^ bad ^ ^ joke . 
  spasiba . 
   '' ( cigarette ) butt '' and `` pale moth '' how it is in russian language ? 
  yeah !, 
  let 's make a song about it . 
  we ( irish and polish ) were many times oppressed and during that time we were fighting mostly but also we have made our nationals songs . 
  we like minor scales and you - major . 
  but maybe we can make something between the scales , 
   that 's nice , it is not just nice . 
  it is great !, 
  the celts - slavic brotherhood forever !, 
  in all the germanic ocean !, 
  monica was as polish as you are scandinavian or even northen , 
  not exactly - sulfur or s02 products are added to every wine . 
  i remember that amount of sulfur was considered as criterion of quality of wine . 
  but every wine has it amount of so2 in it . 
  even the best one . 
  one amateur of cigars and one jewess . 
  they have a wonderful time together . 
  they enjoyed each other . 
  why are you so aggressive trolls to spoil this wonderful feeling of two people ? 
  shame on you . 
  you are wrong - the ` jabol ' culture is much more older . 
  for foreigners : the ` jabol ' is a wine made of fruits . 
  most popular in poland in the communists time was the wine made from apples . 
  it is ( was ) considered as cheep equivalent of other alcoholic beverage . 
  most famous was for example : ' [ z\u0142ota reneta ] ( http://www.winka.net/image/etykiety/zlota-reneta-1901.jpg ) ' . 
  none of the average people would give it for their guests . 
  it was considered as alcohol beverage made for alcoholics or young people without the money . 
  just like me at that time  . 
  we made a competition who will drink the whole bottle ( 0.7 littre ) and my time was 13 seconds . 
  it was good times . 
  it was also called : acid - becouse of so2 . 
  and from of that we have for example this rock-band - [ acid drinkers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhk4vmawyxq ) . 
  anyway - we had beverages like cider in comunist tieme but it was considered as beverage for alcoholics . 
  recently i was in london and cider is quite popular there . 
  some of the products was similar to our old known ` jabol 's but there was also other kind of ciders and it was quite good for me . 
  some of ciders smells and taste like a jabol . 
  the difference is the co2 and lower volume of alcohol . 
  i did not want to correct you in any way . 
  if it looks so - sorry . 
  i was just wonder how many ukrainians have you received . 
  how many ? 
   so many countries claim to be out 17th bundesland . 
  [ ... ] poland [ ... ] soon it 's time for anschluss . 
  never heard it in poland ... . 
  scary question - in which country such claims exists ? 
   not crowned by the pope to be more precise . 
  afaik - the pope was not crowning by himself personally . 
  for example - polish kings were crowned by archbishops or primates . 
  the pope used to give the permission . 
  and mendog received it at 17.07.1251 . 
  lithuanians are using some czech letters also : \u010d \u0161 \u017e - before it was like in polish : cz , sz and \u017c . https://pl.wikibooks.org/wiki/litewski/alfabet, 
   r/europe is once again proving its racism by downvoting me , typical what is your race if i may ask ? 
  maybe this not depends on length of occupation but the length of being free . 
  imao she is trying to put the responsibility for her choosing on other persons . 
  it is not fair . 
  as i understand it - norway taxpayers gives money to religious groups . 
  the amount of money depends on the number of followers of a religion . 
  have you some strict rules that allow people to assign to a specific faiths - catholics , muslims , or lutherans ? 
  such as for example - declarations of individuals .
