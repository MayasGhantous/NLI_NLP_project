  [ parthenogenesis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parthenogenesis ) - like in the [ seksmisja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfj9pkwz2wc ) movie . 
  i remember when i was a kid in last 80 ' and a friend from my class was talking about kiwi that he tried , because his friends sent it from abroad - he said that it looks like a potato , but green inside and taste like a strawberry . 
  i was impressed , becouse i liked strawberries . 
  sry - this is the source : https://youtu.be/s2en6ubg8fa,

  i was asking about concentration camps . 
  do you use it also for other countries ? 
  thank you for your explanations . 
  it works the same way in polish language . 
  and i think it works in all languages - at least coming from protoeuropean language . 
  but [ here ] ( http://www.bookdrum.com/images/books/129863_m.png ) you have the map with the list of concentration camps in europe . 
  do you use expression like ` dutch concentration camps ' , ` french concentration camps ' , ` italian concentration camps ' , etc in relation to nazi concentration camps in other countries ? 
  the [ most popular surname ] ( http://surnames.behindthename.com/top/lists/hungary/2006 ) in hungary is nagy ( huge ) - so you are wrong . 
  * you can check that sentences exists in google search for the websites .

  we have relatively few black people in modern poland . 
  during communist times it was even less . 
  if movie makers had a black man in cast they sometimes used a such of [ trick ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/film/033/87/63/0356387.jpg ) . 
  i have never heard such a term . 
  the negative self-image of poles in poland in terms of the attitude to money is contained in the proverb : ' [ zastaw si\u0119 a postaw si\u0119 ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarmatyzm ) ' - ` take a loan and show yourself ' . 
  and it is rather contrary to your statement . 
  greetings from poland romania . 
  thank you for appreciating my country . 
  look at the modern austria and their attitude to the past . 
  the country that contributed to nazi ideology . 
  the country that participated mostly in gestapo and ` nazis ' death camps staff . 
  the country that world powers let to remain in west influence . 
  and now they dare to teach other countries how to behave . 
  shameful . 
  if not 1956 and world powers agreement to let them remains behind the ussr influence , they would be like the former ddr . 
  and look at the comments above :  the remaining 69 % are gypsies !!!!!, 
    yeah , they are n't `` worth anything '' , apparently .

  first version : yes . 
  you are right . 
  thank you for your freedom . 
  / s second version : yes - we remember about 1945 . 
  and thank you - really . 
  but please remember that before that poland was taken apart by russia and germany in 1939 . 
  we remember all of your people that died in our country in 1945 . 
  the people not only russians heritage , but all of the ussr countries . 
  but after 1945 ( and in 56 % of our area in 1939 ) communist terror started in our country . 
  my grandpa was sent to ural mines . 
  he died because of that . 
  in 1945 you sent us your own disease . 
  communist disease . 
  that disease that sent you and all of the occupied countires back for 50 years before it was beaten . 
  communist disease , that killed your intelligentsia and best part of your country , that disease that you are grateful for this day . 
  and this part of your shameful history that you are so proud of it . 
  it is strange for me . 
  just say - it was communist regime that we did not want . 
  it was pushed for our society . 
  we are not responsible for it . 
  and we are ashamed of it . 
  after that statement - we are all yours . 
  so - you - and who is the other one ? 
  actually : russian german condominium under jewish receivership . 
  so - ukrainians are better option as refugees in czech or poland , or isis members , or african islamists ?

  it 's better to talk than fight . 
  hope we can get along with this . 
  without russia or other countries trying to be a judge conducting ` divide et impera ' policy . 
  it is issue between our countries and i 'm glad that we are able to discuss about it on the professional , historical level . 
   soviet helpers have n't arrived in large numbers to conduct holodomor in bigger area ?
