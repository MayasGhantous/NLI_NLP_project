  to mass deport of people to siberia and khazakhstan ? 
  to occupy more lands ? 
  to kill people because of their ` class heritage ' ? 
  no - thank you . 
  and please - stay away from this issue . 
  it is not your business - russia - we can get along with that i hope . 
  please not to try this old policy - divide et impera . 
  i do not claim that we do not receive a lot of money . 
  but please be precise if you are comparing and giving exact values . 
  please note that value of $ changed in time and that poland also contribute to eu funds and that you are talking about future plans - we will live - we will see ( \u041f\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043c -- \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c ) . 
  according to this page : http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=1&amp;year=1946 the current value of 1946 $ 1 is $ 12.90 . 
  according to wiki , united states gave $ 13 billion , which is $ 167.72 bilion current dollars . 
  it reminds poland in communists time . 
  hope you will improve . 
  in my town the main street ( now grudzi\u0105dzka street ) changed it 's name very often : until 1772 : grubi\u0144ska , after partition of poland ( prussian occupation ) : 1773 : grosse gasse , 1774 : grubno oder graudentzer strasse , 1820 : graudenzer stra\u00dfe , 1903 : graudenzerstra\u00dfe , after rebirth of poland : 1923 : grudzi\u0105dzka , during wwii - german occupation : 1939-1945 : hermann-g\u00f6ring-stra\u00dfe . 
  after the wwii we changed the name to the grudzi\u0105dzka again . 
  i can not imagine a street name like hermann-g\u00f6ring-stra\u00dfe , lenin street , engels street or stalin street . 
  probably you also changed the towns names and streets names after german occupation . 
  is it still alive ? 
  who won this year ? 
  where are they coming from and how are they going to vote ?

  the words were those of 18-year-old pole - helena wanda b\u0142a\u017cusiak\u00f3wna , a highland woman incarcerated on 25 september 1944 . 
  it read ` oh mamma do not cry -- immaculate queen of heaven support me always ' .

  then take and store them . 
  if you do not wont to carry out investigations and court proceedings . 
  why incitement conquered nations ? 
  imho - the communists tried to destroy all signs of religiosity . 
  nature does not like a vacuum - that 's why for today 's russia to the rank of religion has grown memory of the so-called ` great patriotic war ' . 
  the russians at memorials ` victory ' conduct for example weddings , held academies and parades . 
  in place of religion they embraced the cult memorials in honor of ` victory ' . 
  in place of churches they have memorials . 
  it is true that the ussr defeated nazi germany . 
  but they also contributed to the death of many millions of people not only in russia but in many frontier countries . 
  before the ` great patriotic war ' as well as many years after it . 
  now they are taking all of the grandpas and expect gratitude from the descendants of the conquered nations . 
  my grandpa was taken to ural mines after wwii - maybe the combatants from the movie was the guards that escorted him to the gulag ? 
  maybe the people interrupting the ceremony was also descendants of oppressed people ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  can you describe the issue ? 
  some kind of free research to make a new startup website ? 
  good idea and good luck . 
  might be a good idea for a new prosperous business ... 
  i do not know about london , but in poland you can buy some products : [ obolon beer ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/141966005/obolon_svitle_lager_beer.jpg ) , [ lvivskie beer ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/lvivske_beer_advertisement_ ( 01 \\ ) . jpg ) , [ chumak ketchup ] ( http://img.21food.com/userimages/aristarh37/aristarh37$21918553.jpg ) . 
  is this whole army and all equipment ? 
  it 's linear dependencies and should give the same solution despite of way of calculating . 
  it was calculating like this : round ( ( infergment/population ) ) \\* 1000000 ; 0 ) and round ( ( late/population ) ) \\* 1000000 ; 0 ), 
  you are right . 
  the data is sorted only by last column . 
  if it would be sorted by both columns germany will be the 2-nd and you 3-rd . 
   someone should make it per capita . 
  i made it myself : http://i.imgur.com/zzlnvck.png . 
  it is the same data but per capita .

  the candidate with 20 % support is pawe\u0142 kukiz - singer and lider of band piersi ( breasts  i respect him , etc. 
  but if someone is interested in his songs - i 'm pasting a couple of links : https://youtu.be/1cfzjux99ck https://youtu.be/nprcmkhb2_0 https://youtu.be/ydicmnzolk0 https://youtu.be/-_nhbwyupgy https://youtu.be/kovgbor9ng8, 
  i have an account in bank that give you chart like this also . 
  you can see all transactions with the category . 
  from time to to time there are ` unknown ' category and you can set this transaction to predefined category or category created by you . 
  you can also change the predefined category . 
  so the bank has a predefined relations : store -  category and bank has also users choices for this relations , which probably let them improve the system . 
   polish elections are not news outside poland . 
  swedish are .

   ` looks like a jew , speaks like a jew ...  i do n't know . 
  he does n't observe jewish customs in films . ', 
  on the other hand - not bad review of star wars . 
   do you mean chechen ? 
  exactly - barbaric ( k ) language , 
  from my polish pow exactly the same feelings . 
  probably the same for : hungarian , lithuanian , latvian , estonian , polish , eastern germany , czechs , slovakian , romanian , moldavian , bulgarian , mongolian , ukrainian , georgian , chechen , belarusian , kazakhstanian , etc. 
  - everyland that soviet tanks could achieved . 
  edit : chechen . 
  from my point of view - before 1939 there was 2 socialist superpowers that had their own recipe how to set the whole world for their own . 
  communists wanted to spread their own ideology based on people class diversification and germany based on race diversification . 
  we - poland were in the middle of that struggle . 
  there was no cure for that situation and no one blame you for that . 
  after 1945 race criterion was abandoned but communist criterion unfortunately was not . 
  that was simply pity that we were on the wrong side of the iron curtain . 
  exactly . 
  it was not about a one season 's food . 
  but about 50 years of ussr 's occupation . 
  and therein lies the whole drama . 
  you should hurry up and took more land . 
  soviet and german secret services coordinated actions against polish resistance on [ gestapo and nkvd conferences ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestapo%e2%80%93nkvd_conferences ) . 
   you are not colonies but parasites . 
  strange argument - i have a feeling that i 've heard that before . 
  would you like maybe to add that we are also dirty , we are spreading bedbugs , we are a disgrace to all nations , conspire to gain power , etc ? 
  are you just trying to cure your own complexes ? 
   poland gets 3 % of gdp net from the eu it is not a big price to have another colonies ( nothing personal - i 'm not talking about you finland ) . 
  yeah . 
  but they had nokia - and they are in the nordic club recently .
