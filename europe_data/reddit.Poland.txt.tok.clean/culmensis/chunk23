   it 's not about the language , it 's about the cross on the flag http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_flags_depicting_a_cross what is wrong with hungary ? 
  is it derogatory for you to mention the common heritage ? 
   it seems that poland had a lot of policies targeting russia in the past , at the time of prometeism there was no russia - it was ussr . 
  imho it is appreciated how one can balance between concepts of russia and ussr . 
  when ussr could be described in good way - then it is called russia , when bad - ussr . 
  on the other hand - it is bad idea to excuse todays imperialistic policy performed by russia by compare it to former movements of other countries . 
  it is so called ' [ whataboutism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) ' or ' [ and you are lynching negroes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) ' rethoric . 
  for me you are our neighbours . 
  if not direct neighbours from behind the wall then neighbours living on the same floor in one block . 
  there are presidential election at november in belarus . 
  and this is obviously a pr work - to get rid of all the opponents and convince the public to vote for him , 
   nobody ever apologized for it officially . 
   [ the pastoral letter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_of_reconciliation_of_the_polish_bishops_to_the_german_bishops ) of the polish bishops to their german brothers was a pastoral letter ** sent on 18 november 1965 ** by polish bishops of the roman catholic church to their german counterparts . 
  it was foremost an invitation to the 1000 year anniversary celebrations of poland 's christianization in 966 . 
  in this invitation letter the bishops asked for cooperation not only with catholics but with protestants as well . 
   while recalling past and recent historical events , ** the bishops stretched out their hands in forgiveness and are asking for forgiveness ** . 
  here referred to as letter of reconciliation of the polish bishops to the german bishops it is actually only one part of the extensive groundbreaking invitation and letter , where they declared : ** `` we forgive and ask for forgiveness '' ** ( for the crimes of world war ii ) . 
  however they are priests - and you know - behave like this : ` if anyone slaps you on the right cheek , turn to them the other cheek also ' . 
  for me crimes committed by germans and german expulsion - these things are just not comparable . 
  would be interesting to compare these data with data on the proportion of elderly people in nursing homes . 
  russians in the comments do not share the same point of view . 
  yeah , how about yes . 
  and todays belarus is a bigger part of gdl which was in commonwealth . 
  but this time without kulturkampf , lebensraum and all that stuff ... 
  why not ? 
  belarus and ukraine - just like in old good times , 
  once i was surprised when englishman asked me about waleza - it took awhile that i comprehend that he was talking about wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  if \u017byli\u0144ski would pronounce his name in pure polish no english citizen would understand that . 
  our names exist in different , own versions in english language environment . 
  he speaks proper polish on beyond average level of polish citizen . 
  yes - in my case , the hot water for washing is supplied by the utility company . 
  the same company also provides hot water to the heaters in the winter . 
  euro fluctuates over a dozen years in the area of 4 z\u0142 but it is not pegged to the euro . 
  my bad - fixed it - ty . 
  btw - euro is dropping and today it 's almost equal 4 z\u0142 . 
  i 'm looking at my bill and it seems quite complicated . 
  there are few positions that correspond to water ( for one month ) : 1 . sewage : 5.49 z\u0142 / m ^ 3 2 . abonament : 18.32 z\u0142 / apartment 3 . heating water - fixed costs : 0.41 z\u0142 / m ^ 2 of housing area 4 . heating water : 11.9 z\u0142 / m ^ 3 5 . cold water : 5.51 z\u0142 / m ^ 3 1 euro = 4 z\u0142, 
  let me be politically incorrect :  may this blessed celebration of easter bring you faith , hope , love and joy . 
  greet the miracle of jesus 's resurrection with joy and happiness !, 
  stolen from comments below the article :  over only a sandwich ? 
  at least with jeremy it was over a steak . 
  it 's great that you keep your traditions alive . 
  before 1989 we can not talk about it . 
  now it seems that the pendulum of emotions is heavily tilted . 
  i hope that it is maximum maximorum . 
  these seem to be based on personal memories . 
  on the other hand it depends how you define ` more bloody and cruel ' . 
  if it could be based on number of victims , then germany wins . 
   unless you were a jew and they would kill you on the spot or drag to a concentration camp . 
  brother of my grandpa was killed by germans only becouse he was polish - during the [ inteligenzaktion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligenzaktion ) . 
  during the wwii 6.000.000 polish citizens was killed in total . 
  3.000.000 jews and 3.000.000 poles . 
   show just why the polish hate the russians more than the germans . 
  we do not hate russians . 
  we hate ussr times and now we are afraid of putin taking more lands and countries under russia influence . 
  for sure germany was more bloody and cruel then russians . 
  today attitude imho is caused by the fact that under the russian occupation ( til 1989 ) there was forbidden to mention about it . 
  nowadays germany seems to be sorry about the past , but russians want us to be only grateful for ` liberation ' . 
  and funny fact - if we are talking about terror then red army was international , but when we are talking about liberation it seems to be russian . 
  in my opinion , such questions and such as these - if czech republic is the first world country , whether estonia is a nordic etc. 
  are just pathetic . 
  some pride , ladies and gentlemen . 
  let us work and maybe we will see a time when germans will send a post in every week if we see them finally as central europe ( or even east ) . 
  i hope that soon we will be able to welcome ukraine into the eu . 
  good luck . 
  i do remember . 
  we are talking about  soviets were raping and plundering whole villages in poland generalisation . 
  mass rapes occurred during the second crossing of the red army and were related mainly to the german minority women . 
   because no one talks about rape in family idiot . 
  please do not use argumentum ad personal . 
  it could be true , but they talked about soldiers checking their house - for example . 
  if it would be rape they probably will not talk at all or with negative emotions . 
  i can talk only about my family and friends . 
  no one was raped by russians and i do n't know anybody which parents or grandparents was raped . 
  on the other hand many russians were killed in my town while fighting with germans . 
   making us weaker than western europe for next tens years that is true . 
  on the other hand - once i found english-polish translation that could be read in the same way without translation - using pie language words . 
  it was understand by polish and understand by english with the same words . 
  just like ` bubble ' and ` bulwa ' , ` son ' or ` syn ' etc. 
  do you remember something like that ? 
  looking for eternal meaning of words is what i really like . 
  thank you . 
  welcome to / r/europe - please stay with us . 
  i have n't the courage to write about it . 
  i was trying to find a protoindoeuropean root for that is common for our languages . 
  then realised , that it was after columbus  . 
  anyway - bulv\u0117 - sounds simillar like ` bulwa ' in polish and that means : bulge , bump , outgrowth , excrescence , swelling , thickening , swelling . 
   we welcome austrians sounds dengerous ... 
  i have never heard or read such opinions - maybe i 'm using different side of internet  . 
   all the polish armchair generals claiming poland should stick with putin and try to grab some western ukraine as well . 
  have you heard such opionions ? 
  there are two different things - volhynia and support for ukrainian struggle . 
  volhynia was a big tragedy and it is hard to avoid such opinions . 
  on the other hand comments are dominated by aggressive trolls and imho russians bots . 
  it depends on the website too . 
  imho in all countries that were under russian occupation or were in their ` sphere of influence ' were strong independent movements , uprisings and struggles - such as hungarian revolution 1956 , prague spring , solidarity movement , or romanian revolution . 
  i do not want to talk in the name of others , but for me the ukrainian maidan reminded all the struggles that was taken in poland between 1945 and 1989 and i feel only solidarity with their struggle of exiting of russian ` sphere of influence ' . 
   they : * panic in eyes * ... nie nie nie ... * wild hand gesticulation * yes - we have inferiority complex and we are trying to explain even if we do not know the language - using the body language . 
  on the other hand - when i was in markets in former east germany - and trying to buy the cream for the coffie - and trying to ask the stuff in the cash if it was a sugar , salt or cream box - they pretend to do not understad - just ` ja , ja , und schnell ' stuf . 
  or france and china ,
