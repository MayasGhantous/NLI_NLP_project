   again , not applicable as we are talking about humans . 
  why not ? 
  because of [ central limit theorem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_limit_theorem ) . 
  yes - there was no poland :(, 
  [ heinz guderian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinz_guderian ) was born in my town - che\u0142mno ( kulm or culm ) . 
  you said :  their is substantial evidence of polish peasants and villagers rounding up local jews and denouncing jews without any direct orders from german authorities to do so . 
  perhaps in the cities it was a bit different . 
  it is not a generalization ? 
  from your source : john connelly quoted a polish historian ( leszek gondek ) calling the phenomenon of polish collaboration `` marginal '' and wrote that `` only relatively small percentage of polish population engaged in activities that may be described as collaboration when seen against the backdrop of european and world history '' the secound one is telling story of one village . 
  even if it is true , it is hard to extrapolate it to whole society . 
   large enough amount of people took part in the holocaust and contributed to it without any germans demanding them to do so . 
   their are instances in rural southern poland where the germans were not even there yet or had given orders but the citizens handed over jews to german authorities . 
   is substantial evidence of polish peasants i agree that it is complex , but please take a reponsibility for your statements and please answer : what does it mean ` substantial ' ? 
  what percentage of polish population are you talking about ? 
   is substantial evidence of polish peasants what does it mean ` substantial ' ? 
  what percentage of polish population are you talking about ? 
  i think it is quite easy to draw conclusions based on today 's standards . 
  please remember , that for helping jews , germans killed poles and used a collective responsibility . 
  sorry for question , but what would you do today , if there would be a terror in your city and you and your familiy could be killed becouse one of your neighbour is keeping ` illegal ' emigrants ? 
  i 'm not excuse these people , but it is tough question . 
  despite of that many poles helped jews . 
  some estimates put the number of poles involved in rescue at up to 3 million , and credit poles with saving up to around [ 450,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rescue_of_jews_by_poles_during_the_holocaust ) jews from certain death . 
  for helping jews germans pacified whole villages and killed it 's residents - including women and children : cisie , hucisko , ob\u00f3rki , paulin\u00f3w , etc. 
  several thousand poles were killed for helping jews . 
  please do not forget about it . 
   wiped out in poland wiped out in german-occupied poland . 
  ftfy . 
  for me constant accusation of poles that refused to integrate jews in their society for centuries is just unfair . 
  there were two parties of such process and talking only about one side is wrong , even without giving the context . 
  where did i justify oppression ? 
   next you 'll be telling us please try to not use stereotypes . 
  it seems , that i was put in the box with ` racist , anti-semite , killer , bully , oppresor ' caption - literally hitler , that would like to burn some gypsy , black , gay , etc. 
   if a russian ever said something so starkly anti semitic , 3 . 
  let 's make an experience - try to find some citation , or use mine and put it in some discussion - we will see ( using russian , or other eu country flare ) . 
  probably yes - process of up ( down ) voting is to some extend , correlated with the flare . 
  opinion of russians my not be popular here - probably because of the ukraine stuff , etc. 
  but for sure opinion of poles are not at the top of this ranking . 
  are you serious ? 
  how citing the jew author describing facts can be anti-semite and neo-nazi ? 
  jews in poland , for many centuries , lived mostly separately in getthos , did not consider themselves polish and refused to assimilate . 
  [ isaac singer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isaac_bashevis_singer ) - the jewish author and nober price winner , wrote in forverts about pre iiww jews in poland : ` rarely did a jew think it was necessary to learn polish ; rarely was a jew interested in polish history or polish politics . 
  ( ... ) even in the last few years it was still a rare occurrence that a jew would speak polish well . 
  out of three million jews living in poland , two-and-a-half million were not able to write a simple letter in polish and they spoke very poorly . 
  there are hundreds of thousands of jews in poland to whom polish was as unfamiliar as turkish . 
  the undersigned was connected with poland for generations , but his father did not know more than two words in polish . 
  and it never even occurred to him that there was something amiss in that . ', 
  do your really need all of that slavs , italians and hungarians ? 
  you are german and you can easier join to germany . 
  after the 1st ww the czechs had a ` dobr\u00fd voj\u00e1k \u0160vejk a jin\u00e9 podivn\u00e9 historky ' and poles had a ' [ c.k. 
  dezerterzy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmef_8my46w ) ' . 
  there was a banned and popular song in post-war poland : ` truman truman dump this pumpkin ( a-bomb ) because it is unbearable ' ( ` truman truman zrzu\u0107 ta bania bo tu jest nie do wytrzymania ' ) . 
  yet another joke party that has support at the level below triple of standard error deviation . 
  never heard of it . 
  are not you afraid that articulating of such views , you will become a dissident and at the end you will have to leave russia ? 
   i agree that is great . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak_invasion_of_poland_ ( 1939 \\ ) ) fact is not mentioned in polish schools and is not widely known for society . 
  be careful - due to globalization and costs cutting , polish plumbers may be employed as donors . 
  you are risking that after few years a bunch of young people will knock at your door asking for alimony . 
   racism against russian-lithuanians xenophobia - ftfy . 
  and haste makes waste . 
  a little bit unreliable - google translate should work too ... for me it works quite well when i translate comments from - for example - delfi.lt . 
  let 's say it was a test , 
  great idea , but it may scary people that are not too sure about their english . 
  imho , you can start your mission from sending pm ( s ) . 
   and recognizes marriages performed abroad . 
  for real - in israel you have only the regligious marriages . 
  you can marriage in jew , druze , christian or muslim law . 
  civilians one are forbidden unless the both part are registered as officially not belonging to any religion . 
  strange in criterion of eu customs ? 
  they want gender equality - so let them die in equal way . 
  without crying crocodile tears because of men death . 
  why ? 
  no one will kill you . 
   our graves were destroyed and our people expelled . 
  do not be exagerated . 
  my mother family is german . 
  and i was talking about graves of polish citizens killed by german neighbours . 
   you have to stop looking thank you for lecture , but we were talking about pre wwii period , i suppose . 
  are you trying to justify the whole germans aggression ? 
  that is just sad - man . 
  you have no sources , you have only ` friend of my friend grandpa said ' statements that grows to ` whole village massacre ' . 
  come to poland , see the graves , hear the people , read sources - be open . 
  and god bless you . 
   germans were killed just because they were germans and to make place for the poles and czechs . 
  \\ sources ? 
   that is the same thing you blame the nazis for . 
  if i would blame that would be the 6.000.000 citizens . 
   i 've got a friend whose grandfather was killed in the early 30 's . 
  that is not ` whole german villages ' is not it ? 
  give some reliable sources . 
  but for real - my grandgrandpa was killed by germans neighbours - here : http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zbrodnia_w_mniszku, 
   whole german villages were massacred by poles and czechs before the nazis in germany even gained power where ? 
    killed because of nationality or shape of skull or just wipe off to give some space to ubermensch ? 
   you just supported my argument . 
  that 's what poles , czechs and russians have done to germans . 
  what to hell are you talking about ? 
   tell that to my grandparents who owned multiple apartment blocks and got nothing of their existence back just because they happened to speak german . 
  tell that to my grandparents who were polish and were murdered by german neighbours just because they were polish . 
   what the czechs , poles and russians did was nothing short of what the nazis have done , i view their actions with the same disgust . 
  really ?
