  they gassed people ? 
  killed because of nationality or shape of skull or just wipe them off to give some space to ubermensch ? 
  you mean free from the 5-th column and ordinary murderers - just like [ volksdeutscher selbentschutz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksdeutscher_selbstschutz ) ? 
  germans were lucky that czechs , poles , belorussians etc. 
  were humans that did not take their right to revenge . 
  if they behave like germans - every one would be hang on . 
  you know - sometimes it is hard to apology . 
  every family in poland has a member that was killed by germans . 
  in my family granpa was killed by his german neighbours ( [ selbstschutz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksdeutscher_selbstschutz ) ) during the [ intelligenzaktion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligenzaktion ) . 
  wife of brother of my other grandpa was forced to [ work in german farm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forced_labour_under_german_rule_during_world_war_ii ) as a slave . 
  except beating , she survived . 
  not mentioning the terror etc. 
  imho it is not fair to compare all of that things that germany did to poles to repatriation . 
  the letter sent by priests in 1965 was quite controversial - but you know - the priests . 
   [ material recompensation [ to poland ] incurred by germany has been estimated as approximately $ 525 billion or $ 640 billion in 2004 exchange values . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reparations_for_world_war_ii#poland ) it is estimated value of compensation , which germany did ** not ** paid , herr panzerfaust . 
  see the source from your link . 
  it seems that her father was very good , human and sympathetic owner . 
   has the government ? 
  have they given , or even offered , compensation ? 
  that is interesting question . 
  as far as i remember there was some events described in our newspapers about german claims and some properties was given to them . 
  from the other hand there was no compensation for death of 6 polish citizens , stolen and destroyed cultural goods , cities and villages . 
  maybe it is a good idea to count that , estimate the value and make some payments . 
   for which they mostly have not yet apologized . 
  in 1965 polish bishops sent a [ pastoral letter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_of_reconciliation_of_the_polish_bishops_to_the_german_bishops ) to their german counterparts . 
  while recalling past and recent historical events , the bishops stretched out their hands in forgiveness and are asking for forgiveness , where they declared : `` we forgive and ask for forgiveness '' ( for the crimes of world war ii ) . 
   to wipe out a people . 
  there was massive movement of people according their nationality after the wwii . 
  it concerned not only germans . 
  [ the polish population transfers from the former eastern territories of poland , also known as the expulsion of poles from the kresy regions , [ 1 ] towards the end -- and in the aftermath -- of world war ii , refer to the forced migrations of poles occurring between 1944 -- 1946 . 
  it was an official soviet policy which targeted ** over a million polish citizens ** . 
  they were removed from the polish areas annexed by the soviet union , which were incorporated into the ukrainian , belarusian and lithuanian ssr following the tehran conference of 1943 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_population_transfers_ ( 1944 % e2 % 80 % 9346 \\ ) ) after that the second repatriation started : [ repatriation of polish population in the years of 1955 -- 1959 ( also known as the second repatriation , [ 1 ] to distinguish it from the first repatriation in the years 1944-1946 ) was the second wave of forced repatriation ( in fact , deportation ) of the poles living in the territories annexed by the soviet union ( see kresy wschodnie ) . 
  it should be stressed that the widely used term repatriation , promoted by decades of polish communist propaganda , is a kind of manipulation and refers to an act of illegal expatriation . 
  [ 2 ] in the aftermath of the death of joseph stalin and the start of destalinization , ** about 250,000 people were repatriated , including about 25,000 political prisoners from the gulags ** . 
  notable poles repatriated during that time include czes\u0142aw niemen , w\u0142adys\u0142aw kozakiewicz , lew rywin and anna seniuk . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/repatriation_of_poles_ ( 1955 % e2 % 80 % 9359 \\ ) ), 
   because they were polish-lithuanian in poland only the people connected with communist party , officers , and militants were privileged . 
  do i understand well that in lithuania people were privileged because of the nationality ? 
  if so , could you give me some examples ? 
  never heard about that and just curious . 
   eventually , it is the taxpayers money :( it is not big deal in polish news . 
  from what i googled ( in polish ) , hungary after supporting russians , will achieve : cheaper gas prices . 
  12 mld euro loan for building the nuclear plant . 
  http://m.interia.pl/biznes/news,2099286,4199 russia will get rid of the embargo for food from hungary . 
  what is the purpose ? 
  imho it is the question - why do they going here . 
  i really believe that some of them are war refugees . 
  but imho most of them are just people that want a better live . 
  the reason that attract them is the easy-get goods : pocket-money , free housing and eternal subsidies . 
  i really believe that competition between sweden and denmark has no sense . 
  your both countries gives comparable goods for that people . 
  however is trying to take some goods from refugees - probably for pr goals and to calm down domestic people . 
  but the problem lies in the amount of that goods . 
  for you it is just fair amount . 
  for us it is big money . 
  for them it is fortune . 
  and this is the problem . 
  this is the magnet that attract most of that people . 
  why just not to answer the question : what real refugees needs ? 
  imho it is shelter , food and water . 
  nothing more . 
  why do you have ambitions to give them more than for example turkey ? 
  why do you try to integrate them ? 
  they should leave denmark after war in syria will stop . 
  thank you very much . 
  i really appreciate . 
  but what do you think about this danish solutions , that we were talking about before ? 
  thank you very much . 
  i marked your nick , and i will send you all of my messages to check - on your pm - after google translate . 
  ( it 's a joke - do not worry ) . 
  if you need any help with your polish - please feel free to ask . 
  sure , every opportunity is great to learn something . 
  but if you would like to talk about this subject - please feel free - too . 
  which one of implementation of communist ideology would you like most ? 
  russian , mao 's chinese , cuba , vietnam , laos , red khmers , or today venesuela ? 
  and not once again please . 
  check it somewhere else . 
  extremism of denmark government is not dependent on the prediction of change of population projections . 
  anyway - good for you . 
  extremism in this case lays in the fact that these ` poor people ' were forced to pay for the hospitality of the danish government . 
  nowhere i met this behaviour in modern word for the acceptance of refugees . 
  i think that historically it can be compared to the time - i 'm very sorry - holocaust . 
  i know we all want to atrocity the country 's image . 
  the goal is to scary people that want to come here . 
  but excuse me - for me this behaviour is just pathology . 
  the voice of danish voters is certainly important . 
  as the voice of the people of the poorer eu countries , which can be easily used . 
   what german search engines think about europe ... if someone is offended , it is the fault of google and not ordinary germans . 
  gut . 
  exactly . 
  it is madness that only goal is to intimidate disobedient countries . 
  imho even hitler or stalin were more seating in the then applicable law . 
  i 'm not sure if i guess your true intention , but i 'm glad . 
  imho - we are united under eu by now . 
  but we are distinct in criterion of wealth . 
  wealthier countries do not recognise how real world looks like . 
  they are promissing and giving free money for every ` refugee ' . 
  with such slogans as ` open-border ' , ` equality ' etc.
