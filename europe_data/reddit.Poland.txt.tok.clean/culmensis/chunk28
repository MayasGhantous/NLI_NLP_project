  imho it is more general rule . 
  edit - when allowed to kill and when obliged to rescue . 
  i 'm not sure what is the exact point in time of pregnancy dividing the period when you can easily kill or should have saved a life . 
  what is your opinion dear / r/europe ` nians ? 
  was his life worth to spend all the money , or should he be just aborted ? 
  it 's time to reduce the number of police officers . 
  there are some roma families in my region . 
  you can spot the same faces in crowd . 
  it 's hard to say if they are integrated . 
  they usually speaking in polish with accent . 
  women usually wearing long skirts and making palmistry . 
  but at least they do not burn open fires in their houses . 
   the commies deported most of them from poland . 
  never heard . 
  have you any sources ? 
  in polish slang ' [ feta ] ( http://www.miejski.pl/slowo-feta ) ' means also amphetamine . 
   that is why sweden is so prosperous compared to countries like poland . 
  last war for sweden was in 1814 . 
  if you would like to compare and draw any conclusions with the situation in other european countries . 
  and by the way - the wwii time was a great opportunity to get rich for sweden , while people in poland were exterminated . 
  this sub is famous for extreme censorship and extreme left-wing propaganda . 
   to teaching kids `` the zionist presence of the root of all evil , and exterminating it is the goal of islam '' few first search from youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9bxevpgyhg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuu05ej4le0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5168ysq2ru https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fdxqgtdsf0 it seems that existence of israel is based on hate . 
  catholics and anti-abortion movement too ? 
   but now that pis officials are openly insulting obama for being black we went back to square 0 . 
  what ? 
  no - it is like ` v ' . 
  just another oportunity . 
  former union of czech and slovakia . 
  no - it was quite sophisticated kind of humour compared to this one . 
  it is forgotten . 
  russian by themselves distinguish the ` rusky ' and ` russian ' words too . 
  the first is a white slav with russian roots and the second is more generally citizen of russia . 
  edit : in russian language : ` rusky ' and ` rossiyskiy ' in english : ` rusky ' and ` russian ' . 
  in polish : litwa ( litua ) . 
  in you language it sounds like lietuwa ( lyetuva ) . 
  am i right ? 
  but imho more rude and , well - ` special ' . 
  i was trying to find funny pictures or memes with erdogan in polish internet - without results . 
  but if you are trying to find something simmilar to b\u00f6hmermann poems :  dumb , cowardly and inhibited ,  is erdogan , the president . 
   his dick ugly smells like kebap ,  even pig farts are better . 
   he is the man who punshes women ,  and wears while doing , a mask of gummi . 
   his favorite is to fuck goats ,  as well as supress minorities . 
   kick kurds , beat up christs ,  while watching porn of kids . 
   in the evening instead of sleep ,  fellatio with a hundred sheep . 
   yes , erdogan stout and rout ,  is a president with a small dick . 
  it would be rather hard . 
  ok . you are right  ^ but ^ we ^ all ^ know ^ that ^ it ^ is ^ one ^ . 
  one . 
  and we had common border before wwii . 
  we can also see romania from poland : https://np.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/3zemnj/hey_romania_we_can_see_you/, 
  a step in the right direction . 
  we should strengthen relations with romania . 
  we 're almost neighbors and we know quite poorly . 
  please be a little more tolerant of groups that have their own believes and rules . 
  hail to the mieszko i and to his bloody son . 
   is it a good thing ? 
  at that time it was like accesion to the eu . 
  hard to judge , there were many pros and cons , but imho it was the best move . 
  there is no complexes for soviet scientists . 
  the reality looked like [ this ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=shtetl+1930&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) . 
  most of the polish jews in poland was orthodox religious - just like [ haredim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haredi_judaism ) in todays israel . 
  and we had at that time the same stereotypes about them as todays citizens of israel about their haredim . 
  your citation does not prove it . 
  and i never heard of it . 
  i like reading and have read many books about it - also jewish authors . 
  and it was not mentioned . 
  please find exact quotation that proves your claims . 
  i assure you that polish perception of jews before wwii was that they were poor . 
  the german posters from that time cant come from nowhere . 
  we are not talking about stereotype . 
  we are talking about your perception of jews in poland before wwii . 
   jews owned most businesses and poles were working for them for peanuts in their own country . 
  while the truth is that most of the jews in poland were poor . 
  quite impresive number but it would be interesting to compare it to total number of businesses . 
  you are trying to tell me what perception of jews was in poland ? 
  based on charlie chaplin movie ? 
  you can see the typical jewish towns in poland by googling ` shtetl 1930 ' . 
   i 'm surprised that people do n't know this . 
  the polish stereotype of a jew is a small-business owner who 's out to scam you . 
  you edited your post after my response . 
  this was no stereotype :  poverty was acute among polish jews , who had among the highest rates of natural increase in europe and were often unable to feed their children . 
  [ 4 ] after the peace treaty of riga , the already numerous jewish minority of the second polish republic was joined by several hundred thousand refugees escaping pogroms in the east . 
  more than 75 per cent of them lived in the urban areas , with higher than average number of women , children and the elderly . 
  [ 5 ] poland was struggling with remnants of devastating economic exploitation by the partitioners and their ensuing trade embargos ( see also : german -- polish customs war ) . 
  new job opportunities were mostly nonexistent before poland 's industrialization of the mid-1930s -- although jewish per capita income among the working population was more than 40 % higher in 1929 than that of polish non-jews . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] the impoverished families relied on local jewish charity , which had reached universally unprecedented proportions in 1929 , providing services such as religion , education , health and other services to the amount of 200 million z\u0142oty a year . 
  [ 10 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poverty_in_poland, 
  ` sometimes ' and ' majority of retail businesses ' is not the same as  jews owned most businesses do n't you think so ? 
  it is not used in context that they were overseers in getto . 
  they could be for example overseers in work places outside the getto . 
  hard to believe - please put the whole citation from this book . 
  there is a rumor in russia that rasputin was a grandpa of current president . 
  any russian can confirm ? 
   jews owned most businesses just find one . 
   i suspect polish antipathy towards the jews had a lot to do with the fact that at the time jews owned most businesses and poles were working for them for peanuts in their own country . 
  any sources for this ? 
  i 'm not asking about a particular cases but statistical . 
  there were integrated rich jews at that time but most of them were poor . 
  and they were not integrated and barely speak polish - after few hundreds years of living in polish soil . 
   and they `` employed '' poles as overseers , meaning they were to be in charge of picking out the jews to be sent to the concentration camps first or just keeping an eye on them so their conditions would be sufficiently bad .
