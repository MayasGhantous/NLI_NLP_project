  what are you talking about ? 
  poles were overseers in gettos ? 
  where are you get it from ? 
  gettos had their own autonomy . 
  they had the [ judenrat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judenrat ) and [ jewish police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_ghetto_police ) . 
  you can find information who was preparing the proscription lists in many books and articles . 
  you may read hannah arendt 's ` eichmann in jerusalem ' :  `` to a jew , this role of the jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter of the whole dark story . 
  [ ... ] in the matter of cooperation , there was no distinction between the highly assimilated jewish communities of central and western europe and the yiddish-speaking masses of the east . 
  in amsterdam as in warsaw , in berlin as in budapest , jewish officials could be trusted to compile the lists of persons and of their property ... '' or people like [ chaim rumkowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaim_rumkowski ) that ordered jews in lodz getto to send their own children to auschwitz . 
  it was irony showing the lack of common sense of this assumptions . 
  plust the 10 % - why not 20 or 1 ? 
  [ it 's just a prank bro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbekpnwbl5k ) . 
  the number of jews killed by poles is estimated . 
  different authors cite different numbers . 
  jewish scietists cite a number from 100 to 200 thousand . 
  according to him , the source is the book of persak , who accepted that 10 % of jews fled from the ghettos . 
  in the ghettos under the [ operation reinhard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_reinhard ) lived 1.6 million jews . 
  escaped by 160,000 ( 10 % ) . 
  40,000 survived . 
  what conclusions ? 
  the rest - 120,000 were murdered . 
  by whom ? 
  of course , the poles . 
  according to me , these estimates are unreliable and biased scientific method . 
  i never said that it is ok what pis had done . 
  but i can see the difference with treating the same behaviour of different parties . 
  the previous government started the mess with this concept of democracy principles , but no one at that time was protesting . 
  for me it is hypocrisy . 
   in russia they have polonium . 
  according to [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro_health_consumer_index )  the index was criticised in the british medical journal by martin mckee and others from the european observatory on health systems and policies in february 2016 . 
  points they made included :  the index is constructed by scoring performance as good , intermediary or not-so-good , based on arbitrary cut-off points . 
   there is no logic in how many points are allocated to each indicator . 
  225 points are allocated to accessibility , but only 250 to health outcomes . 
   the indicators are a mix of trends over time and cross-sectional rankings . 
  imho hard to believe that we are so low . 
  in 2014 we were a little bit higher . 
  7 and 25 was achieved long time ago . 
  do not you have considered to have bigger lucky numbers ? 
  prime ones seems to be interesting . 
  7 , 25 , 78 , 1527 - what is the number in your oppinion , that would trigger you ? 
  not exact ` annex ' , but military intervene to keep puppet governments in : hungary 56 , czechoslovakia 68 , afghanistan 1979 and probably more . 
  every country should vote for common good as a main goal , but it is good to have you on our side . 
  just wonder what would do previous government in such a situation . 
  hard to believe . 
  during communist time it were sophisticated rules and unwritten law for queing - for example we had something like [ ` komitet kolejkowy ' or ` lista kolejkowa ' ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lista_kolejkowa ) - a form of social self-organized queue list - to arrange the queue . 
  what we are doing wrong ? 
  paradoxically , if not for hitler , there would be no israel . 
   i expected something like london . 
  if you mean general outlook and feeling , i strongly recommend [ islamabad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamabad ) or [ dhaka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dhaka ) . 
  i 'm not a historian and this is my opinion based only on primary and secondary history education . 
  you can compare all parts of partitioned poland in different criterions . 
  the criterion of money and development - the part of poland taken by germans was the best . 
  the criterion of anti-polish mood , forced polonisation etc. 
  - your part and russian part were the best . 
  especially during the bismarck rule . 
  habsburgs treated as quite fair , but we were at the end of their empire , separated by tatra mountains , without investments and modern industry - thus poor . 
  i cant find an article , but some time ago i read about this phenomena . 
  it is not true , as you can see . 
  we do not hate you . 
  the issue was caused by a chinese blog that use the phrase that poles hate chinese and your search engine baidu used it to autocomplete with the poland word . 
  not true imho . 
  the ` roma ' word is pc version of commonly used ` cygan ' in polish language . 
  it was not used in 90 ' . 
  and that was the decade when we had a big influx of them . 
  hard to guess . 
  we had many minorities that integrated well . 
  in my part of poland many people have german names but they consider themself polish . 
  according to [ israel shahak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israel_shahaks ) ` jewish history , jewish religion : the weight of three thousand years ' it was mainly caused by the exclusivism of the religion . 
  he gives many examples . 
  the one that comes in to my mind is that jews needed to live in the same area to move freely at sabat . 
  and before wwii many jews in poland were religious . 
   poland had huge jewish population well integrated into polish society on every level . 
  unfortunately you could be wrong . 
  there were some jews well integrated and participating in polish culture and science , but most of them seemed not to be . 
  in an article entitled , `` jews and poles lived together for 800 years but were not integrated , '' published in forverts ( new york , september 17 , 1944 ) , yiddish author and nobel laureate isaac bashevis singer wrote :  rarely did a jew think it was necessary to learn polish ; rarely was a jew interested in polish history or polish politics . 
  ... even in the last few years it was still a rare occurrence that a jew would speak polish well . 
  out of three million jews living in poland , two-and-a-half million were not able to write a simple letter in polish and they spoke [ polish ] very poorly . 
  there are hundreds of thousands of jews in poland to whom polish was as unfamiliar as turkish . 
  the undersigned was connected with poland for generations , but his father did not know more than two words in polish . 
  and it never even occurred to him that there was something amiss in that . 
  it was after hundreds years of our coexistation . 
  yes it is . 
  [ mandatory picture ] ( http://intfolder.ucoz.com/photo/cute_and_adorable/how_cute_and_adorable/19-0-1581 ), 
  imho the reason is political correctness of polish journalists . 
  they are ( were ) describing issues with romanian roma as ` romanians ' . 
  for many people the ` romanian ' and ` roma ' are synonyms . 
  thus this connotation . 
  it is the matter of few last years that people put attention to distinguish . 
  on the other hand - we do not know each other well - as other bordering countries . 
  imho it is unfair . 
   why do you assume it will have to end ? 
  because everything has it 's own end . 
  i would like to see ukraine taking their former parts . 
  but imho it would not happen . 
  anyway in the current circumstances . 
  outside courage arising from treaties signed hidden behind of personal attacks captured with the old man ? 
   and while poland is since joining the no . 
  2 when it comes to eating out of the eu agriculture budget , please compare it with per capita criterion - we are quite a big country . 
  and consider that our donations in agriculture were at the start 1/4 of [ western donations ] ( http://www.naszdziennik.pl/mysl/54253,siedem-bardzo-chudych-lat.html ) . 
  the rest i agree .
