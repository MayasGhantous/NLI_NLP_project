  especially support from france ? 
  what are you talking about - have you got some examples ? 
  and yes - there is old polish proverb - if you can count , count on yourserlf . 
   anyway , i do like poland and polish ( i just think your politics demand a bit to much without prividing anything ) and especially how you seems to be optimistic about the futur . 
  if this is not irony , cynicism , mockery or sarcasm , it seems to be so-called conditional liking . 
  the old polish proverb says , it is better to pass such friends first . 
  10 liters of water , 4 kg of sugar , some yeasts . 
  then waiting for a few weeks and distille . 
  and more seriously - in a communist poland moonshine was quite popular - because of the restrictions on alcohol . 
  and you , how do you deal ? 
  i like this accent ... every word is separated and easy to understand . 
  learn how to speak english all of you : irish , scots , etc. 
  we have big families , children , friends and a lot of work to do . 
  and we do not have to watch ~ ~ porn ~ ~ internet everyday or almost every day . 
  sorry - i do not know your history . 
  i know nokkia for today and swamp defence in 39 . 
  please tell me your history in few sentences . 
  from beggining to today period . 
  i would not like to read whole stories on wiki and tones of links - just few sentences . 
  i partly have german origin . 
  now i know that this genotype is very strong . 
  or in orphanages , families , schools or streets - just not to be so biased . 
  i do now want to defend any such of ` natural ' behaviour . 
  but you must agree , that it exists parts of animmal life that is worth of seeing and part that is not . 
  we can with all of our families go to see animal mother parenting her young - it is nice and hartworming , but mother eating her youngs is beyound our experience . 
  we can see people saving animals and we are feeling proud . 
  from the other hand - milions of cows , pigs , chikens , fishes are killed everyday . 
  for us it is just another box in fridge in supermarkets . 
  annimals behaviours is much and much far avay from our life today . 
  depends on the definition of prude . 
  we are not going to zoo with our childred and paing for tickets to to see the animals procreaction acts . 
  we do not have to . 
  we have relatives in our countryside - birds and butterflies to explain how it works . 
  how it is with average italian ? 
  do you must taking your childred to zoo to see the fucking animals like elephants and donkeys to explain what is life ? 
  from the other hand - imho this napoleon is addicted to sex and anasthasia is just jet another female sex addicted . 
  hope so . 
  good luck for all of us !, 
  better not necessarily implies good , 
  old good c2h5oh . 
  which implementation of communist ideology do you like most : 1 . 
  soviet ( 20 mln victims ) 2 . 
  chinese ( 65 ) 3 . 
  north korea ( 2 ) 5 . 
  east ( cetral ) europe ( 1 ) 6 vietnam ( 1 ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_black_book_of_communism, 
  there is the story that the polish prince leszek bia\u0142y ( the white ) ( 1186-1227 ) [ once explained to the pope that polish knights could not participate in his crusade , because there was no mead or beer to be had in palestine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leszek_i_the_white ) . 
  pope [ innocent iii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pope_innocent_iii ) gave him a dispensation from taking part in the crusades . 
  edit : fixed date of death . 
  thank you for information . 
  i used to use saint names to translate to other languages . 
  in this case i took the saint laszlo i. 
  in this case russia wiki gives [ \u041b\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9b%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%bb%d0%be_i_%d0%a1%d0%b2%d1%8f%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b9 ) . 
   how do french people pronounce nathan ? 
  just like nathan but without ` h ' . 
   the most common male name in hungary is l\u00e1szl\u00f3 , female is m\u00e1ria . 
  translating names : maria is obvious . 
  laszlo is : belarussian , russian : \u041b\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e , czech : ladislav , english , german , spanish : ladislaus , polish : w\u0142adys\u0142aw it seems that etymology comes from slavic languages and it means : w\u0142ad ( from ` w\u0142ada\u0107 ' - manage ) and slaw ( from 's \u0142awa ' - glory ) : summa summarum : w\u0142adys\u0142aw aka l\u00e1szl\u00f3 means ` gloroius '  considering the most popular hungarian surname : nagy ( tall ) - the nagy l\u00e1szl\u00f3 would be in polish : w\u0142adys\u0142aw wysocki . 
  and now for something completely different : ` w\u0142adys\u0142aw ' name in polish is used only for official purposes . 
  during more familiar events there are used diminutives such as : ` w\u0142adek ' , ` w\u0142odek ' , ` w\u0142adziu ' and after some drinks even : ` dzidek ' . 
   mohammed for instance was more used in 2012 in the netherlands than daan . 
  is it good , bad or you do not care about it ? 
  so what is the solution for poland , ukraine , baltic states , etc. 
  in this case ? 
  wait and let do bigger countries do what ever their want ? 
  through this olive skin turks are easily identifiable in a single ethnically poland . 
  i often see groups of turkish men students wandering around in my town like no purpose . 
  wandering so in his uniform gender groups from the first to the fifth year of study and then suddenly leaving . 
  this case refers to the russians attitude to their communist past . 
  is this more important to them , that during communism , millions of russians and citizens of other nations lost their lives during the bloody terror created by lenin and dzerzhinsky , or that at that time the whole world was afraid of them and the russians were ` respected ' . 
  in this case putin imho shows what is more important . 
  perhaps . 
  it 's hard for me to believe that putin would made such a move without taking into account public sentiment . 
  especially in such a trivial matter . 
  so why putin renames that unit ? 
   does poland like any non-anglo country ? 
  hungary . 
   i suppose stalin is also responsible for the ethnic cleansing of slavs you are trying to be sarcastic - but please pay attention how many russians - slavs - was murdered by communists in your country and countries that you had occupied . 
  i 'm always wondered why you - russians - like and respect the most people that humiliated you , bully you and beat you up . 
  from the other hand : [ the gestapo -- nkvd conferences were a series of meetings organized in late 1939 and early 1940 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] whose purpose was to enable the german and soviet security forces ( the gestapo and nkvd respectively ) to share information regarding their operations in poland . 
  in spite of their differences on other issues , both heinrich himmler and lavrentiy beria had common purposes as far as the fate of poland was concerned , [ 3 ] and the conferences discussed coordinating plans for occupation of the polish nation and in fighting the polish resistance movement , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] which was an irritant to both nazi and soviet occupiers of poland . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestapo%e2%80%93nkvd_conferences ), 
  despite of current mode pushed by mainstream media , one of the leader of the eu seems to be the most conservative one in this criterion as well as many other aspects . 
   lithuanian language really was introduced in xix century . 
  that is not true . 
  first written text was from xvi century , but the spoken language existed before that . 
  lithuanian language is one of the proto-indo-european language . 
  and it is one of the most conservative . 
  it means that lithuanian was less changed and [ retaining many archaic features otherwise found only in ancient languages such as sanskrit or ancient greek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_language#history ) . 
  here is the polish spelling : https://translate.google.pl/#pl/en/kie%c5%82basa just press the speaker icon in the left panel . 
  hope some day people around the world would be wonder how to spell it correctly in polish  just like espresso or suchi . 
   kovbasa kie\u0142basa , ko\u0142basa , klobasa , kobasa , kolbasi , kovbasa , kobasi , and kubasa are common names for a type of central and eastern european sausage . 
  btw in polish it is kielbasa ( kie\u0142basa ) . 
  i was trying to find the etymology ( unsuccessfully ) , but in polish it sounds like concatenating of two words : kie\u0142 ( tooth , cuspid ) and biesa ( of a devil ) . 
  there is theory that etymology of [ berlin name is slavic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin#etymology ) , but dublin ? 
  it is lack of belarus to rebirth the commonwealth, 
  imho the / u/shuai is japanese . 
  to bring the issue to your point of view = it is like kuril islands - full of russians but japanese want them in their country . 
  from the other hand - you control it by supplying water , food , gas and electricity . 
  that statement would cost you yet another submarine . 
  according to this poll : http://i.imgur.com/1k6ffbs.png poles like lithuanians .
