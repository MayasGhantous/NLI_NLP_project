  imho you overestimate us . 
  the only thing we want is respect for the law . 
  you mean the famous ` libert\u00e9 , \u00c9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 , ou la mort ' slogan that caused to death of many innocent people ? 
  the buzzwords ` liberty , equality , fraternity ' was imho stupid and mean nothing and can be use by every dictatorship . 
  the ` ou la mort ' is more interesting and it was the same as the revolution in soviet russia , chinese mao or pol pot cambodia . 
  nothing to be proud of imho . 
  on the other hand - do french state exist ? 
  who are going to protect the truck drivers and their cargo ? 
  why they allow to exists such a thing as ` jungle ' in calais ? 
  nothing new . 
  french aggresive farmers are attacking and destroying trucks from abroad - polish trucks [ too ] ( http://vod.gazetapolska.pl/10647-agresywni-francuscy-rolnicy-atakuja-polskie-tiry ) . 
  can you imagine west truck 's load destroyed in eastern europe ? 
  what is for me strange , that french police do nothing about it . 
  why do not french obey the law without any consequences ? 
  wizzair is well known . 
  but if we are talking about cuisine - for me it is goulash or letcho - it is known as hungary dish , despite that it is cooked in different ways in different countries and tokaj - especially szamorodni , which name has roots in polish language . 
  for me it is [ folk music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdbvpgyn5kq ) and irish bands - u2 , clannad , etc. 
  because it will have to be ended . 
  just wonder what would you accept . 
  sometimes i look at the ukrainian comments on websites . 
  remember , than before 2012 when we were preparing for euro 2012 sometimes ukrainians published posts that they fear a war and starvation . 
  at that time i was like wtf ? 
  war in xxi century in our part of world ? 
  well - it happened quickly . 
  anyway - best wishes for you . 
  can fellow ukrainians write how it will be finished according to you ? 
  do you expect to take back crimea ? 
  do you let the thought of federalisation or autonomy for the western areas ? 
  please do not use the catholic stereotypes . 
  it is the matter of morality and not believe . 
  i just can draw an easy conclusions that the lack of morality in czech republic is corelated to the number of porn stars per capita . 
  my opinion is just based on the same stereotypical point of view . 
   it 's stating that embryo = human from the very beginning , so human rights apply to it so - when the magic starts ? 
  what is the time that you seem the tissue as someone , as human beeing or just a buch of cells . 
  when it is the time that you can call abortion like kill someone or just abort some unwanted tissue ? 
  constitutional tribunal crisis and nationalisation of private funds were not much issues . 
  not similarly to current situation , when every fault is publicized and described in international newspapers . 
  do you need any support again ? 
  do you really think , that abortion is synonym of progressiveness , and can be used as equivalent of contraception ? 
  agree that he is not the sharpest one . 
  this is a question with a thesis . 
  did they ? 
  alienation does not have to be an intentional process . 
  in this case , imho it is the result of the obstruction of outside interests of some countries and the work of many so-called ` useful idiots ' from poland . 
  me too - i liked him as fm and a person . 
  and the joke was rude , but funny - not like all the polish jokes , 
  i 'm not defending him . 
  but for me it is quite a surprise , when former government was doing worse things and everybody was ok with that . 
   `` have you heard that obama may have a polish connection ? 
  his grandfather ate a polish missionary . '', 
  i agree that it was not the clever way to express himself , but sikorski statement was quite popular in poland and everybody in poland got this context . 
  hopefully our fm did not use another sikorski statement to describe this situation . 
  on the other hand it is pity imho , that many people , also from polish opposition , use his badly translated words without context to spread the hate to the new government in foreign newspapers . 
  it is an adjective from word ` murzyn ' and means the same as in the [ `` the moor has done his duty , the moor can go '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murzyn ) mentioned above . 
   `` the moor has done his duty , the moor can go '' exacty you are [ right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murzyn ) . 
  i agree , that fm should not use words that could be taken as controversial . 
  but imho it is not fair translation of ` murzyn ' word as 'n' word . 
  this word means in polish black person . 
  it was used in elementary children school book for [ generations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_jolf-l7ti ) . 
  it is written in our official [ dictionary of polish language ] ( http://sjp.pl/murzyn ) . 
  it 's status is comparable to gypsy vs. roma name now . 
  for me it is quite astounding that every word of our government is heard and is commented by people supporting opposition . 
  this particular wording used by our fm is taken as a citation that was quite popular in poland , from our previous fm - sikorski . 
  but at that time , no one was interested in that . 
  by the way - former fm sikorski told a joke about obama , that was much more rude . 
  are you interested ? 
  edit : in this case the best translation of ` murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 ' is the same as `` moornes '' from the `` the moor has done his duty , the moor can go '' phrase . 
  imho if the nuclear war would start in our region , all the eu will be a wasteland . 
   it is only people in the west who look for explanations elsewhere . 
  is it not the same with roma and jews ? 
   so make those consequences even worse ? 
  the logic of the religious authoritarians baffles me . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/mapeuropeabrate3big.gif ) you have the most modern countries in criterion of abortion and easy way to get rid of the ` even worse consequences ' . 
  notice that they are not religious countries . 
  so [ abortion ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/mapeuropeabrate3big.gif ) is the way to become reacher , smarter or more westerner ? 
   what the actual fuck ? 
  you should not fuck without thinking . 
  at least about consequences . 
   read my comments fully and thoroughly . 
  i 'm sure it is worth . 
  so what is the remedy for all the mess you mentioned ? 
  emergency contraception , abortion or eugenic programs ? 
   orphans and infanticide . 
   alcoholism ,  abuse or straight-out rape will happen ,  unwanted children ,  unwanted children , in environments which produce unfortunate events . 
   poor families becoming poorer , and all the remedy for all that bad is the perscription for emergency contraception . 
  do not you think that this is just biased opinion ? 
  [ just ] ( https://mindinflux.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/nazi1.jpg ) like in this poster not from far ago . 
  communists for sure were resettled and deported whole groups of people in different criterions : nation , social origin etc. 
  but for sure they would not give a smallest penny for people that do not work and do not contribute for common happiness . 
  good example , but from the not-so-far-history , the [ budapest memorandum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) signed by nuclear powers , gives ukraine guaranties to territorial integrity . 
  one can see how it ended and how much it was ( is ) worth . 
  they are white east-slave christians - they did not count . 
  i do not know about this particular 62 people , but we took some of the syrian christians . 
  they were invited by polish parishes . 
  anyway , big part of them did choose bigger free money from germany . 
  they did not say ` goodbye ' and disappeared at night . 
  polish equivalents of english proverb : ` talk of the devil -- and the devil appears ' : ` do not call the wolf out of the forest ' and ` it is better not to tempt fate ' . 
  i 'm glad of this score , but - you know ... 
   laws help a lot because they help lgbt people having the reason and the authority on their side . 
  means that they can have a life even if they have crazy parents .
