  gulags were ussr , but the victory in wwii was russian . 
   because of the fear of brown people honestly - are you a brown ? 
   i also dislike poland for it 's recent political shift . 
  before wwii poland was a bastion of democracy , standing up against facism and paying a high toll on that honourable attitude . 
  after the fall of the soviet union they have been taking in european money and now elected a right wing idiotcracy to protect them from having to participate in any kind of international affair that might costs money . 
  seriously , fuck you . 
  --  before wwii poland was a bastion of democracy , standing up against facism and paying a high toll on that honourable attitude . 
  we are doing the same now . 
  you are not . 
  you are violating the order and the law and especting other countries to do the same . 
  it is not fair and it is not at least democratic . 
  i would not like to call your behaviour idocracy - but if you wish . 
   seriously , fuck you . 
  greetings . 
   poland : fuck you [ ... ] , also fuck you , we get it , you 're the world 's biggest sufferer , oy vey , really ? 
  we are the * biggest * ? 
  do n't you forget someone ? 
  on the other hand - we have a reason . 
   now it breaks my heart we had never something like [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponary_massacre ) in our history with hungarian . 
  even if we were in different historian parts , we were always friends and loyal . 
  after falling of ussr i had always warm feelings towards you . 
  then , few years ago , after googling i found delfi.lt to see what our neighbours is thinking about us . 
  and it seems , well let 's say , that not everybody likes us . 
  but overall poles know about our common history and likes you . 
  have you watched the movie ' [ janosik ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v15ieoy5tdu ) ' ? 
  if so - what language does he speak ? 
   why do you think we have numbers printed on eggs showing whether the hen was locked in cage or wandering freerly ? 
  funny - i grew up in the countryside . 
  i remember granpa cutting off the head of the different birds . 
  now i 'm just a cityman and i 'm used to eat chicken from shops . 
  the chicken are feed with the same food , looks the same and , well ... taste the same . 
  everybody is talking about free and wandering freerly chickens , that they diffirenciate and are very tasty . 
  lastly i had an opportunity to taste that ` true ' one - first thing i thought - how many shits that chicken eat in her live and then - the taste - for me it was far more worst that one from shop . 
  it is sad . 
  i liked his ` the name of the rose ' - both both book and movie , but cant get and finish his last ` the prague cemetery ' one . 
  i see and do not want to argue , but imho quality criteria can be applied for processed products . 
  the quality of raw meat should be the same despite of producer or the place of origin - is not it ? 
  unless one is caressing pigs or feed them with special meal . 
  in this case it was more about prices than quality imho . 
  you may say i 'm a dreamer , but they showed how to fight for free trade . 
  respect for them and let them buy whatever they want from poland . 
  exactly , it is not our - polish - bussines . 
  customer is king . 
  imho we can blame the media political correctness . 
  in poland we had influx of roma people from romania some years ago . 
  all the newspapers and other media when some crimes were mentioned , were called them romanian . 
  the same situation was in belgium when a roma teen kill a man for a walkman - international media were writing about a polish man . 
   but what do you think should be done about it ? 
  some time ago i red an interview or watched footage with an old roma man . 
  he said , that at the time when he was young , roma people were traveling between cities , selling their handmade stuff , make entertainment for people , etc. 
  when locals were bored they were traveling to new places . 
  now they have money from government and have no need for traveling and earning money . 
  for roma people their traditional lifestyle changed not so long time ago . 
  he was accusing the social welfare system for todays situation . 
  in z\u0142oty . 
  in this criterion it should be correct : ` cuban detention camp in guantanamo ' or ' 9/11 american terrorist attack ' . 
  we gave you the gurke and we receive a gewalt instead . 
   but unlike our eastern friends , we do more with our potatoes than just boil them in water . 
   edit : butthurt slavics , as always . 
  more like opposition to the xenophobic , biased opinion resulting from lack of knowledge and ignorance . 
  an old joke about potatoes and policemen : policeman comes to the store with french fries and says : - french fries please the seller response : - excuse me , but we ran out of potatoes . 
  police officer : - no harm - i will eat it with bread .

  one of the best things that we have thanks to christopher columbus . 
  thank you christopher for potatoes !, 
  my one of the best teachers at the university was ukrainian one . 
  he was teaching the signal processing . 
  he was involved into the ussr space program . 
  he was the one of the best people i met . 
  let 's not forget about lands , we had a common history - ukraine , belarus and lithuania - we share blood , culture , kitchen and many more . 
  but hungary - yes , it works . 
  and ~ ~ russians ~ ~ ussr-men . 
  it would be nice to hear a belarusian journalist visiting eu countries . 
  thank you for sources . 
  i checked it and it was ~ ~ true ~ ~ confirmed in polish sources . 
  there was such an single accident . 
  and it is really shameful . 
  this man was also apologized by president of the city and local archbishop . 
  the aggressors was reached by police and over 100 poles demonstrated the support for him and against this aggression . 
   iirc polish far-right idiots nearly killed a christian syrian refugee in poland . 
  i did not hear about that . 
  have you got any sources ? 
  it does not exclude . 
  a door holding for a women and passing them ahead is a sign of good manners  even it is allowed to kiss a woman 's hand , although some feminists [ fight that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plcnnthfxju ) . 
  sure . 
  bayern is the folks . 
  i believe they will choose their own future . 
  for their own good . 
  accurately . 
  the only difference is such that some groups shout louder and have international support . 
   poland , hungary and the czech and bayern . 
   and how many crimes go unreported or the corrupt police in poland and the rest of eastern europe does n't bother to investigate ? 
  imho it is quite biased opinion . 
  or maybe you mean crimes shadowed in ` different ' criterions in some wise , democratic , leading , modern , non-biased and full of preaching countries ? 
   he spoke polish and did not speak a word of ruthenian is it an important criterion ? 
  if so -- did he speak lithuanian ? 
   i merely clarified what it was in reality .
