  thank you for clarification - i really appreciate it . 
  but i 'm not sure why you changed units from monthly to weekly . 
  even if - i do not know where you got 10-20 euro weekly . 
  the data that i have given are the size of 143-216 euro per month . 
  how did you made your calculations ? 
  on the other hand the monthly average net wages in for example poland in 2014 amounted to 674 euro - to be more precise , the median was 494 euro and dominant was 359 euro - [ data ] ( http://wyborcza.biz/biznes/1,100896,17860612,ile_naprawde_zarabia_polak__zaskakujace_dane_gus.html ) . 
  imho - if you compare dominant values of wages in one of eu countries to the amount of free money giving away for refugees and migrants by german government - do not you think that it is devaluation of the efforts of working people in eu and the real magnet that attract people from all over the world ? 
   nobody is given a house for free . 
  i did not mean a house as a building , but as a free accomodation in houses or flats . 
   as for so-called pocket money , it 's pretty much what i said it was . 
  from the second link , example of germany :  143 euros per month in cash for `` basic needs '' , rising after three months to maximum of 216 euros . 
  is n't it free money ? 
  from googling : according to this document : [ naturalisation policies in europe : exploring patterns of inclusion and exclusion ] ( http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/7-naturalisation%20policies%20in%20europe.pdf#page=65 ) , citizenship may be granted to refugees after few years ( from 2 in case of belgium ) . 
  pocket money and other social benefits by eu countries : http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/16/which-european-countries-offer-the-most-social-benefits-to-migrants/ example of helping refugees to integrate by helping them to find a housing solution , notably in the private housing market : https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/intpract/reloref-looking-for-housing-for-refugees-1, 
   tusk says that the eu can make itself less attractive to refugees do n't you think that it is the best solution ? 
  why giving free houses , free money , citizenships etc. 
  war refugees imho do not need that . 
  just get rid of the magnet that attracts economic migrants . 
   yeah , sure , you can tell by looking whether someone is a pole or a russian ... 
  it 's the matter of proportion of the skull . 
  op just know how to recognise it . 
  it is interesting . 
  could you give some examples ? 
  how can you distingiush pole from czech or serbian by e-mails in english ? 
   for personal income-related reasons not surprised . 
  it is your choice . 
  what would you like to do ? 
  and by the way - what sanctions ? 
  you push france not to sell their mistrals for example - but which other countries you push to put sanctions against russia ? 
  at the same time you and your former prime minister were making pipe to europe , that would put germany as monopolist to sell the russian gas . 
  do not mentioning to push weak southern countries to give up their own south pipe . 
  all of that was done in the name of solidarity . 
  applause . 
   what is the polish equivalent of putinbots ? 
  do we call them pissers ? 
  the polish equivalent of putinbot is ' [ gerhard schr\u00f6der ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der ) ' - the former chancellor of germany working for russians now for really big money . 
  we call them shortly gerhard . 
  do you like reading ? 
  i really like orwell for example and truly recommend his books - for example ' 1984 ' . 
  it was quite popular in poland during communist times in ` not formal ' market . 
  but - at meritum - have you seen democratic * voting about sanctions against russia ? 
  edit : - added ' * democratic ' to be more smart . 
   eu members are not independent . 
   and every country conducts diplomatic efforts , that 's what the `` pushing '' means . 
  it seems that all contries are equal , but some countries are more equal than others . 
   yup i think pis is dangerous for your democracy . 
  but i will not express my feelings - becouse it could be rude - but if you ask - this dissonance could be dangerous for germany and your democracy . 
   i read so far in the international news ... me too . 
  and it is quite scary . 
   alone the difference between true pole and bad pole should be a trigger warning . 
  just like trigger differenting people using key-words like ` democratic ' and ` fascist ' . 
  and all of this is done by only 30-days while the new government is governing in poland . 
  what will be next ? 
  how many people must die ? 
  but seriously - bbc ? 
  this sketch is getting silly . 
   you anti-german i have a german blood in my veins . 
  criticising german government makes me self-hating german ? 
   be a bunch of paranoid fascists . 
  have you any proofs for your claims ? 
   and would n't it be better the government ( regardless which ) would have less influence on the media ? 
  it would be the best imho . 
  using key-words like ` anti-something ' , ` paranoid fascists ' , etc can make somebody excite about him/herself and placed automatically in a box with the word ` smart ' on it - but believe me - it is not true and this key-words are devaluated . 
  me too . 
  any other solution ? 
   oh look , it 's poland again . 
  yeah - it is boring . 
  what can we do ? 
  just promise to choose pro-german politics next time and hire all of the former media propagandists ? 
  most of our countries in europe comes from the same root . 
  we have shared words like ` son ' , ` men ' , numerals etc which are present in all indo-european languages . 
  we also have common concerns - in our fairy tales the motif ` bad wolf ' is commonly present . 
  in poland , we use to talk about people who have gone mad , or started to respond in a compulsive way , just like pavlov 's dogs attracted by external messages - that they gone [ rabies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rabies ) - is it the same in your country ? 
  do you use the same term to describe such of people ? 
  it matters on which level of the ladder you are , and if someone do not cheat with you . 
  hope it will not be popular news in poland . 
  farmers here are quite nervous and will start to protest blocking the traffic using their tractors . 
   i can imagine the reaction in poland if we did n't force sanctions on half of europe . 
   `` ze germans are conspiring with moscow to invade poland again ! '', 
  did you just say , that germany is pushing independent countries to do what they do not want to do ? 
   i think this is just a prelude to their `` style '' . 
  you have a russian minority . 
  you are imho the next potential place where russian would like to protect their interests aka ` sphere of influence ' . 
  is it really what you would like to say ? 
  hope you are not another ` useful guy ' taking your opportunity to piss on bullied at the moment poland . 
  is it your `` style '' ? 
  what ` what ' ? 
  considering amount of poles in the world , that would be another empire the sun never sets . 
  on the other hand we can activate our people in voting system in gb and do it anyway . 
   of all the places in the world i 'd least expect to find isis supporters i 'd say lithuania would be in my top 10 . 
  no one expects the isis warriors . 
  it is not working for me . 
  do they have any data about other countreis ? 
  maybe you should change the ceos of public media ? 
   because they 're different problems . 
  really ? 
  if you would like to narrow the issues only to laws cases , then both supreme court and political dependence of the media was the issue then too . 
  i think that answer is more simple . 
  we are human beeings and we are sensitive to propaganda . 
  look at the amount of articles , blog entries , bottom-up activities etc after last democratic elections .
