  i know something from my own experience . 
  do you ? 
   eh , why do i bother exactly . 
  on which site you will be at this time ? 
  anyway hope that you will give us a refugee status again . 
  well - it was supposed to be a joke . 
  i know they sleep sometimes too . 
  on the other hand look at the news on the first page of the / r/europe for the last month - and say if there is no obsession about poland and it 's new government ? 
  it 's a rhetorical question . 
  and please , please do not use ad hominem eristic arguments . 
  have a great next year . 
  unfortunately you can be right about money , but for sure he will decrease his ability to be influential in polish politic . 
  do you know that he was considered as an candidate to the polish presidency ? 
   following viktor orban 's steps . 
  orban is the hungarian pm and  during his time some anti-democratic steps were taken like  controlling state media , some ` people of culture ' associated with the organization http://obywatelekultury.pl/ accused in an open letter of appropriation and politicization of public television . 
   nationalizing pension funds , [ done ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/poland-pensions-idusl6n0h02uv20130904 ) by previous government . 
   appointing a political governor of the national bank of hungary etc. 
  according to secretely recorded tapes , the governor of the polish national bank was plotting with government about dimision of the minister of finance and how to use bank to send some money to the budget to not let pis win . 
  source in polish : http://www.wprost.pl/ar/452396/handel-glowa-rostowskiego/ all of the steps was done by previous government conducted by tusk . 
  have you heard any complains in international newspapers about it ? 
   the pis seems to really enjoy this type of doing politics and follow in his footsteps . 
  pis do not have to take the steps that was done by previous government . 
  loose reference to [ international workingmen 's association ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_workingmen%27s_association ) . 
  you should have noted that i was writing about rhetoric that was used by the author of this article . 
  please see the quotation in my previous post . 
  it is interesting , that there was no resound on the same thing that was done by former government . 
  not even in slightest level . 
  the biggest recipient in the absolute terms . 
  on the other hand west get a quite big market for their product after taking most of our factories . 
  not mentioning the brain drain and some other issues . 
  hope it was mutual benefit for all countries . 
  please do not use key-words such as ` democracy ' , ` illiberal ' etc. 
  please give facts and try do judge them . 
  do you remember such a reaction when former government party was doing exactly the same ? 
  were journalists connected with today 's government running abroad and writing tones of hysterical articles ? 
  journalists connected with gazeta wyborcza never rest and are working 24/7/365 . 
  some kind of international journalist association ? 
  communist bosses would not agree with you . 
  you are right - we have better quaility of democracy now . 
  we and all other countreis should appraciate it and respect of democratic choices made by the poles . 
  you are right . 
  ` do siego roku ' is an archaic form . 
  anyway i sent a message with ` szcz\u0119\u015bliwego nowego roku ' to my firends . 
  you can be . 
  hope we will stay the one from central europe . 
  for me it is more like communist bosses concerned about ` undemocratic ' changes in countries such as poland and czechoslovakia . 
   europe must not let that happen . 
  poland is too big and important an eu member to be allowed stray into the `` illiberal '' democracy camp . 
   the nation which produced the solidarity movement does not deserve such a future . 
  the people of poland should not be abandoned in these trying times . 
  that is really scaring . 
  i have a feeling that i heard it before . 
   sounds like business as usual for state media . 
  exactly . 
  but this time it is very hard to cut off these people from influence and money . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3p8_qo1tu0 ) is one of the prominent journalist of public tv - tomasz lis - calling a crowd for ` democratization ' after loosing his job . 
  just another pavlov reflex action from a user . 
  please do not use google translate - your message is not too comprehend . 
  just use english . 
   any other insightful comments in this thread like this one ? 
   devout grannies no - this thread is for young , educated leftists ones from big rich cities living in their own enclaves . 
  no country for old men . 
  or woman . 
  especially devoted . 
  yea - grannies are stupid . 
  we are modern and smart . 
  cos we are young . 
  you mean skeletons in the cupboard ? 
  there is no institution in lithuania that would dare to work with this issue by now . 
  hope you do not need any institution to watch , observe and draw a conclusions . 
  you can use google or few days of history at this thread by the way . 
  thank you for the post from poland that is not lead by apologist of former government claiming that we are nazi . 
   they are taking a page straight out of the nazi seizure of power book . 
  the same was done by previous government and i did not hear any claims . 
  fyi here is the [ nazi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazism ) term explained . 
  could you explain what action of new government can be described as nazi in your opinion ? 
  so - if you are so sure - give an example and proof your claim that the nazi in poland is rising . 
  do not believe in everything that is written in your newspapers by polish propagandists of former government . 
  [ chru\u015bciki aka faworki ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=faworki&amp;tbm=isch ) - my grandma used to do it . 
  i miss her . 
  i 'm going to build a windmill . 
  will germany pay me for the abandoning the plan ? 
  but seriously - is n't it an absurd ? 
   when the comparisons made by the argument are actually appropriate . 
  so you really think that the new government is nazi ? 
  joke ? 
   all glory to mighty fascist poland !, 
  [ godwin 's rule of nazi analogies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law ), 
   if you elect nazis they are going to do nazi things . 
  [ godwin 's rule of nazi analogies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law ), 
  we are checking people at external borders of the eu . 
  but we are backward , weird , racists , xenofobic and undemocratic , especially from last 30 days . 
  in portugal too ? 
  happy holiday season ? 
  is ` happy christmas ' offensive to nordics ? 
  ok . for what ? 
  it is not my field of interest . 
  i heard that there are some people from poland full of curses in their mouth . 
  but it is not a good statistical representation of polish society for sure . 
  what about stop playing and instead visiting poland ?
