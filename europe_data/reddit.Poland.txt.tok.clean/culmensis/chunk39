  what will they do next ? 
  they will find a solution ? 
  hope this time it will not be the ` final ' . 
  c'mon - do n't be so shy - in criterion of catholic believers ( is it something bad and you are ashamed of ? ), 
  or percentage of the suicide lit ( h ) uania is the leader . 
  it 's not a matter of fractions . 
  it 's the matter of feelings . 
  i accept and appreciate even 1/1024 if they feel poles . 
  it seems that pendulum of national emotions in germany begins to recede . 
  hope they will reach reasonable resting point . 
  recently on russian websites were published articles claiming that polish president urges poles to take some part of ukrainian soil . 
  here 's the official statement posted on the website of the [ president duda ] ( http://www.prezydent.pl/kancelaria/dzialalnosc-kancelarii/art,11,komunikat-kancelarii-prezydenta-rp.html ) : `` on october 22nd several turkish news websites posted an article , quoting president andrzej duda 's alleged remarks on polish-ukrainian relations . 
  the story was based on a text published previously by a russian-language site affiliated with pro-russian separatists in the donbass region . 
  we hereby declare that all remarks which appeared on the above-mentioned websites and were attributed to the polish president , are fabricated and have nothing to do with reality . '', 
  imho pro-russian donbas separatists want to divide poles and ukrainians . 
  it seems that restitution issue has the same source . 
  in poland , this issue does not exist on major websites . 
  i had to look for information about restitution and found that an newly created association `` restytucja kres\u00f3w '' was founded and declared help to all interested people . 
  this organization was founded by vice president of the pro-russian party `` zmiana '' [ konrad r\u0119kas ] ( http://partia-zmiana.pl/team/rekas-konrad/ ) . 
  this party has no support in the polish society . 
  it seems that this was done to divide ukrainians and poles . 
  this initiative has no support in poland . 
  what about samogitians and samogitia ? 
  he is controversial but for sure he is not nazi sympathizers . 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/9jlplfsgv1u ) is his speach . 
  he is accusing german government for pressing to unification . 
  could be . 
  anyway - do you agree with my statement , or not ? 
  what language was used in gdl at that time ? 
  another way : let 's close another polish factory . 
  let 's build the nordstream version 2 . 
  obligations ? 
  - have some money . 
  and remember - big part of it should be back . 
  in grand duchy of lithuania the official language was [ ruthenian language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruthenian_language ) - language of former belarus and ukraine . 
  i have impression that many poles here also do the same about poland . 
  i like it , 
  ( god save the tsar !, 
  ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yds72nucrg ) russian empire anthem . 
   what do you imagine ? 
  him sitting in his warshaw volcano lair , going : ` now you 've done it , polish people !, 
  you have signed your own doom !, 
  please do not exaggerate . 
  it would be enough if he just would not use words like ` stupid ' and do not trying to threat poles . 
  not a party , but our current president duda 's wife 's father is [ julian kornhauser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julian_kornhauser ) - polish-jewish writer , translator and literary critic . 
  president duda was also a guest - as a mp - in [ knesset session ] ( https://youtu.be/fuj43-cj1eo ) ( [ article from ynetnews ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4434206,00.html ) ) in poland . 
  so i think he is quite supportive for the jews . 
  it is all the past . 
  but even today - i was once surprised when we were in our local polish pub with a girl with hungarian roots , that for many years is living in the uk . 
  she speaks perfect english and pretends to be english one . 
  but when we were in that pub it was a some kind of caraoke competitions . 
  and we choose and pushed her to sing the ` omega gy\u00f6ngyhaj\u00fa l\u00e1ny ' song with original text . 
  and she sung that . 
  and then poles were coming to our table to drink with us . 
  i 'm not sure why - but it works for us . 
  bless you . 
  some of us know . 
  we also know that your prime minister during iiww p\u00e1l teleki refused germans demands to attack poland from your teritory - the reason he put was the morality . 
  and he ordered to mine the train-ways in case germans wanted to use it . 
  during iiww you took over 100.000 citizens of poland and even started polish schools in your country for us . 
  during the warsaw uprasing you were ordered not to fight along with poles , becose it was a big probability that you will do that . 
  even hungarians that took part on the german site gave the weapons , food and armor to the poles . 
  [ here ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plik:warsaw_uprising_hungarians.jpg ) is the grave of hungarian soldiers fighting along with us during warsaw uprasing . 
  we have also common history that took ours jewish minority to be a 5-th column during communist time . 
  and helped ussr communists to start their goverments in our countries . 
  we share the same history from houndreds of years . 
  you are appreciated in poland . 
  hope they will try to calm down at least and try to find a rational and legal solution . 
  it will take some time imho . 
  the time is working for the rest of eu . 
  let 's wait . 
  i remember that time . 
  it was discussed at that time and i was trying to find serbian online websites to send them message that it was our government and it was not our decision and we are sorry . 
  and i send that message to them at that time . 
  i do not know any poll at that time . 
  i remember that it was quarrel between tusk government ( pro ) and kaczynski president ( against ) at that time . 
  i was sure that it is happening today . 
  the whole discusion was laying at bad layer - sorry . 
  conclusions - we are bombarded by many sources and footages . 
  imho it is our/your ( depending on the geographical/national place ) role to give a actual context that could be understood by other readers . 
   this happened more than a decade ago . 
  this footage was published 16.10.2015 on youtube . 
  i was convinced that it is a new material . 
  was it 10 years old ? 
  should have noticed / s at the end of my statement . 
  every destroying of mankind heritage is bad and you should not use ` and you are lynching negroes ' rhetoric to defend actions performed by this mob . 
  it was bad , but is bad now also . 
  without excuses . 
   they 'll repair when everything settles . 
  that 's how conflicts work . 
  if they are going to rebuild all of they destroyed and are destroying now by themselves - then it is no problem / s. 
  and because of that we should be glad with that barbarians ? 
   90 + % of population on kosovo are albanians ... 
  it 's far too late to deny them a country . 
  i 'm not pretending to be an expert in balkan history , rights and demands , but i hope that it is not the excuse to destroy serbian heritage . 
  hope they are not barbarian talibans or other kind of wild islamists to destroy mankind heritage . 
  i 'm not talking about albanians - you have your country , right ? 
  i 'm talking about kosovo - the controversial part of land that belonged to different nations , and the nations are trying to justify their claims . 
  i 'm not judging who is right . 
  but in 1998 there was a break of status quo of this region .
