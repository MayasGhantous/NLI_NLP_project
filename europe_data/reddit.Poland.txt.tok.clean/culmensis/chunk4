  i 'm affraid that it is unilateral feelings . 
  i did not find any reliable source and i do not know it it is a rumor but churchill said : `` the poles are like the irish , only more so . '', 
  here are some added values to the masterpis . 
  in the future , this image could be much more famous and expensive - like [ this one ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/71/58/bc/z12343409q,obraz-before-and-after - restoration - . jpg ) . 
  recursion . 
   the proof of slavs being an inferior race according to the nazis was that they had let themselves be infiltrated by the jews , i.e. 
  it is interesting . 
  have you any sources of this ? 
  my sequence : 1 . 
  trying to read . 
  google translate . 
  writing . 
  google translate . 
  publication . 
  c , c++ , c # and some java . 
  mostly writing and reading , but i can speak it aloud too . 
  seasonal food ? 
  fruits : apples , prunes , pears etc. 
  mushrooms from forest : [ boletus ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/boletus ) , [ badius ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boletus_badius ) , [ parasol mushroom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macrolepiota_procera ) 3 . 
  [ sour cucumbers ] ( https://31.media.tumblr.com/d0b97878869eeff8f47d2b2e7abb04be/tumblr_inline_n04vsmwie11r30xh1.jpg ) - it is not the same as pikled ones . 
  if you want distingiush it you can use different words for exemple : ` starozakonny ' ( old-order ? 
  ( rule ) ) means ' \u017cyd ' ( religion ) , and we can describe it for example : ` person of jewish origin ' , ` irreligious jew ' etc. 
  of course . 
  here is a big sentiment to lithuanians and former rzeczypospolita . 
  we made a lot of good things together . 
  from the other hand i 'm always suprised when i 'm reading delphi.lt ... 
  get rid of andrej babis from government  or do not let him defame our products . 
  at least in such a rude manner . 
  which part ? 
  so the war . 
  then i will throw away all my lego . 
  in polish ' \u017byd ' ( capital letter ) means nationality and ' \u017cyd ' means the religion . 
  according to jewish religious law you are a jew when your mather or grandmather is/was jew . 
  so you are \u017byd when you are \u017cyd , but not neccecerly \u017cyd ( e.g. 
  atheist ) when you are \u017byd . 
  this may be related to the ottoman empire . 
  the ottoman empire in the polish history books is always described as the invader , which we had to defend . 
   we did n't immediately sacrifice every british person alive imho it 's overreacted opinion . 
  actually at the beginning of the war you did not sacrifice even one person . 
  poles !, 
  we need to quickly find the replacement for this thread . 
  let 's find as soon as possible similar maps for other countries !, 
  at the beginning of 90 ' it was a big influx of gypsy beggars from romania to our towns . 
  they were the only romanian citizens that we knew . 
  this fact only strengthened the stereotype that romania is a home country for gypsies . 
  until now , in colloquial speech , rumun ( citizen of romania ) means a gypsy . 
  so you should treat that poll more like the an answer for question what do we feel for ` gypsy beggars ' and not romanian . 
  i remember when i was in 90 ' at the meeting for young people in prague and there i met a lad from romania . 
  the first impression was - * jesus , he is white !, 
  he must be one of the kidnapped children that my grandma was talking about ( she warned me when i was child : do not go far and alone - the gypsies can kidnap you ! ) . 
  his parents had to survive a big tragedy . 
  do he knows that he is kidnaped ? 
  * thank god i do not shared my thoughts aloud with him . 
  what is in your opinion the belarusians view of russia - eu ( or russia - ukraine ) , if i may ask ? 
  how many belarusians share your point of view ? 
  what is the gender of switzerland ? 
  yeah , i know - but as far as i know , you have the ability to vote via internet using your id card . 
  just curious if he can use it from white house , or is any ` blacklist ' used to turn off some voters . 
  can he vote now ? 
  russians have to eat something . 
  you are right . 
  here is many apoligiest of totalitarian ideologies . 
  these ones that never lived under one of such . 
  it seems that they are taking their wisdom from the computer screen , books , and maybe a couple of protests on the streets . 
  not from real life . 
  any totalitarian ideologies such as nazist , fascist , communist should be strictly forbidden . 
  i do no know where are you from but your statement make me sure that you never lived under the totalitarian regime . 
  for you it is probably just another fancy utopia . 
  for us it is just suffering and death . 
  from the other point of view - which implementation of communist ideology do you fit most : 1 . 
  soviet ( 20 mln victims ) 2 . 
  chinese ( 65 ) 3 . 
  north korea ( 2 ) 5 . 
  east ( cetral ) europe ( 1 ) 6 vietnam ( 1 ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_black_book_of_communism and yes - it was communist and nazi regimes that fight with religion , priest and churches . 
  here you have the list of catholic victims in poland : 1 . 
  it 's very tasty . 
  but if you concider what was the source of it ... 
  imho us concept to shift a cheap work , without know-how , to china did not work . 
  unfortunately . 
  you can see that at op map . 
  imho we should expect big shift in global market soon . 
  unfortunately . 
  it 's time to start learning chinese language . 
  i doubt - his earlier messages about poland was rude . 
  unless he is self-hating pole . 
  here you have a link , which say that he is an american : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2er95i/poland_and_germany_disagreements_over_the_eus/ck28xvb, 
  we have obolon beer in poland . 
  never heard ` elektrolux ' one . 
  yet one example : ` rower ' ( from rover ) for a bicycle . 
  [ kaszanka ] ( http://www.unimies.com.pl/gallery/wyrobygarmazeryjne/kaszanka-vac.jpg ) - a sausage made of a mixture of pig 's blood , pig offal ( commonly liver , lungs , skin , and fat ) , and buckwheat . 
  [ czernina ] ( http://pu.i.wp.pl/bloog/42359484/47451459/118147_czernina_002_n_big.jpg ) - a soup made of duck blood , clear poultry broth , vinegar and sugar . 
  [ flaki ] ( http://niebowgebie.blox.pl/resource/flakipowarszawsku.jpg ) - a soup made of tripe ( is a type of edible offal from the stomachs of various farm animals ), 
  history is far far from deductive , unambiguously science . 
  i do not know why , but germany certainly dominate the eu . 
  take a look at the latest developments concerning ukraine . 
  previously in talks between russia and the eu have been involved many countries . 
  today , despite the fact that the eu has a foreign minister , the future of eu and ukraine is decided by merkel . 
  alone . 
  i hope that you are a good prophet . 
  if you are real us citizen , and not a russian troll , and you are still pissed off because of us military ally financing - you may find interesting this data : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_foreign_military_financing#by_country maybe you could canalize your anger for other countries .
