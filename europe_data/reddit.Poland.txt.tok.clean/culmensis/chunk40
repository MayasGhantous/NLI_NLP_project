  and this was dangerous for the rest of europe . 
  if you are trying to compare this situation with poland : after wwii great powers arranged new map of influences and parts of it belonged to particular countries . 
  unfortunately we were no part of this decisions . 
  according to their decisions we lost some part on east and we got some part on west . 
  not mentioning that this part of land belonged to poland in the history . 
  despite of that we are trying to save the part of previous history . 
  not destroying it - like you . 
  destroying is not a good solution . 
  please compare : this is wroc\u0142aw ( breslau ) in [ 1945 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsp_f52h9fy ) and [ now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jijkojmqw10 ) . 
  we are rebuilding history of that place . 
  not destroying it . 
   the germans were against your independence . 
  so were the russians . 
  so because of that we should recognize every nation that pretends to be a country ? 
  in 2008 the polish government recognized the independence of kosovo . 
  the then president was against this decision , like most of society . 
  imho it was a mistake . 
  once again , sorry . 
  there are two classes of r1 : first-class a and second-class b. 
  there were differences in treating jews by german in occupied france , denmark and poland . 
  in german-occupied poland jews were forced to live in closed ghettos and there was introduced a law of punishment of death for helping the jews . 
   maybe it has to do with the fact that he was born there as a jew and knows the country . 
  are you suggesting that he hates poland because he is a jew ? 
  i can assure you that not every jew hates poland . 
  the number of jews killed by poles are estimated . 
  the number varies depending on author . 
  for example krzysztof persak estimated that 10 % jews escaped from ghettos ( for reinhard action area it was 1.6 million of jews - thus 160.000 , according to him , escaped ) and 30 - 40 thousand survived . 
  conclusion ? 
  the rest - 120.000 was killed - mostly by poles . 
  despite of strange assumptions of 10 % the conclusions are imho delusional and wrong . 
  in 1264 , the duke of greater poland boleslaus the pious issued the general charter of jewish liberties known as the statute of kalisz . 
  the statute granted jews unprecedented legal rights in europe , including exclusive jurisdiction over jewish matters to jewish courts , and established a separate tribunal for other criminal matters involving christians and jews . 
  the statute was ratified by subsequent polish kings : casimir iii of poland in 1334 , casimir iv of poland in 1453 , and sigismund i of poland in 1539 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_kalisz, 
  depends on century . 
  from [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jews ) :  many expulsions during the middle ages and enlightenment in europe , including : 1290 , 16,000 jews were expelled from england , see the ( statute of jewry ) ; in 1396 , 100,000 from france ; in 1421 thousands were expelled from austria . 
  many of these jews settled in eastern europe , especially poland . 
   menachem begin fyi - he was born as mieczys\u0142aw biegun . 
  meaning : mieczy -  sword ; s\u0142aw -  glory ; biegun - a pole ( in the ` north ' or ` south ' pole meaning ) . 
  =  sword ` sglory pole, 
   france was butt-licking your asshole . 
   your minority is too blind and `` dumb ''  promising absolute lies . 
   why are you so nationalistic  i hate people like you imho such a language does n't help . 
   `` ca n't let him defile and contaminate our people by dating our daughter/sister/etc . '', 
  how is it in the case of turkish girls dating non-turkish boys in us ? 
  i forgive you , son . 
  it is just an example of bias associated with age and simple geriatriofobia . 
   20 year-old guy being a xenophobe or a racist , but if you 're 40 and have nothing better to do with your time than brawl with foreigners no offence - just curious about your imagination concerning the ` behaving ' of particular age - how old are you ? 
  thank you for your explanations . 
  for the first time , when my submission is deleted/shadowed i had an explanation about reasons of censorship from moderators . 
  i really appreciate it . 
  on the other hand - i found it interesting . 
  much more than other submissions in this subreddit . 
  respect for the local and international law , this is what is the spirit of europe imho . 
  without imaginary guilt and willingness to help everyone . 
  today , hungary is the mainstay of the rule of law and common sense . 
  we should help them before . 
  i am very pleased that we can help them now . 
  in the name of international solidarity and solidarity between our - polish and hungarian - nations . 
   for the same reason they were against increasing the rigths of [ ... ] frontex could you give any source ? 
  that over-representation is really shameful . 
  where are our european values ? 
  we have to use quota in this subject . 
  asap . 
  [ god save the tsar !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yds72nucrg ), 
  i can see it only in youtube comments . 
  all people i know are ok with ukrainians . 
  but of course some of the movements of ukrainian government are not ok from my point of view . 
  ukraine ? 
  this is the one i found recently . 
  i was just curious what anthems were sung in my former school and found this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yds72nucrg this was the national anthem of the former russian empire . 
  by the way - do anybody know what was the russian empire anthem before that one ? 
  exactly . 
  polish names for these food : blood sausage -  kaszanka juka -  czernina cold borscht -  ch\u0142odnik fermented cabbage -  og\u00f3rek kiszony pig fat -  boczek in poland is also popular [ tatar ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/nj94tikozve/maxresdefault.jpg ) made with raw beef , raw egg yolk , chopped onions and cornichons . 
  is it popular in other parts of former cw ? 
  that is not true . 
  consider for example kuro\u0144 - one of the face of the former anti-communist opposition - he was trockist 's communist . 
  or michnik - another pillar of anti communist opposition - they were/are just a far-left socialists . 
  from wiki : [ october 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/october_1 ),

   poland and it 's support comes from opposition to russia . 
  we are not so opportunistic . 
  we share common history and imho we like you . 
  you can see many footages on youtube made by ukrainians about their life in poland and most of them are positive . 
   hungary even if it was really splitted like during wwii , we had great support from hungarians at that time . 
   same things happened 150 years ago . 
  imho at that time , ` refugees ' just trusted in usa slogan :  `` give me your tired , your poor ,  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ,  the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
   send these , the homeless , tempest-tost to me ,  i lift my lamp beside the golden door ! '', 
  the ` refugees ' were not promised to reach free goods from government , free houses , promise of integration and preserve of local religions , believes etc. 
  all they can take at that time was to promise to treat equally at work market . 
  and it was fair imho . 
   guess they have been lied to and manipulated into thinking they will be offered the world . 
  imho , they have not been lied or manipulated . 
  i remember a times when poland was under soviet occupation . 
  at that times goods from the ` west ' were measured in dollars . 
  basic , local goods could be purchased in local currency . 
  the average monthly salary measured at the black market value of usd was at $ 15 per month . 
  i think these people behave similarly . 
  their goal is to get here , to survive and get to hand the money they can send to their families . 
  and that amount of money , that for you is just pocket-money - for them is a fortune .
