   the law and justice ( pis ) party , which has governed poland for the past year , does not scare easily . 
  but the tens of thousands of black-clad women who filled city centres across the country on october 3rd seem to have shaken it . 
  it was not the pis proposal . 
  it was a proposal from an ngo . 
  imho the whole article draw a biased and not fair picture of bad pis . 
   he only said that most mps of pis will support the bill . 
  sources ? 
  probably it 's about influence from [ henry iii of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_iii_of_france ) - elected king of rzeczpospolita and after escaping - king of france . 
  from article in wiki - about fork and toilets :  in many aspects , polish culture had a positive influence on france . 
  at wawel , the french were introduced to new technologies of septic facilities , in which litter ( excrement ) was taken outside the castle walls . 
  [ 19 ] on returning to france , henry wanted to order the construction of such facilities at the louvre and other palaces . 
  [ 19 ] other inventions introduced to the french by the polish included a bath with regulated hot and cold water , as well as forks . 
  henri iii ( 1551 -- 1589 ) [ ... ] he is widely credited for having introduced the fork into france . 
  imho , the poo part was more important  fortunately our minister did not mention it . 
  he could say , that we learned the french poo into toilet instead of palace 's salons .

   last time he retreated after 6 days or something . 
  it was not pis proposal . 
  in the same interview kaczy\u0144ski said that he would not vote for it . 
  i have impression , that every single racist attack in poland is widely published and commented in international media . 
  when it 's about other countries ( excluding uk after brexit ) it 's labled as ` local news ' and not published . 
  romania stronk !, 
  in this city the joint soviet-nazi parade occured in 1939 . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ifmbqs8fdc ) is the footage . 
  from [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_military_parade_in_brest-litovsk ) :  german -- soviet military parade in brest-litovsk ( german : deutsch-sowjetische siegesparade in brest-litowsk , russian : \u0421\u043e\u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0420\u041a\u041a\u0410 \u0432 \u0411\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 ) refers to an official ceremony held by the troops of nazi germany and the soviet union on september 22 , 1939 during the invasion of poland in the city of brest-litovsk ( polish : brze\u015b\u0107 nad bugiem or brze\u015b\u0107 litewski , then in the second polish republic , now brest in belarus ) . 
  it marked the withdrawal of german troops to the previously agreed demarcation line and the handover of the city and its fortress to the soviet red army . 
  is n't it a local news ? 
  i agree . 
  there is no democratic ways to appeal . 
  just so-so . 
  i 'm sure you have something else ... 
  not bad  next ? 
  i 'm pole and probably because of that i do n't get it . 
  care to explain ? 
  funny as always  something next ? 
   come to poland !, 
  your car is already here !, 
  so we have the first one . 
  next ? 
  you are right . 
  so - in case to not forget it - let 's spread it : please put the first one here :, 
   call your mom to clean my bathroom ? 
  it was not my mom , but sister of my grandma . 
  she was taken to germany as a slave worker in 1942 . 
  her ubermensch owner was quite fine according to her , and he did n't beat her too much . 
   stop stealing our cars ... 
  i hope that this stereotype is over . 
  well - it 's hard . 
  now you can light the bedside lamp with a lampshade with intriguing tattoos . 
  i agree . 
  a little bit imho  on your picture it 's the [ wattle and daub ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wattle_and_daub ) type of wall . 
  it 's very popular in poland - you can see it here for example : https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/szachulec, 
   fat on a friday ? 
  meat on a thursday ?

  i like georgian songs - thank you for sharing . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-9cozcicu ) is the georgian song dedicated to tragically died polish president . 
  thank you georgians . 
  this food looks so much nordic . 
  and maybe even scandinavian . 
  hope it would be enough alcohol for both of them to make an important conclusions . 
  [ marianna doli\u0144ska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marianna_doli%c5%84ska ) was a romani woman from antoni\u00f3wka , radom county , poland . 
  on the night of 11 december 1923 , she murdered her four children and hung them on a tree . 
  a photograph of the bodies of the children was falsely used to represent victims of the massacres of poles in volhynia and eastern galicia , committed by the ukrainian insurgent army . 
  like i said - it is not smart move imho . 
  imho this film should be created earlier . 
  now , when ukraine is in war , crimea is taken by russia , we should not make movies like that . 
  it could be used by russian propaganda to picture ukrainian in bad light and to stir our two nations . 
  like in the ` divida et impera ' slogan . 
  my friends from the school bench from primary and secondary school immigrated to germany . 
  one of them was the best phd absolvent , conqueror of awards in our local university . 
  both of their families have children in germany , raised in all the german system of schooling and growing up . 
  their children consider themselfs as germans . 
  lastly i was calling to one of them and their children give up talking polish with me and ask father to the phone . 
  they were german , they can be pround of their roots , but they are not polish anymore . 
  good for you germans , i think . 
   if kaczy\u0144ski says that he and most of the pis supports you bloody know that they will vote as he pleases unless he changes his mind . 
  imho it 's just a biased opinion . 
  please let 's talk about facts and not about forecasting of the future . 
  there is no plan of pis , or more specifically - our government - to support this project . 
  on the other hand there is a lot of biased hate towards pis and kaczy\u0144ski particularly , pumping by some of the media . 
  last time this sentiment led to political murder of pis member , commited by former member of opposition .
