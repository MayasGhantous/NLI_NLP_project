  so please let 's talk about facts and calm down . 
  support from particular members of ruling party is not the same as being the author of this project , right ? 
  decision about supporting it or not is individual case of each pm . 
  there is no party 's whip on this voting . 
  using statements like ` polish government 's plans to criminalize abortion ' is just - in the best case - manipulation , imho . 
   express a disapproval for polish government 's plans to criminalize abortion in any circumstances it 's misleading description . 
  this is not the pis ( our government ) plan . 
  the protested proposal was made by some of ngos without significant public support . 
  so please calm down . 
   i dont think like one . 
  what is the difference in way of thinking between lithuanians and slavs according to you ? 
  just curious . 
   they just robbed russia . 
  agree . 
  pity , that you let them go . 
   most of russian oligarchs could hardly buy food after fall of ussr , let alone a country . 
  ca n't agree . 
  see [ mikhail khodorkovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_khodorkovsky ) , [ arkady rotengberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arkady_rotenberg ) , [ roman abramovich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_abramovich ) , [ boris beriezovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_berezovsky_\\ ( businessman \\ ) ) , etc. 
  i would like to ` hardly buy food ' like them . 
  some of oligarchs in russia bought entire country - russia , after fall of ussr . 
  did they care about average russian citizens at that time ? 
  tell me the hidden part side of history -- master . 
  hidden for these who do n't know the details . 
   war was already lost by 17th september some might draw similar conclusions in case of [ 1920 war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) , when the soviet troops were near warsaw . 
  it was a joke - have a good night . 
  you are joking  that is good , because i thought that i have to trying to rescue you from commiting suicide , 
   oa\u015e escape as quick as possible !, 
  before uk will shout all thier borders , and will kill of all of us !, 
  but seriously - is that as that bad ? 
   i 'm magyar and i want to be part of it . 
  romanian or hungarian part ? 
  you seems to be right - because i do n't recognise your flair , and i 'm not sure about all that stuff concerning differences in transilvania , moldavia etc. 
  god bless you romania - take a care about your former lands . 
  if they want to be your part . 
   lol more butthurt polish nationalists who want the eu 's money but do not want to abide by her treaties lol - looking at your flair - tell me more about it  but seriously - are you a real greek or just a troll to quarrel us ? 
   the previous government started it . 
  but they have n't been in power for almost a year now . 
  the previous government made it when they had a mayority in our parliament . 
  it was in previous year . 
  nobody from todays defenders of ` democracy ' ripped clothes or shed a tear at that time . 
  is n't it a hipocrysy for you ? 
  where there was the defenders of ` democracy ' from eu fraction institutions ? 
  eu fraction rulling today eu and that former polish government belonged for ? 
   the solution to breaking the constitution is not breaking it even more . 
  today 's mess is imho just a consequence of previous government movements . 
  hope somebody will dare to judge them . 
  i hope that all the mess will be finished in december , when all the set of ` indepened ' judges + 2 another ` independed ' judges will finish thieir work . 
  and their colegues from eu fraction currently rulling eu will not help them again . 
  for me it was a precedence of breaking constitution that former government conduct and it 's consequences . 
   this tribunal was created by communist general who with it started the martial law period in 1981 and the main judge was the vip member of young comunists . 
  you are right - it was created by communists - to authenticate the rule of thier governments . 
  it was a political body . 
  until last few years their work was not visible for regular folks . 
  it was not such a big mess like today . 
  the mess started when former government realised that they will loose next elections and choosed next 2 redundant people to their set . 
  to have a majority in tk for the time of the government 's successors . 
  to have a real impact to the former government . 
  now we have mess left by the former government . 
  hope it will be cleaned in december - when the previous set will be finished . 
   i ca n't off the top of my head think of an equivalent ... found in google : [ he 'd lay down in traffic for you , he 'd walk a mile in the rain to help you out  ( http://naszaszkapa.pl/vademecum/tlumaczenia.html ) think about difficulty of translating some of the uk idioms and pharses like for example ` limp biscuit ' for other languages . 
   so now they are trying `` negative '' ones imho they are using actual issues . 
  by the way - they are ? 
  i 'm not watching tv . 
  how to use it ? 
  maybe we poles should make a new buzzword such as ` antipolonism ' to play that card - or oposite - put focus that the poles in uk are only the biggest group from ee that covers slovaks , czechs , lithuanians - etc. 
  what is better according to you ? 
   i see that `` positive '' government actions ( come back , we want you here ! ), 
  to convince people to come back failed miserably so now they are trying `` negative '' ones ( come back , they do n't want you there ! ) . 
  people will fight for their rights and dignity over there and poland is not a safe haven at all . 
  try better . 
  are you suggesting that all of that uk issues were provoked by this hated pis government and kaczy\u0144ski ? 
  masz racj\u0119 - zobaczy\u0142em ten tw\u00f3j wpis :  well that motherfucker indeed looks polish :d proof me wrong ... look at him ... might be from any ee country thats true . 
   but who gives a fuck here at that moment - i do . 
   i 'm just trolling here to be honest ... you can troll about polish . 
  you will not dare do it for some of the nations . 
  - bet ? 
  write someting about it . 
   that motherfucker looks polish ... i you mean that motherfucker looks polish or that motherfucker looks czech or that motherfucker looks slovak or that motherfucker looks whitebrushed arab ? 
  which criterion have you use ? 
  can you see all buthurd when somene use your racist , xenophobic statement : for example :  that motherfucker looks jew ... hope you are ashamed ... 
  seems to be real [ cities of hate ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrhwps_bbc-panorama-stadiums-of-hate-euro-2012_sport ) . 
  will bbc make a similar footage about this ( this time seems to be real ) problem ? 
  exactly . 
  for me - before elections every broadcaster and media in poland were biased against pis . 
  now only the public media do the same propaganda for pis . 
  the rest - tvn , gw etc. 
  is still making propaganda against pis as usual . 
  imho it 's not about previous/current politicans struggle - but it 's about our inferiority complex - supplemented by media such as for example gazeta wyborcza . 
  it 's easier to say bad things being first , before anybody do that . 
  this is a defense mechanism . 
  then people feel smarter and better . 
  hope it will change in the future . 
   also you stole our crown  o jesus , it 's somenting new in all the rain of sorrow . 
   he 's talking about people who claim that grand duchy of lithuania was n't created by lithuanians or even ruled by lithuanians . 
  have you got in today 's lithuania any songs , writings , poems , thoughts about our common history ? 
  not in the rivalry criterion , but in common-wealth criterion . 
  former lithuanians such as today 's belarusians or ukrainians have . 
  for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttb2qzvwwi4 , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47kuw7xksj0 , are you proud about our common history ? 
  belarusians seems to be , but you ? 
  my parents are watching your muhte\u015fem y\u00fczy\u0131l series .
