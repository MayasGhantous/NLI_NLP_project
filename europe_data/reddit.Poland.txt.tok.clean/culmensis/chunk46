  for them the communist time was better because they were equally good as the rest of the people . 
  equally good but at the low level of poverty . 
  because everybody was poor . 
  the divide of the classes are of course bad , but the advantages of it is that poor people can see that life can be better for them , they have the goal that can be reached by them . 
  imho it 's a good magnet for getting rich the population and not the stearing from the goverment level . 
  do n't tell me . 
  not only in turkey . 
  my mother loves it . 
  she is looking the new episodes with polish captions in computer , but last time - she was watching 1 episode without it ( in turkish  ) - because she would like to know what happend  . 
  hope we are at the rising trend and we have better future for our countries . 
  romanians acceleration of gdp looks great . 
  in the survey woman were asked ` how often has someone : [ ... ] burned you [ ... ] ' . 
  wtf ? 
   leave poland and come to sweden . 
  you know you want to lol if you will trying to leave sweden and trying to get to poland - please remember that you will need positive certificate from the local christian priest in your parish . 
   i get along with poles quite well in sweden . 
  why do n't you join your brethren ? 
  i 'm not sure if i understand you correctly . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  r u sure , u r not butthurted by posting messages about being butthurted , bro ? 
  let 's not start counting our chickens . 
  in polish this idiom is ` not to share the skin on a bear ' ( nie dzielmy sk\u00f3ry na nied\u017awiedziu ) . 
  hope it 's right translation . 
  it 's easy - you can read it from the context - people that were comunists . 
  why do you delete your comments ? 
  how do you think ? 
  we have them here too . 
  they were settled in the center of cities during communist time . 
  that is the reason that houses in our cities are ( was ) not ` renovated ' . 
  this kind of people is called ` soviet people ' - they ca n't do anything by their own - they need ` them ' , ` government ' that should take care of them . 
  paint for them , pay rents etc - because they have for example children and they have their own needs that must be payied without any work . 
  hope it 's marginal , only for extreme situations - like for orphans in poland . 
   public housing thanks for response . 
  but what is that ? 
   quite the opposite !, 
  not sure why - maybe my english lacks . 
  but for me - he is judged also as a teacher . 
  he is judged by exams score . 
  the score is like this : take the number of pupils that passed exams divided by overall number of pupils that were approved to the exam . 
  if he will discourage some number of ` poor ' pupils and left only ` good ' before exams - he will get better score at the end . 
   you can not afford most of the shiny stuff the west has to offer by living of welfare . 
  it 's not about ` shiny stuff ' but about differences in acceptance of this amount of money in different countries . 
  i remember times , when $ 15 was an average salary in poland ( counting the ` black market ' prices of us dollars ) . 
  i know that it 's working for today too . 
  the pocket money given by german gov to ` refugees ' can be nothing for germans , can be noticable for ee countries , can be average payment for ukrainians and for poorest can make their whole family or willage living for that amount of money . 
  and it 's the real magnet that attract all the people from all of the world . 
  the free and easy money . 
  and please do n't be afraid - where is your 's heritage ? 
   explained to them that they 'd be better off and would be earning decent money . 
  probably he cared about statistics of exams , overal-look of the school , and amount of money he can get from gov. 
  welcome to the real world . 
  some people must make an unpoppular decisions in their audults life . 
  who is paying their bills , for what and where they are living - tl ; tr - how can they afford such a life ? 
   i think migration is for the same reason world wide , a brighter future and a larger slice of the pie . 
  and not all of that ` refugee ' stuff ? 
   maybe you should go and ask your fellow poles who left poland in droves since 1991 . 
  please provide your own flag near your nick or tell me where are you from - than i can provide the same rhetoric at your level . 
   eastern europe is n't multicultural is because it does n't have a strong colonial past . 
  like sweden - but see what happend for them . 
   now someone ( `` the left ? '' ), 
  have you the same issue in hungary ? 
  are they the same people - ` moral authorites ' that owns newspapers and tv ? 
  hint - descendants of the soviet revolution ? 
   eastern europe 's local governors are trying to spin the facts to pretend they 've been smart enough to `` resist '' multiculturalism , while the reality is much more simple : eastern europe is n't multicultural because no one wants to go there . 
  you are right . 
  we had some ` christian ' ` refugees ' from syria that we invited to poland but then they escaped to germany . 
  it was awful imho . 
  what are the reasons that all of the people want to go to germany , sweden and uk and trying to escape from poland , france , etc ? 
  is it only the german-merkel invitations , amount of free , pocket money they can get , spread out of money for non-working people with many children , policy that gives ability to reunion of their families , lack of checking documents at borders ? 
  what is the reason according to you ? 
   it was a joint enterprise . 
  let 's not forgot about role of [ judenrats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judenrat ) , [ jewish getto police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_ghetto_police ) and jewish [ kapos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapo_\\ ( concentration_camp \\ ) ) . 
   there were jewish guards in camps and ghettos as well . 
  afaik there was only german and [ jewish getto police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_ghetto_police ) in gettos . 
  he is talking about [ polish blue police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_police ) :  in october 1939 , general governor hans frank ordered the mobilization of the pre-war polish police into the service of the germans . 
  the policemen were to report for duty or face the death penalty . 
   similar police organizations existed in all german occupied countries based on professional local police force . 
  among others they were forced to guide people to the death camps , assits in [ roundups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roundup_\\ ( history \\ ) ) , etc. 
  despite of the victims nationality . 
  poles too . 
   another nation could completely paralyze the entire country by bribing a polish noble to veto everything . 
  for sure [ bribing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_czech_political_corruption_scandal ) and [ ` liberum veto ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament ) was a reason . 
  but let 's do n't forget about [ ukrainians uprasings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising ) and swedish [ deluge in which , the commonwealth lost approximately one third of its population as well as its status as a great power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_\\ ( history \\ ) ) . 
   sweden , several :  everybody is asocial and quiet  sweden is a socialist paradise  sweden is becoming a caliphate  everybody is blonde , hurrdurr  not a stereotype , but ikea  `` rape capital of the world '' ( people should stfu about issues they do n't understand ) which one is n't truth ? 
   charles de gaulle [ this one ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/dt860r/charles-de-gaulle-statue-in-warsaw-dt860r.jpg ) ? 
  we remember and appreciate him . 
  vive la france . 
  according to polish social network the footage about pilsudski role was broadcasted in lithuanian tv last thursday . 
  with the same thesis . 
  [ a picture is worth a thousand words ] ( http://imgur.com/a/efejh ) . 
  imho you are talking about romanians = = gypsy . 
  that stereotype is really unfair for you . 
  it 's changing lately i hope . 
  on the other hand - at issues like [ that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4xjr2e/armed_man_injures_seven_on_swiss_train_bbc_news/ ) we can see that people are aware of that bloody pc stuff . 
  however it seems that this attitude works for western countries only . 
  hope it will work for you too . 
  this battle is listed in [ the fifteen decisive battles of the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_fifteen_decisive_battles_of_the_world#derivative_works ) article in wiki . 
   the migrants . 
  maybe it 's not so stupid . 
  instead giving them free money , they could receive it for real work .
