  [ god , bless the hungarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himnusz ) . 
  imho they could be loyal soldiers at peace time , but i doubt they would like to die for germany . 
  i like this song very much . 
  imho better version : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yds72nucrg, 
   `` spoiler : they all die '' more correctly : ` they all will be killed '' . 
  and it was probably about this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/execution_of_the_romanov_family, 
  imho because it 's from a polish blog article made for polish viewers . 
  and their goal was not to publish it for international viewers , but to emphasize poland . 
  poland is a disarmed country . 
  here is a [ map showing the number of weapons per 100 people ] ( http://realpolitik.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/posiadanie-broni-w-eu-1024x842.jpg ) in eu . 
  for me they are the ` big boys ' playing in survival , running with a dummy weapons in the woods , and pretending to be soldiers . 
  but overall , i think it is good . 
  you seem to be biased about pis . 
  pis exists for a long time and i never heard about force solution promoted by them - even when they were in opposition . 
  on the other hand i heard many proposal of this solution comes from today ` democratic ' opposition . 
  this ` big deal ' exists only in the space created by the ` liberal ' media , which always wanted paint patriotic attitudes in bad light . 
  someone should take the empty space created by declining todays petrol-driven cars , 
  for me : [ the master and margarita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_master_and_margarita ) , [ the pillars of the earth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_pillars_of_the_earth ) , [ aquarium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aquarium_\\ ( suvorov \\ ) ) . 
  all the words exists in czech too , i suppose -- with almost the same pronunciation . 
   you have to be doing something , even if you are just moving boards from one pile to another or tossing stones back and forth . 
  is n't it 's just like a regular work at it department in a big corporation ? 
  at the level of near-neighbourhood relations - we and they - want it . 
  w\u0142adys\u0142aw gomu\u0142ka - the communist prime minister in poland once said : ` although we stood on the precipice , but we made a big step forward ! ', 
  hope you reached the wall . 
  [ black lives matter - message from the swedish feminist party ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9tzvxxjxpq ) . 
  hope government has a good reason to do that , and this is not a will to piss off russia ( borders with ukraine were opened again ) . 
  open open border is good for both sides and we should live in good relations with our neighbours . 
  for poland ( as far as i understand ukrainian and english used in military ) : medical equipment and supplies , individual equipment uniforms , packed lunch . 
  quite high considering deflation . 
  how much are interest-bearing cash deposits in romanian banks today ? 
   i have cited historians christopher r. browning , yehuda bauer , leo cooper and arno j mayer , all of whom who attest and this citations does n't prove your claims . 
   unfortunately that claim does not hold up to scrutiny . 
  examples ? 
  how many cooperated ? 
  what percentage of population ? 
  cant they just buy it directly from aliexpress ? 
   which i wo n't engage in anymore . 
  i just asked about sources . 
  you were trying , but you were not able to provide any reliable source that would prove your claims . 
  i 'm not denying that this fragment could appear in report . 
  but please provide context - becouse this could change the meaning of it . 
  it was probably warning about moods in polish society and not plans for ak . 
   `` officially '' barred jews from joining and planned on attacking returning jews again - any reliable sources ? 
   what are you talking about ? 
  polish [ wiki article ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ejszyszki ) says ( google translate ) :  in 2005 , an american professor of jewish origin yaffa eliach gave the newspaper the new york times interview in which he claimed that on 19 october 1944 about 11:00 pm in ejszyszki there was a `` pogrom '' , the result of which had killed two persons of jewish origin ( cipora sonenson and her son chaim ) , and she was supposed to be an eyewitness to these events . 
  in the action , according to yaffa eliach , had to take part of 150-strong force of polish , including about 80 uniformed army soldiers , and the action was to be aimed directly at the civilian jewish population . 
  /  i know there was no armia krajowa in 1946 , it was your answer for this question :  the ak carried out massacres of jews ? 
  got any source for that ? 
  it was wrong example of ` ak carried out massacres of jews ' imho . 
  poles were not cooperating with nazi officials . 
  poles were threatened by the death penalty for helping jews . 
  despite of that many helped and many died for that . 
  for sure there was some percent of poles , that behaved badly , but it 's hard to generalise this on the whole population . 
  you are accusing us for ` refusal to accept our dark history ' , but did not answer my question : ` do you know any members of judenrats , getto police or kapos that were accused and judged by courts for their deeds during holocaust ? ' . 
  in [ przytyk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/przytyk_pogrom ) , according to gontarczyk , jews attacked poles first , then poles attacked back . 
   `` jews would approach wagons , and [ polish ] women there had to cover themselves from rocks and baton hits , meted out by jews '' . 
  furthermore , as chodakiewicz writes , jews shot in the backs of the retreating poles , wounding at least three people . 
  [ 5 ] a polish peasant stanis\u0142aw kubiak was shot in the back by luzer kirszencwajg , while stanis\u0142aw popiel was shot in the arm . 
  i 'm afraid that in some countries , people will commit crime to get to this . 
   i guess someone skipped hungary from author 's comment :  three hungarian squares also missed the cut , p\u00e9cs would have been around # 45 but the photos i have of it are n't very impressive , taken in dark winter weather . 
  sopron ended up at # 51 , just outside the list . 
  k\u0151szeg , `` hungary 's jewellery box '' i 'm sure also deserves a place based on photos i 've seen , but i 've never been there before . 
   '' if the masses of jews ever return , our population will not recognize their restitution claims , but will treat them instead as invaders , resisting them by violent means . '', 
  i never heard of that . 
  it could be a worning about mood in poland , but not goal . 
  have you any more information about that ? 
  [ stanis\u0142aw aronson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis%c5%82aw_aronson ) is the first example found by google . 
   polish jew and an israeli citizen , as well as a former officer of the polish home army ( ak ) with a rank of lieutenant . 
  he was also a member of the elite kedyw unit , `` kolegium a '' , of the warsaw region of ak , a participant in the warsaw uprising of 1944 , and a lieutenant colonel of the israeli defense force who took part in the israeli war of independence , the yom kippur war and the 1982 lebanon war . 
  are you sure that this yehuda bauer is a reliable source ? 
   one which comes to mind is the paw\u0142okoma massacre . 
  according to [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paw%c5%82okoma_massacre ) in paw\u0142okoma lived 1370 residents including 1190 ukrainians , 170 poles and 10 jews . 
  how many from that 10 jews were killed ? 
   polish armed forces also committed a pogrom in the town of eishyshok [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ei%c5%a1i%c5%a1k%c4%97s ) article says that it was not done by poles . 
  yaffa eliach describes action of home army of kidnaping soviet soldier . 
  during this action 2 jews were killed . 
  but they were not the goal . 
   finally , while not the ak perse , there was also the kielce pogrom in 1946 where polish communists massacred up to 46 jews . 
  there were no home army in 1946 . 
   a refusal to accept its own dark history . 
  do you know any members of judenrats , getto police or kapos that were accused and judged by courts for their deeds during holocaust ? 
  pay attention , that if you would remove all the ` anti-semitism ' stuff from your message - you have said literally nothing . 
  please find another arguments that are valuable . 
  / u/depressed333 deleted his message again . 
  it was like : what the fuck are you implying ? 
  and here is my response :  what the fuck are you implying ? 
  implying ? 
  calm down man . 
  the war was here . 
  in our soil - not yours in us or israel . 
  every family in poland i know has a victim killed by germans or communists . 
  imho , you as a jew have no monopoly for suffering during wwii . 
  we have our victims too . 
  for example - brother of my grand-grand-father was killed ( hung in mass action ) by germans during inteligent action . 
  his nephew was accused and prosecused by communist jews and send to gulags in ural mountain . 
  he returned after few years , but noone recognize him . 
  he was so thin and sick . 
  never told what happend there - just cried . 
  he died after few years . 
  he was my grandpa .
