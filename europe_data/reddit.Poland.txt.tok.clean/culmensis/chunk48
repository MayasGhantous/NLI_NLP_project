  any examples of of massacres made by armia krajowa ? 
   and all the other persecuted groups , including ordinary native civilians . 
  it 's hard to break the monopoly for suffering from the current narrative . 
   satanism is the same as christianity , just playing for the other team ^ ^ ^ / joke it seems that you can be next pope . 
  for sure you will not be more controversial than francis . 
  edit : just get rid of this xenophobe us-and-them division . 
  all religions are equal and good . 
  interesting . 
  ther are available any thoughts of the pope on other religions such as for example satanism ? 
  that 's exactly like me  they achieve opposite goal it seems , 
  please do n't take it personaly . 
  i meant something like this : http://www.jhi.pl/ and ` historian ' like gross . 
  and i remember times when there was discussion about gross publication in poland . 
  this discussion was lead by gazeta wyborcza . 
  every single voice that not support their pov was described as anti-semitism . 
  there were few examples of polish historians like nowak or chodakiewicz that dared to express different opinions . 
  but the rest - choosed silence . 
  it was disapointing . 
  unfortunately this way of thinking reminds me the narrative of some ` polish ' journalists and historians . 
  and does n't seem to be an exception . 
  wish you best , neighbours . 
  hope war will end soon . 
   your thesis is just completely farce i do not want to use the same rethoric , but you seem to be living in alternative world without taking into account facts . 
   majority of polish jews were haredim and were poor and you can not change the facts . 
  and please do not remove your previous messages , even if you are ashamed of them . 
  thanks for source . 
  i checked the links and found that this sentence comes from ` social and political history of the jews in poland , 1919-1939 ' by joseph marcus . 
  please pay attention , that it was average in statistical meaning . 
  the jewish community in poland was divided for poor and wealthy persons . 
  from the same book : ' 0.1 percent of jewish income recipients or about 1000 families received about 5.5 percent of the jewish population total income ' . 
  please read on the page 47 . 
  ` nearly 95 % of jewish [ ... ] belonged to the lowest income group , many of them being virtually paupers . ', 
  thanks for sources , that confirms my thesis . 
   bullshit , jews made up most of your business and progress and were more educated than the average polish , is that what you call ` not integrating well ' ? 
  any sources ? 
  according to [ polls ] ( http://biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/content/9371/zwalczanie_gruzlicy.pdf?b55592 ) there were 45 % of illiterates in jewish community in lublin in 1921 . 
  sanitary condition of the districts inhabited by jews left much to be desired and was constantly concern the administrative authorities . 
  problems above tightened particularly in during wwi . 
  the state of hygiene and health and living conditions of jewish society has become a concern of wealthy jews and jewish intelligentsia . 
  do not forget , that many of jews immigrating to usa from poland were illiterates too ( they drew circles instead of crosses to sign documents ) . 
  majority of polish jews were haredim and were poor ( compare it to nowdays israel ) . 
  you can google ` shtetl ' ( jewish town ) and see the wealth on pictures , 
   with the compliance and often help of their polish neighbors . 
  there was no place for poles in this . 
  list of jews sent to camps were prepared by jewish [ judenrats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judenrat ) then were taken by [ jewish getto police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_ghetto_police ) after arriving to camps they were taken by jewish [ kapo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapo_\\ ( concentration_camp \\ ) ) . 
   jews should not be considered as poles they were polish citizens . 
  some of them considered themselves as polish and were loyal citizens . 
  but imho they were unfortunately minority . 
  you took our job ? 
  i have an impression that you are supersensitive towards poland . 
  is that something personal ? 
   we never see a swede or a french person boasting . 
  for me it 's just people that are proud of their country and want to share it in this sub . 
  i will not call it boasting . 
  and here you have some posts from last few days concerning advantages of sweden : [ sweden officially the ` goodest ' country in the world , study says ( woohoo !, 
  ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4unrq8/sweden_officially_the_goodest_country_in_the ) [ the european innovation scoreboard 2016 ( sweden , denmark , finland , germany , and the netherlands are innovation leaders ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4sv2qn/the_european_innovation_scoreboard_2016_sweden/ ) [ tallest building in sweden ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4rroh9/tallest_building_in_sweden_190m/ ) [ sweden overtakes ireland as ` goodest ' country in the world ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4mhyav/sweden_overtakes_ireland_as_goodest_country_in/ ) and by the way - i have opposite oppinion . 
  imho poland takes a lot of bad mood since we choosen pis government here on / r/europe . 
   i do n't think ethnic poles themselves during the time counted jews as poles , you can ask opposite question : did ethnic jews considered themselves as poles ? 
  in an article entitled , `` jews and poles lived together for 800 years but were not integrated , '' published in forverts ( new york , september 17 , 1944 ) , yiddish author and nobel laureate isaac bashevis singer wrote :  rarely did a jew think it was necessary to learn polish ; rarely was a jew interested in polish history or polish politics . 
  ... even in the last few years it was still a rare occurrence that a jew would speak polish well . 
  ** out of three million jews living in poland , two-and-a-half million were not able to write a simple letter in polish and they spoke [ polish ] very poorly ** . 
  there are hundreds of thousands of jews in poland to whom polish was as unfamiliar as turkish . 
  the undersigned was connected with poland for generations , but his father did not know more than two words in polish . 
  and it never even occurred to him that there was something amiss in that . 
  i agree that it could be a tautology , but it seems that words are loosing their meaning lately . 
  i just wanted to be precise . 
   and is it really hate if you like it this way ? 
  of course it is - choosing the time of publication , arguments . 
  i 'm old enough to remember articles from ` kraj rad ' or ` trybuna ludu ' for me - it was the same level of propaganda . 
  edit : and - what is imho important - this article was imho probably written by the same kind of people that wrote hymnes for stalin or lenin - from the same set of communist collaborator ` poles ' . 
  i 'm not complaining . 
  i 'm not involved in any part of this created , fake division of polish society . 
  i just spot that yet another catholic-heiter author get his/her possibilities in ` international ' media to express their biased hate . 
  and i 'm just sad about it . 
  i agree that pope francis is seem to be more modern than che guevara . 
   i do n't see any butthurt , could you elaborate ? 
  thank you for your question . 
  choosing the time of this negative publication - it 's on the same time when wyd is happening . 
  choosing ` local news ' and statements of local and not important persons to help draw an impression of backward of catholicism :  asked by polish television on monday night about security at the event , a government official said there was a `` pact with holy father john paul ii '' to protect it . 
  who said that ? 
  any context ? 
   the church 's political ally , the nationalist law and justice party ( pis ) , has been running the country since november . 
  former prime minister ( tusk ) and president ( komorowski ) were also involved in official catholic movement such as official masses etc. 
  do you consider them as not-catholic-allly - like author of this atrticle would like to describe ? 
   whereas francis has suggested that perhaps gay people are not all wicked , pis 's leaders insist that sexual deviation of all kinds is a threat to the nation . 
  sources please - both from francis and ` leaders ' . 
  it 's 20 % of this ` article ' - should i analyse more or it 's enough for you ? 
   never saw that in english internet , probably because of we were under occupation of left-wing communist from 45 to 90 . 
  and we are aware of leftist , communist biased propaganda and their buzzwords . 
  it looks like another attempt to analyze the catholics made by a cosmopolitan international ` liberal ' and biased anti-catholics author . 
  it seems that they have a big buthurt , caused that the world youth day was a success in poland and try to find any - even ridiculous arguments - to present them in a bad light . 
  the author is probably from polish ` gazeta wyborcza ' that belongs to the people sharing ` liberal ' point of views when it concern ` western ' world , but not when it concerns israel . 
  we officialy recognise 6 polish nobel winners : maria sk\u0142odowska-curie ( phisics and chemist ) ; henryk sienkiewicz ( literature ) ; w\u0142adys\u0142aw reymont ( literature ) ; czes\u0142aw mi\u0142osz ( literature ) ; lech wa\u0142\u0119sa ( peace ) ; wis\u0142awa szymborska ( writer ) ; this list is from our government site : http://www.ryga.msz.gov.pl/pl/wspolpraca_dwustronna/kultura/polscy_laureaci_nobla/, 
  it 's pity that this post has 0 points . 
  have my upvote !, 
   may be just `` judges '' ? 
  sorry - but it would lose the sense . 
  please read it again . 
  i 'm not from pis and i did not vote for them . 
  your view of the world seems to be narrowed by pis and po struggles .
