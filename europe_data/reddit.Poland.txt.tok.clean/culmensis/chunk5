  who knows ? 
  she may even become the schr\u00f6der ' successor in the nord stream . 
  it depends . 
  it was brave . 
  damn yugoslavia - why did you split ? 
  there is francis now and not john paul ii . 
  because it is the only friend of putin . 
  here is the etymology of some of these duties : marsza\u0142ek - a head of sejm or sejmik - from german ` march ' ( horse ) and ` schalk ' ( servant ) . 
  starosta - a head of powiat - from ` stary ' ( old ) w\u00f3jt - a head of gmina - from german vogt taken from here : http://gazetaregionu.pl/kultura/303-wojewoda-marszalek-starosta-burmistrz-skad-sie-wzieli.html, 
  i do not like the idea . 
  looks like trolling and simple advertising . 
  if you want work as taxi driver in poland you have to be a registered self-employed , pay monthly insurances , taxes , have the fiscal cash register and taximeter . 
  some days ago uber started their business in poland . 
  as far as i understand their goal is to connect drivers and people that would like to reach a point . 
  these drivers could be an ordinary owners of cars without all of above restrictions . 
  imho it is not fair competition for ` legal ' taxi drivers . 
  and all the consequences of possible tax law violation is pushed on the drivers side . 
  thanks for clarification . 
  i have learned some russian at school . 
  i can understand it less or more . 
  i sometimes have occasion to hear ukrainians ( mostly politicians on tv ( maybe they were talking russian  ) and i can understand big part of it . 
  for me your language sounds similarly to russian ( floating accents and some kind of ` singing ' ) . 
  i always thought that russian and ukrainian language are very similar - like slovak and czech . 
  what do you - redditors from ukraine - think about this idea of decentralization ? 
  it was brave . 
  you can not extend this far-reaching conclusions for whole nations based on a single event . 
  you could just as well say that only one man in czechoslovakia protested against ( [ jan palach ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_palach ) ) . 
  and in bulgaria , russia , hungary and east germany no one did protest . 
   the opinions were pretty divided . 
  i really doubt it . 
  i remember communist times and i did not know any person that would support communists even if someone was a member of communist party . 
  it was opposite - please consider the [ pozna\u0144 1956 protests ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pozna%c5%84_1956_protests ) , [ 1970 protests ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_1970_protests ) and big support for all that solidarno\u015b\u0107 movement . 
  in his context it may be a tragedy . 
  interesting . 
  considering the name of this criterion - could you please write what was , in your opinion , the main innovation worth of mentioning for all of these listed top 20 countries in 2014 ? 
  imho poles have become accustomed to periodic russian sanctions . 
  this happens quite often for few last years . 
  sure - for belarussians and russian olighars - thus it can arise many new fortunes . 
  but not for everage russian citizen . 
  it would be the best if russia gave back crimea to ukraine and all sanctions would be revoked . 
  but imho in the current situation smuggling via bielarus is the best solution . 
  edit : grammar . 
  it 's a win-win situation . 
  thanks to putin , belarus can become the biggest producer of shrimps , apples , pork and salmon in the world .

  poland , on the verge of total defeat , suddenly rebounded and defeated the invading red army , then pushed it back . 
  it was , and still is , celebrated as a great victory for the polish people over russia .

  borscht is very popular in poland too . 
  we have different versions of it : * classical ( clear one made on the basis of chicken broth with red beets ) serverd with [ uszkami ] ( http://www.polonianet.be/site/files/teaserbeelden/poolse2keuken.jpg ) * [ ukrainian ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/0/3539/z3539420m.jpg ) - with beens , cream , red beets etc. 
  we have also a plant called [ borscht sosnowskiego ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heracleum_sosnowskyi ) that come to our soil due to a decision to use it as a silage plant during the ussr rule .

  from [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_kazakhstan ) : captured participants of the 1830-1831 november uprising and the 1863-1865 january uprising , as well as members of clandestine organisations , were sent into exile throughout the russian empire . 
  at least 250,000 poles from the polish autonomous regions of the ukrainian ssr were deported to the kazakh ssr in 1930 ; among those , as many as 100,000 did not survive the first winter in the country . 
  [ 6 ] after the soviet invasion of poland , another 150,000 poles were deported from eastern polish territories to kazakhstan ; 80 per cent of these were women and children , as the adult men of their community were typically absent due to army service .

  let me correct you - ` ja pierdole ' would be the best one . 
  from the other hand - russia had her own history and people influenced world like for example tchaikowsky - well known gay person . 
  do n't you think that if tchaikowsky would live at this time - he would end at the trash place with a bottle in his ass beaten by his fellow russians ? 
  as well as 1612 dymitr samozwaniec - yet another gay in your history ?

  putin !, 
  taken from here : http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2cz0uz/what_users_from_russia_see_when_trying_to/, 
  in poland catholic church played big role in anti-communist movement . 
  churches were the place where you could have a substitute of freedom during that sad time . 
  it was place where people from opposition could speak to the people . 
  priests at that time were persecuted by political police ( example : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerzy_popie%c5%82uszko ) . 
  it was clear division : us - the polish people together with catholic church and them - communists and russians . 
  nowdays i never heard that church in poland is trying to achieve political benefits to the vatican state . 
  from the other hand it is hard to compare israel and vatican in criterion of loyality . 
  being a jew is not only the believe but also a nationality . 
  israel is a home country for every jew - you can have a citizenship of israel if you are jew or your mather or your grandmather is a jew ( regardless of whether a believer or not ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://gingerparrot.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/red-hair-map-europe.jpg ) you are . 
  and we all go blind from that . 
   this is how banks work . 
  not everywhere . 
  in poland interest rates varies [ from 2 % to even 5 % ] ( http://ranking-lokat.kontomierz.pl/ranking-lokat ) . 
  prognosis for 2014 inflation is 1.6 % . 
  it works for z\u0142oty but for euro the rate is much lower . 
  the interest rates are lower than the inflation . 
  value of money is dropping down in the function of time , even if you are keeping it in a bank . 
  thank you - it seems that you are loosing on it too . 
  because i have it and the alternative is to keep it in a sock . 
  so what are the interest rates for euro in nederlands ? 
  using this ` geographical ' path you can call the guantanamo as ` cuban detention camp ' . 
  or 9/11 as ` usa 11 attacks ' . 
  please do not take this poll so reliable . 
  romanians in poland are considered as roma people .
