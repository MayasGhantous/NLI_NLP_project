  - it seemed to be well with us they feel they indeed said so , and here a great surprise when we found an empty apartment even without a farewell letter . 
  although it 's been a few days , i see that many parishioners can not recover from this situation , that we opened our hearts , and they disappeared . 
  you can see the sadness in the parish - he adds . 
   they should n't be poles anymore , they are born in and live in lithuania . 
  i 'm not sure if you are trolling . 
   or the poles should maybe start integrating after decades of living here . 
  you know how all of this ' - ization ' is hard to conduct . 
  we tried with you for hundreds of years and you can see the results . 
  poles living in lithuania did not migrate there . 
  they are living there for generations . 
  it was the answer to [ glinciszki massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glinciszki_massacre ) made by lithuanians . 
  some historians claim that it was an independent decision of the local commander , not a command superiors ak . 
  but yes - killing innocent people is awfull . 
  and killing 30 people is not the same as killing dozens of thousands . 
  but can you provide any link from reliable source ( not describing it ) that claimes your thesis :  it did as much shit as ukrainians , if not more . 
   there 's culture differences in many more occasions than you 'd think . 
  could you give some examples ? 
  just curious . 
   well , dzier\u017cy\u0144ski was 100 % a polish noble ... oh please do n't give him yet another ammo for his personal war . 
   just wait ; soon pis history textbooks will be praising them as heroes while vilifying bartoszewski or edelman . 
  this is not a gw forum , please try to keep the level . 
  imho this article is biased . 
  if you know russian or ukrainian language you can find many movies about life in poland made by them in youtube . 
  imho they are just fine . 
  the ukrainian buthurts is about the resolution of the polish parliament concerning volhynia masacre . 
  keep going that way  and i was talking about current migrants and not people living there for generations . 
   i love the irony of how eastern europeans keep insisting on free movement so that millions of them can move to western europe but their own countries are actually extremely xenophobic . 
  we have few hundred of thousends of ukrainians in poland . 
  and they are fine . 
   so it 's even not his memories . 
  just third-party stories . 
  cool so it 's a lie ? 
   as any freedom fighters or army . 
  there were casualties among civil population . 
  so all armies are genociders now ? 
  they were goal not a casualties of fight between soldiers . 
   he is talking about 1942 . 
  it 's over one-hour video - where exactly he is talking about 1942 ? 
  it would be easier if you have any written realiable source . 
  there is no rajmund rajs ( bury ) street in poland on the other hand . 
  and they are not worshiped in history manuals . 
  one / u/ruzhanovskiy is active here like 100 poles , 
   how many do you remember pre-3 years old ? 
  he is talking about his parents and family memories . 
   nope upa did not kill children , woman and villagers ? 
   you can start from this . 
  he is talking about 1944 and you claimed , that  that massacres of their people [ ukrainians ] began earlier , in 1942 , when poles wiped out thousands of ukrainian villagers in the predominantly polish areas of kholm have you got any reliable source about your claim ? 
    there are tons of written memories  bullshit [ here ] ( http://natemat.pl/138643,miroslaw-hermaszewski-ocalalem-z-rzezi-wolynskiej-nie-ruszac ) you have momories of miros\u0142aw hermaszewski - the first polish cosmonaut . 
  he survived the massacre . 
    volhynia massacre  you mean volhynia liberation from polish nazi collaborators and occupants . 
  by killing children , woman and neighbours - only becouse they were poles . 
    have you got anything about your statement ? 
   sure than write it here . 
  there are tons of written memories of volhynia massacre . 
  have you got anything about your statement ? 
  for me , underrated factor in the collapse of the rzeczypospolita was the swedish [ deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_\\ ( history \\ ) ) . 
  the invasion by the swedish army and its allies ( brandenburg-prussia and transilvania ) , resulted in the loss of 25 % of the population in four core polish provinces . 
  lesser poland lost 23 % of population , mazovia 40 % in villages and 70 % in towns , greater poland 50 % in villages and 60 % in towns . 
  royal prussia lost some 60 % of its population . 
   there was a need for reforms . 
  [ constitution_of_may_3 , _ 1791 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_may_3,_1791 ) . 
   as far as i remember there is some religious stigma and taboo in jewish religion concerning removing dead body from the ground . 
  hope we are secular country . 
   ukrainians claim that massacres of their people began earlier , in 1942 , when poles wiped out thousands of ukrainian villagers in the predominantly polish areas of kholm any sources ? 
  the jedwabne issue is controversial imho . 
  discussion in poland started after publication by gross . 
  he claimed that it was 1600 jews burned in a barn - which was physically impossible . 
  there were more controversial statements in his book . 
  then ipn ( polish historian institute ) started their investigation . 
  during the archeological works some of the bullets ( locals have no arms ) and big statue of lenin was found in the barn . 
  after that , the exhumation works was forced to stop on demand of chief rabbies of poland . 
  the ipn continue their investigation , but can only base on statements of witnesses taken by communist regime police in 1946 . 
  i do not understand , why we can make a full exhumation in cases such as katy\u0144 or srebrenica but not in the case of jedwabne . 
  imho it would help to find the objective truth . 
  i showed only few possibilities to show , that e-currency would not get rid of corruption . 
  of course you can fill the list with more examples . 
   that would be the end of 95 % of all corruption . 
  corruption can be done in many different ways - diamonds , gold , etc. 
  and electronic currency has its own disadvantages . 
   better women you mean more ` open minded ' , ` progressive ' , ` modern ' , ` undemanding ' , ` direct ' , ` uninhibited ' . 
  do you know any other synonyms of ` easy ' word ? 
   what the fuck mate ? 
  do you mean it 's overpaid ? 
  maybe he took a red pill . 
   `` hey , must have been a muslim right !, 
  watch out for the muslims , all of them are potential terrorists ! '', 
   `` this poor guy , he looked like a middle eastern men , he should not be treated differently ! '', 
  according to [ this ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/trojmiasto/gdansk-mowil-o-zamiarze-uzycia-bomby-urodzony-w-armenii-mezczyzna-musial-opuscic/pns6j4 ) a passenger accused him to talk about ` intention to use a bomb ' . 
  hope you are a minority . 
  and if any of poles living in lithuania from centuries is reading this - please be sure that we know and care about you . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/trojmiasto/gdansk-mowil-o-zamiarze-uzycia-bomby-urodzony-w-armenii-mezczyzna-musial-opuscic/pns6j4 ) a passenger accused him to talk about ` intention to use a bomb ' . 
  both were questioned , then they were released . 
  the man was apologised . 
  what would you do , being on duty at the airport , if a passenger accused someone of suspicious behavior ? 
  check him or let him go ? 
   now imaging poland with 600k net immigration from a poorer country each year . 
  [ ukrainian ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-poland-ukraine-idukkcn0uy2bn ) ambassaor in poland :  `` taking into account the number of visas in previous years , and the dynamics of the near-border movement , i suspect that over the course of a year there could be up to a million ukrainians on polish territory , '' and we have no problem with them . 
   mickiewicz considered himself as lithuanian and lithuania as his homeland , you mean the first verse of his ` pan tadeusz ' poem or was it more examples ? 
  i read about mi\u0142osz , that some of lithuanians and belorussian scietists considered him lithanian/belorusian too . 
   [ the prosecutor 's office takes criminal investigation against two of the portuguese perjury , of which one of them had to be in rzeszow victim of a racist incident .
