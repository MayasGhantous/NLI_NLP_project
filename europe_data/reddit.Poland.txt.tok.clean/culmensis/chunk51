    czes\u0142aw mi\u0142osz  he 's considered as polish poet . 
  why ? 
  what is the difference between mi\u0142osz and mickiewicz ? 
   lalalalalalala ca n't hear you over the loud music you 're playing in my car . 
  maybye you should use a soap . 
  i have no idea . 
  maybe they have different definitions of robbery - the same case as definition of rape . 
  and do n't stay at camps in germany during your trip . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/ba/robberies_recorded_by_the_police%2c_2002%e2%80%9312_yb14.png ) is eurostat data about robbery in eu . 
  this is a total number of recorded robberies . 
  for better outlook it should be computed per capita . 
  poland looks quite great at this criterion . 
   vietnamese were hunted and beaten up in cee . 
  any sources ? 
  good move imho . 
  stay strong romania . 
  imho , it was made to protect the german car industry . 
  or more correctly eu industry , becouse many countries participate in this one . 
  becouse of international treaties we can not ban other manufacturers , but we can make unreachable standards for engines and pretend that european engines fulfill them . 
  it was answer for :  i 'm starting to think you guys 'd better start learning the lyrics you stated :  the part which is controversial and here you have an answer . 
  which one shoiuld i post according to you ? 
   to arms , citizens ,  form your battalions ,  let 's march , let 's march !, 
   let an impure blood  soak our fields !, 
   to arms , citizens ,  form your battalions ,  let 's march , let 's march !,

  my grandma many years ago used to warn me : do n't go far away - the gypsies can hijack you . 
  at that time people were very xenophobic and racist . 
  herbata = = herba of tea . 
  i 'm not offended . 
  i just found it rude to be a guest and criticize a host . 
  have you any examples , that guest in white house criticize your government or president during official visits ? 
  i 'm not saying that the sentence is objective truth . 
  of course nor me nor bandera considered him as pole . 
  i 'm pointing , that using pc language may lead to a lie . 
  are you trying to say , that if you gave us something , than you are allowed to say or do whatever you want ? 
  in meaning that you have bought us ? 
  paradoxically , given the politically correct language used in europe today , this sentence is ~ ~ true ~ ~ correct . 
   also many ukrainians tend to get mad that the repressions against the ukrainian minority in the second polish republic ( like this ) i do n't want to say that there was no oppresion made by poles . 
  but in this particular case :  a committee of the league of nations in its response to ukrainian-nationalists protest regarding the `` pacification '' action , while not approving the methods used , stated that it was the ukrainian extremists themselves who were to be blame [ 11 ] for consciously inviting this response by their sabotage activities and maintained that it was not governmental policy of persecution of the ukrainian people . 
  i can talk about myself . 
  before internet era i had only warm feelings . 
  but then i saw articles from israeli newspapers , comments , / r/israel messages concerning poles , movies like [ defamation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opp3wvkymes ) and it changed slightly . 
  the number of victims of iiww with polish citizenship was 6 milion . 
  from that 3 milion jews . 
   honest question , are you saying that because you are counting polish jews as poles , or were catholic poles also killed en masse at auschwitz ? 
  if you would like to narrow victims of the wwii with polish citizenship only to auschwitz , then number of victims in criterion of nationality ( according to [ piper ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/auschwitz-birkenau#wi.c4.99.c5.baniowie_i_ofiary ) ) : - 960.000 jews , - 75.000 poles , - 21.000 roma , - 15.000 soviet pov , - 15.000 other . 
   poles killed the jews , not vice versa . 
  please do n't be so modest . 
  here you have some examples where jews killed poles during wwii : [ naliboki massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naliboki_massacre ) , [ koniuchy massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koniuchy_massacre ) . 
  and please do n't forget , that many jews collaborated with communists and are responsible for death of many poles . 
  some vip examples of jewish collaborators : [ salomon morel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salomon_morel ) , [ natan gr\u00fcnspan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_romkowski ) , [ anatol fejgin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anatol_fejgin ) , [ j\u00f3zef r\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_r%c3%b3%c5%bca%c5%84ski ) , [ julia brystiger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julia_brystiger ) , [ jakub berman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jakub_berman ) and many more . 
   nobody cares what a bunch of plumbers have to say , really . 
  will save it if / u/arabier would like to remove it . 
   [ poland where ] people ca n't even mention the word `` jew '' without feeling some sort of guilt . 
  any sources ? 
  and - seriously - it 's a very stupid statement . 
  imho for us and for v4 the best goal would be if you will stay in eu . 
  the whole anti-uk attitude is to show you the bad side of your decision . 
  your attitude is quite conservative - like ours . 
  now we are left with germany/france europe , which means federalized one , with strong rule of germany . 
  come back . 
  repeat this bloody referendum and come back . 
   in the 1930s , before the wwii , there was even a german-polish-french-british joint plan to resettle the european jews in madagascar . 
  this idea is much older . 
  jewish author - theodor herzl ( one of the creator of zionism ) in his ` der judenstaat ' was considered the possibility to create jewish state in madagascar . 
   somehow i was of a better opinion of the education in the netherlands ... 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/term/49,emigracja-zydow-z-polski ) in 68-70 period emigrated about 20.000 jews , while in 44-47 : 140.000 , 49 : 30.000 , 56-60 : 30.000 . 
  / u/wegwerpacc123 is right . 
  durring comunist time , especially at the beggining , it was wery hard to reach a passport for ` normal ' citizens . 
  passport that allows to go behind the ` iron curtain ' . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/term/49,emigracja-zydow-z-polski ) in 68-70 period emigrated about 20.000 jews , while in 44-47 : 140.000 , 49 : 30.000 , 56-60 : 30.000 . 
  [ shevah weiss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shevah_weiss ) - speaker of the israel 's knesset and israeli ambassador in poland - in his [ interview ] ( http://www.naszczas.pl/nasi-autorzy/polacy-i-zydzi-jutro-i-wczoraj ) with [ w\u0142adys\u0142aw bartoszewski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_bartoszewski ) asked :  ` what would you say to israeli people that do n't want to visit poland [ ... ] ? ', 
  bartoszewski answered :  ` please point another country european union , which in the past fifteen years , had three foreign ministers - geremek , rotfeld , meller , of jewish origin , and the fourth honorary citizen of the state of israel , minister of foreign affairs , who was in auschwitz . 
  please point a country in europe . ', 
  on the other hand we have many people of jewish origin in politics , media etc. 
  interesting fact is that wife of our current president [ andrzej duda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrzej_duda ) is of jewish origin . 
  [ she ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agata_kornhauser-duda ) is a doughter of [ julian kornhauser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julian_kornhauser ) - famous poet of jewish origin . 
  imho quite a big representation for ` nonexisting ' set of people . 
  why pilsudski is considered as murderer for ukrainians ? 
  honest question . 
  hope you are not trying to excuse rudeness justifying it by someone 's strength . 
  i know about that , but i wanted to make a simple comparison . 
  i did not want to build wall of text painting all the shades of gray . 
  for ukrainians bandera was a man fighting for independence . 
  it was not his order to kill poles in volhynia . 
  for us he is a bandit . 
  view of this person is different for poles and ukrainians . 
  one of other example is romual rajs ` bury ' . 
  for poles he is a hero fighting for independece , but for belarussian he is just a bandit , responsible for killing belarusian civilians . 
  and there is a movement in poland that want to give a part of highway in poland his name . 
  i hope that the store was insured . 
  today , president of ukraine petro poroshenko gave in warsaw tribute to the victims of crime volyn . 
  he laid flowers and lit a candle at the monument to victims of the crime . 
  i 'm not sure if it was the best moment to make such a statement . 
  ukraine is now in difficult position and imho we should support it . 
  maybe someone should buy him a book like savoir vivre for ... 
  i do n't know - presidents ? 
  that feeling when a guest in your house says that he did not like the decor . 
  sleeping in few people in one room . 
  working more than 8 hours a day .
