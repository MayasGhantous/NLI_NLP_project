  old good times , when i used to work in picking grapes in france as a student . 
  and i earned in three weeks more than my father ( engineer ) in 6 months ( early 90 ' ) . 
  so journalists said that , or listeners ? 
  such a statements sometimes occures , but what i know they are commented and not allowed . 
  it is the same as comments for example in gazeta wyborcza interent forum . 
  there is a lot of hate towards rydzyk from influential people , organisations and newspapers . 
  if he would incites hatred based on nationality ( which is punished by the polish penal code ) they will for sure sue him . 
  do you know such a case ? 
  on the other hand it is imho unfair to romanian to call them romanian and not just roma . 
  there was no poland or polish king in 1800 's for your information . 
  please read some sources , before spreading misinformation . 
  you mean a polish king from 1800 's ? 
  are you sure ? 
  which law do you mean ? 
  and for how long it was working if it was temporarily ? 
   anti-semitism was rife in ee for centuries that 's why jews chose poland to settle there ? 
   anti-semitism was immense in eastern europe and for centuries . 
  that 's why jews chose poland to settle there ? 
  article from [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lviv_pogroms ) . 
   and secret protocol is even one of the text you can get in a state exam to analyse . 
  this subject is discuted on russian website too ( pikabu.ru ) and there are many claims that this protocol is false . 
  so it is hard to believe that this is taught in schools . 
  exactly . 
  let 's not be a subject of old ` divide et impera ' slogan . 
  for me , personally , it is strange that current massmedia are able to do all that mess for uk . 
  uk - one of the leader of the world . 
  if they can do it for you - what can they do for weaker countries ? 
  stay strong uk . 
  i think it is mass-media propaganda with their goal to punish uk after voting for brexit . 
  they can choose and air issues to prove their thesis from all of the cases . 
  for example - cars with polish plates was burnt in berlin lately . 
  any journalist and ` reliable sources ' made a big issue about it ? 
  it 's really great . 
  thank you uk people . 
  i had the same impression when i read the comments on uk webpages concerning attacking poles after brexit voting . 
  but i have an impression , that we are driven by the issues that are aired in massmedia to show how uk is bad . 
  it was the same after poles dare to vote for pis government . 
  let 's calm down . 
  what i know from fellow poles living in uk - the attitude of locals did not change after brexit . 
  can someone confirm that ? 
  ` oh pretty , if you only are able to cook ' - said the farmer . 
  the czech republic . 
   considering indian and pakistanis beat out white natives there is little point trying to compare them with eastern europeans it is great that indian and pakistianis can be joined together in one team . 
  at least in uk  . 
  great for you - you can make one great country in indian penisula in the near future again , without religion , but based - for example on - traditional caste system . 
  it 's your choice . 
  i 'm just curious - do you share the same belonging to the castes in both countries , or muslim in pakistan got rid of that ? 
  i read your sources , and once again - can you give a source that prove that claim :  there are more educated tax paying muslims in the uk than polish people, 
  / s you are just a star at polandball that use stereotypes at daily purposes . 
  what fits over there usually not fits over here . 
  i just hope . 
   there are more educated tax paying muslims in the uk than polish people per capita or in absolute numbers ? 
  just curious . 
  have you got any sources ? 
  is this a prove for acctepting racism toward jews in poland ? 
  this man was found and prosecutor charged him with accusations of art . 
  256 paragraph 1 of the criminal code , namely public incitement to hatred based on race , which carries a penalty of two years in prison . 
   but in poland racism towards certain groups like jews for example is accepted . 
  any sources or examples ? 
  me too . 
  their statements are alike to the ` gulag ' by [ aleksandr solzhenitsyn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandr_solzhenitsyn ) . 
  it is hard to believe that the same things are conducted in modern times . 
  that is why i asked for sources . 
  good job hungary . 
  at least you are trying . 
   the pm of a country that gains money from the uk 's eu membership and has lots of immigrants living in the uk , sending money back you mean hungary or greece ? 
  thank you . 
  did not expect this from you . 
  do not worry . 
  there is always a bunch of people in every society like that . 
  that hate and this kind of feelings just powered them . 
  any sources ? 
  no offence . 
  truly interested . 
   put it as it makes you feel better . 
  i do n't have to like their ideology . 
  but hating could be dengerous - better try to lay on the level of understendig than feeling . 
   to start , i 'm against religious parties imho pis is not more religious than - for example - christlich demokratische union deutschlands . 
   and again , most of the critics i saw were about your government not about poland . 
  i 'm not sure if we are reading the same thread . 
  than it is your own problem . 
   all i can do is to criticize the actions and the ideology of pis . 
  so - what are you literally criticize ? 
  cuz it seems that this news about voting is fake , and it triggered whole bunch of europeans to express their true feelings about poland . 
   because i 've never been to poland . 
  that is interesting . 
  you are welcome to poland . 
  you could draw conclusions from the first hand . 
   lol , wild hate . 
  people do n't have to like the ideology and the actions of a political party . 
  as far as i understand , this message about voting is fake . 
  but it gives opportunity to express feelings about poland and it 's democraticaly voted government here in / r/europe . 
  let 's look for the first few messages here : 1 . 
  [ backwards countries ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ou8df/poland_together_with_russia_iran_and_several_gulf/d4ftugr ) 2 . 
  [ it 's a right wing extremist shithole that 's in the process of turning into a fascist state under guidance of the usa . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ou8df/poland_together_with_russia_iran_and_several_gulf/d4fxqy4 ) - really nice and smart conclusion from austria . 
  [ poland 's brand of religion is nationalistic , xenophobic , conservative and not very tolerant of the others . 
  the others being foreigners , different ethnicity , skin color , religion , you name it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ou8df/poland_together_with_russia_iran_and_several_gulf/d4fsjyj ) - comes from polish user that would like to be more progressive . 
  [ i feel like poland has these bursts of crazy .
