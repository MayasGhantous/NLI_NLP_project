  [ so , once again , i can reset to zero number of days since i was ashamed of my own country . 
  for fuck 's sale . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ou8df/poland_together_with_russia_iran_and_several_gulf/d4fpkgi ) - polish one this time . 
  [ when i see these particular countries mentioned in the same sentence with poland , it 's a sad reflection of how far back poland has gone since the ** midget ** `` re-took '' office ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ou8df/poland_together_with_russia_iran_and_several_gulf/d4fngza ) - polish smart one . 
  really ? 
  do you really support this oppinions ? 
  sure . 
  but criticism should lay on facts , i suppose . 
  and not on wild hate . 
  agree . 
  they seem to hate democratically elected government and take literally every opportunity - even fake - to openly throw a shit at them . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i just asked about sources - is this ` polish ' behaviour ? 
  exactly . 
  probably the whole ` news ' is taken from statement of one particular man - from ` behind the scenes ' . 
  and not describe exact behaviour of polish delegation at onz but his personal oppinion . 
  please put attention at all the messages here in / r/europe comming from ` true europeans ' that represent ` smartnes ' but seems to be bunch of hipocrytes and people using biased stereotypes . 
  probably . 
  but look at the whole bunch of people here , that take their opportunity to openly hate . 
  pathetic . 
  at least we can marry someone without considering his/her [ religion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marriage_in_israel ) . 
  anyone has a reliable source of it ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://pikio.pl/polska-rosja-i-iran-ramie-w-ramie-przeciw-rezolucji-onz-dekryminalizujacej-homoseksualizm ) polish foreign ministry declared , that they supported eu point of view . 
   poland took an active part in the work on a political statement in the fight against hiv/aids . 
  polish position during the negotiations was included in a joint eu position . 
  poland at the un did not voted in the national character ( individually ) in the present declaration . 
  hope so . 
  but it is about consequences . 
  you can not be pregnant only a little bit . 
  so - our youngers will be fighting the isis . 
  but along with us against bashar al-assad , or along with russia supporting bashar al-assad ? 
  who is bad this time ? 
  let 's stay at home - it is not our war . 
   polish authorities should be more strict about what you export ... 
  i think the recipient decides whether he/she wants to buy the product or not . 
  if your health authorities admit to trading the goods , it must meet the criteria of your healthcare services . 
  here is result of searching for czechs food , from the same webpage : http://www.potravinynapranyri.cz/search.aspx?ext=y&amp;scustlocradius=2&amp;sorigincountry=51&amp;lang=cs&amp;design=default&amp;archive=archive&amp;listtype=tiles, 
  czechs buy polish food at a cheap price segment . 
  do not forget also that a major food producer in the czech republic is a private company owned by oligarch and finance minister - [ andrej babi\u0161 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrej_babi%c5%a1 ) . 
  he also owns newspapers and television channel . 
  his interest is present competitive products in a bad light . 
   you have the funniest presidents no - we have : 1 . 
  [ drunk president kwasniewski ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8n_eg7jj5u ) on the graves of polish officers killed by communists . 
  previous president komorowski [ jumping on chair ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rml5kw-lz34 ) destinated for vips in japanese parlament and shouting to our general : ` come here [ shogun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shogun ) ' . 
  we are not worse . 
  the first country that would implement decent basic income ... 
  add some beautifull bulgarian folk music . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_gm0j1h1kc ), 
  or in [ 1939 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak_invasion_of_poland_\\ ( 1939 \\ ) ) . 
  becouse we have many ` pshe ' phrases . 
  russians call as ` psheki ' becouse of it . 
  i find it cool . 
  sitting in their own palaces and telling ordinary people how to live . 
  good . 
  let 's just stop that madness . 
  it is pity that the same bunch of people was not so vocal when previous government started to spoil the constitutional court . 
  i 'm not looking at that kod movement . 
  for me it is just a bunch of flocks of sheep that are lead by controversial leaders that lost their power . 
  for me this people is just a cattle . 
  i just hope that leaders will not use this cattles to goal their needs . 
  as they previously proclaimed . 
  you can google how much they earned for every episod from our tax money . 
   protest = / = maidan now thank you for that . 
  i think - you are right . 
  we should not let the ` lost people ' to ignite poland - just because they lost the last democratic elections . 
  tomasz lis that had his own series of program in national tv - payed by tax payers money or journallists from gazeta wyborcza that had their announcement from government too . 
  now they have to live without it . 
  and it could be painful . 
   that 's not there goal . 
  really ? 
  so what is their goal ? 
   source ? 
  for what / u/lobesmu ? 
  really ? 
  but if he wants to be janukowich , he must know - in warsaw will be the maidan . 
  said the influetnial journalist that loose his job paid from previous government money . 
  which one ? 
  i assume you 're asking me to give sources ? 
  you could find yourself by googling - but here you are : 1 . 
  tomasz lis - journalist openly hating the current government - [ ` it will be the maidan in warsaw ' ] ( https://twitter.com/lis_tomasz/status/669622878015528964 ) 2 . 
  i hope that the grandparents would not manage to set fire to poland . 
  just because they do not like the democratically elected government . 
  talking about facts could be painful in / r/europe . 
  hope it would be not like in ` talk of the devil -- and the devil appears ' . 
  exactly that is their goal . 
  change the government for every price . 
  without taking into account the consequences . 
  why you assume that they do not have the opportunity to protest and express their needs ? 
  of course they could . 
  and they did . 
  and nobody was oppressed for this . 
  it does not change the fact that the protests are organized by the ideologues of the previous government and the people who lost power . 
  opposition leaders and journalists openly supporting the previous government are calling to do maidan in poland . 
  that is their goal . 
  i hope that they will fail to set fire on poland . 
   after all what can they do anyway maybe just eu commision should issue a report critical of the state of the rule of law in french under the country 's jean-marc ayrault government .

  looking at the tv sets , it seems that pictures are quite old . 
   the stereotypical arab is a spice merchant .
