  the stereotypical slav is a communist . 
  and stereotypical german ? 
  what are they like ? 
  and oh my god - communist ? 
  slaves are a communists ? 
  - oh please man . 
  a little bit of literature please . 
  you mean person like marks ? 
  - the famous slaves ? 
  movement like weimar rebublic ? 
  please read about 1920 year and fitght between communist russia and poland that saves you - the germany from communist movement . 
  now please apologise . 
  are you a real german with all the schollar system or just an immigrant without education ? 
  just another hit for poland from people that was pushed apart from governing in poland . 
   11000 + animal species and 5500 + plant species are about to lose their home . 
  here 's a petition you can sign . 
  what ` animal species ' and ` plant species ' are you talking about ? 
  you mean the total population of species or different kind of 1oooo species ? 
  please specify what species are you talking about and what is the population of that spacie . 
  i 'm polish and for me the results seems to be quite different . 
  examples : sweden : ` szwecja jest ' ( ` sweden is ' ) : in nato , in eu , shengen ` szwedzi s\u0105 ' ( swedish are ' ) : strange , handsome , tall . 
  ukraine : ` ukraina jest ' : ( ukraine is ) : in europe , in nato , in eu ` ukrai\u0144cy s\u0105 ' : ( ukrainians are ) : in the center of luhansk , handsome . 
  i 'm not sure who needs more [ vocal exercises ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gucnujhrx0 ) - washing machine or a rooster . 
  i 'm not sure if you have [ seen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a43joxla5mm ) that before . 
  yes . 
  we are not far-right over here . 
  they are . 
  over there . 
   good thing the polish government has such a stellar reputation when it comes to upholding the law then ... 
  i do n't know how it works in your country , but in poland for prosecution of law is responsible the judiciary and not the government . 
  i do not know how it 's working today , but during comunist time in poland it was the only alternative of our official propaganda . 
  you can be prisoned to hear that . 
  if your neighbours would snick you . 
  many polish fighters for freadom , that escaped from poland were brodcasting there . 
  it was the only small pice of freadom at that time . 
  thank yo rfe for you job . 
   are you questioning geography ? 
  do you like geography ? 
  me too . 
  imagine a globe with a diameter of 4 meters . 
  please imagine that you lie down on it so that your heart was in the middle of europe . 
  let 's say - in berlin . 
  now - if you perform the movements of your arms - what is on your left hand is called west , and what the right - east . 
  by which hand you reach , say - finland ? 
  for me it is understandable . 
  you have your own island , your country and you have right to be not welcomed to the big influx of us . 
  on the other hand - we have big influx of ukrainians lately and they are welcomed here . 
  maybe it is caused by the fact , that we have also , like ukrainians , big emmigration movement , or that they were part of common country and are similar to us . 
   fine in western/northern europe . 
  not sure about eastern europe . 
  eastern europe responding : it is fine here to be an atheist . 
  at least no one will cut off your head because of it . 
  just like in some countries . 
   a group of students was asked if they were syrians by a local gang a few days after . 
  do you have any more reliable source than those that publicized the original case ? 
  you want to start comparing the number of attacks in poland and in so called western europe on the basis of skin color ? 
  where do you think there were more issues ? 
  not to mention that the case , which you say seems to be just a lie . 
   they hate themselves . 
  we do n't hate ourselves . 
  we can objectively state , that there are wealthier countries than poland and live can be easier over there . 
  i noted - i just found it on few first links from googling , to ilustrate my thesis . 
  if you need newer data , you can compare it with article / u/lilputput linked [ above ] ( http://www.jahonline.org/article/s1054-139x\\ ( 14 \\ ) 00387-5 \\ / fulltext #sec 2 ) . 
  sadly , they are comparable . 
   you 'd need to find adolescent abortion rates . 
  i bet percentages would be different . 
  from source i linked :  per 1000 women 15 -- 19 ( years old ) . 
  i know - but it is hard to compare countries that prohibit and allows abortions . 
  found birth and abortion rates , 1996 per 1000 women 15 -- 19 , ( % aborted = % of teenage pregnancies ending in abortion ) source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_teenage_pregnancy#birth_and_abortion_rates.2c_1996 | country | birth rate | abortion rate | combined rate | % aborted | | :-| - :| - :| - :| - :| | netherlands | 7.7 | 3.9 | 11.6 | 33.6 | | spain | 7.5 | 4.9 | 12.4 | 39.5 | | italy | 6.9 | 6.7 | 13.3 | 50.4 | | greece | 12.2 | 1.3 | 13.5 | 9.6 | | belgium | 9.9 | 5.2 | 15.1 | 34.4 | | germany | 13.0 | 5.3 | 18.3 | 28.9 | | finland | 9.8 | 9.6 | 19.4 | 49.5 | | ireland | 16.7 | 4.6 | 21.3 | 21.6 | | france | 9.4 | 13.2 | 22.6 | 58.4 | | denmark | 8.2 | 15.4 | 23.6 | 65.3 | | sweden | 7.7 | 17.7 | 25.4 | 69.7 | | norway | 13.6 | 18.3 | 31.9 | 57.4 | | czech republic | 20.1 | 12.4 | 32.5 | 38.2 | | iceland | 21.5 | 20.6 | 42.1 | 48.9 | | slovakia | 30.5 | 13.1 | 43.6 | 30 | | australia | 20.1 | 23.9 | 44 | 54.3 | | canada | 22.3 | 22.1 | 44.4 | 49.8 | | israel | 32.0 | 14.3 | 46.3 | 30.9 | | united kingdom | 29.6 | 21.3 | 50.9 | 41.8 | | new zealand | 33.4 | 22.5 | 55.9 | 40.3 | | hungary | 29.9 | 30.2 | 60.1 | 50.2 \\ | romania | 40.0 | 37.9 | 77.9 | 48.7 | | united states | 55.6 | 30.2 | 85.8 | 35.2 |, 
  does it count number of abortions ? 
  but if the bully was from different race that white , than it could be called racist ? 
   i wo n't take a single step in europe because of shit like this . 
  not too far in the future , i feel like i 'll have to start fearing for my life , especially with the far right gaining more popularity . 
  i do not want to be rude - but please - just make a first step and come out of your room . 
  you will see that the world is just beautiful and your fears is just an imagination . 
  from north to south , the names of your countries are sorted alphabetically . 
  ( e , la , li - by the way - not bad name - ` elali ' in place of ` baltic states '  . 
  judging by the number of such films and links posted on reddit by romanians they seem a little masochistic ... more seriously - sorry for opinion expressed in this footage - it 's just an ignorancy . 
  imho for all this confusion is to blame the pc , representing the roma as romanians . 
  we are still slaves for us too - but i doubt that ` the slavs will ball you out again ' ... 
  i think it 's high time to admit that the policy of ` open borders ' was a mistake . 
  as well as intimidation of countries that did not want to participate in this madness . 
  imho it is the high time for eu to find a solution based on intelect - not emotions - and respect for the law . 
   well the real slavs i mean then probably more east . 
  unfortunately . 
   ah the matriarchy finally catching up to young european men . 
  hang in there guys , it 's gon na be a bumpy ride . 
  maybe the slavs will bail you out again . 
  all i can see among my family and friends is that scary domination of matriarchy . 
  it sounds similarly in most european languages - thus it is probably much older word - maybe from protoindoeuropean language . 
  [ farsi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persian_language ) belongs to the indo-european languages family . 
  i 'm trying but it gets here . 
  to this deleted thread . 
  i do n't have any questions - i just appreciate your censorship work . 
  do you like it ? 
  you can ban me again . 
  you can ban even all of us . 
  but you will stay only with your biased friends . 
  for a while . 
  without comprehendig the people from the real world .
