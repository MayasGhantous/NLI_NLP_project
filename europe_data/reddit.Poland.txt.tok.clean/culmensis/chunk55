  it 's preatty interesting if lithuanians have common roots with semitic languages . 
  our - european ( in most cases ) - languages comes from common root : [ protoindoeuropean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-indo-european_language ) language . 
  do you suggest that lithuanian has something common with semitic languages based on pre-protoindoeuropean times ? 
  russia - vladimir putin - meaning : vladi - leading ; mir - peace ; -  leading of peace  putin -  someting connected to route ; czech - milo\u0161 zeman - meaning : milo\u0161 : someone who is loved ; zeman : something from german : have no idea what , but dengerous  croatia - kolinda grabar-kitarovi\u0107 - meaning : kolinda - i have no idea - probably it is not slav name ; serbia - tomislav nikoli\u0107 - meaning : tomiti - torture , torment ; slav - glory ; -  someone tortured by glory ; or someone that tortured others by his glory ; bulgaria - rosen plevneliev - probably not slav name . 
  i know that all of the names sound like a ` broken condom ' etc. 
  but please consider that other names common in europe has also bizzare genesis . 
  please see paul , adam , eve , michael , kevin etc. 
  is n't is hebrew in origin ?

   fundamentalist islam is just a step worse than fundamentalist christianity . 
  really ? 
  do christians kill non-believers , becouse it gives them the ticket to a heaven ? 
  do they kill people becouse of their sexuality ? 
  do they kill people becouse of pre-muslim , tribe rules and imagination of family honour ? 
  can you really put an equal sign between fundamentalist christianity and fundamentalist islam ? 
  it seems that in poland we have no data in nationality factor . 
  it would be interesting to see how much for example narcotics crimes or human trafficing were done by different nationalities . 
  exactly . 
  it seems to be another theory of relativity trying to excuse and equal every behaviour . 
  it 's just an another example of desired vibrating multiculturalism . 
  they seem to look for a far away purpose that is quite close . 
  none of that cities is in our part of europe . 
  anyway you are welcome . 
  you are right that it is hard and stupid to blame the 6-month old government for everything bad . 
   you replied to : `` and it 's not going to get any better [ ... ] '' no . 
  i did n't want to judge any predictions or divinations . 
  maybe he is right , maybe not . 
  i do n't know . 
  hard to say . 
  i just replied to ` cutting down bia\u0142owie\u017ca ' - when it is about the parasites living in there , ` evil gmo ' , ` chemistrals ' , ` current government ' and all of this buzzwords that are emotional and are not merit . 
  but you as a german - is it not strange for you that this message is keep in / r/europe subreditt for few hours without sources ? 
  when other posts are deleted at once and users are banned ? 
  i will be banned for that few sentences probably like last time - farewell my friend . 
  hope it will be another 30-days punishment or not permanent . 
  anyway - stay strong . 
  i 'm trying to ask for the source again . 
  there is no source for this data for few hours . 
  are sources important for this subreddit ? 
  it sounds like an accusation  - i did not vote for them fyi . 
  i just do n't like the exposing of prejudice and hatred . 
  we still do n't know the source of this data . 
  the title suggest that this was measured for 1-year periods . 
  this hated government was elected 6 month ago . 
  i know that it is easy to blame them for everything - it is funny and modern , but could we just talk about the rationality ? 
  for example - what is the source for that data ? 
  if pm2 .5 factor is more important than for example no or pm10 factors ? 
  or we should just draw the only smart conclusion that it is fault of pis government ? 
  yes everything is worse from few months but could you please stop posting your political agenda in every message ? 
  maybe you are right . 
  but the op data has no source yet and if it is even reliable , it is based only on one factor - the pm2 .5 . 
  i 'm sure that we can draw different conclusion based on other factors - such as pm10 , co , no , formaldehyde etc. 
  overall estimation of pollution in eu is in the second link from my previous post . 
  you must admit that it looks differently . 
  what is the source ? 
  i was trying to find it and i googled this : [ air pollution in europe : real-time air quality index visual map ] ( http://aqicn.org/map/europe/#@g/48.9213/9.0604/6z ) and this : [ europe pollution index ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/pollution/region_rankings.jsp?title=2016&amp;region=150 ), 
  according to [ central limit theorem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_limit_theorem ) to perform the poll and predict the arithmetic mean , the set of asked person should be randomized . 
  it means - let 's ask 1000 people - but they should be choosen randomly 1000 people from population . 
  and not let them answering by themselfs . 
  i was looking at the methodology and found [ this ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lord-ashcroft-polls-you-should-hear-what-they-say-about-you-eu28-poll-report-feb-2016.pdf ) . 
  i 'm not a statistician but the metodology in this document is described as this :  28,720 adults throughout the eu were interviewed online between 20 january and 1 february 2016 . 
  imho it is not enough accurate description to draw conclusions about the validity of research . 
  it could be done for example by online survey that was published on a website . 
  information about the website could be spread into particular set of internet users and for sure could not be reliable . 
  to be reliable they should be randomized for whole populations . 
  hope this helps - romanians . 
  there are asian men too . 
  shame on you sweden . 
  how could you ? 
  ^ ^ ^ / sss, 
  austria or australia ? 
  be precise please - where from expects [ iskanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ol%c4%99drzy ) ? 
  i lived in poland under soviet rule and under our own rule . 
  believe me - it is not comparable . 
  and we are not learning , but we are forgetting quickly . 
  and it is good . 
   first of all there are twice as much polish users than german users subscribed in / r/europe . 
  just curious only about this one sentence . 
  i was trying to find sources for that claim for a while , and i have found only this : http://mind314.github.io/europeusers/ have you got any other sources ? 
  that may be truth . 
  jewish minority in poland was not integrated to our society . 
  most of them not even speak polish despite of living among us for few hundred years . 
  this community was diversed . 
  some of them were well integrated - they were poets , writers , doctors etc. 
  but most of them was orthodoxiously religious one , living in their own environment . 
  it is the same diversity in todays israel - they have religious part called ` haredim ' that refuse to integrate to the rest of society and are spending time to learn sacred books and religion . 
  in poland before wwii they were the majority . 
   nevertheless a lot of people were ( and still are ) hiding their jewish origins you mean in poland or worldwide ? 
  you mean the local news about rzesz\u00f3w ? 
  there are many different types of journalists and activists with different attitudes and goals in poland . 
  some of them are very vocal about any cases that can describe poles as racist and xenophobic - cases that can be used as stereotypical generalisation . 
  fortunately ( for us - poles and for you portuguese ) it seems that in this case it was their mistake . 
  on the other hand - it is pity that this probably fake incident was publicized in portugal , poland , reddit etc. 
   says it 's local news . 
  did n't know that was against the rules . 
  this rule seems not to work in some cases : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gf6zp/portuguese_student_victim_of_racist_attack_in/, 
  step first : acknowledge the problem and name it . 
  i do not have the data . 
  but we like living in multi-age houses with our moms - like italians , 
  it seems that in poland even cctv are racist or xenophobic . 
  there were many details in the previous one too .
