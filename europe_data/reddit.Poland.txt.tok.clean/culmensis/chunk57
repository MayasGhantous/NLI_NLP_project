   she complained to her friend she was working with a 21-year-old syrian who constantly confesses her love and torments her . 
  a friend of hers defended jola in the media , claiming that he had not linked to muhamed any romance - as some have suggested . 
  on the day of his death , on july 24 , jola called agnieszka and revealed that she was afraid of muhammad because he behaved like a drunk . 
  after that the man attacked few other people with the knife - it 's hard to believe that they were also his girls or boy friends . 
  my grandmother lived in a small village . 
  i was there on holiday . 
  it was a great time . 
  the life cycle was determined by the buses stopping at the stop visible from the window . 
  my grandma 's life-cycle and conversations were intertwined with the arrival and departure times of the buses . 
  for example - ` when it was ' - she asked ? 
  ` just 10 minutes before bus to ... departured ' - someone answered . 
  but when there were disturbances of this cycle - she and her friends began to be excited : is it an accident or is the bus broke down or something else has happened ? 
   understandable , i am just curious about this subs thoughts on the matter . 
  me too . 
  hope it will not be banned and censored . 
  please do n't be sorry . 
  this sub is just heavily moderated . 
  question like yours can be seem equally honest , brave , but also just like an provocation . 
  and i think i should add the ' / s ' at the end of 1-st point . 
   given the constant terrorist attacks , lack of caring from the governments or the political left , and the state of the eu , do you think that europe is in for a collapse ? 
  not sure if it 's a fake post from censorship to ban ` right-wing ' users of this sub . 
  polish former prime minister , leszek miller [ said ] ( https://ndie.pl/leszek-miller-angela-merkel-zlamala-prawo-europejskie ) :  europe has changed its attitude to refugees too late . 
  we are dealing with the enemy . 
  this enemy is called radical islam . 
  and it is with us in our house . 
   angela merkel is responsible for the situation . 
   she individually , without any authorization from other eu countries , broke the asylum procedure , broke european law , opened arms wide and said : come . 
  and today , desperately , germany and other countries are trying to limit this problem . 
  i do n't like former communists but in this case imho miller was right . 
  for me , her children never heard about the ` second generation holocaust syndrome ' . 
  they could draw some money for themselves . 
  and maybe even the grandma would have something from that ? 
  some kind of submarine or a donation for usa holocaust survivours ? 
  so where in eu is the cheapest internet and how to buy the card ? 
   i understand why germans do what they do so - why ? 
  just curious . 
  are there any estimates of how many people ( family members ) it can be for a single refugee ? 
  yet another proof that we are living in the last days / s. 
   we have plenty of information about that era and fapping to the soviet past is n't too popular in russia even though some people fall for it . 
  i have an account on pikabu.ru , watching russian chanels and accounts , have google maps with all the russian ` lieninskaya ulica ' and monuments of lenin in every city/village in ` deep ' russia ( glubinka ) . 
  so - let me not agree with your thesis . 
  ukraine was an atomic power . 
  after the declaration of independence ukraine had nuclear weapons . 
  the united states , russia and the united kingdom have guaranteed territorial integrity of ukraine in the so-called [ budapest memorandum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) . 
  instead , ukraine committed itself to transfer their strategic nuclear weapons to russia and access to the [ treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_non-proliferation_of_nuclear_weapons ) . 
  imho ukraine is a good example - how much memoranda are worth to be convinced not so long after signing them . 
   nobody will recognise it ( unlike ` holodomor ' ) . 
  imho everybody will recognise it . 
  just stop worshiping of communist times and make a solid research about that times . 
   ` the targeted genocide of the russian people ' . 
  you should do that imho . 
  it 's just a fact . 
  our neighbour . 
  we once formed a great state together . 
  some of bad but also lot 's of good behavior on each side . 
  i hope the balance is positive for both sides . 
  and that it will be in the future . 
  from today 's perspective - a lot of ukrainians live , learn and work today in poland . 
  they are similar to us and easy to integrate . 
  they are liked and appreciated imho . 
  none of my friends speak the wrong word about ukrainians . 
  the only negative reviews are seen on the internet on sites like youtube . 
  my condolences . 
  stay safe . 
  praise our new lord of europe .

  slava !, 
  how do you know that they are from ee ? 
  looking at the bottles it 's from spain [ manantiales agua eden ] ( http://www.aguaeden.es/acerca-de-nosotros/que-nos-preocupa/eden-y-el-medioambiente/manantiales-agua-eden/?utm_source=www.google.pl&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content= ) water . 
  we at ee do n't know what is the \u00c9vian and drink water from backyard wells or from a taps ( if someon can afford a cannalisation )  . 
  you are talking smart things here . 
  on the high level of science . 
  from my oppinion the reality is quite at the level of the ground . 
  poland has bad press and international oppinion from 1.5 years ago . 
  when we dared to choose government that is not colegues with juncker and their cohortes . 
   yes i see that alot . 
  its like they are drilled into believing the more east you go the shitter the country . 
   and then they try politics to justify it . 
  by ` they ' do you mean slovenia - romania relationship ? 
   yes , you suggested that other countries than poland should do something to improve the attitudes poland has brought onto itself . 
  than my bad . 
  i can suggest that also poland should do something to improve our self-attitude . 
  imho - romania is the new poster boy of eu . 
  use your chance . 
   poland is entitled to anyones respect did i say something like that ? 
   i ask , why ? 
  it 's not only erasmus . 
  it 's also this sub imho . 
  the same situations and issues are judged differtialy dependable if it is poland or some other country . 
  is it - let 's say - polonophobia ? 
  or just anti-polonism ? 
  what is your opinion and what can be done to improve this attitude in your country ? 
  ( beside changng the polish gov - it 's in the next 2 years , 
   is scotland a nation ? 
  of course - from [ xiii century ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pdo7wfykti&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=72 ) [ nsfw ] . 
   it was 20 years ago you are right poland supports ukraine - from begining of modern ukraine until now imho . 
   im talking about current situation and from your previous posts :  poland does n't care about wellbeing of ukraine , we all know it , you simply need people to work , it 's not bad , but it 's not because u ' r so altruistic , do n't try to sell this  psheks are just ` hitriye ' people - like foxes , none should trust them - they only thinks how to cheat and steal from others . 
  short answer : 300 belarussian new rubles is \u2245 150 euro or \u2245 $ 160 .
