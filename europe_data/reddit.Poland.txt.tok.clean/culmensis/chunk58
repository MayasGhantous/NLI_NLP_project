   poland does n't care about wellbeing of ukraine , we all know it , you simply need people to work , it 's not bad , but it 's not because u ' r so altruistic , do n't try to sell this  that is simply not true . 
  for example , i remember the controversial decision of president kwa\u015bniewski not to agree to build the jamal ii gas-pipeline . 
  because it would be ommiting ukraine and it could be used to blackmail ukraine by russia . 
  it was in 1999 - at that time there was no ukrainian workers in poland . 
  consequence of this decision is the decision of building the north stream - that is a real threat to poland . 
   president of san escobar . 
  please tell me if you know an example of a politician from germany ever slip of the tongue ? 
  what was the funniest such a case ? 
  and how long did it take to sneer ? 
   at least he was never openly xenophobic in front of the camera . 
  just like the whole pis is - right ? 
   turns out you can criticize the eu and still be a very respected politician internationally . 
  sikorski is not only respected internationally ( but lithuanians and belarusians imho ) but also in polish political market . 
  during his not so long cv he was a minister at all political parties spectrum . 
  imho . 
  and beside of that i like him . 
  and on the other hand - do n't you think , that his joke about obama when he was fm of poland would be blown away if it would be told by current fm - waszczykowski ? 
   i would just like to know what the hell is eu doing ? 
  we have talks about `` self-reliance '' while the union is actually acting in the exact opposite way . 
  it 's working very hard to hand russia control over bigger energy flows than ever before to europe , while turkey is basically controlling a large chunk of refugee flows . 
  good question . 
  but you ca n't answering like that . 
  because you can fall under the threat of being called : 1 . nationalistic , 2 . fascist , 3 . rascist , 4 . xenophobic , 5 . you want to exit eu , 6 . you do n't want to cooperate . 
  like our current polish gov. 
  but thank you for being brave . 
   at least he did n't lock poland out of the room before voting . 
  imho he meant that we have a law . 
  we have a procedures . 
  procedures for voting for example : who is for , who is against , who abstained . 
  the voting with only ` who is against ' guestion is imho breaking the law . 
  it can build the feeling , that the whole eu is just a bunch of colegues that are ruling and do n't need any rules or laws . 
  they are beyond that . 
  hope it 's not a true . 
   even though during most of the interview he 's idiotic and basically against germany because `` nyeeeeh '' , the last two replies seem to show some sanity . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  just curious . 
  thank you for the source . 
  we can relay not only on the clickbait title . 
  it would be interesting to hear opinions from other ee ( ce ) countries about this interview . 
   inb4 poles talking about how they are being `` raped economically '' by everyone / s not by everyone but by germany . 
  and not poland but everyone . 
  even usa , 
  there is many fake stories like that about poland last time . 
  such as that one that our gov is anti eu and support exit , or this one from now . 
  people got excited by titles , then comes official dementi ( clarification ) that none cares . 
  why it 's done ? 
  and now poles from this sub will tell you that it is not such a good news . 
   all the media outlet of pis will focus on foreigners being the problem and how tusk wanted to bring foreigners . 
  could you give some examples ? 
   government controlling price of products [ ... ] , pis has started to do so . 
  examples ? 
  i 'm not a fan of pis - just curious . 
  as a child i had a post stamps from malta in my collection - it was great and valuable ( for me and my colleagues at that times ) . 
   the center of europe imho it 's just right next to [ paris of the east ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_of_the_east ) and [ venice of the north ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venice_of_the_north ) . 
  every country has it 's own ` the center of europe ' - except , maybe portugal , 
   better join the crowd and laugh your ass off for a good time . 
  is there any [ barrier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9yndirqwt4 ) ? 
  it 's just pathetic . 
  i 'm really ashamed that this kind of people are in charge in eu . 
  hope we will get rid all of the people from 68 circlejerk from today 's ruling class . 
  yea i know . 
  we had many examples of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9yndirqwt4 ) . 
  it 's just funny , 
  it 's just pathetic . 
  i 'm really ashamed that this kind of people are in charge in eu . 
  hope we will get rid all of the 68 hippies from today 's ruling class . 
   i was referring to the cities that are now polish . 
  i 'm looking at your source , and can see that the city that were german during partition and now is polish , was not the cheapest regions in europe , and especially amongst german cities . 
   they will try to pose as the victims afterwards . 
  imho it 's the same in poland . 
  but in poland mainstream media describe it as poles fault . 
  for example the title of an article - [ ` battue in limanowa ( a city name ) . 
  there are no arabs ? 
  where roma people were described as peacefull people and poles as offenders . 
  but [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2gcs0gpid4 ) is a footage from this issue . 
   italy and poland for example had much cheaper workforce at that time . 
  at that time ( late 19th century ) there was no poland , mate . 
  you and some other countries partitioned us ... . 
  have you got any context for the video ? 
  is this a fight between gypsy and gad\u017ei or between two clans ? 
  it 's worth to change it for something like [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz_qnai-m3k ) imho  . 
  in whose competence is the implementation of sanctions in the eu ? 
  german chancellor or any democratic institution of eu ? 
  also , let us not forget that the german chancellor 's upcoming elections are coming up in september . 
  we will see many `` strong and hard '' statements both from merkel and schulz imho . 
  if scotland will be independent and will join the eu there 's a chance that other part of uk will join it too . 
  from my pov eu is better with you . 
  maybe pimps leave for their human trafficking-workers less then 1-2 % ? 
  who knows ? 
  adding another one zero to his account . 
  imho it does n't matter . 
  i 'm glad that he do n't sell t-shirts with slogans etc. 
   i mean , its the pope !, 
  no , no , no - here is the real and the only [ pope ] ( http://www.radiowarszawa.com.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/janpawelii.jpg ) . 
  hope scotland and wales will make the referendum and in consequence the whole uk will be back to eu . 
  and hegemony of germany in eu will be limited . 
   i think they wanted to make a sacrifice to calm the aryan god , though they probably forgot that he favors gays , jews , gypsies and some other folk i forgot , not sheeps  / s more seriously - for modern western world the holocaust is the main tragedy being a consequence of wwii ( i 'm not trying to judge - just describing facts ) . 
  it is the biggest issue even now - we are not talking about other victims - the holocaust tragedy is most recognisable . 
  in jewish religion , when the [ temple ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temple_in_jerusalem ) existed , during pesach every jewish family should kill a ' [ sacrifical lamb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passover_sacrifice ) ' to memorize the exodus from egipt , when jews marked their lintels and door posts by blood of a lamb to avoid of wrath of god . 
  they could get naked to show that they had no weapon and are defenseless .
