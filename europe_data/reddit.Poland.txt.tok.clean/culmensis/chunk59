  so - imho they are trying to compare the ukrainian war - where defenseless civilians are killed to the holocaust and the fate of jewish people . 
  but it 's just mine interpreatation . 
   yeah but why kill a sheep ? 
  why in that location ? 
  why naked ? 
  [ too many questions ] ( https://www.mememaker.net/static/images/memes/4585955.jpg ) ... edit : seriously - i have no idea . 
  the only information published by now in polish media is that their were protesting against war in ukraine . 
  what is the symbol of particular movements was not explained . 
  maybe it was a ` performance ' made by artists ? 
  who knows . 
  so many questions , 
   does anyone have any idea what this is all about ?? 
  from the article :  some polish media say the action was a protest against the war in ukraine , the bbc warsaw correspondent adam easton reports . 
  from article :  several people have been reported injured after what has been described as a mass shooting in the french city of lille . 
  at least three people , including a 14-year-old , were injured , according to reports . 
   portugal je slavija try to remember all from this marvelous times - you will have something important to talk to your grandchildren . 
  how it was great when you were young , and poland was poorer than portugal , 
   it 's cheaper because one does n't have to pay transit fees and without transit countries one can not be blackmailed through withhold gas . 
  imho our both governments are trying to achieve the best for their own countries - but unfortunately only our is called nationalistc because of that . 
  my previous message that was deleted by auto-censor : ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  that 's so wrong it 's not even false . 
  let 's look at my statement ` their industry needs more people . 
  thus merkel invited people . 
  now they want to send the ones that has no education to our part of eu . ', 
  and divide it into 3 parts : 1 . 
  ` their industry needs more people . ', 
  from germany sources - via googling :  according to a 2011 study conducted by the nuremburg-based institute for employment research , given the current shortage of skilled labor and the shrinking german population , the country 's labor force is expected to drop by almost 7 million by 2025 . 
  the study estimated that germany would need to add about 400,000 skilled immigrants to its workforce every year to maintain its economic strength . 
  source : [ forbidden in this thread ] ( www.google.com ) 2 . 
  thus merkel invited people ( 3 years later ) . 
   we can do it . 
  that 's the message chancellor angela merkel has been giving her country ever since she pledged in late august to provide refuge to anyone coming from syria it 's not enyone coming from syria - and the article did not mention that it was decision of her and the prime ministerm of austria - fainman to get rid of border checking . 
  source : http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/refugee-policy-of-chancellor-merkel-divides-europe-a-1053603.html 3 . 
  now they want to send the ones that has no education to our part of eu . 
  should i check sources or do you know about it ? 
  my post for you was deleted by auto-censor from this sub . 
  i will try to response after finding sources that are acepted here . 
  imho it 's not working like that :  one can play the game `` let 's all be sovereign '' , but in reality one has then to follow a bigger state and obey multiniational firms . 
  germany is not a white plush maskot that would like hug everybody . 
  they have their own priorities - such as making nordstrim 1 and 2 . 
  one can be wonder - why - if there is an eu and they can put pipes , which is less cost , across ee countries . 
  their industry needs more people . 
  thus merkel invited people . 
  now they want to send the ones that has no education to our part of eu . 
  i do n't like it . 
  and thus i do n't like the ` federalization ' idea from germany . 
  for me it 's just an 1-st attempt in xxi century , when germany wants to be a hegemon in eu . 
  you can find a number of different criteria by which you can divide the eu countries . 
  it can be a common currency or opt-out and other ones . 
  junker once said about that . 
  after the brexit the only eu hegemon is germany . 
  they seek to federalize ( ie reduce the importance of national parliaments for the common ( ie germany ) europe . ), 
  according to me - they do not want to preserve what is now , they want to reduce the role of national states . 
  question - do we agree with that or not ? 
  and what could be the consistency of the ` yes or no ' decision for our countries . 
  the only criterion that comes to my mind - is the common currency ? 
  do you talk about it ? 
  in case of poland :  probalby from ` tli\u0107 ' ( to smoulder ) . 
  for sure from that - from [ wiki ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/tlen#historia ) :  jan oczapowski proposed the name `` tlen '' ( from the word `` tli\u0107 '' - ` to smoulder ' ) before 1851 and was accepted by most of the polish chemical community in about 10 years . 
  the earlier polish name `` kwasor\u00f3d '' was a literal latin translation and was introduced by j\u0119drzej \u015aniadecki [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . 
  as far as i know the negotiations about final text is not finished . 
  i hope we will find a consensus and declaration of our pm is just a part of negotiations . 
  but imho divide eu in ` richer ' and ` poorer ' parts is not a good idea - on the level of writing it in official documents declaring the future of eu , and this is the point that is hard to be accepted by poland ( and some other of the countries of eu ) . 
   however bashing the eu for them is ridiculous given the enormous cash they received . 
  not agreeing for everything is hard to name ` bashing ' imho . 
  hope particular countries can have their own voices . 
  and as i said poland is not different from other countries in criterion of taking per-capita subsidy . 
  and for sure poland is not the biggest one . 
   is there a country that has benefited more from the eu than poland ? 
  as an total amount of subsidy - of course - poland is in eu from 2004 . 
  and in per-capita criterion there is a lot of countries that take more money than poland even today . 
   how comfortable would people in the eu be with having a transgender/transsexual leader ? 
  is it a really a criterion to choose a leader ? 
  hope not . 
  i hope we will have a society in the future , that everybody - even ones being on the lowest level of our current societies such as for today being gays , transgenders , having down syndrome , transexuals - our societies will not use accusation and curse words of being ` fag ' , ` tranny ' or ` transexual ' , ` down ' . 
  just hope so . 
  here you have an todays [ article ] ( http://e-chelmno.pl/happening-z-okazji-swiatowego-dnia-zespolu-downa-i-powitania-wiosny ) from my town in poland - the celebration of the first eastern day and the day of people with the down syndrome . 
  in poland now is a big discussion on the side of ` smart one ' , ` european supporters ' , ` the only ones that know the truth ' , ` moral authorities ' , ` young educated living in big cities ' , etc - if kaczynski - the pis leader - is a gay and why he do n't have a wife , or if our current ministry of national defence is passive gay or rather not - just active one that likes young boys - and the same level of shit . 
  the same accusation of being homo , trans , or not fit to the current society were used many times in our history . 
  i 'm ashamed of that . 
  have you got the same in your countries ? 
  and i 'm not asking about support for ` modern topic ' like for example gay-marriages . 
  just for everyday support for differences . 
  and not using differences as an accusations and as a factor for discusion . 
  done . 
  imho one can easily explain this - [ percentage of antidepressant users ] ( http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/207/3/221/f2.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1 ) that report taking them regularly by country , with 95 % confidence intervals .

  it was a joke man - i should give an / s. 
  it could be opened and waited for reading . 
  it was funny - you could left it . 
   they claim alexander the great , but everyone knows he was from the great empire of macedonia . 
  do not murder me it 's a joke is n't his heritage disputed even until today ? 
  edit : ** / s **, 
  and in 7349 bc they split to the estonians , hungarians and finns . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_romani_people ) you have the list of famous romani people . 
  for example chaplin . 
  i heard that [ elvis presley had also romani roots ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=presley+elvis+gypsy&amp;oq=presley+elvis+gypsy ) - but he is not on the list . 
  poland is one of only [ five nato members ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/08/news/nato-summit-spending-countries ) that meets the alliance 's guideline for defense spending . 
  and i hope you are right . 
   how about we deport some poles if you hate immigration so much ? 
  who told you that we hate immigration ?
