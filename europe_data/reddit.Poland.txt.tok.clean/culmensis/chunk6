  it is a synonym . 
  it is changing now . 
  my company is cooperating with romanian it company - and it is really great . 
  taken from [ here ] ( http://blogs.transparent.com/polish/polish-sayings-powiedzenia ) `` potrzebny jak dziura w mo\u015bcie '' = `` as necessary as a hole in the bridge '' ( when someone or something is not necessary ) . 
  `` jak ci\u0119 widz\u0105 , tak ci\u0119 pisz\u0105 '' = `` how they see you , that 's how they perceive you '' `` lepszy wr\u00f3bel w gar\u015bci ni\u017c go\u0142\u0105b na dachu '' = `` it 's better to have a sparrow in your hand , than a pigeon on the roof '' `` co nagle , to po diable '' = `` the devil dictates when you 're in a hurry '' `` sukces ma wieju ojc\u00f3w , pora\u017cka jest sierot\u0105 '' = `` a success has many fathers , a failure is an orphan '' `` kto pije i pali ten nie ma robali '' = `` the one who both smokes and drinks does n't get roundworms '' miejsce gdzie `` psy dupami szczekaj\u0105 '' = the place where `` dogs are barking by arses '' ( very rural place ) . 
   [ opportunity makes thieves ] ` okazja czyni z\u0142odzieja ' - literally the same . 
  from the other hand , when you count numbers it goes like in the example above from / u/fw190 : 1 tysi\u0105c ( one thousand ) 2 , 3 , 4 tysi\u0105ce 5,6 , ... tysi\u0119cy ( execpt of number  4 modulo 10 = = 2,3,4 =  tysi\u0105ce ), 
  for the next lesson , we 'll talk about the number : three . 
   and yes , it was ad personam that is great - we have one point that we can agree . 
  have a good night . 
   let 's burn him at the stake so 16year-olds it is just argumentum ad personam . 
  you might as well say that i 'm too old or too young to participate in the discussion . 
  it is not wise . 
  what is the best age for you ? 
  in order to raise the level of disscusion , please use only the substantial arguments in the future . 
  correct . 
  but it was old good times when whores were called whores , thieves were called thieves , collaborators was called collaborators and v-th column was called v-th column . 
  nowadays it is more relativistic . 
  digest : this article is about that polish government is paying 60 mln euro annually for european space agency . 
  despite of this poland has minimal participation in programs . 
  the cure is appointment of polish space agency by polish parliament . 
  i do not know if it is the best idea . 
  for sure it will create a good jobs for some people . 
  i do not want to justify any physical violence . 
  so none should do that . 
  but before falling of ussr there was in poland clear division : we - polish people and they - collaborators and communists . 
  after falling off ussr in poland was no judicial inquiry who was collaborator and who should not take any political or social activities ( such us in czech or eastern germany ) . 
  some of such people in modern poland are taking high positions without accountability for its past . 
   is to found some foreigners ' critique or say ` they are ashaming us in the eyes of europe ' often they are local journalists publishing in foreign newspapers . 
  it 's just biased opinion told by one of the controversial ` young ' extremist fighters - now in his middle-age . 
  it is hard to say how will look the job market in the several tens of years . 
  for now one of the most wanted job is programist with particular skills ( let 's say it 's java and mobile devices programming ) . 
  20-30 years ago in this area it was for example sco , cobol , ibm mainframes , dos etc. 
  nowadays it is hard to find a job with this skills . 
  it is changing rapidly and you will have to learn every new technology and compete with the increasingly younger vintages . 
  i would look for job that is licensed and has limited quantity . 
  such jobs are eg judges , lawyers , prosecutors , etc. 
  but in poland , these occupations are associated with nepotism , so it will probably be hard to get it without a proper family . 
  similar profession is a profession like a doctor . 
  in this case , however , you do not need ` protection ' to get his medical degree . 
  if i would have possibility to choose once again - i 'd choose the medicine . 
  if you will be in the eu . 
  hard to believe . 
  according to data for 2012 from eurostat ` share of total population not having indor flushing toilet for the sole use for their household ' poland has 3.8 % of such ones . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/okjhkxb ) is the map for eu . 
  as always it is associated with the borders of the partitions of poland . 
  imho most poles like russians as separate people . 
  but not like your government and state . 
  must be so high if they have such [ depression ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/depression_ ( geology \\ ) ) and want to see well at long distances . 
  unbuckle your [ badge ] ( https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/magazines/new-era/2013/07/ne13jul19-000-tag-youre-it-mormonad-poster.jpg ) . 
  must they have a cash register and issue receipts ? 
  or their taxes depends on the oral statements to tax authority ? 
  what does it mean that prostitution is regulated ? 
  does it mean that prostitution is treated as a ` real ' job and have all of this stuff like taxes , minimum wages , vacation , no discrimination based on age , appearance and sex ? 
  and can labor offices direct unemployed people to work as prostitutes ? 
   when people talk about anti-semitism they mostly mean stuff like diminishing the responsibility that hungary had in ww2 . 
  do you have also in hungary people of jewish origin , that changed their names to localized , ` real hungarian ' ones ? 
  are they also ` moral authorities ' who talk and write about the trespasses of hungarian people ? 
  also the spell `` anti-semitism '' spirt is used as a weapon to blackmail and denigrate people who disagree with them ? 
  can you talk openly about comunist traitors of jewish origin that ruled your country after the end of wwii ? 
  is this also considered as anti-semitism ? 
  if so - you are not alone . 
  please tell that story . 
  what do you say when you strike with a hammer ? 
  to whom you support when there would be a match us-pl ? 
   we 've never annexed anyone , maybe [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak_invasion_of_poland_ ( 1939 \\ ) ) will help you feel better . 
  for me it is the same . 
  i think so . 
  in case of poland there was 3 millions ethnic poles and 3 millions jews . 
  both group was polish citizens . 
  what does ` solna ' mean in swedish ? 
  in polish it means adjective from salt - just like in ` salt grotto ' ( ` solna grota ' ) . 
  / u/ajuc is probably referring to the rumor that pi\u0142sudski proposed to france a preventive war against germany , after adolf hitler came to power in january 1933 . 
  it has been argued that pi\u0142sudski may have been sounding out france regarding possible joint military action against germany . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_pi%c5%82sudski  due to the influx of jews from the polish territory that was annexed . 
  never heard about it . 
  after annexing part of poland , germans forced jews to live in gettos . 
   a couple 12 % beers 12 % is a percentage of extract - it is not amount of alcohol . 
  usually beer has 5 % of alcohol . 
  here you have polish one : https://translate.google.pl/#pl/en/r%2c%20r%2c%20r%2c%20r%2c%20r%2c%20r%2c%20r just press the speaker button on the left panel . 
  then you can change the language for many other languages . 
  the most interesting one imho is thai ( nsfw  . 
  it was a joke ... from the other hand it seems that from the time you became a brit , poles began to annoy you . 
  i like it . 
  how could we arrange this ? 
   while the polish government is defending their national interests , the romanian government is trying to convince the people what a great thing it would be if we would let foreigners extract our shale gas and our gold trough questionable methods . 
  not quite true . 
  most of the concessions was given to international companies : 3legs resources , talisman energy , marathon oil , chevron , san leon energy , bnk petroluem inc. , eni , exxonmobil corporation , hutton energy/baasgas , dpv service . 
  here you have a map with the concessions : http://www.polskielupki.pl/index.php/gaz-lupkowy-w-polsce/koncesje in this case the issue is in the russian origins of this company . 
  there are more important things than money . 
   numerus clausus for me this idea is similar to gender parity law , which now is considered as good . 
   operation priboi resulted in ~ 90,000 estonians , latvians and lithuanians being sent to siberia . 
  katyn massacre ended the lives of 22,000 educated poles . 
  ftfy : [ in 1940 and the first half of 1941 , the soviets deported a total of more than 1,200,000 poles in four waves of mass deportations from the soviet-occupied polish territories . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_ ( 1939 % e2 % 80 % 9346 \\ ) #mass _ deportations_to_the_east ), 
  once we had common country . 
  next step to society described by orwell . 
  and [ detroit ] ( http://imgur.com/a/s3dwa ) today . 
   we are talking about pre-ww2 situation me too .
