  you can deport anyone that you like - it 's your country - anywhere you are from . 
   i 've always wondered why it 's so hard to hold a flag or say i love [ blank ] . 
  why do europeans view this act as so vile ? 
  not [ everywhere ] ( https://youtu.be/4ykqvo4t1p0 ) . 
  all of you - europeans are welcomed to our ` march of independency ' at 11 of november in poland . 
   his less than reliable commitment to nato for example . 
  agree - it could be dangerous for our current status quo . 
  less for germany - you have your eastern cordon , but more for us . 
   i would like to see more working toghether as one world you know that it 's just an utopia , truism and empty slogan that everybody , everyone , every movement , every party would agree with it . 
  do you know anyone that would not agree with that ? 
  do you think merkel does n't agree ? 
  or trump does n't agree with that ? 
  or kim ir sen does n't ? 
  i agree with you - i would like to see more working toghether as one world . 
  but back to the question - germany needs more cheap workers . 
  merkel decision to open borders were based on that . 
  now they want to send people that do n't fit their standards to other countries in eu . 
  they [ blackmail ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/commission-wants-to-make-eu-countries-pay-for-not-accepting-refugees/ ) other countries to take them . 
  does trump do the same ? 
   and trumps decisions dont ? . 
  which ones - for our part of the world ? 
   how she runs her country is their business , just like trump can make the us a laughing stock if that 's what americans want . 
  consequences of her decisions affect other countries too , unfortunately . 
  because the bus stops in the middle of the queue . 
  the bus waits t seconds at the stop . 
  the average finn runs at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour . 
  calculate function that indicates the maximum distance between the finns ( n - number of finns , t - time in seconds the bus wait ) , so that all of them could get to the bus . 
  it depends what a woman like . 
  and what can we do for you ? 
  what is the marvelous society that would fit you ? 
   so would you say that this bill is a positive change ? 
  seriously - i do n't know . 
  i can see arguments of both sides . 
  the law should not be created as a solution for particular issues , but the fact is that there are loud , aggressive masses that do n't like current government and would do everything to impeach them . 
  i do n't like such a behaviour . 
  and idea of separating opponents by 100m is not a stupid solution imho . 
  and you ? 
  what do you think ? 
   free media just googled and found that germany is the only western democracy with de facto cenzorship organization like [ federal department for media harmful to yound persons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_department_for_media_harmful_to_young_persons ) . 
  from wiki :  the bpjm has drawn criticism for de facto censorship , paternalism , and restricting the freedom of speech and of the press on the following grounds :  1 . 
  after a work has been indexed , in practice it also becomes more difficult for adults to get access to it , as indexed works must not be advertised and may be sold by mail order only under strict conditions . 
  the sale of such works is therefore often not profitable , and the work thus disappears from the market . 
  journalists may carry out self-censorship and choose not to mention the work to avoid possible legal trouble . 
  germany is the only western democracy with an organization like the bpjm . 
  the rationales for earlier decisions to add works to the index are , in retrospect , incomprehensible reactions to moral panics . 
  an example of this is the controversy about the computer game river raid . 
  i realy like the idea of free media and i think we can do much more to improve situation in our countries . 
  edit : [ bonus ] ( http://p5.focus.de/img/incoming/origs417537/0685377207-w300-h168-o-q75-p5/dig-youtube-video-blockiert.jpg ) . 
  the issue is caused imho because some of poles want to celebrate the death of polish president . 
  this manifestations are made periodically - once a month . 
  some of poles want to disturb it and making manifestation at the same place and at the same time : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl25ibh41ru . 
  in mid-december last year , parliament passed an amendment to the law on assemblies by pis , which regulates the rules of manifestations . 
  it assumes , among others , that the distance between the assemblies can not be less than 100 meters . 
  it also provides the opportunity to receive a three-year agreement of the authorities to organize regular meetings and lack of organization a competitive gathering at the same place and time . 
   its not `` leeching '' , the eus plan is to kickstart the polish economy by heavily investing money . 
  its a experiment . 
  to see if you could bring a country to the same level as the other western european states by giving them a lot of cash . 
  i 'm not sure if we are talking about the same chart - poland is not distinguished from other countries from our part of eu and some of countries of ` old europe ' like for example portugal . 
  for me - if it is an experiment - then it is not only about particularly poland . 
   its economy doubled in just the 4 years between 2004 and 2008 !, 
  and its economy is growing ever since they joined the eu . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/uogzd ) you have the polish pkb per capita chart . 
  please point the date of accessing the eu . 
  source of this chart : http://pl.tradingeconomics.com/poland/gdp-per-capita, 
  sorry if i was not being precise . 
  of course i do n't agree with the thesis that 160,000-250 ,000 escaped from ghettos and 80-90 % were killed by poles . 
  i do n't agree with the methodology - which relay on the assumption that 10 % escaped . 
  why not 5 % or 20 % ? 
  there is no reliable sources on that . 
  please read the article i linked above ( it 's in polish , but i hope google translate will works well ) . 
  the author is quite controversial and is not taken seriously for most of poles . 
   she said estimates range between 160,000-250 ,000 jews who escaped and sought help from fellow poles . 
  she said only about 10-20 percent of those survived , with the rest rejected , informed upon or killed by the rural poles themselves . 
  it 's so unfair imho . 
  the number of jews killed by poles are estimated . 
  the number varies depending on author . 
  for example krzysztof persak estimated that 10 % jews escaped from ghettos ( for reinhard action area it was 1.6 million of jews - thus 160.000 , according to him , escaped ) and 30 - 40 thousand survived . 
  conclusion ? 
  the rest - 120.000 was killed - mostly by poles . 
  despite of strange assumptions of 10 % the conclusions are imho delusional , wrong and unfair . 
   are they known in poland or do you have your own versions of the song ? 
  i do n't know anything about a song , but there was a [ novel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_promised_land_ ( novel \\ ) ) by nobel laureate , w\u0142adys\u0142aw reymont about the lodz . 
  there is also a movie about his novel . 
  not bad - you should see it . 
  looking at some of the 1-st speed european countries ... all i can say :  `` give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
  send these , the homeless , tempest-tost to me , i lift my lamp beside the golden door ! '', 
   the whole thing started because of mistranslation . 
  imho even with a big portion of good will it 's hard to say that it 's just an ` mistranslation ' . 
  the author used subtitle : ` if i win , i will take the cooperation of kaczynski in the dismantling of the union - says `` rzeczpospolita '' national front leader marine le pen . ', 
  a day later , the author of the article [ apologized for using the word ` dismantle ' ] ( http://www.rp.pl/polityka/170319565-wyjasnienie-autora-w-sprawie-tekstu-le-pen-chce-sojuszu-z-pis.html ) and found that this was not mentioned during the conference . 
  imho such a respected institution like bloomberg should check the source and do not use clikbait titles . 
  the whole mess started in the press conference of marie le pen . 
  on the question of `` rzeczpospolita '' , whether orban and kaczynski could be allies of le pen in the construction of the new europe , the leader of the national front says : `` in any case , many topics i think . 
  if tomorrow i become the president of the french republic , i think i can make a debate with mr. orban about what seems unacceptable , intolerable in the manner in which the european union operates today . 
  the same applies to mr. kaczynski . 
  we will certainly not agree in everything . 
  but once again this is the freedom and sovereignty of nations to defend their own interests . 
  they can be shared at some point , they may be common in some areas , they may also be different . 
  this is the foundation of international politics . '',
