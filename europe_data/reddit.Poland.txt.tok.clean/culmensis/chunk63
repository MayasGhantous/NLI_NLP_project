  only from poland it was [ 1800000 ] ( http://www.rp.pl/artykul/365363-1-8-mln-polskich-ofiar-stalina.html ) victims of stalinism . 
   no offense , but your english hurts my eyes , so you are not the best person to accuse someone else of being too dumb . 
  no problem - you just reject our common level of understanding . 
  it 's your choice . 
  but out of curiosity ? 
  - what errors in the above message ? 
   so , you are arguing that `` national socialism '' as coined by the national socialist parties so far is not bad ? 
  quite opposite - every socialism -- despite of description such as ` national ' , ` modern ' , ` average ' , ` smart ' , ` justice ' is just a socialism . 
  and it 's bad and murderous . 
   ... the obvious being that the financial times are clearly communists ? 
  bad conclusions . 
  i was talking about this particular article concidering former communist comerade . 
   ukraine , romania , bulgary , greece , italy , spain , portugal , france , switzerland , austria , hungary , slovakia , czechia , poland and finally germany . 
  do you have any information on what material the pipe that lies on baltic see is made ( so called - nordstream ) ? 
  how much is it durable ? 
  thank you . 
  thank you . 
  let 's see  1 . 
  ` flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays . ', 
  sorry man - [ but it 's just funny ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=merkel+european+flags&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewim1e-_sbrsahwfliwkhqyfaioq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=676 ) . 
  ` because of fear of enemies and the need for security , the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of `` need . '' ', 
  it 's not fun but you can find maps showing the places in germany where ` refugees ' makes a [ crime ] ( http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/cologne-is-every-day-europes-rape-epidemic/news-story/e2e618e17ad4400b5ed65045e65e141d ) and you - germans are not informd about it . 
  not mentioning the message from youtube that a footage are not available for germans . 
  should i see the 3-rd point ? 
  let 's see ? 
  scapegoats as a unifying cause - for me it 's obvious that it 's uk , trump and new polish government that not fit . 
  for me it 's enaugh . 
  you are obviously nazi  edit :  http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm, 
  some kind of amerikanisation of german society do n't you think ? 
  with on the one hand - ` from rags to riches ' slogan and on the other - all the byzantine astonish and affirmation by scientific titles . 
  do n't you think herr doctorr thaddel ? 
  give a definition of a nazi please . 
  compare it with other leftist movement from xx century history like communism . 
  try to avoid declarative slogans and compare facts and effects . 
  as the conclusion please write what is the difference between leftists movement in xx century in criterion of fatalities . 
   you do n't simply disagree , you call everything that truthfully supports him communism - which is usual nazis tactics , seriously . 
  do n't you think that the same rethoric can be used for every argument ? 
  so - should we not discusse the communist because they were attacked by nazis and it was bad ? 
  really ? 
   ... what will you take as a compliment ? 
  being the first one who noticed the obvious . 
  i will be invited to different breakfast tv 's and then - drums , and then i go out dressed all in white , 
   lmao , dude . 
  you forgot the `` national '' part of the nationalsozialismus would you like to narrow the ` right-wing ' definition only to the ` national ' part ? 
  in the criterion that separate nations cares about their own businesses ? 
  and it 's bad ? 
  if so - do you think that modern germany government cares about their own nation ? 
  or not ? 
  is modern germany government nationalistic or not ? 
   actually , no i ca n't . 
  i can remember how in november 89 czechoslovak television made no mention of hundreds of thousands people protesting all over the country . 
  89 - it was the final stage of the process . 
  the most interesting was before . 
  and believe me - it was the same level of propaganda from obligatory ussr newspapers in our school like : murzilka , kraj rad etc. 
  - tovarisch andropov make this , make that , kiss childern , the tailor from factory had a gooseflesh when she saw the andropov etc. 
  -- the same level of propaganda as today . 
  we as a kids were laughing at that . 
  unfortunately todays articles and articles before - like imho in the der st\u00fcrmer - nothing is changing imho . 
   a bit resistant to right wing populism , they should not be . 
  hitler and stalin were the socialists party leaders at that time . 
  really is that simple recipe : not agree with schultz - than you are a nazi supporter ? 
  seriously ? 
  is it working like it for you ? 
  please put attention that i 'm not talking about particular newspaper but only about this article . 
  if you have any further questions - please feel free to ask . 
   personal experiences how it is ` easy ' in slovak ? 
  in polish it 's ` spokojnie ' . 
  i do n't want to be rude . 
  of course we are not editors of these newspapers - it 's rather a rethorical question . 
  but i can remember the same level of propaganda like fot todays ft - do n't you think so ? 
   gottwaldov was on czech side of the border , tho . 
  i know . 
  during that time you were the unite , single country = so i use the ` your country ' expression . 
  are you old enough to remember that times ? 
  can we talk on the level of personal experiences ? 
   why should his school education still matter ? 
  so - what matter ? 
  for them - politicians from 68 movement - a bunch of friend you can find many of criterions that approve them to take the job . 
  what particular skills are important for you ? 
  knowledge of a few langauages ? 
  ukrainians working in poland knows at least 3 - polish , russian and ukrainian . 
  should they be a presidents of a country because of that ? 
  we run far away from the primary article - ~ ~ glad ~ ~ hope you agree that it was just a propagandist article . 
  merkel has a some kind of phd even if it 's from communist times , but schulz ? 
  you germans are always described as hard working , watching for education , emanating of your titles etc. 
  it 's a stereotype of course . 
  but that old drunkard fart without even hochschulreife - just why ? 
  is n't it a degradation for you as a country ? 
  thank you man - i worked in your country in the beautiful gottwaldov town when i was a teenager . 
  at that time it was popullar to shift young people to work . 
  like todays erasmus . 
  i bought a jolana electric guitar for my earning . 
  good times . 
  shit food but good times , 
   what about the last two paragraphes ? 
  yes - the last two paragraphs make the whole article reliable  / sss / ^ s. 
  but seriously - man - people like schulz or kohn-bandit as any kind of authorities ? 
  seriously ? 
  i will take it as a compliment , 
   what do you mean by `` beautiful propaganda congratulatory scroll for tovarisch or commerade schulz '' ?
