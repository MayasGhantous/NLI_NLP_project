   hell it is much better now than during the 90s when it comes to gangs . 
  what kind of gangs had you got in 90s ? 
   that some gang leader or similar some groups seem to be a real power in your country . 
  sorry for that . 
  it seems that the statement of trump is a blessing for the current government of sweden . 
  they have a scapegoat to blame for their own shortcomings . 
   two brothers , where tatra mountains made barrier , so they could n't fight each other on the other hand - ' ** even such a high mountains like carpathians ca n't divide polish - hungarian friendship ** ' ( tm ) . 
  seriously - in history we had many times common borders - last time [ in 1939 ] ( http://imgfrm.index.hu/imgfrm/7/0/0/1/big_0008367001.jpg ) . 
  i have the impression of deja vu in this case too . 
  which can be translated to :  i believe that it does not matter who and how will vote in the party ; but what is crucial is who and how will count votes . 
  on the other hand - i accept them even if they are not honest . 
  what i affraid is the big shift of people ruling our world . 
  imho it will not be a good movement for poland particulary . 
   this is like the brotherhood of the problem kids . 
  somebody here is a little bit jealous ... . 
  obligatory ^ ^ / s part from poland : ` w\u0119gier polak dwa bratanki i do szabli i do szklanki ' ( ` pole and hungarian cousins be ' ) . 
  ` illegal antenna ' sounds funny now  . 
  i remember that listening to ` radio free europe ' was forbidden and one could be punished for doing that . 
  substitute of that feeling can experience modern people from some countries seeing the ` this video is unavailable in your country ' message in youtube website and trying to use an vpn  . 
   and its architecture served as a model for the whole baltic sea area , from stockholm to tallinn , riga , etc. 
  some of modern cities in my part of poland were located on a german law . 
  including my own town : [ che\u0142mno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/che%c5%82mno ) - ( [ kulm ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/che%c5%82mno_\\ ( weichsel \\ ) ) ) , but only few of them ( elbl\u0105g , tczew , frombork , chojnice , braniewo and hel ) were located on lubeck law . 
  most of them were located on the magdeburg law . 
  greetings from hanseatic city . 
  the name of l\u00fcbeck comes from the word ` lubov ' which means ` love ' or ` to like ' - nice one imho . 
  and unofficially ? 
  it 's not a secret that we call you pepiki . 
  russians and ukrainians call us psheki - because of rustling sounds in polish language - which i find rather funny - but in theirs languages it 's derogatory term . 
   why is that ? 
   to buy a home in germany decided five years ago marta ( 34 ) and christopher ( 41 ) szuster from gryfino . 
  they bought a house in the village bordering staffelde just 3 km from poland . 
  `` the 110-meter renovated house ready to live together with the plot we spent only 54.000 euro or 226.000 z\u0142otys - `` says ms. marta . 
  '' - for a similar house in poland would have to pay about a million zlotys '' she adds . 
  greece and portugal according to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5sfc9z/total_eu_spend_and_total_eu_contribution_in_euro/ddenhla ) . 
  there are also luxemburg and belgium - but they got it for eu institutions imho . 
  sry for personal question - but can you vote ? 
   how does it contradict what he said ? 
  here we discuss the factors that led poland did not fall into recession , unlike other eu countries . 
  it is therefore important in my opinion to present the discussed criteria in the appropriate context . 
  poland is quite big country and for it companies the local market is efficient . 
  companies from smaller countries are/were focused on international markets at start imho . 
  according to the [ poll from november of 2016 ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/sondaz-cbos-polacy-popieraja-czlonkostwo-polski-w-ue/b9d97z ) 84 % of poles support eu - and this raised in a few last years . 
  so this factor did not work . 
  as far as i remember it 's the highest score in countries of eu . 
  please do n't make conclusions from youtube popularity and demonstrations . 
   i ca n't believe that the negativity towards eu is raising in poland . 
  so idiotic . 
  is it ? 
  have you got any sources ? 
   we also got quite a bit of eu money then . 
  and now too , 
   poland has benefited tremendously from eu membership . 
  there are countries in eu - even from ` old ' eu - that benefited more than poland in the criterion of per capita . 
  is this a direct link to the nazi ss symbol or croatian army has different explanation for that ? 
   poland is an economic experiment from the eu to see if pumping really big amounts of money makes them catch up faster , so that helps too your neighbour - portugal for example , takes more eu money per capita than poland . 
  would you call them ` experiment ' ? 
   was really her who was driving or was kaczynski ? 
  good question - thank you for a rational voice from abroad . 
   there is no such law , the article only says that the bavarian minister says something stupid . 
  why would i not trust merkel 's authority because people tell lies about her ? 
  i 'm not a lawyer - but her decisions were controversial not only according to bavarian minister . 
  first few links from google for searching : ` germany drops eu rules ' : 1 .

  so - again - which part of my message is not even true ? 
  imho it is not important what particular people thinks about her . 
  the most important question is - if she broke the law or not . 
  i 'm not a lawyer but imho it depends on interpretation . 
  her activities in the criterion of obeying the law can be assessed as controversial imho . 
  there are different oppinions even in germany . 
  therefore weird in my opinion is that she teaches others how to respect the law . 
  and what is more strange - for some she is an authority in the field of obeying the law . 
   that is not even true . 
  which part of my message is not even true ? 
   great job by merkel , we need liberal leaders that stands up for democracy and rule of law . 
  [ merkel 's refugee policy breaks the law , bavarian minister says ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-28/merkel-s-refugee-policy-breaks-the-law-bavarian-minister-says ) :  german chancellor angela merkel 's decision not to apply european union rules in her handling of the region 's refugee crisis violates german laws , said a bavarian state minister whose party is allied with merkel nationally . 
  i like merkel personally , but i 'm not sure if you have chosen your authority on obeying the law correctly ... 
  unfortunately the text is behind a paywall . 
   poland got more money than any other eu country thrown at it , yet they 're supposedly the most anti-eu because of it ? 
   i 'm starting to think we 're all better off without poland . 
  not in per capita criterion . 
  portugal fyi takes more . 
  poland is not most anti-eu - where did you get this ? 
  i did not say this . 
  thank you for your contribution - but it was the rethorical answer , 
  europe led by germany lost uk not so far ago . 
  hope this time germans will have a good idea to keep all the remaining countries together . 
  imho - the main factor of keeping alive the eu is the question - whether it is profitable to the germans ? 
  on the first day , when the indicators will deny it - the germans will liquidate the eu and all the euro area imho . 
   why is islamophobia on the rise in europe ? 
  is n't it yet once more a typical thesis statement ? 
  i saw many beautiful girls - let 's say ` meat ' as you want - and the reasons i found - that they do n't liked me was that i was to ugly , dull etc. 
  the reason was on my side . 
  i never thought that the reason is on her side - because of her believes - such as catholicism . 
   just teasing prepare some lubricants . 
  and start your imagination trip ... 
   i studied together with a croatian girl she filled every stereotype .
