  the manifestations are really impresive . 
   can you hear me budapest ? 
  can you hear me warsaw ? 
  can you hear me moscow ? 
  can you hear me istanbul ? 
  can you hear me paris ? 
  can you hear me london ? 
  but this did not occure in our countries . 
  we do n't have to protest against such a law . 
  what is the aim and goal of such a call ? 
  do you really like making fun of names ? 
  really ? 
  is it your level ? 
   all sort of stolen stuff from germany ends up there all of the stuff [ stolen from poland by germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_looting_of_poland ) ? 
  everywhere antennas . 
  like [ here ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qyd_pitgxvm/sp2s1_ecjui/aaaaaaaadpy/tdd7mz-ansu/s1600/satellite_dishes_fever__17.jpg ) . 
   8 million jews why 8 ? 
  8 is not divided by 6 . 
   since our societies are so similar . 
  can you name and list some of the similarities between you and us , that are most important from your , lithuanian pov , without truisms and obviousness influences from current political issues ? 
   but i think it is safe to say most people think of thank you for understanding . 
  i think that it is easy to not appreciate the [ crowd psychology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crowd_psychology ) . 
  imho we should just call the white as white and black as black . 
  that 's all . 
   but muh polish death camps exactly . 
  you can imagine that the anne frank house will become a temple . 
  and because of this , her house will be called - dutch place of horror of anne frank . 
  times flow unfortunately - less and less people remember about it - what was the reason etc. 
  for sure we imho got nothing from sikorski 's decision . 
  the youngest will know nothing about it . 
  older ones will be ashamed . 
  ` older ' in the meaning of the 2008 ... -- it 's just sad . 
  it was in 2008 . 
  i remember i was really ashamed that our minister of foreign affairs - sikorski did that . 
  he recognited of kosovo as independend state . 
  it was no our confilct . 
  i remember that i was trying to find some of the serbian online newspapers and send some messages -- that ( i remember - it sounds a little bit pathetic - but it was like that ) : this is not our government . 
  we do n't support it . 
  we are sorry fot his decision . 
  and - once again - sorry serbians . 
  few years later all the russians used this kosovo movement as an excuse to crimea occupation . 
   because i 'm not sure anyone in poland even knows the issues around kosovo . 
  depends on your interests and set of your friends . 
  i 'm glad that you are not talking in the name of all poles . 
   - the place of holocaust imho it 's just a one of the biggest lie . 
  i 'm old enough to remember memories , documentaries , evidences that holocaust ( if we even try to narrow this horror and victims of german-nazis ideology only to jew victims and forget about poles , russian pow 's , belarusians , ukrainians etc. ), 
  happened in all of the european countries conquered by germans . 
  begining from germany - in places like shtutoff , dachau , buchenwald etc. 
  by northern territories of europe like klooga , and the east like maly trostenets , sobibor and probably many more . 
  as a child i was in schtutthof . 
  now in poland - but during wwii - it was pure germany place . 
  we have been there to see the horror of wwii from school trip . 
  there were gass chambers that we can see , there were zykoln-b cans in a glass-cases , there were german uniforms , shoes of victims , briefcases , baracks and all the stuff that one can see in the now ` real extermination-camps ' . 
  there were description how zyklon-b was applied to gass chambers , who did it etc. 
  why all of these extermination camps like shtutthoff , dachau , buchenwald etc. 
  , are now not cosidered as ` extermination-camps ' ? 
  why only few of them are left and are considered as ` real ' one and the other now are not ? 
  what was the criterion to not consider them as such a one ? 
  the serhuesped version is imho more like the b ** y ** d -  s ** e ** r and ** guest ** -  ** huesp ** ed . 
   bydgoszcz it 's because of the way it is written imho . 
  one of the legend about origin of the name is ` be ( my ) guest ' - so it 's beguest in modern english if it helps . 
  ` be ' and ` guest ' has roots in proto-indo-european language so they are probably common in most eruopean countries - you can translate it for your langage . 
  for modern polish it would be b\u0105d\u017ago\u015b\u0107 - i like the original version more  it would be great if you could provide version for your country of this name . 
  let me start : 1 . 
  english : beguest . 
   i have feelings , that poland , this days , have normal to good relationships with their neighbors . 
  that is true . 
  it 's true for whole eu imho . 
  i wish it will be like that for a long time . 
  we are living in a good times ( sorry ukraine - i hope you will have a peace very soon ) . 
   they dont like us much for some reason why do you think so ? 
  if i remember polls , you are one of the more if not the most liked neighbour . 
  are there any protestants for this decision ? 
  so - we should not remember , analize and draw conclusions from the facts that took place before we were born ? 
  hope it 's not your point . 
   it was a very `` dickish '' move that resulted agree . 
  poles apologised for this many times . 
  but it is taken frequently last time by czechs . 
  please pay attention for this - [ root ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qfzu8/european_history_20170127/dczxcy7/ ) of this thread :  98 years ago , we had a. . . dispute ... with our neighbours i just wanted to draw a historical context for czechs ' casual accusations and your butthurts vs poland . 
  please pay attention that such an accusations were not existent few years or even months ago . 
  imho something is in the air . 
  seriously - federalize or leave ? 
  maybe some kind of discussion first ? 
   actually , germany in the refugee crisis obeyed the law . 
  as you might see when you look at a map , germany does n't have an outer eu border . 
  if you want to point fingers for violations of laws and treaties , you 'll have to find someone else . 
  ,  late on 4 september 2015 , chancellor werner faymann of austria , in conjunction with chancellor angela merkel of germany , announced that migrants would be allowed to cross the border from hungary into austria and onward to germany , and early on 5 september 2015 , buses with migrants began crossing the austro-hungarian border . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis#cite_note-allowedtocross1-134 ) . 
   and again , germany is n't forcing other countries to do `` the same '' . 
  see answer above . 
   `` there will have to be a fairer distribution of refugees , with more solidarity , '' government spokesman steffen seibert told a news conference . 
  [ source ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/germany-seeks-solidarity-refugee-crisis-332256?rm=eu ) and i 'm sure there were some threats about paying anormous ammount of money for every ` refugges ' that was not accepted by ee countries . 
  your questions are not important . 
  what is important - who will win next elections in eu countries . 
  how many countries will agree to build common eu even in current shape - even without forced feredalization - how many of them will escape such as uk ? 
  france , nederlands ? 
  who will be next ? 
  why are you forcing federalization if this was a reason that uk escaped ? 
  why not to build eu with more independed countries ? 
  why are you forcing shape that is not acceptable by others ?
