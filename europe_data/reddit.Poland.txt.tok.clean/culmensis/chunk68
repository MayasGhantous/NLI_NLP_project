  why are you not obeying the law allowing ` reffuges ' to get to eu without any border-checking ? 
  why are you forcing other countries to do the same ? 
  why are you dismounting eu ? 
  i 'm not glad about it . 
  it 's just my observation which can be wrong . 
  i hope . 
  help ? 
  imho - no , we took what czechs took from us taking opportunity 20 years ago , when we were beasy fighting with ussr . 
  and please pay attention , that we are talking here about 1919 - not 1938 . 
  and we are not proud about the 1938 accidents . 
  we should not take it - even if czechs were - let 's say it using euphemism - not fair in 1919 . 
   what are you panicking about ? 
  i do n't like such a rhetoric . 
  if i would like to use your level of argumentation i would say : ` please do n't be hysterical and use merothic arguments if you have something valuable to say . ', 
  but i will not argue like that . 
   coughs in polish is it bavaria , swiss , italy or austria with the purple indicators north of you ? 
  imho germany will not lose anything . 
  for the first indicator that they could observe that thay can loose . 
  indicator that euro is not working for them - they will give up the euro project . 
  it 's to early to trying to judge trump . 
  will see . 
  but seriously - uk escaped from this leftist eu to not to reach their goal - now we - weaker countries that left in eu - do we have to agree to germany hegemony ? 
  give up national countries and make one big 4-th reich ? 
  - will tell you - germay is a little bit weak to try to do it again . 
  for the 3-td time . 
  will see . 
   all your posts related to it . 
  seriously ? 
  i just like a history and science . 
  for me it 's just stupid that any assessment of morality during wwii is the question : did you safe a jew during holocaust ? 
  if yes - you are a hero . 
  if no - you are collaborator at the best . 
  not a question about gypsy , poles , russian , belarusian , ukrainian , homos etc - but only jews . 
  a little bit strange . 
  we were living here in poland . 
  and we know the history . 
  history that are told by our families . 
  and not told only by external sources . 
  the same is imho for belarusian , russian or ukrainians . 
  for me personally - brother of my granpa was hung by germans in 1939 in mass murder of [ polish intheligenzia ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligenzaktion ) ( if you like pc - nazists not germans ) and none helped him - none blame our neighbours for lack of fight for their lives . 
  but if you are talking about [ t4 aktion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aktion_t4 ) - then it 's my teritory . 
  the first gass chambers in occuped poland were created and used by germans in 7 kilometers away - in the city of [ \u015awiecie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aktion_t4 ) in 1939 - here you have a poster from that time : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/euthanasiepropaganda.jpg . 
   even less people know about that polish-soviet conflict than about this  please read about [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_\\ ( 1920 \\ ) ) . 
  when poles [ were trying to safe europe again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_fifteen_decisive_battles_of_the_world ) : - you took your time to be brave and take some part when we were busy fighting with the communists . 
  friends like you are better to be keept go ahead . 
  how it 's seen in czech ( ia ) ? 
  do you consider that at that time that ussr wanted to expand their territories and we were trying to stop them ? 
   i think both options can work . 
  i 'm personally a proponent of two tiers with an academic and a vocational path in tier two , but i also think the best solution is the parallel existence of different models and to give parents the choice . 
  good recipe - how to hold two magpies tail . 
  you can be a politician . 
  it 's not a reliable index . 
  based on the question whether asked mr. or ms. believe that your country has bribery . 
  or not . 
  it 's not based on question if you were bribed or you bribed someone . 
  fcuk them - record the moment of taking the bribe , and publish it when you get the license . 
  something like stop-ham movement - which imho escaped from control . 
  hidden camers would not help ? 
   they gave me change !!!, 
  nice one  in slovakia police-man took as in his police-car to the city from rural place to go to the atm machine to take a cash for bribing , 
  exactly . 
  yet another index and yet another map . 
  exactly . 
  better criterion would be the question : did you corrupt somenone last year or did someone corrupt you ? 
  for me the answers are ` no ' , ` no ' . 
  i remember times in poland - let 's say 15 years ago , when bribing police was a national sport . 
  it was like this : 1 . 
  they stoped you while driving . 
  they had reason - speeding , red light etc. 
  they invited you to the car - there were 2 police-men , but one gone outside and you sat with only one in the police-car ( without witnesses ) . 
  it was win-win situation . 
  you can pay bigger mandate - they can earn nothing . 
  they started to ask - mr. name - where are you working ? 
  me - it . 
  them - ooo i heard that you earn a lot of money . 
  me - nonono - not a lot i 'm just a simple programist . 
  they - ok . ok . you made this and this - what can we do with that ? 
  me - alternative solution ? 
  which one ? 
  warning ? 
  for example ? 
  13 . nonono - no warning . 
  there is the mandat for that . 
  can we make a deal ? 
  it was the win-win situation . 
  but suddenly 15 years ago when i proposed alternative solution from point 10 the police-man turned radio-station on . 
  to have a witness . 
  i spoted that and it was last time to bribe someone  be careful - if you bribe police-man in poland you can have big troubles . 
  really . 
  they have rewards for it . 
   the topic of this perception index is , in my understanding , mostly about endemic corruption in the government and public institutions , which the population deals directly with . 
  if you need to give an `` attention '' to a doctor , or your kid 's teacher to take `` extra good care '' of them , then you will feel this infinitely more than the fact that a company paid bribes to italian car manufacturers to buy their ecu 's . 
  for me this index is how people percevied thier country overall . 
  for me - better index would be depending on the question - ` were you bribed last year ' or ` do you bribed someone last year ' . 
  and not what is your imagination about the whole country is . 
  we can ask this question here . 
  for me is : ` no ' . 
  imho it 's not work like this - it 's simple question - do you consider your country as corrupt one ? 
  not the question - how many times did you corrupted someone in let 's say - last year . 
  not the question - how many times were you corrupted .
