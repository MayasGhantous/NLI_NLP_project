  shapes of old empires are still visible . 
  imho it is hard to compare . 
  before the iww there was no czechoslovakia , poland , hungary , yugoslavia etc. 
  they were parts of other countries : germany , russia , and austro-hungarian empire . 
  in case of poland there was huge differences between lands inherited from the occupants . 
  here you have a map of today rail lines : http://kolej.one.pl/mapy/1/1088025256.png . 
  you can see the borders of old empires even today . 
  i did not say that it not exists . 
  to be more exact : i have not seen anyone using carpet-beater nowdays and rug-hangers are not built today . 
  you probably live in a flat that was built some time ago . 
  honestly - i have no idea . 
  maybe a swede could comment it ? 
  yes !, 
  all my family watched it together . 
  and also rumcajs and ' \u017bwirek i muchomorek ' ( poh\u00e1dky z mechu a kaprad\u00ed ) . 
  thank you !, 
  and [ this one ] ( http://c0834752.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/01vhnwv_ddli2fu8fmpin151v042mg2cljaeh6xw,wat.jpg?author=ronin88666&amp;auth=7f8f8b081b4e8118ccd1822ab60c7d34 ) taken from swedish school books ( geography ) , 
  according to my father you are right . 
  hoovers were quite popular but many people used a carpet-beater for better effects . 
  you could also put a rug on a snow and use carpet-beater . 
  i have not seen this for many years . 
  rug hangers are not even built these days . 
  yet another thing that passed away . 
  not from my country but i like it : ** ussr ** [ the master and margarita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_master_and_margarita ) it is woven around a visit by the devil to the fervently atheistic soviet union . 
  many critics consider it to be one of the best novels of the 20th century , and the foremost of soviet satires . 
  in part , it is angled against a suffocatingly bureaucratic social order . 
  and non-fiction : [ aquarium ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aquarium_ ( suvorov \\ ) ) is a partly autobiographical description by viktor suvorov of the gru ( soviet military intelligence directorate ) . 
  european languages not derived from proto-indo-european : basque , hungarian , finnish , estonian , karelian , sami and turkish . 
  nope . 
  according to the data you paid 92,21 . 
  it 's enough for spain . 
  for poland you should have paid three times more . 
   meanwhile russia is the country of the future with everything they need . 
  how ? 
  when shale gas will become available in europe , russia will lose the only source of income . 
   shit poland has been fighting for this for years now , it takes a crisis for europe to understand the value of this . 
  thanks to putin !, 
  the polish forces as a whole are considered to have been the 4th largest allied army in europe , after the soviet union , united states and britain . 
  actually if you look at the map , the british/us/polish troops stopped at the elbe river . 
  they never fought on the polish soil . 
  unlike polish troops involved in battle of britain . 
  poland is between russia and germany . 
  for us it always caused troubles when russia and germany were got along over our heads . 
  for us it reminds [ partitions of poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) and [ ribbentrop-molotov pact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  by now as i understand poland is in eu together with germany and we should play in the same team . 
  this issue with nordstream bypass is hard to understand for me in criterion of solidarity , costs , environmental protection and efficiency . 
  the only reason seemed to be that german did not treat poland as equal , trustworthy partner and pushed us under russian influence . 
  this project gave russians possibility to blackmail poles by turning down the gas tap . 
  it was not fair . 
  sikorski said that it reminds ribbentrop-molotov pact and he was right . 
  it reminds . 
  he never used the nazis word as far as i remember . 
  i 'm trying to guess what do you mean . 
  could you give maybe some examples ? 
   we went to war for you guys . 
  what do you mean by ` we ' and ` you ' ? 
  it is opposite . 
  we call german ` german ' and nazis also ` german ' . 
  this is why czechs need churches . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg_ ( city ) #european _ institutions  luxembourg city is the seat of several institutions of the european union , including the european court of justice , the european commission , the secretariat of the european parliament , the european court of auditors and the european investment bank . 
  and it 's population is less than 100,000 people . 
   and that does not take into account the tens of billions of pounds that polish farmers continue to receive in agricultural subsidies from brussels . 
  all farmers in eu are subsidized . 
  unfortunatelly not in the same way - the 10 new member states were subsidized less than ` old europeans ' . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/archives/enlargement_process/future_prospects/negotiations/eu10_bulgaria_romania/chapters/chap_7_en.htm ) document :  the 10 new member states will gradually phase in eu agricultural direct payments between 2004 and 2013 . 
  direct payments will start at 25 % in 2004 , 30 % in 2005 and 35 % in 2006 of the present system and increase by 10 percentage steps to reach 100 % of the then applicable eu level in 2013 . 
  bulgaria and romania , joining the eu in 2007 , will have equivalent treatment and will phase in direct payments starting at 25 % in 2007 to reach 100 % in 2016 . 
   none has benefited more from membership than poland . 
  first and foremost , there 's the cash : the country received # 56bn that is true only for the absolute value . 
  imho poland has bigger population than other countries and it always will be at the top . 
  according to [ eu : total contributions and spending ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union ) the difference between total spend and total contribution per person looks like this : country | spend $ per person | contribution $ per person | balance per person : -- | -- :| -- :| -- :| luxembourg | 3025,40 | 544,76 | 2480,64 lithuania | 541,44 | 84,33 | 457,11 hungary | 533,85 | 83,76 | 450,09 greece | 577,98 | 155,80 | 422,18 latvia | 439,11 | 77,00 | 362,11 belgium | 617,85 | 304,12 | 313,73 portugal | 446,01 | 151,28 | 294,73 poland | 374,79 | 83,77 | 291,02 estonia | 376,58 | 101,98 | 274,6 slovenia | 413,12 | 159,47 | 253,65 slovakia | 331,04 | 106,87 | 224,17 malta | 325,72 | 135,65 | 190,07 czech republic | 288,85 | 139,41 | 149,44 ireland | 358,75 | 249,23 | 109,52 bulgaria | 150,23 | 46,96 | 103,27 spain | 294,65 | 213,99 | 80,66 romania | 124,19 | 52,12 | 72,07 cyprus | 218,60 | 190,71 | 27,89 croatia | 25,68 | 0,00 | 25,68 austria | 223,20 | 297,37 | -74,17 france | 202,35 | 277,50 | -75,15 united kingdom | 105,12 | 180,38 | -75,26 italy | 157,69 | 235,84 | -78,15 germany | 148,41 | 240,62 | -92,21 finland | 240,55 | 335,39 | -94,84 netherlands | 123,94 | 236,15 | -112,21 denmark | 264,91 | 381,39 | -116,48 sweden | 186,61 | 304,46 | -117,85, 
  op tried to say how many goods could be bought in poland for the average salary in 2003 and 2013 . 
  the conclusion is that in 2013 poles can buy fewer goods for the average salary . 
  they are talking about the need for quotas of women on electoral lists . 
  in poland it is used - but not widely . 
  it is written to the dictionary of polish language http://sjp.pl/gastarbeiter . 
  it has alternative form in polish language : gastarbajter . 
  gastarbeiters from eastern europe work for that company . 
  we will have to rebuild schools into nursing homes . 
  it is about 600\u00a0000\u00a0000 kg . 
  but thanks . 
  michnik is a pole of jewish origin .

  it exists in czech domain : http://sk.2nite.cz/search/odchody-autobusu/, 
  sorry for that - it was from different websites . 
  every sentence sounds like czech language . 
  i do not know if every is correct , but every is funny . 
  very  edit : btw - which one is incorrect ? 
  german coast guard example . 
  old but funny . 
  great people and great country . 
  we have some students from ukraine in our town . 
  one of the best professor in my university was ukrainian from lviv . 
  now they are fighting for independence from russian influence just like poland 30 years ago . 
  in poland , the slovak products are not in any way evaluated . 
  i 'm trying to remember a thing that comes from slovakia - but i do not know any of this , unfortunately . 
  ` g\u00f3wno ' word comes from proto-indo-european language .
