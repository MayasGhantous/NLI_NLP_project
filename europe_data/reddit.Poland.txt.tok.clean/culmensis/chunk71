  so - why do you often distinguish people by ` algerian man ' or ` algerian-swede ' ? 
  it should have no matter . 
  what should matter is the level of integration with swedish culture and society . 
  is the level of integration differs for people born in sweden and the new ones ? 
   algerian man , not saying algerian-swede because i dont know what is the criterion that you put someone into the box with a label : ` algerian man ' or ` algerian-swede ' ? 
  the fact of being born in or out of sweden ? 
  or belonging to the swedish or algerian culture ? 
  just curious . 
  exactly . 
  there were some attempts to post the news here . 
  but their were removed . 
  now it 's ok - because of news without pictures . 
  26 milion - but with or without estonia ? 
  i bet the reason will be the famous ` local news ' . 
  what do you think ? 
  hope , it 's not at the same level of emotions [ like in the usa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klaz4ts0-y4 ) . 
  i like it and i hope - we will be the first in europe in this factor very soon . 
   he must be a good guy . 
  exactly . 
  god bless orban !, 
  [ god , bless the hungarians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhhit5ujgyi ) !, 
  he is financing many controversial movements . 
  for example there were some time ago a famous movement ' [ femen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/femen ) ' . 
  there are rumors , that [ soros stopped to support and financing them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k8zueti.png ) . 
  hungarian pm orban also takes aim at soros and hungarian ngos [ warnings that groups funded by financier could be forced out of country ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/20d291f8-d87b-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e ) . 
   looks dutch to me . 
  have you got such a big hills there ? 
   yes , we have mett . 
  probably it 's the same as polish [ metka ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=metka&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) , but it 's kind of different meal . 
  metka is usually made from pork and tatar from beef . 
  and it taste quite different . 
  if you did not try tatar - you should !, 
  they refer to the polish tv series ' [ four tank-men and a dog ] ( http://1.fwcdn.pl/ph/51/55/35155/490902_1.1.jpg ) ' that was popular in communist countries . 
  most of this ` culinary horror ' is because of using blood . 
  here in poland we have for example a [ tatar ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=tatar&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) that is made from raw beef served with raw yolk , onion and soured cucumbers . 
  have you got something like that in your country ? 
  [ duck blood soup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czernina ) - [ czernina ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=czernina&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) - i rememer it from my childhood in my grandma house . 
  i liked it then . 
  now i realised how it 's made and i dont eat it . 
  but it was very tasty . 
  full names , dates and amount of money , 
   you 're not living in communist times anymore , so now would be just the right time to get an education . 
  we are not living in nazi times anymore , so now would be just the right time to get an education . 
  for me it 's just like arguing that some nazis ideologists did not want for example to kill all the slavic people . 
  and we should appreciate they work and point of views . 
  and that not all the nazis was bad . 
  only a part . 
  sorry - i lived during communist times and for me they are all evil , bloody bastards . 
  all of them . 
  for me she was just another communist . 
  i do n't distinguish between good or bad communists . 
  i also not distinguish between good or bad nazis . 
   unfortunately there are also people born in '90s who think stalin was a great leader and we need man like him again . 
  there are n't many of them though . 
  i met once a man in his 40 from crimea ( at that time ukraine ) and he was praising stalin too . 
  that he cared about people , that he was proud man , that every nation respected him , etc. 
  it was just sad . 
  thank you for your response - the bigger respect for you !, 
  i 'm just wonder if they would not died , what kind of communist rule would they implement ? 
  such as in lenin-stalin ussr , mao china , pol pot in cambodia or that their one would be just cool ? 
  more seriously - they were ideologists and activists one of the most dangerous and murderous ideologies . 
  they should be forgotten like nazis . 
  they graves should be forgotten like grave of nazis.apologetics of such a person 's or communists ideology should be treated like apologetics of nazi ideology . 
  from the same paragraphs of the law . 
   fuck commies i 'm glad that i can hear such a statements from a russian . 
  i really appreciate it . 
  respect . 
  is your opinion popular in russia ? 
   by leaving countries to do what they want otherwise ( like poland ) . 
  you have the first minus sign / s. 
  let 's make an revolution for class society of uk . 
  in the name of libert\u00e9 , \u00c9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 - for all of the audience or with the ` ou la mort ' part , perseved for the smarter part . 
  never realised that exists such a bunch of ignorants that did not know their own history . 
   hdi , split in thirds . 
  some kind of henry , diana and ibrahim families sitting at round table and moving tin soldiers on the map ? 
  let 's see what trump will do with this decision of outgoing obama . 
  what are the criterion ? 
  hope it 's a metter of history and her ^ * ad hoc needs rather than lack of our taste . 
  ^ * word ` history ' is femine in polish language . 
   this looks like it was intended for finland . 
  imho in this case it would be more single micro-playgrounds built in appropriate distance . 
  the rule of law is probably like that : on 1000 square meters for apartments , there should be 1 square meter of playground and 0.5 sm of grocery shop , 
  please note , that current gov is not liked by currently rulling elites in eu and journalists . 
  it 's the same attitude for uk after brexit . 
  it could be you if you dare choose something that elites do n't like . 
  your pov and povs of other people are created by information from a few sources . 
  imho they are forming not fair view of poland and polish gov. 
  please let me correct you ( please check if i 'm right or not ) :  there was the the abortion ban which failed , it was not our gov proposal . 
  it was some ngo proposal and was not accepted by our parliament . 
   deal with censoring the press and the opposition seriously - i have no idea what are you talking about . 
  if you are talking about changing in ceos in national tv and radio - than you are right . 
  but it happened all the time , during gov changing . 
   problems with your judicial independence . 
  this mess was started by our previous gov ( friends of eu elites ) and noone was concerned about it . 
  the current one is trying to clean the mess imho . 
  i do n't blame you . 
  i understand that people 's pov are easly to manipulate . 
  i have respect for you romanians , your last changes ( taxes , fight with corruption etc ) . 
  if i was in your shoes , i would take the opportunity that poland has bad press and try to sell view of romania as a current leader of changes in ee . 
   but the truth is that your government is going a bit crazy .
