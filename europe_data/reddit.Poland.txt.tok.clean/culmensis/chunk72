  why do you think so ? 
  if you are chemists hobbyists , you could be interested in [ devices for the separation of liquids ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=profesjonalny+aparat+destylacyjny&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch ) ? 
   we 're poorer than russia and poland ? 
  fucking seriously ? 
  whenever you were richer than poland ? 
  hard to compare for over 120 years of partitions and 50 years of communism . 
   they occupied us too . 
  for how long ? 
  artillery + [ airbonrne early warning and control ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airborne_early_warning_and_control ) + satelites + drones . 
  nice . 
  when i was in mockba there were no these skyscrapers . 
  have to travel again . 
  and do n't you think that the buildings are lonely from this perspective ? 
  thank you for your rational voice . 
  i 'm not a fan of current government ( obligatory denial to not to be treated as an redneck or an idiot by our enlightened polish part of / r/europe ) , but this fact can be interesting for germans imho :  macierewicz was expelled from andrzej frycz modrzewski high school for political reasons in 1965 , specifically for refusing to denounce the [ letter of reconciliation of the polish bishops to the german bishops ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_of_reconciliation_of_the_polish_bishops_to_the_german_bishops ) . 
  he was then 17 years old . 
   and what about the other side that so full of themselves that they disregard procedures and opposition examples ? 
   rightfully taking advantage of that opposition is not a monolith . 
  former po behaves like a bunch of ruthless cynics , opportunists that would sacrifice poland if it would help them to ~ ~ get power back ~ ~ [ take the power back ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkmsxchqyg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=93 ) . 
  imho the opposition from former government can not accept democratic election in poland . 
  and they are doing everything to get rid of current one . 
  on every method . 
  this particular one imho was to not to let the current parliament to accept the budget - so as to have a pretext to terminate parliament . 
  they were ` occupying ' the parliament for different pretexts : to let journalists to enter the sejm without any governance - it was accepted , they demand footages from particular cameras - was given . 
  for me they are not responsible and dangerous people . 
  they would imho burn poland if they will take the government again . 
  just like a bunch of not responsible hooligans . 
  glad that they lost . 
  in poland it 's called [ kotlet schabowy z ziemniakami ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=kotlet+schabowy+z+ziemniakami&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) . 
  edit : [ wait a minute ] ( http://republika.pl/blog_hm_5057280/7845693/tr/schabowy_w_panierce_tymiankowej.jpg ) . 
  i bet ( san ) salvador . 
  why do you think that a simple slip of the tongue deserves such international interest ? 
   po 's mess was all cleaned in tribunal verdict of 3.12.2015 . 
  the mess was started by former government . 
  what pis is trying to do is to clean this mess imho . 
  in which case ? 
  and i think that it would be interesting , if members of this party would describe what are differences between them and for example pis . 
   perhaps they are pro-democracy and rule of law ? 
  imho it 's just a truism , on which every party would agree with . 
   poles massacred ukrainians before . 
  sources ? 
  it could be a provocation . 
  let 's hope their police will find people who did that . 
  where are you from and how do you know that ? 
  imho we lost our humanity when we are judging people that are pro-life as extremists . 
  we have rallies in poland in 1-st may too . 
  and noone take them as extremist . 
  what we consider as extremists are people that raising their right hand and vowing : haj hitler !, 
  people that using hakenkreuz or swastic in their flags . 
  as well as people that uses murderers as che gevaura or communists ideologists such as marx or lenin in their flags . 
  they are all socialists that tried to change the world according to their views . 
  the first - from west - were national socialists and the other - from east - were international socialists.thus we do n't like all of that socialists ideology , their spin doctors , the new world order , socialists paradigms , etc. 
  all we want is to live without the war . 
  for the next generation . 
  that 's all . 
   also , a lot of people send donations . 
  any sources ? 
   or maybe you are in political minority here . 
  more probably . 
   i think downvotes come because you write things like `` fuck you razem , go somewhere else '' . 
  that reason was exposed in another thread - only careful watchers could spot that . 
  thank you . 
   can we do something similar to apple ( tax ) , mcd ( tax ) and giant squid ( interest manipulation ) executives in eu ? 
  yes we can . 
  let 's first look at our former politicians from tax haven countries that are now our european vip 's . 
  in this particular example : [ president of the european commission - jean claude juncker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-claude_juncker ) . 
   relationship with church is a big one for many . 
  agree - it 's the point that differs from pis . 
  such as palikot movement and other exotic parties from our past . 
  but i hope that this time they have samething to say - realy smart and important . 
  but what their supporters have despite of arguments ? 
  downwote . 
  in which points , your declarations are different from our today 's socialist pis government and why to choose you instead of them ? 
   czech police these days where can i watch more movies with this lady ? 
  all i want to say - that according to west ( and you ) nazis are totally bad . 
  and i mean toootaaalyy . 
  without exceptions . 
  and communist are so-so . 
  and according to nations conquered by communists ( you were not - fins ) communists are as equal bad as nazis . 
  that 's all . 
  you can predict all of the scenarious of our talk that you are trying to draw . 
   sure , i know it 's in the other ballpark . 
  that still does n't mean it 's wise to just dismiss an entire party on the basis of the fact that one of their leaders was in the same demonstration as a communist ten years ago . 
  would you be so relativistic if a leader would take an engaged part in nazi demonstration too ? 
  being one of the few speakers and leaders ? 
   uh , you might have heard of a couple of wars finland had with soviet union . 
  of course i heard about it . 
  and i can assure you that finland in poland is considered as a hero nation and appreciated by that winter war . 
  but please - do n't compare finland with communist terror on teritories that were really taken by communists . 
   kudos to them for not taking any sides in the pis-po conflict . 
  they are too marginal - below the standard error . 
  they are living in their own world of ideology and 3.000.000 pln subsidy from us - thanks to last elections . 
  noone reasonable is interested and asking them what they think . 
  thus this try in leftist / r/europe imho . 
   i love poland !, 
  :d all the best for you guys !, 
  thank you !, 
  hope we will get rid of all far left socialist : national socialists and international socialists too . 
  i do n't believe people that revere and worship the communist monster . 
  have you been in such a demonstration with nazis or fasist too ?
