  i would not like to . 
  but if you are talking about our modern history artefatcs - i would like to take them back . 
  would you like to compare national treasures stolen and kept in different countries ? 
  would be interesting . 
  swedes are one of the biggest thief in history - it 's my theory . 
  have you got any sources that deny this claim ? 
   if we start returning works of art , should we also go back to 18th century borders ? 
  good moral question . 
  should we go back all stollen artefacts ? 
  or should we keep them ? 
  this is the question . 
   swedes ca n't read polish latine meus filium . 
   that if i walk polish museums i wo n't find a single stolen item ? 
  doubtful . 
  come , walk and find . 
  you are wellcome . 
   was it not `` fair game '' in the earlier wars of europe ? 
  it 's hard to justify earlier wars in europe . 
  for sure there were factors that are not present in current days . 
  but if someone keep stolen artefacts - imho we should call that person as thief or a fence or ` receiver of stolen goods ' . 
   they certainly would want to be on the first place ... 
  certainly they need ` returning wartime loots capitan sweden ' . 
  and this one would be more appreciated . 
   oh , they 're `` spoils of war '' . 
  good for you that you had no war in 200 years . 
   but could you provide some description on how they were stolen ? 
  i ca n't provide exact description for every item . 
  but imho , if we are talking about polish artefacts , that were in poland before [ swedish deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history \\ ) ) , and after it they are in swedish museums , libraries and towns . 
  it had must be stolen . 
  do n't you think so ? 
  if not even swedish stolen them - which i doubt , you kept them . 
  after 36 minutes from publishing my post it is scored -5 . 
  without any explanations - how many taxes did the controversial party ` razem ' payed to our common polihs taxes treasury from their 3.000.000,00 pln netto subsidy ? 
  what they did with that money ? 
  any brave member of your party would like to explain ? 
   our only actual left-wing party ( razem ) who is our ? 
  noone cares about your controversial party . 
  you got rid of sld from our political view , and it 's just the only good that comes from you . 
  on the other hand - you should pay taxes from your 3.000.000,00 subsidy . 
  about 70 % ? , 90 % , 99 % ? 
  how much did you pay in taxes ? 
  exactly - especially such a white and soft mascot as sweden - which is always good and always want to teach others how to live . 
  and while they keep their teaching finger pointing at others , they keep back their looted not so long ago trophies at the same time . 
  for me it 's just a hypocrisy . 
  this collection was in the hands of polish family . 
  and we took it back on occasional price . 
  on the other hand we had many collections that belongs to our nation and are now in the hands of thiefs from other countries . 
  it would be great if we could take it back .

   if you follow this logic germans also should n't be allowed to criticize sinti , roma , communists , homeless , slavs , gays and a bunch of other people . 
  exactly . 
  i was just wonder - because the germans are criticizing our new government all the last year long , every single day , without any consequences . 
   they should say absolutely nothing to criticize the jews . 
  why should germans limit their criticizing only for the jews , according to you ?

  economy eu wide is recovering to pre 2008 levels , immigration flow is lowering ( altho for how long , might be incidental ) , isis is getting wrekked and its christmas . 
  perhaps 2017 will be a good year again . 
  nearly 10 years of crisis after crisis is enough for us europeans :p . let 's hope . 
  let me be a little bit conservative and not political correct and say : ' [ marry christmas to you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfigils-ynk ) ' . 
  i 'm afraid that we will need such a person as a hero and as symbol and personification of sacrifice in near future struggle .
