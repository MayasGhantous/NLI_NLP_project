  the validity of the examples can be questioned . 
  please compare the total amount of money received by different countries by different criterions . 
  for example population , area of country etc. 
  if you would like to count it in per capita criterion it will not so biased and obvious . 
  poland is quite big country and has guite big population . 
  and it 's quite easy to sum all of the money for single country . 
  you would be suprised that countires such as luxemburg , or portugal received more per capita money than poland from eu treasury . 
  if you are talking about eu money and that money was the inflection point for poland - please point the point on this [ chart ] ( http://statinfo.biz/html/m272f6918a1956l2.aspx ) showing polish gdp per capita - when we started to taking your money ? 
  when we started to develop ? 
  i met some people from ukraine and belarus in poland . 
  some of them are pediatrists and cardiologists - they were tought in their countries . 
  they decided to stay here because of bigger sallaries . 
  at the same time i felt bad - we drain them from their families , countries . 
  do n't you ? 
  edit : just spot this fragment :  poles are by far the biggest winner in the whole eu and probably that has something to do with the fact that german slaughtered a good chunk of it population during wwii . 
  no comment . 
  you can not buy everything . 
  germans killed many of my family members . 
  hope it 's not price for my grandpas . 
  if so - you killed more belarusians for example - per capita of course . 
  or romas . 
  give them your money and take back 85 % and be the good one . 
  who knows - maybe you will rich 90 % of efficiency it these cases ? 
   first and foremost , there 's the cash : if you like this criterion ( money ) i 'm just trying to explain , that every 100 euro ` invested ' by germany , 85 % is received back by your companies - so please dont use raw amount of money to prove your claims . 
  on the other hand - please pay attention , that the condition to access the eu for poland was to sell our factories , buissneses , it was so called ` privatisation ' . 
  at that time we were taught , that buisiness have no roots and we should do it . 
  contrary last time i heard that selling german factories to chinesse is bad and you would like not to do it . 
  for me it 's just hipocrisy . 
  you also drain our brains educated by polish universiteis by our - polish - money - doctors , engineears and others . 
  do you really want to compare it in only raw numbers of actual received money ? 
  / u/popopoleroidupaindep wrote :  claim a pole , in polish on a polish newspaper . 
   look it 's really easy , poland has been the biggest sucker of eu money since it joined and germans have been , by far , those who gave the most . 
  just want to try put your attention that world is not black and white . 
  that all the spending money is not only giving , but also receiving . 
  i found articles with sources , that on every 100 euro given to poland , 85 euro backs to germany . 
  would you like comment it ? 
  have you any other , better sources ? 
  what is the balance according to you ? 
   german taxepayers send their money to poland . 
  money that could have been spent in germany . 
  you flair is signaling that you are from kuyavian-pomerania region . 
  i 'm from che\u0142mno and according to this [ map ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_b87khlih200q1co1apbgy66nkecjjdug.jpg ) you seem to be from southern-east part of it . 
  am i right ? 
   i do n't really care i care - it should be the same criterion of judging for all . 
   as long the nepotism and partisanship of the offices goes away in the process . 
  we all agree at that and it 's just a truism imho - you are right , and i agree that we should get rid of nepotism . 
   what do you mean by that ? 
  all the people from tusk to kaczynski by kwa\u015bniewski , miller , etc. 
  are the people from the same generation and are exchanging in the government table . 
  i had impression that you are young fighter that would like to divide people in criterion of age and found a recipe to happines by get rid all of the older and replace them by younger ones . 
  for me it 's just a hypocrisy that all the current , vocal white-snows did not anything when former government broke a constitution and now the same people are crying crocodile tears about the consequences of their inaction . 
  i do n't think that we should exchange all of the people from our political jet-set-society . 
  it 's smell like a revolution and collective responsibility . 
  i do n't see any better alternative . 
  hope you are not agitating for ` razem ' . 
    it applies to the former government ( s ) imho . 
   and it should not happen with any government . 
  this shit has to stop . 
  agree . 
  but accusing only this one is imho just an hypocrisy . 
   dismantling ct , very incompetent people in ruling positions , voting in the middle of the night on questionable laws and decisions it applies to the former government ( s ) imho . 
   ruining the economy ( 500 + agree . 
  it can not only ruining our economy , but also keeping alive a ` soviet people ' - people for whom the ` give me , give me ' attitude is a way of life . 
  i 'm not sure about school system - i have many friends that are teachaers and they have different oppinons . 
  i can see some pro and cons . 
   lowering the working age again without any data exactly - it 's the same as 500 + for me . 
  imho - we should count on ourserlfs and not a institutions . 
  i agree that they are the left-wing in the criterion of the economy and social welfare . 
  but they are the right-wing in the criterion of the attitude to a family , abortion , the catholic church , patriotism etc. 
  and that is the reason of portraying them in bad light . 
   majority of our population does n't like the currently ruling government either . 
  i 'm not a big fan of pis , but what i remember , polls gives pis the first place . 
   so it 's really rare as i said - not in here . 
  kuyavian and pomerania regions . 
  because intelectual elites ( journalists and politicians ) in europe comes from leftists 68 movement , and they do n't like currently ruling government in poland . 
  it 's the same for uk after their vote against eu . 
  i 'm from the part of poland , where star-man ( gwiazdor ) is bringing presents . 
  in polish it 's the same word like ` movie-star ' - so it 's just a little confusing and strange for people from other part of poland . 
   what is she ? 
  [ baba yaga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baba_yaga ) :  in slavic folklore , baba yaga / \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0b\u0259 j\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0 / [ 1 ] ( russian : \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0430-\u044f\u0433\u0430 ) is a supernatural being ( or one of a trio of sisters of the same name ) who appears as a deformed and/or ferocious-looking woman . 
  baba yaga flies around in a mortar , wields a pestle , and dwells deep in the forest in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs ( or sometimes a single chicken leg ) . 
  [ 2 ] baba yaga may help or hinder those that encounter or seek her out . 
  she sometimes plays a maternal role , and also has associations with forest wildlife . 
  according to vladimir propp 's folktale morphology , baba yaga commonly appears as either a donor or villain , or may be altogether ambiguous . 
  but she is old . 
  it 's just the magic . 
  like many other famous poles . 
  during [ great emigration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_emigration ) many our poets , composers , writers etc emigrated to [ paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%b4tel_lambert#a_political_salon ) where they worked on the preservation and promotion of polish culture and keeping the `` polish question '' alive in european politics , by continually keeping the polish cause on the agenda . 
  there were no polish passports at that time . 
  even more - there were no poland . 
  o jesus you are so tough germans / s. 
  have you considered not to spread free pocket money for everybody instead ? 
  you can stop all the ` refugee ' movement in your 's europe right now if you only want to do it . 
  why do you do it ? 
  what is the goal of your movement ? 
   without a doubt yes please justify this thesis with examples and sources . 
   i could n't tell you . 
  i fell asleep after 5 minutes of watching it . 
  then you should see ' [ ida ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2718492/ ) ' . 
  this movie gives you energy and joy of life for few weeks .
