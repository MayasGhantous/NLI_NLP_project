  [ gu\u032fou ] ( http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/pokornymaster-x.html ) means ` cow ' , later ` cow 's shit ' . 
  never heard . 
  i have to justify - for many years the only romanian we saw was gypsy . 
  and all the stereotypes are caused by our ignorance . 
   but , would it be that easy to get rid of the negative connotations ? 
  of course - it is changing now . 
   up until 90s most polish people knew romanians ( or rather they idea of romanians ) by the shady folks who came to poland to beg , steal , whore etc. 
  that is truth . 
  i remember when i saw for a first time a white romanian kid - the first thing that comes to my mind was : ` jesus christ , they kidnapped him !, 
  poor kid . ', 
  unfortunatelly for many people gypsy and romanian are synonyms . 
  my company is cooperating with romanian one - imho they are very profesional comparing to other ones . 
  i also met some people from romania and i have only positive experiences . 
  it looks like but it is not butter  . 
  the lard is made from [ fatback ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatback ) and it has pices of meat in fat that taste like fried bacon . 
  you can compare pierogi to tortellinis but pierogi are bigger and can have different stuffing . 
  pyzy are made from grated potatos . 
  pierogi as in the pictures in russian are called ` plemeni ' . 
  russians pierogi are quite [ different ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirog ) and [ pierozki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirozhki ) as well . 
  etymology of the word ` pierogi ' is not known for sure . 
  according to one theory it comes from ural tribes . 
  so maybe we took the word from you , 
  bread with lard . 
  not for dinner but very tasty and probably unhealthy . 
   car thieves in czech ? 
  hard to believe . 
  and what we are stealing over there ? 
  skoda ? 
  happens . 
  anyway - imho it is worth trying . 
  jaceniuk is probably waiting for any news that could give people any kind of hope - for example modern e-tax system that is beyond european . 
  why not ? 
  goverment customer is one of the best . 
  no one from officials will responsible for their decisions and mistakes . 
  you are safe in this case . 
  if you have addicted goverment for your solution - you are winner . 
  good luck . 
  just go and sell them your solution . 
  i can help in this case for 200 euro per hour . 
  nice research . 
  are you going to write some software ? 
  need some help ? 
  100 euro per hour . 
  lithuania looks like a patchwork . 
  ashkenazim hates sephardim , sephardim hate ashkenazim , both hate orthodox haredim and haredim hate secular jews . 
  thank god that you have added the second sentence . 
  communists used to call such a phenomenon : [ useful idiot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot ) . 
  do not forget about [ soviet invasion of poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) 17 september 1939 . 
  in accordance with the [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  it seems like lack of ` thou ' word in english . 
  maybe it is worth to rebirth it ? 
   as awful as it sounds , poland and the baltics would simply not be worth a nuclear wwiii . 
  imho no country is worth nuclear war . 
  but from the 1945 no one used nuclear weapon . 
  from that time there was ( and are ) many international conflicts in which nuclear powers were involved . 
  imho we can not let people do whatever they want only becouse they have dangerous weapons in their hands . 
  only determined attitude can stop the bandits ( like [ cuban missle crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuban_missile_crisis ) ) . 
  i know that eastern europe is far away , but we can discuss the same problem in relation to former russian influence parts like east germany ( fomer ddr ) - hope it will change attitude . 
  i do not want to justify the behavior of the crowd , but riding in a convoy with russian and soviet flags on ukrainian streets after the annexation of the crimea looks like a provocation and certainly is not a good idea . 
  it was stupid and rude statement . 
  polish public opinion was appalled by that . 
  the author - w\u0119glarczyk - apologized . 
   some `` just do n't like them and they crucified jesus '' , others go as far as to threaten jews with death . 
  i do not know anyone who uses the arguments about the crucifixion of jesus or ` threaten jews with death ' . 
  on the other side the argument ` antisemite ' is used very often as an argument ended discussion . 
  it is very roomy - houses the people who do not agree with the policies of israel , mentioning history of the jews , not only in the context of holocaust victims or dare to discuss the thesis applied by the environment of ` gazeta wyborcza ' ( the biggest polish daily run by pople with jews origins ) . 
  with this definition of antisemitism , i think your estimates are correct . 
  the population of jews in poland is negligible compared with the period before world war ii . 
  despite this , people with jews origins are prominent and important positions in poland . 
  i would like to mention , bartoszewski statement about polish present-day ` antisemitism ' : ` please mention another country of the european union , which in the past 15 years has had three foreign ministers - geremek rotfeld , meller of jewish origin ' . 
  i can add the names of the leading jewish origins journalists having a significant influence on the soul of poles such as michnik or urban . 
  i do not know rules on this portal . 
  i think that there is quite interesting discusion in this thread . 
  if your post will have some points then i will delete . 
  modern russia is the legal successor of the ussr . 
  to this day russia has not distanced itself from the activities of the soviets . 
  putin said that ` the collapse of the ussr was not only the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century , but also a real tragedy for the russians . ', 
  it seems that today you are trying to restore russian empire . 
  that 's right . 
  they changed the title and the content . 
  from the link i sent :  when the need to defend the republic , clashed in a battle with the forces of the teutonic knights , fought the russians and swedes , as well as his comrades , which is not believed to be brothers , but the invaders . 
  from the other hand it 's strange to hate someone because of xvii century history . 
  there is already [ tatars minority in poland ] ( http://translate.google.pl/translate?hl=pl&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tatarzy.pl%2fhistoria%2ftatarzy_polscy.html ) . 
  they are with us from xiv century . 
  they are and were loyal polish citizens . 
  [ 200.000 crimean tatars was deported from crimea by soviet regime in 1944 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_the_crimean_tatars ) . 
  it seems that the eu solidarity border lies on pigs . 
   close nord stream . 
  exactly . 
  for me it seems that after putin 's shah-mat they are trying to be alpha males for their own audience by spreading ` force ' policy . 
  easy way to keep face . 
  it seems that they have similar sense of beauty . 
  i confirm . 
  it 's true and it 's sad . 
  it 's very interesting . 
   did polish government pay the owners who closed these plants ? 
  i have no idea . 
  but what is worse frequently the sugar factories were the only places when people could find work for some areas . 
  now they are without work . 
  but what is the worst , the eu now is planning [ give up sugar quotas ] ( http://www.wykop.pl/ramka/1579595/ue-uwalnia-rynek-mleka-i-cukru/ ) .
