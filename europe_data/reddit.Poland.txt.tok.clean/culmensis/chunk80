   if you fail to see the difference , there 's no point in discussing it . 
  imho you should be responsible for your words and not run away from them . 
   that 's not what i 've said . 
   so that antisemitism has deep roots in the baltic states and poland . 
  and even today , it 's not going anywhere . 
   what for ? 
  just curious . 
  what gives you that strong feeling that poles are anti-semites . 
  can you give some of your personal experiences ? 
  do you think , that antisemitism among poles is bigger than antipolonism among jews ? 
   if it is then so are terrorist attacks . 
  please keep the proportion . 
  we are not talking about terrorist attacks in poland but incident that 3 drunk locals shouted and pushed forigners . 
  for me it 's just strange , that such an incidents are allowed to publish here when it 's happening in poland after pis government or uk after brexit . 
  imho you can find similar issues in other countries . 
  for example i have never seen information about this [ rape and murder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_maria_ladenburger ) conducted in germany in this sub .

  i have never seen any of [ rapes ] ( https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/8663/germany-migrants-rape ) conducted in germany in this sub . 
  is n't it the ` local news ' ? 
  you are welcome to poland . 
  come and see , 
  a few times i saw them working as chiromantists and frying pan sellers . 
  [ source ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/transport/facts-fundings/scoreboard/compare/investments-infrastructure/quality-roads_en ) is based on this particular data [ the global competitiveness report 2016 -- 2017 ] ( http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-index/competitiveness-rankings/#series=eosq057 ) , that has this adnotation : ** ` in your country , how is the quality ( extensiveness and condition ) of road infrastructure [ 1 = extremely poor -- among the worst in the world ; 7 = extremely good -- among the best in the world ] ' ** . 
  so it is based on survey of citizens ... 
  ancient greek or modern greek ? 
  do you have a day off ? 
  bit jealous ... 
  i was not sure . 
  in this case ( total cost ) the warsaw from the map is ok = the everage price for 25 sq m is about 1300 z\u0142 + rent 500 + electicity , water etc could be 1826 z\u0142 ( 410 euro ) . 
  but if we are talking only about price rent then it is not true - the everage is 1300 z\u0142 = = 291 euro . 
  is this a total cost ? 
  including electricity , rent , water , internet maybe ? 
   there are n't enough houses . 
  sounds like a good idea to start a bussines . 
  seriously . 
  it was supposed to be a joke mate ... 
   poland is just upper slovakia may be . 
  but [ janosik ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sv2assv_6fu/hqdefault.jpg ) was pole . 
  multiracial marriages ? 
  thank you for information . 
  could you please write which plan is it ? 
  and if it 's real unlimited , or it slows after 100gb ? 
   poland here : it 's unlimited without any provisions . 
  and it 's 5 eur instead of 15 . 
  where ? 
   it is bad for the job market in the eu , though . 
  it 's about travel visas and not employment visas . 
  congratulation ukrainians  hope it 's the first step into deeper cooperation . 
   this magnet is called peace . 
  good point . 
  there are some percentage of them and we should help them . 
  but imho we should give them shelter , food and they should be deported after war is finished . 
  without forced integration , family reunion , pocket money etc. 
   it 's why a lot of my countrymen left greece for the united states , australia and germany during the greek civil war ( 46-49 ) do n't forget [ poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeks_in_poland ) :  most self-identified greeks in poland today trace their heritage to the large number of greek citizens who fled as refugees from the greek civil war and were admitted into poland . 
  [ 3 ] they consisted largely of former partisan units from the macedonia region of greece . 
   most had been farmers before their flight from greece . 
  [ 4 ] in total , from 1949 to 1951 , 12,300 people from greece came to poland , of whom roughly one-quarter were children . 
  even if every country in eu will agree to relocation it will not stop the influx of ` refugees ' , contrary it would increase it imho . 
  we should ask the question - what is the magnet that attract people to come to eu ? 
  imho it 's a big amount of free money offered by some countries , policy of forced integration , uniting families , giving citizenship etc. 
  we should change it and make this less attractive for them . 
  what would it change for you ? 
   and just send soldiers with wings ? 
  what can we do for you - bulgarians and greeks , beside of controversial ` relocation programme ' that is no cure for this issue ? 
  should we send a soldiers , guards etc ? 
  any idea ? 
  how to push germany to not give free money for all of that people ? 
   they want to lift the quarantine that was imposed in their camps due to a scabies outbreak in the camp . 
  thank you for explanation . 
  now their behaviour is more comprehend . 
  what they want to achieve by burning their own shelters ? 
  will it help them to reach germany or other countries which give them more benefits ? 
  between rivers - it 's quite common : in polish it 's a name for few villages and cities - list of [ mi\u0119dzyrzecze ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/mi%c4%99dzyrzecze ) . 
  and most well known is famous anciet [ mesopotamia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mesopotamia ) - for people interested in etymology : meso ( between ) potamia ( aka [ potomac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potomac_river ) ) - rivers . 
  edit : or like in a [ hippopotamus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hippopotamus ) - hippo : horse , potamus : river -  river horse , 
   \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0456 i 'm afraid that it will be cold calculation and using of many excuses - such as our citizens have to excuse their goal of earning criterion . 
   a radical right-winger this argument is usually used by radical left-wingers , 
  the [ whole footage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noci15mbv2c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=23m1s ) . 
  not a brit , but i bet that act with a dead pig 's head is good example . 
  in case of poland abortion was available on demand for poles during nazi occupation from 1943 . 
  german women still was under threat of death . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_in_germany ) , [ 2 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/aborcja_w_niemczech ) . 
   slavic slaves were predominant in scandinavia . 
  even the word `` slave '' is likely derived from `` slav '' we should grow a big remorse for it for you and benefit from it , 
   looks like finland has more nordic genes than iceland ... iceland population is about 300.000 citizens . 
  imho there were fewer in earlier times . 
  in this case even one brave slav-man could do this miracle , 
  donald one ? 
   a jew is in charge now !, 
  not for the first time in modern poland . 
  [ shevah weiss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shevah_weiss ) - speaker of the israel 's knesset and israeli ambassador in poland - in his [ interview ] ( http://www.naszczas.pl/nasi-autorzy/polacy-i-zydzi-jutro-i-wczoraj ) with [ w\u0142adys\u0142aw bartoszewski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_bartoszewski ) asked :  ` what would you say to israeli people that do n't want to visit poland [ ... ] ? ', 
  bartoszewski answered :  ` please point another country european union , which in the past fifteen years , had three foreign ministers - geremek , rotfeld , meller , of jewish origin , and the fourth honorary citizen of the state of israel , minister of foreign affairs , who was in auschwitz . 
  please point a country in europe . ', 
  on the other hand we have many people of jewish origin in politics , media etc. 
  interesting fact is that wife of our current president [ andrzej duda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrzej_duda ) is of jewish origin . 
  [ she ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agata_kornhauser-duda ) is a doughter of [ julian kornhauser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julian_kornhauser ) - famous poet of jewish origin .
