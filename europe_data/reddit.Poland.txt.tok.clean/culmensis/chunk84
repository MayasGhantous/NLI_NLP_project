  all , except neutral austria , are formerly communist countries . 
   a mixture of hanseatic look at my nick - i 'm from hanseatic town too ( almost ) and i have a german heritage too . 
  and i like the south germany version of divide of germany more . 
  always [ appreciated ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfuliqnoegq ) our bulgarian brothers . 
  and here is the our try to achieve the way of of your harmony : [ michal lorenc from bandit movie ] ( https://youtu.be/_6ga4c2h4h0 ) . 
   northern germany is and will always be best germany  do you mean ddr ? 
   germans are underrepresented in the parliament , hope you know that ` the parliament ' is nothing but a place of talking . 
  without any real strength or influence in eu . 
  without the authority to make laws . 
  do you know who make laws in eu ? 
  - just a rethorical question . 
  so i would not care if you are represented in or not in ` the parliament ' -- it is not so important imho - becouse this is not a parliament that make a law for eu . 
   germany might even split up in smaller units ( something like greater saxony , rhineland and south germany or whatever ) in order to be more comparable with other federal units of europe . 
  i admit that this is still a long way to go , though :d good idea . 
  - hope your most credible and trustworthy part of todays germany will be the [ kingdom of bavaria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swldpcrhkaa ) or austria in near future , 
   jokes aside , po voters are mostly old and middle-aged people . 
  agree - they are imho mostly children of communists parents or just ideological supporters of ussr , supporters of former terror formations like ub or nkvd - all the people like to use slogans like ` young , educated from big cities ' to support their own thesis . 
  thank you for your sources , but please again --  do you know why sikorski has called our friends from lithuania ` thieves ' or ` cheats ' in this particular case ? 
   maybe what we need is a western and eastern government for a united europe ? 
  imho it 's just an idea of ' [ three seas initiative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_seas_initiative ) ' , but we are weak as the weakest link in this chain . 
  many of us would choose shvejk 's policy . 
   something to do with https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/orlen_lietuva yes - that was the subject of their conversation . 
  i agree with you that readers of newspapers have a strong opinion about individual public figures . 
  someone is better described and someone is described worse . 
  and in this particular case , do you know why sikorski has called our friends from lithuania ` thieves ' or ` cheats ' ? 
   ex polish fm called lithuanian officials ` thieves ' , ` cheats ' that is hard statement , just wonder why he had this accusations towards our friends from lithuania ? 
  i know how to set and find the baltic countries on the map - just remember their names : lithuania , latvia and estonia . 
  these are three countries alphabetically sorted from north to south : estonia , latvia , lithuania . 
   so for the moment , let 's just agree to disagree and work together on the things we all do agree on . 
  i like it - have an upvote and thank you for understanding . 
   if every single german decided to allow refugees , they 're still just 1/5th of the country . 
  as i said before - we are not a direct democration and we are not voting for such a cases . 
  so this factor is not relevant . 
   if the eu voted as a unified whole , the overall result would definitely be some sort of restrictions on refugees what kind of restriction you mean , what solution would you like to implement ? 
  on the basis of what you write there are many conditions that say that there is no country comparable to germany in the criterion of imposing their will on a federated europe . 
   plenty of other countries within the eu also have a decent amount of influence or potential with in the eu . 
  such as ? 
   but then there would n't be countries ... that 's the whole point ... 
  ultimately , yes , but do you think that after signing some of federal agreements , the entire eu area will suddenly become homogeneous ? 
  in overall i like the idea of federalised eu but if europe would federalise now , then the only country that will be able to govern the whole federalised eu is germany . 
  they will push their solutions for other parts of federalised eu . 
  if so - i do n't like this idea . 
  only uk had ability to be equal to germany and be counterweight in eu so , before brexit - maybe yes . 
  but now - not . 
  i like the current state . 
  [ girls also have access to computers . 
  - now you !, 
  - you can program .

  below uk are : latvia , slovakia , hungary , bulgaria and romania . 
  do you realize that in this collection of countries slav countries are in the minority ? 
   18 is a bit too young . 
  in this case it was < 20 factor . 
  our great - grandmas had 1-st child at < 20 , grandmas < 25 , mathers < 30 etc - like some kind of a trend . 
  the average age at which women become mothers is higher and higher . 
  i do not know if it is a measure of progress or on the contrary . 
  for some reason we die out . 
  thank you very much . 
  i do n't know why such a article are written . 
  most of poles are pro eu . 
  this wave of hate against poland would be ended when we will choose pro-german government again and stop thinking about three seas initiative imho . 
   by fulfilling the requirements and in this case it was ? 
  what it was in this particular case in your oppinion ? 
   the article covers specific cases involving stateless people , they by definition do not have a country to `` go back '' to . 
  i agree than in this case sweden should give them a citizenship / s. 
   unaccompanied child asylum seekers are being denied the right to bring their families to join them in sweden once they have been given swedish citizenship why to give away of swedish citiznenships ? 
  if they are real refugees - all they need is food and shelter while their is a war in their countries . 
  after the end of a war they will should go back to their countries and do n't need swedish citiznehsips imho . 
  not mentioning a family reunifications . 
   wan na know the `` fixation '' on the `` 6 million '' ? 
  this number is treated as [ magic one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb-glofj3ou ) imho . 
  exactly - would you fight or give up your children ? 
  which life is more important - a child , an adult or an old . 
  this is a question . 
  the question is answered in talmud imho . 
  and the head of litzmannstadt ghetto asked the rhetorical question according to jewish faith imho and then conduct according to it . 
  too bad that other jews killed him in auschwitz . 
   it 's boston what do you expect . 
  they 're more liberal then new york city i guess you probably did not see brussels or berlin . 
  this is the refuge of communists , trotskyists , hippies , greens , and other 1968 freaks who now have power . 
  i hope common sense will win . 
  it 's just a overall attitude from ` international ' newspapers . 
  current government - so hated pis - was the one that signed the lisbon treaty . 
  they ( pis ) are hated because they are more pro usa than pro germany . 
  they are trying to defend polish interest of state , rather than germany . 
  that is the sin . 
  hope we will choose pro-germany goverment in the future . 
  they will allow nordstreamii , shutdown our shipyards , sugar factories , we will just become of state described in [ mitteleuropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa ) :  the mitteleuropa plan was to achieve an economic and cultural hegemony over central europe by the german empire [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and subsequent economic and financial exploitation [ 13 ] [ 14 ] of this region combined with direct annexations , [ 13 ] settlement of german colonists , expulsion of non-germans from annexed areas , and eventual germanization of puppet states created as a buffer between germany and russia . 
  yet another anti-polish article in german newspaper . 
  one of the founder of idea of modern eu - [ richard von coudenhove-kalergi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_von_coudenhove-kalergi ) in his book : praktischer idealismus ( practical idealism ) , written in 1925 , describes the future of europe and european racial composition with the following words :  the man of the future will be of mixed race . 
  today 's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space , time , and prejudice . 
  the eurasian-negroid race of the future , similar in its appearance to the ancient egyptians , will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals . 
  [ ... ]  instead of destroying european jewry , europe , against its own will , refined and educated this people into a future leader-nation through this artificial selection process . 
  no wonder that this people , that escaped ghetto-prison , developed into a spiritual nobility of europe . 
  therefore a gracious providence provided europe with a new race of nobility by the grace of spirit . 
  this happened at the moment when europe 's feudal aristocracy became dilapidated , and thanks to jewish emancipation . 
  how is it far away from what hungarian pm is talking ? 
  in / r/europe for the first time , the society and even [ some of the self-hating poles admits that there is enough of number of links hating poland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qmppx/eu_starts_legal_action_against_poland_over_new_law/ ) . 
  it seems that after the brexit the only reasonable , reliable power of eu in the context of economy is germany . 
  it is a pity that the uk has left the eu .
