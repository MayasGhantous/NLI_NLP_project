  only they could be a counterbalance to germany . 
  france is too weak to be an equal partner to germany imho . 
  it seems that germany are trying to construct the next reich . 
  the next step for them is to build a common army and conduct a federalization . 
  and other part of eu will be pushed to be part of a mad relocation program , or pushed to be a supporter of programs like nordstream 2 . 
  it is a pity . 
  good question - they should be , but some of them are not imho . 
  some time ago occured the scandalous `` consultations '' of the president of the constitutional tribunal with parliamentarians in parliament ( [ article in polish - you can watch video ] ( http://niezalezna.pl/74305-kontakty-rzeplinskiego-z-po-normalne-i-nie-zagrazaja-niezawislosci-co-ukrywa-prezes-trybunalu ) ) . 
  answer by the constitutional tribunal :  `` ct judges are well-known people with many years of professional experience in various fields , so it is normal to have personal knowledge of ct judges with many people , including those active in the scientific , cultural and political spheres . 
  morally or religiously , to which they have the right , like all citizens , to receive ( so far ) strong guarantees to preserve their full independence '', 
   how naive can you be ? 
  imho you are living in a world build on some kind of conspiracy theories . 
   if it happened 5 years ago there would be outrage . 
  such as when police constantly made provocations during demonstrations that were not supported by goverment ? 
  is n't it just yet another case of calais jungle set on fire ? 
  who cares ? 
  let 's play !, 
   reorganization of the court system means to shift responsibilities from one court to another court . 
  it does n't mean `` to change something related to the judicial '' . 
  i 'm not sure if the definition of ` reorganization of the court ' means to shift responsibility from one court to anoter court . 
  for me it 's a little bit naive definition . 
  i 'm not a specialist in interpretation of language structures . 
  i 'm just a simple programist . 
  but in the case of poland , the proposed change in the judiciary - for example - the supreme court - consists , among other things , that today the acting chamber of the civil , criminal , labor and military courts will be liquidated and in their place will be created new civil , criminal and disciplinary chamber . 
  the disciplinary chamber is a novelty here . 
  and military court will be liquidated permanently . 
  hope it would fit to your definition of ` reorganization of the court ' . 
  what do you think ? 
  so let 's pray that the islamist newcomers in german soil would choose the liberal mosques . 
  maybe even the [ lgbt-friendly mosque ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/1.796322 ) aka ` feminist ' islam emerges to fight extremism . 
  / s sorry - could n't resist . 
  let 's just hope that they will not be extremists in any case . 
  i keep fingers for you - germans . 
  hope you will not spoil europe . 
   i 've also heard that before it , they wanted to propose a less controversial set of reforms . 
  i wonder what made them change their minds . 
  never heard - any sources ? 
  - just curious . 
  and what is interesting imho - that even in the same case , germany has [ simmilar solution wirtten in their basic law ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6pxul1/polands_kaczynski_says_sticking_to_judicial/dktb0l4/ ) :  in the event of changes in the structure of courts or in their districts , judges may be transferred to another court or removed from office , provided they retain their full salary . 
  i 'm not sure where from all the hate and fobias against this solutions proposed in poland comes from . 
  what is the reason to do that ? 
  what is the reason of the hate speach ? 
  because we do n't share the same oppinons in some cases ? 
   i 'm not an expert in polish constitutional law , but i doubt that . 
  and you doubt what exactly ? 
  i 'm not the expert too - but it seems that in both our countries we have similar solutions in case of changing the court system . 
  that is good imho - we can take from your - older and better democratical solutions ( sorry for being a little salty ) . 
  and now we are trying to change the law in the case of choosing new judges . 
  after the changes we will have solutions simillar to your solutions . 
  and now - the most important question imho - why is all of the histeria in international newspapers about changas in polish law ? 
  we just want to have solutions similarly like in germany . 
  - why so much hate against polish government ? 
   allowing politicians to swap the judges at any time is just an invitation for fraud . 
  agree - swaping judges should not be allowed ` at any time ' . 
  and it 's not - this is allowed by our constitution , when  where there has been a reorganization of the court system or changes to the boundaries of court districts , a judge may be allocated to another court or retired with maintenance of his full remuneration . 
  as i said - i do n't like the method allowing retire some of the judges by our minister . 
  hope it would be changed in the next version of this law . 
  what is your oppinion - which version is better - the one that is in force now - when judges can choose new judges by themself , or the proposition of breaking the monopoly ? 
   just not the parts about purging exiting judges . 
  i do n't like this and i hope it would be changed in the future proposal . 
  but it was in line with our [ constitution , article 180.5 ] ( http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm ) :  where there has been a reorganization of the court system or changes to the boundaries of court districts , a judge may be allocated to another court or retired with maintenance of his full remuneration . 
  their goal is to save kami\u0144ski from jail ( see how now przy\u0142\u0119bska announced they are going to rule on competence conflict against supreme court one day before supreme court will judge his abuse of wiretaping ) , and to jail whoever they please ( mostly opposition ) . 
  i heard that theory . 
  after vetoing the proposal of changes act on supreme court by our president - it will not be possible - so we can try to treat this theory like another conspiracy theory imho . 
  i 'm asking about long-term solution - is n't it the same as used in other eu countries ? 
  imho the hurry with voting at the proposal , once-time ability to retire choosen judges - that are for sure factors that are controversial and should be fix , but is n't pis goal to have similar solution like used in germany or netherland ? 
  by now , the new judges are choosed only by old judges - without any control or influence . 
  is this solutions working in different countries in eu ? 
  another artificial affair blasted off proportion .

  that is the role of the police in my opinion . 
  easy . 
  i talked about czech not your country . 
  and i did not agree with the tone of op . 
  if someone likes to find a story hidden in words , the etymology of the name of this city ( schwerin ) comes from the slavic word - zv\u011b\u0159in ( zwierzy\u0144 ) . 
  original meaning of zwierzy\u0144 or [ zwierzyniec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwierzyniec_ ( disambiguation \\ ) ) : a place of animal breeding or place where animals are hunted . 
   ceded gdansk and corridor .

  old good questions -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy2ayanpafa, 
   also , i do n't think poland 's parliament is doing so great , that citizen could just laugh to other countries . 
  is n't it this famous ` what about argument ' ? 
  if so - would you like to talk about your country and ability to ` laugh to other contries ' ? 
  [ or in 1933 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact ) :  one of the most noted of j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski 's foreign policies was his rumored proposal to france to declare war on germany after adolf hitler had come to power , in january 1933 . 
  some historians write that pi\u0142sudski may have sounded out france regarding the possibility of joint military action against germany , which had been openly rearming in violation of the versailles treaty . 
  france 's refusal might have been one of the reasons that poland signed the german -- polish non-aggression pact . 
  pilsudski died in 1935 . 
  would it be interesting to see what policy he would choose in 1939 if he would be alive in for next few years ? 
  would he give a part of land to germany ? 
  and he would coop with the axis to destroy the communists ? 
  or would he rather choose the communists to beat the nazis ? 
  or maybe as his successors - he would choose to make nothing and at the end choose the promises from france and uk ? 
  it is not the ` original ' funeral of pilsudski imho . 
  this picture is taken from the mass in [ st. hedgiw 's cathedral ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._hedwig%27s_cathedral ) in berlin to worship pi\u0142sudski . 
  from polish [ wiki about funeral of pi\u0142sudski ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/pogrzeb_j%c3%b3zefa_pi%c5%82sudskiego#reakcje_mi.c4.99dzynarodowe_na_.c5.9bmier.c4.87_j.c3.b3zefa_pi.c5.82sudskiego ) and reaction from different countries . 
  google translate for germany :  in germany news of the death of marshal pi\u0142sudski , who reached berlin just before midnight on may 12 , 1935 , made a great impression . 
  concerns began to flow from the german authorities . 
  information on the first pages was given by newspapers ( among others : v\u00f6lkischer beobachter , which reads : `` new germans tilt their flags and banners in front of the coffin of this great statesman , who first had the courage of an open and trusting agreement with the national socialist reich '' ) . 
  the german information service reported that the message deeply touched german society , which felt particularly close to polish society , especially since it lost its leader in 1934 , marshal hindenburg , the president of the reich . 
  after the death of marshal pilsudski chancellor adolf hitler announced in germany national mourning and sent a telegram with condolences to the president and government of poland . 
  he wrote in it : `` deeply touched by the news of the death of marshal pi\u0142sudski , i express my sincere expressions of condolences to the polish government and the government of the reich .
