  i agree that this may be a difference but it is a one off and the court procedure is the same as in germany . 
   they are also voted in by the parliament with 2/3 majority , not picked by a partisan minister . 
  in poland they are also voted in by the parliament with 3/5 majority , not picked by a partisan minister . 
  the difference is 2/3 vs 3/5 . 
   and lastly , there is simply a stronger democratic and nonpartisan tradition here . 
  honey is too good for a bear ? 
  because i never got an answer that would show that the proposed solution is not similar to that used in germany ? 
  if all these proposed solutions are similar to those used in german republic - why so much hatred , why so much hatred and lack of substantive arguments ? 
  strange - because pis propose laws solution is similar to germany 's law - which is imho so much respected by czechs . 
   `` sputnik news '' or famous in poland ` trybuna ludu ' durring communist times . 
  old good times . 
  i noticed that there were differences between articles in english and polish language from them . 
  the difference were crucial imho and could be considered as manipulation and just a propaganda . 
  exactly . 
  i 'm not sure who is the target of spiegel.de readers - but for sure they love dark , cheap and easy thrillers . 
  [ ah ... jo ] ( https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_rfbf2n0l1jq5x7747dbdjiqrpxkt8o2i.jpg ) . 
  i would like to understand all the issues . 
  i 'm now a lawyer and i may be wrong . 
  i just want to know what is the real difference that judge oppinions that pis is dismonting the 3-power schema . 
  as far as i know this is solution similar to that which is working in germany atm . 
  in above post you are talking about once movement in sc letting retire some of the judges . 
  and i agree that it is the difference between proposed solution ang germany law . 
  and this move can be considered controversial , but is allowed by our constitution . 
   no , because it will not be possible to become a judge without ending up on a list of possible candidates made by justice minister . 
  you mean in a judge in supreme court ? 
  can you give any sources ? 
  so the difference is that once in poland some of the judges will be retired . 
  the mechanism remains similar . 
  hard to believe imho . 
  all the previous governments had an ability to check everything about it . 
  now it works on the level of rumors . 
   so all they have to do is do exactly what pis has done and reogranize everytjing to excuse a future ideological purge , just like pis is doing . 
  i 'm not a lawyer - but you can be right - it should be probably changed . 
  but it 's changing in the constitution . 
  now pis is trying to give parliament ability to choose some of the bodies . 
  it is how it works in germany and other european countries . 
  is there any country in eu that judges are choosen by themself - without any control?ution - which is another level that we are not talking about . 
   where the hell is the compromise there ? 
  because pis dont have the 3/5 voices in sejm . 
  current judge system in poland is build that they can choose another judges from our society without any control . 
  do you know any european country that perform in such a way ? 
  ok - look at the https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ok6qb/poland_right_now/dki2bqr/?context=3, 
  hey anarchist from romania - it 's almost 03 am night , and my post was downwoted after few minutes . 
  is that you ? 
   future government does the exact thing and purges all the judges pis appointed in first of all - the context when it could be changed is described in our constitution - you can do it only when specific circimstances are met . 
   all the judges pis appointed in calm down please and do n't worry . 
  it will not work for polish parliament - they will need more voices to do that . 
  so it will be judges of compromise - not the pis one . 
   that it 's all in the name of better democracy ? 
  it 's the way how it 's work in germany ? 
  is n't it ? 
  after last changes in law about judgment system in poland - we will have similar solutions like in germany or holland . 
  is it wrong ? 
  the last changes in law about judgment system in poland - we would like to have it similar solutions like in germany or holland . 
  can we ? 
   we must have watched a different video . 
  agree . 
   people telling is it a way that you would describe ` telling ' ? 
  the whole of aggressiveness and hate reached just a crazy level imho . 
  hope you will not burnt poland mate . 
   783,085 poles in germany . 
  i am impressed by the accuracy of measuring the quantity of national minorities in germany . 
  could you give the sources ? 
  i think the goal of this article is to present negative aspects of the lives of ukrainians in poland . 
  i have friends from ukraine and they are happy with their stay in poland . 
  i also like to watch footages made by ukrainians who live in poland on youtube . 
  i have seen videos from more than 100 authors , and only once have i seen someone say negative about poland or poles . 
  the minister probably says about situation when pm janik was attacked by protesters . 
  here is the article about the issue and 2 videos . 
  the scared man is pm from pis . 
  asking for sources can be a reason for being downvoted . 
  congratulation my friend . 
  even if true it 's hard to call him as corrupt because of that . 
  have you got any sources that he is corrupt ? 
   corrupt sources ? 
  it 's news from 22.06.2017 . 
  seriously ? 
  why do you think so ? 
  i heard many statements that ` lech would not approve , agree ' etc. 
  from opposition side . 
  opposition is trying to use lech kaczynski remembrance imho . 
  his brother has the fair right to be angry about it . 
  imho . 
  you are right - i checked it and had different results - what is strange imho . 
  i read somewhere that reddit is planning to give different conetnt for different countries . 
  hope google do n't do it for such a unambiguous factors like numbers of items . 
  for me : poland - 3,420 ; bulgaria - 36,900 ; ukraine - 770 ; please check - http://imgur.com/a/nejci - strange is n't it ?
