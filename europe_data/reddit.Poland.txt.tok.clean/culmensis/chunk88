  ` collective responsibility ' is the idea that comes from your russian society for us . 
  it brings ideas like ' [ dedovshchina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dedovshchina ) ' for our army , the same scenario for prisoners or other schemas that were build hiererhical . 
  during the occupation of poland by nazi germany , the germans applied collective responsibility for poles . 
  you are the same in this factor , comerade . 
   now it 's your collective responsibility . 
  i remember that kind of accusations and way of interpreting issues . 
  i remember that kind of accusations from the period of soviet occupation in poland . 
  this kind of thinkig and understanding the world is just evil imho . 
  it is the one of the factor of ` soviet people ' that you brought to us and factor i do n't like . 
  really . 
  the ' collective responsibility ' vs ` individual responsibility ' is the method to how to make a slave the nation . 
   in my opinion graves should be respected . 
  as i said  for russian friends - we are not demolishing graves or cemeteries . 
  and it is true . 
  we respect people . 
  even they are deadh . 
   does n't allow ukrainians to do whatever they want they should just obey ? 
  old good attitude from russia . 
  hope you got it now - what smaller and weaker nations thinks about you . 
   cenotaphs a cenotaph is an empty , symbolic tomb - from wiki . 
  in this case i do n't know what we should do and what you expect from us . 
   what your government is doing is exactly pillaging graves . 
  hope not . 
  example from my town is talking something else . 
  we found corpses - we burried it in full ceremonial . 
  imho it 's hard to accuse us for desecration of the bodies . 
  if you have any information about specific location of such an issue - pleae inform polish forces , newspapers , etc. 
  seriously . 
  for russian friends - we are not demolishing graves or cemeteries . 
  for us - your ( as well as other nations from ussr empire , including poles ) role was ambigous - we very appreciate all of the young soldiers , often kids that fought and died on our soil fighting with nazi rule . 
  on the other hand these people bring for us the other totalitarian rule - communism . 
  we lost our independence and for us this period is period of lost chances , lost independance , massive terror and being puppet state of ussr . 
  for poles , simple russian soldiers sacrificed their lives fighting fascism - but at the same time they brought another occupant on their bayonets . 
  despite this , we have respect for simple soviet soldiers . 
  an example from my city : in 2012 was renovation of the main market place . 
  the bodies of 21 soviet soldiers were found . 
  they were exhumed and buried with due respect in the city cemetery . 
  in the area where other soviet soldiers were previously buried . 
  the funeral ceremony was attended by representatives of the city authorities , embassies of belarus and the russian federation and chaplains of the polish army , including the orthodox . 
   you can differently judge that time , but we come to this that they were young boys who had to fight and fall here on foreign soil and we want to commemorate them , `` explains mariusz k\u0119dzierski , mayor of chelmno . 
  here is one of articles about it in polish : http://bydgoszcz.tvp.pl/8109132/w-chelmnie-pochowano-szczatki-zolnierzy-radzieckich and this is only one of polish cities . 
  and one example of exhumating . 
  you can find information about ` soviet cementaries ' in other part of poland you can find googling ` cmentarz zolnierzy radzieckich ' term . 
  how do you think - what is the capacity of germany and at which number they will change their minds ? 
   you really have no clue what you 're talking about , huh ? 
  please pay attention , that i 'm only citing the wiki articles . 
  if you do n't agree with them , you can freely edit it . 
  please message me if you would change it . 
  [ the bpjm has drawn criticism for de facto censorship , paternalism , and restricting the freedom of speech and of the press ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_department_for_media_harmful_to_young_persons#criticism ) . 
   more people prefer cheap entertainment than political demonstrations ( and literally everything else ) . 
  there were few exceptions - like [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7xqwm_c1_k ) . 
   there is no censorship in western europe . 
  except of germany ? 
  [ one official censoring body in germany is the bundespr\u00fcfstelle f\u00fcr jugendgef\u00e4hrdende medien ( federal review board for media harmful to minors ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_germany#west_germany_.281945.e2.80.941990.29_and_re-unified_germany_.281990-present.29 ), 
   on foreign policy , pis is atlanticist and less supportive of european integration than civic platform . 
  true . 
   the party is soft eurosceptic , and opposes a federal europe . 
  you mean - because it opposes the federalisation ? 
   in its campaigns , it emphasises that the european union should ` benefit poland and not the other way around ' . 
  never heard such a statement - any sources ? 
   it is a member of the anti-federalist alliance of european conservatives and reformists i read wiki article that you use for definition and there is a definition of ` soft euroscepticism ' :  soft euroscepticism is support for the existence of , and membership of , a form of european union , but with opposition to specific eu policies ; imho it 's quite strange definition of euroscepticism . 
  first - what is the eu in this definition . 
  eu parliament , commision , etc ? 
  and - is there a party in european countries that supports ** all ** eu policies , and do n't have different views ? 
  this definition demands full obedience for eu institutions . 
  would be interesting if there would be shift in eu political views ( i hope it will be ) - so automaticaly all todays eurosceptical parties would become a pro-european parties . 
  and vice versa . 
  strange . 
   what pis without doubts is . 
  why do you think so ? 
   here please show the fragment where your statement is written . 
  and i asked for reliable source - not just a rumors from anonymous eu diplomats . 
   i ask you ... why ? 
  because this map is made from wrong data . 
  it counts for example pis in poland as antieuropean party , which is wrong imho . 
   poland [ ... ] vetoed the new european operational headquarters because it had the word `` headquarters '' in it . 
  reliable source ? 
  if some country do n't want federalisation of eu it 's hard to call them anti-european imho . 
  for poland this data is wrong . 
  from the [ source ] ( http://www.electograph.com/p/electomonitor.html#poland ) for poland there are parties : razem , sld , . n , po , psl , pis , k15 and korwin . 
  and only korwin party is eurosceptic and it has about 2-4 % of support . 
  i do n't know why pis is considered as antieuropean party . 
  it was kaczynski for exmple , who signed the lisbon treaty . 
  hope that not agreeing with oppinion of some eu institutions does n't make them eurosceptic . 
  from this it appears that the german economy began to exploit fossil sources in 1992 . 
  a little inadequate sources perhaps ? 
  if marcon is going to work really hard , maybe we will take france to a [ three seas initiative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_seas_initiative ) , who knows ? 
  they would first have to sort out the mess in calais and let drivers carrying goods from other countries - just to work . 
   but no one , either here , or on the cover as far as i know complained about free speech , they complain about the separation of powers that is getting broken down . 
  why do you focus on free speech ? 
  how is it relevant in this topic ? 
  because i remember hysterical attacks on poland in 2016 , when the hated party got power as a result of democratic elections . 
  when all those who lost their mind talked about censoring and attacking the ` free media ' . 
  when people from different countries were sealing their lips in defense of the free polish media . 
  and now i see that the media in poland can publish opinions that are not consistent with the opinions of the government ? 
   how is this about free speech ? 
  in poland you may use any cover that is not illegal . 
  in poland you can say anything that is not illegal . 
  * illegal in the meaning of denaying holocaust or being pro-socialist movement like nazi or communism .
