  publish their names . 
  seize all their grain from them . 
   designate hostages in accordance with yesterday 's telegram . 
  do it in such a fashion that for hundreds of kilometres around the people might see , tremble , know , shout : `` they are strangling , and will strangle to death , the bloodsucking kulaks '' . 
   telegraph receipt and implementation . 
   find some truly hard people '' why some of you worhship this man ? 
  is this a really big stockholm syndrome ? 
   ussr created before him sorry , but i beg to differ . 
  for me ussr was responsible for terror , killling inocent people , implementing delusional ideas such as kolhoz , with all the consequences , etc. 
  it was responsible from the beggining - from lenin times . 
  there were also good things during that period such as industrialisation , schools for everybody , etc. 
  but the same effect could be achieved without all the bloody ideologies imho . 
  communists killed so many russians - why do you still worship it ? 
   it is a tabloid magazine . 
  i 'm not sure what is the definition of ` tabloid ' you use . 
  imho it is not . 
  it could be considered as controversioal imho , but not as a tabloid . 
  anyway - this article was written by professor of university of warsaw - [ bogus\u0142aw wolniewicz ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogus%c5%82aw_wolniewicz ) - please try to find weak parts in his article - try not to attack the place where it was published . 
  i 'm trying to talk about facts . 
  if i see numbers in ` sciences works ' that are taken from nowhere - then sorry - i will try to find where from are they taken . 
  if you would like to talk about facts - it would be appreciated . 
  just lower the amount of goods such as pocket money , social grants , free housing , family reunion , granting citizenships etc. 
  it is the real magnet that attract these people . 
  and reason why they are risking their and their children lives . 
  if the conditions in europe for them would be not better than in turkey - the stream would be stopped imho . 
   sorry , but the typo `` pubic relations '' made me giggle when i read the rest of the reply . 
   xd i 'm not sure if there are freudian mistakes allowed with such a low level of knowledge of a foreign language - but i corrected it - thanks , 
  please write what do you mean :  i do n't trust ` high time ' magazine from poland as a reliable historic source on jewish deaths during ww2 . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  what magazine ? 
   what does n't sit well with me is that poland has a history of shaming and discrediting , without contrary evidence , it 's own historians who ask hard questions about polish responsibility for what happened during ww2 . 
  i am very explicit in my wording . 
  this subreddit would never afford me the luxury of being that dishonest . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
   nothing as iconic as merkel with her wardrobe and that thing she does with her hands . 
  body language and gestures are used in pub ** l ** ic relations . 
  a very famous way to hold hands is `` turret '' or `` rhombus '' . 
  in this position of the hands , it is about showing self-confidence , high self-esteem and equally high competence . 
  `` turret '' is very , very popular gesture . 
  particularly among politicians . 
  in merkel 's case , the same gesture has its own definition : the [ merkel-raute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merkel-raute ) . 
  in the polish language there is the expression ` to step in a shit ' , which means to be unlucky . 
  on the portal fronda.pl was published review of grabowski 's book , in which the author used the sentence :  and let 's be careful of mr. grabowski and his book so that by accident do n't step in ... it . 
  grabowski felt offended and went to the court . 
  he won that talking about his book per ` shit ' can make him as an author feel offended . 
  however , consider that this was not a court judgment on the veracity of his thesis contained in the book . 
  the author of the article you quoted did not give the context and is in my opinion unreliable . 
  i would like to order our discussion : in my post i showed that number of 200,000 is unreliable . 
  from what i understand , you accuse poles as a nation for cooperation with germany ? 
  if we talk about a small percentage , then i will agree . 
  if we talk about a nation ( i do not know what a good criterion of assigment ) - i will not agree . 
   is your hostility towards any type of discussion regarding the subject . 
  where did you see it ? 
  i 'm just trying to talk about facts . 
   what i do believe is there were polish opportunists who also saw a chance to perpetrate violence against those who they deemed to be their enemies . 
  agree there is some opportunists in every population . 
   third paragraph 45,000 . 
  it 's about 1950 and not 1944-45 . 
  and is quite different from other [ sources ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_poland#numbers_of_jews_in_poland_since_1920 ) : 1945 - 100,000 ; 1946 - 260,000 ; 1951 - 70,000 ;, 
  vlad fought the ottoman empire . 
  the ottoman empire used [ impaling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impalement#ottoman_empire ) as a form of punishment . 
  vlad was kept at the sultan 's court as a prisoner when he was a kid . 
  for him this way of killing people was probably normal . 
  vlad defended his land and his people . 
  the fighting broke out when he refused the sultan to pay tribute and sent 500 boys into slavery . 
   poland had 3 million jewish inhabitants before ww2 , that was reduced to 45,000 . 
  it is so disingenuous to claim that only a minority of poles helped the nazi 's . 
  are poles worried that people will acknowledge your suffering less if you admit you were complicit in the suffering of others ? 
  i 'm not sure where from did you get this 45,000 ? 
  in the article it was 35,000 :  `` one can start by saying that about 35,000 polish jews survived the war in poland ( excluding those who fled into the soviet union and returned after the war ) . 
  and please pay attention that for the whole jewish population it was a bigger number . 
   it is so disingenuous to claim that only a minority of poles helped the nazi 's . 
  do you think that majority of poles helped nazis ? 
  any prove for that claims ? 
  i will not respond to the other claims now . 
   as a ukrainian you should not play the jewish card imho in this case . 
  it 's not good to write about how old is a woman - but she is younger . 
   god , the youtube comments . 
  your post inspired me and i found that one :  lol lol he loves older persons , 
  but he is very important , is n't ? 
  and the previous position was offensive to this man , 
  vlad fought the ottoman empire . 
  the ottoman empire used [ impaling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impalement#ottoman_empire ) as a form of punishment . 
  vlad was kept at the sultan 's court as a prisoner when he was a kid . 
  for him this way of killing people was probably normal . 
  vlad defended his land and his people . 
  the fighting broke out when he refused the sultan to pay tribute and sent 500 boys into slavery . 
  i think he is underestimated . 
  jewish authors give different numbers of jews murdered by poles . 
  for example , \u015apiewak gives 120,000 , gross initially 200,000 then withdraws from it to tens of thousands . 
  today grabowski gives 200,000 . 
  the number of victims is unknown . 
  it is estimated - based on the assumption that 10 % of the jews escaped from the gettos - but this is only a guess and estimate - there is no evidence of how much has escaped . 
  it might as well be 1 % . 
  however , there were poles who risked their lives and their families ' lives . 
  would you do that ? 
  it seems that extremist movements in germany are beginning to slip out of control . 
  it has also recently been reported that speaking on the internet contrary to the undefined political correctnes will be punishable by horendal punishment . 
  where are the germans heading ? 
  you may need to restore an action like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denazification ) ?
