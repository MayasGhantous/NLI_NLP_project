   what an unconventional way of putting it . 
  agree - it 's trange . 
  normally , the word nazis is used to describe the germans in 1939 . 
  i have been there many years ago ( at village leninskiye near novosibirsk ) . 
  quite nice and interesting city . 
  at summer it was over 40 degrees . 
  and a lot of small , biting flies . 
   goverment that pathologically campaigns against the eu examples ? 
   that guy is either lying or misinformed , pis has n't had over 40 % support for months now . 
  that is not true . 
   looks like orban and pis needs to up their anti-brussels rhetoric . 
  not agreeing with some brussels decisions is not anti-eu sentiment imho . 
  nice . 
  made from flowers i suppose ? 
  this lady has the name of the hero of rzeczpospolita - kosciusko . 
  hero of poland , belarus , ukraine and lithuania . 
  the highest peak in australia is called by his name . 
  he participated in the war for us independence . 
  i hope that the descendants of kosciuszko grandfather stand on the right side today . 
   a priest is preaching through loudspeakers outside that catholicism is persecuted in poland really ? 
  what exactly did he said ? 
   if replacement migration continues , and the european demographic continues to shrink , europe will look radically different in the future . 
  we already see stark changes in many neighborhoods . 
  in 50-100-200 years ? 
  imho it 's just sad that people asking this question could be considered as nazis and fascists . 
  imho - you are just brave that you dared to ask this question . 
   our imho / u/kotwworku was talking about eu / s. 
  we all know that all countries are equal but some countries are more equal than others . 
   nevertheless this was n't the point i was trying to make . 
  i know for a fact that there are plenty of lovely and hard-working poles . 
  did you read the source you gave , darling ? 
  please indicate where there are data that prove the thesis :  2 % more than any other immigrant population . 
   yeah ... sure ... fabulous integration . 
  according to the uk prison statistics 9 % off inmates are from poland . 
  2 % more than any other immigrant population . 
  it 's a bit far fetched to say every polish dude has assimilated to the culture . 
  sources ? 
  and please consider the amount of poles in uk . 
   anti-eu agenda not agreeing in forced , ineffective solutions is not anti-eu agenda imho . 
   our political and civic culture is much bigger than the one in poland . 
  so out of curiosity - how well do you know the polish political scene ? 
  can you give some examples that the dutch civil and political culture is at a much bigger than in poland ? 
  there are moderators of niche / r/polska trying to present this sub as modern and multicultural , and to attract other bushmen . 
  source : https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/20170412_eleventh_report_on_relocation_and_resettlement_annex_3_en.pdf data used to create the map : | country | % of legal commitment effectively relocated | | : -- | : -- | austria | 0 % | | belgium | 13 % | | bulgaria | 2 % | | croatia | 2 % | | cyprus | 20 % | | czech republic | 0 % | | estonia | 30 % | | finland | 64 % | | france | 16 % | | germany | 13 % | | hungary | 0 % | | ireland | 64 % | | latvia | 56 % | | lithuania | 35 % | | luxembourg | 50 % | | malta | 85 % | | netherlands | 28 % | | poland | 0 % | | portugal | 42 % | | romania | 14 % | | slovakia | 2 % | | slovenia | 29 % | | spain | 10 % | | sweden | 1 % |, 
   i thought there is no treaty at the moment and all this fuss is about starting that treaty ? 
  from article , hope it 's the reason , and we will punish about it , not about a future treaty :  poland and hungary have refused to take in a single person under a plan agreed in 2015 to relocate 160,000 asylum-seekers from italy and greece , which had been overwhelmed by mass influx of people from the middle east and africa . 
  nice manipulation  the structure of your statement is as follows : 1 . 
  i want to say ` your thesis follows here ' . 
  2 . but it would result in discussion how germany is sucking ... 3 . 
  so it is better not discusse it . 
  you just shut up the ability to response , 
  there are only two countries in eu that fulfill their obligation . 
  do you know which ones ? 
   such letters mark the first step in the so-called infringement procedures that the commission can open against eu states for failing to meet their legal obligations . 
  the next step is to write a statement on the sidewalk with a chalk . 
  are they profitable ? 
  go to a hanza city in germany - maybe it would help ? 
   lying about his id when questioned ... 
  seriously ? 
  i have not heard .

  thanks . 
  april 10 , 2010 the president of poland and more than 90 vips from all political parties died in airplane accident . 
  every month there is a march of people who want to mourn their death . 
  there are environments in poland that want to interfere with it . 
  they are trying their best to break the peaceful march . 
  this aggressive older gentleman from [ the movie , that attacks the cop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr8nuzbgisq ) is frasyniuk mentioned in the article .

   in poland there is pretty big chance of being beaten on the street by adidas comrades any statistics for poland and the rest of eu countries ? 
  can czech labor offices direct unemployed people for such a work ? 
  and whether the refusal threatens to lose benefits ? 
  would it be higher than the first ? 
  i think you 're wrong . 
  could be worth to picture the data in per capita criterion . 
   http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/06/25/comment-the-popes-climate-encyclical-is-not-anti-polish-it-is-the-opposite/ i cant see the picture in this article . 
  ok - thank you for your time . 
  do you like this rhetorics ? 
  :  polish one ( president ) looks like a pedo as usual ? 
   i would respond , but i 'm not sure if you 're serious or not . 
  please respond . 
   fyi `` as usual '' translates directly to `` jak zwykle '' that is exactly what i mean . 
   which is something completely different from what you think he actually has said . 
  really ? 
  tell me what did i really mean ? 
  for me it is sad . 
  it is sad that young people like / u/mistrzmasarski use the language of hatred . 
  they use terms to humiliate people . 
  they use terms that are related to sexuality to induce feelings of hatred . 
  the same methods have been used in the past . 
  methods to hate and dehumanize specific groups of people in different criteria : race , social ladder , ways of earning money , expressing feelings of love . 
  i hope that future generations of poles will be resistant to such rhetoric . 
   polish one looks like a pedo as usual ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) as usual ? 
  if you look like a pedo , it does n't mean that all poles look like that . 
  imho . 
  i feel strongly self-esteemed that the romanians are satisfied with the sales results in poland . 
  greetings .
