  [ amount of money countries paid to or received from the eu per capita . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4n51be/amount_of_money_countries_paid_to_or_received ), 
   but i like it more when there is only the couple of poland and hungary . 
  we do n't want to ruin your intimate relationship . 
  i know that it 's more easier to be considered with and use features like : conformism , premeditation , cleverness , calculating , sophistication , opportunism , cowardice , submissiveness , selfishness , self interest , particularism , privateness , than sincerity and loyalty . 
  but despite of it - really congratulation for your final attitude . 
   more like `` eastern europe absolutely does not understand treaties '' . 
  which ones ? 
   i would like some translated sources , not from google translate ... ( plz do not take offence ) it was just a list of centres for foreigners in poland . 
  i do n't take your questions as offensive . 
  easy - i know that we should not trust google translate  if you do n't like a google translate and you do n't know polish , then - [ it 's the same webpage in english language ] ( https://udsc.gov.pl/en/uchodzcy-2/pomoc-socjalna/osrodki-dla-cudzoziemcow/mapka-osrodkow ) . 
  the english version was made by webadmins of this polish government webpage . 
  hope you will like it . 
  and you will aprove it finaly . 
  please use google translate - it works well imho from some weeks when they introduced new algorithms . 
   it looks like it will not last long until eu membership will get more negative sides over positive ones . 
  the end of the eu as we know it is closer than we have thought it was . 
  agree . 
  but how to stop freak countries that giving away free money , free housing , easy family reunification and citizenship . 
  countries that broke the law to picture themselfs as a more ` human ' now . 
  that is the magnet that attract all of these poor people from all over the world to come to some countries in eu . 
  the magnet that people risk their and their family lives . 
  imho it 's just selfish behaviour of countries that need to be whitewashed . 
   so , how many cie do you have in poland ? 
  i mean , you host frontex too ... is it some kind of competition ? 
  what have we won ? 
   poland promised , but nothing happened . 
  why are you lying ? 
  thank you czechs . 
  hope poland and hungary will not be the only scapegoats from now . 
  not bad . 
  it seems that the whole region will achieve a good growth in 2017 . 
  yea for sure . 
  it seems that friends like you should be kept at front . 
  from the beggining of cooperation . 
   well the deluge was shit , but also our key to nordics :p it seems that it was difficult and insincere friendship from the very beginning . 
   asia minor was greek you mean alexander of macedon ? 
   what 's the attraction to china in poland ? 
  everyone has their own story and their own experiences . 
  i like them , for example , because every chinese i correspond with wants to be my friend . 
  probably most of these auto-suggestions comes from this one article : \u6b27\u6d32\u7684\u57ab\u811a\u5e03 -- \u6ce2\u5170 \uff0c \u4e3a\u4f55\u662f\u8d85\u7ea7\u53cd\u534e\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6 ? 
  thank you for information . 
  so , where were they when former gov did broke the law ? 
  for me it 's just an hypocrisy . 
  how old is that information ? 
  could you give source ? 
  i 'm asking because  why does poland hate china ? 
  was reported some years ago . 
  and for sure it 's not true . 
  it was caused because articles about poland is very little in chinese internet . 
  in one of them author used this phrase . 
  this article was cited some times and now it 's ( hope it was ) used as a suggestion about poland . 
  the remedy is to write some article how poles like chinese in chinese language , 
  eu institutions support tusk more than pis - that 's for sure . 
  good news !, 
  as i wrote above :  the whole mess was started by the old government - they choosed few more judges for the court . 
  to have ` independend ' judges that support old gov. 
  i did not vote them . 
  i 'm rather a loyalist and i support democraticaly elected powers . 
  i support some of their move and some i dont . 
   if you think i hate poland you are wrong i did not think so . 
  i think you have a small amount of information about poland and you relay on slogans and biased publications . 
   ( you suggest i 'm russian because russia and poland dont really like each other no ? ), 
  because if you are autside of eu than it 's worth to explain imho . 
  thank you god for our pis government !, 
  good news !, 
  unfortunately not . 
   most of the sanskrit numbers are actually pronounced with the exact same root , not just similar . 
  and according to this ' [ genealogy tree ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/indoeuropeantree.svg ) ' the sanskrit is not an ancestor for our languages . 
  this language is just an old aunt and not a direct ancestor . 
  the real one is proto-indo-european language . 
  i was trying to guess where are you from - and u r from russia , do n't you ? 
  you are right about priciples . 
  there should be clear separation of powers . 
  the whole mess was started by the old government - they choosed few more judges for the court . 
  to have ` independend ' judges that support old gov. 
  todays gov have to clean the mess created by the old gov. 
  the gov that was leed by tusk - our 1/2 president of eu ( the other 1/2 in always drunk juncker ) - both were choosen democraticaly - as you know / s. 
   well fuck me sideways . 
  what are most important words for people ? 
  describing relatives like son , daughter ( pay attention how it sounds in russian ) , man , woman , and - numbers . 
  the numbers for me is excellent indicator of being the descendant of proto-indo-european heritage . 
  when i was in london last time we were discussing if welsh language is from proto-indo-european . 
  we just checked the welsh numerals : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_numerals . 
  sound the same ? 
  yes . 
  check irish - http://www.omniglot.com/language/numbers/irish.htm - the same . 
  we are all from the same source ... - european relatives ? 
   it works the same way you get 20 years of jail for murder and 3 years for assault . 
  agree . 
  we should distinguish between punisment for different cases . 
  but imho more important is the inevitability of the punishment than the hight of it . 
  and in this case germany and france avoided punisment and now they are trying to punish countries that not obey other laws . 
  for me the law is more important . 
  and countries that are ruling eu - like germany ( sorry - not france ) should obey the law more orthodoxelly . 
  citizen of ancient roma understanded that well more than 2000 years ago when they had they own empire - ` caesar 's wife must be above suspicion ' which degenerate to todays germany attitude : ` we have the money , we make the rules ' - we are above any law - because we have money . 
   actual leader of poland spit on it 's just an example of emotional rhetoric imho . 
  who is the leader ? 
  what exactly ` the leader ' did ? 
  - please be more specific .
