   the separation of power . 
  ` the leader ' did it ? 
  - how ? 
  what are you trying to say ? 
   first one : separation of power between justice , law and executive ( and media )  the actual leader of poland want to destroy this one and eu give a blame to poland because of this please be more specific . 
  i do n't understand you - sorry . 
   poland and some other far right country in eu spit on basic rules of democraty and you place this at the same level than a economic rules ... 
  please be more specific than emotional . 
  please do not use stereotypes and prejudices . 
  if you have something smart to say - write it now and here , please . 
  so one law is more important then another ? 
  and breaking the 1st law is less evil than obeying the 2nd law ? 
  how that works according to you ? 
   what poland and hungary leader do with basic rules of democraty . 
  please provide the definition of democraty - how do you understand the term , then please provide examples of not obeying the rule by poland in this criterion . 
  thank you . 
   some crimes are more serious than others , so some crimes get more punishment . 
  please describe more specifically the individual cases of violation of law listed in this thread : poland , germany and france . 
  all these countries were accused of breaking the law . 
  write - which countries have broken ` more ' laws than others . 
  what crimes are more serious than others . 
  please write what criterion you used . 
   wow . 
  i ca n't believe that did n't piss off all the other eu nations . 
  exactly . 
  how would you call that mentality ? 
   was poland penalized for rejecting the refugee quota they agreed on ? 
  changing the subject ? 
  do not you want to answer questions and continue interesting discussions ? 
  such method and rhetoric is called ' [ and you are lunching negroes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) ' . 
  but ok - let 's change the subject . 
  i am not a lawyer , but the acceptance of ` refugees ' was a commitment adopted by the previous government . 
  failure to do so is not a breach of any law but breach of contract . 
  i do not know what the case looks like today , but there have been various penalties for poland for refusing to accept ` refugees ' . 
  for example , according to the newspaper la stampa , the european commission will penalize countries that do not want to accept ` refugees ' of 250,000 euros for each . 
  do not you think it 's funny ? 
   see my edit . 
  yea - you are right - potential penalties for non-compliance are less severe for the rich . 
  this is just a truism . 
  from what i know , not the height of the penalty but its inevitability is important . 
  was germany or france ever penalized for their non-compliance of law ? 
  if you know such cases - then write . 
  if they were not , and now they scary others using argument about consequences of not obeying the law - i think it is hypocrisy . 
  hope you agree that everyone should be treated equally in criterion of obeying the law ? 
  are you ? 
   was n't that you point that everyone should be treated equally ? 
  in criterion of obeying the law ? 
  yes i think so . 
   we could . 
  i 'm quite confident france and germany would manage with fund cuts . 
  not so sure about poland . 
  are you sure that you answered the correct message ? 
   especially when one is a net contributor and the other a net receiver . 
  in my opinion , the law is the law . 
  and should be followed by everyone . 
  without any exceptions . 
  whether one is rich or poor , old or young , beautiful or ugly . 
  according to me , that is the law . 
  and such arguments in my opinion is not even hypocrisy . 
  thanks for kind words . 
  i like this subject from a while . 
  if you like it too , you can find this interesting : the [ proto indo european dictionary online ] ( https://indo-european.info/dictionary-translator ) - i do n't know how it 's reliable but it 's interesting ( for me  to look for similiarities . 
  numbers for example : oinos , dwou , trija , etc. 
  sounds interesting . 
  have you any sources for that ? 
   i can now see why it is called the mother of all modern languages . 
  imho it should be called sister . 
  the mother is the [ proto-indo-european language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-indo-european_language ) . 
  here is the ' [ genealogy tree ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/indoeuropeantree.svg ) ' - you can see that slavic languages comes directly from pie language . 
  all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others . 
  [ polish numbers from 0 to 20 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c32vhzakc0q ) if you want to compare . 
  from [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanskrit ) :  sanskrit ( iast : sa\u1e43sk\u1e5btam ; devanagari : \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u092e\u094d ; ipa : [ s\u0259\u0303skr\u0329t\u032a\u0259m ] [ a ] ) is the primary liturgical language of hinduism ; a philosophical language of hinduism , buddhism , and jainism ; and a literary language and lingua franca of ancient and medieval south asia . 
  [ 6 ] as a result of transmission of hindu and buddhist culture to southeast asia and parts of central asia , it was also a language of high culture in some of these regions during the early-medieval era . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] sanskrit is a standardised dialect of old indo-aryan , having originated in the 2nd millennium bce as vedic sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to proto-indo-iranian and proto-indo-european . 
  [ 9 ] as one of the oldest indo-european languages for which substantial written documentation exists , sanskrit holds a prominent position in indo-european studies . 
  some politicians oppose the federation of europe and support the construction of europe as a union of nation states . 
  this opinion has been expressed since at least 2006 ( i have found such [ sources ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/europa/kaczynscy-atakuja-spoleczenstwo-obywatelskie,45129,1,1.html ) ) and probably much earlier . 
  these people were in power in 2005/7 and now from 2015 . 
  i do n't care . 
  you can choose whoever you want . 
  you were the only real power that had a chance to change the current eu . 
  you escaped and left us alone . 
   even with the million ukrainians ? 
  :d not only . 
  i know people from for example moldova that are working in poland . 
  it 's part of the romania , is n't it ? 
   yeah but only true polish christians can build houses . 
  great joke / s. 
  so if only true polish christians can build houses , then who can blow them up ? 
   and with 2004 , poland was given new industrial jobs . 
  you have shitty jobs that made you die earlier , that made you live in poorer conditions etc. 
   is the purpose of the polish society to have industry jobs or is the purpose of the polish society to live better ? 
   you can put communism again and have 100 % industry jobs like these ones . 
   that 's up to you . 
   sorry but what you wrote is just a bunch of nonsense , rhetorical questions , truisms and stereotypes . 
   competition with western companies has led to a massive industrial decline in eastern europe . 
   i 'll write it in bold . 
  wth are you talking about ? 
  i 'm talking about 90 and free market . 
  we opened our market for western companies without any restrictions .
