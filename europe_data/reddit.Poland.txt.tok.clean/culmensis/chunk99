  our factories were sold to western ones . 
  this step has led to a massive industrial decline - almost every third factory was liquidated or ceased its industrial production for distribution and unemployment jumped from 0 in 1989 to 16,4 % in 1993 . 
  in which part do n't you agree with ? 
   industrialization for the sake of industrialization makes no sense if you ask me . 
  i can agree with you that productivity and efficiency are more important than industrialisation . 
  the ` industrialisation ' was just a part of my message . 
  a part that some users do n't agree with and forgetting the rest of my post . 
   so industrial jobs went from ee to we ? 
  that 's bullshit and you know it very well . 
  industrialisation is the process that transforms a human group from an agrarian society into an industrial one , involving the extensive re-organisation of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing . 
  productivity describes various measures of the efficiency of production . 
  hope we agree that during changes in poland in 90 ' the industrialisation decreased ( it 's what i 'm writing about ) , while productivity rised ( it 's what you are writing - i hope ) . 
  hope this helps . 
  if you have any other questions please feel free to ask . 
   tl ; dr we call all agree that your initial comment   competition with western companies has led to a massive industrial decline in eastern europe . 
   is bullshit . 
  i have the impression that you are mistaken two concepts : [ industrialization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrialisation ) and [ productivity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/productivity ) . 
  it is not the same . 
   claiming that ee had a massive decline in industry is ridiculous . 
  do n't get greedy . 
  imho there is a difference between buying the license and being bought . 
  imho we can find some factors that could support your pow . 
  such as asembling the cars . 
  but you can also take into account indicators like proportion of people employed in industry . 
  in this criterion it was 5.2 million of poles in 1980 and 2.8 million in 2013 . 
  let 's not forget that after 1989 almost every third factory built in communist times was liquidated or ceased its industrial production for distribution . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6eexx8/eu_proposes_time_limits_on_cheaper_foreign/diabp9w/ so , imho we can call that process as ` decline ' . 
  some of researchers call that changes as ` deindustralisation ' of poland . 
   i highly doubt that . 
  maybe in term of local company , but you attracted a shit tons of ours . 
  some of researchers call that changes as ` deindustralisation ' :  the main area of karpi\u0144ski 's research is analyzing the transformations that took place in the polish industry . 
  he is the co-author of a unique statement , `` how were created and how did the industrial plants in poland fall ? '' . 
  according to his findings it follows that in the new market conditions after 1989 almost every third factory built in the people 's republic of poland was either liquidated at all , or had ceased its industrial production for distribution ( trade , storage , etc. ) . 
  but not even in the number of fallen bets . 
  karpinski explains that for the economists still the best measure of industrialization is the proportion of people employed in industry . 
  it is not an ideal measure , but it captures not only pure production ( changing through severe business fluctuations ) or the value of assets ( often difficult to estimate ) but also the role that industry plays in the real economy . 
  and just looking at this indicator , it is best to trace the fate of polish deindustrialization . 
  the peak of employment in industry was in our country in 1980 . 
  around 5.2 million poles worked there . 
  in 2013 it was only 2.8 million . 
  `` this means that in poland after 1989 there was the greatest decline in employment in industry in the whole of post-war europe . 
  the comparable recession in this period only the united kingdom , '' - karpi\u0144ski points out . 
  and although the 1990s were not the only record in terms of the number of closed or closed plants , it is still a key factor . 
  it was then the polish economy entered the path of deindustrialisation . 
  i support of the changes - but it 's worth to know the other sources too . 
  imho so works the free market . 
  our companies were sold to western companies , our market was opened for western bussineses . 
  competition with western companies has led to a massive industrial decline in eastern europe . 
  what we can compete with is the service sector and cheap labor . 
  i hope this will be even soon and our salaries will rise to the western level . 
   more like russian . 
  absolutely not true . 
  one of the communism goal was to create society without nocionalistic feelings . 
  one of the method to achieve that , was [ forced deportations of nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union#ethnic_operations ) and mixing them in other places . 
  russian nationality has nothing to do with that imho . 
   . . why ? 
  to me , the reason for this was that these people conveyed the history and culture of the past generations of their nation and hindered the construction of a modern , multicultural , communist society . 
   its mostly because of the things like the catholic religious fundementalism rearing its head in poland and just how crazy , backward and regressive the polish government seems . 
  ( and i know a nation 's government and its people are two seperate entitys , but presumably a lot of poles share the governments views as they voted for them ? 
  etc ) . 
  but thats why i think so . 
  thank you for your response . 
  imho these arguments are on a high level of generality . 
  these are just stereotypes . 
  could you be please more specific and give some examples ? 
   there 're still some sorbs around yeah : [ example of their language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph5mushtgs0 ) , their [ national anthem `` beautiful lusatia '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ubajiomvdk ) . 
  respect for them that they were able to preserve their own language and customs for so long . 
  the boundaries of individual states have been shifting in over time . 
  individual countries and nations choose periods in which their countries are the largest , hes biggest influence etc. 
  and that justifies their demands for the land . 
  i hope this is just history and demanding lands because of history will not happen again . 
  my intention is not to demand recognition of the slavic nature of eastern germany . 
  [ poland maps ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbo%c5%82u%c5%bcyczanie#/media/file:polska_992_-_1025.png ) at that time . 
  sometime it 's hard to guess why they are leaders imho . 
  an old joke about it : a man goes into a pet shop to buy a parrot . 
  the shop owner points to three identical looking parrots on a perch and says : `` the parrot on the left costs $ 500 '' . 
  `` why does the parrot cost so much ? '', 
  asks the man . 
  the owner says , `` well the parrot knows how to use a computer '' . 
  the man then asks about the next parrot , to be told that this one costs $ 1,000 because it can do everything the other parrot can do plus it knows how to use the unix operating system . 
  naturally , the increasingly startled man asks about the third parrot to be told that it costs $ 2,000 . 
  needless to say , this begs the question `` what can it do ? 
  '' , to which the owner replies , `` to be honest , i have never seen it do a thing , but the other two call him boss !, 
   chill in the sense that you never hear about any nujob crazyness coming from there ( in comparison to say poland ) . 
  imho , my duty is to ask - why do you think so ? 
  any examples ? 
  ( and i 'm asking him - not all the polish nutjobs from this sub - so please calm down  ), 
   now there are 3 million pro neo-ottoman ` soldiers ' in germany alone . 
  not sure about the exact number of ` soldiers ' in germany - but u r right imho . 
  it was/is fight between christian/pagan europe and islam . 
  spanish vs islam [ reconquista ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista ) viii - xv century . 
  [ byzantine empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_empire ) vs islam from v - xv century , greeks , bulgarian , romanian , moladavian , yugoslavian ( sorry - have no time to check ) , hungarian , ukrainian , slovakian , poland and probably more countries vs islam . 
  now imho is the next stage of the same war . 
  the same war that is conduct from mahommed ( vi century ) time . 
  it 's just an [ ambivalence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambivalence ) . 
   r/latvianjokes now it 's funny / s. 
   explains your hate towards politburo . 
  not sure if i got that ... 
  there are warmer seas in your area that are our prime goal  .
