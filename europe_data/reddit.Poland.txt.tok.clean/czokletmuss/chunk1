the independentist parties have a total result of 47 % so majority of catalans do n't want independence ? 
  why are we even discussing this than ? 
  personally i hope that - if the independence is declared - all secessionist leaders will be arrested and put on fair trial for flagrant violation of spanish constitution . 
  ** unilateral ** declaration of independence is a crime . 
  edit : article 155 of spanish constitution clearly states :  article 155  1 . 
  ** if a self-governing community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws , or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of spain , the government ** , after having lodged a complaint with the president of the self governing community and failed to receive satisfaction therefore , ** may ** , following approval granted by the overall majority of the senate , ** take all measures necessary to compel the community to meet said obligations , or to protect the above mentioned general interest . 
  with a view to implementing the measures provided for in the foregoing paragraph , the government may issue instructions to all the authorities of the self governing communities . 
  unilateral secession of comunidad autonoma de catalunya would be `` acting in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of spain '' , so the officials who would commit such an act would be basically commiting high treason . 
  if it comes to this i think secession would be bad for both spain and separatists - i ca n't image any nato country ( which spain is member of ) or eu country ( which spain is member of ) or any country dealing with separatism or any country willing to do business with spain recognizing catalunya . 
  spain could put separatist government under great political and economical pressure , not to mention that spain has an army if it comes to the worst case scenario . 
  nationalism is not an answer to any problems . 
  should is secede when c. 55 % is for secession but 45 % against ? 
  is this really in accordance with the will of the people ? 
  should the 45 % minority be allowed to in turn secede from catalunya and join spain or form their own country ? 
  this is a very nuanced issue and ultimately it 's about legitimacy of state and its laws . 
  the will of the people is a fuzzy concept , i personally tend to prefer more legalistic approach . 
  it is partially responsible but what is the alternative ? 
  to give all ccaa possiblity to secede legally so that in the future basque country could secede and then galicia and andalusia and so on ? 
  it 's just not a viable option for any country , especially countries so varied and with such history as spain . 
  now of course it can be discussed whether `` spain '' as a concept is more important than right to self-determination but it 's hard to expect from people who swore an oath to protect constitution and territorial integrity of the country to allow secession . 
  nationalistic-driven separatism once out of the bottle would be very hard to contain . 
  it 's their business , i 'm just sharing my opinion on internet forum created to share opinions , so i do n't get what your problem is . 
  yeah right , madrid = literally hitler etc. 
  i would n't blame madrid really - if they would allow secession this would set a precedent which could lead to the dissolution of the state . 
  they would break the law ( constitution inter alia ) by agreeing for something like this , so it 's not like they really had a choice . 
  i do n't know how familiar you are with spanish history but position of madrid is completely understandable . 
  true . 
  however we 're a not talking about individual case ( s ) of civil disobedience but of secession which could potentially lead to collapse of the kingdom of spain , so the stakes are much higher for both parties . 
  i 'm not a citizen of spain so it 's not like my opinion matters that much but personally i think that this would be damaging to both spain and catalunya . 
  good to see you  as for the discussed issue - yes , if they want to declare independence they may do this only unilaterally but it will still be a crime . 
  have the spanish constitution changed in this regard ? 
  than i see no connection . 
  thank you for your service ( and contribution to discussion ) o7, 
   so any country that exists in the world was build by criminals ? 
  how states come to be is much more nuanced issue than that . 
   borders change , just read some history man , and laws ca n't stop that . 
  i know `` some history man '' and i have n't said a word about how possible is the secession to happen . 
  i just stated the obvious - what the separatists want to do is a crime as per spanish law . 
  do n't expect much from the dutch , i assume that avarage dutch citizen knows close to nothing about ukraine . 
  i 'm not talkig of what * ought * to be but what * is * the law . 
  meneth ? 
  * that * meneth from paradoxplaza ? 
  damn the reddit is a small place . 
  if the independence is declared i hope all secessionist leaders will be arrested and put on trial for flagrant violation of spanish constitution .

  unilateral secession of comunidad autonoma de catalunya would be `` acting in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of spain '' , so i do n't see how someone can say that this would be legal . 
  every country which imports food is doomed to fail when the climate change and environmental degradation plus growing demand from 9,000 mln people make it impossible to feed population . 
  btw if you think egypt is the worst case scenario [ than you should read about saudi arabia . 
  ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/9/14/9323379/saudi-arabia-squandered-its-groundwater-and-agriculture-collapsed ), 
  oh my , is it semana santa already ? 
  very interesting , thanks for the link !, 
  yeah , there will be pis majority government most probably . 
  it 's not about immigrants , it 's about how eu is making decisions . 
   straight north !, 
  so ... sweden ? 
  well yeah except it 's the president who chooses pm and `` gives him a mission to create cabinet '' , so there will be no coalition with po in it . 
  if you want your promises to be treated seriously you do n't break them the day after you made them . 
  that 's the main problem with how this thing was dealt with by our government . 
  the difference is that he is the president and she is still a candidate saying these things during elections - i would rather have duda and szyd\u0142o as pm issuing a joint statement in november and taking real steps in order to resolve the issue . 
  i meant damage to polish reputation after backstabbing other v4 countries . 
  so who 's going to earn money taxed by government and spent on grandparents ' pensions than ? 
  it depends on the result of the elections and which parties will have how many sabres in the sejm . 
  right now pis is expected to get c. 30 % votes , so a coalition is a must - the questions is with whom ? 
  right now it 's impossible to tell . 
  i feel sorry for russians ( it 's not really their fault ) but on the other hand i * am * polish and these news are bad for russia , so ... 
   instead they have become a white alcoholic saudi arabia that ressembles more and more like idiocracy . 
   such a waste , it makes my blood boil . 
  well , what did you expect from russia ? 
  the damage is already done . 
  i guess new pm could say that we wo n't accept immigrants and we will have to pay the fine but it 's hard to tell . 
  personally i did n't expect much from our current cabinet but what they did was indeed betrayal of v4 . 
  quick translation : during eu summit in brussels on tuesday poland accepted decision concerning immigrant quota , while czech republic , slovakia , hungary and romania voted against and finland abstained . 
  according to secretary of state in ministry of foreign affairs rafa\u0142 trzaskowski c. 7 thousands immigrants will be relocated to poland . 
  in opnion on beata szyd\u0142o , candidate of pis ( law & justice ) for pm , this was a mistake . 
  ** - the decision made during eu summit is scandalous . 
  it was made against safety and without approval of poles . 
  it means that those quotes enforced on national states become a precedent and in the future may lead to ( ... ) national states being told to accept more groups of peoples without any consultation ** - she said . 
  beata szyd\u0142o remarked that immigrants will be trying to invite their families , which - in her opinion - will lead to the real number of immigrants who will come to poland to be much higher . 
  ** in opinion of ms szyd\u0142o the most scandalous is however the fact that `` polish government betrayed countries of visegrad group '' . 
  ** - on monday there were declarations that ( the government ) will protect the principle of voluntary participation in accepting immigrants . 
  on tuesday this principle was discarded - she said . 
  in opinion of ms szyd\u0142o by agreeing to quotas poland disrupted process of creating solidarity in the region . 
  - foreign policy must be pursued bravely . 
  one must create alliances and seeks agreemnts . 
  but the basic principle in foreign policy remains the interest of citizens and security of our homeland - she said . 
  pis candidate for pm also promised that if her party wons the parliamentary elections in october the security of poles will always be a guiding principle ( for her ) . 
  **** also for our baguette friends here 's version in french i found : http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1505/monde/article/detail/2464974/2015/09/23/une-decision-prise-sans-l-accord-des-polonais.dhtml, 
  damn party poopers . 
  is this the new dank ? 
  i 've never seen them before . 
  jewminati , no doubt about that . 
   i agree on pretty much everything the right wing says and now i see a dictator as the good guy . 
   german flair * sigh * goddamit , not again ... 
  i know . 
  it 's more of a pretext though , not a unique historical even of great importance ( like say 1776 or 1569 ) on which identity of a nation is based . 
  it 's not exclusive , that 's what i 'm trying to say , so it 's not like other nations joining v4 is out of the question . 
  ayyyy,
