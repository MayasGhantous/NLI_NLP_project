  i 'm talking about * public perception * , not the historical truth . 
  this is a very short post on reddit , not a * polish perception of western and eastern europe cultural division and its social and cultural consequences * monograph . 
  b-but i like turkey ... 
  yeah and we kinda hate them for making us as backward as russia was . 
  it 's no accident that russian part of poland after partitions was terribly lagging in industrialisation and urbanisation . 
  well , to be precise there are just what , 5 countries which are in [ western * western * europe ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_europe#/media/file:cia_western-europe-map2.png ), 
  it 's mostly due to the fact that we culturally reject everything connected to eastern europe - btw the term itself became common only after cold war began . 
  warsaw pact , comecon , communistic regime , all of that was imposed on us by the soviets . 
  so when we hear `` eastern europe '' we think about the decades we spent as a puppet of ussr , hence the outrage . 
  `` central europe '' on the other hand emphasises our rejection of all this and historically close ties to germany . 
  plus from a purely geographical point of view poland * is * [ in the central europe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ), 
   `` the differences between putin 's russia and stalin 's time are just one . 
  there are not mass political repressions . 
  the victims of the gulag camps were millions . 
  now the number of political arrests are just a few hundred , '' he says , his voice filled with the anger of someone who has spent decades issuing warnings that few have heeded . 
   `` but the nature of this state has n't changed one bit . '' sometimes i really pity the russians - they have to live in russia after all . 
   poland  eastern europe goddamit ... 
  i 'm not talking about me personally but i agree , it 's irrational and emotional response after being sold to ussr by allied traitors ! 11 ahem . 
  yeah i guess so - nato , eu , immigration , erasmus , participation in iraq and afghanistan invasions . 
  from polish perspective we always were part of the west as * antemurale christianitatis * , shielding christendom from turks and tatars . 
  of course this was not exactly true since there was orthodox muscowy to the east but ( 1 ) we have latin alphabet , they do n't ( 2 ) we had true catholic faith ( tm ) and they had orthodox heresy ( 3 ) together with lithuanians we had a grand nation founded on principles tolerance , freedom , diversity and republican ideas of rome , when muscovites were slaves and serfs to their autoritarian ruler . 
  we always looked to the west , to rome , paris and other important cultural centers . 
  at least that 's what vast majority of people get out of history classes in school . 
  that 's typical polish drama . 
  after being cut off from the west - which we identify ourselves as a part of - for 50 years by the iron curtain there is still the inferiority complex towards the westerners ; just like we have superiority complex towards the `` ruscy '' ( more or less polish equivalent to * russkies * ) , that is russians , ukrainians and byelorussians , because how on earth could the rabble of eastern barbarians conquer * us * ? 
  in 10 or so years i expect this to disappear completely . 
  the generation born after 1989 has no such inferiority complex whatsoever , it 's mosty the older people who had to live in the eastern block suffering from poverty and humiliation . 
  hell , the first time my dad was in a western country ( norway , 1990 ) he spent like 3 hours in a supermarket because he could n't believe how many goods there were . 
  nowadays , with everyone using english and with access to the internet , we see ourselves more on par with the west , so the drama should cease to be a problem sometime in the future . 
  ** tl ; dr ** - from polish pov we were always part of the west but after ww2 the west allowed soviets to occupy us for 50 years , hence the superiority/inferiority complex mix, 
  i reserve the right to be a bitch as longs as i want to because muh freedoms . 
  you do n't seem to graps the fact that they can be very quickly ( in a matter of days or weeks ) armed . 
  i do n't feel comfortable with this fact . 
  your opinion on what i should feel , well , to quote rhett : frankly i do n't give a damn . 
  what 's your point ? 
  [ iskanders can carry nuclear warheads and in case of conflict with nato they can be used to glass warsaw in 15 minutes , that 's all i care about  ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-placing-state-of-the-art-missiles-in-kaliningrad-2015-3 )  the iskander missiles will be sent to the kaliningrad region that borders nato members poland and lithuania as part of the maneuvers , said a defense ministry official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to comment publicly . 
   the official also said russia will deploy long-range , nuclear-capable tu-22m3 bombers to crimea , the black sea peninsula that russia annexed from ukraine a year ago . 
   in a statement , the defense ministry said the baltic fleet , the southern military district and the airborne forces have been brought to the highest stage of combat readiness and have started moving to shooting ranges as part of the drills . 
   the wide-ranging exercise started monday , when president vladimir putin ordered the northern fleet and other military forces on combat alert as part of the exercise in the arctic . 
  other units in the pacific region , southern siberia and southwestern russia also launched drills . 
   the iskander missiles deployment to kaliningrad reflects moscow 's readiness to raise the ante in response to nato moves to deploy forces closer to russia 's borders . 
  the missiles , which are capable of hitting enemy targets up to 500 kilometers ( 310 miles away ) with high precision , can be equipped with a nuclear or a conventional warhead . 
  from kaliningrad , they could reach several nato member states . 
  yes , i completely agree . 
  i just wanted to point out that we already have a border with russia with significant russian military presence not so far away from our capital . 
  on visas , not permanently settled here . 
  ** [ ca n't escape the bomb . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ab-ojlq5rwo ) **, 
   iskanders are nuclear capable , but not necessarily nuclear missiles for some reason that does n't change my feelings about the fact that they could reach warsaw in few minutes . 
   the international reaction would be much sharper , especially if russian troops would stand at the polish border . 
  we already have a border with russia in kaliningrad oblast and they have troops and rockets with nukes stationed there . 
  btw since i live in warsaw if the ww3 ever happens i would have like 10 minutes before the warheads hit the city . 
  but yes , if the russians steamroll over whole ukraine and get to the polish-ukrainian border things could get nasty very easily . 
  that 's interesting . 
  but because this was due to the collapse of the empire created by russians who conquered and forced into submission neighboring countries i can hardly feel sympathethic . 
  i know 90s was a dark period for an avarage joe but you can only blame yourself/your government . 
  this was the best part !, 
  the less russians there are the better !, 
  / s seriously though , what millions of deaths are you talking about ? 
  do you mean war in chechenya ? 
   23 fascinating diagrams reveal how to negotiate with people around the world or rather `` questionable justification of 23 national stereotypes '' . 
   you forgot silesians . 
  you mean germanized poles / polonized germans ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  germans did n't live in the east , though we also had lithuanian and byelarussian minorities . 
  and yes , we did steal vilnius from you - a terrible mistake in my opinion . 
   polish minority in lithuania is truly annoying , what did i do ; _ ;  polish people in poland however are fine . 
  oh , all right then . 
  yes but they were removed after the war - our borders were moved to the west ( 1 ) because stalin wanted everything east of curzon line ( 2 ) as a compensation for loss of territory in the east and the war . 
  and it 's not like it was up to poles , [ it was decided by stalin , churchill and truman during potsdam conference . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potsdam_conference#poland ), 
  largest minority ? 
  that would be germans , whole ** 147,000 ** of them . 
  we had several millions of jews and ukrainians once but ... 
  lol, 
   polish president andrzej duda has criticised nato for treating poland like a `` buffer zone '' rather than a fully fledged member facing a resurgent russia and urged the alliance to place permanent bases in the former soviet bloc country . 
   in an interview with the financial times , mr duda , a conservative elected in may , said nato was failing to implement its stated policies and had not adapted its strategy on its eastern border following russia 's `` imperialist actions '' in ukraine and georgia . 
   ** `` we do not want to be the buffer zone . 
  we want to be the real eastern flank of the alliance , '' said mr duda . 
  `` today , when we look at the dispersion of bases . 
  then the borderline is germany . 
  **  `` nato has not yet taken note of the shift . 
  of poland from the east to the west , '' he added . 
  `` nato is supposed to be here to protect the alliance . 
  ** if poland and other central european countries constitute the real flank of nato , then it seems natural to me , a logical conclusion , that bases should be placed in those countries . '' **  warsaw will host the alliance 's biennial summit next year , and mr duda has said discussions over permanent bases in eastern europe would be a central issue , despite german concerns that such a move would provoke moscow . 
   until last year , nato had only one small military base east of the former iron curtain , at szczecin in poland . 
  there are plans to double it in size and create a network of `` force integration units '' across eastern europe . 
  but there are still no nato fighting troops deployed east of germany . 
   mr duda , a 43-year-old lawyer and former member of the european parliament , stunned poland 's political establishment when he defeated the country 's incumbent centre-right president . 
  his victory underlined widespread public discontent despite surging economic growth that has fuelled the rebound of his right-wing law and justice party . 
  it also creates a potentially awkward cohabitation with poland 's centre-right government . 
  the president is the head of the military and foreign policy and can propose and veto legislation . 
  well , he 's right ( although i may be biased because i voted for him ) . 
  if anything happens the nato soldiers should be close to the front , that is in poland and baltics instead of ramstein . 
   what good russians , russia has done for you , your country , the world ? 
  well , the collapse of soviet union is a big plus , so thanks for perestroika and glasnost mr gorbachev . 
  ... and that 's about it i guess if we 're talking about poland . 
  as for the world -  russian accomplishments in rocket science , sputnik , gagarin as first man in space , leonov as first man literally in space , space exploration etc.
