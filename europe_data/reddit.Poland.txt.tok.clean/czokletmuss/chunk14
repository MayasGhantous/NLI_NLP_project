  there is no immigration to discuss , citizen . 
  calais is not a real place . 
  now let 's post something in glorious french instead of using this dirty english all the time !, 
  this is a good decision and frankly the only logicial consequense of not recognizing crimea as a part of russia after the invasion of ukraine . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about , do you ? 
  in poland the catholic church used to be a huge landowner too but during the communism it was expropriated and nowadays has only a small fraction of lands it used to own , though there is a fund which pays the compensation for the expropriation . 
  how is this situation perceived in greece in light of the current crisis ? 
  are there any political plans to further tax the church or expropriate to allevate the economical burden of the reforms ? 
   you pretty much have to baptize your kid to get them into school and from the church 's point of view the kid is now a catholic and must learn for communion and confirmation . 
  that sounds unjust and unfair . 
  is n't such situation de facto violation of human rights to educate your own children ? 
  in any case i wish you good luck with changing this - alliance of the altar and the ~ ~ throne ~ ~ parliament is rarely a positive thing for either of them . 
  more on this topic and in english here : http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/10/uk-europe-migrants-poland-idukkcn0pj2nr20150710 and here : http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/215853,poland-prepares-mission-to-process-refugees personally i have no problem with that . 
  while on university i was learning arabic for almost 2 years and my teacher was a syrian ( though he was atheist i think ) who came to poland in 1980s . 
  i remember he told us once about how the nativity is celebrated in syria , what with the lights and feasts and dancing etc. 
  he was born in aleppo and it 's kinda heartbreaking to see photos of the city my teacher was born in depicting a sea of rubble . 
  ** [ the effect this war has on the population is devastating . 
  ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03228/syrialights_3228898a.gif ) **, 
   there is a tradition of openly agnostic presidents and prime-ministers . 
  this comes from the 19th century political tradition , mostly . 
  this is particularly interesting , could you expand ? 
  when this tradition began ? 
  under which circumstances did it form in 19th century ? 
  sweden ca n't into relevance . 
   you know , ask some random romanian guy if he believes in god , the resurrection , heaven , hell probably 90 % will say yes . 
  ask them what they think about things like premarital sex and that 's where the fun starts , you will have a hard time not laughing at all the excuses they come up with . 
  yeah , that 's exactly how it works in poland except people do n't really have any excuses , they just do n't seem to notice the problem between allegedly following the church teachings and engaging in stuff which is considered sinful or immoral . 
   plus this addition to constitution saying that or nation was influenced by christian ideas ( not wrong , but why is this nneeded in constitution ? ), 
  this is one of the things in which polish constitution surprisingly excells , that is balancing traditionally christian ideas with modern secular ideas . 
  from [ the preamble  ( http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm )  having regard for the existence and future of our homeland ,  which recovered , in 1989 , the possibility of a sovereign and democratic determination of its fate ,  we , the polish nation - all citizens of the republic ,  ** both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , **  ** as well as those not sharing such faith but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources , **  equal in rights and obligations towards the common good - poland ,  beholden to our ancestors for their labours , their struggle for independence achieved at great sacrifice , for our culture rooted in the christian heritage of the nation ** and in universal human values , **  recalling the best traditions of the first and the second republic ,  obliged to bequeath to future generations all that is valuable from our over one thousand years ' heritage ,  bound in community with our compatriots dispersed throughout the world ,  aware of the need for cooperation with all countries for the good of the human family ,  mindful of the bitter experiences of the times when fundamental freedoms and human rights were violated in our homeland ,  desiring to guarantee the rights of the citizens for all time , and to ensure diligence and efficiency in the work of public bodies ,  recognizing our responsibility ** before god or our own consciences , **  hereby establish this constitution of the republic of poland as the basic law for the state , based on respect for freedom and justice , cooperation between the public powers , social dialogue as well as on the principle of subsidiarity in the strengthening the powers of citizens and their communities . 
   we call upon all those who will apply this constitution for the good of the third republic to do so paying respect to the inherent dignity of the person , his or her right to freedom , the obligation of solidarity with others , and respect for these principles as the unshakeable foundation of the republic of poland . 
   i 'm sorry for going into history to answer this question , but it 's a matter of national identity . 
  you have nothing to be sorry about , this was very interesting read , 
  so where are you from ? 
  because certainly [ not from usa ] ( http://www.kltv.com/story/29721876/judge-sentences-east-texas-man-to-get-married-or-face-jail-time ) . 
  well we 're pals now , right ? 
  right ? 
   however , when those laws were passed by the socialists , the conservatives have never reverted them once they could really ? 
  i thought partido popular woudl gladly reverse some of the reforms introduced by psoe . 
   the two new parties ( one in the left , the other in the right political spectrum ) have n't talked much about the church . 
  i guess the left one is podemos , but what is the second one ? 
  i ca n't really envision a `` eu army '' in which greeks and turks fight alongside to be honest . 
  wow , you have crationists in the government ? 
  this is ... surprising really . 
  compared to denmark polish state seems to be almost atheistic . 
  thanks for sharing this , it 's very interesting . 
  yeah , i can imagine why . 
   they get to teach religious education in school . 
  yeah , we have that too . 
  thanks for writing , this was very interesting !, 
  this is absurd and i seriously doubt anyone in poland would want that . 
  this policy was a spectacular failure in 20s and 30s and it 's even more improbable to work today . 
  btw is this something people in ukraine fear ? 
  poland invading western ukraine ? 
  if mr duda wants to create a central-eastern european block of countries who will lobby in eu and nato for more spending on defense and more decisive policies against russian expansion , i 'm all in . 
  oops , my bad - corrected . 
  with eastern ukraine is being liberated as we speak it would be good to show our liberators some `` gratitude '' , do n't you think ? 
  that 's very interesting . 
  what 's the public opinion on church possessing factories ? 
  is the church influence visible in the parliament apart the committees ? 
  what about protestantism and islam ? 
   i 've never ever heard some politician talk about religion during an election because people here could not care less . 
  that 's really interesting to hear because in poland religion - and church-related topics are very frequently discussed by politicians . 
  about time !, 
  if europe is ever going to be able to protect its interests without american help , we need strong german , french , british , spanish , italian and polish armies . 
  russians , obviously . 
  read about their `` liberation '' of poland and fate of german women in 1944-1945 . 
   they also have a seat in the national censorship authority . 
  church has a seat in `` national censorship authority '' ? 
  could you expand on this please ? 
  in putin 's russia lenin makes selfie with you !, 
  ** looks like ~ ~ meat 's ~ ~ tears are back on the menu , boys !, 
  nothing changes in the east . 
   what do you call a sofa , then ? 
  sofa . 
  hahaha oh wait , you are serious ? 
  ** hahahahahaha **, 
   `` it really tied the room together . '', 
  it turns out it was translated as `` ten dywan naprawd\u0119 robi\u0142 mi pok\u00f3j . '', 
  which is n't a bad translation but does n't have the * je ne sais pas * of the original . 
   guy that is not very old , not extremely religious , knows languages , finished decent school and has success in life as a business owner , writer , doctor , lawyer etc and does not milked public sector whole his life that 's pretty much duda : not very old - check not extremely religious - check knows languages - english and german , check decent school and success in life ( ... ) lawyer - phd in law , mp of ep , official in kaczynski 's kprp does not milked public sector - what does it even mean ? 
  does all officials or public sector employees ( inter alia doctors you mentioned earlier ) automatically considered not worthy of being elected ? 
   slav removal specialists that would be germans . 
  fair enough but he has more powers than that and he does n't need parliament 's support to use all of them . 
  silly crumpet , she was n't squatting - she was spreading slavic pheromones !, 
  soon thousands young slavs shall rush to your shores and before the end of the decade we shall rule the polish isles !, 
  vetoeing a bill or directing it to the constitutional tribunal is not that much of a power ? 
  i do n't know whether you are joking or not . 
  well obviously they are , that 's what democracy is about !, 
  i agree . 
  it 's getting worryingly similiar to republicans vs democrats divide in the us , what with ridiculing duda even before he took the office or did anything or shitty black pr campaign during elections ( `` andrzej duda was wyduda '' and making jokes about his daughter ) . 
  at least the next 3 months are going to be entertaining . 
  yeah but [ the bill was introduced by mps from civic platform ] ( http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm7.nsf/przebiegproc.xsp?nr=3660 ) , so i do n't really get how bill passed yesterday and effect it had on the market can be attributed to president who took office today . 
  and yet some journalists blame him :d, 
  yes it is very funny . 
  old guard born in the 50-70s ' ca n't believe that the younger generation may be just fed up with the current state of affairs . 
  and duda 's victory in elections was in part due to his presence in the internet : twitter , youtube , hell even [ today there is a live feed with the presdeint on facebook scheduled ] ( http://www.spidersweb.pl/2015/08/live-for-facebook-mentions-andrzej-duda.html ) . 
  he also has a young daughter and had direct contact with young people during his academic years as a phd . 
  and on the other hand we have people who are shocked that `` public opinion '' does n't follow what they say in tv and newspapers when they claim that everything is fine and dandy . 
  what 's ironic is that candidate of pis - conservative party based on rural electorate and eager to use semi-social slogans - seems to be the most modern politician there is right now , while po ( associated with modernisation in progress ) is now associated mostly with corruption and ineptitude .
