  and i 've to admit , duda as a new face for pis is probably the best that could happen to this party . 
  affect like [ the bill passed by the current sejm concerning help to frankowicze ( debtors who take loans in swiss franc ) ? 
  what duda can do we will learn only after the elections when the new cabinet forms . 
  she 's from poland after all ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  err what ? 
   official acts of the president shall require , for their validity , the signature of the prime minister ( ... ) the provisions of para . 
  2 above shall ** not relate ** to ... all of the above are his prerogatives which he can execute on his own . 
  nominating the president of the national bank of poland or first president of the supreme court is `` not much '' according to you ? 
  [ it 's happening !,

  let 's hope he does n't either .

  29 ) issuing orders in accordance with the principles specified in article 93 ; 30 ) resigning from the office of president of the republic . 
  that 's , like , your opinion , man . 
  * conservative andrzej duda was ceremonially sworn in on thursday as poland 's new president , bringing political change to the top office in this east european nation . 
  * * in his first speech as president , duda , 43 , promised to pay attention to the needs of the underprivileged . 
  * *** as supreme commander of poland 's armed forces , he said he was especially concerned about the nation 's security in the face of a resurgent russia . 
  *** *** `` we need a greater presence of nato in this part of europe , '' duda said . 
  *** *** he vowed to press for more nato security guarantees at next year 's nato summit in warsaw . 
  he called his program newport plus , in reference to a summit in wales last year that decided on a rapid reaction force in the region , which is still being formed . 
  duda insists that is not enough . 
  *** * within the european union , he vowed to make a `` correction '' and speak with more authority on poland 's goals and needs , in order to make them clearer to political partners . 
  * * a former member of the opposition law and justice party , he appealed for mutual respect and cooperation . 
  he will have to find ways to work alongside the liberal coalition government of civic platform and a small farmer party . 
  * * duda was sworn in before the national assembly of lawmakers and senators at the parliament building , in the presence of the government and of his predecessor , bronislaw komorowski . 
  duda 's wife , agata , was standing by his side . 
  his parents and daughter were also present . 
  * * duda 's electoral victory in may over komorowski was a surprise , and a warning to the ruling coalition that it may lose power in october general elections . 
  horribly ugly . 
  [ yeah .

  almost as many poles died during the deluge as during the ww2, 
  he 's like pewdiepie of popular history . 
  heresy . 
  holy shit , for a moment i thought this accent was faked on purpose to get laughs o_o, 
  absolutely not !, 
  how am i supposed to steal jobs in uk if they leave the eu ? 
  during time of troubles ? 
  or before muscowy sacked novgorod ? 
  sure we did . 
  granted , there were more pressing concerns and nobody baack in 14th-15th century expected muscowy to amount to anything which could rival regional powers but yeah , it theoretically was possible . 
  i do n't know about rape and pillage , but we were pretty good at opressing ruthenian peasants !, 
  til, 
   as really , lietuva ? 
  really ? 
  proud of poland ? 
  hmm , kinda . 
  historically and geopolitically poles faced many challenges , some of them overcame , some of them not . 
  it 's a tough question , impossible to give a short answer for . 
  also the better question should be `` do you feel like a patriot ? '', 
  because proud should be reserved for something ** you ** achieved . 
  being randomly born somewhere does n't entitle you to claim that the last 1000 years ( 100 years for muricans ) was something which can be credited to you . 
  ** i only wish we destroyed muscowy when we had the chance . 
  ** we could 've spared the world so much misery . 
  it 's hard to call three partitions which took place during c. 50 years a moment imho . 
  how about we reconquer belarus together ? 
  you can keep it , just give us one of dem lithuanian kings to rule over poland and together we will be unstoppable !, 
   the proudest moment in polish history i agree , it was ** the dumbest ** moment in polish history if anything . 
  yeah , this is bollocks . 
  and nobody thinks of the former territory of the glorious rzeczpospolita as `` colonies '' . 
  this map was clearly made by some yankee . 
  good for him this happened in poland - if he did this in usa the policemen would shoot him dead because `` fear for my life '' and all this bullshit . 
  though he is n't black , so maybe they would n't have . 
  probably a repost but hey , with recent development in georgia i think it 's still relevant . 
  how dare you , pesky baltic people , show such ingratitude to mother russia ? 
  [ do n't you know russians brought civilisation to your backward countries ?

  damn \u015al\u0105zaki , they ruined \u015al\u0105sk !, 
  til, 
  sejm , not sejmas !, 
  another proof of the superiority of polan & ~ ~ subjects ~ ~ friends !, 
  well duh . 
  this is europe not usa , you do n't have to be black or brown to be considered a part of a minority . 
  before ww2 we had 35 % of population as minorities ( jews , ukrainians , germans etc. ) . 
  after being playground for stalin and hitler for over a decade however ... 
  and ccaa for `` comunidades autonomas '' !, 
  meh , it 's just one of the standard pre-election promises . 
  it sounds good but i seriously doubt prawo i sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 ( law and justice ) will have the will and capability to enact something like this , even assuming they win the elections . 
  well , `` sz '' is pronounced more or less like `` sh '' in `` shut up ! '', 
  but i do n't really know how to explain `` dz '' :d, 
  dem slav phonetics * fistbump *, 
   your old friends , poland , czech , romania and most importantly ukraine you mean enslaved puppets of the su ? 
  wtf this post is in french ? 
  these are not the official results mind you . 
  but yeah , it seems you are surrounded by po fans . 
  what specialisation ( kierunek studi\u00f3w ) btw ? 
   i genuinely would love to see stats for that [ here you go .

  we 'll see about that - you may be right but afaik so far he did n't give anyone any reason to accuse him of being right-wing nutjob in contrst to mrs paw\u0142owicz . 
  [ in fact , left-wing-ish `` polityka '' nominated him as a mp of the year . 
  ] ( http://niezalezna.pl/uploads/zdjecie2015/66749952061430908656.jpg ) you can read about it [ here on their website . 
  ] ( http://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/kraj/1556381,1,ranking-poslow-polityki-rozstrzygniety.read ) he signed many but which stands out among them ( for me at least ) is renewable energy act : http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm7.nsf/przebiegproc.xsp?nr=2604 which is imho utter garbage he should refuse to sign because - not to delve into details - many provisions of this act are very badly written and sometimes even outright contradictory . 
  government failed to deliver a decent bill despite having c. 4 years to do so and instead provided us with legislative pile of crap - which , i 'm sure of it , is going to be changed several times before it can work . 
  if you are really interested in technical details let me know .
