  i 'm a lawyer and i do n't care what media say about president . 
  i care which bills he 's going to sign and which will be vetoed by him . 
  komorowski was a spineless goof of a president who signed a lot of shitty laws because his party told him to do so . 
  how can president fulfill his role of a `` guardian of constitution '' if he 's from the party which controls sejm , senate and cabinet ? 
  duda is a doctor of law and expert in administrative law in particular . 
  he will not turn a blind eye to unconstitutional bills presented to him and he will not fail to control what pm and his cabinet does . 
  as a president , he 's guaranteed to remain in office for 5 years , so politically he 's completely independent from pis and kaczynski since yesterday . 
  of course he may turn out to be a phony president , i acknowledge this . 
  but komorowski 's reelection would virtually guarantee this - mr duda gives hope that it will not happen . 
  i 'm urban , liberal and not-so-stupid and yet i voted for duda . 
  stereotypes much ? 
  in case anyone is actually interested what polish president can do :  ** the president has the right to initiate the legislative process . 
  he also has the opportunity to directly influence it by using his veto to stop a bill ; ** however , his veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of members of the sejm ( 230 ) . 
  ** before signing a bill into law , the president can also ask the constitutional tribunal to verify its compliance with the constitution , ** which in practice bears a decisive influence on the legislative process . 
   in his role as supreme representative of the polish state , ** the president has power to ratify and revoke international agreements , nominates and recalls ambassadors ** , and formally accepts the accreditations of representatives of other states . 
  the president also makes decisions on award of highest academic titles , as well as state distinctions and orders . 
  in addition , he has the right of clemency , viz . 
  he can dismiss final court verdicts ( in practice , the president consults such decisions with the minister of justice ) . 
   ** the president is also the supreme commander of the armed forces ** ; he appoints the chief of the general staff and the commanders of all of the service branches ; in wartime he nominates the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and can order a general mobilization . 
  the president performs his duties with the help of the following offices : the chancellery of the president , the office of national security , and the body of advisors to the president . 
  so he ca n't do that much on his own but his powers ( veto ) are an important part of polish check and balances system so to speak and thus he can greatly influence the cabinet in its policies . 
  i 'm from warsaw , i 'm 26 yo and i voted for duda like majority of young people did . 
  i hope he 's going to be a good president , though i 'm certain that he will be better than mr komorowski - after all , it 's not that hard . 
  i 'm also glad to that it was the first time elections in poland were influenced so much by the new media ( fb , twitter etc. ), 
  it 's about time for the new generation to step in . 
  ** dibs on poland in the next campaign !, 
  his holiness the glorious bishop of rome shall attend as well . 
  ** #makecatholicismgreatagain ** also the anthem : https://youtu.be/pqedqqywjim, 
  sounds good . 
  as for the maps i wo n't have access to my pc until friday ( i 'm writing from my phone ) , so this has to wait i 'm afraid . 
  perhaps we should advertise campaign , attendance is dropping pretty quickly imho . 
  i am alive ? 
  and ai defeated tunis and conquered some useless desert ? 
  this is most unexpected !, 
  pls gib map / u/dakarans or at least some screenshot , i 'm curious how the world looks like now . 
  also how many players attended ? 
  / u/dakarans : i will not be able to attend this weekend so please confirm that you acknowledged this - i do n't want to find out that i lost my papal states when i 'm back , 
  i want trump to win because muricans deserve him . 
  there , i said it . 
  thanks !, 
  my glorious overlord , will the spreadsheet be posted today ? 
  papacy has risen again !, 
  deus probably vult !, 
  ** burn the heretic * . 
  kill the french . 
  purge the savoyard ... ** ^ * certain ^ exemptions ^ may ^ apply ... or at least die trying ; _ ;, 
  but let bygones be bygones , we must cooperate to make sure that sardinia is crushed once and for all - i want my cores back and you will surely be interested in getting more development and good old fashioned revenge , 
   germany intervened in italy and significantly dismantled sardinia-piedmont , resulting in venice regaining all cores and you getting 3 provinces back , in addition to liberating switzerland . 
  nice !, 
   after germany annulled all of frances alliances france allied you and sardinia started supporting independence of one of your colonies . 
  this led to the french occupation of savoy when your colony declared . 
  unfortunately ai ottomans declared on france and you honored the cta . 
  you are not the wargoal , and ai ottomans will likely take nothing . 
  france defending me from sardinia ? 
  lol , what a mess . 
   finally , germany is once again occupying sardinia , with the intention of liberating the remaining imperial holdings . 
  sardinia has no allies and i encourage you and venice to assert yourselves at this juncture . 
  liberating imperial holdings * and * returning papal provinces to their rightful owner , i presume ? 
  in any case , the time has come - rome * will * be liberated from sardinian opression . 
  ** it 's time to renew alliance with venice and reach out to german empress . 
  top kek . 
  i must rejoin next week !, 
  also here are the pretty maps : ** [ political map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qzkfqt0.png ) ** ** [ religious map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jhofxrg.png ) ** ** [ development map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ak0yyhk.png ) ** ** [ technology level map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ylhqtbz.png ) ** ** [ unholy german empire map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/usfgb1i.png ) **, 
  will do but first i have a question - have i survived ? 
  :p edit : wait , i 'm at war with ottomans ? 
  and usa ? 
  and venice abandoned me ? 
  and i 'm allied to frogs ? 
  what the fuck happened . 
  i need some recap pls . 
  pope here . 
  we could try to , err , forget all this canossa business and join the glorious empire too , right ? 
  ** i wo n't be able to play today ** so if anyone wants to ~ ~ survive ~ ~ lead glorious papal states to glory you can try on one condition - the alliance with venice must continue . 
  if you are interested please pm me . 
  remove baguette from premises, 
  ** announcement ** handsome athletic ~ ~ his holliness the pope ~ ~ christian with background in administration will meet young attractive ~ ~ heathens ~ ~ natives from oceania with vast tracts of land .
