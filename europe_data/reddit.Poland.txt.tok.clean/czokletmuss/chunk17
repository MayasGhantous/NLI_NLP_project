  as always . 
  they may take our lives but they wo n't take our dank memes !, 
  seriously though , it is kinda sad . 
  funny images wo n't change the reality and the reality is europe has a problem and no idea how to solve it . 
   communist monopoly board game i played `` kolejka '' several times and it 's a lot of fun . 
  russia can go fuck herself for all i care . 
   over the weekend , ipn reported that russia 's consumer watchdog rospotrebnadzor warned that the game is perceived as `` anti-russian '' and excessively critical of the soviet system . 
  well , since almost all poles are anti-russian and `` excessively critical of the soviet system '' i guess they are kinda right in this regard . 
  sure - if you leave me be in la plata !, 
  i 'm cool with it , seems logical . 
  so i take it that this list : 1 . 
  ottomans 1 . 
  france 1 . 
  venice 1 . 
  lithuania 1 . 
  sweden is correct , is it ? 
  so ... this means that papal states are a great power , right ? 
   let me know if anything is incorrect or if i forgot anyone . 
  glorious italian alliance is not counted as one state and we are a ( loose ) confederation after all . 
   which foreign tourists have the worst reputation russians . 
   and why ? 
  they are russians . 
  seriously though i think it would be ... british ? 
  pissed lads pissing on our clean streets in krak\u00f3w and all that . 
  was n't this disaster featured in `` candide '' ? 
   displacing millions of gallons of water remove gallons - this is glorious yurop not murica , we have superior metric system !, 
   france is papal controller [ in case you do n't realize what you 've just said . 
  i denounce them as false christians , for only the abhorrent and unclean would join accursed savoyard heretics in attack against his holiness . 
  weak england + weak austria + weak burgundy + pro-french castille = bbb gone wild, 
  sad to hear this ; good luck and let 's hope your successor will be worthy !, 
  i also made a [ map of the second crusade against ottomans ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sercmwx.png ) as of 1 january 1500 . 
  if anyone wants more maps just let me know and i 'll see what can i do , 
  venice ** italian alliance ( relatively ) stronk, 
  or you could play as aztecs and prepare glorious invasion of europe :p, 
  inb4 swedes immigrating because sweden is dangerous . 
   turkish - russian alliance to balance the franco - iberian alliance . 
  and italy will be right in the middle  _ <, 
   i hope you know what you 're doing we hope so too . 
   good luck . 
  you guys have played well so far !, 
  thanks but it 's not us - it 's the will of god himself . 
  [ ** i edited the world map of 1 january 1500 so that you can see all provinces ' borders . 
  ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f7czvrm.png ) will you upload the save file as well ? 
  it 's pretty funny but where 's spain , russia and usa ? 
  great job !, 
  i 'll just post this screenshot showing [ ** glorious battle of the italian alliance vs ottoman & muscovite heathens ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hsmbdyt.jpg ) . 
  i was talking about * christians * mind you , not some heretics from afar . 
  but yeah , thanks for help , 
  sorry , similiar flag . 
  savoy must be contained . 
  also that ming . 
  thanks everyone , it was a really cool session !, 
  and here 's a [ ** screenshot showing glorious battle of the italian alliance ( his holiness , serene republic and great tyrol ) vs ottoman & muscovite heathens ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hsmbdyt.jpg ) . 
  ** as for other christians - like castille and france - i am dissapointed . 
  where were you when we took constantinople from the heathens ? 
  [ only good guy krak\u00f3w delivered ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9uf7fdi.jpg ) ... 
  with all respect to his regime victims , hitler and stalin were in a completely different league . 
  imagine the same thing going on before adolf hitler statue in berlin in 2016 . 
  and that 's how to tell whether the country you are from was on the wrong side of the iron curtain . 
  aww yiss, 
  please do , i would love to take a closer look before the game starts . 
  * triggered *, 
  france be like `` i wanted to dow england and i would have gotten away with it too , if it were n't for you meddling italians '' . 
  [ as his holiness ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/c/c3/vaticanball.png ) i tell you , my children , that italy shall rise again . 
  ** also will there be some kind of summary after this round ? 
  i know everybody will be busy playing but it would be nice to have some screenshots ( steam ones or f10s map saves ) . 
  hormuz can into space it seems, 
  yeah , something like this . 
  or maybe we should start a new sub ( / r/europeplayseu4 or something ) ? 
  / u/ilikemoneytoo - make sure to start a new thread ( summary + maps and stats pls ) , 
  i see . 
  alright then , next time perhaps . 
  pls use rnw , it 's gon na spice things up  i think i 'll stick with papal states , never played as them in singleplayer . 
  btw accept my invitation on steam please . 
  question to / u/ilikemoneytoo - will we use random new world ? 
  also which nations are left ? 
  i do n't know which one should i pick . 
  any majors left or just some scraps in rotw ? 
  for now ** i claim papal states ** . 
  sure ... 
   what is general relationship between poland and ukraine ? 
  `` it 's complicated '' . 
  we share a difficult past ( for instance check [ khmelnytsky uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising ) and [ volhynian slaughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) ) but i think that if we deal with that we can be good neighbors . 
  i 've been to ukraine once , it 's a beautiful country although ruined by soviet union and corruption . 
  the whole crimea affair brought us together somewhat - i even sent some food and other basic supplies together with my family to ukraine shortly after annexation ( there was a national action , you could send a package free of charge via public post ) . 
  i have nothing against ukrainians . 
  i hope one day we can be closer as nations . 
  plus everyone who does n't like russia is half-way to become a pole 's friend anyways . 
  nobody i know cares . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/qcy68cwdkve ), 
  you have my vote . 
   holocaust role role of a victim , that is . 
  unlike the french for instance we did n't cooperate with nazis by betraying our fellow citizens of jewish origins . 
  i 'm not a big fan of these legislative plans but seriously , if you think poland participated in holokaust you can go fuck yourself . 
  so basically : racism + guns = more violence racism - guns = less violence who would have thought ? 
  is this another infamous russian `` xaxaxa i trick you '' ? 
  russian bombs ca n't melt polish planes !, 
  ** russia ** is a beautiful country with incredibly rich cultural heritage and amazing landspaces , from kaliningrad to petropavlovsk-kamchatsk and vladivostok . 
  please stay where you are , russian soldiers , no need to go on vacations to other countries .
