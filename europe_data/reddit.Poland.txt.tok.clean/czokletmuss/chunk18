   so far russian opposition calls for bloody revolution and tire burning and says things like ** `` russian nation is the cancer on the face of the planet '' . 
  ** huh ... 
  thank you for your service o7, 
  huh , i would expect such post on / r/collapse rather than / r/europe . 
  in any case , this is just another proof that the world is literally dying ( dozens of species every week ) because of us . 
  so crimea is a part of ukraine , eh ? 
  i 'm afraid you 're gon na spend some time in reeducation camp comrade , you 've been poisoned by western propaganda . 
  good we poland very much strong no need for smell imigrant . 
  [ also this . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/xcqdjyo1b-8 ), 
  i was trying to write something clever as a comment but you know what , fuck russia . 
  we are of many unique special . 
   ziobro described oettinger 's remarks - made last weekend , by reference to an eu supervisory mechanism - as `` silly . ''  he also accused berlin of media `` censorship '' in trying to `` hush up '' the new year 's eve sex assaults . 
  * poland gains +5 power projection * * poland loses 10 prestige *  `` you [ oettinger ] demanded that poland be placed under ` supervision ' . 
  such words , spoken by a german politician , have the worst possible connotations for poles , '' ziobro wrote in an open letter , cited by the polish presss agency , pap . 
   `` for me , too . 
  i am the grandson of a polish officer who , during world war ii , fought in [ poland 's ] underground home army against ` german supervision ' . '' * germany has gained * ** insult casus belli ** * against * * poland * ** `` they have insulted us !, 
   the only reason third world migrants would go there is if western europe or nordic countries are a no-go . 
  paris has no-go zones , do n't you watch fox news ? 
   middle power : ex : austria , brazil , mexico , sweden , poland poland ** stronk !, 
  unexpected sauron on giewont ? 
   this is basically 1939 all over again . 
  lol . 
  and coming from a german ? 
  top kek - gr8 b8 m8, 
  power !, 
  unlimited * power !, 
  the important thing to remember while discussing this is that paris agreement is aimed at stopping the global warming at +1.5 c in respect to pre-industrial revolution level . 
  [ we 're currently at +1.26 c. 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/2016-set-to-be-hottest-year-on-record-globally ) even if we turned off all coal power plants in the world tomorrow it 's already too late to prevent self-reinforcing and mutually reinforcing feedback loops from arising . 
  the greenland and western antarctica are melting , the permafrost is thawing , the methane is being released all over the world . 
  no matter what we do we 're done . 
  would i like to see poland going 100 % renewable ? 
  sure . 
  would this affect the planet in any tangible way ? 
  not at all . 
  there are over 7,000 mln people on this planet with 1,5 mln being added ** every week . 
  ** with global warming directly affecting food supply and with depleting resources such enormous population can not be sustained . 
  clean energy is only part of the problem and all the solar panels in the world wo n't help us here in europe when the middle eastern countries with bloated population begin to collapse . 
  tl ; dr - paris agreement is too little too late, 
   the cancer that is russia  nothing good came from russia ever . 
  i do n't know you but i think this could be a beginning of a beatiful friendship !, 
  well , the global warming * is * happening for decades now , what were you expecting ? 
  do n't forget that on 9 december the constitutional tribunal will be in session yet again , this time ruling in case of the second bill amending the constitutional tribunal act , so it 's just a beginning . 
  i have n't read the court ruling yet ( only took a quick look ) but it seems that there were no surprises . 
  i 'm more interested in tribunal 's opinion regarding the second bill ( the one written by the law & justice ) . 
  here 's the address of the president of republic of poland regarding the constitutional crisis if anyone is interested ( in polish ) : https://youtu.be/1l2na77bco0, 
  both parties are to be blamed . 
  only the circumstances ( new government after 8 years of civic platform rule ) have changed . 
  also interesting and more in-depth analysis : http://constitutional-change.com/poland-constitutional-crisis-or-coup-detat i 've been following this whole affair closely so if anyone is interested in more details ama . 
  full press release and ruling available ( in spanish ) on the tribunal 's webpage : http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/salaprensa/pages/default.aspx, 
  as it was expected .

  joke is on uk - the co2 pumped in the air thanks to the subsidies is affecting gulf stream due to global warming :  ** the gulf stream that helps to keep britain from freezing over in winter is slowing down faster now than at any time in the past millennium ** according to a study suggesting that major changes are taking place to the ocean currents of the north atlantic . 
   now freshwater coming off the greenland ice sheet is likely disturbing the circulation . 
  ** so the human-caused mass loss of the greenland ice sheet appears to be slowing down the atlantic overturning , and this effect might increase if temperatures are allowed to rise further ** , '' dr box said . 
  source : http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/gulf-stream-is-slowing-down-faster-than-ever-scientists-say-10128700.html  the gulf stream brings warmth to the uk and north-west europe and is the reason we have mild winters . 
  ** without this steady stream of warmth the british isles winters are estimated to be more than 5c cooler , bringing the average december temperature in london to about 2c . 
  **  at the end of the last ice age , when the ice sheet covering north america melted , the sudden increase in fresh water reduced the salinity of the north atlantic surface water and therefore less ` dense water ' sank and moved towards the equator . 
  ** this reduced , or even shut-down completely , the warm gulf stream . 
  temperatures in north-west europe fell by 5c in just a few decades . 
  ** source : http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/impact/gulf_stream.shtml you are digging your own grave , you poor things . 
  this is cool indeed !, 
  til, 
  you are correct but i ca n't imagine , say , sejmik of vovodeship ( kinda like ccaa in spain ) saying that they want independence without any consequences . 
  words matter when they are spoken by elected officials . 
  i really hope this whole affair wo n't end with use of violence . 
  i really like spain and spaniards , i do n't want to see them suffer from internal conflict . 
   catalonia 's regional parliament has backed a declaration on monday to start a formal secession process from spain . 
  the region plans to establish autonomous rule by 2017 . 
  should n't all the pms of ca de catalunya be arrested then ? 
  this is basically high treason and flagrant violation of the constitution . 
   fossil-fuel free nation so they do n't use any plastic than ? 
  or oil ? 
  or fertilizers ? 
  or asphalt ? 
  ** they are as addicted to the fossil fuels as we all are ** . 
  they just get a really high percentage of * electrical power * from so-called renewable energy sources and plan to make it even higher . 
  it 's not like wind turbines or hydroelectric power stations are made of pure sunshine . 
  ah , lipka tatars , one of the last remnants of the diversity of the old commonwealth . 
  it 's such a shame that we have so few communities like this left after ww1 , ww2 , holocaust and border changes & ethnic cleansings ordered by stalin after the war . 
  violation of human rights as an answer to violation of human rights ? 
  what happened to freedom and justice for all ? 
  to allow anyone to be put in american prison is a violation of human rights . 
  top kek m8, 
  seriously ? 
  why ? 
  it 's good to know we 're doing our best to make sure there is no hope in stopping global warming . 
  fuck the environment , it 's not like we need crops of fish anyway - labor unions ' and stakeholders ' interests come first !, 
  * facepalm *, 
  i 'm 1/128 american so i concur - if there 's something we americans do n't like it 's being smug and condescending . 
  i could explain it but i fear that you would n't understand . 
  i 'm saying that socialistic government never really worked out anywhere - even ussr with all its oil and natural gas and abundance of other resources collapsed badly . 
  btw which countries do you consider to be `` socialist-leaning '' ? 
  venezuela ? 
  sweden ? 
  north korea ? 
  it 's too much nuanced to discuss it on reddit , i 'm just telling what are the thoughts of  90 % of voters in poland on this more or less . 
  oil . 
  when you have petromonies you do n't have to worry about cash problems - saudi arabia is an opressive absolute monarchy and the saudis live at high level due to oil , but is it really an argument for monarchy ?
