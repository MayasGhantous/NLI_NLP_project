  let 's take a look :  fascism / \u02c8f\u00e6\u0283\u026az\u0259m / is a form of ** radical authoritarian nationalism ** that came to prominence in early 20th-century europe . 
  influenced by ** national syndicalism , fascism originated in italy during world war i , in opposition to liberalism , marxism , and anarchism . 
  ** fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional left -- right spectrum . 
   fascists saw world war i as a revolution . 
  it brought revolutionary changes in the nature of war , society , the state , and technology . 
  the advent of total war and total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant . 
  a `` military citizenship '' arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war the war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines , as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens . 
  ** fascists view world war i as having made liberal democracy obsolete , and regard total mobilization of society under a totalitarian single-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties . 
  such a state is led by a strong leader -- such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party -- to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society . 
  fascism rejects assertions of violence automatically being negative in nature and views political violence , war , and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation . 
  **  ** fascists advocate a mixed economy , with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies . 
  ** following world war ii , few parties have openly described themselves as fascist , and the term is usually used pejoratively by political opponents . 
  the terms neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes applied more formally to describe parties of the far right with ideologies similar to , or rooted in , 20th century fascist movements . 
  so to answer your question : not at all . 
  unless you think every right wing party = hitler/mussolini and every left wing party = stalin/mao . 
  tl ; dr - you guys only talk about communism , socialism etc. , we actually had to live in a state build in accordance with these ideologies and it fucking sucks, 
  can confirm , i 'm chewing one right now and i voted for pis . 
   usually denounced as nutty catholic right-wingers , law and justice are in fact a sui generis ** movement of truculent , carefully eurosceptic \u00e9tatist-patriots . 
  **  ** they urge a `` strong poland '' , ** by which they mainly mean robust and sternly honest state institutions , and a square deal for state employees and pensioners . 
  latterly law and justice have made a successful effort to broaden their appeal towards small businesses and younger voters . 
  but they are ** instinctively suspicious of big business and banks ** , and loath to do anything radical to reform state processes or advance privatisation/deregulation . 
  they are comfortable playing to conservative catholic instincts of older polish voters , but ** they see the catholic church as a patriotic force : they are not religious zealots . 
  **  in foreign policy terms law and justice will be to the fore in pressing that europe and the west ** stand firm against russian neo-imperialism ** in ukraine and syria ( more nato , please ) , while cautious in what that means in practice . 
  that 's pretty good ( though laconic ) description . 
  it may be hard to understand where do they come from without knowledge about polish political history in 20th century though , so take this article with a grain of salt . 
  and kill all the children after they burn all the gays , do n't forget about that . 
   or simply by\u0107 . 
  bitch !, 
  i must visit vilnius at some point . 
  come on guys , it 's easy !, 
  not bad , not bad . 
  in english it would be like `` shvyershch '' but it was close enough . 
  you may apply for citizenship right away !, 
  perhaps . 
  how would you pronounce '' \u015bwierszcz '' ? 
  you mean `` antother 4 years '' after being fucked for 7 years , right ? 
  so to sum it up : * pis won a historic victory ( first party to form cabinet without need to seek coalition ) with  50 % seats in sejm * po got rekted hard ( and good riddance ! ), 
  * post-communistic left consisting of corrupt grandpas was annihilated ( and good riddance ! ), 
  * newly formed party kukiz got surprising amount of votes * nowoczesna aka po 2.0 got quite a lot votes * psl will continue its pathetic existence * korwin almost got 5 % and perhaps will get in the end * razem got public funding , we can expect modern left party in the parliament in 4 years - finally !, 
  we will have fascist dictatorship and will start to exterminate all jews and foreigners . 
  that 's what you wanted to hear ? 
  butthurt much ? 
  we will have left party in 4 years ( razem got public funding due to surpassing 3 % ) . 
  what we do n't have is a bunch of postcommunist dinosaurs and cynical clown ( palikot ) . 
  i say good riddance !, 
  it 's about time we have normal , modern left party like razem instead of old grandpas like miller and company . 
  three parties which get together 15 % did n't surpass the 5 % ( 8 % for coalition ) threshold , so they wo n't get any seats -  they will be distributed among other parties . 
  making a photo and posting it on the internet is lower effort than copying link to an article ? 
  what a weird point of view to hold . 
  nice try , illuminati . 
  okay guys , [ who voted already ?

  disclaimer - this is perfectly legal and does not affect the validity of a vote . 
  according to polish law we ca n't really discuss politics today ( at least until 9:00 pm ) so it would be good if the live thread could be extended for another day , thus allowing us to actually contribute anything , 
  glorious o7, 
  no we would n't , you commie !, 
  [ sure ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/election_silence ), 
  the best i could find in foreign media . 
  does he have a public attorney ? 
  that would be agitation during election silence , which is prohibited by polish law . 
  i suggest you use wiki or ask some foreigner savvy in polish politics . 
  shh , we have cisza wyborcza now , no agitation please . 
  excerpt from the press release :  as a political community , we are responsible for the condition of european solidarity , openness and freedom . 
  and this means that we can no longer allow solidarity to be equivalent to naivety , openness to be equivalent to helplessness , freedom to be equivalent to chaos . 
  and by that , i am of course referring to the situation on our borders . 
   if we want europe to continue on its path of solidarity , openness and freedom , we can not abdicate -- as the political leaders of many countries -- from our most important duties , and to surrender our attributes of public authority . 
  and the primary duty of public authority has always been to provide security for its own community , and to protect its own territory . 
  ** today , no task is more important for the moderate centre-right than the re-establishment of europe 's external borders . 
  and not in order to make europe into an inaccessible fortress , but to effectively protect the values i have just mentioned . 
  **  when it comes to solidarity , i feel like a professional with lifelong experience . 
  believe me when i say , that solidarity requires strength and effectiveness . 
  ** if you want to help others , you need to first be able to take care of yourself and your loved ones . 
  a europe which is na\u00efve , helpless and disorganised will be unable to display solidarity in the long run . 
  **  we must end at once this completely unnecessary argument between the proponents of protecting external borders and the advocates of solidarity and openness . 
  both are among us here today . 
  what we need is a rational hybrid of both ways of thinking . 
  ** we can not pretend any longer that the great tide of migrants is something that we want , and that we are conducting a well thought-out policy of open borders . 
  the truth is different : we have lost our ability to protect our borders , and in this sense , our openness is not our conscious choice , but a proof of our weakness . 
  on the other hand , we can not give-in to populism and xenophobia , because our political aim should be to strengthen europe against right-wing extremists , and not to become like them . 
  **  from the beginning of the migration crisis , i have been a proponent of collective responsibility for the security of our borders , as it is a pre-condition for any migration policy , whatever we understand by that . 
  a collective responsibility and effective actions on our borders will allow us to re-build genuine solidarity among member states , and to bring an end to the shameful arguments over relocation . 
  because ordinary citizens are ready and willing to help migrants , but at the same time , they expect their leaders to fulfil the basic duties of public authority . 
  citizens want to feel safe again , because only then will they be capable of helping people in need . 
  this is a good and healthy principle . 
  and madrid is the best place to remind us of this .
