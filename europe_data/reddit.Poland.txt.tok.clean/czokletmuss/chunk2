  you mean duda , right ? 
  he assumed his office as a president like 30 days ago so it 's hard to tell ; he surely is pro-american but i would worry more about trump than him . 
  btw wtf is wrong with you guys , how can trump have more than 5 % support ? 
  with mead and kurwas . 
  bad choice of words , sorry - intermarium just more or less covers the region we 're talking about . 
   so all in all i fail to see a pattern of polish/german opposition . 
  so far ( last 15 years or so ) we were ver pro-germany but it may change after our parliamentary elections ( law & justice is rather pro-us than pro-germany ) and due to the immigration crisis . 
  there is only one thing poles hate more than russian government and it 's - you know what , actually there is n't anything more hated i think . 
  today v4 is a joke but hypothetically with more countries joining a unified front in the eu surely would be heard better . 
  what counts are also votes and seats in eu institutions . 
  i doubt even germany could enforce something if , say , benelux and v10 would jointly say no . 
  this is all pure speculation of course . 
  unless we call it warsaw pact 2.0 . 
  `` deep historical roots '' is questionable - for instance poland had historicall much more in common with lietuva and ukraine than czech republic , so i would say that common interests and the size of economies was the deciding factor . 
  of course hungary is the best bro , `` pole and hungarian cousins be '' and all that . 
  i would have nothing against v10 or some other eastern european block and who knows , perhaps in the future due in part to this whole immigration things something like this will form . 
   yeah and everything would change for better . 
  there would be no czech bitching about how those dirty polish are trying to impose their religion , there would be no slovak or hungarian nationalist movements did i say austro-hungary or polish-lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  v4 is a very lose organisation of several states created `` for the purposes of furthering their european integration as well as advancing their military , economic and energy cooperation with one another '' . 
  i 'm talking about closer cooperation so that the interests of eastern europe could be better protected within the eu , not some confederacy . 
  da king in danorf !, 
  sure but you must gib free legos for everyone . 
  soon we shall have a new right-wing pm and cabinet and the world will tremble before our - wait , what you were talking about again ? 
   seek to form a smaller union with the eastern block . 
  bulgaria ( kiss you cutie ;p ) , moldova ( kiss you too ) , poland ( high-five ) , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , croatia , slovenia , the baltic states and ukraine ( if we manage to snatch her from the claws of the bear ) . 
  let 's do this guys !, 
  but seriously , stronger and expanded v4 would be a good way to counter influence of germany in the eu . 
  1 like = 1 less dirty immigrant in glorious poland i fail to see how stupid facebook protest ( ? ), 
  is relevant in any way . 
  hey , if your chancellor invited them to germany than that 's on you . 
  and there you have it , awefulness of british food confirmed - not even starving refugees from war-torn countries want to touch this stuff . 
  i did n't vote for you mr vice-chancellor , why should i care what you think ? 
  it is as if germany was willingly trying to dismantle eu . 
  remember that our pm is a leader of a ruling party which is losing support quickly and there are parliamentary elections in c. 1 month . 
  this is just a public relations gimmick . 
  i did actually , two guys from iraq - very industrious at their studies and pretty popular with the ladies . 
  though they were certainly not rich , more or less on a level of avarage student ( that is dirt poor ) . 
  shh is all part of a plan . 
  i 've read von mises and rothbard , even `` constitution of liberty '' by von hayek and one book by friedman but i do n't recall the title . 
  oh and ayn rand too , `` fountainhead '' and `` atlas shrugged '' . 
  what do you want to know specifically ? 
   the sentence itself is still extremely insulting to eastern europeans well obviously !, 
  he confused us with gypsies , that damned racist . 
  ** inalienable ** ( adjective ) - not alienable ; not transferable to another or capable of being repudiated * example : inalienable rights . 
  * also :  whereas recognition of the ** inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family ** is the foundation of freedom , justice and peace in the world ...  preamble to the universal declaration of human rights, 
  unfortunately yes . 
  inshallah , that 's just what i need !, 
   will that be in cash or credit ? 
  how about oil ? 
  sure !, 
  like ... errr ... there was a guy who ... ahem ... well ... yeah . 
  can you super-size it for me ? 
  and i would like some freedom fries with that . 
   what you propose is literally `` guantanamo bay '' - you feel that someone is a danger , so fuck the law , fuck justice , just lock them away , without charges and without trial . 
  do n't forget ~ ~ torture ~ ~ waterboarding and rectal feeding . 
   what race is terrorist exactly ? 
  inferior obviously . 
  you did n't call him out . 
  you literally said he is not a human :  i do n't think scum like this should have any human rights . 
  i do n't even class them as human . 
  this is much worse than `` calling out '' imho . 
  for the same reason you are allowed to speak your mind even if what you say is derogatory and hateful . 
   do you think people deserve their human rights if they put innocent lives at risk ? 
  yes . 
  either everyone has human rights or nobody has them and those who qualify have temporary privileges , not `` human rights '' . 
  even serial killers have right to attorney , right to privacy etc. 
  by saying that someone is not a human it follows that he may be treated like a not-human , that is animal or an object . 
  your opinion would make sense if you would say that there are no human rights but by definition they are irrevokable , inalienable and fundamental . 
   but i guess with people for whom muslims are really low on the ladder , you 'll rise even more . 
  that ... actually makes sense . 
  all the negative stereotypes will be now projected at muslim immigrants , so we will be perceived better . 
  huh . 
  the thing with eastern europe being anti-immigration is that ( 1 ) most of countries were subjected to russification or in other way subjogated by another country , thus we value our culture more ( 2 ) we have no tradition of imperialism and colonisation like uk , france or belgium , so we do n't have that much experience with dealing with people from africa and middle east ( 3 ) due to ethnic cleansing , genocide and ww2 in general some societies like in case of poland are almost completel homogenous . 
  it does n't come out of nowhere , it really makes sense when you think about the historical context - not that it justifies blatant racism obviously . 
  but there are fundamental differences between eastern and western europe when it comes to this issue . 
   other than being right-wing libertarian , what in the above describes paul ? 
  being a fruitcake ? 
   fucking hell - i do n't think scum like this should have any human rights . 
  i do n't even class them as human . 
  racist found . 
  i wonder how could you know what i 'm thinking when you know nothing about me save for one comment on reddit . 
  nah , in poland it would be more or less like : 1 ) westerners ( western europe , murica etc. ), 
  - we still have inferiority complex 2 ) glorious poles best nation 3 ) other catholic and protestant europeans 4 ) eastern europe 5 ) russia 6 ) foreigners ( sa , africa , asia , black people , not-christians ) 7 ) gypsies jews depending on whom you ask may be on lvl 1 ( jewish conspiracy rules the world ! 11 ) , lvl 7 ( because jews ) or somewhere in between . 
  i wo n't waste my free time arguing in the internet that xenophoby is a bad idea . 
  poor strawman since i was talking about attitude of mohammad khaled and the like - i did n't say ** all ** refugees are like him . 
  i told you ; he should switch to baptism , get us citizenship and try his luck in bible belt . 
  this man said publicly during presidential elections that he want enthronement of jesus christ as a king of poland ( sic ! ), 
  and nuclear weapons for polish armed forces - in the same sentence . 
  i 'm not making this up : https://youtu.be/_weggzahtte he 's a monarchist who believes poland is controlled by the jews and freemasons . 
  any questions ? 
  he 's basically a polish national-catholic-right-wing-libertarian / monarchist nutjob with a flavor of anti-semitism and anti-freemasonism ; he gained 0,83 % in presidential elections this year . 
  so more like polish rand paul . 
  edit : i forgot to mention - according to him abortion = murder , `` sodomy '' must be stopped , death penalty should be introduced , everyone deserves right to carry firearms and poland is ruled by mafia and freemasonry . 
  [ watch in all his glory here ( only in polish ) ] ( https://youtu.be/_weggzahtte ), 
  i do n't trust anything and anyone supporting grzegorz braun , sorry . 
  so basically western europeans  eastern europeans  syrians  gypsies ? 
  well i know about these obvious facts :p, 
  this attitude really pisses me off . 
  millions of poles are busting their asses working in other eu countries and earning their wages and these guys *** demand *** better conditions because they deserve them somehow ? 
   `` we need ( ... ) to study and have a good life '' fuck this .
