  the truth is different : we have lost our ability to protect our borders , and in this sense , our openness is not our conscious choice , but a proof of our weakness . 
  on the other hand , we can not give-in to populism and xenophobia , because our political aim should be to strengthen europe against right-wing extremists , and not to become like them . 
  **  from the beginning of the migration crisis , i have been a proponent of collective responsibility for the security of our borders , as it is a pre-condition for any migration policy , whatever we understand by that . 
  a collective responsibility and effective actions on our borders will allow us to re-build genuine solidarity among member states , and to bring an end to the shameful arguments over relocation . 
  because ordinary citizens are ready and willing to help migrants , but at the same time , they expect their leaders to fulfil the basic duties of public authority . 
  citizens want to feel safe again , because only then will they be capable of helping people in need . 
  this is a good and healthy principle . 
  and madrid is the best place to remind us of this . 
  museum is good , public square is unacceptable , especially since a lot of these guys are guilty of genocide and other crimes against humanity . 
  of course in poland after such removal we would probably just put a jan pawe\u0142 ii statues in freed places * sigh *, 
  we can into modern . 
  poland 1 . 
  repeat step 1 . 
  i hope one day all of these ungainly statues erected by ussr will be removed for good . 
   as a white american that has strongly considered moving to europe please do n't , we have enough racists as it is . 
  what 's this , something going over my head ? 
  no it did n't : dddddddd / s, 
  i meant i 'm getting pissed off . 
  as a pole i alway feel my blood pressure rising after watching these videos . 
   in the us a lot of people rationalize stuff for themselfs which is incomprehensible for europeans and vote for the republicans you are on / r/europe , not / r/politics - nobody cares about us political parties here . 
  well , you 've got to kill if you want to live ( eat ) . 
  i actually would like to experience it , what with living in a city with meat arriving in sealed plastic packages . 
  it would be a good remainder of what is really happening in thousands of slaughterhouses around the world . 
   islam was ` never part of europe ' : hungary 's orban ** actually islam spread to europe through iberian peninsula before hungary formed . 
  ** muslims crossed the straits of gibraltar and conquered the rock in 711 and the principality of hungary was formed in 895 after conquest of carpathian basin by hungarian barbarians from the steppe . 
  so if islam is not a part of europe ( and when granada fell in 1492 the ottomans already were firmly established on our side of bosporus ) , than hungary surely is not either . 
  also arguably there are regions in europe ( andalusia in spain , balkans ) which have more in common with the islamic world than with hungary . 
  so this argument is complete bullshit . 
   `` islam has never been part of europe , it came to us , '' and that is true . 
  sure . 
  but neither is christianity ( which started as jewish sect in middle east ) . 
  or germans . 
  or franks . 
  or slavs . 
  depending how far back you go , you could even say that homo sapiens was never a part of europe - we came to it when it was already inhabited by neandertals . 
  romania and poland are just two small countries .

   germany registers 409,000 migrants in 40 days .

  have fun germany , you should 've thought about this before inviting whole third world to your cities !, 
   in easter europe pretty much everyone has seen a pig slaughtering so not much outrage . 
  here 's my opinion : in this century most of the big mammals living on land who are not livestock like cows or pigs *** will *** go extinct . 
  their habitats are destroyed and poluted , their prey decimated , they themselves are slowly dying off since at least early 18th century and begining of industrial revolution . 
  lions , tigers , bears - all of them are already gone and nothing can change this . 
  one more or less does n't affect anything . 
  most important part :  in a judicial investigation dating back to last year , the court called mas to go before a judge on october 15 , in a written ruling released on tuesday . 
   prosecutors accuse him of civil disobedience , abuse of power and embezzlement of public funds in organising last november 's ballot . 
   `` we are faced with a political lawsuit , the political orchestration of a case brought by the state prosecution service , '' the spokeswoman for mas 's government , neus munte , told a news conference . 
   ** mas and two other officials are accused of breaking the law by organising the ballot on november 9 , 2014 , in defiance of an injunction by spain 's constitutional court . 
  if found guilty they could be banned from public office . 
  ** i think he will be sentenced , what he did seems to be a flagrant violation of the constitution . 
  nobody should be above the law .

   sober refugee shelter : ` food is boring , tents are cold and no sex ' it 's almost as if it was n't a hotel but , you know , *** a refugee shelter . 
   ` food is boring , tents are cold and no sex ' 6/10 would not immigrate again  they are angry about the living conditions in the camp , so angry in fact that in protest they skipped breakfast and lunch . 
  `` hunger strike ? 
  yes . 
  and we will maintain it . '', 
  breakfast and lunch they got for free . 
  you know , every day i see some homeless and hungry people on streets of warsaw , so all i have to say to this is fuck you . 
   says abt .

  winter is coming ... 
  sorry for memes but i 'm past the point at which i was taking this whole affair seriously , now i just laugh and enjoy schadenfreude . 
   a new `` red card '' system to bring power back from brussels to britain . 
  this would give groups of national parliaments the power to stop unwanted directives being handed down and to scrap existing eu laws great idea , mr cameron !, 
  let 's implement it in the uk , shall we ? 
  from now on let 's allow scottish parliament to `` stop unwanted directives '' by giving them right to veto any and all legislation of uk parliament and `` scrap '' existing uk laws if they do n't like them . 
  or you know what , let 's give this right to national assembly of wales and northern ireland assembly . 
  also wales , scotland and northern ireland should have the right to use euro instead of the pound - let 's make it clear that uk is a `` multi-currency '' union . 
  i 'm sure this would increase effectivness of the uk government and make everyone happy . 
  something something hitler something something all germans are nazis something something why your grandpa was murdering the jews ? 
  ayyy, 
  hon hon hon, 
  everything 's a laughing matter . 
  it 's not only law that matters , also what rulings are passed by the judges and how society approaches such things . 
  but yeah , shame on you :p, 
  short answer is that polish transformation started in 1989 , 10 years after transici\u00f3n in spain and our left-wing parties are a total joke , so although both poland and spain are historically very catholic we are lagging behind in regard of things like this . 
  but it 's not like you guys are so much better :  articulo 525 del codigo penal  1 . 
  that 's more or less what our article 196 of penal code states . 
  what has always been bugging me is that we do n't have the part concerning `` de quienes no profesan religi\u00f3n o crencia alguna '' , so only religious feelings are protected . 
  schadenfreude - but i wo n't use it because it 's german and right now i 'm laughing at germany . 
  i 'm more surprised by how conservative the tribunal turned out to be . 
  i have n't had time to read the whole ruling though .

   i love how korwin people are calling out pools for having low % of voters on him - they are not awere in how small internet boubble they are in for over 25 years korwin gets 1-3 % every election and yet they always believe `` this time it 's gon na work out !,
