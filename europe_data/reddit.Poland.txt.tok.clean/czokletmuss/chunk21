   i just do n't feel it 's right for me to influence my country 's politics and realities when they do not affect me directly . 
  that 's reasonable actually . 
  korwin is pretty retarted but braun is the retardest . 
   edit : to explain this bit : korwin followers are commonly referred to as `` kuce '' that translates to `` ponies '' . 
  ponies ? 
  lol more like `` ponytails '' . 
  and they look [ like this ] ( https://kefir2010.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/korwin-mikke-kuce.jpg ) . 
  this is a stereotype of course but there is a grain of truth to it . 
   he seems to be quite weird . 
  he 's basically polish catholic ron paul but he 's more of a troll . 
  and he has a fetish for russia for some reason . 
  so fringe convservative libertard . 
  awesome !, 
  it 's confirmed , poland stronk . 
  we should take advantage of our superior military and sphere indonesia , this would ensure lots of resources for our economy . 
  or even canada !, 
  seriously though it 's not surprising to see polish armed forces ahead of bundeswehr considering that we were involved in middle east in pointless wars ( good training though ) and that we border russia , byelarus and ukraine and thus are more concerned about security . 
   how do you plan to vote in the upcoming election ? 
  ** prawo i sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 ( law and justice ) **  has this changed as a result of the crisis ? 
  which crisis ? 
  refugees ? 
  financial crisis ? 
  in either case the answer is ** no ** . 
  edit : so i got downvoted for directly answering op 's question ? 
  but ... why ? 
  does it though ? 
  have n't some countries which used to use imperial units switched to metric ? 
   i 've never met nor heard anyone say anything bad about you lads . 
  plot twist - these were all poles speaking perfect english . 
   why , op ? 
  why ? 
  / u/citronbleu , why do you hate la libert\u00e9 ? 
   yeah , makes sense . 
  not at all . 
  the wickedness must be stamped out !, 
  obscurese . 
   add some szcz and it 's prefect !, 
  do n't forget about - \u0144ski and several '' \u0105c '' and `` d\u017aw '' !, 
  l o l o l, 
   360-mile what is this , 19th century ? 
  use the superior metric system for god 's sake . 
  down with opression of imperial units !, 
  picture that : a movie about 3 polish firemen ( j\u0119drzej , zdzis\u0142aw and marek ) in some rural powiat who struggle with alcoholism and poverty and now have to take care of 25-year old ahmed ibn muhammad from afghanistan . 
  they try to connect with him , experience cultural differences , problems with communication , language barrier ; the guy sleeps in a broken fridge and after some time spent together they start taking him to work , putting out fire together and dealing with stereotypical dwellers of polish countryside . 
  ahmed learns the taste of kielbasa and finds his true love . 
  [ hilarity ensues ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/hilarityensues ) . 
  and since this is a polish movie , he would have to be murdered at the end by rabid racists or something . 
  tears mix with vodka and protagonists learn that intolerance is bad , m ` kay . 
  i was in ireland like 10 years ago and i agree , it was freaking beatiful . 
  i want to go back at some point . 
   two men were arrested by gardai in the vicinity of killeen woods on wednesday evening . 
  both were questioned at tralee garda station before being released without charge . 
  the pair , in their late 20s and early 30s , are eastern european nationals though neither is russian . 
  both have addresses in the kerry area . 
  why i have the feeling the perpetrators were polish ... 
  i know , i 've been thinking about studying portugese . 
   honestly i 'm surprised he has n't deleted it for some bullshit reason . 
  ** thread closed , op is troublemaker - banned . 
  ** * le thread \u00e7los\u00e8e , op est l'banned\u00e9 hon hon hon *, 
  that 's one of the reasons i stopped learning french and switched to spanish - save for france , some former african colonies and tiny overseas territories nobody speaks french . 
  meanwhile spanish is afaik even more commonly used than english ( whole sa + good chunk of na + spain obviously ) . 
  looks better than in real life ( i live here ) !, 
  man i want to eat one right now so badly . . 
  well , we shared everything from kings to poets , we can surely share a cake !, 
   warsaw 4k in the grim darkness of the eastern poland there are only investments . 
  s\u0119kacz is lithuanian ? 
  ** country : ** poland ** favorite neighbour : ** lietuva ** least favorite neighbour : ** russia ( duh ), 
  lol this is gold :d, 
  these images are funny because they share the inherent flaw of all futurology - the authors just took what seemed at a time as a future trend and extrapolated it . 
  it never works out . 
  most of the stuff / r/futurology jerks off too is as unrealistic as playing cricket underwater . 
  i do n't accept them :p but yeah , you are probably right . 
  we got used to our ss . 
  it 's more complicated than that . 
  article 13 of our constitution says :  political parties and other organizations whose programmes are based upon totalitarian methods and the modes of activity of nazism , fascism and communism , as well as those whose programmes or activities sanction racial or national hatred , the application of violence for the purpose of obtaining power or to influence the state policy , or provide for the secrecy of their own structure or membership , shall be prohibited . 
  also article 256 of penal code states that :  whoever publicly promotes a fascist or other totalitarian system of state or incites hatred based on national , ethnic , race or religious differences or for reason of lack of any religious denomination shall be subject to a fine , the penalty of restriction of liberty or the penalty of deprivation of liberty for up to 2 years . 
  also [ there is a bill currently in parliament ] ( http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm7.nsf/przebiegproc.xsp?nr=283 ) which completely bans all communistic symbols from public space ( names of squares , roads , red starts etc. ), 
  but it 's been `` frozen '' for the past 4 years :p, 
  well they were kids . 
  allegedly . 
  if it was up to me we would 've got rid of all the soviet monuments long time ago . 
  it 's ridiculous that they are still there - can you imagine , say , wehrmacht or ss monument standing in paris ? 
  it 's insane . 
  on the one hand vandalism ( especially on graveyard ) is a bad thing . 
  on the other hand those were * soviet * graves and i 'm from poland , so ... 
  you have to pay for such things ?!, 
  what is this , alabama ? 
  nah just kidding - it 's good to have public healthcare though #justeuropeanthings, 
   til ussr and the whole soviet area are n't the same thing . 
  think of it as of the commonwealth ( eastern block ) and gb ( ussr ) . 
   the most important things are actually pretty clear . 
  `` die w\u00fcrde des menschen ist unantastbar '' is probably the clearest piece if legislation we have . 
  i understood this and i do n't even know german !, 
  that 's cool and all but more people live in the yellow areas than in the blue areas . 
  they are as dumb as we all are . 
  could you give me a link to source describing how sa wants to feed 60 mln people ? 
  by investing in agriculture on a desert ? 
  by creating energy-reliant industry ? 
  by creating strong services sector ( for whom exactly ) ? 
  black friday disease is spreading it seems .
