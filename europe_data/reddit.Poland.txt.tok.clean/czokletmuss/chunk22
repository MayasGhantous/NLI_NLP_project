  i would n't worry about sa that much . 
  one day the oil fields will run dry and [ 60 mln people ] ( http://www.photius.com/rankings/world2050_rank.html ) will discover that they have nothing to eat or drink , what with living on a desert , and nothing to trade for this things . 
  by that time of course the whole world will be well into the economical collapse but do n't worry , if you want `` evil '' to be punished than the saudis will suffer sooner or later . 
  the only collateral damage here is the brain damage it requires to believe in goebbels propaganda in 2016 . 
  greece = not a country confirmed . 
  i do n't think you have any idea what are you talking about . 
  legislation is much more complicated process than acting on your `` personal taste '' . 
   unlike in the u.s. , where ~ ~ industry has many opportunities to lobby and appeal legislation or punishment ~ ~ rule of law has been substituted by corporate interests and lobbying , the eu tends to ~ ~ leave companies with little recourse after a decision is made ~ ~ observe the law and principles of fairness and justice ftfy, 
  did n't know adeptus ministorum was building its new hq in romania . 
  til celebrity = opposition icon, 
  do n't argue with him , he 's a / r/thedonald user : /, 
  and gave them guns . 
  this again . 
  * sigh * independence referendum would be unconstitutional . 
  madrid and supreme court will never allow it . 
  do n't listen to these eurogay lies , the czechs and slovaks are just german puppets . 
  poland stronk and w\u0119gry stronk too , we ai n't need no european union !, 
  in both cases animals die for human pleasure - you would just prefer it to be hidden from sight because it 's easier not to think about it . 
  this is pure hipocrisy - it 's about getting others ( butchers , cooks etc. ), 
  to do the dirty work for you . 
  also keep in mind that dairy and meat industry is responsible for much more death and suffering than all bullfighting - like [ in this case ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dairy-industry-cows-settlement_us_57d1a4ade4b03d2d459926e4 ) when c. half million cows were killed * to keep prices higher . 
   i dont really care about what happens to the animals  what i care is about the setmind of the people who enjoy a murder show . 
  okay but ... how ? 
  so they can kill animals as long as they do n't enjoy it ? 
  i do n't get it , honestly . 
  but you still eat it . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  so if someone goes to watch bullfights but is not taking pleasure from it ( because he works there , he 's a tourist guide etc. ), 
  than it 's okay for you * because * he 's not taking pleasure ? 
  you ca n't really condemn using animals for enjoyment without condeming using them for pleasure ( tasty meat ) . 
  this does not follow . 
  how about killing for pleasure ( taste ) ? 
  you do n't need to eat meat . 
   spain bullfighting : thousands rally in madrid to demand ban yeah but all those animals killed for chorizo or jamon serrano or any other meal with meat in it ? 
  they can keep dying . 
  let he who is a vegetarian be the first to throw a stone . 
  first time i hear of this . 
  adorable .

  the / u/dslisser calls and ** the commonwealth ** will answer . 
  sure it does n't - there are a lot of educated dumb people - but it helps . 
  i mean hell , how can you go and throw your vote on something like this without spending at least some time thinking it through first ? 
  if you buy dumbed down propaganda and than do something stupid based on such propaganda ... well , it 's seems like something not-really-bright person would do . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  on the other hand poland with our new government is no longer the dumbest kid in the block , so there 's that .
