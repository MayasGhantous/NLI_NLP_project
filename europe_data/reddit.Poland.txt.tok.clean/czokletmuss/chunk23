  as always , pretty maps from the last session : ** [ political map 1602 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kdo7m9w.png ) **, 
  allah bless you !, 
   russia could take the baltics or even drive straight through poland . 
  well , this is the part which is worrying for folks here . 
   you could try pomerania for example . 
  pomerania is played by iddked afaik . 
  hrm jan iii olbracht sends salutations to the sublime port . 
  it is with great joy we hear that the great sultan is willing to help establish a new system of solving european disputes without needless bloodshed . 
  a balance of power is much needed on the continent if the war is to be prevented . 
  proper spheres of influence shall be established to the satisfaction of each of the great powers . 
  thus hrm jan iii olbrach proposes for all of the powers , that is : 1 . 
  the commonwealth 3 . 
  kingdom of france 4 . 
  great britain 5 . 
  sultanate of tunis 6 . 
  kingdom of italy 7 . 
  kingdom of portugal ** [ to convene for congress of warsaw and to discuss the future of europe .

  ** shall attend in the name of the commonwealth ** of polish , lithunian , prussian , rutheniana and byelorussian nations . 
  hrm jan iii olbracht wishes to maintain peace and stability in europe . 
  to this end hrm wishes to : * uphold the alliance with kingdom of italy , kingdom of prussia and sultanate of bukhara * continue to guarantee the independence of duchy of pomerania * call to king of france / u/chricri3112 and sultan of the ottoman empire / u/rhaktor to create a pan-european system of check and balances so that the old world is not consumed by warfare apart from the abovementioned issues , ** hrm jan iii olbracht wishes to declare neutrality in european conflicts ** - a splendid isolation , if you wish . 
  all christians and muslims are welcome in the commonwealth where we shall build a better world based on tolerance and rule of law . 
  additionaly , hrm jan iii olbrach is willing to give his protection to the persecuted and opressed . 
  *** long live the commonwealth !, 
  thank you for your service o7, 
  glorious ** poland ** shall attend - * muscowy delenda est !, 
   also energy in the usa is so cheap that most people do n't mind just leaving it on even though it 's terrible for the environment . 
  fuck these people . 
   i allied it aw hell naw, 
  y u so mean ; _ ;, 
   it might be an idea to make a meta thread to discuss this kind of stuff , so we can get everyone together . 
  hear , hear . 
  * triggered *, 
   also i want to be the baddies . 
  why would you want to play as the soviets ? 
  awesome . 
  perhaps we should make friday or sunday a hoi4 day so that we wo n't abandon eu4 campaign ? 
  dibs on poland !, 
   i really hope for an hearts of iron iv 's / r/europe multiplayer campaign once it comes out . 
  absolutely . 
  hell , i may even host it if nobody else will be willing to !, 
  our glorious alliance shall stand because ** i wo n't be able to attend ** unfortunately . 
  i still want to keep my pretty pink blob though , so i would appreciate if the person who 's going to play as poland ( ? ), 
  respects this and allows me to get back next week . 
  austria-hungay 2.0 - now with more internal instability !, 
  holy shit . 
  ai did it . 
  ai really did it . 
  ** ai made poland major again . 
   i know it probably wo n't make a huge difference it wo n't . 
  it never does . 
  still ... 
  ** signed . 
   should you miss 2 sessions , someone can claim your nation in the second session , so keep that in mind . 
  that 's unfortunate . 
  i ( poland ) will most likely ** not be able to attend this session ** . 
  i want to continue playing as poland in the future though . 
  ** if anyone would like to play as poland tomorrow please pm me . 
  ** just saying . 
  also what happens if someone misses two sessions ? 
  does one still have a right/claim to his country ? 
  ** what is poland may never die but rises again , harder and stronker ** here are the pretty maps ( tm ) : ** [ political map \\ ( 1470 \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8mgwikt.png ) ** [ ** the war of german agression ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j5wv4ey.png ) ** bonus image :[ glorious battle of ratibor against the german invaders ] ( http://i.imgur.com/45ajkku.jpg ) ** also it is possible i wo n't be able to show up next week , so if somebody would like to fill in please let me know via pm . 
  ** polen ** !, 
   if it looks like a bunch of normal players are gone due to me fucking up with the post , we 'll just put it off till next week . 
   been talking with a few other players , and i 'm gon na go ahead and host a new game with the new patch . 
  yes please !, 
  okay , since yesterday things did n't go well for ... reasons , ** i 'll be probably switching from poland to lithuania ** from next session forward . 
  before i do this i would like to know whether lithuania is currently unclaimed - is it ? 
  i may come back actually . 
  i had a rough week and wanted to play some eu4 relax but when my plan for the campaign was shattered before it even started and my whole army got stackwiped by fucking ai i just rq  _ <, 
  [ me right now .

  you were supposed to destroy the protestants , not join them !, 
  frankly i do n't know , i never used it :p anyone here has experience with this ? 
  you have my sword . 
  ** suggestions ** 1 . 
  ** random new world ** - shall we give it a try ? 
  ** patch 1.17 ** - will come out next week probably , are we sure it wo n't cause compatibility problems ? 
  or are we just going to continue in 1.16.3 ? 
  ** aliances ** - dip relations cap minus 1 seems like a reasonable solution ; i agree with / u/rhaktor that it will make dip ideas more valuable ( or rather less useless ) . 
  ** surrendering ** - will we be using unconditional surrender option introduced in 1.16 in place of the usual `` i surrender '' rule ? 
  ** religious league war ** - please make a rule so that nobody can dow and start league war until 1 year has passed since the leagues are enabled . 
  the last one was such a dissapointment - it 's supposed to be a huge continent-spanning war !, 
  also i suggest redacting the wall of text posted by op - it 's way too long and may act as deterrent for new possible players . 
   included / u/czokletmuss claim to poland since he called dibs on it in the end thread of the last playthrough . 
  ** i am into make confirm that will play be as polan . 
  ** thanks for taking note of my claim btw , 
   now it has 3 of them . 
  it 's getting out of hand !, 
  *** diplomacy intensifies ***, 
  holy shit . 
  take my updoot . 
  not a surprise that he 's a dick to our politicians . 
   says women are stupid and should be paid less  does n't get paid because says stupid stuff consistency !, 
  ** itt triggered muricans defending their shitty country .
