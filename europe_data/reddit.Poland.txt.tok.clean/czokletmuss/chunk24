   the falklands you mean malvinas ? 
  they can always become , you know , ** immigrants ** and try to obtain ciitzenship in one of the member states - buy a real estate , learn language , pass exams and so on . 
  no need to make it easy for ** british immigrants ** who themselves are * against * immigration . 
   by most estimates about 20-25 % of the entire population died . 
  among men , the corresponding number approached 50 % . 
  just think of how insane these numbers are for a second . 
  these are also the losses poland sustained during ww2 ( c.20-25 % ) . 
  now witness the power of this fully armed and operational husaria brigade . 
  ** make plc great again **, 
  i live here and i like it . 
  anglo-saxons really lost their goddamn mind in 2016 . 
  not for long - after england leaves the single market it wo n't take long before its economy collapses . 
  better to leave the sinking ship of the uk as soon as possible . 
  time to liberate scotland from english opression . 
   rubs back of head nervously lemma ask you sumthin ' . 
  i can see some snow in granada though . 
  it was a genocide . 
  having said that , i wonder when ukraine will recognize volhynian massacre as genocide . 
  he does n't - feels over reals , man . 
  -- do you know how the muricans first came into being ? 
  they were english once . 
  taken by the corporate powers . 
  tortured , and mutilated . 
  a ruined and terrible form of life . 
  and now ... perfected .

  inb4 tankies : it was state capitalism ussr did nothing wrong reeeeeeee, 
  you are correct but i think that there is zero chance of poland doing anything against ukraine nowadays . 
  plus nobody thinks about `` rightful polish clay '' apart from a bunch of neo-nazis ( maybe a thousand or two per 38 mln citizens ) - it 's just a joke . 
  if you are offended i 'm sorry mate . 
  i guess today you ca n't just not use '' / s '' .

   endless , useless arguments on issues so complicated that all the politicians and experts of this world do n't know how to resolve them ... given to redditors who seem to vote only by feels . 
  that 's reddit for you !, 
  or any other forum for non-professsionals . 
  rajoy must create a grand army of the ~ ~ republic ~ ~ kingdom to counter the increasing threats of the separatists . 
  yes - everyone who 's not a bigoted moron is usually banned from td after a couple of posts .

   oh , nooooo poland is showing signs of ... an independent external policy . 
  sucking us dick is not independent external policy . 
   the polish government is also saying the forest was `` illegally '' added to the unesco world heritage list . 
  whatever that means . 
  it 's just a talking point for pis voters , it has no meaning beyond `` previously ruling party bad , we good '' . 
  polan stronk , we no need no immigrants or silly eurogay eu ( but gib monies plox ) . 
  you are just a filthy polonophobe who hates proud independent poland . 
   entitled to enjoy the free shit . 
  b-but muh ww2 reperations reeeeeeeeeee / s, 
  new deus ex looks pretty good . 
  pretty important statements made during pis convention :  poland has a moral right to say ` no ' to refugees , the country 's most powerful politician said on saturday . 
   jaroslaw kaczynski , head of the ruling party law and justice ( pis ) , gave his views on immigration at a party convention in przysucha , 100 km ( 60 miles ) south of warsaw . 
   ** `` we have not exploited the countries from which these refugees are coming to europe these days , we have not used their labor force and finally we have not invited them to europe . 
  we have a full moral right to say ` no ' , '' kaczynski said in a speech broadcast on television . 
  **  last month the european commission launched a legal case against poland , hungary and the czech republic for refusing to take in asylum seekers , highlighting the feud within the 28-nation bloc over how to deal with migration . 
   kaczynski , who has criticized the european union 's relocation schemes for migrants on many occasions , also said that the pis could not be accused of being anti-european , as it backed poland 's joining the block in 2004 and now appreciates the inflow of eu funds . 
   ** `` the fact that we appreciate them ( the funds ) , does not mean that we have lost the right to various assessments , including those regarding the historical context , '' kaczynski said , adding that poland has never received any compensation for the losses it suffered during the second world war . 
  **  during his 70-minute speech , the pis leader suggested the government increase social spending if the economic situation allows . 
  he also said there was a need to reduce the share of foreign capital in the media sector . 
  not that hard really . 
  barbaric customs like ( not-medical ) circumcision does not belong here in europe . 
  jesus , turkey is becoming as backward as the us !, 
  big if true !, 
  always - as in since the moment uk joined the ec in 1973 - the uk was opposing further integration . 
  the ww2 has nothing to do with what i 'm talking about and you know it . 
   money we have spent on poland top net contributors to eu budget are germany , france , italy , uk and spain , whereas uk and spain spend a similiar amount of money - but i 've never saw a spaniard or italian talking about `` his '' money being spent by evil eu on eastern europe . 
   polands been doing fine as a medium sized country for most of its history . 
  `` fine '' ? 
  do you even know polish history ? 
   why is it different now ? 
  why things change with time ? 
  `` m'doctor , thank you for your service * tips * '', 
  you are correct but honestly i do n't see any alternative . 
   circumcision is not just a mutilation or whatever you want to call it . 
  cutting parts of babies for reasons other than medical is child abuse and violation of human rights . 
  parents should not be able to do this , just like they should not be allowed to beat the shit out of their child . 
  i agree that it can be performed for medical reasons but let 's be honest , this is not what the discussion on ban is about . 
  the only alternative to integration is desintegration and europe becoming a playing field for us , russia and china . 
  a surprise , to be sure , but a welcome one . 
   male circumcision is ` violation of bodily integrity ' and should be banned inb4 americans : i was mutilated by my parents without having any choice on this but that 's okay do n't tread on me reeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  bloody wankers have always caused problems and stood in the way of further integration . 
  they wanted brexit , they may have it - it 's not our fault that they do n't know why , what for or how are they going to quit the union . 
  having said that i believe that lord buckethead will negotiate terms agreeable for both parties .
