  is this because of this le megathread concerning the terrorist attack in france ? 
  as some of you may know , recently new president took office in poland . 
  since the parliamentary elections are only c. 2,5 months from now , both main parties - liberal-conservative civic platform and conservative law and justice - are very eager to throw accusations . 
  the new president is from law and justice and it 's fair to say that he is a deeply believing catholic . 
  recently there was a discussion in the media about the separation of church and state in poland or rather about the lack of it . 
  liberal media are critisicing catholic church for loudly opposing new bill on in vitro , while conservative media defend the right of the church to express its opinions - you know , the usual . 
  what i 'm curious about is how the separation of religion and state works ** in practice ** in your country . 
  since poland is a catholic country , i 'm especially interested in opinions of citizens of , say , spain , italy or ireland . 
  with recent developments in ukraine and georgia i think it 's obvious that there should be some discussion on how to ensure safety for eu member states from foreign agression . 
  nato is not eternal , it will exist as long as its convenient for all its members . 
  in international relations everything can change pretty quickly - like for example us-china relations changed during nixon administranion or like west-russia relation changed during the past 5 years . 
  it would be foolish to take anyone 's guarantees as immutable . 
  russian neighbors in eastern , central and northern europe should cooperate closely regardless of nato and treaties with us . 
  let 's take estonia for example . 
  as discussed [ in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hk35u/estonian_border_officer_kidnapped_by_russian/ ) , recently estonian citizen and employee of estonian internal security service was sentenced by pskov court to 15 years in prison after being kidnapped by russian . 
  this makes one wonder why this happened in the first place and what should be the proper response to this . 
  some say that estonia should n't fear anything because it 's a nato state and thus will never be invaded . 
  this is true but is it really * invasion * what is a real threat to baltics , finland or other russian neighbors ? 
  here 's one scenario which may potentially happen :  the russian minority will demand more and more privileges , crying persecution and complaininig about being opressed , of which russia will be very concerned . 
  in due time the russian minority may organize itself and openly demand autonomy while eu and nato will pretend that they do n't know where funding and directions come from . 
  in time there may be some acts of violence which will further polarize public opinion , some `` nationalists '' attacking poor russian minority . 
  pressure from russia and internal turmoil will increase and at some point `` local milita '' may form . 
  then russia will announce that attack on `` local militia '' would be attack on russian citizens and thus the russian government would have to answer to this with using all means necessary . 
  there will be no invasion - [ salami tactics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salami_tactics ) worked great so far in every case . 
  i fear that the baltics may be the next target after ukraine and georgia . 
  does anyone remember [ 2007 cyber attacks on estonian infrastructure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) after disagreement with russia regarding bronze soldier of tallinn ( controversial war memorial from soviet era ) ? ], 
  let 's be honest , estonia and other baltic states are small countries with huge russian minorities and for someone in london , paris or washington not worthy bleeding and dying for . 
  if we as an eastern flank of nato want to feel safe , we have to take initiative . 
  i hope that [ our new president 's first foreign trip to tallin ] ( http://www.baltictimes.com/duda_will_make_estonia_his_first_foreign_trip_as_polish_president/ ) is the beginning of some regional initative in this direction . 
  after all we all have suffered from russian occupation and we have common interest in keeping russians on their side of the border . 
  i used russia as an example because today it 's the only real military threat to eu . 
  the problem is bigger than that obviously . 
  we do n't know what future will bring and unlike usa we 're not protected by two oceans . 
  so how can we defend ourselves or undertake military operations overseas if needed ? 
  let 's not forget how the last intervention of eu member states ended :  libya has been ** a war in which some of the atlantic alliance 's mightiest members did not participate , or did not participate with combat aircraft , ** like spain and turkey . 
  it has been a war where the danes and norwegians did an extraordinary number of the combat sorties , given their size . 
  their planes and pilots became exhausted , as the french finally pulled back their sole nuclear-powered aircraft carrier for overdue repairs and italy withdrew its aircraft carrier to save money . 
   ** only eight of the 28 allies engaged in combat , and most ran out of ammunition , having to buy , at cost , ammunition stockpiled by the united states . 
  ** germany refused to take part , even in setting up a no-fly zone . 
   although washington took a back seat in the war , which the obama administration looked at skeptically from the start , the united states still ran the initial stages , in particular the destruction of libya 's air defenses , making it safe for its nato colleagues to fly . 
  ** the united states then provided intelligence , refueling and more precision bombing than paris or london want to acknowledge . 
  **  ( ... )  the question , however , is whether european members of nato will ever decide to embark on such an adventure again . 
   ** either europeans will develop the security and defense identity they have advertised for so long , so europe can have its own credible voice in a world not only run by soft power , or given the expense and difficulties of defeating even libya , they will simply stop trying . 
  ** the jury is out , but the verdict is important .

  i found an interesting article ( for a lack of better word ) on consequences of global warming on europe :  ** high temperatures **  global warming will have serious consequences for human health , biodiversity , ecosystems and the goods and services they provide , as well as for many social and economic sectors , including agriculture , tourism , and energy production . 
   more frequent high-temperature extremes , such as hot days and nights and heat waves , as observed and projected , will affect human health . 
  ** this could lead to an increase in the cases of temperature-related mortality , as already experienced in recent heat events . 
  especially vulnerable sectors of the population , such as the elderly and infants , will be affected the most . 
  **  warming is affecting the distribution and abundance of many plant and animal species ( insects , birds ) , which already show problems in adapting to the changing climate . 
  mountain areas are particularly affected . 
  the behaviour and phenology of animal and plant species is also changing : this could lead to greater numbers of pests , invasive species , and the incidence of certain human diseases , while the yields and the viability of agriculture and livestock , or the capacity of ecosystems to provide key services and goods ( such as water reservoirs , natural erosion control ) could be diminished . 
   warmer temperatures increase the risk of desertification in southern parts of europe , and they also cause a greater risk of droughts . 
  temperature extremes will therefore affect sectors such as agriculture , tourism and energy production . 
  cities can face new challenges for supply of water and other basic resources . 
  low-temperature extremes ( cold spells , frosty days ) could become less frequent in europe , and milder winter temperatures might also reduce winter deaths . 
  however , global warming affects the predictability of events and therefore our response capacity . 
   ** water availability **  climate change is expected to affect water availability and increase water scarcity throughout europe . 
  changes have been observed in river flows , with reductions in southern and eastern europe , and increases or seasonal changes in other regions . 
   with fresh water originating mostly in mountain areas ( e.g. 
  ** 40 % of europe 's water comes from the alps ** ) , changes in the snow and glacier dynamics and in precipitation patterns ** may lead to water shortages across europe . 
  these diminishing water supplies will also have a negative impact on hydroelectric power ** , which is the principal energy source for large areas of europe . 
   water scarcity , together with other climate change effects such as droughts , will have a direct impact on citizens , especially in highly urbanised or densely populated areas and the coast . 
  changes in water availability and quality will affect critical eu sectors such as tourism , agriculture , industry , energy , and transport . 
  environmental effects are expected to affect biodiversity , water quality , and aggravate the risk of forest fires , soil degradation and desertification . 
   ** floods , droughts , landslides and other effects **  in most of europe , less precipitation in summer and rising temperatures will lead to more frequent and intense summer droughts . 
  ** the mediterranean region is already experiencing these effects , and is expected to suffer from more extreme droughts in the coming decades , together with other regions , such as central europe . 
  **  greater droughts , heat waves and dry spells across most of the mediterranean region will increase the length and severity of the fire season , the area at risk and the probability of large fires , possibly enhancing desertification . 
  locations currently not prone to fires could experience this catastrophic hazard and become risk areas . 
   climate change will increase the chances of flooding in some regions of europe . 
  ** flood damage is expected to rise across europe . 
  ** meanwhile , some north-eastern parts will become less flood-prone due to a reduction in snow accumulation . 
   river floods are a common natural disaster in europe , and along with storms have resulted in fatalities , affected millions of people and delivered massive direct economic losses in the last three decades . 
  climate change is likely to increase the occurrence and frequency of flooding across europe in the coming years . 
   heavy rainstorms are projected to become more common and more intense due to warmer temperatures . 
  ** flash floods and pluvial floods ** , triggered by local intense precipitation events , ** are expected to become more frequent throughout europe . 
  **  in some regions , certain risks , such as early spring floods due to reduced snow accumulation during winter , could decrease in the short term , but new risks associated with climate change may offset positive effects in the medium term . 
   ** sea-level rise and coastal areas **  sea level has been rising over the 20th century , and the tendency has accelerated in recent decades . 
  this is due mostly to thermal expansion of the oceans as a result of warming , but also to extra water addition due to melting ice . 
  as global temperatures rise , coasts will become more vulnerable to flooding and erosion . 
   around a third of the eu population lives within 50km of the coast and these areas generate over 30 % of the union 's total gdp . 
  ** the economic value of assets within 500m of europe 's seas totals between $ 500-1 ,000 billion **  sea-level rise , together with other projected effects of climate change such as changes in the dynamics and energy distribution of waters or on the frequency and intensity of storm surges will increase the risk of flooding and erosion in coastal areas , with significant consequences for the people , infrastructure , businesses and nature in these areas . 
   among other potential impacts , ** sea-level rise is projected to reduce the amount of available freshwater , as sea water pushes further into underground water-tables ** ; it will likely lead also to much more saltwater intrusion into freshwater habitats , affecting biodiversity and the services and goods that coastal areas provide . 
  many wetlands areas will be lost , threatening unique bird and plant species . 
   there is a greater risk of flash flooding in mountain areas and their downstream valleys as a higher proportion of precipitation flows straight into river systems .
