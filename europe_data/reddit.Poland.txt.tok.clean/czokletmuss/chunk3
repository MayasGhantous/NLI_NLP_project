  yeah but in the end authority of the consitution is based on will of the people ( nation ) . 
  so if say 75 % vote against this would be a powerful argument against ever joining the eurozone . 
  i 'm glad that referendums became more popular among the politicians . 
  i see what duda wants to achieve - if the nations says `` no '' then it would be a great argument against joining eurozone . 
  however poland is already obliged to join the eurozone as per the accession treaty . 
  so the question is what should polish government do if people vote `` no '' when the obligation to join eurozone is binding ? 
  of course this matters only in case there is sufficient turnout - as per polish constitution :  article 125  1 . 
  a nationwide referendum may be held in respect of matters of particular importance to the state . 
  the right to order a nationwide referendum shall be vested in the sejm , to be taken by an absolute majority of votes in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of deputies , or in the president of the republic with the consent of the senate given by an absolute majority vote taken in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of senators . 
  ** a result of a nationwide referendum shall be binding , if more than half of the number of those having the right to vote have participated in it . 
  the validity of a nationwide referendum and the referendum referred to in article 235 , para . 
  6 , shall be determined by the supreme court . 
  the principles of and procedures for the holding of a referendum shall be specified by statute . 
   it 's ridiculous how you use the term refugees and immigrants interchangeably . 
  today it seems that the difference is purely political .

  `` witty quote does n't prove anything '' - jesus christ , 1876, 
   but culture wise they are definitely scandinavian . 
  that 's what i was trying to say . 
  poland or czechoslovakia or eastern germany were n't parts of the ussr either . 
  you know , the whole west-east division was used to describe state of affairs during the cold war . 
  nowadays it is n't really that useful considering how much changed during the past 25 years . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that if finland is considered western despite being part of russian empire for over 100 years and later under soviet influence , then basically whole central europe can be considered western too and the whole division stops making any sense . 
  well they are scandinavian but as far as being part of western europe goes i would n't be so sure . 
  no , we 're jealous of spain or uk or germany or france or perhaps sweden . 
  finland not so much . 
  so you are saying that germany is only half-western country ? 
  good read , thanks for the link !, 
  winter war myth again ? 
  finland lost this war you know - it was n't completely crushed but it lost after all . 
  hear , hear !, 
  [ ahem . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_duchy_of_finland ) you were part of russia for a quite a long time and after ww2 de facto soviet protectorate . 
  does n't this make you part of eastern europe ? 
   us westerners  finland are n't you guys in eastern europe ?

  ftfy, 
  this always bothered me . 
  it 's not the 80s folks , we have this thing called the internet where you can always check your facts before , you know , publishing them for millions to read/view . 
  i would understand if it was american medium but it 's germany and the country in question lies in europe for crying out loud . 
  why this keeps happening ? 
   poland 35  spain 37 great success !, 
  but seriously , we have less corruption than in espana ? 
  i guess all this scandals with politicians taking bribes in andalucia and other ccaa must have really made their impact . 
   it would simply be much lower than one in france or germany . 
  but then what 's the point ? 
  who 's going to pay pension for every citizen if there are problems with financing current welfare system ? 
  i do n't know about france but in poland we have a big gap in the budget between income and expenses ( hence the ever-increasing debt ) and a huge chunk of the budget is spent on pensions and healthcare already . 
  assuming basic income would be , say , 1000 pln/month that 's c. 36 mln citizens * 1000 pln = 3,6 bln pln per month . 
  this is c. 1 bln eur per month or 12 bln eur per year . 
  currently our deficit for 2016 is planned to be equal to pln 54.6 billion ( eur 12.9 billion ) . 
  13 billion of current deficit versus c. 12 bln ( cost of the implementation of the basic income system ) . 
  ** basic income would double our deficit ** - and it 's not like 1000 pln is enough to live for a month . 
  this would bankrupt the state pretty quickly . 
  explain to me how this is a good idea . 
  rich states with small population ( switzerland , norway ) perhaps can implement this - hell , it even exists today in some of the persian gulf countries with citizens getting oil money from the government . 
  but in vast majority of countries in the world this is simply not possible . 
  basic income is just another dream conceived in the first world with no respect to reality . 
  considering demographic issues in whole europe , the basic income is simply not economically viable . 
  i get why the idea sounds attractive but it makes little sense . 
  it 's about time . 
  good luck resisting your government which has you under constant surveillance and can have you detained indefinitely . 
  in case of `` armed insurrection '' against washington ( although this is a bizarre idea to start with ) common people stand no chance against most powerful military in the world . 
  and are you seriously comparing guerilla warfare in third world countries invaded by us to bunch of gun-totting americans hypothetically resisting their own government ? 
  i do n't see what american independence war has to do with this either , it 's not 18th century anymore . 
  this really is a weird way to support right to carry guns . 
  is this one of the reasons nra uses to lobby in congress against gun control ? 
   fundamental distinction between a free people and servile people oh lord ... are you serious ?

  by the end of the century we will reach 4 degrees c rise in temperature :  assessments of recent trends and `` current policies '' in the world 's energy system analyzed by the international energy agency in its world energy outlook 2012 indicate global-mean warming above pre-industrial levels would approach ** 3.8 \u00b0 c by 2100 . 
  ** another assessment , by climate action tracker , of these trends and policies leads to a warming of 3.7 \u00b0 c , about 0.6 \u00b0 c higher than the median estimate of the effect of the copenhagen pledges in this assessment . 
  as a consequence , it is projected on the basis of these assessments that under recent trends and current policies there is about a ** 40 percent chance of exceeding 4 \u00b0 c by 2100 and a 10 percent risk of exceeding 5 \u00b0 c. 
  **  based on a sample of 114 energy-economic model scenarios estimating emissions in the absence of further substantial policy action ( baseline scenarios ) , climate-model projections reach a ** warming of 4.0 -- 5.2 \u00b0 c above pre-industrial levels by 2100 ** ( 95 percent range of scenarios -- grey shaded area figure 2.1 ) ( blanford et al. 
  only under extreme assumptions regarding autonomous improvements leading to large decreases in energy intensity and an energy demand by 2100 ( e.g. , 35 -- 40 percent lower than under default assumptions ) ( blanford et al. 
  2014 ) does the lower end of the baselines ' 95 percent range decrease to below 4 \u00b0 c ( 3.5 \u00b0 c ) in 2100 . 
   the ipcc working group iii fifth assessment report assessment of baseline scenarios leads to a ** warming of 3.7 -- 4.8 \u00b0 c by 2100 ** ( 80 percent range of scenarios ; 2.5 -- 7.8 \u00b0 c including climate-system uncertainty ) , which includes the scenarios with assumptions on autonomous improvements in energy intensity . 
  in relation to the effects of pledges , the updated unep emissions gap assessment 2013 ( unep 2013 ) assessed present emissions trends and pledges . 
  global emissions estimated for 2020 are consistent with emissions pathways that reach ** warming in the range of 3 -- 5 \u00b0 c by 2100 ** and are closest to levels consistent with pathways leading to 3.5 -- 4 \u00b0 c warming by 2100 .

   say what you will , but numbers do have a very tangible power , and in a world where more than 80 % of the world population will live in asia and africa , europe 's global clout will be reduced almost by default . 
  that 's the defualt situation - europe and her former colonies ( aka the west ) only become the leading power in late 18th-early 19th century . 
  for centuries the center of the world was in china and india and before that in the middle east .
