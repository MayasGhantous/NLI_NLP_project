  i 'm talking about , say , poland enacting law forbidding doing business with catalonia or something to that effect in order to please our nato ally . 
  this does n't mean poland would n't send some necessary equipment or specialized teams ( medicine , food , doctors ) to help spain deal with the situation . 
  usually when it comes to secession things get ugly . 
  alright . 
  if you could give me some good links ( in english or spanish ) so that i can read more about the whole issue it would be great , 
   we are already independent in strategic and economic resources , for example . 
  today - the situation would change drastically after the declaration . 
   what law ? 
  the spanish law ? 
  do you understand what independent means ? 
  i do . 
  do you understand what `` international recognition '' means ? 
  from spanish point of view your independence would be an unlawful secession and violation of constitution and the government will react accordingly . 
  without being recognized catalonia 's independence would be on paper only . 
  you can just as well declare independence of your own apartment . 
  why do you keep talking about the army ? 
  madrid does n't need army to enforce the law . 
  thanks for the link , interesting read . 
  spanish army could do this but it would n't - sending police and cutting you off from access to the electrical grid and other infrastructure plus isolating you diplomatically would suffice . 
   if we 're independent it 's pretty clear that we wo n't give a shit about your constitution . 
  i mean , we 're already violating it right now with these elections for fucks sake !, 
  then those responsible should be punished for breaking the law . 
  well you should . 
  madrid has army , allies , critical infrastructure and is a member of eu , nato , un , esa and a party to dozens of international treaties . 
  catalonia has nothing like this and what it has is not absolutely not comparable . 
  btw , why exactly do you want independence ? 
  you are not opressed by the government like , say , batlics were by ussr . 
  what do you have to gain ? 
  well , it depends . 
  after declaration of independence the spanish government would do everything to force catalonia to comply by freezing their assets and using diplomatic leverage to stop other countries from doing business with catalonia . 
  when people lose income and become hungry using violence is not out of the question . 
  in worst case using military to secure strategic locations is possible - do n't forget that catalonia uses spanish infrastructure providing water , electricity , natural gas etc. 
  madrid can use this as leverage . 
  if it comes to this personally i hope that polish government will side with spain . 
  our interest is in strong nato which spain is a member of - we have nothing to gain by supporting catalonia . 
  i can feel sympathy to catalans but imho it would be in national interest of poland to strongly support spain . 
  if forced to choose between spain and catalonia as a trading partner , vast majority of eu members will choose spain . 
  you keep talking about democracy but you forget that in other countries there are also democratic governments who have to act in best interest of their citizens . 
  nobody would risk economic and diplomatic relations with spain in order to trade with some small province . 
  have you read article 4 ? 
   the parties ** will consult ** together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the ** territorial integrity ** , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened . 
  consultations are absolutely possible . 
  good luck with self-determinating yourself from a government which is adamant on preserving integrity of the state . 
  as for your examples - eastern europe and baltics happened during dissolution and collapse of ussr and situation of norway and iceland is n't really comparable to catalunya . 
  * gibmoney . 
  that 's wishful thinking . 
  if you think france or germany would support rebellion instead of their ally than you are mistaken . 
  but spain does n't have to : - one of comunidades autonomas violates the constitution - madrid takes appropriate actions - ca disobeys - madrid sends police that 's it . 
  there wo n't be military action because in case it happens catalunya would lose 100 % . 
  i 'm sure you guys realize this . 
   no , you do it by having a majority that votes to do so . 
  rest of spain  catalunya you ca n't just secede from a country like that . 
  i do n't recall any example in history with outcome you desire ( peaceful unilateral secession ) . 
  i ca n't agree . 
  there is 99,9 % chance that things will never escalate so badly that nato help would be needed . 
  however , in case of catalan rebellion from a legal point of view spain could use article 4 . 
  it 's conceivable although very improbable . 
  if spain invokes article 4 of nato :  the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened . 
  you can be assured that poland will answer . 
  you do not become a country simply by declaring independence . 
  if nobody recognizes catalunya it would be nothing more than rebellion , in which case spain can use police on its own territory to ensure that spanish law is enforced . 
   if they dare shot a single bullet every country in the eu will recognise us . 
  i would n't be so sure about this - quite the contrary in fact . 
  spain is a recognized country and member of eu and nato , not to mention that every other country facing potential problems with separatist movements ( like italy with venice ) would surely support spain . 
   law which we wo n't be abiding by . 
  which in this case would be a crime mind you . 
  the government does n't have to send the army , they may just send the police and they probably would in worst case scenario . 
  spain has allies , you know . 
  and despite spanish army being not that big sending 10,000 troops to barcelona to enforce law would be enough . 
  it 's not like catalunya can oppose madrid . 
  well there is article 155 of [ spanish constitution ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/constitucion.php ) :  art\u00edculo 155 . 
  imho it would be definitely illegal to declare independence and spanish government can use take `` necessary actions '' to make sure that catalunya complies with the constitution . 
  i 'm not talking about blood in the streets . 
  i 'm reading codigo penal at the moment and i ca n't find it but i 'm pretty sure that declaration of indepedence is a crime according to spanish law . 
  what would stop madrid from sending police to arrest those suspected of breaking the law ? 
  is n't unilateral declaration of independence basically rebellion leading to civil war ?

  do you mean notation for things like implication , negation , disjunction etc. 
   veritable font of logic u wot  how it is the responsibility and duty of the wealthy countries of europe to fix the world 's problems ?

   can anyone , with a straight face , tell me there are n't the clear indications we will face a wave of millions or tens of millions willing to come to europe , to escape the effects of climate change , of overpopulation , of poverty and of the inevitable civil strifes resulting from the above ? 
  nope . 
  these are the facts and we have to deal with it . 
  luckily we can count on our political class to ignore it as long as possible and then choose the worst possible solution .
