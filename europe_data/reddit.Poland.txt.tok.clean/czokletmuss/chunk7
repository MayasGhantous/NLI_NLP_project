  georgia -  anti-russian anti-russian -  pals seriously though : small country with very rich history and geopolitical location even worse than this of poland . 
  great wines , fantastic landscapes , big political challenges ( war with russia , osetia and abkhazia , potential nato and eu member ) and unique georgian script . 
  also iosif vissarianovich jughashvili aka stalin . 
  i wish you guys best luck !, 
  so what impact ukexit would have on rest on the union ? 
  this is n't an opinion , rising sea level is [ a fact ] ( http://phys.org/news/2015-08-nasa-unavoidable-sea.html ) . 
  here 's an opinion though : how do you imagine reducing emissions , spending billions on investements in renewables , preparing infrastructure for sea level rise and accomodating millions of people dispaced due to climate change simultaneously ? 
  the transition , if it were to ever happen , would hurt economically everyone - corporations , politicians , common people . 
  and nobody will lift a finger until some major disaster happens and it will be too late . 
  i 'm afraid it 's too little too late . 
  [ the ocean level will rise over 3m this century , perhaps even more . 
  ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sea-level-could-rise-at-least-6-meters/ ) there 's nothing we can do to stop this really . 
  thanks !, 
   highly disturbing footage 's of violent muslims rampaging through paris . 
  as you can see the police only keep the scum at bay , letting them destroy everything on their way . 
  the socialist are colluding with the muslims , what are are seeing now is a second french revolution . 
  its about to be a bloodbath , unless people take action they will be the next target . 
  great , another racist . 
  where are you guys coming from ? 
  consumption is the main problem . 
  the united states alone , with less than 5 % of the global population , uses about a quarter of the world 's fossil fuel resources burning up nearly 25 % of the coal , 26 % of the oil , and 27 % of the world 's natural gas . 
  if usa was to magically disappear overnight the rest of the world would have much more resources . 
  the same goes for europe . 
  obviously this ca n't happen and with rapid industralization in the third world and thus increasing co2 emissions , fossil fuels consumption , demand for electricty etc. 
  i do n't see how things can possibly improve . 
   i masturbate furiously over the newest fertility stats errr ...  unfortunately africa is set to wipe out all of that population reduction progress , we really need to focus on reducing their fertility rates . 
  so you are suggesting ... what exactly ? 
  forced sterilization ? 
  education ? 
  the main factor contributing to fertility rates is poverty but more developed world is a world consuming more resources and emitting even more co2 . 
   also , lithuanians fired on their own , stalin did nothing wrong , you should be grateful that soviets liberated you , they built you roads and factories . 
  ungrateful savages , do n't you know that russians not only civilised you but also bled for your freedom ? 
  and yet you turn away from them to serve the corrupt west . 
  shame !, 
  what is this `` rugby '' you are speaking of ? 
  i thought this series already premiered in ukraine two years ago . 
  so country which was a member of nazi-soviet alliance wants nazi gold , eh ? 
  good luck with that . 
  central europe central europe central europe central europe central europe central europe finally some recognition !, 
  err you do realize that i was joking , right ? 
  luckily in such case the government decides , not the public opinion in referendum or something like this . 
  here 's some [ uplifting watching/reading for you . 
  ] ( http://m.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2014/11/climate-desk-fact-checks-aaron-sorkins-climate-science-newsroom ) if we disrupt the biosphere as bad as we can , people with guns will be your last problem . 
  ** [ sorry but we 'll never be that desperate to ask portugal out of all countries for help . 
   it always amazes me when countries gorillion kilometers from russia talk about russia the brits are the best at this . 
  `` why are you afraid of russia ? 
  i live on british isles and i 'm not afraid . 
  i know the front line has passed through your countries several times during ww1 and ww2 but come on , what 's the worst that can happen ? 
  it 's not like russia would do what it has been doing for the past 200 years . '', 
  `` i 'm from portugal which lies over 4000 km from russian border and has virtually zero historical experience in dealing with russia , so let 's me tell you how you should deal with state which has been invading and occupying your country for the past 200 years . '', 
  actually you are correct - i should 've said that usa is turning into another russia . 
  we 're about to face major challenges arising from demographics , welfare state crisis , global warming , depletion of natural resources ( fish , cheap minerals and fossil fuels ) and apparently the immigrant issue as well . 
  on top of that we 're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction , this time caused by humans . 
  there is no hope for better tomorrow in [ anthropocene . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthropocene ), 
  let 's see : - kidnapped [ check ] - detained illegally [ check ] - ~ ~ torture ~ ~ inhanced interrogation [ check ] - sentenced [ check ] - no right to appeal [ check ] holy crap , russia is turning into [ another usa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senate_intelligence_committee_report_on_cia_torture ) !, 
  the world ca n't handle so many violations of human rights !, 
   in the battle of kircholm ** we ** defeated the swedish army lol , it seems every nation of the commonwealth claims this victory as its own :d, 
  such is life . 
  yeah , it will take some time before we get over ourselves with the whole vilnius and `` rzeczpospolita = poland '' thing . 
  but i hope that in the future the fact that it was the commonwealth of ** two ** nations will be appreciated more . 
  liberate , you say :  the cursed soldiers ( that is , `` accursed soldiers '' or `` damned soldiers '' ; polish : \u017bo\u0142nierze wykl\u0119ci ) is a name applied to a variety of ** anti-communist polish resistance movements formed in the later stages of world war ii and afterwards . 
  ** created by some members of the polish secret state , these clandestine organizations ** continued their armed struggle against the stalinist government of poland well into the 1950s . 
  ** the guerrilla warfare included an array of military attacks launched against the new communist prisons as well as mbp state security offices , detention facilities for political prisoners , and concentration camps set up across the country . 
  ** most of the polish anti-communist groups ceased to exist in the late 1940s or 1950s , hunted down by mbp security services and nkvd assassination squads . 
  ** however , ** the last known ` cursed soldier ' , j\u00f3zef franczak , was killed in an ambush as late as 1963 ** , almost 20 years after the soviet take-over of poland . 
  this video skips a lot of things - it covers period of c. 900-2010 in 8 minutes , you know . 
  soviet occupation of poland beginning in 1944-1945 is implied though . 
  acknowledged . 
  it 's time to rent some kids !, 
   work why would i want to do that ? 
  who said anything about heterosexual ? 
  it really tied the room together . 
  you better do !, 
  i 'm white , speak english and my home country is culturally very christian while still lagging economically . 
  so where is my money ? 
  i grew tired of immigration threads so here it is - an 8 minute video , depicting the history of poland through animation , prepared by tomasz bagi\u0144ski for the world expo 2010 in shanghai . 
   the film - or to use the platige image studio 's own terminology - `` the special project '' has already been viewed by an estimated 8 million people who visited the polish display . 
  another million viewers came from all four corners of the earth and watched bagi\u0144ski 's masterpiece on youtube.com , among other websites . 
   in his pressbook , tomasz bagi\u0144ski poses the question : `` do viewers who might see this film actually want a lesson in history ? 
  or perhaps a fact sheet ? '', 
  he is then quick to reply : `` not at all . 
  viewers want thrills . 
  surprises . 
  to travel to a different world . 
  to be awed by images and music . 
  emotions . 
  even if they desire knowledge , then they most likely want an inside view into the polish nation and to find out about what differs our country from others '' . 
   for these reasons , the eight-minute film is not a dull lecture listing key dates and events . 
  it is a dynamic story , told in a manner similar to that of a fantasy film ( bagi\u0144ski and platige image have also animated the computer game wied\u017amin '' / `` the witcher ) , taking their cue from facts which are indicated by a date placed in the top right-hand corner of the screen to expound on historical processes - construction , war , destruction , and restoration . 
   the filmmakers did not include every important date , neither did they mention all significant characters - a closer analysis may in fact cause outrage among cultural commentators , some of whom have already accused an animated history of poland of excluding many women significant to poland 's history and even of omitting a key event traditionally highlighted in polish history , the swedish `` deluge '' ( 1655-1660 ) , which entailed the speeding up of the first polish coronation by 25 years ( in the year 1000 the german emperor otto iii presented a crown to boles\u0142aw chrobry , while the actual coronation took place in 1025 ) . 
  these inaccuracies explain the producers ' initial apprehension to release the film in poland . 
  source : http://culture.pl/en/work/an-animated-history-of-poland-tomasz-baginski aside from deluge also the glorious occupation of moscow in 1610 ( and much less glorious retreat in 1612 ) are omitted , as well as the whole polish-muscovite war of 1605-1618 and polish involvement in time of troubles . 
  but the video is packed with dates and events as it is , so it 's understandable . 
  can i become a refugee in germany ? 
  what benefits do you offer ? 
  i was thinking about learning german anyways . 
  let 's be generous and assume that it will be 200k instead of 800k . 
  this still mean 1mln by 2020 in germany alone - and it 's not like the remaining 600k will evaporate , they will go to other eu countries . 
  no real refugee fallacy much ?
