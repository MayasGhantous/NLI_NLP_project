  really . 
  why do we have this summits in the first place than ? 
  to pat each other on the back and smile ? 
  [ yes it will actually . 
  ] ( http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/future-world-s-population-4-charts ) syria = / = middle east . 
  the problem is that the more immigrants come here , the stronger the resentment will be and the more votes will ( far ) right parties get . 
  we 're in for a spiral of violence and intolerance in the next decade or so . 
  we could even call it ... the final solution . 
  but frankly apart from closing borders and sending military to stop the immigrants at all cost - which would be genocide - there is no solution imho . 
  they will continue to arrive here where they can hope for better live . 
  yeah but for how long ? 
  assuming 800k in 2015 and that the number will grow , it will be 4-5mln by 2020 . 
  what then ?

   his english is n't very good , and sometimes you actually need to read the french version to understand what he 's trying to say . 
  so his english is bad and he 's a moderator ? 
  how can he moderate if he can misunderstand what other people wrote ? 
  low quality submission meets low quality moderation . 
  * and that 's why you have to start with your own language . 
  not really . 
  it depends on which subreddit we 're talking about : / r/worldnews , / r/polandball , / r/debatereligion for example are pretty horrible in this regard . 
  it 's not really a problem per se , it 's just something i personally perceive as annoying and ignorant . 
  * aristotle is a philosopher of freedom ? 
  since when ? 
  his works have nothing in common with ideas of the enlightenment . 
  i know what lend-lease was , i 'm just annoyed of the constant stream of bad history regarding allies in ww2 in basically all subreddits . 
  yeah , imagine what would happen if we all started to write like this . 
  oh yes , `` kontroll '' is awesome !, 
   less than 500 remained afaik a species needs at least 2000 specimen to survive due to requirements regarding minimal genetic diversity , so they are basically already extinct . 
  oh and you support franco as well ? 
  holy crap , i hit the jackpot !, 
  it is true . 
  we all know that spaniards are retarded and lazy . 
  why do you think your economy has gone to shit and you lost all your colonies in the past ? 
  it 's a simple fact . 
  have you ever been to / r/murica ? 
  what facts ? 
  this is just your opinion . 
  i can just as well say that all spaniards are `` at the level of mental retardation '' . 
  weather = / = climate . 
   average iq in subsaharan africa is literally at the level of mental retardation . 
  where are these racists coming from ? 
  reported . 
  fair enough , 
   people from the ** uk , belgium , france , spain and portugal especially ** , i wonder how you feel or think about that era of your history . 
  do you think about it , what do they teach you about this era in your schools , do you feel ashamed or something like that and/or do you feel proud ( we ruled the seas , etc ) and even you do n't think about this things , how do you react when you read a novel or watch a film that covers something from this era . 
  no usa ? 
  everyone seems to forget the indian wars , not mention invasions of hawaii , philippines and other examples of good old 19th century imperialism . 
  also no russia ? 
  they did colonize too and they were similiar to the usa in this regard - medium-size country pushing west/east and taking land by force from the natives . 
  leyenda negra is one of the best examples of really bad history mixed with white-washing of british conquest of natives in north america . 
  inb4 americans explaining that d-day ( which happened 3 years after barbarossa and 2 years after stalingrad ) somehow decided the fate of the war . 
  this may be unpopular opinion but toppling dictators in libya and iraq actually caused more issues in the long term ( immigraiton influx and isis ) than solved . 
  so i would say that bombing countries in africa and middle east with no long term plan is not a move in the right direction . 
  [ majority of immigrants are from syria and iraq , you know . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24583286 ), 
   who should i be looking at ? 
  google `` scramble for africa '' , that would be a good start . 
  so you say that there should be consequences to ruthless exploitation of the third world ? 
  but where 's the ~ ~ fun ~ ~ profit in this ? 
   you guys up north make it seem like you 'll take in everyone actually poland has no immigration problem and i think we 've received less than 2000 immigrants in the past year or two . 
  plus according to recent polls over 75 % of population does n't want immigrants . 
  you must be thinking about sweden or germany . 
  hmm , that makes sense . 
  were , there is basically no immigration to poland ( especially high skilled ) , so ... 
   add on top of that the next most massive wave is expected in september . 
  i 've heard estimates of half a million to a million refugees waiting to depart turkey on their way to greece . 
  source ? 
   fact # 1 : the west is partially responsible for the problems in africa . 
  we can go as far back as the colonization and enslavement of africa , or we can jump forward even to the present where western corporations and governments continue to prop up dictators and warlords in africa . 
  what do you mean by `` the west '' ? 
  not all western countries participated in colonization . 
  for the first time in centuries the geopolitical location of poland is advantageous . 
  who would have thought that being a worse place to live than some of our neighbors would come in handy ? 
  joke --  = = = = = = = your head, 
   i would shoot them down to stop them are you from usa by any chance ? 
  what , are you talking about steve ? 
  he 's 12 years old for christ 's sake , it 's about time he becomes independent instead of leeching off his parents !,

  this beer must 've cost him one . 
  million . 
  dollars . 
  it 's complicated . 
  there is a huge literature about this in poland but long story short it was an unusual concurrence of many factors which led to this . 
  it 's kinda like fall of anatolia to the turks after manzikert in this regard . 
  it could be prevented but due to many reasons it happened and permanently crippled the ere . 
   i still do n't understand wtf really happened between 1634 and 1655 , that changed the balance of power so much in the favour of russians and swedes , that when another inevitable war happened with them poland-lithuania was completely crushed this time and the rest 150 years was slow protracted weakening and agony of state , only with rare rays of hope . 
  more people died in plc then in poland during ww2 ( over 6 mln ) . 
  massive population loss , destruction of many cities and castles , hunger , disease , poverty etc. 
  that 's racist . 
   while shouting allu akbar all\u0101hu akbar . 
  learn your * takbir * , citizen !, 
  so when the next bailout is scheduled ? 
   spain : why does n't it annex portugal ? 
  i know right ? 
   poland : hates china . 
  what . 
  you are missing the point i think .
