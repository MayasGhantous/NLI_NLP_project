  let 's take a look on spanish constitution :  art . 
  this is an expression of modern ideas on law based on ideas of enlightement and human rights . 
  in comparison to some of the rules from classic greece or rome the laws of old seem barbaric to us . 
  however , the fragment of melian dialogue i quoted is related to ** international relations ** . 
  there are no binding rules for sovereign countries except those they chose to accept and uphold . 
  this concept is known as [ anarchy in international relations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarchy_%28international_relations%29 ) . 
  if you violate derechos fundamentales in spain you will be penalized for this by the state - which acts through police , courts , penitentiary system etc. 
  but if some country violetes the universal declaration of human rights there is no such institution . 
  there is no `` world police '' or `` world court '' because there are no binding rules . 
  sure , they are international courts but they have jurisdiction only over countries who ** willingly sign the treaty ** giving them such jurisdiction . 
  in other words , if country like usa commits war crimes , tortures prisoners and violates human rights there is nobody to stop them from it ** because they are the strongest country ** . 
  if however albania would do something like this , other countries may enforce some rules * they deem important * on this country , however by doing so they are not doing job of a policeman but vigilante . 
  that 's what this quote is about - ** might makes right ** . 
  this is true and it will remain true forever . 
  in the end all laws are based on state 's capability of using violence against the perpetrator . 
  only because you live in a relatively rich country in eu does n't mean that this universal truth somehow does n't apply . 
  i see . 
  well , it makes sence , maybe you are right . 
  finland has conscription or professional army btw ? 
  what are your opinion on recent developments in georgia and ukraine ? 
  is there any support for joining nato in finland ? 
  i 'm just throwing ideas here , i 'm not an expert in this area but i see no reason to just assume that wo n't work because it may be difficult . 
  you are from gibraltar ? 
  that 's cool - i was there once , awesome place to live !, 
   as for the unified eu military : despite gibraltar issue both uk and spain have cooperated in eu and nato for years , so i doubt this would be a huge obstacle . 
   i do n't think many finns would be keen on giving up any national sovereignty to foreign powers , particularly when it comes to the military . 
  fine , but how are you going to protect yourself ? 
  alone you stand no chance against russia ( and do n't tell me about winter war - it was 80 years ago ) . 
  ask your representative in congress , not me . 
  or [ read this at least . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_foreign_policy_of_the_barack_obama_administration ), 
  because we 're member of nato . 
  yes , because eu army will magically appear the same night when all nato forces dissapear or teleport back to us . 
  we 're talking long-term planning here . 
  err why are you treating me as if i could decide what poland will do ? 
  i 'm just a redditor . 
  * realpolitik . 
  well it would be nice if you could answer to the questions as well . 
   bottom line is we both agree that the eu needs to defend itself and the us should send it 's troops home . 
  yup , we can agree on that i think . 
   i certainly would n't expect them to die for us in a war . 
  are you in the military ? 
  if not your chances of dying for us or its allies are extremely low . 
   why should a stupid and desperate kid sign up knowing he 'd be deployed in your country ? 
  why kids did sign up knowing that they would be deployed in afghanistan or iraq ? 
  did you sign up ? 
  would you sign up ? 
   does poland have the same relationship with the us they did ? 
  and you feel as if you 're entitled to their defense . 
  what do you mean ? 
  what relationship iraq and afghanistan had with us before 9/11 ? 
  you think i am `` entitled '' to defending people living in iraq ? 
  i do n't follow . 
   yes they did die trying to rebuild those nations and in the case of afghanistan to attack those who were responsible for numerous attacks on the us . 
  rebuild iraq after it was invaded by us you mean ? 
  they die during invasion and later fighting against the rebels which started to pop up after us toppled the government and destabilized the whole country . 
  both war in afghanistan and iraq was a complete and expansive failure - no wmd were ever found , the region is more destabilized than it was before and both nations are worse off then they were before . 
   you are expendable as an `` ally . '', 
  oh i know . 
  that 's one of the reasons poland tries to improve it 's military and create some regional military initiative . 
   so you have no answer as to why the people you hate should die for you . 
  if you are talking about soldiers than fighting in the name of their country it 's pretty much their job . 
  if their enlisted it 's not up to them - or do you claim that us soldiers died in iraq and afghanistan because of warm feelings the local population had towards them ? 
  it is far fetched and optimistic but in the long term it may be the only thing which could ensure regional stability . 
  perhaps but it was white house which [ sent us troops to ukraine ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/us-troops-prepare-ukraine-soldiers-russian-onslaught-331906?piano_d=1 ) and [ called for more sanctions against russia ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/16/u-s-basically-says-russia-sanctions-will-go-on-forever/ ) . 
  what you or any other american thinks of this is one thing but what your government does is much more important to russia , poland , eu and all other countries . 
  i 'm more interested in facts and actions than statements and your feelings . 
  btw afaik all of potential presidential nominees from gop are pro-involvment in europe and more decisive actions against russia , perhaps save for paul . 
  it 's rather unlikely that us would become isolationist agan , no matter what are your feelings on this . 
  yeah but the lesson which we can take from that is n't `` using realism in international relations is stupid '' bur rather `` using stupid realism in international relations is stupid '' in my opinion . 
  from my point of view usa is an enemy of our enemy , which makes us allies . 
  you seem to think that this makes us friends . 
  if us has little to gain from its involvement in europe ( especially eastern europe ) then why you are still here ? 
  afaik that 's because nato is useful in containing russia and weak russia is something from which us gains quite a lot . 
  if you want to discuss we can discuss but facts not emotions . 
  what do you mean by stronger ? 
  power projection ? 
  if that 's the case than yes , iraq is weaker . 
  howeer iraq has modern equipment and weaponry and a sizeable , battle-hardened army . 
  they do n't stand a chance against a superpower like usa but i would say they are more or less on par with france , that is in case of a military conflict between only these two countries the result would n't be obvious . 
  actually it 's very realistic in terms of international relations - the athenians were just the weaker party this time . 
  because : 1 ) my personal feelings are irrelevant when we 're talking about our national interest 2 ) our national interest is not to be under russian influence again 3 ) national interest of nato and eu countries is not to allow russia to become a threat again and make former eastern block countries parts of its sphere of influence 4 ) our interests align 5 ) therefore alliance is mutually beneficial usa is an important ally of poland . 
  this does n't change my - granted , mostly negative - opinion on us as a superpower . 
  yup . 
  so why do you care again ? 
  are you looking for material for / r/europeisperfect or / r/shiteuropeanssay ? 
  why are you interested in my personal feelings on this matter ? 
  but muh basic income, 
   what the actual fuck ? 
  so we should only respect human rights and international law when it is convenient ? 
  well duh . 
  have you heard of [ melian dialogue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melian_dialogue ) ? 
  relevant quote :  for ourselves , we shall not trouble you with specious pretenses -- either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the mede , or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done us -- and make a long speech which would not be believed ; and in return we hope that you , instead of thinking to influence us by saying that you did not join the spartans , although their colonists , or that you have done us no wrong , will aim at what is feasible , holding in view the real sentiments of us both ; since you know as well as we do that ** right , as the world goes , is only in question between equals in power , while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must . 
  ** nothing has changed in the past 2500 years . 
  this is probably the most reasonable option - the title of this thread is what it is because i wanted to start discussion . 
  yes we do  let 's hope that it will happen at some point !, 
  good point . 
  imho poland , lietuva , latvia , estonia and scandinavian countries should seriously start thinking about some regional initiative in this regard as well . 
  yes they are , if we look at them one by one . 
  if their militaries were united to some extent , on the other hand ...
