that does n't make them any less of petty , spineless cowards , who are doing their best to make sure they 'll stay in power through disinformation and burning bridges with the eu . 
  tusk will be back in poland , no doubt about that at all . 
  i feel he 's po 's ( main opposition party ) trump card . 
  one of the most successful polish politicians , he was fighting against lech kaczy\u0144ski ( late brother of that fucking cunt jaros\u0142aw who 's ruining things for us now ) and lost the fight for the presidency in a very tight race . 
  because they 're a bunch of petty , spineless cowards who are afraid tusk is going to come back and take the president 's seat after his european tenure . 
  they will do everything to take him down . 
  really ? 
  most poles in poland actually love their country . 
  they just hate the dipshits in our sejm . 
  yes , i knew that . 
  but the hundreds of millions of people around the world know the town only from auschwitz , so it 's a symbol of o\u015bwi\u0119cim to them . 
  does it mean we have to destroy auschwitz so that the castle is its symbol again ? 
  also , whatever was in the place of the palace before surely was n't the symbol of warsaw either . 
  and i do n't see how having a building reminding us of our tragic past is bad . 
  unless you want to pretend the soviet occupation of our country did n't happen ? 
  we keep those kinds of monuments as a reminder . 
  do you want auschwitz destroyed too ? 
  it 's done more harm than the palace . 
  it is , speaking from a polish perspective . 
  i wish we were more diverse . 
  but the genetics are all over the place here , so that 's good !, 
  of course , we 're long standing allies . 
  there 's even a verse about italy in our national anthem ( z ziemi w\u0142oskiej do polski - from italiand land to polish ) and vice versa ( il sangue d'italia , il sangue polacco - the italian blood , the polish blood ) . 
  i 'm not really sure where the invasion came from either . 
  it used to be polish always , but after prussia took over they brought a lot of people there and they managed to grow some roots . 
  or * are * they ? 
  \u017bubr\u00f3wka is produced very close to my hometown , haha . 
  really good , you should try it with apple juice , it 's amazing . 
  never go full america . 
  yeah , but the media have access there guaranteed by our constitution . 
  i did n't draw it . 
  i just saw it , was pretty pissed with pis and posted it here . 
  if choosing wisely who i 'm acquainted with based on their attitude towards everything is a bubble then call me bubble bobble . 
  it 's probably the latter then , should i consider myself lucky ? 
  no , i do n't believe that people 's reaction to the scandal was planned in any way . 
  i 'd be there myself if i had n't moved elsewhere a week ago . 
  the scandal itself ? 
  who knows . 
  as for the megaphone , these fucking lunatics probably have it ready for every occasion . 
  they 're still the most popular party in poland . 
  maybe our healthcare system is too good , because i do n't know anyone younger than 50 who 'd vote for them . 
  thanks my freund , you bring the sauerkraut and i 'll get vodka , 
  this is n't maidan ... 
  i swear , it 's either black or white with some people , grey areas exist too . 
  po this , po that . 
  you 're the one that makes them relevant , while it 's not about that past-it party at all . 
  like i said , you 're welcome to show me a bigger protest in response to something that has happened 24hrs before . 
  i 'll gladly agree with you then . 
  for now though , you sound like a pis apologist . 
  it 's still a massive turnout for a spontaneous protest , unprecedented in recent years . 
  yay thanks . 
  hopefully not relevant username . 
  you 're saying it like 5 thousands of people going on the streets is a small number . 
  what the fuck ? 
  it 's a huge reaction . 
  did you expect millions or something ? 
  please tell me when was the last time people got out in such huge numbers 24h after something that concerns them happened . 
  are you a little slow ? 
  why do i have to explain everything twice to you ? 
  i do n't give a fuck about karma otherwise i would n't have this conversation with you ( these are a downvote magnet ) . 
  what i said is that you 're in minority with your opinion about this cartoon , as evidenced by the upvote-to-downvote ratio ( 76 % ) , yet you prance around saying shit about honest critique when all you did is criticize , without actually saying anything meaningful whatsoever . 
  that 's my last reply to you , as you can imagine i have enough cretins to argue with on my fb feed now that the politics are interesting . 
  i think you need to learn some reading comprehension . 
  i 'm not saying it 's on a brink of a ruin so stop putting words in my mouth . 
  i said he 's gon na ruin this country - after another 3 years the damage he 'll do will be irreparable on domestic and international fronts . 
  as for the second point , well , i sure like to post them to random people interested in them , is n't it what reddit is for ? 
  upvotes show that people find its quality different than you do , go figure . 
  okay , but he literally promised them money for having babies , not just some policies to help them , but literally additional monthly revenue for people with multiple children . 
  i already explained to you why i posted it , if it 's still unclear then ask an adult for help . 
  yes , i actually am fun at parties , because i do n't crash them to tell everyone their jokes are n't subtle nor funny . 
  does satire have to be subtle and funny to everyone ? 
  it 's not funny and it wo n't be funny , because the person pictured is gon na ruin my country . 
  sharing this with you is my way to cope . 
  it 's not the setting policies part that triggers people most , but working against our constitution . 
  it baffles me that it can even be done ... that cunning little man wants to push us in a direction we really do n't want to go . 
  he literally bought himself voters with our budget . 
  it 's not a conflict of 2 parties , the opposition is everyone who 's not pis , not just the previous ruling party . 
  and each one got satired  . 
  but i do n't think we 've ever been in a situation like that , it 's slowly starting to look like hungary . 
  guess jarek is getting too buddy-buddy with orban and got a few ideas . 
  yes , that 's exactly my choice . 
  they are n't the best in terms of organization though , sadly . 
  unlike pis who have a fucking snake in the person of kaczy\u0144ski to do all the shady stuff behind the scenes . 
  they have n't replaced it , i 've had one yesterday . 
  there 's just more variety now . 
  honestly , do people believe that he actually gets most votes ? 
  i 'd imagine a man powerful enough to stage a fake coup & eliminate all his political opponents is powerful enough to fake election results . 
  lol they 're nowhere near far-right , you 're thinking of ruch narodowy . 
  that 's certainly more democratic than one party having control over every aspect of life in a country . 
  the courts at least kept them at check - with control over them , they can do ** anything ** . 
  of course , the judicial system in poland needs a massive rehaul . 
  but it 's supposed to remain independent of the ruling party , no matter who 's in charge . 
  except it was 75k according to the police and 150k according to right wing media ( republika tv ) . 
  not to mention that yesterday there were way more than 150k people on the streets of poland ( they urged everyone to protest in their cities ) while that march was ` centralized ' , as you can see by numerous flags from all over poland . 
  also , it 's an annual national event , not spontaneous march to the street that you can see at the moment . 
  also , i have no clue why you posted it here , it 's not a competition and everyone 's democracy is at stake , not just the pis opponents ' . 
  ** false ** . 
  he specifically said he 's vetoing it due to the principles . 
  he even said that he consulted zofia romaszewska , one of the opposition leaders from the communist times , who said :  i 've already lived in a country that had an attorney general with a lot of power and i do n't want to get back to those times, 
  i honestly can not fucking believe it .
