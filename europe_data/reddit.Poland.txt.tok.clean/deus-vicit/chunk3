   you were looked after . 
  when you pick up that history book , you 'll see that it was us that often looked after them . 
   they should not have let you in . 
  just leave the eu , ffs . 
  do it now . 
  you should really crawl back into whatever sand dune you came from . 
  we 'll see about it . 
  i know that . 
  we joined the eu to be in an economic partnership , not to become a dumping ground for third world immigrants . 
   ased on a profoundly sexist , homophobic and anti-rational foundation , with varying degrees of egregiousness what are some examples of this ? 
   from the tame and timid anglicans , to mormon-owned utah ( and i 've heard some pretty nasty things about them ) to the horrorshow that is uganda . 
  i ca n't really comment specifically on the practices of protestants , i am a catholic christian myself . 
   just because islam is overall more reactionary and prone to extremism does n't let the rest off the hook . 
  christianity ca n't even be compared to islam , though . 
  there 's really no such thing as christian terrorism . 
   but it 's important to keep in mind what happens when people with a '' mandate from god '' and a fucked-up moral imperative based on dark-age values get too much leeway . 
  i 'd love to hear more examples of this . 
    they can in no way be trusted to uphold basic rights such as the right to abortion . 
  case in point : look at the shit pis tried to pull last year with abortions . 
  despicable . 
  i guess we just have different views on what basic rights are . 
  i believe everyone has the right to life . 
  i also believe that pis was walking the equal rights/progressive movement one step further by advocating for those that are n't born yet . 
   yeah they did n't blow anyone up but forcing women to have children they do n't want is just as inexcusable . 
  if a woman does n't want to have a child , then she should n't engage in sexual activity . 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  sad to see . 
  everything you say is true . 
  it just really makes western europeans come off as weak . 
  yeah , yeah . 
  i can similarly say that atheism is the antithesis of progress to due the barbaric tendencies of its adherents . 
  the original question was why we as christians ( the true religion of peace ) are lumped together with the followers of a 7th century warlord . 
   religion why clump all of us together ? 
  you do n't see christians blowing themselves up . 
  christianity continues to grow while atheists fail to reproduce . 
  stop being so pedophobic , man . 
  the majority of pagans converted on their own will and the northern crusades were a move by nobles for more power/land . 
  / u/clockworkghost -, 
   forced conversion to christianity where did you get that from ? 
   it is not wise to commit a crime while you are being film . 
  buddy , did you see how many of them there are ? 
  i 'd rather honk and plow through the tree than risk being shanked to death . 
   you would make a bad criminal.a shame to the profession . 
  yeah , but at least i 'd be alive . 
  i would n't have stopped , honestly . 
  i 'm eager to find out why you think so . 
  it 's not hate , it 's facts . 
  i also hope you have a nice day . 
  ca n't come up with a counterargument ? 
  relative to their size in the population , homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals . 
   contraception was specifically invented to allow people to satisfy their sexual desires without having to have offsprings . 
  again , the cons of contraception outweigh the pros . 
  prior to contraception becoming popular , there were only 2 stds . 
  today there 's over 20 . 
  it would be better for all aspects of society if people were committed to having sex in a monogamous marriage . 
  there would be more stable families ( higher fertility rates , less criminals , happier society , etc ) and the money that 's wasted on disease-ridden fornicators could utilized for other useful scientific research . 
   are you really that dim or just from 700bc ? 
  you can insult me , but that wo n't change facts . 
  continue to wallow in your filth . 
  if she is pregnant with a child , then she must give birth to it . 
  if she does n't want it after it 's born , give it up for adoption . 
  the vatican spends more on scientific research than princeton ever will . 
  yes , but heterosexuals are 95 % + of the population . 
  do you understand what i 'm saying ? 
   homosexuals only make up ** 2-4 % ** of the population , but they account for ** 30-40 % ** of pedophiles . 
  i 'm not telling you to not have sex . 
  i 'm merely saying that the best place to have sex is in a monogamous marriage . 
  if you have sex , you need to be ready to maturely deal with the possible outcome ( raising a child ) . 
  that 's easier in a marriage than while single . 
  til being pro-life puts me at the same level as the taliban . 
   are you sure you know what this `` thinking '' is ? 
  you really got me there . 
   there is literally no proof in history whatsoever for this statement . 
  yes , there is . 
  children born ( if they 're lucky enough to not be killed before they 're born ) to fornicating single mothers are more likely to be raised as criminals . 
  this is mostly avoided in families resulting from monogamous marriages . 
  every single study out there supports what i wrote . 
   people like you are really keen on protecting unborn life . 
  born life ... not so much . 
  do n't you see the hypocrisy in that ? 
  where did you get this ? 
  of course i support helping born life . 
  the first challenge is to make sure that they 're not killed as babies before being born . 
  which is what ? 
  on most women it has a lot more negative effects than positive ones . 
   what responsibilities responsibility of giving a birth to a child . 
   are you saying it 's a woman 's fault for getting raped wtf no, 
   sure am looking for the legions of confirmed virgins who 'll dutifully delay their completely natural urges till they 're thirty who said that you have to wait until you 're 30 ? 
  most people have stable jobs by the time they 're in their 20s . 
   and then stop fucking altogether after their stable job stops being enough to support more than two kids . 
  again , nope . 
  there 's natural methods of preventing pregnancies ( e.g. 
  [ natural family planning ] ( https://ccli.org/what-is-nfp/benefits/ ) ) . 
  besides , if you engage in the act of sexual reproduction , then you should always be open to the possibility of kids . 
   your opinion in this case is wrong - it clashes with scientific and medical facts . 
  which part exactly ? 
   ** ( 1 ) ** the morning-after pill is a hormone-based preparation ( it can contain oestrogens , oestrogen/progestogens or only progestogens ) which , within and no later than 72 hours after a presumably fertile act of sexual intercourse , has a predominantly `` anti-implantation '' function , i.e. , it prevents a possible fertilized ovum ( which is a human embryo ) , by now in the blastocyst stage of its development ( fifth to sixth day after fertilization ) , from being implanted in the uterine wall by a process of altering the wall itself . 
   the final result will thus be the expulsion and loss of this embryo . 
   only if this pill were to be taken several days before the moment of ovulation could it sometimes act to prevent the latter ( in this case it would function as a typical `` contraceptive '' ) . 
   however , the woman who uses this kind of pill does so in the fear that she may be in her fertile period and therefore intends to cause the expulsion of a possible new conceptus ; above all , it would be unrealistic to think that a woman , finding herself in the situation of wanting to use an emergency contraceptive , would be able to know exactly and opportunely her current state of fertility .
