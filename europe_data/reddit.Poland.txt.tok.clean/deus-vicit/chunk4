   ** ( 2 ) ** the decision to use the term `` fertilized ovum '' to indicate the earliest phases of embryonic development can in no way lead to an artificial value distinction between different moments in the development of the same human individual . 
  in other words , if it can be useful , for reasons of scientific description , to distinguish with conventional terms ( fertilized ovum , embryo , fetus , etc. ), 
  different moments in a single growth process , it can never be legitimate to decide arbitrarily that the human individual has greater or lesser value ( with the resulting variation in the duty to protect it ) according to its stage of development . 
   ** ( 3 ) ** it is clear , therefore , that the proven `` anti-implantation '' action of the morning-after pill is really nothing other than a chemically induced abortion . 
  it is neither intellectually consistent nor scientifically justifiable to say that we are not dealing with the same thing . 
   moreover , it seems sufficiently clear that those who ask for or offer this pill are seeking the direct termination of a possible pregnancy already in progress , just as in the case of abortion . 
  pregnancy , in fact , begins with fertilization and not with the implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine wall , which is what is being implicitly suggested . 
   ** ( 4 ) ** consequently , from the ethical standpoint the same absolute unlawfulness of abortifacient procedures also applies to distributing , prescribing and taking the morning-after pill . 
  all who , whether sharing the intention or not , directly co-operate with this procedure are also morally responsible for it . 
   a gay couple does n't harm anyone . 
  wrong . 
  on average , homosexuals only make up 2-4 % of the population , but they account for 30-40 % of pedophiles . 
  if you support the homosexual movement , then you might as well support all the other reprobates that healthy and functioning societies reject . 
   its about them having the same rights as everyone else ( i.e. 
  marriage , adoption etc ) . 
  of course , i understand that . 
  pedophiles and murderers also want equal rights . 
  why should n't we support their cause ? 
   that is literally punishing women for having sex . 
  how so ? 
  if you engage in the act of sexual reproduction , then it might obviously result in a child . 
   and that is a typical religious macho bullshit . 
  it 's common sense , or so i thought . 
   you say monogamous relationahip should be encouraged , but there is no law that is forcing the man to stay and take care of the baby . 
  i said that monogamous marriage should be encouraged . 
  these are the partnerships that result in the most stable and healthy families . 
  sadly , divorce is a thing , but you know that alimony ( usually paid by the father ) is a thing . 
  this is the difference between a marriage and fornication . 
  in marriage , a father has an obligation to the child ( either due to his love or legal consequences ) where he has to help the mother . 
  in fornication , a woman does n't have that option and she is encouraged by society to kill the child . 
  there is always the option of adoption , if the mother decides that she does n't want it . 
  there 's tons of parents out there that would raise the child . 
   and your right wing government made sure that are a few laws that are forcing the woman to carry out the pregnancy . 
  which is good . 
  everyone has a right to live . 
  like i said , if the mother does n't want the child , then adoption is an option . 
  i replied to the guy that was talking about abortion centres and then another guy replied to me about fetuses . 
   as for the pill , it is a chemically induced abortion . 
  nobody forces you too fool around at 16 . 
  if you 're sensible , you 'll get married when you 're mature enough and have a stable job that can support a family . 
   because consensual love for someone on those grounds , would you support equal rights for incestous relationships , then ? 
   fuck you , fucking idiot . 
  great argument !, 
   what about if they do n't want sex but still want to be on the pill ? 
  what is the point of that , though ? 
  the birth control pill has no benefits to health , rather it has a lot of detrimental effects . 
  it would be best to use [ natural family planning ] ( https://ccli.org/what-is-nfp/benefits/ ) , which is very effective at achieving or preventing pregnancies and has none of these negative effects . 
  i did n't know america was so dangerous that women ca n't leave their houses if they do n't want to get raped . 
   `` responsibilities '' ? 
  if a woman gets pregnant after being raped , why would you punish the child for what the father did ? 
  the rape excuse is also getting a little bit old . 
  only < 0.5 % of pregnancies in the us are aborted due to them being victims of rape . 
  most of the time it 's simply because a woman does n't feel like having a kid . 
  this does n't nullify their responsibilities . 
  a baby already utilizes its brain in the first trimester . 
  yes , you are right . 
  that 's why monogamous marriages should be encouraged . 
  the nervous system ( which includes the brain ) is one of the first systems that a baby starts developing , friend . 
   why do you hate women ? 
  i do n't hate women , what makes you think that ? 
  if they are old enough to have sex , then they should be prepared to take responsibility for the possible outcome . 
  what about all the terrorists that have entered the eu as refugees and traveled around freely ? 
  at what point do you consider it to be a child ? 
  good . 
  some women will do anything to kill their kids , i guess . 
  you ca n't force everyone to accept your lifestyle . 
  the theory of evolution is silly , my religion has nothing to do with that conclusion . 
  what exactly makes me uneducated ? 
  i 'm a natural sciences major in university and i 've studied evolution for years . 
  i find it extremely unbelievable . 
   you never visited the us bible belt , right ? 
  or germany in general . 
  please give me some examples of why it 's bad . 
  edgy, 
  why do n't you go to the middle east as an atheist , then ? 
  was there anything wrong in either of my posts ? 
  degeneracy is the root of all problems . 
   the smell of flame war is incoming i 'm fine with it . 
  it 's not like any of this is false . 
   anyway , galileo was condemned by the church if you do n't remember . 
  i do remember , but you 've only been told the first part of the story . 
  the church and most clergy ( especially the jesuits ) supported him throughout his scientific discoveries ( most of which later turned out to be false , anyways ) . 
  he only started to get attention when he publicly started slandering the pope . 
  he was treated fairly and told to stop , but he did n't and continued with his antics . 
  he was told to tone it down not because of his discoveries , but because of his attitude towards his fellow scientific community and those who funded him . 
   while it 's undeniable that there were and are religious scientists , the high hierarchies were n't too open-minded . 
  they were , though . 
  for example , let 's take galileo . 
  it was his fellow scientist community tha largely rejected him , while the clergy embraced his research . 
   also , what degeneracies have increased if i may ask ? 
  sins such as lust , fornication , adultery , murder ( which includes methods such as euthanasia and abortion ) , sodomy , and the list goes on . 
  there 's tons of other issues that also arise from what i listed , most commonly atheism . 
   more details . 
  from a practical standpoint , the church was the original eu ( and a better one ) . 
  it united europe like no other force ever did . 
  the church was the foundation of european success . 
  they funded scholars , universities and explorations . 
  any major scientific discoveries are due to the church and that has n't changed today . 
  the top universities are all catholic . 
  anyone that slanders the church for being ` anti-science ' is historically illiterate .
