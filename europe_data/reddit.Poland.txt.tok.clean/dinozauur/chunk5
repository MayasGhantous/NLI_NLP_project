  moscow is since eternity a symbol of anti-civilisation in poland and we have generally a very bad opinion about you we have never taken anything from you , we have never wanted to and we never will well there 's probably one exception . 
  i 've read that based on your experience , we have created an audit institution which is probably the most respected office here, 
  your president is a joke and you 've given 2nd place in your parliamentary elections to some random populist retard plus you 're also more corrupt than us . 
  you already are infected and this is probably it distorts your view of other countries, 
  the germans just see themselves as teachers for the poles , nothing unusual they just a have a very special attitude towards us that they have towards no other country, 
  the germans are arrogant enough not to bother themselves with collecting proper information , instead they blow everything out of the proportion and exaggerate regular , internal reforms to the point where they depict this is a coup , and get their news from an ideologically homogenous group of journalists that are known for not liking the ruling party in poland since probably forever i wonder why is this the german * modus operandi * ? 
  is it because somebody is looking to justify their deeply hidden , for the time being , aversion to poland ? 
  and now we can finally get back to our usual , genuine views of poland ? 
  because it 's really the germans that are fueling this there 's no pluralism in germany anymore , you have self-censoring media that fire people because they 've criticized the idea of mass immigration , you should look at yourselves instead of putting your nose in our internal affairs even the germans say that you ca n't openly debate controversial issues in public better take care of your issues with free speech, 
  the bbc is n't pluralistic as well if you have a society where there are cultural divisions and there are many disagreements , you 'll probably end up with a system in which when the government changes , many journalists and staff from the public tv or radio get wiped out that does n't happen when there is a sense of unity in a country , but that unity can also have the face of russia  i like the model in which the governing party and the opposition get their channels in the public tv , i think this is how it works in germany , but then the opposition is n't united as well , so i guess in the end you just have to count on the competences and good will of the current public media staff, 
  he did n't describe his opponents as second class citizens but he made a general remark about the `` tradition of treason '' in polish history without pointing to specific people also , he did n't call anyone `` gestapo-like '' . 
  by the way , should n't he be supportive of gestapo if he 's a national socialist ? 
  and the reporter was n't `` beaten '' but poked and the same happened when a politican of the former ruling party poked a female jounralist when she was recording a video about the protests that took place near the parliament you have no idea what you 're talking about , you even have no idea what national-socialism was , i assume it is because you also lack knowledge about all the myths that were very strong in the german culture, 
  wow do you really think that a party in which its leader 's father took part in the warsaw uprising is national-socialist ? 
  are you really this dumb ? 
  this is getting funnier and funnier  i did n't expect this level of anger to outburst during a shift of political power in a country did anyone even bother to check what was the state of our public media when the former government was in power ? 
  when almost everybody in the media was supportive of the ruling party and journalists that shared views with the opposition party were all wiped out from the tv or radio , with a single exception of a man who had his show shifted to late hours ? 
  the level of hypocrisy , hysteria and ignorance is so huge that you really ca n't take all these alarms being raised , as serious, 
  terrible article that does n't explain antyhing , only exposes the author 's ignorance  in order to appease those poles , who found themselves on the losing end of economic reforms , they blamed former security agents , who allegedly infiltrated businesses and syphoned money out of them you do n't have to be someone who has lost in economic reforms to agree with that diagnosis , as this is simply a historical fact , accepted by everybody , except staunch critics of the right wingers , who will say anything if it contradicts the beliefs of the right yes business is/was to some extent infiltrated by former communist secret services and their secret agents . 
  but it requires reading about the roots of influential polish businessmen , academics , politicians etc. , just simply stepping outside your comfort zone, 
  so this is why the swedes got so mad in the mid xviith century ... 
  [ i am john paul ii , and i approve that gif ] ( http://www.swjakub.pl/images/stories/jargrafika/inne/1.jpg ), 
  it was about making a general point in response to the alleged `` soviet influence '' you just ca n't go for the mono-causal explanation, 
  i believe catalonia is a part of spain since the xviiith century ? 
  this idea is a gigantic failure because : 1 ) it 's significantly going to weaken incentives for work , at least for some 2 ) it makes citizens dependent on the state on an unprecedented scale ( i 'm leaving fascism , nazism and communism out ) , where the state literally will be responsible for maintaining the citizenry 3 ) it will de-politicize and alienate people even more and destroy social bonds , because the leviathan will take care of everything 4 ) considering the above - this is yet another step to destroy liberty and impose an almighty surveillance state , as hobbes wished for so anybody who is enthusiastic about that does n't treat liberty seriously . 
  probably because he does n't know shit about history and political thought anyway this is going to collapse just like any idea of a state - `` rationalized '' economy . 
  the soviets already tried to manipulate with economical transactions in order to `` rationalize '' the society and make it equal ( and that 's really the logic behind this common pay ) . 
  did n't work in the long run, 
  the germans will come up with something they already had the idea of remaking the roman empire and now they 're really putting the pressure on southern states so much that they hate them and think that euro was planned as a german conspiracy this is a good start for integrating europe, 
  there 's a lot of corruption in spain and italy because clearly , they 've been free of the soviet influence and there 's a very liberal abortion law in post-soviet countries , because they 've been influenced by the ussr , because only people with soviet mentality impose liberal abortion laws ( your logic ), 
  [ you can clearly see the soviet camp here ] ( http://one-europe.info/user/files/330cs3b.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/72724000/gif/_72724992_eu_corruption_labels_624map%283%29.gif ), 
  poland is too racist and xenophobic you should let us stay homogenous for your own safety this is also why immigrants ca n't come to poland and why poland should be let to stay alone, 
  spain right now is a fake , not internally integrated country the only thing that holds catalonia and spain together is spanish nationalism and the army  the spanish should let catalonia go, 
  i mean that they started the whole process and it 's the first party that ever thought of creating the first central , anti-corruption , non-communist office, 
  yes and they can strike down the decisions of elected representatives , who are the foundation of democracy i 'm just pointing to the logic of democracy . 
  constitutional courts can distort the logic of the democratic political system , that happened many times in the usa . 
  then in effect it 's really legal experts who rule rather than politicians but of course you can be critical of democracy and then indeed , the judges should be viewed as a powerful center of power , almost unrestrained in their competences and then they can rule with an easy , regular majority, 
  i think that the title would suit our current president of the cc better , as he was , as you know , in the communist party ; , 
  did those gerb/dps parties also create a central , anti-corruption office that in consequence brought down corruption in poland so that now it 's , according to ti , placed 35 . in their rank and bulgaria is 69 . ? 
  i 'm talking about the cc judges in general . 
  i do n't care by whom they have been elected why is it that people elect their representatives to the parliament and then 15 judges have the power to strike down a bill with just a regular majority ? 
  you had your coup during local elections in 2014 when there ware nearly 2 million invalid votes you reinterpret everything in a discrediting way for the current government rather than from the point of abstract rules and ideas and so this is why i have a different opinion , because i think some of those changes are simply fair constitutional courts can become a pain in the neck . 
  it has been proven in the usa and our court proved that when it had stuck down lustration, 
  i 'm in favor of making the tribunal vote with a majority formulated in a fraction ( whether it should be 2/3rds i do n't know , i like 3/5ths more ) . 
  i think this is just fair we 've learned from the us supreme court that judges also must have restraints imposed upon them , because otherwise they tend to distort the political system and act as if they have an executive power like the parliament or the president * some * judges can just easily find any excuse to rule according not really to the law , but to their personal preferences , thus they should have it a bit harder, 
  dunno , people often use 3/5ths and 2/3rds, 
  russia is a sick country with a soviet mentality still in place , because their soviet authorities constantly bolster the pride in both the soviet union and imperial russia ( yes , in russia you can be proud of the tsar and stalin at the same time ) this is why russia will never really reform itself because they care more about foreign issues than internal issues . 
  and if this is the case , well then surely anyone who criticizes the government 's foreign policy puts himself on the line, 
  so you 're saying that the procedure for electing judges is unconstitutional ? 
  :d the tribunal can only tell the parliament that it should change some articles in a particular bill , but it 's beyond its power to say whether a judge was elected illegaly or legally, 
  but why should n't judges with a weak legitimization vote with a 2/3rds majority ? 
  what is so undemocratic about that ? 
  if the c.court 's position is too strong and they make decisions too easily , then we end up with with a center of power that manipulates the law and the constitution , as it happened in the usa , where some of the s.court 's decisions were made on completely ridicolous grounds, 
  there 's no such thing as an `` illegal '' judge all judges ( right now we have 20 elected judges ) were elected and some of them are sworn tribunal has no power to decide who is `` legal '' or `` illegal '', 
  what is wrong in making the tribunal rule by a majority of 2/3rds ? 
  why should the judges rule with a regular majority ? 
  you may like it or not , but it 's really not that controversial and saying that the `` eu '' urges poland to do something is an exaggeration . 
  only few people really expressed concerns anyways , they ca n't really do much . 
  there was the same hysteria with orban and hungary and they did n't end up being isolated, 
  polish school : - english 6 y.o. 
  - german 10 y.o. 
  i never bring the nazis , because that passed away and wo n't come back and i precisely wrote this i referred to the xix-xviii th century attitude of germany ( or maybe it 's better to say prussia ) towards poland , when for some reasons you were angry at us and thought that you have a right to teach us certain things . 
  this spirit , although not literally , still exists in the german media the sense that you can say anything about poland , accuse us of falling into a dictatorship , drop the explanation of the whole political and historical context of polish politics and in general create a national drama and histeria in germany , all in order to arrogantly school us on democracy and by the way , do you think it is wise that germany is alienating another of its neighbours ? 
  you have the south against you , you have france against you , why have poland against you ? 
  do n't forget you like to get into a duo, 
  i 'm not referring to the jokes , although they 're also a sign of some things , but this is n't something i 'm interested in . 
  there 's an increasing arrogance and teacher attitude towards poland in germany, 
  generally speaking - it would be just for the uk to break up uk is a non-integrated country created by simple , primitive conquest of scotland . 
  the scots have never really felt any bond with the english and the english have no right to keep scottish lands but from the political perspective , the british break-up would cause too big of a turmoil and obviously , you want to live in an as stable environment , as possible, 
  i believe `` dziadek mr\u00f3z '' works only for the russians , ukrainians and belarussians, 
  i 'm talking about the media , that took a histerical stance against the current polish government and one article even duplicated the argument given by den alten fritz that justified the partitions this is weird , because you have changed your attitude towards the jews , romas and homosexuals , yet your opinion about the poles seems to have gone back just to the xixth century and i think this anger will only get stronger of course i 'm not talking about the nazi-stance , nevertheless irritation and anger still exist and the sense that somehow you should be a teacher figure for poland, 
  you are taking in immigrants that live off of welfare , you do n't really know how many legitimate refugees have you taken in , as they ca n't be even properly checked by your policemen but this is just a consequence of your politics , yet despite the fact that u do n't have the info , you still want to have a beef with us, 
  we need to get deeper , sorry, 
  the ukrainian immigration increased after the war in donbas had started , so i 'm sure some of those ukrainians came to poland because of war and do you know how many * legitimate * refugees did germany , france or britain take ? 
  because from what i know those refugees camps , you know , exist in turkey , lebanon and jordan , 
  i 'm not saying this , but there is this special feature of wapo that does n't bring them credibility as well , so i would speculate , that yes indeed this article was inspired by anne applebaum, 
  but she obviously has still influences there and she writes articles for them from time to time and she 's a respected journalist in the usa there is a clear conflict of interests there - she 's the wife of the former foreign minister and writes for the newspaper that reports on the topic of the former opposition party, 
  we 've taken already half a million ukrainians besides , you should understand that some of those eu funds go back to the countries that had poured them in, 
  eurofunds are like what , 2 % of our annual gdp ? 
  the single european market is far more important for poland than the eurofunds , because those eurofunds go back to germany and france in the end besides , poland is considered an `` emerging '' market and those countries tend to have a faster gdp growth than the countries that are already highly developed . 
  if the productivity in poland stops to increase , then obviously no amount of money will be helpful, 
  clearly * die h\u00e4sslichen deutschen * are preparing the ground to justify their future outburst of distaste and arrogance towards the poles , once again this is why * die h\u00e4sslichen deutschen * are distorting the words and report things about poland in a sensationalist and manipulative way to make it look like there will be a sort of censorship imposed on the media in poland * die h\u00e4sslichen deutschen * did n't report about how the current public television is heavily in favor of the former government and how there was almost no one who would represent the views of the former opposition . 
  this is * des alten fritz * spirit the arrogance of the germans is absolutely mind-blowing and i do n't get why are they so obsessed about the poles , that they constantly talk about poland in a highly emotional manner, 
  the supporters of the former governing party and alike seem to slowly fade away and be less active there is absolutely no reason to be concerned about democracy or rule of law in poland i remember how the former government helped to take over one of the biggest polish daily `` rzeczpospolita '' . 
  why then was there no outcry about censorship or the end of democracy ? 
  i also remember the way in which investigative comission in sejm handled the gambling affair all those people shouting about the end of democracy are just a bunch of hypocrites that ca n't accept that they 've lost miserably in the last elections, 
  this means that the parliament is obliged to change the wrong articles and that a sentence of a court can be changed . 
  and also you know when the law ca n't act backwards the cc ca n't tell me whether i should return the car or go to jail, 
  well i disagree here - i think the only case in which the tribunal can tell the president what he should do is when there is a conflict regarding competences of the central offices of the state ( eg how the president should cooperate with the government around foreign policy ) if there was an article in a bill which would say that one becomes a judge after the oath , and cc would be asked to rule on this , then the situation would be way clearer, 
  that is zubik 's opinion . 
  some think that one becomes a judge after the oath and if the president refuses to take the oath , then the office of the judge is voided then , the president is n't judged by the cc and it has nothing to do with his impeachment, 
  the cc could only tell what the president is supposed to do , when it would be asked to solve a conflict between the central offices of the country about their competences [ article 3 par 5 ] ( http://trybunal.gov.pl/o-trybunale/akty-normatywne/ustawa-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym/ ), 
  this means that the parliament is obliged to change the regulation and correct the bill , but there 's no way that the cc can tell the president `` you are obliged to do this '', 
  that 's fully correct , esp . 
  because pis is the most sceptical party about russia  and by the way - how are things with nord stream 2 going ? 
  how can the cc tell the president what to do , when it 's only supposed to say whether a legal act violates the constitution ? 
  welfare spending is the biggest position probably in every country , 
  why is the increase in family benefits spending populist ? 
  do you even know how much poland spends on its welfare ? 
  it 's not an authoritarian government , rather the media that are ideologically opposed to the newly elected party , describe it this way .
