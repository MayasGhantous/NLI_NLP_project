`` in this world & nbsp ; hate never yet dispelled hate & nbsp ; only love dispels hate & nbsp ; this is the law & nbsp ; ancient and inexhaustible & nbsp ; you to shall pass away & nbsp ; knowing this , how can you quarrel '', 
  no they are not this bad - they are not objective for sure - but also nowhere close to what alt-left try to sell people . 
  went through all of them - far from calling people pedophiles - dont try to play a player . 
  pretty much on point, 
  summer started - kids are out of school - every one dramatise - majority of poland dont give a fuck about alt-left . 
  do n't be pathetic . 
  catholic church ? 
  or german catholic church ? 
  eu officials will take you to the cleaners / shitshow . 
  as a true gentleman i always take of my trousers , before jizz ` ing - i 'm no barbarian . 
  warsaw , poland ( ap ) -- the duke and duchess of cambridge shook hands with wellwishers and met with world war ii veterans in poland on monday at the start of a two-country goodwill trip that is intended to underscore britain 's intention to maintain friendly ties with the european union that it is in the process of leaving . 
  cool - post some ctrl-left meme from time to time . 
  i have no problem with laughing at myself , 
  appreciate your comment - will do my best to control my outrage , 
  i did n't know that only alt-left ideology is allowed in r/europe . 
  ok - fair point . 
  but can you at least imagine the posibility that countries with substantial ` middle eastern ' migrants population may have a little bit of a problem with rape and women harasment . 
  or shoud we not mention the koran attitude toward women completely ? 
  german chancellor angela merkel refused to place an upper limit on refugees that the country accepts , speaking in an annual ** interview broadcast on sunday . 
  ** distancing herself from the position of her conservative bavarian sister party , the christian social union ( csu ) , merkel , who leads the christian democratic union ( cdu ) , said placing a limit on refugees was not the way forward . 
  ** `` as far as an upper limit is concerned , my position is clear : i will not accept it , '' ** she said , saying that numbers could be reduced by regulation and taking action to prevent the situations that cause people to flee one country for another . 
  ** that position places her in conflict with csu leader horst seehofer who threatened not to enter into coalition without an annual upper limit for refugee numbers . 
  only ? 
  i 'm not denying anything - in poland we just have n't jet accepted this type of behaviour as something normal and to be expected . 
  though germany seems to normalized it completely . 
  dont be childish - just google rape + poland / and / rape + germany and see what will come up . 
  maybe that 's the case in germany . 
  not in pl . 
  nope / google it / for me ** nytimes ** is reliable enough . 
  not to be an instigator - but i really ca n't remember any incidents when ` radical polish catholics ' lately assaulted any of lgbt members . 
  berlin -- german authorities say that a crowd of youths threw bottles at police during a weekend festival in a town near stuttgart . 
  they also are reporting ** four cases of women being sexually harassed ** , and three ** afghan asylum seekers are suspects in one case . 
  ** police said monday that many of the youths had been drinking . 
  the incidents in schorndorf on friday and saturday evenings three cases of sexual harassment on friday , in one of which an iraqi is suspected , and a further case on saturday . 
  in the latter case , the three afghans allegedly groped a 17-year-old girl .

  but talks about those reforms started way earlier . 
  conservative ( right wing ) political views \u2260 fascism . 
  those conservative views were the foundation of christian europe and modern western values on which upon our countries were build on . 
  money and power . 
  fascist , you say - my grandparents killed a few of those - so i suggest , mind your words . 
  now go and make koran belts of europe . 
  how dare you - there is no crime in netherlands . 
  in america you do n't have post communist judiciary clique at helm of supreme court . 
  concerned , but unfortunately very gullible . 
  hahahahaha  thank god that we have so little stupid people in poland , 
  so now judge 's assistans are at fault - next you will try to convince me that polish people simply commit to many crimes and that is the real reasons why our judiciary system is so shity . 
  check yourself before you wreck yourself boiii . 
  yeah - i know . 
  liberals can be close-minded , just like black people can be racist . 
  who would thought that ( not you , ofcourse ), 
  only in your close-minded opinion, 
  and all pis members are evil - or is that just yours prejudices . 
  polityka.pl / / wpolityce.pl / / 300polityka.pl if this is not an echo chamber , than i dont know what is . 
  and again , dont you think that gazetaprawna is more reliable source ? 
  wyborcza.pl is as good source of unbiased news as `` wykop.pl '' + gazeta prawna seems to be a little bit more realible , dont you think ? 
  who is to decide , which professor is of higher moral standard - i do n't feel competent enough to do it - do you ? 
  what type of retard , looks for news on `` wykop '' ( do not say i do it ) . 
   & nbsp ; my news sources tend to be : http://www.thenews.pl/ http://wbj.pl/ http://www.economist.com/topics/poland https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland https://www.ft.com/ and few others + r/europe r/news r/worldnews etc. 
  + youtube . 
  i was n't speaking about economics . 
  i meant culture , values , safety . 
  we really enjoy our tradition , culture , language , history and we have nothing to be ashamed of and we are not intrested in `` multiculturialism '' , which eu is trying to force up our throats . 
  if you want to live in poland you will have to integrate and uptake our values . 
  not the other way orund . 
  that cuts deep - and i thought that ` left ' supposed to be more compassionate than that . 
  and we all know how bad is masculinity - big no-no in western europe - we will see how it will work out , for you guys  good luck , 
  but i tell you that there is no endangerment - in opinion , both professors and average polish people . 
  people that are most worried are a part of old crumbling cliques of post communist judges . 
   but three years ahead is ridiculous . 
  fully agree with you . 
  but just to point out , that even at this time of upheaval about ` polish judiciary system ' majority of poles still picks ( pis ) duda over ( po ) tusk . 
  i havent seen many germans in poland - but the opposite is true - we traveled and we are not that impressed with your country . 
  just this time stay on yours side of the border , and we will be more than ok . 
  article from `` gazeta prawna '' ( pl ) where prof. bogus\u0142aw banaszak explains why `` there is no breach of standards of the democratic state . '', 
  ** q : ** after the introduction of the amendment of the law on supreme court by the meps , the opposition raised the allegation that we were dealing with a `` coup d'etat '' and a `` july coup '' . 
  is this project really like the deputies of the opposition ? 
  ** professor banaszak : ** it can be said that the standards of the democratic state have not been compromised . 
  if we look at it from a comparative point of view , we see that in many countries the executive or the parliament decides the position of the judges . 
  the solutions adopted in poland do not violate the standards of many other democratic countries , even in germany , where the executive is largely determined by the executive , ie the government . 
  there are also countries where the monarch is stationed and thus the executive . 
  ** q : ** emotions are probably the most exciting issue of exchange of judges . 
  are there really reasons for concern about the state of democracy in poland ? 
  ** professor banaszek : ** if the composition of the supreme court is listed , then the judges will be selected again . 
  it is difficult to assume today that these judges , appointed in the new mode , will be worse off than those appointed in the previous procedure . 
  if they were judges , they had all personal qualities , guaranteed independence , independence in settling matters . 
  why now would it all change ? 
  just because some of the composition of the supreme court is mentioned in the new mode ? 
  the constitution clearly states that the national court register consists of 15 judges . 
  they are selected from among the judges . 
  what are the judges chosen by the judges different from the judges chosen by the parliament ? 
  they are the same people who have been chosen by the person who is entitled to it . 
  if the judges gave the marks that they were not worthy of being judges , they should simply be removed from the jury . 
  i do n't watch tv - most my news i get from internet - i 'm just `` hip '' like that / / and dont worry i do my best to listen to both sides of the argument - but in this case i pick pis . 
  ( and no - i did n't vote for them ),
