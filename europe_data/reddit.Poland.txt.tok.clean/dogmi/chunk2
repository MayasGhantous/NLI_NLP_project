  and you are so edgy with your liberal/apologetic worldview , 
   it was an attempt to make a clever response i assume ? 
  just did my best to match your `` refined and allmost poetic '' comment :  you should watch less tvpis , its lets to brain meltdown . 
  oh , you 're so edgy . 
  i see , school 's out for summer , and you decided to get into politics - thats cute , 
  those that can afford to stay in ( for example ) `` refuge '' free areas definitely will stay there . 
  i thought it was pretty obvious . 
  just like wealthy germans that voted for taking more migrants . 
  they dont have any reasons to leave there country . 
  as i said before - ** `` biggest enemy of freedom is well fed slave . 
  i dont know if it 's propaganda or values - but i definitely share , some of the same ideas with them ( pis ) . 
  god , honour , fatherland . 
  & nbsp ; ps . 
  i fully understand , that in de it may be unthinkable , to have your own opinion . 
  it is weak , but at the same time it 's nice to see democratic freedoms in action . 
  let them protes . 
  no one stops them . 
  ca n't argue with that . 
  `` biggest enemy of freedom is well fed slave . '', 
  yes , but it proves in my opinion , that west is not always right and western media can be also biased . 
  right wing , billionaires are billionaires because they know their markets and they know , what and where sells best . 
  at worst case scenario we will turn into turkish like `` dictatorship '' , and improve our relations with you guys  win/win situation = no coruption in courts or improved relations with our southern brothers turks , 
  of course - just wanted to point out that many , at first , controversial decisions of polish gov , turn out not be so bad after all ( at least for my country , in my own opinion ) . 
  phase them out = good point . 
  unfortunately i 'm not a part of pl gov. 
  and this online chatter will have no impact on this situation - you can say it 's already done . 
  we can now just patiently look for effects . 
  last time when eu was so upset about pis it was about refuges/migrants . 
  young people in poland had oportunity to work abroad ( de . 
  and they were simply not impressed with it 's , so called , liberal democracy . 
  political correctness ( censorship ) , biased ` left leaning ' media , and lack of , once so higly recognized by majority of europe , christian values . 
  if you think that removing corruption from ranks of judges will have no impact on that ... what can i say . 
  and yet , still better than yours . 
  if they fuck up ( pis ) in the next election , we will choose oposition party and they will appoint new judges . 
  + as i stated earlier :  curently polish judicary system have the largest number of judges per capita in whole eu , and at the same time law cases are being processed at the lowest speed in eu . 
  & nbsp ; ps . 
  i realise that this is not the most sophisticated method of changing the system but it is realy needed and supported by many poles . 
  the fact that you choose him as a joke/president proves to me and many others that you are unable , at least at the right moment , to recognize what corruption looks like . 
  much more  - but we all welcome this type of demonstrations in our democratic society . 
  they are silly , but more than entertaining . 
  feel free to come and visit us ( poland ) - i think you will find more than a few differences . 
  spoken like a true traitor , 
   it is difficult to assume today that these judges , appointed in the new mode , will be worse off than those appointed in the previous procedure . 
  if they were judges , they had all personal qualities , guaranteed independence , independence in settling matters . 
  why now would it all change ? 
  i gave you direct quote from professor of law and you provided me with * ` opinion piece ' * from online magazine and picture from twitter . 
  you 're cute , 
  the fact that turkey have erdogan and for so many years were unable to join eu is a proof in my mind that you could n't smell corruption even if it took a dump right on your chest , 
  funn fact 4 you - curently polish judicary system have the largest number of judges per capita in whole eu and at the same time law cases are being processed at the lowest speed in eu . 
  so either we have something wrong with judges appointing new judges ( corrupt ) or we have most complicated law cases . 
  you do the math . 
  it 's always fascinating to see people from outside comment on something that they know nothing about . 
  & nbsp ; the vast majority of poles support these changes + there are no different than what we see in western countries . 
  & nbsp ; article from `` gazeta prawna '' ( pl ) where prof. bogus\u0142aw banaszak explains why `` there is no breach of standards of the democratic state . '', 
  & nbsp ; ** q : ** after the introduction of the amendment of the law on supreme court by the meps , the opposition raised the allegation that we were dealing with a `` coup d'etat '' and a `` july coup '' . 
  is this project really like the deputies of the opposition ? 
  ** professor banaszak ** : it can be said that the standards of the democratic state have not been compromised . 
  if we look at it from a comparative point of view , we see that in many countries the executive or the parliament decides the position of the judges . 
  the solutions adopted in poland do not violate the standards of many other democratic countries , even in germany , where the executive is largely determined by the executive , ie the government . 
  there are also countries where the monarch is stationed and thus the executive . 
  ** q : ** emotions are probably the most exciting issue of exchange of judges . 
  are there really reasons for concern about the state of democracy in poland ? 
  ** professor banaszek ** : if the composition of the supreme court is listed , then the judges will be selected again .

  if they were judges , they had all personal qualities , guaranteed independence , independence in settling matters . 
  why now would it all change ? 
  just because some of the composition of the supreme court is mentioned in the new mode ? 
  the constitution clearly states that the national court register consists of 15 judges . 
  they are selected from among the judges . 
  what are the judges chosen by the judges different from the judges chosen by the parliament ? 
  they are the same people who have been chosen by the person who is entitled to it . 
  if the judges gave the marks that they were not worthy of being judges , they should simply be removed from the jury .

  good point , 
  i get your point , but still think that this type of journalism is just scaremongering and over dramatisation . 
  & nbsp ; ps . 
  i just dont see how judicial cliques that are `` at power '' at the moment are any better than what is proposed by pis . 
   i just had to step up . 
  no hard feelings ,
