  84 `` polonium '' and 88 `` radium '' were discovered by polish ( not french ) scientist [ marie curie-sklodowska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_curie ) . 
  this is an [ article ] ( http://prawo.gazetaprawna.pl/artykuly/1057902,standardy-panstwa-demokratycznego-reforma-sadownictwa.html ) from `` gazeta prawna '' ( pl ) where prof. bogus\u0142aw banaszak explains why `` there is no breach of standards of the democratic state . '', 
  & nbsp ;  q : after the introduction of the amendment of the law on supreme court by the meps , the opposition raised the allegation that we were dealing with a `` coup d'etat '' and a `` july coup '' . 
  is this project really like the deputies of the opposition ? 
   ** professor banaszak ** : it can be said that the standards of the democratic state have not been compromised . 
  if we look at it from a comparative point of view , we see that in many countries the executive or the parliament decides the position of the judges . 
  the solutions adopted in poland do not violate the standards of many other democratic countries , even in germany , where the executive is largely determined by the executive , ie the government . 
  there are also countries where the monarch is stationed and thus the executive . 
  & nbsp ;  q : emotions are probably the most exciting issue of exchange of judges . 
  are there really reasons for concern about the state of democracy in poland ? 
  & nbsp ;  ** professor banaszek ** : if the composition of the supreme court is listed , then the judges will be selected again . 
  it is difficult to assume today that these judges , appointed in the new mode , will be worse off than those appointed in the previous procedure . 
  if they were judges , they had all personal qualities , guaranteed independence , independence in settling matters . 
  why now would it all change ? 
  just because some of the composition of the supreme court is mentioned in the new mode ? 
   the constitution clearly states that the national court register consists of 15 judges . 
  they are selected from among the judges . 
  what are the judges chosen by the judges different from the judges chosen by the parliament ? 
  they are the same people who have been chosen by the person who is entitled to it . 
  if the judges gave the marks that they were not worthy of being judges , they should simply be removed from the jury . 
  it is an example of existing free speech in polish media - even this type of ` rubbish journalism ' is allowed . 
  respect \u2260 special treatment, 
  ** scaremongering ** - all european countries have similar way of chooseing judges . 
  poland have to catch up , and everyone is panicking becouse its being done by right wing partie . 
  & nbsp ; is this better comment ?

  you have to consider full context of this paragraph - aka read whole [ `` the parable of the ten minas '' ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+19:11-27 ) . 
  & nbsp ; and remember that parable is just a `` simple story used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson , as told by jesus in the gospels . '',

  this cautious policy has helped avoid the excesses of more than one european financial institution that led directly to some of the major problems experienced following the financial crisis of the late 2000s . 
  that some of these european entities were also vested in the polish banking sector meant that in several instances their problems spilled over into poland , impeding their ability to support and fund their polish operations . 
  when such a bank takes a strategic decision to sell its business in any country it should be free to do so ; such are the rules of an open market economy , as indeed is the case in poland . 
  we do not have a policy of `` nationalising '' or `` repolonising '' foreign-owned banks . 
  however , if there is a threat to the stability of the banking sector and the government can help out , it will endeavour to do so . 
  we believe this is the duty of responsible government and by no means equates to a conscious policy of nationalisation as was the case in several western european countries in their own period of postwar development , and more recently !, 
  balanced ownership between private and public is a given and needs to be approached with flexibility .

  millions will be invested in a new programme aimed at improving quality of life in poland , science and higher education minister jaros\u0142aw gowin has said . 
  the national centre for research and development will inject pln 500 million ( eur 118 million ) into the programme of support for socio-economic research . 
  gowin wants public institutions to team up with universities to devise and implement solutions to challenges faced by public administration . 
  as poland faces a demographic crisis , with a low birth rate and rapidly aging population , gowin hopes the family ministry or social insurance institution will get involved . 
  `` thanks to these funds they will develop solutions which will serve to support poland 's demographics , '' gowin said . 
  eligible consortia should be made up of at least two universities or other scientific organisations and one institution which can implement the research , such as a local government . 
  between 14 august and 12 september , bidders will be able to apply for up to pln 30 million as the programme -- called gospostrateg , a portmanteau of the polish words for economy and strategy -- opens its first competition with a pool of pln 150 million .
