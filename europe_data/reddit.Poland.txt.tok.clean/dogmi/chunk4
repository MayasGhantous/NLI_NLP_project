  i disagree - * summary * gives you a * `` gist of the article '' * . 
  title is just a title - unfortunately if you want to be really informed you have to read articles . 
  & nbsp ; ps . 
  that is why i translated the article and posted it whole here . 
  good luck finding not sensationalized news titles - i will stick with simply reading full articles - like a gentleman that i am , 
  nice, 
  and that is why everyone should read articles - hopefully people do n't make opinions based just on titles or post subjects . 
  youtube - professor jordan peterson , 
  ** unesco experts turned to the polish ministry of culture for help in preparing the rules for the reconstruction of the syrian aleppo . 
  the reason is unique in the world experience with the reconstruction of warsaw . 
  ** in 2018 , the national institute of heritage , an institution under the ministry of culture and national heritage , will organize a conference with unesco on the reconstruction of warsaw in the context of the contemporary tragedy of aleppo - deputy minister of culture prof. magdalena gawin . 
  the international body of specialists wants to know how poles have managed to make a world-only reconstruction of an almost completely demolished city . 
  - the conference will be held in the reconstructed royal palace in warsaw - gawin . 
  rebuilt from almost complete destruction , the historic center of warsaw was added to the world heritage list in 1980 . 
  this is an exception because unesco does not , in principle , enter the list of reconstructed buildings . 
  `` for poland , a derogation has been made , '' says gawin . 
  now unesco experts have recalled the unique experience of warsaw in the context of the ruined aleppo . 
  - it was thought we had a great reconstruction and know-how . 
  we have reproduced not only facades , but interiors , architectural details , whole . 
  thanks to these experiences , poland will play a crucial role in developing contemporary standards that may prove useful not only in the reconstruction of aleppo , but also in other cities after the wars , conflicts and tragedies , `` gawin says .

  we are not xenophobes - we just do n't believe that all cultures/religions are worth the same ( + we also are against violence - to a point / self defense ) . 
  we could use some french troops to - but we understand - white flags wo n't fold themselves . 
  you also have to keep an eye on your caliphate . 
  poles will definitely fight . 
  no matter political ideology , gender , income etc. 
  and people are asking why poland shits so hard on islam . 
  death penalty to all . 
  save your taxpayers money uk . 
  if you see breaking human rights no matter what profession you are : guard , police officer , judge or shopkeeper , you have ** moral and human obligation ** to act / minimum - report it and do n't participate . 
  mutual accountability = working judiciary system . 
  someone that attacks police officer is no longer civilian . 
  he/she becomes an attacker and lawbreaker . 
  basis of democracy is trust in your judiciary system - behaving like mongol horde should have consequence . 
  i 'm polish and i dont think that german police is intolerant or aggressive . 
  as law abiding citizen if anyone have something to say about validity or methodology of arrest they can report it to `` police internal affairs '' or `` human rights ombudsman '' . 
  you mean people interfering in official police arrest - hopefully as many as necessary , and no more . 
  good job germany .
