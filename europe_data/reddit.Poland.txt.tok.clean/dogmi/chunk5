  crazy how usa , eu , gb , australia , nz , izrael , india , media are all wrong - and that 's what i call `` crazy '' conspiracy , 
  have funn in russia \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449 . 
  our `` oligarchs '' are not as oppressive as russian ones . 
  look at quality of life in our corrupt western countries . 
  poles have nothing against russian people - that part is just my opinion based on my souraudings . 
  corrupt russian government : [ corruption_in_russia - wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_russia ) [ bbc opinion ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/vladimir-putin-corruption-five-things-we-learned-about-the-russian-presidents-secret-wealth-a6834171.html ) [ business-anti-corruption . com ] ( http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/russia ) ( ... ), 
  people from communist system that were sending innocent people to jail are still ( after more than 20 years ) on the same positions in our judiciary system - to fix it we have to clean it first . 
  majority of poles have chosen pis - and pis to say the least , dislike tusk . 
  that 's all . 
  i dont care about his grandfather , but about his political and economic vision of poland . 
  po does not represent interests of poland - that is why they lost the elections . 
  ( post soviet corruption just like in our judiciary system ) . 
  he does n't work in cooperation with polish government and for polish economic interest . 
  that in my opinion makes him at least a `` non patriot '' . 
  in poland we ( majority of poles ) see him as a german pawn . 
  & nbsp ; ps . 
  there is nothing wrong in that germany are trying to improve economical situation of it citizens - but polish politicians should do the same thing - thats why we ( together ) created european parlimen - to have place where we can discuse future of our countries . 
  i 'm afraid so . 
  to make long story short : polish gov. 
  no longer want to be german gastarbeiter but equal partner . 
  especially after brexit . 
  in poland we do n't appreciate traitors / [ volksdeutsche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksdeutsche#volksdeutsche_in_german-occupied_western_poland ) like donald tusk . 
  no problem - i appreciate your honesty . 
  just wanted to emphasize that poles have nothing against , honest and hardworking russian people . 
  ( our `` hate '' is oriented towards corrupt overlords of russia ) . peace . 
  to be precise : we hate russia 's tyrannical government that is based on : oligarchs + fsb ( kgb ) . 
  jesus is our king - we can manage anything .

  i like his attitude - [ america first ] ( http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/trump-america-first.jpg ) - very patriotic ( as it should be ) . 
  10/10 annoyed, 
  majority of poles are extremely proud of all parts of our country - nature , culture , architecture , history .

  great to hear that . 
  so lets go back to basics : * stop calling it refugee crisis . 
  * militarize borders . 
  * deport all illegal economic migrants . 
  create `` eu immigration detention facilities '' just like autralia did -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_immigration_detention_facilities, 
  respect our laws . 
  respect european values and culture . 
  & nbsp ; we dont have problem with feeding or clothing refugees . 
  the problem is that they refuse to integrate into fabric of our societies ( and we cant force them ) . 
  & nbsp ; if you dont want to integrate =  deport, 
  stop calling it refugee crisis . 
  militarize borders . 
  deport all illegal economic migrants .
