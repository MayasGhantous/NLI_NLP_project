well , having 6000 usd per capita is n't great . 
  i 'm starting to like neonazis . 
  no , there was not a single poll where he had 13 % . 
  ok , ok , they were having sex , it wo n't happen anymore , it 's all fine . 
  but ... do they at least wear underwear now ? 
  phone polls always gave us awful results , way worse than the support we actually got when voting time came . 
  only direct polls are credible . 
  and they clearly say - 10 % . 
  that 's why he got 7.2 % votes ? 
  just because he is n't russophobic , it does n't mean he is russia 's puppet . 
  it 's the other way around - russia 's puppets talk shit about russia so nobody thinks they are their puppets . 
  korwin is suspected to be putin 's puppet , does n't mean he is . 
  the greens are . 
  will i go to prison for using the word `` untermensh '' ? 
  f * ck the eu, 
  yes, 
  what do you think of szumi ? 
  oooh , or the third reich . 
   the polish guy who talks shit about russia < 3, 
  oh yes . 
  i should be able to get insurance or not . 
  if i do n't , and do n't save up money , and eventually get cancer ( lol ) then that 's my fault . 
  it 's my risk , my fault . 
  it 's not up to you to decide how i will spend my money . 
  besides , i do n't care what is going to be in forty years . 
  i do n't have money right now . 
  i am retarded because i want to be able to spend my money however the f * ck i want ? 
  that 's some nk logic right there !, 
  how can you possibly think that paying for all the hospitals + the tax collector , the officials and the directors is cheaper than paying for just the hospitals ? 
  and we go dead because of how long we need to wait for surgery ( which is shitty anyway ) . 
  i ca n't afford it because i am forced to pay 50 % of my income for the shitty public healthcare which i will never use because i prefer to die lol, 
  oh yes , but you are forced to pay 50 % of your earnings for the awful public one . 
  yes , but we all are forced to pay for the public one , which is absolute shit . 
  you wait a few weeks for some shitty doctor to tell you `` go to the hospital and have a surgery blah blah now stop wasting my time '' . 
  then you go to the hospital and get a date in 2020 . 
  then , finally , you can have the surgery and are forced to eat ...

  yes . 
  public hospitals in poland are ** absolute ** shit , everyone who can afford it goes to private ones . 
  and few people can afford it , because of the giant taxes we need to pay in order to keep public hospitals running ... and because there is no competition between public hospitals because they will receive money anyway - they are shitty . 
  but we need to pay for them . 
  and they are shitty . 
  it 's a shitty circle . 
  if there is one american thing that i want in my country , it 's private healthcare . 
  * only their necks . 
  the rest of them would be somewhere else ;d, 
  yes , yes , we all know you love every single islamist , now shut up . 
  fire free, 
  why ? 
  by invading ukraine , they wo n't attack neither nato or the eu . 
  and i honestly do n't care about ukraine . 
  if ukraine will continue trying to join the eu , russia will surely invade it . 
  all of it . 
  and what would ukraine pay with ? 
  potatos ? 
  `` russia bancrupt , europa rich !!!! '',

  oh , nothing interesting , really . 
  we just won some odd volleyball world cup with brazil and that 's it ... 
  to make fun of you , i guess . 
  i 've got a better idea . 
  let all the lazy f_cks starve and stop stealing my money !, 
  genius , is n't it ? 
  * knp supporter here *, 
  do you seriously think it 's a good idea to steal money from working people and giving it to lazy f * cks ? 
  there should be earlier elections . 
  what happened is bullshit . 
  exclude turkey and it 's good . 
  yes, 
  is n't it possible to escape from somalia ? 
  as opposed to nk . 
  like , i would prefer visiting north korea over somalia as a tourist , but i would prefer to live in somalia than in north korea . 
  stop oppressing me, 
  the polish army could actually easily stop russia for a few weeks somewhere east of warsaw . 
  the russian army is n't as strong as you might think . 
  add the nato forces already stationing in poland + russia would need to attack romania at the same time too , making their attack even less painful . 
  within that time , nato would surely react with a full scale counterattack . 
  mhm . 
  even though i have no idea what it is going to change , i think i want scotland to become independent . 
  just because i am bored and want something interesting to happen :d i think i 'm going to stay up all night too . 
  the referendum is tomorrow , right ? 
  when will the votes be counted ? 
  so what you are trying to say is that isis is my fault ? 
  lol, 
  i vote for knp , which is against any sort of benefits . 
  being forced to pay for somebody elses children ... 
  communism at its most barbaric !, 
  you are a thief . 
  stealing money through the government does n't make it any less bad . 
  you . 
  are . 
  a. thief . 
  edit : what f * cking idiot would defend any form of forced paid leave ? 
  god ... 
  that 's not / r/socialism either . 
  f_ck the employer , right ? 
  `` either ` social justice ' has the same meaning as ` justice ' -- or not . 
  if so -- why use the additional word ` social ? ' . 
  if not , if ` social justice ' means something different from ` justice ' -- then ` something different from justice ' is by definition ` injustice ' '', 
  it does .
