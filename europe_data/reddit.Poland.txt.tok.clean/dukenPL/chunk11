  why do you consider zlote tarasy horrible ? 
  skyscrapers are very aesthetically pleasing . 
  we already have a few praguelike cities like cracow and wroclaw . 
  warsaw is there to serve as a huge international metropolis . 
  we live in the xxi century . 
  this always is just obligatory . 
  perhaps we could team up with ukraine - they 've got the rockets and cosmodrome , we have the monies . 
  we did n't defeat the germans !! 111 !!!!!, 
  / u/ruzhanovskiy you do realize that there were lots of ukrainian guards in german death camps ? 
  i do n't see why it 's sad . 
  it 's very good that everyone can get enough calories to not be hungry . 
  people becoming fat is solely because they eat too much . 
  there 's been an experiment done where a guy ate only fastfood - but in proper amounts , counting calories - and actually lost a few pounds . 
  it 's you who gained the opposite . 
  we do n't have nearly as much reason to be friends with ukraine as ukraine to be friends with us . 
  so it 's just our * narrative * ? 
  in my cinema the people left just silently , without a word . 
  it is the best possible time . 
  ukraine needs allies now , and this is the best time to force them to give up on bandera . 
  yeah the ukrainian foreign ministry is so corrupted it participated in foreign film promotion . 
  edit : whoops i just realized i completely misunderstood you, 
  poland though , poland would be slammed like it happens every year on the 11th .

  `` thousands '' always sounds so good as long as you do n't mention that it 's about 3000 in a 10000000 country \u00b3\u2070\u2070\u2070 / \u2081\u2080 \u2080\u2080\u2080 \u2080\u2080\u2080, 
  there 's also a scene of polish villagers slaughtering an ukrainian man and his child, 
  and how is it even relevant ? 
  what are you trying to prove here ? 
  hopefully you are joking mate . 
  the issue is that their government [ recognizes the upa as national heroes . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hero_of_ukraine#controversial_awards ) the man directly responsible for the volhynian massacre , who [ gave the very order for it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dmytro_klyachkivsky ) has a [ statue built in 2015 in his memory ] ( http://rivne-cerkva.rv.ua/news/2443-arkhiiepyskop-ilarion-osviatyv-pam-iatnyi-znak-dmytru-kliachkivskomu-klymu-savuri.html ) and the ternopil oblast council [ officially called 2011 the year of dmytro klaczkiwski and jewhen konowalec , one of oun 's leaders . 
  ] ( http://stary.naszdziennik.pl/index.php?dat=20110416&amp;typ=sw&amp;id=sw05.txt ) he also has a statue in zbarazh , since 1995 , and in rivne , since 2002 . 
  not to mention numerous streets named after him in western ukraine . 
  of course there is no mention of it on his [ ukrainian wikipedia page ] ( https://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=uk&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fuk.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2f%25d0%259a%25d0%25bb%25d1%258f%25d1%2587%25d0%25ba%25d1%2596%25d0%25b2%25d1%2581%25d1%258c%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b9_%25d0%2594%25d0%25bc%25d0%25b8%25d1%2582%25d1%2580%25d0%25be_%25d0%25a1%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bc%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bd%25d0%25be%25d0%25b2%25d0%25b8%25d1%2587&amp;edit-text= ), 
  this is a great movie though , and certainly not anti ukrainian . 
  it shows the shitty sides of everyone , and is more about hatred than the massacre itself . 
  just a few days ago i watched the `` volhynia '' movie ( which i wholeheartedly recommend to everyone ) . 
  before the slaughter , there were scenes of banderovites gathered in forests forming a circle around a fire , waving upa flags ( the same ones you can see in the video ) and screaming `` slava ukrainie , death to the lach 's ( poles ) '' . 
  it really is terrifying seeing the same thing happening today . 
  it feels more like an american city than an european one . 
  i personally love it , but it really depends on what you expect . 
  i 'm in love with that city, 
  ... the us ranks 183th in population density ... 
  no argument here man :p, 
  you keep repeating `` your government '' . 
  it is n't my government . 
  [ king of the world ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_uhmpwq3oi0xgiw0xomnf09iodtsiz8zq.jpg ), 
  yes , our ministry of foreign affairs is retarded . 
  that 's not my ministry of foreign affairs . 
  that 's the ministry of foreign affairs of the majority of poles . 
  it 's ironic that it 's a german saying that official propaganda articles should be trusted . 
  . gov no thanks, 
  i will and i always did . 
  why do you try to dismiss me voicing my opinions here as * irrelevant * ? 
  wealth does n't come from donations , wealth comes from work . 
  we could be just as well off having free trade deals with europe while staying independent . 
  people do n't take euroscepticism seriously because it it euroscepticism !!!, 
  what are you even talking about mate ? 
  you are saying that we , eurosceptics , are bad because we do n't know what `` good '' the eu is doing , and that we are bad because when the eu is trying to let us know , we call it `` propaganda '' . 
  you fail to see the third , in my opinion best , option - disbanding the european union . 
  we do n't care whether it does or does not let people know what it does , we do n't want it to exist at all . 
  the minimum wage has increased because salaries have improved . 
  perhaps it 's because we do n't want that money taken from us at all ? 
  i support both the death penalty and decriminalizing suicide ( is that how i should call it ? ), 
  i do not understand how this can be forbidden currently, 
  how is it the best one ? 
  this sentence keeps getting repeated on democracy but it never gets backed with any arguments . 
  where are you from if i may ask ? 
  it was n't part of the world war . 
  well does n't feel like it to me . 
  i mean , looks like usual argumentation . 
  i 'm sorry for it , but i did it without knowing and might do it again ... without knowing . 
  what is shift flinging ? 
  not much to be honest, 
  how exactly are they the sole successor ? 
  the war would n't have ever happened if not for them . 
  it 's the communists ' crimes . 
  you ca n't say todays russia is responsible for these crimes or that it 's their crimes . 
  as long as they do n't praise those who did it , of course . 
  w. . . what ? 
  we 're not . 
  yet . 
  they started the war though . 
  even to their own people . 
  why is n't the holodomor talked about much anymore ? 
  the only theory i have is that some soldiers got drunk and shot it down for fun . 
  sounds stupid , yes , but not nearly as stupid as giving out such orders . 
  but what was the point in shooting it down ? 
  wo n't even bother . 
  you have no clue how sarcasm works . 
  punishing women for miscarrying is a cherry on top ? 
  are you joking ? 
  not only prenatal tests , but the protest organizers also lied about miscarriage being punished which is bullshit . 
  it does n't make the proposition okay , it does , however , make the protest untrustworthy and exaggerated . 
  they could n't because they always became social democratic shitholes, 
  you do realize that this never was even seriously considered to be implemented and is only a suggestion by a non government group ? 
  also , even if it would , have you even read it ? 
  have any of you ?
