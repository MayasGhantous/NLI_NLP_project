  even in western poland , where i live , you can see billboards saying `` ukrainians for work , cheap , call us ! '' . 
  i feel really weird reading such things , but at the same time oddly satisfied . 
  i live in a village with quite clean air and do n't really feel the difference when in the gop for example . 
  how do i know whether it 's polluted or not ? 
  what will standing on train tracks really kill you ? 
  lol, 
  i always like comparing poland to hungary . 
  it 's kind of like brothers competing . 
  do you seriously call venezuela capitalist ? 
  i mean ... fucking seriously ? 
  state interventionism can not increase the efficiency of the market . 
  you should really stop being so delusional, 
  they did not become rich through state intervention , they became rich despite state intervention . 
  yeah that 's absolutely how the east got so insanely rich after the war compared to the west !, 
  yeah but history has proven that the more capitalist a country is , the richer it is . 
  google public data explorer is amazing . 
  there ca n't be capitalism without competition . 
  `` capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] characteristics central to capitalism include private property , capital accumulation , wage labor , voluntary exchange , a price system , and ** competitive markets ** . '', 
  does n't have anything to do with capitalism . 
  capitalism is more than just operating with capital . 
  what is capitalism where there is no private property and no competition ? 
  i think you are, 
  are you being sarcastic ? 
  oh i 'm sorry it 's not as bad as it could be . 
  i do n't think i understand you mate . 
  i would n't ever go there and treat what they say seriously . 
  most of them are rich american kids raised in capitalism without a purpose in life . 
  well , they found their purpose in communism . 
  after one day of living in an actual communist country like nk or venezuela they 'd become the most devoted capitalists ever . 
  i recently browsed r/communism for the term `` venezuela '' . 
  there are posts there from a few years ago where they praise the new communist government there and predict venezuela to be in a golden age within a few years . 
  lol . 
  [ this one ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/35l9st/venezuela_to_nationalize_food_distribution/ ) is especially hilarious [ also this one ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1cda7j/maduro_wins_elections_on_venezuela/ ), 
  wow poland 's gdp really skyrocketed after joining the eu https://i.gyazo.com/ca4e23e0dace6683e692796f9f0f0f52.png, 
  it is legit . 
  basically , capitalism vs socialism . 
  nothing surprising here . 
  why would they have to pay more ? 
  so you 're saying that you are n't really russophobic , you are just a normal moron . 
  alright . 
  i know you and know very well how russophobic you are . 
  i have trouble understanding your question, 
  oh i 'm sorry you 're right . 
  turns out there was no ukraine at all in 1654 . 
  i 'm sorry for the historical truth . 
  i dislike russia but i 'm not russophobic . 
  well the germans had small states which later formed one . 
  same with italians . 
  do n't know about romanians and albanians though . 
  ukraine does n't have any history of unification . 
  there were no small ukrainian states . 
  it was just polish eastern and russian western land . 
  to this day we say `` ukraina '' ( not capitalized ) to describe the land , not the country . 
  historical sources !, 
  you putin bot !!!, 
  they came to existence either relatively early in history when there was still room for new countries or they are created artifically with the help of other states . 
  ukraine was the second type . 
  they only exist because russia created the basics . 
  you can not create a state out of nowhere . 
  and you really do n't have to act like an asshole, 
  kievan rus is n't it 's predecessor . 
  kievan rus is as related to today 's ukraine as ancient macedonia to today 's . 
  how would the ukrainian state come to existence in the first place ? 
  how would they have acquired this much land without russia ? 
  nothing to do with today 's ukraine . 
  it 's true though , there was no ukrainian state before russia . 
  is n't it worth attention ? 
  it 's at the very least educational . 
  oh yeah absolutely , there were not germans in germany back then , a new nation came from nowhere called the `` nazis '' and they invaded the country !, 
  did n't chmielnicki sympathize with russia ? 
  arguably the germans were ... :p, 
  and i apologized for that in the comments . 
  the cossacks joined russia willingly, 
  they only become generous after you stop being their neighbour and become their `` friend '' :d still , if not for russia , ukraine today would be the size of latvia . 
  who knows . 
  with other words , essentially create a police state, 
  * incident * the holodomor obviously was an * incident * too . 
  yeah, 
  did anyone , ever ? 
  why is it funny ? 
  * females *, 
  last time we wanted to be with you you killed a hundred thousand of us, 
  what does merkel even expect us to do after we take them in ? 
  keep them in concentration camps ? 
  of course they are all going to leave for germany . 
  there are 500 million of us , i 'm sore some do 2 . 
  there are 500 million of us , i 'm sure some do, 
  a bit late but ... want photos ? 
  you are trying to push a retarded way of thinking . 
  kinda like newspeak . 
  eliminate the possibility of thinking that taxes are theft . 
  so that people would only discuss in leftist categories - not whether we want to lower taxes , rather - what do we want to spend them on . 
  you communists have been trying to do this for the last 150 years . 
  it wo n't work . 
  same with the left-right spectrum . 
  put communists on the far left end , and ( national ) socialists on the far right end , and there is no more room for capitalists . 
  way to argue , yeah, 
  so the dog followed his body all the time ? 
  you take that back,
