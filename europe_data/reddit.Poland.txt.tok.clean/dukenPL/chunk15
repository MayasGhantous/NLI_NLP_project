  how does the dog know that his owner is in there, 
   nobody is forced to do anything  pay pit or go to prison, 
  the concept of universal healthcare is that private people are forced to fund cancer treatment, 
  and with an `` adequate healthcare system '' it 's god who has to fund it ? 
  where do you have a society that depends on private charity ? 
  why ca n't they just sing modified versions of legia warszawa to najlepszy klub !, 
  chuj mu w dzi\u00d3b !, 
  how ? 
  if you think that it 's catholicism keeping us from legalizing same sex marriage , you 're delusional, 
  source ? 
  it 's not new that germans are extremists . 
  oh hell , sorry guys you 're right , this really is just camouflage . 
  i have seen this on facebook and just posted it without thinking . 
  i thought communism was the deadliest ideology in the history of mankind , but what do i know . 
  anarchocommunists are just guys who want to destroy shit, 
  unfortunately ? 
  true , but that 's more or less what the whole early education process is . 
  we know ( or at least think we do ) what 's good for our children and teach them that . 
  they do n't even know they are socialists . 
  they are just stupid and vote for whoever promises the most `` free stuff '' and they do n't really care about the government first taking their money . 
  small children frighten you ? 
  we did it too :d :d our government wanted a common border with hungary really badly, 
  and we now are the two villains of europe !, 
  upa were nazis themselves , uncomparably worse in their methods than the germans . 
  and they did cooperate with each other . 
  you called me no different from bandera or szuchevych ... who were nazis . 
  so one can not be against nazism unless they are a. . . nazi themselves or are paid by russia ? 
  built entirely thanks to russia ? 
  `` especially ukies and poles ** against each other ** '' way to diminish the attrocities commited by ukrainian nationalists . 
  you guys can downvote him all you want but there is one thing you should think about . 
  last year `` modern , free '' ukraine decided to call the upa ** national heroes ** . 
  for criticizing national heroes in ukraine you go to prison . 
  just ... just think a moment . 
  imagine being an ethnic minority in a country which puts people in prison for criticizing murdererd of ethnic minorities . 
  imagine that . 
  what kind of heroes do they even have , bandera ? 
  edit : nevermind , just played cs go and been matched against a guy named `` ukrainian cossack '' who had an upa flag in his avatar and on his profile a link to a website starting with `` banderovite ... '', 
  but could i choose the same country ? 
  if so , i would . 
  i 'd just prefer being born in warsaw than where i was . 
  if i could n't , i 'd choose that country that has the best immigration deal with the us . 
  the post should be flaired as staged ... 
  hate nightmares though . 
  fun fact : 98 of the last 100 posts on / r/polska were in polish , and 98 % of polands citizens are polish !, 
  much fun !, 
  are ? 
  funny that it 's an ukrainian saying it . 
  should i hate you all because your government praises bandera ? 
  you are hilarious . 
  you remind me of one politician . 
  `` the market can only be free if it is strongly regulated ! '', 
  is warsaw the only capital you have ever seen ? 
  :d i love warsaw but that is for its history , it 's not particularly pretty unless you are looking at the skyline . 
  \u015awiat wed\u0142ug kiepskich is insanely good, 
  i 've seen a video like that on youtube but it was kind of justified given the context . 
  during that period being that times sweden barely meant not killing those who are different, 
  lol i live right next to it, 
  https://youtu.be/vteexsaqvyu enough said, 
  my grandfather , from what he tells me , was n't fond of them either because , at least the ones he knew , were arrogant assholes . 
  his family , however , managed to save a jewish girl from the ss . 
  i 'm saying this because , yeah , most people disliked jews ( not without reason ) but that does n't mean they wanted to kill them or anything like that . 
  my family risked their life to save one of them , because in poland hiding jews was punished with death . 
  great fucking idea ... let 's fight against religious extremism with government extremism ... 
  dying in a car accident or getting shot or anything like that does n't scare me . . dying in a hospital does . 
  it scares me so much that i am seriously thinking about looking for death after i am 60 or so . 
  with their women , this is the only way it can get hot in germany * and that is polish humor *, 
  oh he meant on the article ... for some reason i thought he was talking about reddit comments . 
  where do you see such comments ? 
  you generally do n't ask for gifts . 
  saying i believe stalinist propaganda is a joke , is n't it ? 
  hahaha witcher is so good because it is polished gagaggagahahahahahhahah, 
  let 's kick the british out of poland !, 
  in short , democracy fucked us over . 
  we were a superpower a few centuries ago , then democracy came and we were destroyed by our monarchist neighbors . 
  they stayed in power for just a few years in the 90 's and have later been replaced with pro european communists , who are just as shit as the former ones , but ... 
  they are different people . 
  absolutely , i was talking about the russian communists . 
  i am browsing reddit while almost being asleep . 
  took me a while to understand that it 's not team gigabyte . 
  every . 
  time . 
  you are insanely russophobic . 
  it was n't , it was a `` gift '' to buy over the nation . 
  exactly the same as uw . 
  it in general looks stunning when looking at it from the river at a low altitude . 
  wow this looks just insanely beautiful, 
  it already plays such a role . 
  you have got modern skyscrapers and the pkin right next to them . 
  shows how much the city has progressed since the communists lost . 
  true , vaduz is hilariously small though . 
  what is wrong about it looking like an american city ? 
  the filthy capitalist skyscrapers around it are more anti-communist than anything we could 've put up there , 
  the university of warsaw should be destroyed too because it was founded by the tsar ? 
  perhaps we should blow up all of warsaw ? 
  what about wroc\u0142aw ? 
  german city !, 
  they are all still quite close to the center . 
  but the idea is to stop the pkin from dominating the skyline . 
  i personally love that building , it has awful history but today it is insanely important to keep the spirit of warsaw alive . 
  in the 90 's there were a lot of voices to demolish it but i find it good they never did .
