  programs like 500 + and mieszkanie + are full blown communism . 
  you forgot yours at the end of your flair . 
  how is pis right wing ? 
  very weak when it comes to real power . 
  only a tiny representation in the parliament from part of kukiz ' 15 . 
  they are small , however they also are very vocal . 
  man i 'm currently playing it on an athlon 5200 + , you do n't know pain :d my old pc had a 4670k and gtx 970 and i remember it running really well, 
  cities skylines is one of the best games i 've ever played . 
  barely runs on my current but i absolutely love it . 
  i 'm seriously considering buying a stronger processor just for this game . 
  that feeling when you build a real , working public transport system beats everything . 
  it 's unfair !, 
  do n't think it 's pointing at jerusalem, 
  not aware of any towns , but the main road/street/route in warsaw is called jerusalem avenues,

  favorite food ever, 
  today 's europe civilized ? 
  you kidding ? 
  he is totalitarian , but , thank god , in no way communist . 
  wat ... how is putin a communist ? 
  [ they even have a little poland !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland,_maine ), 
  i hate american healthcare , it 's crap . 
  you can but that would force me to make american jokes and that would n't be nice, 
  thank god she failed . 
  and she 'll fail now too . 
  wo n't stump the trump . 
  is n't it immoral ? 
  yes but it 's hard to imagine two lines so close ... 
  wish we had that in warsaw :(, 
  how is one metro stop more useful than the other ? 
  might be longer for europeans to reach their destination but it 's a lot more convenient, 
  against it . 
  the only reason the eu can not currently force us to , for example , take in refugees , is because it does n't have an army . 
  creating an eu army is pretty much giving away our independence for good . 
  jablotron what a hilarious name for a smartphone, 
   i already have a bachelor 's in social science , minor in leadership , and a certificate in wind energy tech . 
  i hope that helps me get my foot further in the door in europe lol , basically how to be unemployed . 
  what did you expect mate ? 
  people like you major in worthless courses , obviously do n't find a job and end up working in mcdonald 's then demanding higher minimum wage . 
  you 've got only yourself to blame , not the united states of america . 
  same thing the [ cursed soldiers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cursed_soldiers ) did . 
  omg , i just realized what `` benelux '' stands for ... 
  strongly against , would join armed resistance movements . 
  i 'm sure there 'd be plenty of them . 
  i either hitchhike or go by train . 
  trick ? 
  where 's the trick ? 
  and of course whataboutism . 
  very legitimate . 
  islamophobia is very legitimate , `` muslimophobia '' not so much . 
  i love namyslow . 
  it 's rather cheap but great . 
  the cheapest good beer for me . 
  i want that so badly in poland . 
  all humans are , i think :d except for muslims and some other religions of course . 
  alright bye , you 're never going to admit you 're wrong . 
  whatever , i guess . 
  did you even read his works ? 
  the very introduction to his arguably greatest piece , dziady part iii : `` poland for half a century now is a sight of ongoing tyranny '' `` the history of poland 's martyrdom . . '' `` russian government 's hate towards poles ... '' `` all of galicia has been turned into one giant torture of poles ... '' `` to save the polish language and nationality ... '' `` the emperor 's rights left for poles ... '' `` what are all of todays attrocities compared to what the polish nation has to endure '' `` crying about poland ... '' my quick translations . 
  i just picked up the book from the shelf and started reading . 
  that 's from one and a half pages ... not a single time does he mention the lithuanian nation . 
  now from pan tadeusz , the first pages : `` you defend cz\u0119stochowa ... '' `` ko\u015bciuszko in cracowian ... '' `` to throw the three regimes out of poland with this sword '' `` to hear d\u0105browski 's mazurek '' `` still in polish dress '' it 's like ... how can you even argue with that ? 
  where did he say he was lithuanian ? 
  and do n't even bring up `` lithuania , my motherland '' because that 's obviously stupid funny thing that mickiewicz 's wikipedia page in every single language says he was polish . 
  except for the lithuanian one :d, 
  again you keep saying that all the facts say he was polish and he thought of himself as of a pole but he was lithuanian anyway . 
  yeah . 
  it 's quite funny how eastern eu is considered poor while you have countries like ukraine and moldova right next door, 
  i know it 's there but i have absolutely no clue what 's there . 
  he only thought of lithuania as a province of poland , not as a country . 
  so difficult ? 
  it 's hard to see if you are saying this seriously or just making fun . 
  basically you 're saying that all the facts say he was polish and he also considered himself polish but be was lithuanian anyway . 
  lol . 
  ... written in polish ... 
  he referred to lithuania as a province of poland , not as a country . 
  at every moment when it comes to nationality he mentioned poland . 
  everything was about poland . 
  like , if he had been born in pomerania , he 'd write `` pomerania , my fatherland !, 
  you are like health ! '', 
  another european country, 
  these countries are still way more capitalist than most other states . 
  removing the `` public sector '' would make them even more capitalist - thus richer . 
  but do you really want to get me started on sweden ? 
  i 'm sorry for history being on my side . 
  you want me to give you examples of failed socialist states ? 
  open the list of socialist states and take any of them . 
  socialism is never beneficial . 
  it always only destroys . 
  it 's a fact . 
  has been proven a million times both by capitalists and , what 's funny , socialists . 
  comrade sanders does n't know shit about the economy . 
  perhaps we 're the only one who have experienced actual socialism . 
  looks like none of you do . 
  of course they will be uneducated . 
  of course ... 
  there is no good way to use tax money . 
  and we all pay for it ourselves . 
  and no , poor people will be able to afford education .
