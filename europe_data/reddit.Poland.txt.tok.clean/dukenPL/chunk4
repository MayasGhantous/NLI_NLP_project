  - yes . 
  nah , not really in the mood today . 
  i am saying something completely different . 
  i do hate russia , but it is of no danger to the west right now . 
  russian bots pretend that their country did n't break international law - it obviously did . 
  kostroma is a city in russia . 
  the paratroopers come from there . 
  that 's not the place of the shooting . 
  it has been nowhere said this happened in a city . 
  in fact , on some other source i did read that `` the location is unknown '' which makes it even less believable . 
  seriously , who would stand next to a battlefield just looking at it , from a distance from which it is possible to see such details ? 
  i could say that the fact that your posts match those of martians should be alarming . 
  i am ** not russian ** . 
  i am fully polish , how many times do i have to repeat that ? 
  like , i say something about that situation , and you just wo n't believe me because there is the possibility that i am a russian troll . 
  yes , there are many russian trolls on the internet , i encountered a few too . 
  but i am not one of them . 
  question is : who would let this information out ? 
  unless there is some proof - to me it 's just another propaganda story from the ukrainian government . 
  just from a logical point of view : if they would join nato now ( they obviously wo n't , but just hyphotetically ) russia would immediately launch a full scale invasion of ukraine , at least to kiev , creating a seperate country ( novorussia ... ) between them and nato . 
  that 's an obvious move . 
  and that would be suicide for ukraine . 
  should i say `` we all '' ? 
  that would mean have this terrible phobia too . 
  i do n't . 
  they can invade any country they want , as long as it is n't in nato or the eu . 
  ukraine was , is , and always will be a shithole , and we are in literally ** no way ** obligued to help them . 
  yet we did . 
  what did they do ? 
  ban our meat . 
  ah , and russia banned our fruit . 
  great . 
  nobody threatened any nato country . 
  the usa does n't want to `` unban '' our apples either , should i want to declare war on them ? 
  obviously , this whole crisis in the east was caused by the eu promising impossible things to ukraine . 
  now seriously ; do you really think i am russian ? 
  i ethnicaly come from somewhere around ukraine ( and by that i mean kresy , not that pseudo-country . ), 
  but lived my whole life in silesia , speaking polish , thinking in polish , being a polish nationalist . 
  i am a member of one of the most patriotic parties in the country . 
  do you still think i am russian ? 
  my russian - zdrstwuitie, 
  but i am anti-russian . 
  i want russia to boom . 
  but what we see here is that the whole europe became russophobic without reason , it feels kind of like you all did n't have war for so long that you actually started missing it ... kinda like the german society during ww2 . 
  i 'm sorry for following logic . 
  it does n't even matter . 
  it 's not `` occupied crimea '' . 
  it is n't ukraine anymore . 
  it 's just russia , ukraine will never get it back . 
  they should be glad if they will be able to keep the eastern oblasts , which i highly doubt . 
  like , if germany would right now attack us ( do n't treat this seriously , it 's just an example ) and take silesia , getting absolute military and political control over it , officially claiming it their land , without any polish military presence , there is no way of calling it `` occupied silesia '' . 
  it 's just germany , or simply silesia . 
  as usual . 
  poland was ** way ** older than prussia . 
  there was 90 % russians on crimea . 
  it 's not `` occupied crimea '' . 
  it 's russia . 
  nobody will be next , lol . 
  nobody is threatening poland , people are just russophobic . 
  if i 'd be putin , i would do the same thing at this point . 
  http://screenshu.com/static/uploads/temporary/dk/wy/vf/paqjqm.jpg these southern countries are so odkfpsokfsdxvm , pdo ,, 
  orban - literally hitler ( i always wanted to say that towards a leftist lol ), 
  you are so incredibly funny , i ca n't stop laughing . 
  that 's a lie . 
  what he says is quite obvious , and only an idiot would have difficulties trying to understand it . 
  you try to put his logical views against him . 
  not going to work , 2 % : , 
  that feel http://screenshu.com/static/uploads/temporary/ou/s8/lb/xxsb7n.jpg, 
  natemat , the most reliable source on the polish internet . 
  period . 
  he created his own charity for people with some disabilities . 
  but no media said anything about it . 
  that 's a lie . 
  our dear leader wants to stop people from treating them like `` worse humans '' . 
  he considers himself a cripple too , because he is old . 
  overall , he is against dividing people in `` cipples '' and `` normal '' . 
  we believe everyone has some areas where he is better or worse . 
  just because you do n't have legs , does n't mean you are worse . 
  you are different , and should start focusing on the stuff you do good , and not the stuff you are awful at ( physical sports ... ), 
  and they want to kill cripples !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  oh my god , just not knp !, 
  they hate women and love russia !, 
  i do n't know who is worse , po or pis . 
  it would n't guarantee it 100 % , but certainly we would feel a lot safer . 
  another thing i want is a relatively strong ukraine ( weaker than us though , obviously ) that is not part of neither nato nor any eastern pact , and absolutely hates russia . 
  being on the border of a strong military pact is bad , but being surrounded by it is even worse . 
  sry no schengen for romania, 
  while i absolutely do not feel any danger from the russian side , i would like to have some nato bases in poland . 
  just so whoever would want to attack us would know that he has to directly attack american forces . 
  still , i believe we should have some atomic bombs independently of nato . 
  atomic weapons guarantee peace . 
  anonymously tell the police . 
  such people have no place in europe . 
  period . 
  this is hilarious xdd, 
  mhm . 
  we 'll have 15 % in the parliamentary elections . 
  he only had it because he promised the legalization of some drugs . 
  we never bragged about it , treating it like something absolutely obvious , than grown up people can decide about themselves .
