  i 'm also not saying the west or ukraine did it . 
  that is the most neutral view i can imagine . 
  i did read a bit about it , and it is basically something that everyone who knows how to use a pc could operate , + there is a tutorial ( two , actually ) . 
  `` next you 'll say russia was n't in crimea and it did n't get annexed '' i clearly said that i 'm not pro-russian . 
  well , russia is a superpower , and if the west would intervene ( what you are implying ukraine wants to happen ) this could really start a big , big war , one in which ukraine would have the same role poland had during ww2 . 
  which is basically a big battleground between superpowers . 
  yeah , that 's the most likely what happened . 
  still , even if it 's true , i am strongly against blaming russia for this tragedy . 
  the only thing russia could 've done against it is annexing all the eastern cities full of rebels , but that would be an even worse scenario . 
  well , there is a very small chance that ukraine wanted the west to react a bit more than just `` oh you bad boy putin ! '' . 
  but that 's very unlikely . 
  also , why would russia do it ? 
  that 's also very unlikely , and without much sense . 
  i guess it was just a random pissed off rebel who did n't fully understand what he was doing . 
  but you have to remember that the rebels are ** not ** supported by russia . 
  do you really think that russian killed kaczynski ? 
  really ? 
  i guess the term `` russian '' contains all these things in one word . 
  now seriously : we ** do n't ** know who did it , at least yet . 
  i am ** not ** pro russian , i 'm just saying that we do n't know that . 
  ukraine did some bad stuff lately too , and we just ca n't judge about it that early . 
  lol ? 
  i did n't say it 's true or not , i just said that he is too hasty with judging what happened . 
  lol ? 
  i did n't say it 's true or not , i just said that he is too hasty with judging what happened . 
  13 % in one of the latest polls . 
  third political power in poland . 
  it 's just ukrainian propaganda , we do n't know if it 's true or not . 
  pis is n't eurosceptic . 
  kaczynski signed the lisbon pact , and they demanded a strong european army . 
  the only big polish euro-sceptic party is knp . 
  this is n't a conspiracy ; these green idiots actually believe in it !, 
  how do you know it 's not the 97 % which is paid ? 
  and the remaining 3 % is outside of the countries that accepted these idiotic pacts . 
  the global warming is caused by a natural cycle not huuuumaaaaans, 
  aaaand we 've got an ecofreak !, 
  he knows english quite well comparing to some other polish politicians , 
  just a small correction : the eu does n't have anything to do with freedom of movement , it 's a seperate thing called schengen . 
  you can be in the eu and not have schengen ( uk ) or not be in the eu and have schengen ( switzerland ) . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with the eu . 
  let 's be honest , nasa is nasa , we can trust nasa . 
  so far every big investment made by the polish government was just in order to steal money . 
  poland is too small and too poor to have any real space program . 
  and it 's not that i do n't care about astronomy . 
  i really do . 
  but , man , it 's obvious that anything done by the polish government is a scam . 
  i love the term `` modern economies '' , mr niggawemadeitohshit, 
  people voted for us , so you did n't enter the eu parliament . 
  ** that 's how democracy works . 
  we do n't care . 
  as long as that person does n't enter the parliament simply `` because he cut himself something '' instead of `` knowing a lot about politics , economy , history ... '', 
  ooh , more opportunities to steal money . 
  great !, 
  from this day you got ta call me a rabbit , because i want to be a rabbit . 
  if you do n't , you are a racist . 
  i love how hartman got massacred by our guy in here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prfaywqao80 just look at the `` score '' in the end : ddd, 
  yeah , for example szypula , ryfinski , or grodzkie :d, 
  we did n't sent palikots monkeys there , so we got that going for us , which is nice  just some of their spots :d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqeuffo5sag&amp;feature=kp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckcfj-zgnzi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34rcqjxrujq and the biggest idiot : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq93ozxlhy4 i mean , seriously , how stupid do they think people are , trying to convince them with these spots ? 
  well , they certainly did convince a lot of people . 
  to not vote on them :d, 
  context : 25 years ago , korwin-mikke was in the parliament . 
  he was the author of a resolution which published all the sb ~ ~ coworkers ~ ~ secret collaborators . 
  boni ( that slapped guy ) called him an idiot in tv for that , and then , a few years ago , he admitted that he was an sb coworker too !, 
  then korwin-mikke said that he will slap boni . 
  nobody thought he meant it literally . 
  but he did . 
  and i love him for that :d, 
  because everybody knows that `` everything becoming cheap '' had a terrible impact on poor china 's economy :(, 
  i wo n't even bother reading that leftism . 
  i will just citate the king : `` shoemakers union gets salaries raised , and shoes cost 100 e more , 120 e with tax . 
  carpenters union gets salaries raised and chairs cost 100 e more , 120 e with tax . 
  later , shoemaker 's wife buys shoes and chairs , carpenter 's wife buys shoes and chairs and both notice that everything rapidly becomes more expensive . 
  `` it 's a pity , maybe my husband will get another pay rise ... '' aah , and while we 're at it : `` the monkey is a much better voter than a socialist . 
  statistically speaking , given two options to choose from , a and b - the monkey is wrong 50 % of the time . 
  socialists , however , ale always wrong . 
  update : -12 . massacre accomplished . 
  go to china . 
  boom, 
  of course i 'm not one of his stupid supporters , i mean , who would support a guy who does n't change his opinion every month and consequently fights for what he believes in . 
  only an idiot would do that !, 
  i 'm sorry , but even if you do n't agree with him , you just ca n't call him stupid . 
  well ... korwinus-mikkus is so controversial that even she did n't want him in her fraction . 
  do n't . 
  call . 
  him . 
  may i know which polish party you support ? 
  i 've been on this sub for too long , and literally no arguments are accepted by the definitive majority of leftists here , only very few admit they are wrong . 
  i ca n't treat it seriously anymore . 
  now i basically just come here to laugh at their stupidity . 
  we - the citizens of eu, 
  i said one point - you ca n't do anything without registering it . 
  we pay huge ( and i mean 80 % - huge ) taxes , we ca n't decide if and when our children will go to school , we ca n't decide what they learn . 
  we must buy mandatory insurance . 
  we ca n't even decide if we want to use seatbelts or not . 
  it is good when people are being used , thanks to this everything is extremely cheap . 
  and i mean extremely cheap . 
  the american worker in the xix century was the most used worker in the world . 
  but the american worker was the first one to drive cars . 
  besides , we have slavery right now . 
  someone who wants to open a store , or just go sell anything , ca n't do it because of idiotic laws and taxes like pit , cit , vat and and needing to register it countless times .
