  2 months old account may be a hint ... but this childish arguments and cheep `` finger pointing '' . . i mean , at least try to do your work right man . 
  this is just crap trolling, 
  i belive those are different agreements you 're reffering to, 
  nope , tszemix is right . 
  poland have n't addapted euro as well thou we agreed that we do , but since no target date was set there 's litle to none intention to do it in near future . 
  nope , i do n't feel responsible for every onr organized stuff nor i see all the poles should take credits for such groups same way as i do n't see every ukrainian taking fall for local nationalist scumbags . 
  only semantical vise ( litle green men ) , 
  huh ? 
  since when we quit blaming everyone else for everything ( including other poles ... damn poles ruining poland !! ), 
  i 'm also curious if any other nation have french stereotypes have anything close to logic . 
  for us the french serotype is arrogance which could explain why you see french people as logical , 
  no idea what `` you people '' are siting in your head but do n't aligne me with your visions . 
  do n't throw rabel like medical marihuana vs montesquieu 's separation of powers system . 
  now go enjoy puting your words and issues into someones else mouth so you can play with this sweet concept of `` you people '', 
  wow `` some controversy '' , just legislative taking over juditical branch . . no bigy !, 
  do you even try to troll with any effect ? 
  you see any christian church officialy supporting this or they members going anty-gay crusades cuting heads ? 
  i 'm not stating it 's the only one but , as already stated in next post , there are official branch like salafizm that take the `` infidel '' part literally . 
  in comparision it would take one of official christian churches to go full-crusade \\ baptaize or kill any non christian to gain same effect . 
  it is followed my west far left atheists \\ agnostics \\ s, 
  those are not `` some '' crazy people that read koran on their own , misinterpreted it and went on killing spree . . this is based on official interpretations and ultra-conservative movements \\ official doctrines . 
  so yeah big difference between one nut job and organized religious movement . 
  that you react based on emotional stance , using heavily political altered arguments while flowing on bad emotions . 
  not the best fuel to be treated as partner in any discussion . 
  part of political spectrum where you see yourself does n't mather . 
  * i 'm so manipulated !, 
  * * pro german and basically steered by them * * president that passes on everything that his party give * * without all the protests because pis is n't funding them * - that 's actually rich !, 
  * tusk just fled from sinking ship ( poland ) * * no chance in talking to the lefties like that * you should also watch out for lizard man and nope , it 's not about you being conservative in your honest opinion . 
  it 's about taking any number of political originated adjectives to show adversary in bad light , create perception of particular event ( does n't matter which political narration is it ) . 
  that 's why your pr guy wet dream , and that why you feel poked by `` leftists '' all the time . . just keep up rage levels high or else party pr department will have no use of you, 
  did you tried not to be any party pr \\ communication specialist wet dream target audience ? 
  because you seems to eat every emotional \\ symbolic \\ adpersonam crap throwed your way . 
  * sinking ship ( poland ) * that 's great , enjoy your suffering for millions in internal poland of your dreams surrounded by enemies and monsters, 
  * i do n't hate gays but it 's really annoying * so you do n't hate them as long their pretend to be heterosexual in public or not openly gay ? 
  hint : before anyone would like to go sex parades , being openly gay equals being able to kiss or hold hands like you would do with your girlfriend . 
  you propose a law that would say '' no tax fee if inherited from family member in first line ( kids , wife , husband ) except if you 're rich then pay xx % because fuck you everyone 's equal in face of law except billionaire , fuck them '' ? 
  let me show you something then : * poland 's ambassador in germany , przy\u0142\u0119bski *** requested ** the screening of the ** propaganda ** film smole\u0144sk instead * for which i should provide : - source ( or it 's a gossip journalism ) is a must or else information has little meaning or value - the request and propaganda part . 
  first based on what second is an opinion ( it 's a crapy movie i grant you that , but it was not goverment 's or party initiative but a crappy movie attempt which happens to suggest same direction as current party has ) - show that we were trying to verify this at the embassy ( with result of such enquiry ) - link to actual explanation of `` to much jewish content '' as then you would found that whole logic behind this sentence was as in one of other comments here `` that is only half of a sentence and rather a poor translation . 
  the ambassador had written a letter to the director saying that the berlin department should n't overdo focusing on the meaning of the dialogue of the polish and jewish cultures as the main example of an intercultural dialogue in poland , and should put more focus for example on polish-lithuanian or polish-ukrainian intercultural dialogues '' you know those other nations which kind of also had a bit to do with polish history in short crappy journalism , no attempt to confirm sources , no context of the actual reasons or issue here . . just a cheap clickbait * `` director of polish institute in berlin fired for jewish content '' *, 
  i 'm not advocating our foreign office here , the article is crappy that 's it . 
  as you wrote , `` apparently '' . 
  there 's whole story here about some shady cleansing to push current government 's people wherever possible with some ruling party narration . 
  all i got instead is an article about `` removed cuz to much jewish stuff '' , a clickbait that can only divert whole discussion into good old stereotypes , people bashing each other or getting supper defensive in their holly wrath . 
  that 's bad journalism , sources not provided or checked to confirm . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polin_museum_of_the_history_of_polish_jews ) the place witch sole purpose is to show polish-jewish heritage and shared history . 
  we 're talking about polish institute in berlin which objective is to cover whole millennium of polish culture and history . 
  what we get in this lame article ? 
  a suggestion that one of the reasons to remove that lady from the office was `` too much jewish content '' . 
  what evidence are there to support such claim ( what was the actuall conntent , was something like that even said in the first place or was it part of any reasonable context and not pulled from some where 's ass for clickbait purpose ? 
  we do n't know !, 
  there 's nothing that would give any hint of suggestion or depth to this story . . 
  but hey !, 
  let 's just praise this garbage of an article with our attention and assumptions based on stereotypes . 
  ps : i 'm absolutely not a fan of my current government but intellectual level of some articles and discussion on this reedit is just ridicules . 
  does us and france has same living costs ? 
  polish household income is way lover than that by my living costs are also significantly lower than those in us or france . 
  it looks like you 're jumping to conclusions based on just part of the data for such quotation . 
  then again i 'm no expert so feel free to correct me . 
  it ' a the same potato and there 's only one for whole army . . such is life, 
  proxy war here , proxy war there . . what 's the fuzz about ? 
  [ know your history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ), 
  no you wont get two years . 
  duno where you 're taking this from but no judge would give 2 years for drunk stunt like that not now and not in the past was sentence like that given . 
  witch , with gentle touch of a mual , you see everywhere . . provoke comments like above then play `` much anti-polish '' card . 
  i appriciate the sentiment that pis voters = terrible people but i was mostly reffering to the style of your replies , and general shortsightedness spiced with some arrogance and selfishness, 
  wow . . well i was always wondering what on earth are tories doing with pis in same eu parliment group . 
  now i know , their voters are exacly the same . 
  there you go mate . . this is your fantasies about situations like that . 
   the 17-year-old told police she was targeted in the coastal town of sonderborg by an english-speaking man , who knocked her to the ground and tried to undress her . 
      it is unclear if the man was an asylum seeker or refugee . 
  gues that the last sentence has something to do with police report . . but i do n't know the source so it 's hard to judge if their bias or solid in terms of journalism . 
  yyou should teach that to all underage girls out there armchair general . 
  tell us something where you ever physically assaulted ? 
  were you ever in situation that you have to overpower far larger , determinate enemy with just few seconds to shake off shock and take initiative ? 
  even prior to that paper weekly and daily newspapers were decreasing rapidly up to the point ( would have to double chcek that number as it was 2005 ) when biggest daily newspaper was fakt with hoping 350k in 40 milion country . 
  could you define middle class then ? 
  if so we can use some statistics to chcek that . 
  in my opinion it was mostly middle class protesting . 
  it does exist same as jumping betwen subjects the moment your narrative got debunked . 
  and sudenly regular law overrides constitution . 
  fck you theory of law . . you know nothing and you 're a commie !, 
   pis was actively pro eu and is now you should double check that , pis was not an active supporter of eu accession as far as i remember . 
  i actually try to check it after going back home but as i remember this , they went all `` much sovereignty lost '' narration . 
  people like you are the best prove to support education reform . 
  tell me something what education you have in terms of political science , because poland is already full of smart asses using words that they actually do n't understand ant yet they know . 
  no `` in my opinion '' , never `` as far as i understand '' . . mowi\u0119 jak jest i chuj ( sorry for bit of polish ) . 
  whole country full of football trainers , political doctrine specialists . 
  absofuckinglutely without doubts on anything !, 
   if we wanted to invest we could do that better in germany . 
  thats why whole german delivery chain is in cee . 
  do n't worry also a gift , this time from cee . 
  it 's good to have a proper conversation as two well prepared economic experts with international law and business experience s /, 
   i 'd be angry at them for being richer that would be ridicules and i fully agree with you  i 'd blame them for looking down on me here the question would be `` do they look down at you ? '', 
  if yes then hell yeah you have all the right to be angry !, 
   hen we 'd expect to see massive growth rates in our countries and relatively minor , if any , in poland . 
  well this is actually a different topic that due to different reasons would affect both countries . 
  mainly tax avoiding . 
  danish company x having production in pl , but not paying taxes neither in poland nor in denmark as it 's actually based in i.e. , luxemburg . 
  point is both parties are benefiting but in different way , there are also non-economic factors and benefits of eu that this financial conversation is missing . 
  what 's happening instead is some people thinking that , due to cohesion funds , they own cee or can dictate them and cee should shut the hell up ( absolutely not the point of eu treaties ) and others think entitled toward we , and treat cohesion funds like some war \\ communism payment .
