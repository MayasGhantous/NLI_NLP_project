one question : are they believing leftists , or do they just pretend to believe the crap they 're saying like most of the politicians ? 
  if they 're believers , i 'm very happy - nothing discredits letfists better than gaining power . 
  well , here 's a quote from a polish encyclopedia from the 18th century :  southern american lands contain the most abundant golden ores , and gemstones , this division of nature was a cause of misery for americans , who are being destroyed and oppressed by the europeans ' unsatiated greed . 
  so i think the idea was n't so foreign to them . 
  there are plenty of poles in lithuania . 
  that 's why lithuanians hate them so much . 
  sure : http://zoba.to/-/re4lho/, 
  well , according to the same poll , 58 % regret that those cities are n't in poland anymore . 
  [ alizee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icz8r25hlfi ) here, 
  polish cities are so beautiful . 
  the opposite of buying ethnicism , obviously . 
  thanks for letting us know , it would be useful to see such infographics from other countries . 
  it looks like a clusterfuck though , all the top 3 parties seem to be hated by everyone . 
  why is that ? 
  and why is dps in isolation ? 
  what does `` ethnical party '' mean ? 
   german and english are much more similar being both germanic languages , which portuguese and greek are not . 
  yeah , he 's pretty much a radical leftist with a victim complex . 
  so where 's this fight ? 
  no it 's not . 
  no , rada comes from the german [ rat ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rat ) , also related to the english [ rede ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rede ), 
  yeah , i think the minister was advertising . 
  `` we can get you a job for 3 % of your salary , others will get you one for 10 % ! '' . 
  no wonder why his party is the biggest party in poland , despite having 5 % support . 
  these recordings are secret due to being a part of an investigation . 
  then why is he saying that he was beaten by the police and that he ca n't wait to show the video to the public ? 
  and it would n't happen because kaczy\u0144ski is n't that stupid . 
  oh , a lemming ? 
  do n't worry - the documents that are going to be released at the beginning of 2015 will destroy even your delusions . 
  why would n't i ? 
  `` gang of thugs with their barely legal privatization / commercial activity '' describes polish government too . 
   if in 90s-00s russian government has resembled a gang of thugs with their barely legal privatization / commercial activity same probably applies to ukrainian and polish governments . 
  not sure if you 're serious or not . 
  28,5 % of people 18-25 voted for him . 
  more like 2050s , if things do n't slow down . 
  where exactly ? 
  one of the theories is that the whole operation has been carried out by ... the presidential camp of our ruling party , which wants to weaken the government camp . 
  the president is heavily linked to our [ military intelligence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_information_services ) , which did some horrible things like illegaly trading weapons , multi-million scams , killings etc. 
  the secret services is who really runs this country . 
  not surprising , since in 1989 general kiszczak handed over the power to his agents such as lech wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  also , our interior minister said that they are donating money to some airports `` under the table '' so that they function . 
  he also said that the polish state `` only exists theoretically , in practice it does n't exist because it works with its particular fragments , not understanding that it 's an entity '' . 
  they also discuss a businessman who thinks they robbed him , that maybe they should `` rob him even more '' . 
  edit : and on another tape , one of our former ministers complained to another former minister that the tax office investigates his wife , to which the other guy said `` i know , i blocked it '' . 
  he did n't say that rape is women pretending to resist , he said that women often pretend to resist and that men need to know when the resistance is real . 
  he wrote a book about how to be a father 25 years ago and much of what 's there seems like the exact copy of / r/theredpill about that sperm quote , he later defended that it was just a hypothesis . 
   now as you may probably know , i 'm not what you 'd call politically correct , but jesus ... this man is bat shit crazy : no he 's not . 
  every person not poisoned by feminism knows that women often pretend that they do n't want it . 
   it 's conservative in a way we do n't have classic western-european left because people still associate them with communists . 
  sld was incredibly popular before the rywingate , am i wrong ? 
  the reason they 're not getting many votes now is mostly because the political scene has been taken over by our two supposedly `` right-wing '' parties . 
  why is it no longer acceptable to speak the truth ? 
  you ca n't deny that . 
  there 's a special place in hell for people linking to mobile versions . 
  some comparison : speech in czech : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknjhtck_d0 speech in polish : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paqngsm2fti speech in ukrainian : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnaeqh8chwu speech in russian : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_drqtqo3hv0 personally , it 's hard to me to hear the difference between ukrainian and russian . 
  i was n't asking seriously , i was just pretending to be a clueless american . 
   \u00df = vowel before is long  ss = vowel before is short < american mode  so before \u00df you pronounce i like in pine , and before ss you pronounce i like in pin ? 
  i think spanish is similar to polish in the sense that you always know how to pronounce a word from spelling , but not always know how to spell it from pronunciation . 
  there are pairs of characters that are pronounced the same ( rz-\u017c , ch-h , \u00f3-u , \u0105-on / om , \u0119-en / em ) . 
  americans think their constitution and law applies everywhere . 
  i need to start a new initiative . 
  i 'll name it `` europeans for tomorrow '' . 
  in our yt video i 'll say : `` great things are created by great people . 
  we need to look beyond our differences and start working together for the good of everyone . 
  we need to stop thinking about the past and start thinking about tomorrow . 
  we need to stop thinking inside the box and start thinking outside of the box . '', 
  our motto will be `` because it gets better for everyone '' . 
  who 's in ? 
   agnostic means `` do n't give a damn '' , right ? 
  because i was n't sure ... 
  yes , mostly . 
   someone who does not know , or believes that it is impossible to know , if a god exists http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/agnostic_1?q=agnostic, 
  dammit !, 
  there 's no american influence as far as i 'm aware , since no european country fears us invasion in case of non-compliance . 
  everything european politicians do is not because america forces them to , but because of their own free will . 
  okay , so let me ask - is poland a country ? 
  because it 's been legal here at least since 966 ad . 
  when does `` modern sense '' start ? 
  the first country ever where it was legal to have gay sex , right ? 
  except no . 
  it 's literally jim crow . 
  i was n't arguing against that , i was just arguing against the idea that lgbt rights are human rights just because gay people are humans . 
  i 'm born into a group of people who like conservatism , though most people around me do n't hate that . 
  pedophiles are humans too , does n't mean we need to create new rights with consideration of them or protect them from discrimination , so the logic of this argument is faulty . 
  why ? 
  because it 's all arbitrary . 
  if we ca n't discriminate against anyone , can we discriminate against incompetent people ? 
  we live in a democracy , so people actually can prohibit it . 
  i do n't know , you were saying something about a rule that says `` if people want to prohibit pda of two men , they have to do it also for all couples . '', 
  - so i 'm assuming you were talking about some sort of a god , because i do n't see anyone else who would enforce such rule . 
  i 'm not making anything obvious , i 'm 100 % sincere in what i 'm saying . 
  pretty much , that 's why i love poland . 
  as far as i know , there is no god 's law that says so . 
  so if people want to prohibit specifically two men from kissing , they can do so . 
  it actually is the case in many countries as far as i 'm aware - somehow nothing has stopped them . 
   you can perceive two men kissing differently than you perceive a man and a woman kissing , but that does n't change that the act is the same and in both cases actually , it does . 
  the only reason why male and female breasts are considered different is because people perceive it differently . 
  similar with homosexual and heterosexual couples kissing . 
  if two men kissing is the same as a man and a woman kissing , then why is the former disgusting to me while the latter is not ? 
  something is not right with your logic .
