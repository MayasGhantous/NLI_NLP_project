i remain glad i live in europe , but i live a short drive from what is so far the westernmost border of the russian empire . 
  russian troops could be at my front door almost unimpeded within minutes if that 's what they wanted . 
  all that keeps them from trying that shit is the thought that a us-led nato would immediately and decisively push back . 
  we do n't need a yammering fool in the white house . 
  i forgot to mention one of my favorite things about subtitles : you can easily ignore them if you know the film 's language , whereas you can not just ignore a voiceover or dubbing . 
  knapik has a great voice but * all * voiceovers suck compared to subtitles -- unless you ca n't see the subtitles , of course . 
  people who have bad eyesight or who watch tv while working ( including housework ) need to hear everything because they ca n't follow the subtitles . 
  but a serious film or show where you want to sit down and watch it ( and * hear * it ) with your undivided attention needs subtitles . 
  films like that are wrecked by mr voiceover 's narration hanging like a cloud between you and the sun . 
  [ there 's at least one polish doctor working in germany ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/polish-women-cross-border-to-germany-for-abortions-1.2754546 ) who provides abortions for a steady stream of polish women , but i have no idea how much it costs . 
   on this day , dr rudzinski says he has performed nine abortions , in a year of about 1,000 -- mostly for polish women . 
  [ fr\u00edge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frige ) :  frige , or frig , was the presumed old english name for a goddess found in anglo-saxon paganism , the religion that dominated anglo-saxon england from the 5th to the 7th centuries ce . 
  [ 1 ] there are no direct descriptions of this deity in surviving literary sources , but historians have drawn together indirect evidence from a variety of other sources , arguing that she was probably associated with sexuality and fertility by her worshippers . 
  following the christianisation of england in the 7th and 8th centuries , frige 's worship was eradicated , but she left an influence on the english language . 
  ** she lent her name to the modern english word `` friday '' , which came from the old english word friged\u00e6g , meaning `` frige 's day '' . 
  ** she also provided the basis for a number of place names across the country , including villages like froyle , freefolk and fretherne . 
  ( por . 
  czes . 
  because i worship the sun . 
  but also because we were talking about sunday and monday , so i continued the conversation from there . 
  polish is pretty simple compared to english , which confuses religions and shit . 
  something like : english | etymology | polish | etymology -- | -- | -- | -- sunday | sun day | niedziela | from `` nie '' ( `` no '' ) + work monday | moon day | poniedzia\u0142ek | from `` po '' ( `` after '' ) + niedziela ( `` no work '' ) tuesday | t\u00fdr ( son of odin ) + day | wtorek | from second wednesday | odin/woden 's day | \u015broda | from middle thursday | thor 's day | czwartek | from fourth friday | friggin fr\u00edge 's day | pi\u0105tek | from fifth saturday | saturn 's day | sobota | from sabbath, 
  with all those kilometers and slavs between them , how did finland and hungary end up with common linguistic ancestors ? 
   ignorant , slip of the tongue , an agenda , or being dumb . 
  [ people take that shit seriously here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22polish_death_camp%22_controversy#outlawing_use_of_phrase ) . 
   in august 2016 , the cabinet of poland , led by prime minister beata szyd\u0142o and her law and justice party , approved legislation that would outlaw the use of the phrase `` polish death camps '' . 
  it was expected to pass by wide margins in the parliament , also dominated by law and justice . 
  under the law , a person who uses a phrase such as `` polish death camp '' may be sentenced to up to three years in prison . 
  in rzeczpospolita , polish journalist jerzy haszczy\u0144ski wrote that when the phrase appears in foreign media , it `` insidiously suggests that our state and our people were responsible for german crimes '' , but he is unsure who the law targets . 
  `` almost every use of the phrase that i can recall ended with a profuse apology . '', 
  but not theirs . 
   and even at the time , they were called ` the germans ' . 
  the * bloody * germans . 
   there 's nothing wrong with picking a popular name . 
  especially since some of them never go out of top 10 that 's what i was saying . 
  if you go top 10 , make sure it 's been top 10 for a long time . 
  which are all perfectly fine names -- the very nice people across the hall from us now have very nice children named lena and olek -- but i wish people would not be so faddish about naming their kids . 
  the best method for naming your kids is still to pick a family name . 
  if you want old-fashioned , go back two or three generations . 
  if you want something snappy , lots of old names have perfectly good , snappy nicknames . 
  if you just ca n't face a family name -- because you do n't actually like your family ? 
  i do n't know -- at least stay away from this year 's top 10 , or use a top 10 name if it has been a top 10 name for at least a generation or two . 
  never pick this year 's fad . 
  i like `` grandma 's beach '' . 
  the wife 's family used to fly down to bulgaria for the beaches . 
   how do we know this is not fake news ? 
  [ a more reliable source . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/500000-euro-fines-for-fake-news-on-facebook-in-germany/a-36806244 )  the spd 's thomas oppermann has called for fines against social media platforms if fake reports are not quickly deleted . 
  a new law to control fake news and hate messages is under consideration . 
  and  `` if , after appropriate examination , facebook does not delete the offending message within 24 hours , it should expect individual fines of up to 500,000 euros ( $ 523,320 ) , '' oppermann told the weekly magazine . 
  furthermore , at the request of the people concerned , there should be some form of remedy or correction within the same range of value . 
  the world would be more eager to help refugees if they came with an agreement that they 're going home when it 's safe enough to go home . 
  it is as if they are being plucked from the water by a passing ship -- the passing ship is saving their lives from immediate danger , not inviting them to move into a cabin permanently . 
  they all need to get the fuck off the ship at the next port , even if one of their women has had a baby during the rescue . 
  poland ( and other eu countries ) should be able to take syrian refugees in , get general eu money to house and feed them , and then send the refugees ( including any kids born in the meantime ) back to syria when the immediate danger ceases . 
  if they want to stay , let them go home and make a formal application to return . 
  if another country wants to offer them a third place to go to , that 's also fine . 
  but they go . 
  i zink vee vill call zis place `` up to our necks ... 
  czechs are a lot less tolerant ( more racist , more xenophobic , etc. ), 
  than i had imagined . 
  fuck you , intolerant czechs . 
  see that north european plain ? 
  that 's why poland is a battleground . 
  mountains are hard .

  all of central/eastern europe : see the `` old city/market/square '' which may have been 100 percent destroyed during wwii but has since been carefully reconstructed and homogenized with all the facades and cobblestones you 'd demand of a tourist-quaint old city square . 
  i 'm here to fight the good fight .

  mnemonic : say ** hi ** to gand ** hi ** . 
   was getting disappointed when i saw scotland , ireland and uk but no wales . 
  that 's how the alphabet works . 
  not only that , it 's an elevator/crane thingy that was powered by humans in two very big hamster wheels . 
  it was built on the edge of the canal . 
  the guys would walk inside the wheels , causing the wheels to turn , causing the ropes to be wound in or wound out , thus raising or lowering the cargo to or from the ship docked under the crane . 
  a pretty regular crane except the motor was humans inside a hamster wheel . 
  he is obviously way too old to move anywhere now . 
  but if pensioners did want to move from germany to gdansk , i bet their pension money would go a lot farther . 
  the city was both , or all three , all at the same time . 
  it was german , it was polish , and it was independent . 
  the problems * always * come from certain absolutists who exaggerate the evidence for one side and downplay the evidence for the other side , so they can claim that the city is `` rightfully '' one thing or another . 
  the city is not `` rightfully '' one or the other , not based on history . 
  it just is what it is now . 
  the dice were tossed and this is how they landed . 
  no one should wish for those dice to be tossed again . 
  we are very lucky that we now have friendly relations and open borders in europe . 
  germans with danzig roots could come to live and work in gdansk , i think . 
  is there any obstacle to that ? 
  we will see . 
  one way or another , `` mass immigration to poland expected in the next decade '' is wacky . 
   `` mass immigration to poland expected in the next decade '' ha . 
  they would have to compete for scarce jobs with poles returning from the brexited uk . 
  and , of course , they would have to work for polish wages .
