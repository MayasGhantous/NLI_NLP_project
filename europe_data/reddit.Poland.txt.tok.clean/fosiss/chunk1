you watch too much tvn and tvp . 
  of course there are people like that , however i wouldnt say that they are majority . 
  our minister of interior is so amateur . 
  she get this position , because she is a friend of kopacz . 
  her main experience is being a deputy of polish parlament for 4 cadences . 
  she even doesnt have experience with special forces and as minister of interior you are responsible for that . 
  beside that her main experience is teaching in school . 
  they have start rebranding few months ago . 
  some people who were fully supporting po ( platforma obywatelska ) created nowoczesna.pl in the internet they are called po 2.0 . 
  this political party also has support of polish banking system , because of leszek balcerowicz ( he is famous for the balcerowicz plan ) this way people who wont vote for po , will vote for nowoczesna.pl and if they get to the polish parlament , they will for sure create a coalition . 
  guess why our current pm did n't complain . 
   anti-immigrant minority i would say pro-immigrant group is minority . 
  there are plans , some sources say it will be in 2024 , greenpeace claims 2031 ... we even have special company for this project , which is responsible for preparation ( localisation etc. ), 
  since 2009 . 
  they cost us ~ ~ defrauded ~ ~ already 43,3 mln eur . 
  lot of people say that this company is just a place for friends of politicians to get money , for doing nothing . 
  what happens if they are not granted asylum ? 
  does finland deport them to sweden or to i.e iraq ? 
  i wish poland has nuclear power plant ... 
  sorry for not narrowing down this to only western european countries . 
  no they arent , but in my opinion if we had less tax burdens on our heads , we could have more money to spent and than our yearly gdp growth would be higher . 
  no-go zones in sweden, 
  we see what is happening in ~ ~ european ~ ~ western european countries where muslims population is bigger than 1 % . 
  415 eur is minimal wage ... ( 306 after taxes , than if you subtract vat ( 23 % almost always ) , you are left with ~ 240 ) according to gus ( main statistics office ) the median salary is about 950eur ( about 670 after taxes and ~ 520 after vat ) . 
  they are not `` lazy '' in my eyes . 
  i do n't fully support neoliberal doctrine . 
  how can someone success , if his `` wings '' are undercut by regulations and taxes ( or tax office ) . 
  i would say poland was neoliberal country in the 90s , now it is guided by eu . 
  what ? 
  neoliberal ? 
  haha . 
  http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=376 ** the main points of neo-liberalism include : **  the rule of the market . 
  liberating `` free '' enterprise or private enterprise from any bonds imposed by the government ( the state ) no matter how much social damage this causes . 
  greater openness to international trade and investment , as in nafta . 
  reduce wages by de-unionizing workers and eliminating workers ' rights that had been won over many years of struggle . 
  no more price controls . 
  all in all , total freedom of movement for capital , goods and services . 
  to convince us this is good for us , they say `` an unregulated market is the best way to increase economic growth , which will ultimately benefit everyone . '', 
  it 's like reagan 's `` supply-side '' and `` trickle-down '' economics -- but somehow the wealth did n't trickle down very much . 
  i do n't remember them to follow this point . 
   cutting public expenditure for social services like education and health care . 
  reducing the safety-net for the poor , and even maintenance of roads , bridges , water supply -- again in the name of reducing government 's role . 
  of course , they do n't oppose government subsidies and tax benefits for business . 
  they do n't cut public expenditure either , they increase it . 
   deregulation . 
  reduce government regulation of everything that could diminsh profits , including protecting the environmentand safety on the job . 
  we have much more regulations . 
  oh wait , they are trying to deregulate access to some proffesions . 
   privatization . 
  sell state-owned enterprises , goods and services to private investors . 
  this includes banks , key industries , railroads , toll highways , electricity , schools , hospitals and even fresh water . 
  although usually done in the name of greater efficiency , which is often needed , privatization has mainly had the effect of concentrating wealth even more in a few hands and making the public pay even more for its needs . 
  they follow this point , however the number of bribes is enormous . 
  thats why they are called thieves in poland . 
   eliminating the concept of `` the public good '' or `` community '' and replacing it with `` individual responsibility . '', 
  pressuring the poorest people in a society to find solutions to their lack of health care , education and social security all by themselves -- then blaming them , if they fail , as `` lazy . '', 
  they do n't follow this point . 
  ** sorry man , but the only party which is liberal on the polish political market is korwin . 
   they are liberal conservatives . 
  no , they are not . 
  they pretend to be everytime before election time . 
  the next thing they do , is to increase taxes and reduce civil liberties . 
   this number comes on top of the initial scheme to relocate 40,000 asylum seekers , approved by parliament on 9 september and endorsed by the justice and home affairs council on 14 september the total number of people to be relocated is thus ** 160,000 ** . 
  actually they are already trying to get to poland through belarus . 
  http://kresy24.pl/72947/na-polske-ruszyla-przez-bialorus-lawina-uchodzcow-z-azji-i-kaukazu-horror-w-terespolu-to-czeczenski-dzien-swistaka/ chechens , armenians , georgians , kazakhs , azeris , kirghiz , tajiks - everyday at least 300 of them manages to get asylum seeker status in poland . 
  the problem with syrian refugees might be nothing in comparision with that , what is happening on polish eastern border . 
  `` almost none of them come to poland to work . 
  they know , they will get benefits for every child . 
  than they will go to germany , france , sweden and there the whole procedure will start again . 
  this way they can nomadize in europe for years '' - says the representative of law firm taking care of refugees . 
  ok , so we have pretty much 2 options here . 
  all poorer eu countries , increase social benefits to the same level as in germany/sweden or rich eu countries decrease social benefits to the same point as in poor countries . 
  of course increasing social benefits in poor countries is not possible , because people will stop working there . 
  you didnt read it either . 
  which one from 46 articles poland is not respecting ? 
  because those people dont want be here and will cause troubles for the police and locals . 
  they didnt want end their journey in poland . 
  do you think they will have initiative to learn a language in country where they dont want to stay ? 
  moreover , work here ? 
  they will be burden for our economy . 
  why should they stay and work in poland , if the amount of money they get from social benefits in germany is more than minimal wage here . 
  the thing is , poland wont have problem with people who are willing to stay there . 
  we dont need `` refugees '' whom , the first thought is `` how to escape this camp and get to west '' . 
  thats why i used the phrase `` concentration camp '' . 
  we are using about 800k ukrainians . 
  which article exactly ? 
   ( ... ) and urge them to stay in the country . 
  it sounds like a concentration camp . 
  which refugee convention poland is not respecting ? 
  what do you think about eu and their quotas ? 
  do you have ideas , how europe should solve problem with immigrants ? 
  probably because its about 200km away from the german border . 
  the source quotes rtl ; tagespiegel and europe 1 tv station . 
  poland follows dublin treaty . 
  few days ago there was a news about deporting immigrants . 
  https://etransport.pl/wiadomosc,38151,9_nielegalnych_imigrantow_zatrzymano_w_chyznem.html it 's in polish , but i 'll translate facts for you . 
  9 illegal imigrants were arrested in chyzne . 
  6 iraqis and 3 syrians . 
  during control it turned out , that they are crossing polish - slovakia border illegaly . 
  they did n't have any documents .
