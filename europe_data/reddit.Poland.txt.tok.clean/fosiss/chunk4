  however , how technically changing public service bill is against constitution ? 
   who has been changed during nighttime lately ? 
  i do n't know , thats why i 'm asking . 
   changing law thats what government do ? 
   chiefs of important offices in night who do you mean ? 
  you said it was against constitution , so tell me how ? 
  where art . 
  139 of constitution mensions something about sentence ? 
  it 's just the right of grace and it could be used in blanco , the same way president ford used it to pardon r. nixon . 
  how pardoning kaminski was against constitution ? 
  before answering i suggest you reading art . 
  139 of it . 
   refusing to swear in legally elected ct judges  swearing in illegally elected ct judges as far as i know , not all judges elected by previous government were elected with accordance to law . 
  they are also using slogans suggesting assasination ? 
  you mean wsi with it 's members working for soviet russia and using fundation pro civili to funnel out money ? 
  that was good decision .

  decided who 's going to rule in poland for 4 years . 
  i do n't support macieriewicz as head of mon , however i 'll make judgment about his cadency after it ends . 
  why are you so angry ? 
  calm down , it 's just internet forum with points . 
  and voters decided ... 
  it 's shame to use children to push their agenda . 
  i 'm sure , they even do n't know , what they are holding in their hands means . 
  [ `` free poland without the `` duck '' ( kaczy\u0144ski surname is similar to kaczka , which means duck in english ) '' ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_wkwbpqlalwh3haiuqjr6z9vwbdl7xos0.jpg ), 
  they are lunatics , that are fearmongering , because their party did n't won . 
  you sound like a lunatic . '', 
  i see pis everywhere , conspiracy everywhere '', 
  have you heard about fundation pro civili ? 
  because this unrest is created by media . 
  he might be arrested . 
  more news are coming out . 
  the newest one : the prosecutor initiated proceedings against k.dusza ( he was head of this facility ) . 
  i ca n't find any official answer from polish mon to quote at the moment , why they did that this way . 
  so i 'm bit shocked like everyone else . 
  i would like to have a source , which is n't biased aswell . 
  it was n't nato facility . 
   yeah , but how many of them perpetrates what amounts to an attack on a nato facility ? 
  they literally broke in using cloned keys in the middle of the night . 
  it was n't acredited by nato , so it was polish facility . 
   biggest pis propaganda ye , cool.gif i did n't know the site like strims.pl exist . 
  thanks, 
  other comment i red somewhere : `` nato did n't accredit this facility yet , so it 's matter of polish authorities '' . 
  do you have a source , which is n't anti-goverment ? 
  nato said `` this action is a matter of the polish authorities '' . 
  moreover , slovakia was informed week earlier , about change of the employees . 
  i know , its about this institution . 
  i can only link you sources , what this counterspionage might be ( not-officialy ) . 
  other source are polish media , dismissed plk . 
  k.dusza ( who run to tvn to complain ) and mon. 
  i just quoted something more interesting about whole incident . 
  i 'll translate one useful comment from polish `` reddit '' aka wykop . 
  everything is about slovak spy , who works there and plays for russians . 
  ( ... ) , because they ( * probably polish ministry of national defence * ) tried to block him and failed . 
  so macierewicz is cleaning counterspionage of nato from russian spies . 
  slovakia is prorussia for some time . 
  every unit from slovakia have to be observed more , and if needed , `` eliminated '' ( dismissal , deprivation of functions , etc. ), 
  unfortunately , no one writes about it , they only spit , that , again under cover of night `` they divide country and nato '' . 
  macierewicz is not fu ** ing around and made radical moves , because every day of presence of this spy , damage counterspionage of nato . 
  he has access to critical knowledge of nato . 
  polish mon informed slovak side , that they are going to change their personnel in counterspionage of nato week earlier , however people who were responsible for this , did n't do their work . 
  haha , soon in poland too . 
  because ? 
  it was sarcasm . 
  anyway , why you assume , making deficit = making sth better in the country ? 
  lol , every ruling gov. 
  increased state debt , dunno why so many people cry , because pis is doing that . 
  for me , making deficit in public finances should be banned . 
  ye , because only pis increased state debt . 
  what about visit of president duda in china ? 
  there were about 17-20k people . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wiegs/march_in_defence_of_democracy_livestream_from/cxwh0l0 this comment is less biased . 
   it 's not that simple . 
  term is 10 years which means that judges often overlap with next sejm or even second next . 
  so it is not like every gov select it 's own 15 judges . 
  also previous sejm delegated judges recommended by 3 parties . 
  everyother was elected by po goverment . 
  moreover in 2013 , this law has been changed , that only sejm can choose nominees . 
  3 parties : coalition po-psl and postcommunists from sld . 
  because every ruling government made institution of constitutional tribunal , the political tool . 
  it supposed to be an apolitical institution . 
  unfortunately it is n't . 
  i agree with kukiz '15 stance , that this constitution must be changed . 
  ** it favours political oligarchy ** . 
  just look who was nominated there during previous government ruling and their connections . 
  i do n't flatter law and justice party for what they are doing , because they are using ct as political tool also . 
  however , they have to , because in the future , the civic platform constitutional tribunal will impeach every law , not because to defend people from politicians , but to disturb current government , just because they can . 
  `` anti-corruption zealots '' dunno why they link that to bad qualities ... 
  lol, 
  its called in poland , the sienkiewicz trilogy . 
  the 1st one : [ with fire and sword . 
  ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12483314-with-fire-and-sword ) 2nd : [ the deluge . 
  ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25043522-the-deluge-vol-i-of-2-an-historical-novel-of-poland-sweden-and-ru ) 3rd : [ sir michael . 
  ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13006605-pan-michael ) also there are movies about every book in series . 
  e.g [ with fire and sword ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128378/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ), 
  there were n't any incidents you mentioned this year , moreover much more people came this year ( almost 100k ) . 
  and no , it 's not a shame to have an event like this . 
  your beliefs are minority in poland . 
  they called it , because of wiretapping scandal . 
  oh wait we had few wiretapping scandals while civic platform was rulling party .
