  does n't mean that his death did n't directly influence poles . 
  you cry over every step the refugees have to take in this sub , which is understandable from an emotional perspective - but when you then dismiss a soldier 's death as `` just some random pole '' it clearly shows that you care fuck all about your supposed moral values and just abuse the words for leverage . 
  despicable . 
  `` one random soldier '' ?!, 
  do you even notice what you sound like ?!, 
  lives sure are expendable to you once they do n't fit your world view .

  ... damn , i could have _ sworn _ that it said `` leftist paper '' when i submitted my comment , now it says `` liberal paper '' . 
  i remember being slightly put aback because heute does n't usually call things `` links '' that bluntly . 
  unfortunately , the wayback machine does n't seem to have archived the page . 
  ( are there other , similar crawlers ? ), 
  but they do n't really _ quote _ gw , they just use their title as an introduction to their own take . 
  as i said in a parallel comment , i consider that manipulative . 
  obama , putin and merkel take a break from a conference and decide to take a cruise in the north sea . 
  on board , since they ca n't stop with the politics , an argument about each nation 's submarine force develops . 
  obama opens with the loudmouth claim that `` nothing can beat our nuclear submarines !, 
  we 're undetectable , have be swarming the north sea for decades - after all , we can stay underwater for two weeks at a time ! '', 
  putin counters , `` decadent americans !, 
  if you would n't provide five-star cabins for your crew , you might well extend your forces to soviet levels of might - after all , little as you know , our missile crisis subs are still swarming florida ! '', 
  merkel is a bit embarrassed about the state of her military , but nonetheless decides to remedy the situations , opens her mouth and -- the sea swirls , an object covered in algae and mussels emerges , a hatch opens and a voice yells out : `` sieg heil , we need diesel ! '', 
  edit : and i was actually looking for another joke , but ca n't help to share a french-related one that was new to new as well - you heard that nike just became the official sponsor of the french army ? 
  unsurprising , seeing how they 're the biggest wartime customer for running shoes . 
  yeah , sorry , see my edit - i somehow did n't register `` americans '' . 
  there 's a reason we describe our climate as `` moderate '' - it 's the world standard for `` hospitable '' . 
  i 'm sure that if you had taken the same kind of statistics in 1000 a.d. \\* , people from northern scandinavia or sicily would have scored lower than those in temperate central europe as well because they would n't have had as large a variety of food , i. e. less nutrients , and general hardship on top of that . 
  introducing iodine into the food supply to prevent cretinism , for example , was a major undertaking in europe , and other deficiencies can result in neurological deficits as well . 
  that is certainly going to influence the stats . 
  ( \\* disregard the climate changes , you know what i mean . ), 
  edit : ah crap , i blanked on `` americans '' , i tend to ignore pc crap , sorry ... in that case , at least from what i infer from what i read about the us , poor nutrition is _ certainly _ to blame as well . 
  they seem to have completely lost any natural sense of what 's edible over there , to put it as a platitude . 
  it appears that poor black kids live in areas where there is actually no fresh produce available and people sustain themselves on fast food - it may seem unbelievable , but i 've been told so numerous times . 
  _ of course _ you ca n't grow up healthy like that . 
  iq is _ heavily _ influenced by childhood nutrition and so forth . 
  it 's not exactly surprising that people in a hostile environment wo n't turn out as smart . 
  you 'd need control data where one group was raised according to native standards and one with perfect nutrition and a fostering environment , then you could plausibly make the claim that this has manifested in their genes over time . 
  it 's afaik in fact true that the african iq is lower on average compared to highly developed areas , but you just _ assume _ the reason , you do n't attempt to validate it scientifically . 
  it 's more the presentation than the topics themselves . 
  if your lead picture is one of people protesting for accepting refugees and the first word is `` shame !, 
  '' , that simply sets the tone for the entire article . 
  everything beyond that is going to be read in relation to it because you already provoked a strong feeling in the reader , even if it 's a feeling of weariness of populism . 
  not to claim any authority here , but as a journalist myself ( outside politics ) i am quite sensitive to manipulative speech - especially if it 's as amateurishly blunt as in this case . 
  i did n't count spiegel as `` top-tier respectable '' , they 're a shadow of their former selves . 
   thousands bid welcome to the refugees in hamburg , kopenhagen , london and warschau . 
  but racists and populists array their lines in europe 's cities as well . 
  this kind of reporting demonstrates quite well why people think so . 
  this blatant doom-and-gloom contrast simply is n't worthy of a serious journalist , even the sz is _ far _ more subtle in stating their bias . 
  and zeit and faz have had numerous thoughtful articles devoid of such propaganda ( though the former , in line with their plurality approach , had thoughtless ones as well ) , which is why i said it 's surprising that sz with an outspoken bias is the only one of the holy trinity to report the protests . 
  ( faz , of course , has an unquestionable moderate conservative bias - basically the mirror image of the sz - , but a critical view is the most a conservative paper can afford without being labeled trash today . 
  so that 's at least one positive aspect of the modern approach to leitkultur . ), 
  come on , re-read my comment - southern germans and palatians are usually the only ones who _ are n't _ regarded as humorless . 
  do n't destroy that image , it 's highly fragile !, 
  interesting , our state media reports the _ exact _ opposite . 
  http://www.heute.de/warschaus-fluechtlingspolitik-gefaellt-vielen-polen-nicht-40062118.html `` solidarno\u015b\u0107 - a word of foreign concept in warschau '' complete with `` refugees welcome '' protest picture . 
  surprisingly , [ sz ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/fluechtlinge-tausende-osteuropaeer-demonstrieren-gegen-fluechtlinge-1.2645351 ) seems to be the only respectable ( ok , top-tier respectable ) news source reporting the protests , though of course not entirely unbiased . 
  many people today are . 
  and i 'm just describing how they act - especially the greens here try to claim they stand for liberty , and your average teenage `` leftist '' does as well . 
  that hippie mindset is what i was referring to , not the us definition . 
  eh , any kind of zealot is going to be a bitter creature in some way . 
  not exactly surprising that they would try to prevent others from [ edit : not , goddammit ] becoming bitter . 
  some things are not to be joked about . 
   has the catholic church come around to accepting that the earth is not flat yet ? 
  if you 're not being surreal on purpose , you should _ really _ stop lecturing people on the history of science . 
  congratulations , you made it exactly 3:09 hours !, 
  can you beat your record next time ? 
  oh this is cute , cutting directly to the chase this time are we ? 
  because it shows nicely how ... different kind of people handle others ' opinions . 
  it 's beautiful that you comment currently sits directly under slyratchet 's one . 
  makes the contrast even starker . 
   starting with shitloads of ambulances and police . 
  that 's not an _ individual _ need , though - you can provide it in a centralized way because it 's situational . 
  you can not provide the services a refugee might need in the same way if you house them in a decentralized way . 
  refugees have _ vastly _ different needs than a drunk tourist , come on ... the latter needs a bed and an aspirin , the former social workers , psychologists , clerics , and of course to actually be recognized as refugees _ a lot _ of bureaucrats . 
  _ that 's _ the limit , not `` empty space '' . 
  ( and even that is lacking because there are rules and regulations to follow when setting up a refugee shelter . ), 
  no , it 's 800k _ people _ that were predicted , the applications may happen in 2016 due to administrative delay in settling them . 
  and they 're not confused , people here were _ constantly _ ranting about the `` 800k lie '' until that difference was cleared up . 
  and the 200k number that was thrown around was the number of applications that had already happened until the end of july , which is of course significantly lower . 
  most people think that christianity caused some kind of `` dark age '' , but that 's far from the truth . 
  cases like galileo were more political than anything . 
  that the us protestants are nuts does n't exactly help the case , but a jesuit chemist philosopher is pope right now ... 
   in germany the process takes ~ 8 months 5.3 on average . 
  and that 's with the system still being clogged by balkan immigrants and should go down with the new fast-track procedures . 
  / r/europe was never liberal in the classic sense , though . 
  more that left/green brand that tends to think it 's liberal . 
  people are usually talking about private channels when they say that . 
  but has phoenix stopped doing those sensationalist acted documentaries ? 
  i stopped watching them long ago because it became too much . 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  they 're debating the scorched earth policy , it 's from the movie downfall . 
  ( very reccommendable , btw . ), 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/hatcovetingputin last post 8 months ago , it unfortunately does n't look like it . 
  ... no it 's not . 
  https://www.google.de/search?q=%22import+von+arbeitskr%c3%a4ften%22  `` import von arbeitskr\u00e4ften ''  10.900 results if your outrage sensors trigger on such a common phrase , it 's not exactly surprising you have a pretty one-sided view of this debate ... 
  interesting . 
  people here just do an apprenticeship , then go to meisterschule ( master school ) if they 're good enough and want to run their own business . 
  oh ffs , do n't act like this is the first time you 've ever seen the csu mentioned outside bavaria ... the reactions are always the same hyperbolic clich\u00e9s . 
  this thread . 
  `` right-wing '' or `` xenophobic '' are synonymous with `` insane '' here . 
  that means nothing , most germans see the csu as insane - does n't really matter how much it has to do with reality , they have zero influence outside bavaria . 
  they can say whatever they want , otherwise seehofer would n't lead the party .
