  it does n't take an extreme view to group large parts of the population of any country as idiots . 
  i congratulate anyone who kicks your collective kaases , and i 'm sure i have the support of about 80 million in doing so . 
  hup island hup !, 
  it refers to our current problems with not being effective enough at deporting people . 
  it 's a diplomatic way to say that authorities will have to be stricter about that in the future . 
  just as cherry-picked and ideologically driven as the post they responded to , though . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right - neither of these posts helps someone with arriving at a sane opinion . 
  ah yes , the famed literal _ millions _ of nazis in germany are of course to blame here ... 
  that would be the biggest downside ... it 's already too hot and wet in germany and i 'm supposed to consider africa 's abominable conditions `` nice weather '' ? 
  rough translation :  `` what we are seeing now is something that will keep our country engaged in the coming years already , something that will change it and that we want to make into a positive influence - and we believe we will be able to do so . 
  '' , merkel said monday morning in the chancellor 's office . 
  so it 's _ far _ less dramatic than the bbc makes it out to be - `` occupy '' is a valid literal translation but an entirely inappropriate one in this context . 
  i 'm honestly getting fed up with the bullshit propaganda by all kinds of self-styled trustworthy media - all sides of this debate seem to have decided that lying to the peoples is the only way forward . 
  shameful , really - we need _ less _ emotion , not more manipulation . 
  it 's infuriating that it 's usually not even tangible enough to expose without sounding like a loon . 
   but i love this country ,  to me , she has no sins  if you do n't buy my record  then al qaeda wins !, 
  there 's a reason why you even parody yourself like that . 
  i do n't know how widespread that sentiment is , but there are a significant number of vocal poles and czechs who get very angry at being called `` eastern europe '' . 
  it could be interpreted to mean either thing , which is even worse than defining it clearly the way you interpret it . 
  seeing how being in hungary is apparently worse than dying in syria , i imagine they 'd be inclined to do so . 
  now you 're just listing buzzwords that have become completely meaningless thanks to people like you ... 
   and another use of paprika spray how very hungarian . 
  jesus fucking christ , could you _ please _ stop using that word ?!, 
  not even the most insanely deluded nutjob could possibly consider this appropriate !, 
  wow , a pole responding to someone talking about eastern europe ? 
  now i 've seen everything . 
   so you 're just labeling an entire country . 
  that 's rich , considering that you did the exact same ... and on much flimsier ground . 
  _ at least _ one third . 
  jobbik is somewhat similar to greece 's golden dawn , which i suppose you know . 
  complete with party uniforms and goosestep marches . 
  it 's what we do in modern europe . 
  jokingly insulting each other as frogmen / nazis / beggars / thieves / whatever is very much preferable over shooting each other . 
  no idea , sorry , i 'm not on facebook and my friends are unlikely to buy into simplistic bullshit like that . 
  according to my perception , such avenues are n't commonly exploited in germany , though - concentrating on cultural disparity is far less controversial , considering our history . 
  i mentioned papers because they discriminate _ far _ less than parties . 
  parties are even less likely to mention socially unacceptable news if they are n't socially unacceptable themselves . 
  for all intents and purposes , the union is the only right-wing party we have ( however minimally they are right-of-center today ) , npd and the like are just fringe parties mentioned as `` also-rans '' . 
  the way i perceive him , he probably kept his image in mind until his last breath . 
  you can definitely make a decent opposing argument , though . 
   a 14 year old boy gets put on the sexual offenders register for a girl saving his nude snapcat selfie and distributing it amongst her friends . 
  wtf , i thought muricans were the only people insane enough for that to happen ... 
  and hitler used the christian faith to manipulate people but can hardly be called a christian . 
  dictators use whatever increases their power , regardless of their personal opinion . 
  saddam was well known for eschewing religious conflicts , he only used them when it was suitable to do so . 
  that 's not how the german media works at all , not even the basest papers would use such an `` argument '' . 
  she 's only the 3rd most popular politician in germany , but steinmeier and schaeuble arguably represent very similar approaches and could n't withstand the pressure of the office while keeping their popularity in the court of public opinion . 
  it 's more complex than you claim . 
  there 's a huge variety of stances between helping people and letting them die , and few of them are represented by the apparent naivety that currently dominates the debate . 
  the government enforces such naive approaches and there _ must _ be a number of people who oppose that concept . 
  there 's _ always _ a need to insult the frogmen . 
   plus on top of that i have yet to meet any person in the uk who actually believes in any eu ideal , it is seen as more of a economical thing . 
  the idea of it being a peace project and all that just does n't exist in the uk . 
  really ?!, 
  you can oppose the eu 's policies and their implementation with very reasonable arguments , but it 's pretty much unquestionable that it has brought the countries closer together and eliminated many a reason for war . 
  it 's not just coincidental that we stopped killing each other after ww2 when we had been doing that since the beginning of time . 
  amen . 
  germany really is trapped , for both international and domestic reasons . 
  representing my flair , i of course have to mention our [ lumpenkapellen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl8auqnynzq ) - they 're very common at swabian festivities and usually get the mood to a boiling point . 
  generally speaking , though , it 's unfortunate that many people seem to think our history and traditions begin and end with the 3rd reich . 
  oh yeah , if you include marches there are of course _ many _ awesome works missing . 
  i was only talking about lieder . 
  i primarily focused on the romantic period since that 's when most of our actual folk songs were were written . 
  if you include schlager ( 20th century `` folk songs '' ) , there are of course many , many ones that had had a large amount of influence as well . 
  [ hundert mann und ein befehl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klqg-mv9hfg ) - `` a hundred men and one command '' - would be a great example as well , an anti-war song about the plight of an individual soldier . 
  that one will primarily be known among soldiers . 
  other songs might be more popular for historical reasons or because they 're popular among children or during carneval . 
  for context , lieber augustin is a common german song that basically makes fun of a hypothetical joker who lost his fortune . 
  `` augustin '' is pretty much synonymous to `` joker '' in germany , and `` alles ist hin '' means `` you lost everything '' . 
  none that i 'm aware of . 
  i have a very limited understanding of neurochemistry , but my impression is that the working principles of opioids and opiates are _ far _ better understood than that of stimulants . 
  that 's likely because there are specific opioid receptors in the brain , unlike stimulants which have a more complex neurochemical effect across a multitude of transmitter systems . 
  ( that 's not to say that opiates and opioids do n't do the same , of course , but the effects of withdrawal or intoxication may be addressed more directly if you know their `` primary target '' . ), 
  but summarily speaking , we know fuck all about the human brain - we have some very crude models that may help from case to case , but the whole thing is _ far _ too complex for us to understand right now . 
  so all we can do is throwing nukes at some areas and hope it helps . 
  that 's even more evident in psychiatric therapy - we have few ideas how to _ really _ treat endogenous malfunctions so psychotherapy remains the more effective approach . 
  damn , that 's one of the funniest videos i 've seen in a long time . 
  thanks . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  last time that topic came up someone linked different stats that painted a very different picture , but that of course does n't mean much . 
  obligatory : [ fest steht und treu die wacht am rhein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml2sviclu4a ) one of the best patriotic / war songs there are , imho . 
  germany has an awesome song tradition that 's unfortunately largely forgotten today . 
  there used to be a universal german songbook , the kommersbuch , which primarily contained songs from the romantic period and was used by just about any kind of association . 
  today , it 's only being used by fraternities and i _ think _ freemasons , also the baltic states appear to keep ( a bit of a funny version of ) that culture alive . 
  my personal favorite is [ der sang ist verschollen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvp0v9ishra ) , the story of a traveling scholar realizing how far removed from the world he is . 
  unfortunately there 's no good complete version to be found online . 
  other ones i like : - [ die gedanken sind frei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhdy0y8aqpm ) - `` the thoughts are free '' , about freedom of thought in times of oppression - [ gl\u00fcck auf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fknl6etjuxg&amp;index=7&amp;list=pl3c3ef0721c237b28 ) - about germany 's miners - [ als die roemer frech geworden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyrwwey5qva ) - ridicules the failure of the first roman invasion of germany - [ gaudeamus igitur ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ziypt37xli&amp;index=8&amp;list=pl3c3ef0721c237b28 ) - pretty international , i think , but has a particularly strong tradition here - [ gold und silber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmfemosh5ng&amp;index=14&amp;list=pla56fbb9c2b48995c ) - about the value of metaphorical gold and silver , like golden curls and silver wine - [ wildgaense rauschen durch die nacht ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbt5uue-9hu&amp;index=18&amp;list=pla56fbb9c2b48995c ) - my old company song , sniff . 
  about soldiers in wwi - [ wenn alle untreu werden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc7ncrp9x0e ) - `` if all became unfaithful '' , about the german quest for unity - [ vom hohen olymp herab ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90t-k0fyuq4 ) - about the shortness of life , sung in memory of lost friends - [ nicht der pflicht nur zu gen\u00fcgen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itmtms8p7pc ) - about the youthful drive to achieve something extraordinary i also like `` ergo bibamus '' and `` drei klaenge sind 's '' very well but could n't find a half-decent representation of those . 
  as i said , the fraternities are the only ones to keep the tradition alive publicly , so those are all fraternity versions , though they lack much of the passion they 'd usually be sung with and many of the recordings are pretty bad . 
  [ max raabe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afjsf_uv5i0 ) is one of the few who keeps that tradition alive , by the way , with a mix of 20s-50s germany and french chanson . 
  ps : and since most germans will probably be inclined to call me a nazi because i even dared mention fraternities , you have no goddamn clue about that scene 's reality and bought into ridiculously absurd propaganda . 
  sorry for being crass , but i 'm not interested in debating `` opinions '' that got my friends into the hospital or on the edge of their grave . 
  edit : oh , and i realize the ones without translations will probably not mean much to a foreigner . 
  if someone 's interested , i can probably did up translations or make a crude one myself . 
   people who do it once are addicted forever that 's absolute nonsense . 
  it 's just a very strong stimulant , no more no less . 
  half the world gave it to pilots and tank crews in ww2 . 
  that list is completely useless . 
  they list five ( ! ), 
  different regions with a separatist movement for germany - of which not even the bavarians ' is much more than a joke .
