  but i just assumed they were another group of people since most are from istanbul and were n't too fond of the rural regions , either . 
   second thing i want to say is turks do n't wear burqas . 
  yup , that 's why i differentiated between turkish women and burqa wearers . 
  sorry that was n't more clear . 
  so more generally put - any experience with something foreign can reinforce a feeling of `` this place is becoming foreign '' to some degree . 
  and while it takes strong experiences ( or a certain upbringing ) to generate it in the first place , as the feeling grows lesser and lesser experiences serve to make it stronger . 
  and the crux is that small counter-examples ( if they are even noticed due to blending in ) do n't lessen it much . 
  after all , not every german someone meets makes them think `` this is home '' , either - it 's just neutral . 
  but that 's becoming way too abstract by now ... all i wanted to do is attempt to explain some of the factors at play regarding the native germans ' stats , not make an all-encompassing model for understanding feelings towards immigrants . 
  of course there are many , many more processes involved , but i clearly said that initially . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ welt ^ ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ ^ better . 
  alright then . 
  i just despise the local - it gets quoted everywhere for foreign news , but is usually absolute yellow press level shit concerning the depth of the articles and the level of apparent understanding of the issues . 
  well , we 're not exactly talking about getting into african panties here . 
  there 's useful labeling and there 's mindless labeling , you seem to confuse just labeling with the latter . 
  problems only arise if you use labels out of context , just like it would make no sense to `` call you out '' for being a `` casanova '' here . 
  yeah , locally of course , but i 'd be surprised if they were commonly known of in the rest of germany and outside history books . 
  the pm 's ethnicity is n't going to come up very much . 
  oh fuck off , i want to associate with both of your idiotic factions equally little . 
  all you 're doing is digging trenches . 
  the [ sorbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbs ) , i would think . 
  pretty much nothing is known about them , most people do n't even know they exist . 
  the `` true '' frisians might be another candidate , they 're said to be hardy , silent and drink a lot of grog . 
  ( assuming you 're talking about indigenous minorities . ), 
  germany is pretty much defined by its states and people will usually just call themselves bavarian or saxonian . 
  ts ; dr : i would n't trust the local on _ anything _ . 
  this is posted by moderatorsofeurope ** 2 ** , not moderatorsofeurope . 
  it 's not like all bavarians speak with deep dialect . 
  i 've lived near the austrian border all my life and you barely hear where i 'm from . 
  ideal ones do , real ones do n't . 
  so such interviews may well exist . 
  and regardless , with some slight rephrasing even ideal journalists could ask such questions . 
  depends on what aspect you look at . 
  that many , many young turks feel like they have lost the roots and orientation a home culture would give them is true afaik , it 's been reported numerous times in respected media . 
  that does n't automatically mean they 'll become extremists , just that they 're more likely to act out in some way - which _ can _ include religious extremism . 
  i think it 's the ambivalence in perception - most likely , when germans say they feel threatened , they 're thinking of isis and mass immigration , not the d\u00f6nermann around the corner . 
  but since something like that ca n't really be quantified , it 's not reflected in studies and thus the news , which may make people who watch those news feel threatened . 
  that 's just an example off the top of my head , i 'm sure there are many such ambivalences . 
  i 'm not claiming that 's all that is to the phenomenon , but i think it 's a substantial part of it . 
  and the ` not feeling at home ' part : well , it _ is _ a different culture and partly religion . 
  i once worked for a very industrious turkish immigrant who invited me home once - and made his wife and daughters stay in the bedroom as long as i was there , i did n't even catch a glimpse of them . 
  i had highly respected him before for his work spirit ; after , ... not so much . 
  things like that do give me a very uneasy feeling of `` not being at home '' , and most people will probably have several such impressive experiences in their lifetime which may shape their perception . 
  and a turkish woman will often look pretty much german so she does n't stick out , but the women walking through the streets in full burqas do . 
  that is another , less obvious factor and one that ca n't be averted except by thinking `` they may be a secret immigrant '' when looking at someone or asking everybody . 
  things like the last two are even less possible to quantify , reinforcing the first paragraph . 
  ( edit : and the more subtle experiences like burqas , of course , reinforce the more impressive ones . ), 
  edit : / u/benthetraveler , at least use an alt for downvoting my comment history ... you do know it 's entirely transparent that you ca n't downvote a comment twice , so that during your second run the ones from the first ( which were in the middle of the second and which you responded to and immediately downvoted ! ), 
  were untouched , and the third run goes up to the point of _ exactly _ the second run ? 
  and it 's quite unlikely that such various comments would _ all _ randomly go down one point , even in deleted threads . 
  ffs , you may be politically insane , do n't behave like a petulant child ... 
  the japanese look nothing like the spanish . 
  and the former comply much more to old central european aristocratic beauty ideals , which is why they 're highly rated in the west . 
  same for slavs , to an extent . 
   write mkdir into bash ? 
  to easy to make mistakes . 
  that 's why there 's completion and tools like [ fuck ] ( https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck ) . 
  if it 's similar to the one on linux , it simply likes letting temporary files lie around . 
  very important to know if you do n't like people snooping on what archives you extract . 
  as if anything could sooth the russian soul - one of beaten children . 
  edit : tsk , tsk , tsk ... a russia appreciation thread where people do n't understand this post ? 
  you 're all sure you 're not just paying lip service ? 
  you had to make a new account because the old one got downvoted too much to be able to post any more ? 
  that 's hilarious . 
  at the _ very least _ it made them more aggressive by not using throwaways any more . 
  i have all users of all racist subs on reddit res tagged , and they 're absolutely everywhere now , not just in the megathread . 
  they are bigger than most subs on reddit , period . 
  the majority of reddit traffic obviously goes to some very few defaults because that 's where people without an account go , that 's why i said `` most '' ... 
  oh that 's cute , a new tactic . 
  calling me a racist is vague enough to be supported by salami tactics , but show me one single post i _ ever _ made there or where i _ ever _ supported them . 
  feel free to peruse my entire posting history and dig up any single speck of dirt you can find about me , it 'll be fun . 
  ( and no , nice try , saying `` they 're big '' is n't `` supporting them '' . ), 
  was n't that a rather big topic in poland ? 
  i remember hearing about it at least . 
  it 's still sorted by ` new ' . 
  maybe you have suggested sorting turned off or it saved your preference from somewhere else , reddit likes to do that in general . 
  oh god damn it , you 'd think i could recognize a troll after 20 years on the net ... but look at the rest of this thread , you 're everything but the most extreme , and with some people like / u/benthetraveler or / u/maxi _ w i 'm definitely sure they 're serious . 
  edit : never got anyone to downvote my comment history before . 
  mushrooms and roguelikes sure are racist . 
  it 's so funny you folks consider yourself the reasonable ones . 
  the daily mail _ should _ be banned - not for being right-wing but for simply being trash . 
  same with all other yellow press , tearjerking nonsense , `` human interest '' stories etc , they do nothing than make people stupider . 
  force a new yorker subscription on everyone on the planet . 
  you do know that trp and mensrights are _ way _ bigger and more active than most subs on reddit , right ? 
  including _ all _ of the `` social justice '' oriented ones . 
  by your metric , everyone outside / r/fatpeoplehate could have been `` forced out '' . 
  the megathread has _ prompted _ an absolutely massive brigade . 
  a single data point ( though i agree there are a multitude now , thanks to the megathread ) does n't constitute a general rule , though . 
  i was just about to say `` saying they can go somewhere else is n't an argument because it applies to everyone '' . 
  little did i know that was your actual suggestion . 
  no , not when i state my future behavior - it 's not relevant if i _ had _ insulted you before that . 
  the message was that i had come to the conclusion you were n't even worth insulting . 
  there only one tool in your arsenal , is there ? 
  and it 's not very sharp . 
   even for right-wing tards , this is a new low in constistent arguing . 
  heh , right . 
  the actual insult was from the first post , and insulting your tactics is n't insulting _ you _ . 
   see , this is called logical and rational thinking , by the way , something rarely understood by your ilk . 
  `` my ilk '' , i. e. people who actually look at their posting history before claiming what it contains ? 
  and that 's illogical and irrational ?
