  those focused alts could just as well be from people who do n't want the topic to spoil their main posting history ; i have several such alts for different topics myself , which would look like what you describe and i 'm not affiliated with any extremist sub or scene .

  rather a lot of economics . 
  that claim is made in every post about the topic , and yet basically zero people here have a posting history in those subs . 
  unless you 've got a really good magic crystal ball , you 're really just basing this on conjecture and guesses and opinion , not facts . 
  so do n't claim it as a fact . 
   front page has been in no way drown in imigration posts , what a bullshit argument . 
  hey , they were able to find the terrifying number of six submissions when cleaning up ... 
   you 're a fucking racist and part of the problem . 
  that one does n't work in europe as well as you think it does ... 
  first twice as many , then none . 
  alcohol consumption per capita . 
  when someone turns 40 here , they 're finally considered an adult ; `` ab heit wirsch gescheit '' , `` starting today you are intelligent '' is the common term and the celebration reflects that . 
  maybe , but that would be german levels of dedicating yourself to a feud . 
  i mean , all that time without even shitting on his doorstep !, 
  you should not have come here without being able to appreciate t\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6ring\u00c4n !, 
  i ca n't help for sweden , but thelocal gets used for german news very commonly as well , and zeit or deutsche welle are far better sources here . 
  it would be very surprising to me if something like them did n't exist in sweden , particularly because the zeit has a section where they share articles from the nyt ( i think ? ), 
  and iirc le monde has something similar . 
  those are genuine mental disorders , afaik , to [ can the jokes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artist%27s_shit ) for a moment . 
  i 've known two such individuals - someone at my second-tier school and someone at a music festival - , and they had actual compulsions to spread their waste in public . 
  obviously , details were never made public , but afaik they actually suffered from it . 
  `` crap , what were we so anxious about ? 
  we _ really _ planned to report on this steaming heap for four months ?!, 
  journalism 's goin ' down the shitter , i tell you . '', 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxh_s4eidzi ), 
  well , i 'm old enough to remember when emigrants went to interesting places . 
  like russia , or later argentina . 
  does every russian immigrant get a rifle and a helmet at the border or is that just for tourists ? 
  i do n't think i would describe it as depressing ; it 's , say , arid ? 
  it 's basically impossible to have a passionate debate in politics here , and i for one think that 's a good thing ; others may disagree . 
  furthermore , the climate does n't lend itself to truly novel ideas or experiments , which is probably ... less good . 
  however , it is _ very _ conductive to realpolitik , something that has been successful in germany since the war ; we 're obviously flourishing , maybe with a lack of new ideas but sustainable . 
  there was a brief time when ideological tensions flared up again ( around stuttgart 21 ) , but the final polls showed that most people did n't want that so we just went back to having very , very boring , methodical , analytic and productive politics . 
  not much to look at , but i like it . 
   my point is that you 're not going to be able to tell if someone is a convert to islam unless they tell you well , reacting to appearance is the only case where your assertion is n't true , making this argument a bit pointless . 
  and i 'm not sure on muslims ' precise guidelines for appearance , but i do n't know if they could completely avoid `` detection '' if they just wanted to . 
  particularly because ( afaik ) there are different rules for people under duress , which would of course be a matter of definition . 
  as an ordinary convert , probably ; a zealot will quickly end up looking the part , though , wearing beard and kaftan and takke . 
  things _ definitely _ have changed a lot in 15 years , the bipartisan efforts of schroeder and merkel 's grand coalitions had an enormous influence on german politics with their borderline autocracy and were very much reflected in media . 
  that does n't mean that there is no debate any more , but `` basta ! '', 
  and `` altnernativlos '' are their respective characteristic words , which speaks volumes . 
  it 's just that , as i said , the debate happens _ before _ legislation is even begun to be made , which has good and bad sides to it . 
   it 's relatively common in germany at the very least not at all , at least in my experience . 
  laws tend to be named very rarely in any kind of reputable media because they 're usually the end point of a debate and there is little to be reported beyond `` they wrote this now '' . 
  if anything but the actual name you might see a shorthand , but i 've _ never _ seen a law commonly tied to a person in name ( even association is rare ) , to stay with the case at hand . 
  apart from that , thank you for elaborating !, 
  not always , just for the last 40 years or so . 
  their post-war coverage up to and including the raf is actually great , they have their historic issues partly online . 
  really ? 
  the latter two are obvious , but i actually thought things like `` cassie 's law '' were semi-official . 
  good to know it 's just your media being even worse than i thought , then . 
   a quota of untermensch filthy niggers minorities who 100 % were forced to live there or else the evil leftists would come and deport the god-fearing , racially pure , non-multicultural white victims oh fuck off back to srs , your bullshit is n't appreciated elsewhere . 
  that or learn to at least present it like an adult . 
  you 're making my point for me . 
  `` how do you dare criticize the name , socrates died for this shit ! '', 
  it 's the less obvious equivalent of making a `` pedophiles suck '' law or a `` are you a murderer or what ?! '', 
  law . 
  oooh , so it 's a meta joke about the discrepancy between rhetoric and reality ? 
  that would actually make sense but be far too subtle for the medium . 
  `` not much luck '' ? 
  she 's strategically destroyed everyone who could come remotely close to her . 
  despite her bland demeanor , she 's one of the union 's most ruthless politicians . 
  \\  spd \\  left top kek knallt die bestie ab !, 
  i do n't think merkel has to purposely imitate kohl , she 's as close as a woman can be without having grown up in palatia . 
  edit :  germany has brought its past to the surface , endlessly discussed it , and accepted it , and this work of many years has freed the patient to lead a successful new life . 
  i really like this analogy . 
  like in psychoanalysis , the individual confessions are meaningless and often bullshit presented in an even more bullshittier way , but the process as a whole and most importantly the liberty not to care if you 're talking nonsense is important . 
   cassie 's law sometimes , i just want to yell at the anglo countries . 
  it 's like they 're trying to make themselves look like idiots deliberately . 
  `` well , he started it , mommy ! '', 
  `` the others '' behaving like children does n't mean that childlike behavior is in any way intellectual . 
  you really have to have a comically bad opinion of humanity if you think that obliterating all diversity is the best way to make people embrace `` multiculturalism '' . 
  the outrage !, 
  especially when you realize that this is pretty much the definition of `` a minority '' !, 
  not to mention that you 'd probably find it hard to find a `` christian area '' in stockholm . 
  this is n't ireland or the us . 
   according to the left , muslims are top and homosexuals are second . 
  well yeah , it 's only gay if you 're bottom . 
  so this rule makes both the left and the muslims happy . 
   islamophobia is typically going to be a reaction based on appearance . 
  it 's probably not going to be an issue for a white guy who is a convert to islam . 
  what the ... 
  what ?!, 
  white converts to islam are widely seen as being most in danger of falling to islamism . 
  somewhat , yes . 
  now see , _ that _ was sarcasm !, 
  you seem to have understood after all . 
  well , you should apologize for abusing words like that . 
  from `` kuruz turks '' , turk-affiliated mercenaries . 
  `` sarcasm '' means that you were deliberately being caustic and abusive . 
  so not only did you fuck up your post and your tag , but also your `` apology '' . 
  i wish that definition would finally get inside reddit 's collective meathead ... 
  yeah , point in case ... screaming `` raaaaaaacist '' in every imaginable context is eerily reminiscent of screaming '' [ jeeeeeeeeews ] ( http://denktag2004.denktag-archiv.de/homes/20/analyse2/bild1.jpg ) '' whenever possible , and regardless of it being socially acceptable it still makes you look like as much of a moron . 
  especially if you think it 's an actual argument instead of just trying to sway people who are as braindead as yourself . 
  that i had to check with an alt if you actually deleted this speaks volumes about both you as a mod and the reddit era of transparency .
