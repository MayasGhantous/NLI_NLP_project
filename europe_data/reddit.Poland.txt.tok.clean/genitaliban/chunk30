  the stats also do n't differentiate between crimes against people and crimes against houses , which i think is the most important difference of all . 
  many of the attacks on refugee homes occurred before people even lived there afaik . 
  ( of course destroying something that could be potentially a home for someone is still `` a crime against people '' in some sense , but there 's still an enormous difference . ), 
  i think sweden should take cover from imploding heads during the next week or so . 
   the vote buttons are not `` i agree/disagree '' buttons yeah , until about five minutes after the inception of reddit . 
   i find it incredibly funny that french mod guy just gets downvoted out of habit here on / r/europe now . 
  also that there 's a string of [ deleted ] comments following them everywhere . 
   it 's on that side deliberately . 
  it 's also very obviously misplaced if the title becomes [ controversial ] too long . 
  me three . 
  so are many other , more legitimate news sources . 
  you `` absolutely know '' ? 
  `` even if they do n't '' ? 
  right , right , that 's absolutely a solid basis for definitive claims !, 
  i can only repeat for the eleventeenth time today that i wonder where someone gets the arrogance to behave like that . 
  at least people on the opposite end of the spectrum are straight-forward and on the nose ; lies and deception of that particular kind seem to be a specialty of the left . 
  are you _ trying _ to insult my sense of logic , or are you _ honestly _ trying to claim that the isolated use of such a term on reddit is proof of ongoing large-scale involvement of another , specific site here !? 
  because that would be _ insane _ . 
   01-18-2014 right , one `` call for action '' is definitive proof of current large-scale involvement on reddit ? 
  do n't be purposely obtuse ... and `` you can be sure '' has n't exactly been the best of reasonings about , well , anything ever . 
  prove it . 
  fucking prove that reddit is seeing regular , large-scale brigades from stromfront for once , ffs !, 
  nobody has made that proof yet , but people proclaim it again and again and again !, 
  until that happens , i will consider the repeat claims of such brigades self-serving lies . 
  not sure , but it may come from german - `` kulturbereicherung '' is a standing term and one i could see the green party here use in earnest . 
  yeah , it 's impossible to `` just google '' context . 
  [ his face ] ( http://www.cicero.de/sites/default/files/field/image/steinbrueck_0.jpg ) does have an impressive frown carved into it , though , which says a lot about his character . 
  he 's not an unpopular politician , either , just known for having zero tolerance for populism or popularity , making him uniquely appealing across the political spectrum . 
  i was referring more to the attitude you display here - `` everybody 's mad ad us because everybody 's ignorant , it 's horrible ! '', 
  - than your actual situation irl . 
  i just _ intensely _ dislike such attempts to make `` the others '' appear illegitimate - it 's arrogant , disingenuous and counterproductive in _ any _ discussion , especially such a polarized one . 
  it 's not even that i think the cartoonist is _ wrong _ , i do n't even understand what they 're trying to _ say _ . 
  it just does n't seem to make sense - why are the countries beating _ themselves _ up if they 're competing against each other ? 
  i too can type uppercase letters to demonstratively imply that you are being a disingenuous asshole trying to represent your opponents as unintelligent loudmouths !, 
  ... oh wait , you 're the lying fucktard from the other thread , never mind . 
  do you actually have any tangible reason for any of your opinions or are they all just hazy ideology ? 
  no shit , sherlock , you asking me to prove a negative is something that agitates me even further than your lies ?!, 
  if you are actually being genuine , you 're exactly the kind of person i thought you to be as well . 
  your rectum being firmly fit around the ivory tower does n't mean that you 're representative of academia - quite the opposite , in fact . 
  only if you 're trying to make people more distrustful of immigration , equality , or _ anything _ `` progressive '' , you 're being very productive - that is what makes me so angry , that and that there are so many idiots like you who think their `` correct '' opinion gives them the license to lie and cheat and slander !, 
  yeah , _ sure _ i 'll prove that there 's no monster in your closet !, 
  what are you saing , it can render itself invisible ? 
  there is _ one _ screenshot of a stormfront thread from _ years ago _ that self-important lying fucktards like you have been using to claim boogeyman invasions ever since , and absolutely nothing else . 
  `` good luck '' with making normal people buy into your bullshit , i 'll instead trust cold hard facts derived from analyzing comment data . 
  that 's complete bullshit and to ridiculous a lie that i do n't know which aspect to question first . 
  almost nobody on this sub has a posting history in / r/european , and it 's impossible to know who uses an alt , so where are you getting the confidence to make such a statement from ?!, 
  do n't you realize that people like you are the main reason for your opponents to be able to gather public support ?!, 
  you ca n't lie to advance anything , ffs , especially not when your lies can easily be exposed - for instance by simply analyzing publicly available data like reddit comments !, 
  racism !, 
  racism everywhere !!!!, 
  those downvotes _ might _ just reflect the disdain people feel for your loudly proclaimed martyrdom instead of `` racism !!!!!!!, 
  wow , living evidence of the horseshoe theory !, 
  that 's rare !, 
  sorry , but i 'm not going to retrace my steps of a whole day 's worth of browsing just to point out how shitty your dismissive sarcasm looks to me . 
  click through the comment threads yourself and update your post with a ` mea culpa ' when you 're done . 
  _ nothing _ makes shit like that appropriate . 
  so , for reference : i traveled scandinavia in 2006 , and slept on the malm\u00f6 beach near the city when arriving there because there is almost zero danger of anything bad happening in germany and i assumed scandinavia was the same . 
  news like this has me thinking that would be a bad idea today - is that true ? 
   the number of explosions is falling this reads like a joke . 
  or africa . 
   malm\u00f6 is a very mixed city , so any organized crime gang is going to be mixed so even your criminals are politically correct and colorblind ? 
  because that sure as hell is n't a valid conclusion elsewhere . 
  that is , after all , the only reason for anyone to be interested in the news , politics or societal trends . 
  fucking brown people . 
  hence why the explosive is surrounded by things that become sharp metal flying bits . 
  you do n't need much force at all for that concept to become very dangerous . 
  thelocal is entirely and utterly shit in any of its iterations . 
  about as in-depth as the daily mail , just without the bias . 
  i have no idea why it gets so much exposure on this sub . 
  http://www.taglog.ml/commentlog/?user=cresscrowbits bullshit . 
  you do know that they probably did n't compile this by hand , right ? 
  without exaggerating , i 've at least read about it 20 times on / r/europe today . 
  each time accompanied by the claim that you 'll never read about it on / r/europe , and how this is obvious evidence of racism . 
  maybe that kind of idiocy is part of the reason for things like this not getting much exposure - i would n't want to put myself in such company . 
  they had about a 90 % overlap with the rpg scene where i grew up . 
  it ca n't all be handguns and whores , they have to do something in their free time as well . 
  steinbrueck is basically the most technocratic of the realpolitiker and known for being comically serious , which is probably something you have to know to properly assess that statement . 
  it 's incredibly out of character for him . 
  germany is already `` full '' in the sense that producers of container homes ca n't keep up with the demand to build new refugee housing . 
  regardless of politics , there simply _ is _ a limit to how many refugees a country can take , and we 're currently running into it at full speed without a helmet . 
  good thing reddit is n't a university , then . 
  your downvotes come from repeating the same paranoid crap at least thrice , not from a tiny sub with a fraction of / r/europe 's userbase . 
  your behavior screams `` but i 'm so used to being paraded as one of the good guys !, 
  not only housing , which can mean something like a siedlung , but heime , i. e. single buildings with many independent parties . 
  things like that are quite common . 
  for instance , far right crime statistics are so enormously dominant over the far left because every swastika scrawled in public gets counted as a crime ( instead of a misdemeanor ) and the left does n't have an equivalent for that . 
  you have pre-defined coalitions ? 
  that seems like an awful idea , especially if there are parties outside of them . 
  ( meaning that not only you [ edit : have the potential for getting ] partisan crap like the us does but also extremist kingmakers . 
  worst of both worlds , yay ! ), 
  taste and texture are bad ? 
  i find them similar to mussels , which i love as well . 
  a good bit more ... unique , maybe , but not unpleasantly so . 
  but i know what you mean with `` us way of eating '' ... abhorrently uncivilized , that . 
  why the rarity of eating snails ? 
  if they were commonly available here , i 'd be eating them much more often . 
  friends of mine even do occasional gourmand tours of france in part due to the availability of snails and frog legs . 
  oh jesus christ , you 're really reaching here ... it was _ me _ who made the joke about `` jewishly smirking '' , not the zeit . 
  yeah , i did an interrail tour of scandinavia in late summer and they were my main worry ; there was some strange cutoff near the beginning of my journey where they posed zero problems . 
  plus september is probably the most beautiful time to go hiking in the countryside .
