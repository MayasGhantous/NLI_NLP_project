  yes , yes , hurr durr offensive ... talk to somebody who cares . 
  it 's how comically exaggerated shekel-coveting jews are depicted all over , and only the perpetually offended will make a serious case out of it . 
   also i did n't know there was a `` jewish '' smirk . 
  never been to 4chan ? 
  how does one manage to be in ( not to mention survive ) four accidents ?!, 
  i 've witnessed one light bump here , and i 'm a horrible driver . 
  have you ever been there ? 
  most of finland is very habitable if you discount mosquitoes , it 's just a giant forest that nobody has bothered to clear yet . 
  all of europe looked like that at one point not too long ago . 
  that 's how it 's in the best of cases worldwide , though , and entirely human . 
  of course people will try to get those they know and trust ahead , and i see nothing wrong with that - after all , people in any kind of well-rounded power ( i. e. not the flimsy kind supported by populism etc. ), 
  are likely to be there because they 're smarter and have better practical judgment than others . 
  of course that system does n't favor philosophers and the like , but plato 's philosopher kings were never that realistic a concept for millennia ; and the detached attitude of philosophers has reflected that , so they probably do n't care . 
  interesting to see that you rate arrogance , ignorance , competence and experience to be at least 20 % compatible !, 
  that kind of rambling goes well with the accusations and arguments from seeming authority . 
  i ca n't much help you with the ard 's coverage , though - as i said i find them shallow , 15 minutes is a ridiculously short time for a news report . 
  ( and by the way , them being _ heavily _ spd-affiliated is n't exactly a conspiracy theory . ), 
  i watch pretty much only the heute journal on tv ( and sometimes the arte news ) , but as those are biased as well : for diverse coverage i can recommend adding every half-decent news outlet you can find ( regardless of affiliation , which you may find hard ) to a dedicated twitter account and installing an application that delivers their messages as a notification feed to your phone or computer . 
  thanks , i was being facetious - of course that was my conjecture , i was just poking fun at you having a language family so different that i could n't actually understand one of the words ( on a website hosting a presumably english article , no less !, 
  it 's probably safe to say that you do n't give a shit about the intricacies of greek fiscal policies , eu diplomacy or media integrity , yes . 
  a concern troll is someone who disturbs a group by saying `` this is offensively shallow , ca n't we all be _ reasonable _ by agreeing to my opinion ? 
  '' , which is exactly how i would paraphrase someone getting offended by the lightest of satire and using that perceived slight as an opportunity for grandstanding to show how much more _ reasonable _ they are . 
  i have no idea what that means literally , but _ real progressive , finland _ !, 
  i do n't watch the ard , it 's a shallow left-wing circlejerk . 
  but it 's nice to see my assumptions were correct . 
  luckily , your breed of concern troll is n't internationally appealing so you 'll have to make to with your domestic audience . 
  once you stop being *** extremely disappointed right now *** ( i assume you 're german yourself ? 
  ) , you might come to notice that this is from zeit magazin , a light-hearted side project of theirs . 
  they have weekly mime interviews where celebrities make fun of themselves , ffs ... 
  the question is whether seeing this as winking satire will be enough to not rekindle your *** extreme disappointment *** or if you 'll just say `` they 're kicking downwards '' then . 
  because frankly , that realization was n't all that much of a reach to begin with . 
  the jewishly smirking simitis in the first picture did n't give it away that those pictures are firmly tongue in cheek ? 
  it 's always funny to see people accusing others of being disingenuous , then using such base methods as accusing the subject of their criticism of `` an agenda '' , of course an unnamed one so people can fill in their personal political opponents . 
  `` dirndl '' means `` girl '' , so the word describes both the dress and the woman . 
  well yeah , `` not much worse than welt '' is n't exactly the gold standard . 
  though i particularly despise their charged rhetoric ( hence the play on `` abrasive '' ) - imho , it devalues the journalism behind it even further , but that 's just a personal opinion . 
  you attach `` pseudo-quality '' to welt and go on to quote taz as if it were anything more than very abrasive toilet paper ? 
  there 's not much beyond faz , zeit and sueddeutsche that i would even consider to quote ( papers , that is ) , and neither welt nor taz come remotely close to that ... 
  only the nordschwobe , and do n't worry , mer oberschwobe hate them as well . 
  goddamn stuttgart ruining the perception of our dialect ... 
  people always forget the kuattla . 
   i do n't really understand why certain europeans think all we eat is processed , chemical-laden , garbage . 
  probably because in every thread about obesity , claims that cooking is easy are met with `` that 's literally impossible in large parts of the us '' and `` most people do n't know how to do that '' ... 
  things like you see in / r/streetart are very much alright imho . 
  but most graffiti does n't look like that . 
  twain actually wrote a great travel report about germany that was thoroughly positive . 
  it 's more the metaphorical volume i was referring to , the limited selection of topics is just icing on the cake . 
  `` documentaries . '', 
  why does everything have to be some kind of - ism these days ? 
  it 's just a lazy way to make people shut up through pigeonholing . 
  with how rare such violence is in germany , i doubt you can make statistically sound assumptions here . 
  could have been anything from insanity to terrorism . 
  _ especially _ with someone not 100 % conscious , you want overwhelming force . 
  my mother is a psychiatrist , and some of the stories she tells me about people developing inhuman strength in such situations are frightening . 
   this shit is some weird sarcastical reverse-racism . 
  let 's keep that kind of crap in the us , please . 
  `` german '' is not a race and such complaints are beyond ridiculous . 
  that 's because they have no heart !, 
  they do n't need to import the third world any more , they grow it natively now . 
  you call it a `` greferendum '' , but not a `` grisis '' ?!, 
  sorry for the shitpost , but that ca n't be ignored . 
  edit : also , kudos for the megathread handling the last few times !, 
  the mod account is a good idea , and you seem to have _ really _ learned your lesson from the recent debacle . 
  yeah i was n't quite awake yet ... salaried workers do n't have to declare anything if they do n't want something back , at least here . 
  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/prosperous  having or characterized by financial success or good fortune ; ** flourishing ** ; successful : depends on the definition you 're thinking of . 
   in the implicit knowledge i did n't know receipts had anything to do with taxes until this thread . 
  i 'd be surprised if most people know . 
  well if you do n't you just get an estimate from the irs and have to pay up , so go ahead and do n't do your taxes ... which reminds me , i should do my taxes . 
  are n't latvia and lithuania prosperous ? 
  i thought the baltics were currently sprinting forwards in development . 
  i 'm out of the loop , where 's greece ? 
  is it a country ? 
  changed a bit in the iteration i just posted , now russia has world , europe , why moscow against while point greece ? 
  country-sorted version is available now !, 
  ( / u/osgood _ schlatter ) https://docs.zoho.com/sheet/published.do?rid=l3hhv51b3c098b15e427ba2cbc4d4df77aa60&amp;mode=html groups are here if someone is interested in the details : http://pastebin.com/9r2fhtbj i 'll probably be crucified for this , but whatever . 
  noted , thanks !, 
  i 'll see if i can find something . 
  it 's post count and average words - i. e. they made 1.5 k posts containing 42 words each on average , or 3 less than the average . 
  but identifying distinct users might also be interesting , this will be my third point on the agenda after country grouping and html output . 
  uhhhh ... yeah , i would , they 're horrible examples as i ca n't code , just throw something together that sorta works . 
  i 'm posting it all on pastebin as public domain - do what you want with it . 
  if you post them somewhere else , let me know . 
  http://pastebin.com/dtdftpvk - scraper http://pastebin.com/esqz6fnl - common functions http://pastebin.com/pbfeh5xf - dictionary condensation http://pastebin.com/jbw6ghqs - table generation edit : oh and the comments ( few as there are ) are probably off , the code is reused from another project of mine that 's more thought-through , i never intended to make this one public . 
  ah nice , did n't know you could do that !, 
  ( never used the service before . ), 
  next point of the agenda after country grouping will be to have the script output an html table with sorting and the like , that should make things easier . 
  a simple python script - basically , it saves the last seen comment and fetches everything periodically through cron . 
  yes , that would be interesting - i 'd just have to figure out which flair to assign to which country , and that could be a _ bit _ problematic in cases like basque country or abkhazia . 
  ( not to mention that i 'll probably screw up the basic facts as well . ), 
  ... oooh crap , i just noticed i must have stopped counting for the `` none '' flair . 
  it 's a special case in the code because the field is empty . 
  thanks for pointing me to it !, 
  i hope this works , never tried to publish a spreadsheet before . 
  also , the results are anything but surprising , but this program can run indefinitely and i plan on having it do so . 
  over the course of a year , this will become much more interesting . 
  this is mainly a test run ; if you have suggestions for improvement , please tell me !, 
  mainly the list for too common words could be tweaked - things like `` anyway '' are n't common , but they hold zero meaning , and i need a blacklist . 
  current one is here : http://pastebin.com/b3tbx8wy regexp blacklisting is also implemented , but not currently used . 
  also , the list gets condensed regularly and i try to merge plurals , possessives etc. 
  if someone has some regexp rules to improve this to suggest , they 're welcome as well .
