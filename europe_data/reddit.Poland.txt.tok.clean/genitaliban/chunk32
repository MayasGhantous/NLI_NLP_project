  edit : oh , / u/ownage4you made me think of it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b86ws/mods_of_reurope_stop_sweeping_islamist_violence/csjxd1x?context=3 ) . 
  but `` racist '' or `` racism '' are n't near the top anywhere . 
  how do you regard medved ? 
  as i recently learned , the galileo case was much more because he was an unscientific dick who ridiculed everyone who disagreed with him and could n't support his theories . 
  i read it on / r/askhistorians and inquired if this simplistic version is actually true enough and was told yes . 
  edit : oh and galileo was n't burned at the stake , merely sentenced to house arrest . 
  it actually has , yes . 
  yeah , there 's nothing you can do to disprove faith , that should be obvious to anyone with education in the sciences . 
  so as long as he does n't try to have people teach faith as science , this is nothing to argue about . 
  / r/circlebroke ( 2 ) user ... not exactly atypical . 
  yeah , so original ... 
  they were talking about individuals getting riled up to the point of violence , not about your dystopian economic fantasies . 
  and you forgot to include something with `` genocide '' , mass starvation alone does n't have the same `` punch '' . 
  please , if the zdf is too biased and populist for you , you have insane standards . 
  they have a slight slant on many issues and rarely go really deep , but they are pretty much universally accepted as the neutral center of germany 's media . 
  edit : oh wait , was that an honest question instead of a derisive statement about the zdf ? 
  then please disregard the dismissiveness in the beginning - the rest should answer the question . 
  yeah , would n't fit their mo - after all , how would they independently verify it ? 
  call me when you see us hauling stones at greeks ... 
  if that 's your idea of a worker 's paradise ... 
   you need to demonstrate loyalty to the socialist party in order to maintain your job . 
  sounds more like an ideological dictatorship than socialism to me . 
  curious , that ... 
  that would be more like indentured servitude . 
   what a scumbag move - . - ' . 
  someone in the megathread beautifully likened syriza to pontius pilate - setting the people up with a sham vote and washing their hands of it . 
  my thoughts exactly , and the pontius pilate analogy is beautiful . 
  the ghosts were in large part called by the media . 
  in the beginning , the afd was simply a mix of liberal conservatives and neoliberals with a strong focus on technocracy and realpolitik regardless of popularity . 
  a friend of mine was one of their candidates for bavaria and provided some insight . 
  by his account , he was one of the `` average '' afd : economy degree , mid - to high-level banker , classic liberal beliefs with conservative leanings similar to the conservative wing of the old fdp . 
  but as the party was portrayed as right-wing and populist in the media , more and more right-wing populists felt attracted to it , slowly shifting the core of the party in that direction . 
  thus , the allegations of extremism became more and more true , which obviously is n't tolerable company for a technocrat with a reputation in society to lose . 
  so they started bleeding members who simply wanted to do realpolitik , accelerating the process . 
  he himself has left quite a while ago because his goals were unachievable with the current structure , and as is evident from the news , this election the point where a lot of people decided the same . 
  the afd is effectively nonexistent now compared to their beginnings and has completely transformed . 
  of course the media is n't exclusively to blame , the party made a lot of mistakes because they were new and had n't expected to have to defend against a threat from the inside in this way . 
  but from past experiences with similar situations , i 'd definitely say there was a campaign to transform them in this way - old-fashioned liberal conservatism just is n't something that goes well with the average journalist . 
  oh well , too bad , it 's sad - germany _ direly _ needs a liberal party . 
  edit : and i 'm sorry , i wo n't be able to engage in in-depth discussion , just see this as a personal account / opinion . 
  i can only type with one hand right now and meds are killing my motor skills , the above took me a loong time to write ( 40min , looking at my history ) and my arm grows numb . 
  i expected a '' - buzzfeed '' there . 
  i know it 's trite to complain about the downfall of journalism , but this is simply depressing . 
  glad this trend has n't infected our reputable papers yet . 
   the scenario for adjusting prices down was when all migrants had spent all their economies after multiple failed tries to reach europe . 
  that 's assuming that no new migrants will arrive , though . 
  or at least assuming a theoretical scenario where the ones getting back _ all _ have truly _ no _ money left . 
  ( or we 're past a theoretical tipping point , depending on how i interpret your post . ), 
  so price pressure would increase in practice - the point that supply may increase stands , though , and can only be speculated upon . 
  another important , speculative factor would be the psychological one : what effect would the situation have on potential migrants when they are confronted with people returning disillusioned ? 
  it 's certainly not a long-term solution and nothing i 'd suggest seriously , but an interesting thought experiment . 
  why would they adjust their prices _ down _ if demand increases ( due to migrants now arriving from europe as well ) and supply does n't ( only so many boats and ports ) ? 
  they 're not running a charity organization to help people into a better life . 
  improbable . 
  how soon will they run out of money to pay for the limited and thus increasingly expensive capacities of the smugglers ? 
   made people argue between themselves . 
  yeah , would n't want that in a crisis ... 
  logical continuation of `` you 're just abusing us '' , `` it 's all lies and deceit '' , `` europe is actually stealing from greece '' , `` you 're responsible for us suffering '' and the popular favorite `` well you were nazis once , now gib '' . 
   yes , obviously . 
  just like the / r/askhistorians [ 1 ] mods filter the content and comments of that sub and provide excellent content as a consequence . 
  due to their expertise . 
  do our mods have that ? 
  dclauzel demonstrated otherwise when they tried to inject their personal opinion only a week ago and made the whole sub irate . 
  yeah , blocks me from _ so many _ places as a vpn user ... and if you have a killswitch and force all your traffic through the vpn , it 's everything but comfortable to quickly reach a website directly . 
  that would potentially allow mods to find out who different alts belong to . 
  not so great ... and virtually worthless anyway - you can choose between banning my vpn or my dynamic home ip , for example . 
  but i do n't think anything will come of this , anyway , so go ahead . 
   removal of alternative accounts wait , what , you want them to ban alts ? 
  ... nor how it 's distributed over time . 
   to not stand cold weather is much more practical than warm !, 
  you just put a jacket or something and you 're fine !, 
  yeah , seriously ... 
  i have no problem going out in a t-shirt at freezing temperatures , it 's actually kind of pleasant , but anything above 20 degrees is too hot for me and there 's absolutely nothing to be done about that . 
  so in the winter , i get weird stares when i try to be comfortable , and in the summer i barely risk taking a step outside . 
  it sucks , and that 's not even talking about suit-and-tie occasions . 
  zoom in . 
  that 's not an omega .

  now i 'll let this run for a year . 
  hmmmm , it should be interesting to make a word frequency analysis based on users ' flair ... and fairly easy , too . 
  what ? 
  no , i mean it breeds sentiments like `` so what if the _ right _ people abuse their power '' . 
  i did n't say you were , your comment could have been interpreted as a demand for a rule change . 
  but ideology in general usually breeds that kind of self-righteous crap . 
  it really does n't matter what you want or not - as long as the moderation principles and rules do n't state as much , that content is allowed here and one mod is not allowed to let their personal agenda determine otherwise . 
  that the so-called progressive people are again saying `` so what if the _ right _ people abuse their power '' is n't exactly surprising , but any neutral observer should be able to see that 's no way to govern a community . 
  except dclauzel as a moderator has almost literally said they want to ( as if it was n't obvious enough ) . 
  this is n't even a political issue , it 's an issue with a mod - _ again _ . 
  i was n't talking about you specifically , i just tried submitting patches to open source projects for a while and have received zero responses . 
  hence the more aggressive approach . 
  already did , but i 've had bad experiences with such suggestions being flat-out ignored if there was n't any chance for public support , and most people do n't visit that sub . 
  last place i spam my suggestion in case this becomes a larger discussion , maybe it 'll get some visibility : http://www.reddit.com/r/testsub_genitaliban/comments/3b7zn5/test/ just hover the posts with your mouse and the language changes . 
  so , to get rid of dclauzel ? 
  and it 's _ completely _ derailed discussion about the event itself . 
  so , mission accomplished . 
  and it 's when you want to be incisive and hurtful . 
  `` sarcasm '' is n't equivalent to any minor facetiousness . 
  as '' / s '' now stands for the latter , it means pretty much `` not sarcasm '' by now .
