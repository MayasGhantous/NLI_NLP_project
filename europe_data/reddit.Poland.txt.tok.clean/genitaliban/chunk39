  this does n't really make sense . 
  for one thing , why was he not shot on the spot ? 
  and if they were three , why did n't they just detonate one at the security checkpoint and have the other two storm into the stadium ? 
  ca n't be _ that _ hard to shoot your way in there . 
   late estonians now would recognize german and french ... how did that word end up in there ? 
  edit : ooooh , `` sp\u00e4t estens '' . 
  jesus , at least wait until someone actually _ says _ something for you to willingly misinterpret , doing so with a hypothetical position is a bit much ... 
   what you say is equivalent to saying : personal protection equipment like hard hats or steelcap boots are useless , because accidents still happen . 
  it 's more like wearing a 30cm buttplug at all times so nobody can rape you in the ass . 
  that 's a question , not an answer . 
  of course , with the political situation in turkey it 's very reasonable to be suspicious , but do n't paint suspicion as _ proof _ . 
  there was a similar case in germany some ten years ago with nine dead , it does seem like the most likely scenario . 
  seven babies going missing would _ probably _ have been reported to the police before . 
  there 's no such thing as an ip crypter . 
  it 's like writing a letter and supplying a fake address as your own in its header - you would n't expect the reply to reach you . 
  it could be circumvented with a vpn , though , which in this analogy would be like sending the letter through your lawyer while you stay anonymous . 
  that 's not usually necessary for the level of tech such blocks use , most will easily be circumvented if you do n't use a nameserver that falls under the jurisdiction of the government in question . 
  ( stretching the analogy here , but that 's the guy who looks up an address on the map to tell the postman where to go and can be forced to misdirect them to a government site . ), 
  exactly . 
  i can recommend dnscrypt : https://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/ it 's a step beyond just using google 's dns or something like that , but it 's a completely uncensored , secure solution that can easily be coupled with a caching local nameserver . 
  that means 1 . 
  uncensored dns responses 2 . 
  no spoofing or other practices to change the replying server 3 . 
  no alterations to the data stream itself possible 4 . 
  no sniffing of visited sites , no leak attacks against vpn users etc 5 . 
  control over the transport mechanism for greater resilience against authorities blocking uncensored dns servers 6 . 
  easy control over your dns cache , i. e. less queries that take time ( with a caching nameserver ) 7 . 
  better rulesets for determining what server to use in what case ( with a caching nameserver ) [ edit : just changing your dns by ` ordinary ' means would eliminate everything past the first point . 
  and the first point is of course not verifiable in either case , but i 'd trust someone who develops such a system more than other dns server providers . ], 
  linux instructions are [ here ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dnscrypt ) ( not really arch-specific ) , i do n't know how to do it on windows or mac os . 
  i 've not noticed any kind of drawback apart from the setup process taking some effort and new names not being propagated as quickly ( which should n't really be an issue to the average user ) . 
  i thought the article linked in the post you linked to put it quite nicely :  but this is what happens when nuance becomes a shield behind which to conceal one 's dishonesty , while vague platitudes become the sword with which to fend off critical thought . 
   i 'm allowed to be hyperbolic just as people can claim that an actual holocaust-denier was just having an opinion . 
  yes , of course you are , if you want your opinion to appear as valuable as theirs . 
  with the added bonus that you 're actively abusing and damaging a concept instead of just having a bit of a naive view of it . 
  that 's beside the point . 
  naive , illogical , call the concept what you like , but as i said saying that thinking so means you deny the holocaust is somewhere between ridiculous and disgusting and means you should n't be taken seriously . 
  you have n't yet emerged as one of the people here who call everyone racists if they dare disagree , but if you follow your line of thinking further , we sure wo n't have to wait very long . 
   love when the holocaust-denier supporters come to play . 
  how appallingly unnecessary ... accept that some people see free speech as something that ca n't be partitioned , period . 
  it does n't matter if you agree or not or if there is any merit to the concept at all , deriding them as `` holocaust denier supporters '' is n't even an attempt at an argument . 
  please return with a study on how many 12yos even heard the _ name _ of kks . 
  and that 's making it easy for you ... 
  because yours are probably some of the first search results when you type `` german hip-hop '' into google . 
  it 's not like the artists i posted were generally considered hacks . 
  unfortunately many of my favorites do n't have videos ( [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crl7gbefqxk ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qq2ayx_bzw ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hm_3kxase8 ) , [ 4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js7trrsusrc ) etc ) , but some others in no particular order : [ jim pansen - ihr koennt heulen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1-sg1x9b4w ) ( `` you may cry '' , classic ego track ) [ umse feat . 
  wordsworth - lass mal gut sein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb1i12b5iw0 ) ( `` stop it already '' , criticism of the scene ) [ dissziplin - ich bin deutschland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09ijowen4w ) ( `` i am germany '' , political song about leaving the past ) [ creutzfeldt & jakob feat . 
  king kool savas - fehdehandschuh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y_wimwoemi ) ( `` the gauntlet '' , basically represents the transition between popular styles ) [ laas unltd . 
  - nein wir kenn ' dich nicht ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vamvzaruyi ) ( `` no , we do n't know you '' , ridicules `` hip hop snobs '' ) [ blumio - meine lieblingsrapper ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2bxilfnhhe ) ( `` my favorite rappers '' , light-hearted persiflage / hommage about some of the biggest names in german hip-hop ) [ king kool savas - das urteil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flll2ld4ie40 ) ( `` the sentencing '' , diss track ) [ alligatoah - mein gott hat den laengsten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q27bkaoxrpc ) ( `` my god has the longest [ dick ] '' , makes light of religious extremists ) [ kiz - neuruppin ] ( http://www.kiz-neuruppin.de/ ) ( interactive , `` horror rap '' - the band usually portrays themselves as psychopathic serial killers amongst others ) [ rhymin ' simon - kingpintin ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vqqjswwunm ) ( something like `` king-dicking '' , porn-party rap ) [ prinz pi - gib dem affen zucker ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy3i_xacng ) ( `` feed the monkey [ with sugar ] '' , party rap ) i could probably keep adding videos indefinitely because germany has a lot of great hip-hop , but i think this provides a decent sample of different styles . 
  well , obviously ... 
  can they not eat any kind of lung there or just sheep 's lung ? 
  this does n't appear to make a whole lot of sense . 
  if there 's no calf lung cartel trying to keep the scottish down or this is a controversial topic for other reasons , it may be the better idea to change the law instead of changing a traditional food ... 
  you reply to criticism of neues deutschland by linking to junge welt ? 
  i 'm sure jungle world has some `` insightful '' piece as well you want to continue the progression ... 
  no task force , at least not according to the article , just a focused enforcement of law by `` normal '' forces driven by homeland security . 
  neues deutschland is n't exactly the best source if you 're interested in facts . 
   until then , you can only argument with your own fears and anxieties . 
  as opposed to your own calm ratio , which i am _ sure _ would have compelled you to support a conservative chancellor five years ago with _ zero _ regard for how much you agreed with their policies . 
  you marched for unwavering , unequivocal support for kohl 's every word in ' 97 , right ? 
  he definitely would n't be a puppet , though , and has accumulated _ way _ too much hate both domestically and internationally for his paranoia and fiscal policies , respectively . 
  _ if _ there is an uprising driven by de maiziere , schaeuble would probably be the worst successor to merkel he could suggest . 
  misrepresentative language so thickly coated in sarcasm and other bile that it 's impossible to make sense of is n't `` exposing '' anything except the speaker 's untrustworthiness . 
   translation : sent back to unfriendly hungary or italy biased nonsense . 
  `` ungastlich '' means they 're not very accommodating hosts , not `` unfriendly '' . 
  that 's objectively true . 
  and your other quote is completely out of context . 
  i 've said that for quite a while myself , but de maiziere putting forth two substantial policy changes without her being involved at all is worrying to say the least . 
  makes me think he may actually have some kind of viable candidate the public has n't yet been made aware of as such - parts of the party are n't exactly happy with the situation , there ( always ) is some potential in younger members and it would fit my view of him to attempt to put a half-puppet in merkel 's place . 
   they 're firing mortars from helicopters . 
  that sounds like an incredibly stupid idea with great slapstick potential . 
  but i 'm sure they know what they 're doing . 
  they 're representative of a large segment of the german population at least . 
  ... and would otherwise not have been listed in the first place . 
  which makes the logic behind their comment a bit hard to understand . 
  we 'll easily be able to afford increasing numbers financially - yeah , it might kill the idea of a budget surplus , but there 's no way we 'll be brought to our knees economically . 
  the social `` costs '' and scaling up the bureaucracy etc. 
  to manage the flow would have disastrous effects way before we run out of money . 
  ... while at home , they drink 200yo brandy out of teenage hookers ' navels . 
  ff is great software , but ... 
  upvoted or not , intelligent articles and intelligent writers are in short supply regardless of topic . 
  it 's not like everybody _ wants _ to see simplistic articles on the frontpage , but they have to do if there 's nothing better available . 
  automod probably ate it and the mods allowed it to be shown after you posted . 
  or just be gay domestically . 
  privacy badger is the eff 's replacement for ghostery . 
  it has a somewhat different set of functions but is open source . 
  oh , it 's a great substitute for rss , that 's what i use it for - no quicker way to read very different takes on a single story . 
  however , 95 % of the content is about as useful as a post on / r/funny ( if it 's not made by someone whose identity makes it newsworthy by itself ) . 
  as i hinted to , there certainly are more avenues for attacks ( targeted and universal ) , but what i listed protects you from the vast majority . 
  if you 're in a position where you have to be _ really _ protective , richard stallman provides a ( presumably as much as possible ) air-tight concept here : https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html, 
  but i 'd add merkel to that list , she has an enormous amount of political instinct . 
  i thought we decided not to reply to each others ' shitposts any more ? 
  eh , i 'd have no problem if clear opt-out legislation for such things were to exist . 
  globally speaking , a minority of people cares about their privacy - if some universal standards by which they could enforce that existed , that would be alright . 
  everyone has some sort of relative who could help them to claim such a right . 
  i manage the pcs of quite a few relatives - they are often concerned about their privacy , and i 'm sure they would simply ask me to enable some generic `` respect my privacy '' header if i could . 
  right now , i 'm unfortunately stuck with installing addons they wo n't really notice - there 's no reasonable way to explain to my grandma what noscript does , she has trouble understanding what a button is . 
   why would you read it that way ? 
  not exactly surprising that schmidt 's pragmatism would trigger people who despise pragmatism . 
  well , schroeder 's agenda 2010 was an _ extremely _ important piece of legislation and his legacy as a chancellor , but apart from that , he was a clown with `` gazprom '' and `` hol mir ma ne flasche bier '' as his most important heritage .
