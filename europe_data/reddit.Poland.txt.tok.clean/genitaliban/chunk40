  no way his voice will ever be respected in the future , he was way too `` hemdsaermlig '' for anyone to even ask him about his opinions . 
  at that time it was probably true , but kohl went on to be almost as highly respected . 
  really , the sequence of brandt , schmidt , kohl is probably one of the most remarkable streaks of competent leaders in history . 
  ( edit : still , that remark is _ very _ characteristic of schmidt and a good answer to your initial question about a tl ; dr. ), 
  not giving people a clear opt-out that could be certified as genuine is the problem . 
  you do n't because you ca n't . 
  js is important for a lot of legitimate uses as well as dubious ones . 
  you _ could _ try defining what parts of its function set are allowed to run , but i do n't think you could come up with a solution that would n't tear holes in either functionality or privacy . 
  no , ghostery blocks connections to sites that track plus a few other things , noscript prevents _ all _ sites from running scripts on your computer . 
  they aim at completely different problems and do n't have a lot of overlap in practice . 
  without access to the entirety of their software and all their servers ( and both for associated companies as well ) , nobody could tell at all . 
  and a comprehensive audit of all of google is somewhat unlikely to happen , if only due to the giganteousness of the task . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure , but reverse image search points towards it being her . 
  ( next to her sister here : http://media.riemurasia.net/albumit/m00/1460222202.jpg , sister next to daddy here : http://www.news.at/_storage/asset/4990025/storage/newsat:key-visual/file/68135640/russiavoteputin.jpg ) apparently , putin has kept them under wraps for security reasons so there are few photos of them . 
  and donottrack is one of their primary considerations when designing their services . 
  it 's public source - not as good ethically , but no real drawback for security considerations if you can validate your build against theirs . 
  you could use chromium , that 's the basic version of chrome without google extensions . 
  it 's open source and afaik considered trustworthy . 
  ( say what you will about google , i respect their approach of providing open source `` clean '' applications like chromium or aosp and only fucking the asses of those who do n't really care with chrome or android . ), 
  for further protection , also consider cookie monster , requestpolicy , privacy badger , betterprivacy and random agent spoofer . 
  ( those are for firefox , maybe someone can name the chrom [ e | ium ] equivalents . ), 
  - noscript prevents javascript from running scripts that identify you by determining how the browser handles them - cookie monster allows you to set per-site cookie permissions easily - requestpolicy allows you to determine what sites are allowed to load content from other sites - privacy badger blocks hosts that are commonly used for tracking - betterprivacy eliminates so-called supercookies , i. e. cookies set by nonstandard means such as flash 's local storage objects - random agent spoofer falsifies the self-identification of your browser , which is a significant bit of information when combined with other identifiers handling all those in combination is taxing , but it paints a _ very _ clear picture on just how much data is collected through various means . 
  and i 'm sure that 's not complete protection at all , it just makes the `` cost '' of identifying you higher so companies will focus on easier targets . 
  edit : it 's also never a bad idea to add https everyhwere ( makes connections encrypted wherever possible ) , dnssec/tlsa validator ( provides further checks on site validity and encryption security ) and smart referrer ( blocks sites from knowing what other site you came from ) . 
  those will only very rarely be felt at all . 
  even more than for his influential chancellorship , he was respected across the political spectrum for making very clear and insightful comments on politics and society without giving much thought to diplomatic restraint . 
  a sad day for germany . 
  http://media.2oceansvibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/putina5.jpg considerably more boobs , as it turns out . 
  also , now i 'm looking at naked pictures of obama 's mom . 
  celebrity magazines are interesting . 
  but not in a good way . 
  you 'd think the pure slavness as such would be inherited , not that genetics would curse her with looking like a copy plus tits . 
  `` twitter '' is just a different way of spelling `` idiot on mobile '' , maybe combined with `` idiots with a keyboard trying to exploit idiots on mobile '' . 
  the article 's logic is equivalent to saying `` muricans most healthy people on the planet '' because they pay out the ass for basic medicine . 
  it only warrants pity , not saltiness . 
  lookie there , the rare zuckerbot ... at least have the decency to say `` i do n't mind selling my ass '' instead of misleading people by spewing nonsense like you 're doing all over this thread . 
   also - what exactly is being tracked ? 
  facebook ( just like other companies ) serves their button from their servers . 
  that means they can supply a unique id with it and see who accesses it . 
  in the simplest form , just serve it as an image `` likebutton \\ _ 123456789abcdefg . png '' , then note what site it was placed on ; if someone loads the site , a request to download that image is made and you know `` ip 123.123.123.123 accessed www.example.com '' . 
  if you extend the concept to every single `` like '' button on the internet and every single ad served , you may realize just _ how _ much the big companies know about you - and many times , you wo n't even realize because they just put transparent 1x1px images on a site to do the same . 
  furthermore , they may employ techniques like placing a cookie or using javascript to identify you even if your ip changes or if multiple people share your ip . 
  install the addon `` collusion '' ( available at least for firefox and chromium ) to visualize it - it generates a [ graph ] ( http://www.bostonmediadomain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/collusion-update.png ) that outlines where your cross-site requests went to . 
  you can be sure that facebook and google sit in the middle of that web like fat ugly spiders . 
  edit : but do note that this behavior is sometimes `` necessary '' in order to have a cleanly structured site - e. g. wikipedia makes cross-site requests to wikimedia to serve images , which is not a privacy problem at all . 
  they 're busy facepalming . 
  seriously , people not fulfilling their politically correct duty of pointing out the idiocy of their peers is not literally kristallnacht as some people in this thread would have you believe ... 
  i think that leftist current existed here before we had a single arab . 
  they consider themselves anti-imperialist . 
  ignoring that you 're obviously ignoring the circumstances , not even overtolerance and xenophobia exclude each other globally when we 're talking about single european cities behaving moronically . 
  it sounds like a name my mother would have laughed at in '95 for being to obviously an attempt to sound `` hip '' ... 
  well , their nickname is `` pushover party '' - make of that what you will , there sure is some scapegoating to it , but it 's partly deserved still . 
   the recent attacks on refugees reminded me of kristallnacht . 
   you guys are really overplaying that card . 
  greens and fdp had a good go at proving themselves worthless as well , linke is pretty much a joke a priori , and anybody else would soon enough notice that yelling `` raaaaaaaaaaargh '' does n't constitute politics once you 're in power . 
  most of the shift is due to protest votes , though . 
  no sane person would think the current afd or the linke could run the country ... you could even say the same about any parties _ but _ the union right now . 
  ( especially if you think their policies in this matter are too liberal . ), 
  the union has been in a very comfortable and mutually beneficial arrangement like this . 
  it would be a seismic change that would shatter pretty much all german politics if they were to split , it 's _ extremely _ unlikely . 
  parts of either party leaving and reorganizing themselves is far more likely . 
  ( edit : and that goes for both a conservative liberal offshoot of the cdu and a national conservative offshoot of the csu since neither would be tainted from the start . 
  either would probably do some good to our country 's political landscape . ), 
  just to make it clear , 2ch is an ancient japanese board , they existed not long after i first started using the www . 
  i do n't know how the power dynamic developed , but they 're probably what any non-russian who used chans at all would think of first and do n't seem to be identical with 2ch . hk . 
  plenty of translations online , but it 's pretty much `` i was drunk and could n't get home '' . 
  i 'm not sure if it was ever popular outside alemannic regions , but during that time [ hubert von goisern ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-xybjoknmg ) was popular near the lake as well so maybe it was a kind of ostrarrichi fad . 
  ( also , come to think of it , stermann & grissemann were huge during that time and it 's when i 'd have learned of kreisler if i was n't such a hipster . ), 
   also a psw : the more polite all of our users are in these amas , the higher the chances are that we 'll be able to get more and better amas in the future . 
  obviously , but arranging amas from people who trigger half of the sub with every one of their tenets might not be the best strategy to effect that . 
  i mean , `` meps 4 wildlife '' should make any decent person angry . 
  also not that different from ( truly ) alemannic swabians , for some reason people think we 're a monolithic entity from stuttgart to lindau . 
  like , [ `` vo mellou bis ge schoppornou '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmi2m06yffc ) shares a lot of grammar and sounds with how my friends from youth used to talk . 
  2ch is russian now ? 
  what ? 
  you are if you have the license . 
   i admit my german is n't very good , but i would swear `` asylbewerber '' refers to asylum seekers . 
  no , asylbewerber are those who actually filed their application , which takes a while after arriving as an asylum seeker . 
  pepper spray is n't legal for use on humans , but tear gas is , which is what the article refers to . 
  though i 'd assume you could convince a judge that you were carrying it to protect yourself against animals ( dogs ) and just used what was at hand , as well as they could `` convince '' you you used tear gas not in an entirely legal way . 
  but that 's just a guess . 
  `` you '' , `` you '' , `` you '' ... are you finished with contradicting yourself ? 
  i thought i was the one who knew what political ideology i follow , which rings true because you obviously have no idea . 
  shitting on words like `` fascist '' by using them as everyday insults _ is _ dismantling those lessons . 
  the only ones who that serves in the short term is you ( approximately until this thread ends ) , and after that you will only have benefited the exact people you seem to oppose . 
  such thoughtless use of language only creates a dysphemism treadmill , with the interesting dynamic that those who created it also do n't want to make new words to describe , you know , _ actual _ fascists , neo-nazis and the like . 
  keep inferring , insulting , misrepresenting , maybe you 'll at least be able to fool yourself that i 'm just another nazi . 
  cynical but true . 
  let 's hope the `` old '' fdp resurges amongst all this . 
  you should be sorry for attempting to dismantle the core lessons of the 20th century . 
  and you even appear to think you 're following them ... 
  in some weird universe where there are two diametrically opposed political positions maybe , `` the fascists '' and `` the good guys '' ... 
   well , you can count all other totally-not-nazi-but-remove-kebab-remove-kebab parties as their direct predecessors , ich mache mir die welt widde-widde-wie sie mir gefaellt !, 
  and your biased reading of their post is the best standard for the official meaning because ... ? 
  is n't your country 's situation the average redditor 's dream ? 
  ok , you 're still 35 % short , but getting pretty close . 
  maybe they just have a very reasonable definition of what `` beer '' means . 
  very interesting . 
  we do n't really have large-scale problems with people unwilling to have their children educated ( hence the `` in theory '' above ) , but gypsy immigration might be an interesting testing ground for our laws - no idea how the _ actual _ response would look like . 
  fortunately , we have an amusing lack of pc respect for gypsies compared to other victims of the holocaust , so there will probably be no special provision to ensure that people stay on a monkey level of education .
