  if you do n't plan to enter the uk , why would it faze you ? 
  laugh at the uk companies / officials if you so desire , but i do n't think a foreign nation 's laws would concern you all that much - possibly _ even if _ you went there on business . 
  ( i know little about law , but it would just seem ridiculous to arrest a foreign national on such minor and political charges , especially idf your country has some weight in diplomacy . ), 
  i have to say , what your people apparently ` want ' to say finland looks like is exactly what it _ does _ look like . 
  i traveled the country north to south in like 15 days , and every single view of note ( obv . 
  outside the most populated cities ) looked like this , it 's infuriating . 
  norway and sweden were _ so _ much more enjoyable . 
  really made me wish i had allotted more time to seeing the west instead of trusting in cliches being `` not that accurate '' , but nope , trees and lakes and hills , trees and lakes and hills , trees ... helsinki and tampere were still awesome , though . 
  of course it 's a generalization , you sometimes hear about refugees genuinely settling in countries that are n't really favorable toward them or rich - i think those are the ones that nobody doubts . 
  most of the rest have at least a component of ` economic migrance ' , and the larger it is the more negatively people will react . 
  admittedly i did n't watch the whole thing because the style is aggravating , but if that 's true , the netherlands are completely different from germany and from what i they appeared to be during my ( single short ) visit . 
  i thought the dutch as one of the countries with the most mixed population and the least regard for their origins ( you do n't usually _ speak _ dutch , ffs ! ), 
  would n't be racist in the literal sense at all . 
  an authoritarian law pushed through by talking about terrorists being used to limit people 's freedoms ?!, 
  how shocking , tell me it ai n't so !, 
  edit : ** article has been changed , mainly to include more explanations etc. , plus some language choices that change the tone more towards being critical of de maiziere 's statement . 
  news item as such stays the same . 
  ** i 'm not going to translate literally literally , would use some unnecessary processing cycles .

  also , for context , germany is currently ruled be a center coalition of the two biggest parties , center-left ( spd , social democrat ) and center-right ( cdu , [ nominally ] christian conservative ) with anyone else having had any semblance of balls removed and the center-left partner being subdued by merkel . 
  ( and the voters ' will after a decade of incompetence . ), 
  the center-left has has also lost some key positions to merkel who reclaimed them for use by the center-right . 
  -- # [ intro ] following his foray to limit asylum rights for syrians , the minister of the interior de maizi\u00e8re has backtracked . 
  apparently , nobody knew of it in the chancellor 's office . 
  and especially [ social democrat coalition partner ] spd was irritated . 
  `` this is the first time that de maizi\u00e8re has made himself vulnerable politically '' , [ public broadcaster ] zdf correspondent thomas walde said . 
  `` de maizi\u00e8re himself has followed a harder line than the spd or merkel for quite a while . 
  his surprising push concerning the asylum rights for syrians lacks political instinct . 
  it 's embarrassing for him to have to backtrack '' , walde emphasized . 
  [ ... see past submissions for context ... ] #all changes are to be discussed in the coalition ahead of time the ministry of the interior quickly focused their resources on roping in the minister 's idea . 
  there was currently no change in the practical handling of syrians ' applications , a speaker said in the evening . 
  but while the responsible office had been asked to revert syrians ' protection status to `` subsidiary '' [ limited in time and rights ] if they were ` nt persecuted personally , the coalition 's general agreements on family reuinification required further talks . 
  `` the current policy will remain . 
  all changes will have to be debated within the coalition . '', 
  [ ... chancellor 's office is displeased ... ] the spd promptly announced their resistance . 
  `` this does n't match the agreements '' , spd vice president ralf stegner told the `` passau new press '' . 
  attempts to toughen the agreements after the fact would '' not come to fruition '' . 
  [ ... context again , faz reported it first . 
  then an explanation of the status ... ] #greens outraged at proposal the greens ' family politician franziska brantner stated her outrage at the planned changes : `` if it is true that the the union [ centre-right coalition partner ] is to extend limits on family reuinification to syrians , that would be outragous . '', 
  if the union were to succeed with their push , `` more women and children would be forced to use life-threatening boat routes set up by people smugglers - further tragedies in the mediterranean would be a certainty . '', 
  [ ... context on the refugee situation in general ... ] -- personally , i think the manner of speaking points towards this being an attempt to test the political and public environment . 
  and for de maiziere to make that kind of statement without _ any _ kind of coordination would be _ completely _ out of character . 
  as i perceive him , he 's simply a bureaucrat - a very good bureaucrat , but not an idealist who would endanger their career like this . 
  and he has enough reputation of integrity to sacrifice some small part of it for such a test . 
  i always liked the `` library of babel '' idea better , anyway . 
  ah , so even worse than i thought - something between nihilism and fatalism soured with pure , humorless and unreleased bile . 
  yeah , that 's what i 'm drawn to , too , but it might not really be the best solution simply for egoistic reasons . 
  take the next step into apocalyptic hedonism if nothing else , that 's at least fun . 
  and i do n't think you expected a line-by-line reply to your post , but i know very well what you 're feeling , no matter the political stance . 
  this is only the time for populists to rejoice . 
  my emotional solution would be to radically eliminate emotion from the discussion , but ... yeah , well . 
  ah , that 's what you meant ... yeah , i think that might be just a little too paranoid . 
  but i 'm just 10,000 monkeys with a keyboard , so how should i know ? 
   that 's like saying the term auto and car have wholly different implications , both are words in different languages who refer to exactly the same thing . 
  well , of course if you 'd use two terms meaning the exact same thing with no relevant verbal meaning of their own , you can make the very convincing argument that they 'd mean the exact same thing ... that 's like saying `` one '' and `` 1 '' mean the same thing so there 's no difference between `` war '' and `` disagreement '' . 
  that 's not `` massive '' at all , interesting threads have that amount in half an hour here . 
  and this is a major and somewhat unexpected development , so obviously people would discuss it . 
  ... sooo , has someone stolen your password or are you drunk ? 
  that does n't even sound like you 're talking counterfactually , i 'm not used to that kind of platitudes from you . 
  or is it just nihilistic sardonism ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  edit : and in case _ this _ comes across sarcastically now , it 's really not , i 've just seen you defend center-left points in very reasonable ways before so this just ... does n't make sense . 
  `` new '' in the meaning that it had n't really entered the public 's mind . 
  some few percent being granted some unusual standard is n't very good news . 
  that 's awesome . 
  ... or makes them . 
  oh , yeah in _ law _ maybe , i 'm not exactly too fond of that field so i would n't know . 
  but you have to agree that the implications of the words are wholly different . 
  you could n't say something like `` they 're not refugees '' in `` standard '' german like you 've seen english speakers doing here on this sub in the past months . 
  well , no , `` fleeing for refuge '' does _ not _ mean the same as `` fleeing '' . 
  `` refuge '' in an international context ( as fluechtling is used ) means that there is a safe harbor for you somewhere ; just fleeing does n't imply that . 
  `` fluechtling '' otoh does n't necessarily imply that the receiving country will be willing to grant refuge , hence why it can be applied to economic migrants without a problem . 
  that 's exactly the way our government uses the term - they 're `` fluechtlinge '' regardless of motivation . 
  you 're too fast ... 
  the federal government has said that refugees \\* from syria will only be granted `` subsidiary protection '' in the future , which will not allow them to reunite with their families , among others . 
  the minister of the interior de maiziere surprisingly announced the plans . 
  -- i. e. another reputable source confirms . 
  also , the \\* , since this mistranslation is a personal pet peeve of mine - `` fluechtling '' does not mean `` refugee '' per se , it just means `` fleeing person '' without specifying what they 're fleeing from . 
  `` refugee '' on the other hand says they 've been granted or are to be granted refuge , not so sure what the english term implies . 
  still , you commonly see the german word translated into `` refugee '' without question , which is simply wrong , strictly speaking . 
  it applies in this case because syrians _ are _ considered refugees save for some irrelevant few . 
  and `` subsidiary protection '' , according to heute , is so far an uncommon term in germany and would bring with it several restrictions ( such as granting only a one-year residence permission ) and of course ( as newly added ) the inability to bring family members to the host country . 
   now , they are not forced so they just do n't go . 
  you have no enforced education ?!, 
  here , everybody is forced to school until they are 16 . 
  ( i 'm sure there are exceptions , such as the obvious ones like severe disabilities , but that 's the general rule . 
  at least in theory . ), 
  no , i really do n't think so . 
  http://ensv.dict.cc/?s=barn everything i can find points toward it meaning `` child '' . 
  also compare with scottish `` bairn '' and the cognates in the other nordic languages . 
  i 've only seen this weird notion of calling 17yos `` children '' in anglo countries . 
  probably because they do n't have a good word for `` adolescent '' . 
  ... no , with unjustified aggression like yours you just shot yourself in the foot . 
  but hey , let 's always assume the worst - they must be trolling , no way they may simply not be understanding what your angry one-liners demand from them !, 
  he says `` flyktingbarn '' , which afaik literally means `` flee-er child '' , not `` minor '' . 
  ( appears that swedish has the same concept as german with the more neutral `` flee-er '' word compared to `` refugee '' . ), 
  or at least that 's the only way i 've seen it used when i was in sweden . 
   even though i agree with your first part , left is definitely hypocritical , the right is equally ludicrous on muslim issue like u/mos _ fet pointed out , both sides are pretty much eachothers reflection . 
  and their caricatures by the their rabid opponents are the same . 
  or even those by the mainstream ones , as evident in your comment .
