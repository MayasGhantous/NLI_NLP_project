  furthermore , we just had an extremely strenuous election , and there was a whole host of more important topics ( yes , those exist ) to be debated . 
  let 's just wait for the new government to settle in first . 
  and if the symbolical head of state makes a symbolical gesture , that 's the most direct expression of an opinion anyone can ever expect from a nation as a whole . 
  what kind of separatist group in existence would put swabians and badenians [ german south-west ] in the same nation ?!, 
  we practically hate each other . 
  we 're talking about completely different things here . 
  just because emotions _ motivate _ people to take a certain stance does not at all imply that the point must be defended in emotionally appealing way , particularly if the displayed emotions are meant to sway the reader or beat down the opponent . 
  that 's eristic , and it 's the opposite of a good , productive and truthful debate style . 
  no , i just do n't like people not maintaining proper emotional distance to the subject of a discussion , and aggressive language is a sign of that . 
  that 's why i inferred a certain stance into your comment above . 
  discussing such things emotionally will never , ever lead to a conclusion applicable to the whole of a democratic society , only reason can . 
  strong emotions in politics lead to extremist regimes . 
  your tone was very confrontative , do n't you notice that ? 
  and you immediately started using vocabulary that has no place in a reasonable debate . 
  no , that the automatism to call someone a nazi / racist is worst in germany and scandinavia , respectively . 
  but considering your display of aggression , you probably think that 's a good thing . 
  true , but germany takes this to the extremes . 
  i think we 're on par with scandinavia in this context . 
  yes . 
  it is n't . 
  in the `` differences between the us and europe '' threads , those from the us often openly state that the friendliness is indeed superficial and formulaic and that statements like `` how are you '' are n't made to get an honest response . 
  europeans , as far as i got to know them , are n't friendly to people they do n't know and like , which i very much prefer above the us sentiment . 
  that 's not to say that one is inherently better or worse , they 're just two different approaches to social interaction . 
  i just said that _ i _ prefer this , not that everyone has to . 
  i much prefer european sincerity over us superficiality . 
  that 's not only reddit , that 's 90 percent of the `` it 's natural , _ maaan _ ! '', 
  crowd . 
  both . 
   why is it only english that 's so looked down on today ? 
  because there 's usually zero enrichment and only displacement . 
  i do think french has a native word for `` bike '' . 
  the black man ( if he 's the same as in germany ) is n't black by skin color , it just means `` shadow man '' . 
  i meant romanians in general , not you personally . 
   and what about people with immunodeficiency ? 
  those are exceedingly rare and leprosy is probably the least of their concerns . 
  if it does n't spread to or is carried by people with an intact immune system , they 'll never come into contact with it . 
  and tb is of course a very different animal and something that should be carefully screened for . 
   when germany made the agreement to take in 800,000 asylum seekers ... what agreement ? 
  that 's simply a projected figure of the number of `` unexpected '' migrants expected to arrive , no more no less . 
   for example , it 's not possible for a white to be oppressed/discriminated by a non-white the same way you ca n't be oppressed by your dog or a cat . 
  heh , that 's a nicely succinct ( if simplistic ) way of putting it . 
  leprosy is n't really that infectious , actually - you have to try to contract it if you do n't live in very bad conditions . 
  not to say that people should n't be checked for it , of course ; eradicating the disease is a global objective , but it 's not necessary to be fearful of it . 
   he took his wife to syria , then moved to romania for good , despite having the chance to live even in america . 
  wow , that 's how you describe your own country ? 
  and i thought germans had a fetish for flagellating themselves ... 
  ah , i had n't thought of mentioning motifs when submitting the post . 
  there are many very interesting ones as well , and they appear to be surprisingly similar across europe - for instance , the nightmare as an elf that chokes people in their sleep , the changeling as a demonic child that 's smuggled in as a replacement for a human child , and of course such well-known ones as vampires or succubi . 
  many of them are explained by either archetypical experiences or attempts to understand reality - for instance , the witches ' flight may be explained by dissociative experiences that are commonly induced by nightshade plants used in folk medicine . 
  i do n't have any obscure stories to share because my memory of what my grandfather told me is shaky , but i 'm sure what may appear boringly common knowledge to germans may not be as well-known in other countries . 
  also , there are of course many , many more popular legends ( like the nibelung saga or loreley ) and i could n't begin to write them all down , so feel free to share other german myths and stories as well . 
  - ** the return of barbarossa ** - it is said that the legendary emperor friedrich i. barbarossa , who never returned from his holy crusade , has not died but instead banished himself to a mountain hall under the kyffh\u00e4user . 
  there he sits in a magical sleep on a marble throne , awakening every hundred years to see if the ravens still circle the mountain 's peak . 
  once they are gone , he will return and reunite the reich by reclaiming his throne . 
  - this legend prompted the erection of the kyffh\u00e4user monument , one of germany 's most well-known monuments ; it symbolizes the second reich 's claim to have fulfilled barbarossa 's vision . 
  - ** r\u00fcbezahl ** - r\u00fcbezahl is the mountain spirit of the giant mountains , and there are many tales about him toying with the inhabitants of that region . 
  the best-known story is probably how he gained his name . 
  - the spirit once abducted a princess he fell in love with and made her live in his mountain fortress . 
  she soon became very lonely in her gilded cage , and in an effort to simulate a normal life for her , r\u00fcbezahl gave her magical turnips which could take any shape she desired . 
  the princess conjured up her friends and family and began to accept her fate . 
  but the magical creatures aged tremendously quickly , soon shriveling up and dying as actual turnips would have . 
  the princess was distraught and set the spirit an ultimatum : only if he could tell her how many turnips he had , and thus if she would be able to keep a court , would she marry him . 
  r\u00fcbezahl quickly began to count the turnips , again and again , arriving at a different number each time due to his vast fields . 
  meanwhile , the princess shaped one last turnip she had saved into a magical horse and fled the castle while the spirit was distracted , mocking him as r\u00fcbezahl - `` turnip-counter '' - from afar . 
  * ** st\u00f6rtebeker 's execution ** - the dread pirate st\u00f6rtebeker , who had terrorized the hansa for years , was finally caught and set to be executed along with his crew . 
  as his dying wish , he demanded that every man his beheaded corpse would walk by would be set free . 
  thinking such a feat was impossible , the senate granted his wish - and against all odds , the pirate 's headless corpse rose from the executioner 's block and walked past eleven of his crew . 
  only when the executioner tripped him , he fell ; and out of anger , the same immediately beheaded the eleven men who were supposed to have been saved . 
  the senate was in awe of his endurance and asked the executioner if the day 's work had not tired him , but he assured them that he had enough strength left in him to behead the entire senate as well , robbers as they were . 
  thus , he was executed himself . 
  - ** the earthen pot ** - different from the others , this is a short moral tale and the only one i remember well from my grandfather 's . 
  - an old man had grown feeble with age and was too weak to properly eat his soup . 
  his son and his daughter in law were disgusted by the sight and condemned him to eat by himself , sitting on the ground . 
  distraught by his banishment , the old man grew even more shaky and dropped and shattered his soup bowl . 
  the son became very angry with him and announced that his father would only be given cheap earthen pots from now on . 
  the old man began to cry , which the couple 's little son observed with interest . 
  later that day , the child was seen clumsily cutting away at some boards . 
  `` what are you doing ? 
  '' , his father asked him . 
  `` i am learning to be a carpenter '' , replied the child , `` so that when you are old , you will have wooden troughs that you can not break . '', 
  the man was deeply moved by this comment and invited his father back to the table . 
  oooh , so you spoke about a _ collective _ `` you '' that i must be a part of if i do n't appreciate your methods . 
  well , figures . 
  that 's probably the most absurd lie you could possibly have come up with . 
  absolutely nothing of what you say is true in any way whatsoever . 
  i do n't even get your reason for it , it 's not like anybody except me will read this in a deleted thread . 
  you need to include better directions or people wo n't find it . 
  it 's past all the inquisitive comments and past all the moronic hyperbole by people like yourself , then look for the one that supports the presented narrative . 
  that 's only about a quarter of what they were complaining about , the rest spun off into fantasy territory . 
  ah , i thought you meant outer schengen borders . 
  and as turkey or libya are currently deemed unsafe , that regulation may apply here . 
  it 's against the law , but shall not be punished according to refugee agreements . 
  confirmation bias is a horrible thing , is n't it ? 
  there are basically none of the comments you claim dominate this thread . 
  but if you had to argue based on reality , you could n't dole out the shame by the bucketfull - and then what would become of the world ? 
  they were apparently drunk and this is social housing , not a refugee center . 
  not much else can be deduced with certainty from the police reports . 
  it 's taz , they are known for their `` quality '' journalism . 
  apart from tabloids , they 're probably the worst paper in germany . 
  so nothing to see here , really ...
