  well , if necessary for their protection , then yes of course . 
  i do n't get why people are putting political correctness over safety here ... 
  those are the same people as the ones yelling `` nie wieder deutschland '' or `` bomber harris , do it again '' . 
  generally , there is n't too much logic to their actions . 
  well of course they do n't make up 100 % when i omit those that have below 5 % !, 
  and i never said wikipedia was n't a good source , and i provided the source for the data from which the image is generated . 
  i do n't know what you 're trying to do here ... not once have you shown anything that would allow you to claim that i 'm wrong , you just repeat that over and over again without explaining why . 
  all your complaints so far were due to you misunderstanding the data ( how can you not understand a 5 % cutoff ?! ), 
  but you still remain adamant that i 'm lying or whatever , it does n't make any sense . 
  i _ am _ op , the chart is generated from that list ... and you still fail to point out where or how it 's wrong . 
  please provide some substance or leave me alone , my hangover does n't exactly put me in the mood for this nonsense . 
  by adding 4.01 and 4.43 , which are both below 5 % and thus do n't show up in the above list . 
  sum of both green parties per election : 1991-11-24 10.0 1995-05-21 8.44 1999-06-13 14.29 2003-05-18 5.53 2007-06-10 9.08 2010-06-13 9.18 2014-05-25 8.62 that is how it 's right . 
  what does them being a state broadcaster have to do with anything ? 
  it 's laughable to claim that our poublic stations do n't have a political bias and i 've been hearing this for the first time only after the refugee crisis started . 
  and i 'm pretty sure they are , comparing them to the values found on wikipedia does indicate that . 
  you ca n't just say `` this is wrong '' without even pointing out what exactly makes you claim that . 
  they 're commonly classified as that , yes - just look at wikipedia . 
  it 's weird that people seem to think i 'm making some kind of judgment or implying any implications here ...

  reading wikipedia on such topics is a very bad idea . 
  it 's alright for things where there 's no ideology involved , but they have a _ heavy _ slant on just about anything else . 
  / r/wikiinaction should give an ( also biased ) overview . 
  well , duh , one degree of freedom makes functions underfit in just about any case . 
  that 's why i graphed the actual results as well . 
  the number of people who voted , shown as divided by overall voters in european graphs . 
  this is only the most extreme case my data led me to visualize , and it can be argued that their categorization is accurate if viewed on a historical scale . 
  from my personal impressions at least , such things do n't have a major influence on europe-wide numbers . 
  the classification is made by my source ( www.parlgov.org ) , and according to my impression their judgment is fair . 
  if you have sqlite3 installed , you can see the categorized parties by issuing `` select * from party where family_id = 40 ; '' . 
  source is www.parlgov.org , a site that provides research on democracy . 
  i 'm aware that the categories may be unreliable , but unfortunately , it 's completely impossible to design internationally valid groups . 
  thus , i stayed with ideological ones . 
  if someone can suggest a better grouping , i 'll be glad to change the graph , though !, 
  the `` major '' just denotes my lack of sanity checking - maybe some stats are missing . 
  all countries are weighed by their number of votes anyway , so there 's not much of an influences by places like malta . 
  i did - it 's derived from a database on www.parlgov.org . 
  amazing db , by the way , i 'm sure some of the mods would be interested !, 
  inspired by a recent thread that concentrated on the `` fall of social democracy '' , i made some graphs that illustrate political developments in major european countries since 1990 . 
  ( data before that are crap due to the su . ), 
  i tried using parties ' international signature colors ; but just ask if you do n't understand a graph , it 's not much effort to regenerate one . 
  also note that a party may be categorized differently than you think by my source ; for example , finland 's top two parties are classified as `` agrarian '' when that is only the root those parties developed from . 
  method for graph generation : an approximation linear composite function is developed in the boundaries of known parliamentary elections , weighed by the total populations of voters in a given year . 
  all my data is derived from http://www.parlgov.org/; the source is fairly decent , but just ask if you want more details or if you disagree with a party 's classification . 
  as far as i understood the conditions , those places had insufficient standards and were only good enough to house the otherwise homeless . 
  tne the building shown in the cited report seemed to reflect that . 
  think of it like in a polynomial approximation - in most cases , our political sentiments are very reasonable , but once the parameters get out of whack , so do people 's positions . 
  in contrast , other places have more of a ` linear approximation ' approach to their political spectrum , which is more truthful for single moments but less so for general trends . 
  palmer of t\u00fcbingen recently said the city might consider forcible ( temporary ) seizure of vacant property to house refugees . 
  similarly , ludwigsburg is demolishing social housing to build refugee shelters , displacing the residents into vary much sub-par accommodations . 
  in the end , it does n't really matter if such measures can be fought in court or if there are complex reasons behind them - there 's probably no better way to rile up the people against those who you supposedly protect . 
  ( source is an ard report mainz about the housing situation for refugees . ), 
  -  each housing unit for 30 people costs 300k euro for nieheim . 
  this solution costs nothing . 
  ... is pretty much the perfect representation of the apparent naivety of the policy makers . 
  that approach is so absurd that i would n't use it as a caricature for fear of sounding overly simplistic . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  you have any snow at all ? 
  in germany there is no space between center left and center right , however in other countries there is . 
  but left/right is a harebrained scheme anyway - the fdp is a good example , certainly not center-right in the same way the union is . 
  do you not have a lower limit for things to go on your record ? 
  in germany , you have to do something pretty serious to tarnish it , 90 wage days of fine being the minimum . 
  some fringe parties did n't have a rating but those have basically zero influence on the total results anyway . 
  i was n't sure if i should have rounded the ratings as well , as i said it was just a `` sketch '' i jotted down quickly . 
  as i said , i 'll make some more attempts with the party family instead of simple left-right , that should give a better picture . 
  https://imgur.com/uylyqva red-blue-black left to right . 
  you appear to have no relevant out-of-center parties ( purple and brown ) . 
  hm , i 'm getting different results on a rough try . 
  west : https://imgur.com/iblxbsr east : https://imgur.com/qvunwxw colors are left , center left , center , center right , right as purple , red , blue , black , brown . 
  method - generate an approximation polynomial for each faction in each nation and graph their averages . 
  the difference is probably because i considered left-right instead of party family - in germany , for example , the spd collapsed but the greens ( who are in roughly the same area ) saw corresponding gains , resulting in evening out the trend : https://imgur.com/pc3z1fg i 'll try doing some more graphs considering the party family later . 
  defunct does n't matter , it 's `` at one point '' as i said . 
  but yeah , newer elections seem to be missing , i did n't really check the raw data ... will look for a better source , maybe there 's one that classifies the parties itself . 
  edit : http://www.parlgov.org/ even has an sqlite table with huge amounts of metadata about the parties !, 
  if someone can give me the election results in a parseable format and the political ` category ' of each party , it wo n't be much effort to make such graphs . 
  edit : oh cool , http://www.globalelectionsdatabase.com has global election results as csv . 
  though their party list is somewhat , ahem , [ verbose ] ( http://www.globalelectionsdatabase.com/index.php/codebook/download ) . 
  [ removed ], 
  my , your country must be even more different from ours than you claim . 
  i 've never ever feared ... well , anything in a german city . 
  ( though i 've never lived in frankfurt or berlin . ), 
   in july 2013 , the home office introduced an advertising lorry in london with its billboard saying `` in the uk illegally ? 
  -- go home or face arrest -- text home to 78070 for free advice , and help with travel documents . 
  we can help you return home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention . '', 
  this campaign was criticised from various quarters : vince cable , a prominent minister in the governing coalition , called it `` stupid and offensive '' ; [ 14 ] some on the left said that `` go home '' evoked an old national front slogan . 
  [ 15 ] nigel farage of the uk independence party criticised the campaign as `` nasty '' and suggested that its real message was `` please do n't vote ukip , we 're doing something '' . 
  [ 16 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegal_immigration_in_the_united_kingdom, 
  a little bit of coke is actually perfect for the wiesn - the people are all very open and relaxed , it 's expected that you sit with strangers , there 's folks from all around the world to chat with ... just do n't overdo it . 
   well they started to use it , so if anythin that 's their fault . 
  people concentrate on their use of this specific word due to its history . 
  and criticizing one group 's tactics does n't mean i 'm sympathetic with their opposite - though the right in general at least have the advantage of presenting their idiocy in a straightforward way and without hypocritical claims of moral superiority . 
   how did i do that now ?
