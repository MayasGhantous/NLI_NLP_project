  -    here 's a german word you might want to adopt : l\u00fcgenpresse . 
  unless you 're completely unaware of history , you should know what using that word as a killer argument associates someone with . 
  it 's being used to deride pegida followers exactly _ because _ of its prior use in the third reich . 
   blindly believing their every word is just as stupid as blind disbelief . 
  employing such measures to shame someone into shutting up is pretty much demanding blind belief . 
  erlanger bergkirchweih is famous , herbstfest rosenheim also has a very good reputation . 
  but you 'll probably find the most authentic places in small villages in the lower alps - their festivals are often still big enough to have an interregional draw , but not more than that . 
  dunno , i thought `` mexican '' might be considered racist by now . 
  again with the godwinning ... it 's been clear and completely uncontroversial for decades that the ard _ does _ have a bias , and acknowledging that does n't make you a nazi stereotype like you insinuate . 
  blindly believing their every word is just as stupid as blind disbelief . 
  is this a joke ? 
  that 's only possible in the lowest segment of the job market , and the people there tend to be protective of what they have , especially as many are intra-european migrants themselves . 
  i do n't see illegal employment becoming that much of a problem - them clogging up the deportation system and other bureaucratic structures would likely be a much bigger concern for both monetary reasons and the resulting loss of efficiency . 
   there seems to be a huge misconception that we are these over religious people when i 've never ever heard that . 
  must be quite a localized stereotype . 
  i just know that you 're all liars , beggars , thieves , fraudsters and gypsies in personal union , or at least my macedonian friend tells me so . 
  is that the albanian eagle over the terrorist in the poster with the latino-american standoff ? 
  i 'd be a shitty guardian if i actually saw myself as that . 
  look at the state of this sub ; this is what your `` ethics '' result in . 
  just pointing out the hypocrisy of thinking _ you _ are allowed to do that while the people with the _ wrong _ opinions of course are not . 
  `` it is right to be truthful '' is an axiom for behavior in a debate that i 'm not really willing to discuss in light of that . 
  to even think that you somehow have the license to manipulate others into the `` correct '' position _ requires _ you to feel superior and in possession of some absolute truth , just like any other fanatic . 
  regardless of the paint job , you 're all the same and you are what 's holding humanity back . 
  my perspective is that lying and manipulating people for the `` greater good '' is the worst you can do for the same and usually has absolutely nothing to do with actually achieving that goal and exclusively with making yourself feel superior . 
  that is what i mean . 
  oh come on , even you ca n't mean what you just wrote ... 
  statements that misuse words for emotional impact are n't good enough to wipe my ass with . 
  australia is about as `` pretty fascist '' as hitler was `` pretty socialist '' . 
  oh ffs , not on / r/europe , too ... you ever seen a 15cm wide briefcase ? 
  only salty popcorn in / r/europe . 
   okay , no need to godwin . 
  you already did that when calling australia `` fascist '' ... 
  i 'm not sure about the relative wages once all the differences in price , taxes , insurance etc. 
  are accounted for . 
  if they had in the end `` cost less '' than an australian doctor , then yes , of course i would . 
  but my impression was that the headhunters sought doctors from specific fields which their countries were lacking rather than just trying to save money on wages - i. e. their salary might in the end have been _ higher _ than average . 
  my father is an emergency anesthetist and my mother is a psychiatrist and neurologist , both in very high demand all around the world . 
  there is , they just ca n't be heard through all that yelling . 
  literally 1/70th nazi country , to be exact . 
  you want your fly swatter , raoul ? 
  `` does n't understand '' is synonymous with `` lacks understanding '' ... 
  you created a context of ambiguity by not distinguishing between the two before being asked to do so . 
  you know perfectly well what impression that gives off to readers who are aware of fuzzynutt 's political line and abused that ambiguity deliberately . 
  it 's laughable to call me reacting to that a `` lack of understanding '' . 
  ah , you edited your comment ... 
  i meant the specific comment of mine that was awful enough to warrant grouping me as `` tagged '' , apparently together with someone who considers immigration genocide . 
  must have been a pretty horrible lack of understanding of context if you value the two at the same level . 
  ... what are you trying to tell me ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  are you denying that many people apply a simplistic black and white ingroup-outgroup mentality to the participants of such debates ? 
  i mean , i 'm apparently tagged as `` bad '' . 
  oh cool , what do you have me tagged for ? 
  i want to at least know why i 'm bad . 
  by comparing different news sources and statistics . 
  nobody claimed forming an opinion was easy . 
  you 're the enemy , i. e. a bad person , ergo you ca n't have the same opinion as them , because that would make you a good person . 
  but that 's at least usually consistent with the text - i. e. the editorial policy would be straight-forward : `` we want this impression '' . 
  claiming one thing and showing another is a sign of incompetence in any case ; _ especially _ if what they said is true and the groups did mainly consist of syrians , but also if you want to give someone an inaccurate impression . 
  looks like that shitty site ca n't even get its own editorial policy straight ... why else would they illustrate the article with a picture that directly contradicts the claim that these were mainly syrians ? 
  are they _ baiting _ for angry right-wingers now ? 
  `` the party behind them '' , oh please ... they _ became _ the party behind them because people _ claimed _ they were the party behind them . 
  constantly portraying them as `` reactionary '' drove those exact people into the party and destroyed it . 
  it was handled awfully , of course - but it speaks for itself that as their right wing gained more and more power , the technocrats left in rising numbers . 
  i was able to observe it quite directly as a friend of mine is an economist who joined very early on for the latter reasons and kept me up to date during that group 's downfall . 
  people were saying `` they 're all fascists '' from the beginning , nothing has changed . 
  it just makes the statement appear more convincing if you claim so . 
  it could also be interpreted as simple economics ... but do n't let that inhibit your derision . 
  the word originally refers to wild animals that could be hunted by anyone ( i. e. without committing the crime of poaching ) and has since been transferred to humans . 
  sas has long become a politicized counterjerk . 
  i very much enjoyed it in the beginning when people were simply laughing at the things some americans apparently believe . 
  but as is always the case with such subs , people soon started to adopt a mindset of superiority and the assumption of being in possession of the universal truth that comes with it , which eventually became a counterjerk . 
  `` but mooooom , they started it ! '', 
  if you want to see yourself on the same level as those people you describe - sure , go ahead . 
  at the moment , you definitely are . 
  hey now , he was _ called out _ !, 
  _ publicly _ !, 
  that 's the biggest cannon those folks know - does n't matter that they shoot every cockroach with it , it 's still serious !, 
  afair , 1 post in / r/fatlogic = 100 lashes on bare feet and banishment from the hugbox if there is no _ immediate _ and _ acceptable \\* _ justification . 
  ^ ( * standard of acceptability is subject to rapid , opaque and unpredictable changes . 
  because we say so . ), 
  with the top mod from srs , they 'll ( as usual ) have to come up with a pretty interesting definition of `` bigoted '' to justify their tagline . 
   while it 's true that they usually are more progressive than the average redditor this is the kind of claim that qualifies you as `` fringe '' . 
  you sound like a caricature of yourself , like one out of south park . 
  in fact , huh , they caricature `` liberals '' whose head is so far up their asses they can see the sun again _ exactly _ like that . 
  literally . 
  do watch the whole thing , it 's a great movie . 
  just not suitable for little children . 
  it 's similar to maus or animal farm . 
  and others advocating for more immigration have called your suggestion of `` improving the fiscal situation by reducing labor costs through immigration '' ( great euphemism , btw ! ), 
  a myth as well - a right-wing lie , even . 
  do n't worry , looks like you 'll soon have plenty of friends in the mod team either way . 
   removed - editorialization good to know that translating now counts as ` editorializing ' . 
  you do n't even need to understand dutch to confirm op 's translation ... 
  ... and then we imported it back , because running after you is the `` progressive '' thing to do . 
  that 's why i said _ further _ hold . 
  bitch , you got nothing on people whose parents said `` it 's animated , how bad can it be '' about [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/fakuciq58xu?t=1h13m33s ) . 
  german : https://youtu.be/kqky2hhetk4?t=20m37s do n't listen to the rest , the german voice acting is as horrible as usual ... 
  ah , this tired argument again ... it is perfectly possible to get a rough understanding of a society by reading about it . 
  imagine that - books are actually written for the exact purpose of educating people !, 
  i 'd much rather have some very clearly defined , narrow boundaries that put a limit on free speech than worrying constantly whom i might have offended now .
