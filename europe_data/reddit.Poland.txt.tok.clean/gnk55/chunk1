it 's still pretty relevant, 
  i 'm against it . 
  why should we help ukraine ? 
  it 's economy is on gypsy village levels and they glorify fascists , destroy polish graves and generally spit on us when we wanted to help them . 
  i like how russia has its own national day of getting rekt by poland, 
   zkurvit lel i approve that, 
  i 'd rather take place in central europe, 
   he was a bully in school you convinced me, 
   things are quite a bit more complex than `` ukrainians decided to kill all poles out of the sudden '' . 
  actually you did decided to wipe entire polish/jewish population out of blue . 
  we even send you a diplomat who you 've killed ( before that , you tortured him , naturally ) . 
  by your logic glorifying nazi germany would be okay too , if you justify it by glorying just small amount of people who were against massive genocide of jews . 
  from your ukrainian perspective upa were heroes because they were fighting for ukraine by removing every non ukrainian ethnicity from its country . 
  its a genocide not a heroism . 
  big surprise, 
   amount of victims from polish side is grossly overestimated and polish often dont mention that killings were mutual . 
  and the violence from ukrainians was much more common , widespread and severe . 
  ukrainians are also the only ones who are gloryfying preparators of violence . 
  preparators of akcja wis\u0142a - kbw , along with gen. \u015awierczewski killed by upa are considered to be soviet puppets and supporters of occupants , definitely not heroes . 
  compared to what they did , the one massacre by ak , while undoubtedly worthy of condemnation , seems quite pale in comparison . 
  pretty cool idea , i like it . 
  they are not not friends to the greeks since they greedily tried to take ~ ~ constantinople ~ ~ istanbul for themselves in ww1 and would have spit on greek people if they took it , even though greeks did most of the fighting there in ww1 . 
   greece and russia has old religious ties through orthodox christianity . 
  like ukraine and russia right ? 
  gulag, 
  at least we can appreciate german cars quality by stealing them !, 
  everyone does . 
  nice flair m8, 
  is aggressive expansion so broken in 1.8 ? 
  its just kinda ironic , that 's all . 
  stop overreacting . 
  your username, 
  you would n't believe how communism changed mentality ( in a bad way ) of people , recovering from it will take decades, 
  what occasion ? 
  eu gets literally nothing from ukraine joining it . 
  im fairly positive he said it in joking manner , where do you see him accusing this guy of doing anything bad ? 
  savages . 
  from my country : [ wawel castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wawel_castle ) [ royal warsaw castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_castle,_warsaw ) other countries : [ hungarian parliament building ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_parliament_building ) [ and austrian parliament building ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_parliament_building ) [ notre dame ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/notre_dame_de_paris ) i know . 
  at least west germany was rich and could invest a lot of money into east germany . 
  now compare it to ex soviet sattelites who had no rich western counterpart ... 
  i remember it  btw edit post or nazi mods will get you , you 're not supposed to post that subreddit : <, 
  that 's actually really cool proverb :p the only reason serbs feel russia are friends to them is because they are n't neighbors . 
  such slavic brothers, 
  such democracy , not even athens have anything on this !, 
  [ kult-arahja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp5jvsnjao8 ) cool song about berlin wall and eastern/western block comparison using interesting metaphor , pretty cool lyrics , 
  they should just remove crimea from fifa map, 
  i love these simple quotes from pi\u0142sudski, 
  i fully support hungarian people in this protest , not only because they are our good friends but also ideas like those ca n't succeed or there may be a chance another government will do stupid shit like this and it will spread around . 
  so are poles ( most of the time ) but stephan batory of transylvania was one of best polish kings , maybe we should swap our governments ? 
  you can guess . 
  i 'm just going to leave [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_europe#russia ) here . 
  to be honest i think its more realistic that russia will become biggest prison in the world in upcoming years , you wont need to place fences near russian border , they will do that for you . 
  that 's what im referring to, 
  gib back millions of poles you killed . 
  its really dreadful that russia can go to other country and imprison someone for no reason basically . 
  amazing . 
  or german leader, 
  i live in masuria and i 'm barely on western side :p, 
  i feel sorry for my hungarian brothers ... you do n't deserve this ... 
  you ca n't claim lands based on history ... 
  i do n't think so, 
  well that changes a lot . 
  generally we always had many jews in poland due to tolerance during medieval/commonwealth days, 
  [ came here to post this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1s4hzt1.png ), 
  but god forbid you to insult our country . 
  elaborate please . 
  putler king of yurop, 
  yes . 
  russia will blame everything on us/west and its not something that we have n't seen already . 
  there is also conspiracy theory that usa government is ruled by outer space fascist reptilians - what 's your point ? 
   countries should n't be able to prevent political opponents from coming to power . 
  no one is doing that . 
  its called democracy . 
  its not always that easy , some countries have literally no realistic opposition . 
  of course they they are . 
  they would show your glorious , totally-not-nazi-genocidal-maniacs upa heroes in a bad light . 
  easy when you look at it from ukrainian point of view . 
   oun/upa was n't anti-polish and anti-semitic organization and yet they massacred 100k poles/jews . 
  what a coincidence  people joinned it to protect their land , their way of life from all foes who wanted their territory . 
  by genocide of every non ukrainian ethnicity on their lands . 
  come on even fucking name states their views pretty obviously , organization of ukrainian ** nationalists **, 
  hungarians have interesting historical relations with poles even though were so different from each other . 
  very respectable people and country . 
  elaborate on that . 
  you want to tell me 2ww was fairy tale where communists and fascists lived peacefully next to each other ? 
  i stand with my opinion , politicians like miler should leave politics permanently, 
  as it should be . 
  that 's why we need to support hungarians , so ideas like those wont spread . 
  ukrainians have inferiority complex about being russian , they want to break every cultural/historical tie with russians . 
  i doubt they will become close allies again , at least not in next 5-20 years . 
   what happens when their family drama calms down and they get back to being a family . 
  who is going to be getting fucked with a pineapple then i wonder ? 
  ukraine never left russian sphere of influence , that 's what about the whole today 's conflict is . 
   they are glorified mainly for their fight against russians and communism . 
  of course they will fight communists because they followed other ideology which was fascism . 
  also does fact that they also killed soviets makes it ok to kill 100k poles/jews in ** most brutal ways imaginable ? 
  indeed . 
  but i think it was more painful for hungary because poland at least got lands that we supposed to have 700 years ago . 
  i think he did touch it indeed , but ca n't find context unfortunately . 
  both i guess , russia is eastern european enemy number one and you can form friendship even with devil to ensure that russia does n't gets what it wants .
