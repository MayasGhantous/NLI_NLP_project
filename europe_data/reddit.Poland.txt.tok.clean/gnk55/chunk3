   that is until russians fucked everything up of course . 
  i 'm glad we found common ground , 
  its named after [ jan zamoyski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_zamoyski ) who hired italian engineer to design city architecture inspired by italian renaissance style . 
  amazing city . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilnius#in_poland generally \u017beligowski agreement was a dick move toward lithuanians pretty much destroying our relations after 500 years of shared close relations though i admit it was tough situation and wish we could preserve our friendship . 
  wilno and lw\u00f3w are really painful wound from war times , by the time we annexed it , lithuanians were like 3 % of population there and the city was polish to the core , the only claim lithuania had over it was from decades before that . 
  uncle stalin thought its only fair if we get some clay from germans so we ca n't whine about his terrors across our entire country , my grandfather was born in wilno and he faced deportation to siberia for no reason . 
  so we basically got free german lands for two very important historical polish cities . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do n't see these cities returning to us anytime soon , but we 're really touchy when it comes to this topic and so are lithuanians so i wish we could just move on . 
  lw\u00f3w and wilno for poles is something that 's kosovo for serbs with minor differences . 
  what are they saying ? 
  my bad , thought im responding other guy :(, 
  i still want my kie\u0142basa !, 
  damn because of your name i want some kie\u0142basa now, 
  russia cant into capitalism . 
  waiting for a movie with them : <, 
  jake_87 can not into original jokes : <, 
  stalin was essentially hitler on steroids . 
  [ wawel dragon aka smok wawelski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wawel_dragon ) his statue in krak\u00f3w even breathes fire , really cool thing , 
  i hate bigos ... 
  its popular in poland parts where i live ( near lithuania border ), 
  we have some [ new tanks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl-01 ) too , poland can into space ... in tank ? 
  you sold most of your tanks to us recently . 
  ye , all the economies other than russia lose out economically by joining . 
  hungary and poland such good friends . 
  correct . 
  hell , i even live next to j\u00f3zef bem street . 
  heh , our national hero was helping you in this uprising , such friendship :d, 
  u wot, 
  glorious phoenix . 
  yes , our countries remember worst days of its life . 
  thanks moscow . 
  giv back wilno and lw\u00f3w !, 
  switching capital to london soon, 
  its not [ that bad ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=poland ) we can invade some countries and protect those polish minorities yo . 
  spoiler : it was a joke . 
  that 's polish strategy for 21 century , populate in foreign countries and then do russian trick with protecting oppressed minority . 
  polska you of genius . 
  why ? 
  we had some good run as empire guess , not the first to fall and not the last , but here we are today and that 's all that matters , 
  good for ukraine i guess, 
  never negotiate with terrorists , you just encourage more acts of terror . 
  at least border between kingdom of poland and germany states never changed in hundreds of years , but turns out having prussia ( especially when we had chance to finish them off ) , austria and russia as neighbours is not good for your health . 
  surely its coincidence / s, 
  do it anyway, 
  that 's a cool website, 
  is he a vampire ? 
  born in poland but father was ukrainian/pole ( his parents emigrated to poland and learned polish ) and i had to go to western orthodox church instead of roman , i consider myself pole but i like to honor some ukrainian heritage like music that my father listened to  unfortunately he died when i was 7 but i still remember many ukrainian folk things he admired . 
  this speech was cringe though, 
  where are you from ? 
  our new prime minister tries a bit softer approach but still supports ukraine so it could have been worse , 
  nothing new . 
  users in r/russia are sure that ukraine is controlled by secret nazi government which hates russians with passion . 
  some people living in western countries have comfort in being distant from russia , but we got your back , lithuania , 
  hey , we care about you < 3, 
  you think thats complicated ? 
  take a look at [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_charles_v,_holy_roman_emperor#mediaviewer/file:greater_coat_of_arms_of_charles_i_of_spain,_charles_v_as_holy_roman_emperor_%281530-1556%29.svg ), 
  when he realized polish treasury is pretty poor he came back to sweden , but they exiled him since they were protestants , then he forced conflict between plc and sweden by giving us estonia . 
  what a jerk . 
  well , castles from teutonic knights are n't that bad for tourism . 
  we have auschwitz too !, 
  yes !, 
  :d but vasa was n't so good for poland :(, 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth under house of vasa . 
  another great attraction for tourists excluding auschwitz , welcome to poland !, 
  putin will soon deport russians to other countries , just so he can have a valid casus belli to support oppressed russian minority . 
  we do n't like him either . 
  their chances to do that were pretty slim . 
  nope , they 're just protecting global community of russians , literally bulwark of anti-fascism . 
  do n't worry , that 's russia job , they are guardians of earth when it comes down to fight with nazis/fascists/evil, 
  ivan the terrible was corrupted by western influence , he was pure blooded mongolian . 
  you triggered me , i 'm searching for my father 's hussar pike right as we speak !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  eh , i ca n't tell if you 're sarcastic or not . 
  but my alexander the great heritage !, 
  that 's a little over the line . 
  because we think they are gypsies , its very common mistake in poland because of word association ( romanian = rumun , gypsy = roma ) . 
  funny thing is , there is almost non existent minority of romanian people in poland , yet everyone hates them because they think every single one of them is gypsy :( . 
  i thought that applies to every country . 
  that was before crimea , after it most of poles supported ukraine during the crisis , also most of negativity comes from associating ukraines with russian sterotypes ( drunks , poor etc ) source : myself being half pole/ukrainian :p, 
  [ correct !, 
  yep !, 
  naah, 
  we do, 
  we do n't like russia , 
  lets just hope bolshevick mods do n't find out, 
  hey , you do n't talk about that, 
  yep , they won with nazis just so that they could torment eastern europe by themselves only, 
  lithuania , from historical point of view , 
  nope , he 's just an idiot . 
  i wonder why he 's not banned yet . 
  its widely known fact that russian propaganda is based on lsd, 
  i think its because of stereotype that ukrainians are almost same as russians ( drunks , communists etc ), 
  similar language , both west slavs , why would we possibly hate each other :d, 
  romania you so good frend, 
  i know some ukrainian from my dad, 
  only if you 're muslim, 
  i must admit its cool to read other west slav language as pole, 
  entire vasa dynasty , last jagiellon king and maybe stanis\u0142aw august poniatowski ( we really had huge amount of worthless monarchs thanks to our shitty elective system ) . 
  for xx century up to this modern day it would be general wojciech jaruzelski . 
  lol,
