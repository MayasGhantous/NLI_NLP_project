  in case you have n't noticed , we are in the middle of a huge debt crises caused precisely by unsustainably high government spending . 
  a funny moment to declare the victory of this model . 
  what about ireland , where neo-liberal policies have brought about a historical progress over the last few decades ? 
  what about eastern european countries whose economic transformation has been guided largely by the same ideas ? 
  if france is a success story , then what about the uk ? 
  finally , germany , the current poster-child of economic success , has followed the policy of lower taxes and smaller public sector than the frances and norways of the world . 
  and that 's just in europe . 
  honestly , your portrayal of the situation is just wishful thinking . 
  wow . 
  sad and outrageous . 
  maybe i 'm missing something , but where exactly does it say she was refused an abortion ? 
  iraland obviously allows for abortion when woman 's life is threatened . 
  it seems it could have been an error is medical judgement . 
  the only indication is the quote from the husband , `` how can you let a young woman go to save a baby who will die anyway ? '' . 
  it is n't definitive and it 's the opinion of just one of the sides , not to mention of somebody who is devastated and in no position to think rationally . 
  overall the article is very poor and low on facts , literally 90 % of it is dedicated to describing what a wonderful person the woman was . 
  is there some other source ? 
   privatization does not work through the power of magic . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it works through the power of well-understood and widely agreed-upon principles of economics . 
  economists are unequivocal on the matter . 
   this is not communist mumbo jumbo unfortunately , it is . 
  the same logic could be just as well applied to any other type of goods or services . 
  what makes transportation different ? 
  or do you think government should also be in charge of producing food , which is after all the most basic of goods ? 
  how can we leave something so important and fundamental in charge of those for-profit companies ? 
  when you suggest putting the government in charge of railway , what you are really talking about is denying people freedom . 
  denying entrepreneurs the freedom of enterprise by establishing a legal monopoly , and denying consumers the freedom of choice . 
   the same happened with health care in the us . 
  this analogy is so vague and remote , i could n't even begin to address it . 
  finally , this thread discusses why trains are more expansive than buses and airplanes . 
  bus and airline markets are much more open , privatized , and competitive than railway . 
  yet , somehow , what you take away from it is that trains are expansive because they are too privatized .

  [ i would n't . 
   have n't you mixed that up ? 
  i think lowering labour prices ( wages and social security handouts etc. ), 
  actually lowers internal demand . 
  i meant demand for labour . 
   we have much higher standards of education and infrastructure on a per capita basis and could compete on that level . 
  china/india/brazil will have their own issues , the large amount of poor people will not want to stay that way for long , and neither should they . 
  of course we can also compete by quality and productivity , nobody 's suggesting decreasing wages to the chinese level . 
  however , the current labour costs are evidently too high and need to be reduced somewhat . 
  also , making our labour more competitive is about more than just wages , it 's also about making the labour market more flexible . 
  i 'm not necessarily taking it literally . 
  by using this term you are suggesting the trend will go too far and the final level will be unreasonably low . 
  well , it may be possible , but it is n't automatically implied by the fact that countries are mutually competing right now , as you suggested - that 's a fallacy . 
  sure it 's a fallacy . 
  just because we are currently competing by lowering prices of labour that have been too high and led to reduced demand , does n't imply this will continue until the bottom is reached , as opposed to stopping at a certain level . 
  it 's classic slippery slope . 
  firstly , nice slippery slope fallacy . 
  secondly , the primary issue is europe 's competitiveness compared to the rest of the world , not among itself . 
  fine . 
  so what 's your point ? 
  that because of their history europeans can not speak up about oppression without being hypocrites ? 
  by this logic , i guess nobody should ever be allowed to speak about it , since all countries have had their sins in the past . 
  europe has not followed imperial or colonial policies for about 50 years , how long before a european criticizing oppression stops being hypocritical ? 
  opinions are voiced by individuals . 
  individuals who are not responsible for what their country is doing right now , let alone what it did 100 years ago . 
  also , contrary to what you said , europeans do n't pretend colonialism did n't happen . 
  in fact , colonial guilt is very much present in historical and cultural studies , as well as in politics and public debate - it is actually part of political correctness to such degree that , if anything , it creates the other kind of problems . 
  for instance , a historian suggesting that colonialism may have had any positive effects in subject countries is immediately branded racist . 
  but that 's another discussion . 
  on things that are obvious and that there is not much new to say about , yeah . 
  but this is an interesting , complicated problem and `` shut up , fuck off '' reply just sounds stupid and annoying . 
  usa does try to convince and influence europe ( and vice versa ) on many issues , but i would hardly say they `` dictate '' european policy . 
  either way , we should encourage interesting discussion , rather than useless , empty rants . 
   american politicians can fuck off , hezbollah is a legitimately elected government . 
  which is not necessarily mutually exclusive with engaging in terrorist acts , is it ? 
  * this * is the top comment , seriously ? 
  what the fuck does it contribute the topic ?
