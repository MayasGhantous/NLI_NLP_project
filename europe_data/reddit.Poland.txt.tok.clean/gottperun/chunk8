  yes , i of course understand that problem but that really can not be the fundament for negotiations with another nation . 
  i mean they are blackmailing us because they think it 's us who should be more concerned about they security and the stability in their region ? 
  i do n't understand why we should be more concerned with ultra-fundamentalist talibans taking over they country then they should . 
  the three mentioned make up for more then a third of the circulation in the uk, 
  i do n't know what answer i was expecting lol, 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  can you explain why italy performed so badly ? 
  i mean 1.9 % ? 
  the next one would be greece with 13.5 % which might be just below the avarage ( just guessing ) . . that 's a big gap ... any idea ? 
  yes i got that this statistic op posted is gdp growth + considering inflation ... so what happend in italy compared to the eu15 ? 
  early 2010s were pretty bad years yes : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.kd.zg?end=2014&amp;start=1995&amp;view=chart, 
  for the stupid ppl ... what does `` in real per capita '' mean ? 
  i just used that [ google thing ] ( https://www.google.at/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:ukr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=457740000000&amp;tend=1404424800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) where u can select countries and check how gdp has changed ... italy is doing kinda well there, 
  your graph is useless ... 
  what ? 
  they were just horny shit happens you know ... 
  they will never find the ppl who did this ... imagine a festival with thousands of ppl being inside a big croud ... 
  i still find it hard to believe that was an actual argument in the leave campaign ... i mean i guess the british have been watching tv and reading news for the last few years ... 
  a government that actually cares about its people ... yes that 's what we elected, 
  they should have send that blond girl in there head first . . she was the lightest one you know ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  yeah i get it you are french so looking back at your first comment why would you even comment here ? 
  actually ... sounds like we have a plan now, 
  it 's probably because we are pretty good at adapting , learning languages , also in many countries poles do n't stick together like other groups do . 
  i remember when i was younger i was naive and being proud of my origin i used to tell people that i 'm polish ( i live in austria migrated when i was 13 ) only through the years i learned that in the eyes of others being a pole is nothing to be proud of ... 
  oh so beautifull we do n't have that in poland ... everything is just `` eastern european soviet architecture '' ... 
  this is complicated ... i do n't think the brits do that just cause they feel like it you know ... to be honest i think they coudnt care less ... i do n't understand why they would do this, 
  lol, 
   ( take notes , authoritarians in ee ) ppl in ee sure care ... also you prolly did not realise that the fp\u00d6 candidate resigned on facebook before they even couted all the votes ? 
  leave ee alone seriously fkn hypocrites, 
  great like wow what an achievement ... / s, 
  i do n't understand how people still do n't understand that there is actually no mechanism that will ever work like we europeans would like it to ... screening , fingerprinting ? 
  you have to be kidding there are millions of ppl ready to come to europe for a better life ... most countries in europe can hardly handle their own bureaucracy ... there is no european solution i think it 's just not possible, 
  what should the european leaders have a discussion about ? 
  yes there are many emotions ... great that austrian ppl elected alexander van der bellen as new president this just do n't do anything ... funny how hofer had to admit on facebook that he lost wtf ? 
  but yes thing is what austria always does just move the ball and hope somebody else will fuck it up ... thats is the european idea nowadays i guess just reduce the damage and do n't get involved ... disgusting sry, 
  i 'm curious what word that would be !, 
  please do tell !, 
  is donau really that brown ? 
  i dont think so, 
  wtf does that mean ? 
  i 'm living in austria since 1991 and i still do n't know how to irritate the austrians : /, 
  how exactly is your opinion any relevant to this topic mr. western europe ? 
  for real that song is growing on me i have some esc experience and to be honest i was not listening to many of the songs so maybe i 'm biased but it feels like it can do something this year, 
  he has a point though because if it capsize what u gon na do ? 
  ok sry but i do n't get the joke, 
  it 's spelled like that in german so maybe also in danish ? 
  so what will happen to them ? 
  how are the laws regarding this ? 
  what will the sentence be ? 
  do you have any idea ? 
  makes sense ... even better option : totally ignore every single person in the coutry that is 50 + / s, 
   how many myths the eastern european media tries throw . 
  would you please enlighten me on the myths you 're referring to ? 
   poland is the reverse though , there is no attempt to stop church influence in the state and to promote a society that is n't racist/bigoted/xenophobic , in fact it seems that the government is going in reverse that might be the fact if you are into western madia too much lately . 
  poland is not racist/bigoted/xenophobic any more then other european countries are . 
  the government is not `` promoting '' racism/xenophobia . 
  it 's a very offensive thing to say and simply a lie . 
  the government has a clear standpoint when it comes to accepting eu quotas and thats it . 
  it 's funny how other countries have this too but it seems like the anti pis propaganda is working wonders already . 
  many poles are religious yes and trust the church as it was an institution that did alot for the people during the communist oppresion and many people who are 50 + remember this times very well . 
   its scary how easily people trust politicians , as long as they cater to their fears . 
  these are the same politicians who wanted to deny abortions under any circumstances or , even worse , started the whole polish constitutional court crisis . 
  well did you even read the wikipedia article you linked to ? 
  if yes then how can you say it 's pis alone who started the crisis ? 
  were n't the boston bombers american citizens ? 
  could they have traveled to europe and commit an attack here ? 
  i guess the answer is yes . 
  so how does that justify the fact that it 's easier for them to come here then it is for us to go there ? 
  how sad are this people ... how sad are they lifes ... they have to feel very missplaced and useless ... 
  either that or he was listening to the korwin mike speach and he actually thinks that guy was serious ... well i 'm not even sure he was n't . 
   no right for women rofl, 
  is that a serious question ? 
  i really think this is something this fake slavs are working on ... 
  this guy is actually the president of the us . 
  it 's something i still struggle to believe . 
  beside of polish , broken english , german ( which seems to be a myth ) , and dutch :d actually none ... our pope was way better at this . 
  nice to see european solidarity and everything . 
  i wonder how turkish people who use r/europe feel about this ? 
  in the end they might feel exactly like the erdogan supporters in europe feel . 
  second level citizens who nobody cares about . 
  well yes i agree but we were talking about poland and he asked me about my opinion ... so leave me alone . 
  you 're right it 's not . 
  i was just thinking about other options that not exist so ... 
  if the bridges that were build are unsafe to cross then the question is will we keep them and expect casualities or just burn them down . 
  i kinda want tusk back in poland but to be honest i do n't think the solution to all this mass is a personal one . 
  this will be a grind that will take years . 
   who are afraid tusk is going to come back and take the president 's seat after his european tenure tusk is probably happy he got out of this mess that is polish politics and has a job now that is actually somehow making sense ... also `` they '' pis i guess ? 
  are not petty , spineless cowards but the leading party of your goverment . 
  i did not want to hijack this great post so i now deleted what i posted . 
  also did n't know there is a polonized version ... 
   i am not proud of my language , because if i was speaking german like we did 200 years ago , it would have been way more useful than a language that is spoken among some 20 mil people at best . 
  sorry but that is the most fucked up thing i ' v heard for a long time ... are there more people who feel like this ? 
  have you been baiting some kind of an answer from the beginning ? 
  i now feel kinda stupid that i actually thought you were serious haha yeah what i said is my very honest opinon that is of course subjective . 
  you 're very welcome . 
  yeah i think this are different things . 
  pretty much everybody is proud of history language and culture ( which is probably true for any nation of course ) . 
  but many if not most people are not satisfied with how the country is developing . 
  of course there are people who are satisfied and poland was always looking westwards but there is a big gap . 
  economic growth is nice is the long run but the country is still at construction status at so many levels .
