you really just do n't want to understand what you 're reading . 
  history shows this was a win-win for prussia and the end for poland but back then seemed like a great idea . 
  in my opinion it just looks bad , but hey it is an opinion . 
  hahaha and i was furious with isis fucktards destroying one of humanity 's oldest architectures . 
  seems like we do n't even need fanatical religious retards to do that , because leftist governments are fanatical enough to do the same to beautiful buildings . 
  i wanted to say you are right ... 
  they got their cosmodromes . 
  the guy is right, 
  my problem is that the law is not blind to the criminals origins . 
  the punishment varies depending on who commits the crime against which minority as well . 
  same way people say throwing food at a building is a hate crime , they did n't throw it into their face , it was a silent protest to show they disagree with their culture . 
  you do n't punish anyone to prevent them from taking a step further , that does n't work like that , though believe me i would like to see capital punishment reimplemented to exactly prevent people from taking a step further . 
  as to committing a `` hate crime '' i strongly disagree , while i believe that hateful acts might lead some individuals to commit , lets say , suicide , same punishment for the person guilty of committing said crime should not apply to a general insult thrown at a community that could easily brush it off , but they wo n't , i wonder why ? 
  ( i do n't ) people at communities can comfort each other or protest against being treated disrespectfully , they got many ways of fighting such behavior as throwing food at their sacred building ( hahhahaah i am not a spiritually blind person mind you ) . 
  what happens instead ? 
  a big fat bureaucratic machine is turned on to show this specific community that anyone who is against them is going to be automatically punished and harshly , who else gets such premium treatment ? 
  other minorities do n't . 
  we got a flying spaghetti monster church , why do n't we automatically punish everyone who even starts preparing fucking pasta with one year of prison - it is a registered religion after all . 
  to a fucking slime his shell is a sacred shelter and how many are crushes daily ? 
  why is there no prosecution chasing after these slime murderers ? 
  because alike other minorities slime do n't get premium treatment . 
  throwing food at a building is exactly what happened though . 
  i agree what they did is not acceptable but a year in prison or more is excessive and that 's the least everyone should be worried about . 
  think about all the young and stupid children because children are not thinking about consequences more often than not , if we follow these absurd sentences it might one day end up really badly for children as well . 
  i guess it already might have if people who are probably going to be sentenced had children and needed to work for them . 
  you might say they should have been smarter and wiser but go on and explain why papa is in jail for throwing food at a building, 
  `` desacrated '' hahahhahaha, 
  i really hope you are not serious about this because we could start debating why pedophilia cases could be treated differently depending on where the motivation lies ... 
  depends on what surface chalk is applied to it could case structural damage . 
  i call that feeding . 
  what happened to the freedom to express yourself ? 
  there was this `` event '' of a woman allowing others to touch her genitals in public space , was some square actually . 
  why was n't she arrested , is n't this more offending than throwing food as some mosque ? 
  people throw worse things at churches , no one makes a big deal out of it . 
  one could wonder why things are the way they are . 
  true . 
  ok whatever :d ( i did n't vote for pis but this is amusing ), 
  lie . 
  the new law does n't state anything like that but it might ( might ) make doctors to be afraid to make some prenatal tests other than that i do n't understand why change the law at all ... 
  most people protesting did n't even read the new proposition tho and it makes it kind of funny, 
  aging is not a sickness , at least not in how i understand it . 
  this leads to society extinction unless you automate the breeding system in which case ... 
  i know this might be wrong to say but i think it has a lot to do with men not being manly . 
  take a look at elf societies in many fantasy worlds , they get high tech stuff , premium life , perfumes , make up ... and more often than not they got birth rate problems . 
  i think it is similar in the western world , men want to be beautiful , powerful , successful , little do they care about others and their offspring , they just want to `` improve '' themselves as beings , most dream about being young forever , not realizing what is going to happen with them in a few years . 
  i know this might sound silly but there was held this famous mice experiment and how good living conditions brought deviations and lack of offspring leading to the population dying . 
  you can look it up yourself , but the story goes ... population increases in size with good living conditions up to a point ... after offspring getting accommodated to safety , granted food and water , they become unable to recognize their roles in society , they ( mice males ) become more famine-like , females try to rape male subjects , less and less babies being born , boom end of story , just no explosions . 
  now ... 
  please do n't misunderstand me , i got nothing against people who are homosexual , that is not a problem . 
  problem lies within the matter of our understanding of our goal as species , no one tells young people at young age that they got a really important mission and that failure will lead to extinction . 
  they do not care , bah i do n't care even though i realize it , i am 25 ... we as a system need to change the way we educate young ones , right now we got people telling others they can do whatever they like and that they are free and should be `` successful '' . 
  fuck , we even got people making money out of spilling out crap like motivational speakers or so called `` coaches '' ... 
  i believe that these psychological tricks they are using to mislead people and society could be used for `` greater good '' . 
  and no , this is not ethical or moral , but nothing is today , people think not telling others how to live is right and just , but not telling them about consequences of living in such a free spirited way is not ethical either . 
  it is stupid , arrogant and false , also comes out of fear of influencing young peoples decisions - well to the coaches then , not passing all of your true life experience and observations is just as influencing . 
  kids should be told from young age what will happen to the human societies if certain standards are not met from young age , so they get time to think about the problem and decide if they want to deal with it or just let the society they were born within die . 
  and it is the responsibility of elders and parents to pass that knowledge to their youngsters , if the young care more about themselves than they do about their future offspring then you are in a point where you need an immigration miracle , and we are responsible . 
  i hope so , this needs to be shown to both ukrainians and poles especially those around my age ( 25 ) . 
  an ai replacing the politicians that we presently have . 
  do n't misunderstand i am not some seditious guy who hates the rulling class and i know that it is really simmilar all over the globe . 
  but people who are supposed to be responsible for masses seem to be lacking insight . 
  let 's take poland as example . 
  the current secretary of state ( i think that 's what he 's called ) is allowed to appoint anyone he think is worthy into a position capable of decision-making - lately he appointed a guy into a council of a big company . 
  i am not a fan of the oposition which ruled last 8 years ( the term is inaccurate cause we have the `` new '' goverment for almost a year now ) , they 've done the same things and i am pretty sure this happens at every level of administration , and mostly everywhere not only in poland . 
  people in our democartic systems are corrupted by the very system and its mechanics ( elections and the ways to get votes ) . 
  the requirements to become elected are only established for the people getting elected , but then when they get to power they can do pretty much whatever with it - and in current system there is no good mechanism to controll such behaviour . 
  policies chosen by goverments are not `` readable '' for common citizens , same goes for some law systems . 
  of course they can not be `` crystal clear '' to read , because that could be used by rival states , but then we can not as citizens `` trust and vote '' for our representatives unless we get something like a `` direct gain '' from a certain people getting elected and that leads to corruption . 
  it is a ** never ending ** story to be honest . 
  i think as long as it is in the current system and there is no mechanism that could controll the corruption and phenomena of bending/bypassing the law i can not say i would be able to trust politicians and to let them federalise something like that . 
  if mentioned `` mechanism '' would consist of people it would be something that works above the law and would lead to same results as current system . 
  all that mentioned we have to go back to our imperfect reality and decide to take or to discard the risk of federalisation - with all its benefits and drawbacks . 
  i guess what i am trying to say is the following . 
  as someone who has seen law not executed way too many times , to believe that federalisation will change anything for better during my lifespan ( or even my children if i have any in the future ) is just not possible . 
  it probably would bring good things in the long run , but i would n't be here to experience or even to see it happen . 
  although i would be really glad if someone could make the law simple and not open for too many interpretations across the whole eu . 
  sorry for this wall of text it is just hard to give a proper answer in one sentence . 
  to wrap it up then . 
  i do n't think there 's one thing that would lead me towards supporting the idea , but i would be willing to take the risk if others would honestly want to try that as well - and this can not ever be guaranteed , for we do n't have controll over others ... 
  does that make any sense at all ? 
  if you want to know what i believe then i think people who have the decision-making privilege , *** cough *** , are not in their right minds - they just gamble with others and think it 's all a good game and fun . 
  education systems has been changed at least 3 times ( majorly ) in my country during the last 25 years . 
  not to mention the minor , meaningless changes leading up to production of cheating students who are supposed to become future engineers ( speaking from experience ) . 
  godforbid such people from designing something for an airplane that will have to carry 300 others ... 
  i know it is not the fault of the people in charge , because they are elected from within `` our communities '' ( in each country ) , but damn once they are elected they really could be more responsible . 
  and i am fun at parties , sometimes - cause people think you 're joking when you 're dead serious , 
  why is stream over :(, 
  i do n't like either trump or clinton , but if i were to choose the `` better '' option for eu i 'd take the crazy man . 
  clinton was partially responsible for the spying you mentioned - afaik . 
  that 's not a fair point because sanctions were not followed it was all just talk mostly . 
  also some people talk about it not being possible . 
  how is it possible for the usa or any other country to have `` foreign policy '' , while not everyones interests are the same ... what i mean is that can be said about anything really , even within a family one kid wants one thing the other wants the other - that lies in the human nature and reflects onto the bigger entities like cities , countries and organisms like eu . 
  and while i am strongly against it , it is not impossible to become reality . 
  why am i against it ? 
  because as a mere citizen of a stupid fuck-up democratic/republican country you do n't get to change much about how it works and what it decides to do anyway . 
  eu having more power would mean even less power to actual citizens . 
  and i am against giving up `` freedom '' ( whatever that is ) for false and imaginary feeling of safety . 
  if i was willing to trust my western neighbours and they were worth the trust then i 'd give the `` federalisation '' a second thought but the interests of countries are so strongly diffused that it is not even an open debate right now . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  send me a paycheck for the education received , because i do not volunteer as some of us do , apparently .
