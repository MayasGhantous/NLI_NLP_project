so they asked 40 million poles what they think about euro ? 
  good job !, 
  seriously , those polls make sense only for spreading agendas of either corporations or political parties . 
  cost or compability do not matter man ( though i disagree with everything you said above too ) when it comes to security of our data . 
  if code ca n't be reviewed , then software ca n't be trusted in first place - it 's that simple and there is really nothing to discuss , it 's a fact . 
  i 'm not saying that we all should right now move to open source , from govs to simple citizens , but at least in public infrastructure it should be pursued even if there are issues - for public good . 
  edit : heartbleed happened cause openssl was developed by one underfunded guy and everyone decided to use it anyway and eveywhere . 
  obviously , but it 's something we should pursue , even if it takes years to migrate , it still will benefit everyone ( except microsoft and other corporations  ) . 
   in addition to that , you have to audit every single line of every program used and every alteration to it , i see this being prohibitively difficult and expensive . 
  because you can audit proprietary code right now , right ? 
   in open source you can atleast offload some of the audit work to open source community which is vigilant about vulnerabilities , which would result in lower cost in long run anyway . 
  yes , all should be removed from public it world , however i 'm referring to your comment only , like using adobe products in general . 
  anyway i do n't think adobe products are the issue , rather ms office is and moving to open standards should be prority for every government . 
  you can use adobe products in sandboxed wine environments , though there are open source equivalent which are often considered better , like for example inkscape . 
   if the solutions were better to anyone other than the people coding them , they could have just sold that . 
  and how do you think android was created ? 
  or reddit itself ? 
  do you know who actually pays for linux development ? 
  http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/members do you think those companies would spend a lot of cash on linux development if it was n't benefiting them ( and since it 's open source , also everyone else ) ? 
  open source is not a free piece of crap software , it 's the best possible way our world can evolve - through collaboration . 
  http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source and small , a bit outdated , yet still relevant vid : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvpbfmhoawe edit : btw , desktop interface on linux distributions is easier to grasp than windows these days , your info is outdated . 
  there are open source projects which would be more than happy to accept your money and bring you ( and everyone else aswell ) a lot better solutions than what proprietary tech can . 
  give me an example though . 
  bullshit , for example munich actually saved money on moving to open source solutions ( despite some fud spread by new mayor ) . 
  in long run open source will always bring only benefits and gov infrastructures have to be built with long run in mind . 
  anyway i think that even if the cost was bigger ( it is n't ) , than it should be done anyway just for security sake . 
  the only reason govs are using microsoft or other proprietary software is because such financial decission are made at management levels by people who have no fuckin ' idea , but are persuaded by professional pr/marketing teams of some corporations ( sometimes through legal grey areas , like for example ms bribing gov officials in my country few years ago ) . 
  there should be a rule in it gov/public infrastructure - * if it 's not open source , you ca n't use it * . 
  while open source is not immedietaly secure by itself , it 's first step without which you ca n't talk about security at all . 
  proprietary software can be secure only for those who have access to source code ( it 's developers ) and it 's a threat to anyone else . 
  see ? 
  playing the conspiracy nut card now , well done sheep/agent , 
   obama also dictates exactly what we are allowed to think directly through fox news as well . 
  and if we do n't comply nsa/fbi/cia / atf bashes in our door with special forces soldiers surrounding the house . 
  this could n't be more true , though i think obama is just a pawn in hands of us/israel/saudi arabia inteligence community . 
  anyway , a smart person questions everything and since obviously you are either a us sheep or representative of us propaganda machine ( plenty of both around here ) , i 'm not going to engage in further discussion since it makes no sense . 
  btw , i have nothing against american people , nor russians for that matter . 
  polish , americans , jews , germans , arabs and so on are the same - it 's like two camps , average people in one and governments/corporations in another . 
  first , i did n't chose to request us presence , my gov ( which i did not voted for ) did that . 
  i think us presence in poland is just as wrong as our so called alliance before ' 39 . 
  we live in an illusions of security instead of focusing on our own millitary efforts and alliances with our neighbours ( though there is some progress there , hopefully even more in the future ) . 
  as for us , are you aware that 100 miles from borders there is no constitution ? 
  it 's cause of patriot act or other so called security measures . 
  go look through google or other source for info about it , it was done thanks to two judge rulings last or this year . 
  i will not even mention all that police brutality and militarization we can see happening all over us , just head to liveleaks . 
  you talking about propaganda and censorship ? 
  who is trying to limit the internet by giving power over it to monopolistic corporations with ties to three letter agencies ? 
  who is trying to play the race card all over the media , so your people would fight with each other instead of focusing on problems your gov creates ? 
  fox news and others are just unofficial pr agencies for us gov talking often from exaclty same script provided by gov officials . 
  did you know that 20 years ago there were 50 media corporations in us , today all are combinet into 5 big ass holdings ? 
  oh and voting ? 
  why not use paper anymore , but electronic system which can be easily rigged ? 
  a lot of that stuff is called conspiracy theories , but people already forgot that term was popularized during watergate by nixon administration to diminish bernstein/woodstein and all those who would support them ( and created earlier by cia ) . 
  now everyone who questions us gov is a conspiracy nut , go figure . 
  open your eyes and spend some time researching your own country . 
  i do n't see much difference between us and russia except the range of influence ( or rather bulling ) which for us is global , not regional . 
  i really wish us would just stay away from my part of the world , since everywhere where you show up people die - all in the name of us/israel politics and business . 
  do you mean us ? 
  ** censored **, 
  `` more '' is not covered in financial reports , 
  ** censored **, 
  ** censored **, 
  that 's why us invented isis to have a reason to overthrow assad , right . 
  considering that for last 1000 years ( yes , 1000 years ) we not only survived attacks from all directions , but at some point even built a small empire , then got obliterated by three different countries at once and removed from maps for 123 years ( and resisted all attempts of removing our language and culture aswell ... for 123 years !, 
  ) , then we did reborn just to be invaded again , then after wwii survived another attempt of destroying our culture for 50 years , just to become yet again one of the fastest growing democratic economies in eu ... 
  honestly , after all we 've been through , unless someone kills all 40 million of us , plus another 10 in us and some more around the world - we will not only fight for our nation , but we will make a hell on earth for you if you do fuck with us . 
  we may be assholes for each other at daily basis , but put an enemy in front of us and whole nation unites - we got it in our blood , 
  considering that everyone in middle east is using us equipment and us training , i 'd say iraq army is more advanced , 
  like in ' 39 ? 
  this . 
  i honestly do not imagine all those dota 2 players suddenly becoming stalinist soldiers ... oh wait ... 
  they could ban dota 2 , so at least rest of the community would benefit from it . 
  and kilts became a thing in 16th century , almost 300 years later , 
  you know , after 1000 years of trying to take us a down by like everyone around , people should really learn that we are never going to stand any kind of invasion . 
  we may be assholes to each other , but put a common enemy in front of us and we will become his worst nightmare . 
  i say let putin come , maybe it 's time for poland to get back to moscow . 
  this time we will bring radiators , so we could stay there until they learn to not fuck with us , 
  last time i checked braveheart was one of the most historically inacurate hollywood movies ever made ... 
  but i guess it 's not what this is about , 
   because shouting about conspiracies and treason and russian magical fog for years it was n't shouting , but asking questions po gov did n't want to answer for some odd reason . 
  it 's not about conspiracy theories , but in such important case like death of president , 4 polish army generals and 91 other members of administration even most ridiculous theory should be treated as propable until proven otherwise instead of dismising it alltogether . 
  it 's no different from nixon administration and his pr team calling bernstein and woodward `` conspiracy theorist '' ( term created by said nixon pr team ) . 
  well , president of eu council is just a priviliged and overpaid secretary , he has no real power and ca n't do much harm . 
  though what you 're saying about his role as prime minister is true . 
  honestly ? 
  i 'd rather have us to stay the fuck away from my country , so maybe our politicians would start thinking about making our own military better instead of counting on allies like it was in ' 39 . 
  do n't get me wrong , this is not against us citizens , only against polish - us political relations . 
  touche . 
  nah , bankers would n't let you , they do n't want eu regulations there , 
  yes i am  also i like the part about my cat , upvoting !, 
  i 've made a huge post addressing your comments , but then i glanced at your account history and it looks like you are a pro-american troll of some kind . 
  i 'm done here , enjoy your win , 
  about time , it 's over 700 million of us !, 
  but you contradict yourself by saying we should aid kurds there ... make up your mind . 
  sending troops to middle east , no matter what noble reason you had in mind , is helping us - without any doubt . 
  eu and especially poland should stay the fuck away from middle east , africa , asia or any part of the world and focus on domestic and europe issues , period . 
  what do you mean people like me ? 
  can you use arguments and address my points about us wars or your mind is too limited to comprehend the idea that all fire in middle east is/was/will be started by us and military corporations who benefit from selling arms to all sides of conflicts ? 
  if there was no aid from us to terrorists groups and military regimes , there would be no conflicts ( or at least not so many significant conflicts ) cause you ca n't make a real war by throwing rocks at each other ( not anymore at least ) . 
  us makes hundreds of billions of dollars by selling weapons to middle east countries ( for example - they sell weapons to israel , but also indirectly to hamas who buys weapons from qatar which buys weapons from us and so on ) .
