not sure if joke about belgium or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_martin ), 
   unemployment rate is a misleading stat !, 
  the same can be said about the stats you posted . 
  the definition of poverty can be different in different countries . 
  at least with the unemployement rate it 's simple : you either have a job or you do n't, 
  the pc term is `` person of paella '', 
  he 's the h&m guy, 
  look at them phat ukrainian curves, 
  it seems that it includes migration . 
  look at the suburbanisation in poland, 
  people arguing whether copernicus was polish or german . 
  nobody points out that [ copernicus was a woman ] ( https://vimeo.com/165137856 ), 
  but . . where will the polish women get their abortions then ? 
  why do both of these subreddits use a picture of the famous polish inventor miko\u0142aj tesla\u0144ski ? 
  i am a chair and i find it discriminating . 
  oh no , you did n't, 
  port city, 
  makes sense . 
  the car is lincoln , which are n't sold in europe . 
  i did n't even have them on advanced math in high school . 
  but it was the first thing they taught at the univeristy . 
  child actors . 
  this never ends well . 
  the arabic script and sabres are taken straight from the flag of saudi arabia, 
  romania went full communist , while sweden chose the path of allah, 
  yours looks like the flag of [ latvian ssr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_latvian_soviet_socialist_republic ), 
  it looks like a set of `` alarm f\u00fcr cobra 11 '', 
  you are now banned from / r/beijing, 
  aside from obvious clickbait title , the figures are for a period 55-80 years from now . 
  any predictions for future so distant is no different from fortune telling . 
  and no one will remember this bullshit article by then . 
  i mean other than the capital aglomeration mazowieckie is quite poor . 
  sure they will . 
  nice fear mongering . 
  you 're right . 
  allies dropped the nazi weapons, 
  there 's an area in the baltic sea where nazis dropped thousands of tonnes of mustard gas containers and nobody knows what to do with them or what to do in case they start leaking . 
  former yugoslav republic, 
  also the leaves fall from the trees one month earlier as well ( which is surprising given the difference in climate ) : listopad is polish for november but croatian for october . 
  ah yes , the sickle month, 
  good bot, 
  who needs guns when you have all those wwii explosives lying under ground ? 
  bad news for people with wilno and lw\u00f3w allergies, 
  til that due to eu regulations , eu * households * are about * 69 * times less likely to contain * guns * such as * ar-15 * than american * household * . 
  `` b-but that was n't * real * communism '', 
  most read newspaper = absolute garbage tabloid that rule applies to any country . 
  and how exactly your comment helps fight islamophobia ? 
  you see , i do n't even agree with the guy but from my perspective you seem to have a victim complex . 
  people have different views just get over it . 
  do n't get heated over something that some guy have written on the internet . 
  yes . 
  it 's exactly the same thing . 
  a genocide and an internet discussion ... 
  your comment was basically an `` i do n't agree with you '' rephrased . 
  it adds nothing to the discussion , you did n't provide any counter-argument . 
  maybe you tought that it 's self-explanatory , but it clearly is n't when 50 + people agreed with the other guy . 
  you could 've just downvote the guy or ignore him . 
  there 's your answer, 
  this . 
  the `` why does this have x upvotes ? '', 
  comments always get downvoted and for good reason . 
   there they can claim their right to legally apply for asylum and trained eu officials can determine if their request is valid or not . 
  if they are declined the asylum then what ? 
  because currently the authorities ca n't send those people back , so they stay in europe either way . 
  your solution does n't solve much . 
  i do n't think that it even solves the traffickers problem as there would still be many people that would prefer to cross the sea illegaly ( lack of documents , criminal record ) . 
  i do n't think it matters . 
  the pictures are just for the general public . 
  if there were taken by the authorieties that means that they were n't there by accident ( i mean it 's the middle of a sea , what are the chances ? ), 
  but there was some kind of investigation . 
  it says `` polizia di stato '' and `` guardia costiera '' on the picture . 
  i assume the pictures were taken by the police or the coast guard . 
  lol `` hooligans '', 
  baltic sea - the water is always so cold it crushes your ankles, 
  i suppose it 's good enough of a proof to arrest them , right ? 
  we just need to build something nice on that huge parking lot in front of pkin and it will be bearable ( and get rid of patelnia , i hate it ), 
  why would they do that ? 
  * who lives in a windmill under the sea ? 
  * * ne-der-lan-der * * who wears wooden clogs and always smokes weed ? 
  * * ne-der-lan-der * * if mountain is something that fills you with fear * * ne-der-lan-der * * just pack your caravan and tow it in here * * ne-der-lan-der *, 
  military shops , maybe shops with garden equipement, 
   how do you unlock that atc tower though ? 
  communism, 
  bot , are you dru ... ^ ^ nevermind, 
  he allied with ussr and then invaded them , so yes . 
  the old frugo ads were the 90 's at it 's finest, 
  no , this stupid tax is only for public broadcasters ( tvp and polskie radio ), 
  great . 
  now i want to play some c&c generals, 
  for anyone wondering : he 's the one in the middle, 
  [ wait , it * is n't * a dessert ? 
  how does she eat the chips if she holds the coffee in the other hand ? 
  does she raise them to her mouth and eat straight from the cone like some kind of animal ? 
  poland larp into space, 
  it 's obviously not `` per capita '' but what order of magnitude do these numbers represent ? 
  per 100,000 ? 
  per million ? 
  `` pizza planet '' . 
  nice . 
  in the lower right corner of the picture you can see a gda\u0144sk dog .
