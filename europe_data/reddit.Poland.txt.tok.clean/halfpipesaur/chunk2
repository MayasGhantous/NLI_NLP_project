  a gdog . 
  this does n't help, 
   vogelbekdier vogel-bek-dier -  bird-beak ( ? 
  ) - animal i love these no-nonsense compound words, 
  the rest is people that post pepe the frog memes on facebook, 
  mission passed !, 
  respect +, 
  they should change the road number that leads there from 216 to 666 ( currently unused ), 
  estonia ca n't be nordic it was mediterranean the whole time, 
  also true for polish z\u0142oty . 
  ^ ^ ^ well , ^ ^ ^ obviously ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ would ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ 888.88 z\u0142 ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ 888.88 $ i wonder if this 0.01-0 .02 -0.05 - ... 500 system is the most popular in the world .

  beacause it 's sugar-free only biterness,

  yes , some time ago i read about this whole category of coats of arms that feature symbols which names sounds similar to the name of the city or family . 
  they loved their puns even centuries ago . 
  edit : [ they are called `` canting arms '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canting_arms ), 
  - guys , we need a flag for our capital . 
  any sugestions ? 
  - how about a bear ? 
  * bear * - lin . 
  get it ? 
  - mein gott , that 's the best idea i 've ever heard - more like the * bear * - st. . . - get out !, 
  looks like a flag of an african country, 
  there 's no way that swedish trains are worse than pkp  high-speed trains oh , that explains it . 
  you ca n't have the worst high-speed trains if you do n't have high speed trains . 
  greater poland is smaller than the actual poland, 
  the rare yaris harlequin, 
  i watched this dw segment but still do n't know what this ` sun tax ' is . 
  what exatly is taxed ? 
  solar panels themselves , production , sale of energy ? 
   `` discussion '' means there are two sides with their own facts . 
  in that matter only one side has facts , therefore it can not be a discussion . 
  that 's not what a discussion is . 
  discussion is an exchange of arguments and i say that anti-vaxxers arguments are terrible : based on a false study ( `` vaccines cause autism '' ) or on poor knowledge of chemistry ( `` vaccines contain compounds of mercury '' ) but the `` parents do n't know much about vaccines '' is pretty valid , and if we will to discuss that topic with the people that want to listen , then the `` discussion '' is a good thing . 
  discussion \u2260 denial you can discuss evolution or climate change and it does n't make you a tin-foil hat wearing crazy person . 
  science of such complex problems is never decided . 
  that 's why there are thousands of actual scientists that are still studying those topics . 
  as for vaccines , i believe that there will always be a group of irredeemable anti-vaxers , but maybe more knowledge of this topic ( aquired through discussion ) would stop them from getting endorsement among confused parents . 
  i 've been calling them ` tramwaj ' all my life . 
  i do n't even know their proper name . 
  do ladybugs even live in iceland ? 
  probably the numbers are skewed by americans that are `` 1/279 irish '', 
  for some reason that 's the only source in english that i could find . 
  the two that voted against are zbigniew ziobro ( minister of justice ) and beata kempa ( minister , head of the chancellery of the prime minister ), 
   i will teach my children to drink your blood and eat your body every sunday ew !, 
  nice logic right there, 
  what about the prices in pubs ? 
  i heard that beer in locals in czechia is cheaper than in poland ( where you basically have to pay triple for a beer just because someone pours it for you into a glass ), 
   `` hl '' what ? 
  '' \u0141 '' sounds like `` w '' in `` win '', 
  wood chips as an alternative ? 
  i do n't think that 's much cleaner than oil or ( especially ) natural gas . 
  ` su ' is even worse . 
  it was a code for soviet union, 
  albania should n't have changed their design . 
  black eagle on red background looked badass ( not to mention that it 's the actual colour scheme of their flag , unlike the new design ), 
  that 's not true . 
  the flag was replaced by the stars in 2006 . 
  we can shut down this `` tracks of europe '' fad . 
  nothing beats n\u00fcrburgring, 
  that seems pretty basic . 
  back in my day we had yo-yos . 
  we could make sick tricks and occasionally hit ourselves in the forhead . 
  fun . 
  so what 's with this toy ? 
  it looks like a piece of plastic with a bearing, 
  the only american food available on daily basis that i can think of are californian wines and some unprocessed nuts . 
  i do n't really know what you can get in the imported food section because it seems to be crazy expensive ( i once paid 7z\u0142 for a can of cherry dr pepper , while a localy produced regular one cost 2z\u0142 or under ), 
  it 's a museum of contemporary art 's temporary building . 
  which probably means that we are stuck with this ugly piece of shit forever . 
   western european cultures already had muslim influence way before the attacks began . 
  go to london , there are almost more non-brits than brits , and it has been like that since way before isis existed . 
  also , not necessarily are those from outside who become terrorists , but many are already inside and have a eu passport . 
  what kind of argument is that ? 
  `` it 's cool because the terrorist are n't the migrants but they lived there for years '' . 
  poland does n't have sizeable middle-eastern muslim minority yet and can learn on the western europe mistakes and take some steps to prevent creation of muslim ghettos and radicalisation of the second generation immigrants . 
  steps like not letting in a group of illegal immigrants from god knows where . 
   why does poland not get attacked ? 
  because of their immigration policy ? 
  of course not . 
  the policy does n't prevent a terrorist from catching a morning train in berlin and blowing himself up in warsaw in the afternoon . 
   maybe , but italy or greece do n't have that kind of immigration policy and they havent been attacked . 
  they also do n't have big middle-eastern ghettos  are the attacks related to the number of immigrants ? 
  arguably . 
  i agree . 
  at least not as much as everyone ( on both sides ) wants these two issues to be related . 
   my theory is that an attack in italy would n't have the same impact as an attack in london , paris , berlin , brussels ( eu headquarters ) ... really ? 
  in italy there 's a top tourist destination on every corner . 
   finally , what is the alternative ? 
  what do we do with the migrants incoming ? 
  we can start with diferentiating between legal muslim migrants , illegal migrants and refugees  do you just close the eu completely ? 
  for the illegals ? 
  yes . 
   are we willing to build a wall after laughing so much at trump ? 
  not a bad idea . 
  ask the hungarians edit : also , i forgot to add that the public tv is heavilly controlled by the ruling party . 
  some of their reportages are painful to watch with so much agenda-pushing . 
   celebrate their death that 's an unfortunate choice of words .
