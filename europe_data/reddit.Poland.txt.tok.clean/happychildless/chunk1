  it 's a fictional country populated by [ furry black-and-white humanoid creatures ] ( http://images.luscious.net/2/ommta_843404734.jpg ) . 
  [ nsfw ], 
  [ blacks in usa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/new_2000_black_percent.gif ) . 
  [ you would think that acceptance in south america is higher . 
  ] ( http://www.pornmd.com/sex-search ), 
  [ black population ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/new_2000_black_percent.gif ) and `` straight ( gay ) ' is already explained . 
  simple , straight men having sex with men . 
  buerette is a ( north ) african woman living in europe , like [ lou charmele ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/lou_charmelle ) for example . 
  `` tuga '' is a portugese person . 
  i 'm guessing that `` raincoat '' is `` condom '' , but i 'm afraid to check . 
  kenya has `` false vagina ( gay ) '' , maybe this is the same . 
  i have some experience with moderation , so here i go : i visit redditabout 20 times in an average week . 
  i visit / r/europe daily . 
  i 'm hailing to you from poland . 
  i do n't speak any languages besides german and russian , sorry . 
  i 'm interested in european oral sex . 
  i like analytical approach to european politics . 
  i do n't like how status quo is treated like some kind of supreme good . 
  i wa n't to be a moderator , so i can post oral sex and ban everyone who complain about it . 
  i handled my role at / r/happychildless very well . 
  i do n't have expirence with bots or expirence with datamining . 
  the megathread was a swell idea . 
  currently the sub is overflowing with immigration posts . 
  i can not give people hugs over internet connection . 
  fighting little horses is preferable . 
  especially when i could take some of them home . 
  europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  i do n't know , maybe music . 
  music ties variety of random words together . 
  then polish government is going to include : repatriated poles , asylum seekers , emigrating ukrainians and predict 250 thousands of `` refugees taken in '' in poland in 2015 . 
  once you abandon the common definition there is no boundaries to nonsense . 
   the predictions come directly from our government not really . 
  i can guess what you mistaken for a number of refugee status granted , but give me a citation , so you can read it for yourself . 
  we expect next german chancellor to be two-headed goat . 
  i can make ridiculous predictions too . 
  germany granted refugee status to 37 640 in 2014 . 
  265 refugees in 2014 ; it is still increase from 200 in 2013 [ . 
  [ not a single one ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/ukraincy-u-nas-azylu-nie-znajda-3295333.html ) . 
  poland is peculiar , i remember a case when foundation sponsored cochlear implant for a little syrian girl ... and state managed to deport her before the operation , hilarious . 
  polish government at the beginning of 2014 `` was ready for 10 000 ukrainian refugees '' , 2000 applied for an asylum , all of them were denied . 
  volume of ford transit is higher than volume of 50 people , but i wanted to see the photo . 
   refugees travelling under the geneva convention the directive deliberately fails to mention what does it means . 
  it 's not like airlines can recognize or interpret un conventions . 
  re-read it . 
  not only member states refuse to allow visas for asylum seekers , but hilariously try to shift the blame on transportation companies , simultaneously threatening them with punishment for doing this . 
  irl , it is probably less financial risk to move people from lebanon to uk in a refrigerator truck than in passenger airliner , and austrian ( and other eu ) governments are responsible , not airline companies . 
   every asylum seeker can , per eu directive , board a plane and fly to country xy . 
  read the directive instead listening to me , but it is forbidden there . 
   however , if that person gets denied the airline has to pay for the cost of transport back to the country of origin and a fine on top of that . 
  oh , so you understand . 
  airlines do n't violate anything , reread it . 
  once the immigrants were granted visas they could fly in , but as it is they ca n't . 
  blaming airlines either way is hilarious , because member states decided the rules and they are responsible . 
  interesting , does this proposition have any chance of implementation ? 
  visa for asylum seeker would provide immigrants with safe passage , via air flight . 
  well , as long as it is eu wide . 
   50 people in a ford transit show me !, 
   probably study some hip major at a university in a big city . 
  xenophobia among university professors and phds in poland is high , imo . 
  i usually do n't criticize systematic abuse of foreigners in poland , because most polish people are n't even interested . 
  you could rebuild multi-ethnic society in poland with relatively little effort . 
  it 's not like abuse of foreign workers is just against rules , it 's also bad for society . 
  it 's ancient and enduring element of local cuisine , something which preceded arrival of potatoes and tastes good . 
  it 's generic i must admit .
