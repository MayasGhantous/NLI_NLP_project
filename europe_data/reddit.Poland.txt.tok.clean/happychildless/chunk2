  in my mind cider is going to be always associated with [ 90s in poland ] ( https://youtu.be/ktlekcxpd6q?t=510 ) , not with communist period .

  i like the promotional video of gdynia , mostly straightforward thing you can see yourself . 
  their american football fans are surprisingly nice , unlike arka 's . 
   i do n't think anything major will happen/change , really . 
  / u/luxzaal  i 'm going to venture a guess that close to no impact . 
  for 1,5 years new gov will be going through papers left by current gov in order to highlight the corruption . 
  i 'm only half joking . 
  / u/sigmasc  do n't expect any impact  / u/the _ naturalist  we will have fascist dictatorship and will start to exterminate all jews and foreigners .

  why would you expect kaczy\u0144ski to be sane ? 
  he was speaking about shariah in sweden and muslims shitting in italian churches . 
  it was po which removed draft and poles `` were disappointed '' as you say , what do you expect to happen ? 
   this would end their rule in massive protests and early elections . 
  protests by who ? 
  people who do n't remember what life was like in 2007 ? 
  well , according to polls majority goes to party which proposed invigilation agent in every internet cafe . 
   funny enough relatively high score by po in expense of other parties ( they try to rally voters to vote for them in order to not let pis win ) would make pis majority more likely that 's false . 
  [ you keep using that word ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2y8sx4b2sk ) . 
  that 's correct , but this leaves poles in poland unable to rebut false accusation or selective perspective . 
  uncle pedo , do you wa n't to tell us something polish authorities may be interested in ? 
  poland had one of strangest parliamentary elections ever , in 1991 . 
  seats were awarded by proportional representation using largest remainder ( hare-niemeyer ) counting method with no electoral threshold and only 5k signatures suficient to establish an electoral committee . 
  translation for idiots - barking mad . 
  in result voters had 934 lists of candidates to chose from and some of elects managed to forgot they were even candidates in the first place . 
  the parliament started with 29 parties , but they keep dividing , so some day beer lovers party was forth largest force in polish parliament . 
  among winners were two peasant parties , of which more important entered under the banner `` bring peasants to wiejska * ( village ) street '' , another with slogan `` theft of national wealth '' , and finally [ party x ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbbx6aezez8 ) without any programme whatsoever . 
  * the parliament building happens to be on wiejska street . 
  * that 's awkward . 
  * poles are n't allowed to discuss candidates/elections till voting ends .

  resolution shortening the term of parliament , 7th september 2007 . 
  mechanical translation :  for two years , since taking power by the law and justice , polish shaken by the growing political crises that have their source in the quality of the ruling coalition and philosophies of its government . 
  not a month goes to the public - not just national but also european and world - not learned about incompetence , scandals and corruption , whose origins lie in a ruling . 
   yesterday , ie . 
  9 july 2007 . 
  - on suspicion of corruption , was dismissed deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture . 
  they also had to dismiss the minister of sport , in connection with the corruption of his subordinates . 
  the day before yesterday we were all witnesses of the scandal , which sparked religious thorn - o. tadeusz rydzyk , insulting the head of state . 
  his media are a kind of confessional for the polish prime minister and ministers , and he - kind of guru for the ruling parties . 
  there is met with no response the first people in the country . 
   not so long ago the parliamentary committee has become a place next discredit the foreign minister , who - which has not happened ever - refused to members about the outcome of the eu summit . 
  the meeting of prime ministers of the eu in brussels supplied - and polish , and international - public , evidence of the incompetence of the polish authorities and the false notion of national interest . 
  polish authority issued undermine and discredit . 
  this is not the only example of foreign policy actions that bring harm and discredit poland . 
  almost a year ago the parliament became a place of unparalleled political corruption , disclosed by the media , which did not meet with any political consequences or penalties . 
   these are just a few of the many examples of moral and political downfall of the government . 
  you worrying loses its ability to solve social problems . 
   for many weeks it takes a heavy crisis in health care , which results in protests by doctors and nurses . 
  is spoiling the education system . 
  the state became repressive and hostile to its citizens .
