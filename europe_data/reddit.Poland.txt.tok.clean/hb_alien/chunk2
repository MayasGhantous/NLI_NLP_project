  it 's definitely a national embarrassment . 
   but if you see someone who is n't from india sporting a swastika today do you think `` aww !, 
  he must really appreciate hindu culture '' ? 
  that really depends on how they 're wearing it . 
   the `` roman salute '' thing is a myth . 
  it was retconned into history by 19th century nationalists and romantics . 
  it still came into being before the nazis adopted it . 
   well if nothing else this will ensure that it 'll never happen again it 's not like he raped anyone . 
  he raised his arm . 
  god forbid anyone ever raises their arm in celebration again ? 
  franks * . 
   in fact the einsatzgruppen killed more jews than the concentration camps did . 
  is that a fact ? 
  i thought the were responsible for about a milion of the deaths . 
  says the romanian * jk *, 
  good for greece to be prepared . 
  you never know when the ottoman empire will rear it 's ugly head again . 
  can i has silesian flair ? 
  successful * ? 
  dude ... does this really belong here ? 
   the casualties of conflicts involving the u.s. , the uk and france in korea , algeria , vietnam , the gulf , afghanistan and iraq are excluded on the grounds that , though many would view these as unjust colonial wars by ` imperialist ' powers , they were n't fought by dictators . 
  lol , fuck off daily mail . 
  i can buy $ 3.75 for the sandwich itself , but not for the combo with drink and fries . 
  that usually goes for over $ 6 . 
  post this in / r/unitedkingdom , we do n't care . 
  she 's already sick of these little brats .

  so you can fully admire your hard work after you 've finished . 
  just in time for the centennial of the rise of fascism and bolshevism . 
  not sure if worse , but it will probably continue at this pace for a while . 
  neither syria nor libya look like they will be stable any time soon . 
  central africe is n't stable either . 
  because of the massive flood of migrants coming through turkey and libya . 
  speak for yourself buddy, 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  what is the reason for the electronics in german ids ? 
  what the fuck is that ?

  of course they * can * be . 
  do you know what / r/coontown is , by any chance ? 
  right , except they spend the rest of their time in / r/european and / r/coontown , unlike the rest of us . 
  all i 'm saying is that elements of those particular subs are present in / r/europe . 
  edit : i 'm also not saying that everyone who has a strong opinion about immigration is a coontown racist . 
  i myself have reservations about letting in every person who shows up at europe 's doorstep . 
  they do n't link here from their subs . 
  they just lurk and pounce on any topic they can latch onto , or submit their own inflammatory links . 
  example : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3eshol/lithuania_and_nazis_the_country_wants_to_forget/, 
  i think the controversial tag is more about the comment threads , rather than the actual articles . 
  it 's a very small , very loud minority that includes moderators of large subs . 
  i mean , did you read it ? 
  it 's a crap opinion piece that 's pretty light on the details , as is all of alternet 's junk `` journalism '' . 
  the first half of the article has nothing to do with greece , and the rest is sensationalist garbage . 
  surely you can find a better source . 
  yeah , please do n't post alternet here . 
  it 's garbage .

  no , i know what a row is in this case . 
   the shooting may have been sparked by a row over a clothes line . 
  what now ? 
  did n't everyone outside of malaysia airlines know the danger of flying over a war zone ? 
  the baltics have 3 tanks combined ? 
  and no air power ?

  imagine hours and hours of flying with the crew trying to get into the cockpit . 
  thanks,

  it 's a low quality weekly tv drama . 
  nobody cares and nobody should remember this 48 hours after it airs . 
  national review is a very biased right-wing publication . 
  i 'm not sure if this is even worth reading . 
   the 6-kilogramme ( 13-pound ) boy was born at berlin 's charit\u00e9 hospital to a 40-year-old , 240-kilogramme ( 528-pound ) woman she was already ruined .

  just how bad of a shithole is it ? 
   svartenbrandt was born in grytn\u00e4s in avesta in 1945 .

  [ amazon ] ( http://www.amazon.com ) as in the giant online retailer . 
  they have a netflix-like video service with original shows , which will soon be showing the new `` not-top gear '' show .

  uhh , wtf happened there ? 
  i 'm super allergic to our national flower : ` (, 
  that 's the name of a hotel . 
  there was no water scandal . 
  i will never upvote an article that uses `` gate '' in reference to some kind of scandal .
