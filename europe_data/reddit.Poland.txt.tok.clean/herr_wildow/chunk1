this is epic !, 
  til portuguese air force is called fap , 
  one positive that came out of living in constant lack of everything was that people used to repair stuff . 
  you only threw something away if it was beyond repair . 
  even then - you first made sure that you ca n't do something useful with your broken stuff , like make your broken kitchen table into a dog kennel or sth . 
  nowadays if something breaks you throw it away and buy new . 
  also - people used to knit their own clothes - scarves , sweaters , etc , mend their socks and patch torn trousers . 
  it was kind of cool  few people do it anymore, 
  yeah , my parents told me they once took turns standing in queue for a few days to buy furniture . 
  only way to get it . 
  very accurate representation of how confident i feel about nato commitments . 
  we have a saying in poland - if you can count , count on yourself, 
  i sure hope you meant ` formerly ', 
  hey !, 
  i 'm fixing this sink , find yourself some other job to steal from brits, 
  eu should warn them and if this does n't work - warn them again !, 
  whoa !, 
  that was ... rude, 
  well actually not 5-inf , but 5-21 cent\u00f3w , 22-24 centy , 25-31 cent\u00f3w , etc. . . polish rules !, 
  i use `` er\u0142o '', 
  also : we 've caught some russian spies and the counterintelligence while searching their apartments found a list of potential targets to convert . 
  list has not been disclosed to public but is said to contain names of some well known politicians and journalists . 
  ca n't recall but would n't be surprised , knowing our courts and politicians edit : so i actually got interested and worked some google magic to find this case , what you probably mean is the case of [ akhmet zakayev ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akhmed_zakayev ) from chechenya . 
  i remember now that it was quite a widely discussed topic in pl at that time ( 2010 ) . 
  he was actually arrested but released by court : `` in 2010 , he was arrested in poland by police upon arrival for participating in a conference of chechens . 
  he was later released when the judge ruled that he could not be held due to his political asylum status in the uk . 
  he has since returned to the uk . '', 
  funny - i now learned this happened when he was on his way to a meeting in my small hometown of pu\u0142tusk , 
  good guy bulgaria ... pat , pat ... 
  [ longest market square ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pu%c5%82tusk ) in europe, 
  also : `` but russians liberated you from the nazis , did n't they ? '', 
  do n't blame us , it was hungary !, 
  eu will warn this country . 
  and if it does n't work , eu will warn this country again . 
  are we ... 
  pools ? 
  yeah , it 's useful to know this fact . 
  when i was a kid my mom used to be constantly pissed off with dresiarze sitting in front of out block of flats and littering / acting obnoxious , so she got all neighbours to sign a petition to ... remove the bench from that spot . 
  they disappeared on the same day as the bench . 
  this was not explained in the press conference . 
  my personal theory is that they put the train in some tunnel and collapsed the entrance or the whole tunnel . 
  i think it would be the only way to do something like that without the whole neighborhood knowing . 
  the nazis left the country in rubbles so nobody would notice another destroyed structure . 
  the officials said that if rightful owners of whatever is inside can be found - it will be returned . 
  at this point though they have no idea what 's inside . 
  it probably looks similar to [ this one ] ( http://www.sppw1944.org/powstanie/wola/p27.jpg ), 
  sorry , it is such a big news here at home , that i kinda assumed everyone knows about it  [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/nazi-gold-train-poland-asks-treasure-hunters-stop-search ) is a guardian article about it . 
  it 's a panzer train from ww2 containing god knows what but everyone thinks that there 's nazi gold and/or works of art stolen by nazis during ww2 . 
  what we know so far : - location of the train is known - there are georadar pictures of it ( not disclosed to public so far ) - it is an armored train complete with guns - location was disclosed on deathbed by one ( last ? ), 
  of the people who helped hide it - according to this person the train is rigged with explosives edit : the train is reported to be 100m long edit 2 : [ first source ] ( http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,18644777,ministerstwo-kultury-osoba-ktora-brala-udzial-w-jego-ukryciu.html ), 
  did you guys just ninja-annex krak\u00f3w ? 
  poor guy , i hear there are no good playstation games in norwegian prisons .

  you do n't need to bother with your reply - i 've read your recent post history and i think i can figure out what your reply will be quite well . 
  blabla - upa , blabla - bandera , blabla - they 're taking our jerbs , blabla - `` sex ed is pedophilia '' ( quote ) , blabla - `` poland for poles '' , `` i 'm intelectually superior to you '' ( another quote ), 
  first of all - unemployment is not huge . 
  it 's fairly high but is steadily going down . 
  10 % according to gus , 8 % according to eurostat . 
  some jobs ca n't be covered with local labor due to lack of specialists ( either emigrated or not enough ppl educated in certain fields ) the link you posted does not represent in any way the majority of ukrainians and their attitude towards poles - someone posted today a poll among ukrainians and it shows we are the most liked nation among ukrainians ( thanks guys ! ) . 
  the upa issue is definitely a thorn in our relations , let 's not forget though that we also did some bad things to our ukrainian brothers over the course of history . 
  there are similar kinds of idiots in poland . 
  judging by your history of posts and recent ban from / r/poland - you might just be one of them . 
  i do n't think anyone really fears ukrainian refugees . 
  i mean - i 'm sure anyone here would choose ukrainian refugees over african/middle eastern ones because of all the things you mentioned . 
  many skilled people left to work in the uk or germany , so there is a certain gap to be filled by those willing to work . 
  ok , i 'll bite this poorly veiled bait . 
  yes , football is extremely popular in poland , it 's the number 1 sport to most poles . 
  we have a history of success with our national team - in the 70s-80s we had one of the world 's best teams ( twice came third in world cup - 1974 and 1982 ; gold medal in the 1972 olympic + twice silver 1976 and 1992 ) the team has been suffering crisis over the last two decades but there are signs of revival ( jumped 45 places in fifa ranking over last 2 years ) the league ( ekstraklasa ) is far from european elite , the chief reason being ( in my opinion ) money , we do n't have super rich clubs . 
  our best players play in foreign leagues . 
  i find your statement about lack of good footballers false . 
  we 're known for our goalies , just to mention recently retired dudek ( liverpool , real madrid ) , szcz\u0119sny , boruc , tyto\u0144 . 
  every football fan in the world knows robert lewandowski ( bayern munich ) . 
  grzegorz krychowiak just won the european league with sevilla . 
  \u0141ukasz piszczek was considered one of the best right defenders before his surgery . 
  arek milik is a rising star in ajax amsterdam . 
  personally i 'm not a big fan of football , so i 'm sure if you 're really interested good people of / r/soccer or even / r/poland can give you much more information, 
  so you would rather thay they reported on what the glorious leader tells them ? 
  `` there are no russian troops in ukraine , nothing to see here , go home '' i mean if someone is spinning obvious lies and has his entire administration involved in a giant cover up - you need to report on what 's accidently slipped through . 
  what a great series !, 
  ( the movie sucked though ), 
  `` traffic jams in sochi ? 
  nonsense , i was there many times , never saw a traffic jam '', 
  it 's a big issue in poland , but there are more and more online databases where you can track mileage on pre-owned cars so it 's slowly getting better . 
  worst thing is - it 's not illegal to correct mileage , it 's only illegal to lie about mileage when selling a car , which is opening doors to fraud , like `` it was n't me '' and stuff . 
  this again ? 
  third time i see it by a third different user : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fcxar/i_spent_3_months_travelling_around_the_eu_alone_i/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fz5zv/i_spent_3_months_travelling_around_the_eu_alone_i/ what is it , like a weekly karma harvest ? 
  so what 's georgia 's beef with afghanistan ? 
  i wrote it in an earlier comment and added a map in yet another comment , so i do n't really understand what your problem is . 
  there 's like 15 comments in this whole thread atm , so it 's really not that hard to see . 
  no trickery was used when making this photo . 
  the river forks around the island and the right side of this fork is completely dry like in the photo . 
  i went to the middle of the riverbed and snapped it . 
  the river is still flowing on the left side of this island . 
  i would say not very common unless you run into some football `` fans '' that tend to be quite nationalistic and are looking to cause trouble . 
  ending is hilarious by the way , 
  in this picture the left bank is not actually a bank - it 's an island in the middle of the river ( see google maps link ) , on the other side of the island there is water flowing , but the right side is completely dried out . 
  water level is now lowest in recorded history ( regular measurements started in 1818 , so almost 200 years ), 
  picture taken [ here ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/place/52%c2%b022%2753.9%22n+20%c2%b052%2705.4%22e/@52.381677,20.8689055,16.25z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 ) . 
  pls send h2o . 
  it only sounds good in theory , it 's like it was illegal to be unemployed under our past regime .
