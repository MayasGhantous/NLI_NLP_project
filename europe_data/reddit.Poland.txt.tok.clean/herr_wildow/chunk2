  did n't work so well . 
  do n't ask , it 's a recipe for crisis, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/polish_news_story-7118-%e2%80%98polish_death_camp%e2%80%99_scandal.php ) daily mail from january this year [ here 's ] ( http://niezalezna.pl/69996-norweskie-media-lza-o-polskich-obozach-koncentracyjnych-dyplomaci-i-urzednicy-umywaja-rece ) example from yesterday 's norwegian newspaper ( article in polish ) [ here 's ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3193520/read-real-life-story-auschwitz-prisoner-helena-citronova-falling-love-ss-guard-franz-wunsch-amid-controversy-kate-breslin-novel-time.html ) an example from last week - daily mail again ( corrected by now - [ original screenshot ] ( http://www.polskatimes.pl/artykul/zdjecia/5852222,polskie-obozy-zaglady-powracaja-tym-razem-blad-popelnil-brytyjski-daily-mail,9023986,id,t,zid.html ) ) this is just from browsing recent news - each such case is reported in poland and causes outrage and trust me - i hear about it at least once a month, 
  except it 's not polish anymore ;(, 
  well , you 're wrong . 
  jobs are not a finite good that if someone comes and takes it it becomes unavailable to you . 
  on the contrary , the more people come the more jobs are required in the economy to satisfy their needs . 
  these immigrants need to live somewhere ( jobs in construction ) , need to eat ( jobs in agriculture , retail ) , need to receive medical care ( jobs in healthcare ) , need to raise their kids ( jobs in education , manufacturing , ... ) i 'm sure you get the drift . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/labour-market-effects-immigration ) is a paper on immigration effect on unemployment in the uk , it 's a long read but here 's a summary :  research does not find a significant impact of overall immigration on unemployment in the uk , but the evidence suggests that immigration from outside the eu could have a negative impact on the employment of uk-born workers , especially during an economic downturn pair it with development of unemployment numbers ( 5,6 % - lowest since the crisis of 2008 ) and there 's your result . 
  eh , it 's stuck with us like the polish camps, 
  2 hours and still not moved to megathread ? 
  mods must be sleeping . 
  stopxam is great :-) they also have one of world 's best intelligence service, 
  it is banned in many , my wife works at one and she has like 28 degrees in the office, 
  probably because there 's absolutely no piece of evidence that this crash might have been deliberate . 
  there is resentment against russia , but we do n't need to create false facts , we really have plenty of other incidents to fuel it , 
  for us it must be the [ smolensk presidential plane crash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) - conspiracy theory is that it was downed by russia ( believed by 8 % of poles according to some poll i found ), 
  uhm , i guess you still wo n't find threads like `` hey reddit what 's the most fucked up thing you put in your vagina '' on / r/europe, 
  driving in palermo was one of the scariest experiences in my life , so i 'm not fully with you on this . 
  i mean using a three lane road as it were 4 lane just because 4 cars fit ... was a new experience for me . 
  and poland is quite notorious for bad drivers . 
  i love your use of indicators , if you have your left indicator on it means that you are either turning left , turning right or going straight . 
  ( applies at least to sicily ), 
  you looking for trouble mate ? 
  oh right , my bad, 
  i was n't aware that the difference between eurostat and polish gus is that big, 
  chinese actually . 
  tata motors, 
  still better than `` never happened '', 
  imo it 's only not called genocide , because the word did not exist until 1944 . 
  however i disagree with your point that it 's not genocide because dod n't threaten th ethnic group as a whole . 
  it was aimed at an ethnic group of `` poles living in ussr '' . 
  anyway - here 's what wiki has to say on this topic :  the operation was only a peak in the persecution of the poles , which spanned more than a decade . 
  as the soviet statistics indicate , the number of ethnic poles in the ussr dropped by 165,000 in that period . 
  ** `` it is estimated that polish losses in the ukrainian ssr were about 30 % , while in the belorussian ssr ... the polish minority was almost completely annihilated . 
  '' ** [ 13 ] historian michael ellman asserts that the ` national operations ' , particularly the ` polish operation ' , ** may constitute genocide as defined by the un convention ** . 
  [ 17 ] his opinion is shared by simon sebag montefiore , who calls the polish operation of the nkvd ' a mini-genocide . 
  ' [ 18 ] polish writer and commentator , dr tomasz sommer , also refers to the operation as a genocide , along with prof. marek jan chodakiewicz among others . 
  in my time this was mentioned at school briefly but i think it 's overshadowed by the ww2 atrocities, 
  i have n't seen the movie but i 'm pretty sure it 's about [ katy\u0144 massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) from 1943 - so a different thing from the 1937-38 purge . 
  i wish we had strikes like this at home instead of burning tyres , not only abroad, 
  [ here 's the police sketch ] ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130806003222/breakingbad/images/archive/2/24/20130806011627!heisenberg-large.png ), 
  i do n't understand - it 's about poland or eastern europe ? 
   in all seriousness though - my office building switched off light in all corridors , leaving just a minimum . 
  ac use is being limited . 
  my wife 's office shut down elevators and ac completely . 
  some slightly discomforting things are happening but far from a disaster for now . 
  now millions of americans will have to renounce their irish heritage / s, 
  uhm ... we did it reddit ? 
  wow , that 's some 1939 thinking, 
  on the subject - asz dziennik ( something like polish onion ) : [ nasa : agglomeration of windbreakers on the beach is the first polish structure visible from space ] ( http://aszdziennik.pl/115147,nasa-skupisko-plazowych-parawanow-we-wladyslawowie-pierwsza-polska-budowla-widziana-z-kosmosu ), 
  yup , brought to a beach near you by jan kowalski and prawo jazdy, 
  poor crimea , russia even took away their last socks . 
  well , there 's 30 degrees on empty beaches as well , so ... 
  we love you guys , but our languages are incompatible and language is a big part of culture, 
  it 's one of these polish things that i 'm ashamed of . 
  like the socks + sandals type of thing . 
  yeah , 770 km shoreline but somehow those guys need to go there . 
  smh . . 
  * poland ( home sweet home ) * germoney ( w\u00f6rk related mainly ) * italy ( illegal work as a student + vacation last year ) * vatican city ( sightseeing + backstage entry  ) * czech republic ( cesky tesin + passing by ) * slovakia ( vacation ) * ukraine ( sight seeing trip - lviv , chocim ) * austria ( salzburg & vienna - school trip ) * uk ( went to see a game on wembley ) * lithuania ( sightseeing trip to kaunas , vilnius and trakai ) * spain ( trabajo in bcn + vacation on the islands ) * greece ( great vacation this year in zakynthos ) so 12 , next up - balkans - that should up my numbers quickly , 
  let 's not forget the go-to-butt-of-all-jokes-about-backwards-towns : sosnowiec and radom, 
  i want to visit whole europe , i 'm considering london , paris and rome , any recommendations ? '',

  let 's not forget crocodiles, 
  yeah , we do n't look at speed limits , instead we warn each other against police patrols, 
  hey , it 's not poles !, 
  we drink until 3 am , no way we 'll go to the beach at 7 to reserve a spot . 
  unless ... we go at 3 and beat everyone to it . 
  damn we 're smart !, 
   ( sometimes mixed with cow milk ) i spoke to a lady selling oscypki recently and she told me that anyone claiming they sell pure sheep milk oscypek is a filthy liar , so more like - always mixed with cow milk, 
  for those of you who now think , that this society is probably some random bunch of nutjobs : president of this society and russia 's minister of culture is the same person . 
  excellent website , fbi director should check it out . 
  russians should avoid it though - might spoil pride from `` liberation of poland '' for you, 
  wow , if you 're gay by any chance you really hit the jackpot , 
  tl ; dr :  a billboard in a moscow suburb commemorating the 70th anniversary of the allied victory in world war ii has been taken down after it turned out that the military pilots featured next to the slogan `` they fought for the motherland '' were in fact nazi germany 's luftwaffe pilots . 
  nah , times long gone , we 're on '98 since last year, 
  yeah , the boston marathon - czech govt had to issue an official statement that they 're not chechnya, 
  a lot of veryimportantpatrioticliterature that kids do n't understand and it bores them to hell and discourages from reading in my opinion . 
  if i did n't start reading books for fun before school i 'd probably be avoiding books now, 
  i spent 2 summers working at a farm in italy . 
  best summers of my life . 
  working 6am-2pm , plenty of time to chill , see sights , etc, 
  poor georgia ... remember what happened when putin started telling everyone how he supports territorial integrity of ukraine ? 
  well , to be fair , they do this everywhere and end up in police custody everywhere as well - there must be other reason surely, 
   native language : american english : simplified ftfy , 
  native : polish fluent : english slowly declining from proficient to basic : german learned 20 years ago and barely remember anything : russian survival level : italian can count to ten : french want to learn : spanish or italian , pick up german again, 
  preemptive comment : yes - this is not european union , the title of the article is misleading and i did n't change it because of posting rules, 
  < unpopular opinion  well , he has a point in many things he says about economy , so there 's that . 
  wow , you guys have some strict immigration laws, 
  this guy is like a polish zhirinovski , so you should n't pay too much attention to what he 's saying about foreign politics . 
  they have actually , recently they had a quarrel with kazakhstan for ( among other issues ) letting polish fruit reach russia, 
  finland m\u00e4n is like tis . 
  not shou emousshi\u00f6ns . 
  you know what would be fun ? 
  if usa denied any paratroopers presence in ukraine . 
  it would be hilarious if for a change russia kept showing photos and other evidence and us would just say : yeah , but it 's not us . 
  commonwealth of poland , norway and switzerland , because ... you know ... sharing is caring ^ ( gib gib gib ), 
  polan irrelevant or out of scale ? 
  this was mostly meant as a joke , but if i was to answer this seriously i would say that it 's clearly a union between one strong party and weaker satellites who from time to time rebel against mother russia . 
  this union resembles soviet union,
