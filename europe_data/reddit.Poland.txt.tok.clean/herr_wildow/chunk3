   the measure is based on a court decision in the russian republic of tatarstan that said the sites must delete all their pornographic content within three days or be blocked in the country , the izvestia newspaper reported . 
  so basically - replace your porn content with awww kittens and we 're good, 
  exactly this . 
  i 've met maybe a handful of muslims in poland , i bet 90 % of society never met a muslim ( or did n't know they were muslim ) , but news are packed with reports about isis , beheadings , charlie hebdo shootings , etc. 
  for most people here it 's the only src of knowledge about them . 
  you fear what you do n't know i guess . 
  hey greece , why do n't you ask russia to give you our plane , we can trade later for something nice, 
  it 's fabulous, 
  yeah well , not so easy because our border is eu border so we ca n't just decide this ourselves . 
  hah , i got away with `` both balls in place ? '', 
  man , it was so confusing for me to use coins when i visited . 
  normally when you do n't know your coins you need to look at it and see the number and you know . 
  these pennies though do n't have numbers on them in form of digits , only spelled out . 
  i was getting nervous in shops looking for the right coin having to `` read '' them . 
  i 'm waiting for [ syrena ] ( http://nowasyrena.pl/ ) . 
  i hope it 's not just talk . 
  population of japan + britain + germany = ~ 270 million , total shootings = 8 . 
  your comment is invalid . 
  i thought it was an advert from 1980 but than i got confused by free wifi ... 
  [ did n't stand on a chair this time ? ], 
  you can see my office on this pic  / :( - ca n't decide, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060506180412/starwars/images/7/7c/kenobi_street.jpg ), 
  [ ask and you shall receive ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/number-of-seats-in-the-national-parliament-by-country-in-europe-total-per-capita-map/ ), 
  so , how much do you get paid per post if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  poland [ invented bulletproof vest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casimir_zeglen ), 
  this title gave me cancer , farewell cruel world, 
  czech president is going as well ( i 've heard it 's because they said there will be vodka ), 
   we do n't really have any less experience fighting the russians nor being occupied by them dude , do you even history ? 
  b-but polan not of western , is of central / s, 
  poland : 21 or 26 depending on experience plus public holidays plus some special days like 2 days childcare , special paid days off for marriage , child birth , funeral , paid maternity , paternity , paid sickness ( 80 % salary ) this applies to all contracts under labor law , there are also some freelance contracts ( labor law does n't apply - only civil code ) , that do n't have these benefits , but taxes are lower on these, 
  [ this unfortunately ] ( http://i.pinger.pl/pgr359/d83990280001fafe4c06c68d/sandal.jpg ), 
  in poland you can spell your name in official papers using foreign characters that are not part of polish alphabet , so it 's a matter of approach . 
  nah , this is not my name and has nothing to do with my real name - coincidence about the two w 's really , 
  they 're taking away our w 's :( i have two of them in my surname so it 's right in my feels, 
  shhh , there are muricans in this sub, 
  because we like to have this desert and it 's declining because natural conditions changed and plants begin to grow there again and start to decrease the desert 's size . 
  we want to prevent that . 
  til , i thought you were joking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-td-zzbw6g, 
  but you would balance your budget in a heartbeat , 
  it was the only win of pl over de in football so far so let us bathe in our glory for a while - at least until september when we play again . 
  better yet - we beat them when they are world champs , 
  haha , came here to say this , 
  many vegetables became a thing in kingdom of poland thanks to an italian noble lady [ bona sforza ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bona_sforza ) who became a queen of poland in 1518 by marrying king sigismundus i of poland . 
  she was missing the food and started importing it . 
  thanks to this we also share names of many vegetables with italians , like pomodoro - pomidor ( tomato ) , carciofo - karczoch ( artichoke ) , broccoli - broku\u0142 , etc, 
   a catholic priest vowed to excommunicate all people voting in favour of legalising abortion we have similarly smart priests ( bishops actually ) - they threaten to refuse giving communion to mps who vote for in vitro now, 
  also i heard that polish language is one of two languages in the world that does not refer to italy as a variation of `` italia '' - it 's `` w\u0142ochy '' in polish . 
  i forgot what the other language is . 
  yeah , but not in a very kind way you warmongering aggressors !, 
  1655 - never forget [ ' ] / s, 
  well , i do n't have much experience trying to talk to czechs , but last time i was in slovakia ( not czech rep but language very similar ) i could understand 50-60 % of the written material ( like restaurant menus , traffic information , etc ) . 
  having a conversation between polish and czech not speaking a mutual language would be challenging but in the end i think both sides would more or less understand what the conversation was about . 
  german guy told me they have the same deal between them and the dutch, 
  louis de funes = funny , czech language = funny , combination = laughed my ass off, 
  same in poland . 
  we do n't call it dubbing though . 
  it 's `` lektor '', 
  well , we had a [ statue of red army soldier raping a woman ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/russia-slams-sculpture-of-soviet-soldier-raping-woman-in-gdansk-a-928492.html ) - they did n't like it . 
  some people are hard to please , sigh ... 
  i 'm sure you 'll be fighting to the last fin, 
   in 2014 denmark conscripted 19 people that 's what i call bad luck - be one of the 19 among  million eligible, 
  closest i could find  it 's dialogues from polish movies played over some well-known blockbusters , some of them fit perfectly , like godfather , unfortunately - polish required to appreciate, 
  well so far in this thread nobody said this but you so ... ^ ( flies away ), 
   english -  german is barely noticeably are you serious ? 
  or do you mean barely noticable for someone who only watches dubbed movies ? 
  elaborate ? 
  ^ ( i 'm secretly a fan ), 
  driver uses bribe it 's super effective, 
  as a german , you would probably wait for green ? 
   in poland we go : `` screw it , i 'm going in '', 
  cool , my father has one of people 's republic of poland . 
  i have one of the current poland , proudly holding a rank of `` private in reserve '' having served 0 days  hope it stays this way . 
  from what i remember from some history books uk was traditionally relying on professional army - was the only country in world war 1 to have a professional army . 
  conscription was only introduced during ww1 after massive losses on the western front of ww1 when uk started to run out of professional soldiers . 
  i guess something similar happened during / after ww2 . 
  edit : found [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conscription_in_the_united_kingdom ), 
  hahah , nice one . 
  that `` latvian troops in full force '' picture !, 
  at the same time it 's a shame that we import mostly the shitty sofia wine , i guess because it 's super cheap ( 1,5 euro per bottle ) . 
  i 'm sure bulgaria has some amazing wines to offer instead . 
  i 'm like for my armpits too much to give you advice, 
  donald tusk ofc, 
  oh , now he wo n't be able to decline like ( almost ) everyone else, 
  well , last time they tried poland was ~ ~ enslaved ~ ~ liberated for half a century , so how about no . 
  yep , page 11, 
  [ more info ] ( http://ipn.gov.pl/en/news/2015/missing.-does-anyone-know ), 
  it 's real . 
  birds are a real threat to planes taking off and landing . 
  i know a guy who knows a guy whose only job is to drive very fast on runway of schipol airport in amsterdam to scare off the birds . 
  next up : battle-hamsters and warrior-ladybugs, 
  wow , did n't know that . 
  does this rule also apply to nfl ? 
  yes , that 's the beauty of it . 
  go to the site that / u/cnutethegreat linked put 1 billion as population and 3 as confidence range and you will get required sample size = 1067 you are very resistant to all scientific arguments thrown at you so i think you 're one of these people who ca n't be convinced because they know better regardless of facts, 
  then you are questioning 99 % of all research conducted in the world where ~ 1100 responses is considered representative to population, 
  \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0435\u0442 3,4 % which should be translating to something along the lines of :  the survey took place between 13 and 16 march 2015 and was conducted throughout all of russia in both urban and rural settings . 
  the survey was carried out among 1600 people over the age of 18 in 134 localities of 46 of the country 's regions . 
  the answer distribution is presented as percentages of the number of participants along with data from previous surveys . 
  the statistical error of these studies does not exceed 3.4 % . 
  kinda addresses your concerns ?
