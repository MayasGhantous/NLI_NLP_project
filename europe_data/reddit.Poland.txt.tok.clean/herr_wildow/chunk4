  being a statistics major myself - this very much applies to humans, 
  i think you 're reading this wrong - it 's the mongolians who migrate to s korea, 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_korean_defectors ) - most north koreans escape to china by far , this kazakhstan thing must be bullshit, 
  probably one or two guys managed to escape to kazakhstan and made the stats , 
  i think it 's kazakhstan, 
  sorry for this click-bait title , interesting read nevertheless, 
  only place where it 's allowed in pl, 
  reminds me of list of countries where playing poker is illegal : ** poland ** , afganistan , saudi arabie , bahrajn , bangladesh , egypt , iraq , iran , yemen , jordan , qatar , kenya , best korea , cuba , libya , malaysia , mozambique , nigeria , pakistan , rwanda , senegal , sudan , syria , tanzania , zimbabwe , uae and a few more . 
  shit , that breaks my heart . 
  when i imagine the terror of the kids while plunging ... 
  ah , there is `` archives '' caption on it, 
  [ first photo of the crash site apparently ] ( http://www.aa.com.tr/fr/headlines/482968--un-avion-a320-de-la-compagnie-germanwings-secrase-avec-142-passagers-a-bord ) edit : it 's not , i 'm dumb, 
  french president said that most passengers were german and that it 's possible that people on the ground might be dead as well . 
  do you have an address in poland ? 
  if not - they do n't have the means to call you in i guess . 
  nobody will bother looking for you abroad . 
  they 're only summoning 12k people country-wide so the chances of you getting summons are very slim i would say . 
  i hear they 're summoning only ( mostly ? ), 
  guys who had some basic training before . 
  a guy i know got summoned , but he did some basic military course while in university . 
  none of my colleagues who - like me - did n't have any training due to studying - got summoned ( yet ? 
  it 's easy to check if the apples are polish , if they are rotten they 're polish or so the official reason for the ban used to say, 
  well , that 's settled than . 
  case closed , reparations paid . 
  eot, 
  someone at my work place brought this glass taken from a welding mask - you could see the eclipse perfectly . 
  warsaw - not a cloud in the sky , perfect weather, 
  i see it , i see it yay !, 
  well , immanuel kant was a real pissant who was very rarely stable , so there 's that . 
  [ russian embassy in warsaw ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/zmq7mdqsmcxkzcwxmguwldk3ztswniwzmjasmwmy/0a3f0a4e023807467654d0a3f245f4c3.jpg ) occupies ( sic ! ), 
  a very nice building . 
  would n't mind getting this one back . 
  [ it is i , leclerc ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5173/5459944020_87ef53612a.jpg ), 
  reports change frequently - now there 's talk about 7 poles killed , 11 in hospitals, 
  i saw them live in warsaw once , they supported ~ ~ gorgoroth ~ ~ enslaved iirc , but that was like 10-12 yrs ago, 
  i think most widely known polish bands are [ vader ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdo0rvlgsi4 ) and [ behemoth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t1bbhwz6r4 ) my fav pl metal band is probably [ lux occulta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhhxha33u0e ), 
  let 's not forget homonazi propaganda, 
  i 'm pretty sure fans from each country can say the same as you - there are a lot of metal fans and metal bands here in [ insert country ] . 
  it 's just there are more in some than in others . 
  nice find !, 
  it 's like denying you 're a unicorn, 
  congratulations on discovering that upvoting is not equal to opinion polls and elections . 
  if it was we would have kim kardashian 's arse for president . 
  * wilno , 
  it 's this time of year again ? 
  time flies ... ( pun not intended ), 
  including 4 million in athens urban zone . 
  that 's more than a third, 
   en route to poland please do n't invade us, 
  there 's always some asian that does it better, 
  i saw the first pic and thought - what 's so scary about a little bridge ? 
  [ then i scrolled down ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-ykugirkym ), 
  personally - with the amount of free content available online - i would n't pay a penny for being able to read an article . 
  i like the idea of having one place where you can read news from around the world , but hey - i have reddit for free , so why bother ? 
  let 's add ourselves then : poland 19 %, 
  not germany , also not australia, 
  i witnessed etna eruption in june last year , not as big as this one but still amazing to watch, 
  a restaurant owner in poland did the same , but it was against the law to discriminate so he had to take the sign down, 
  hungary : i was expecting reference to porn industry, 
  what do you expect . 
  this is how pis does things . 
  put a random accusation out there and it 's your turn to prove you 're not a horse . 
  germany also fell in ranking ( 4 places 8 -  12 ) . 
  maybe rsf decided censoring immigration issues is less of a violation than turning public media into govt circlejerk club ? 
  reminded me that i have to get rid of my rotting sandbox that i was supposed to do last year . 
  dear gods of procrastination ... 
  this vid is golden !, 
   ca n't stop humming ... 
  yes ( hick . ), 
  you need to know te story behind - this poem -  turned national anthem was written when poland was not on the map - 2 years after partition of poland and 121 years before we became a country again . 
  so you see why it 's relevant . 
  so , like half the population lives on roughly half the territory ? 
  how bizzarre !, 
  yes , with easter close second . 
  actually - it depends who you ask , according to the catholic church easter is the most important one , but i do n't think anyone would sriously put easter ahead of christmas . 
  i think it indeed is unfortunate because it shows how effective soviets were in rooting out national traditions celebrated for centuries . 
  we had this in poland as well . 
  in post war poland some national holidays were replaced with soviet holidays like july 22nd , may 9th , october 12th etc , which had nothing to do with our tradition but had everything to do with very recent ( at that time ) history of communism . 
  what a bitter `` i told you so '' ... 
  it very much is !, 
  i loved it so much . 
  `` pani twardowska '' is my favorite poem ever , my mom used to recite it for me all the time when i was a kid , so cdpr earned some karma points with me with hos . 
  because competitors offer a similar product for free maybe ? 
  at least that 's why i 'm expecting a product for free . 
  i remember huge protests against kevin smith 's dogma . 
  if not for them i would n't have heard of the movie . 
  great publicity ( great movie btw ) . 
  they interviewed the protesters and - of course - not one of them saw the movie . 
   krak\u00f3w 's christmas market is located in the middle of the old city . 
  those who are not warmed by the romantic setting might find a bit of polish vodka helpful . 
  i 'm sold . 
  it 's the first time i 've seen it ... this week . 
  that way you risk burns and you share your sweaty pants vapor with other sauna-goers . 
  it 's gross . 
  you go naked or if you 're shy you wrap yourself in a towel . 
  one of the preconditions of forming the commonwealth was that the grand duchy had to convert to christianity . 
  by doing that the duchy avoided being forcefully christanised by the teutonic order . 
  the wars with teutonic order that followed were more of territory wars rather than religious .

  true + spanish and german are fully translated i believe .
