  awful , it 's usually full of `` let 's make fun of the lower class '' type of jokes and alcohol jokes , neither of which i enjoy . 
  zegar ( clock ) , which is apparently a german loan word , but it 's not even used in modern german anymore ( clock = die uhr ) . 
  sad they 're leaving . 
  i enjoyed both of my trips to london and hoped i could see more of the country in the future . 
  it wo n't be as easy when the borders are closed again . 
  no , never . 
  same is expected from guests . 
  it 's mostly acceptable to shit on absolutely every ethnic group you can imagine ( including poles ) , but living in warsaw i also encountered a good amount of what you americans call the `` college liberal youth '' . 
  criticising blacks/muslims ( despite the general lack of them in poland ) within their ear sight will get you some ... quite negative reactions . 
  national flags ? 
  all of them , even before i found about subreddits like / r/askeurope regional flags ? 
  i 'd have difficulties . 
  i do n't even recognize most of the polish ones lol . 
  poland - turning away from europe , lack of investment in r&d and hi-tech , growing demographic pressure europe - raise of nationalistic/far-right parties across the continent , uncontrolled migration world - climate change , growing overpopulation, 
  ... trust me , you do n't want the first one . 
  especially since it tends to contradict your third wish . 
  i still remember when people tried to push for fptp here in poland lol . 
  so glad it failed in the end . 
  i honestly do n't remember the eu being used as a scrapegoat much here in poland . 
  nationalists sometimes try to use this rethoric but almost no one buys it . 
  pretty sure it would be called a lorry . 
  i still would n't call it a ( cultural ) stigma . 
  things like being openly pro-russia on the other hand are . 
   being abstinent or vegetarian/vegan not true in my experience, 
  nintendo handheld crap and mobage but after seeing the switch conference i 'm not sure if i 'll stick with them for another generation, 
  one of the worst criminals in the world 's history . 
  there is nothing more to say . 
  butthurt, 
  the ones i tried on my trip in usa were genuinely awful , i liked the peanut butter cups a friend brought me a few years later though . 
  then again i just love peanut butter :p, 
  well , depends on how you decide to define the west . 
  if you define it in cultural/political terms then being poor/rich is certainly a valid argument . 
  pretty sure argentina used to be very developed in early xx century but since they picked a really bad thing to specialize themselves in ( beef export ) the whole country fell flat on it 's face the moment beef demand dropped in the countries they used to export to . 
  kind of like russia and oil today . 
  furthest west i 've ever been was niagara falls in canada , furthest east - cyprus . 
  i 'm hoping to visit japan in the near future , my brother could n't recommend it enough when he was there . 
  furthest north i ever was was denmark i suppose . 
  furthest south - ontario in florida . 
  honestly , if eu disintegrates waiting a couple of hours to cross the german border will be the least of our issues . 
  all of the male ones ? 
  what kind of question is that really . 
  honestly if thats what counts as `` shitposting '' on this sub be glad you never saw what real shitposting looks like . 
  not very due to a mix of personal issues , country politics , which took a very wrong turn in 2015 , and general european politics ( the rise of far right in the west ) , which i 'm afraid will also affect my country negatively . 
  these are probably more `` slang '' than `` ancient '' , but around my parts we use : paczka ( a packet ) - 100 z\u0142oty kafel ( a tile ) - 1000 z\u0142oty ba\u0144ka ( a bubble ) -1 000 000 z\u0142oty, 
  i 'm annoyed by the influence it has on the polish society , especially as a person born in a non-religious family . 
  decreasing catholic churches power in poland is the reason i will keep voting left wing even if the rest of europe goes full hitler . 
  i did n't have a favourite school subject . 
  i choose to take additional classes in history/social sciences but i quickly lost interest in both since the teachers were just plain awful . 
  i was decently good at biology and physics despite not actually understanding a single thing about the latter . 
  finally i was also good at geography and foreign languages but those were so easy it almost feels like cheating . 
  personally , i 'm not seeing or feeling it . 
  then again i primarily consume japanese entertainment , rarely listen to radio music and pretty much never go to the cinema , so i might be biased in my views . 
  in poland - unemployment . 
  maybe it 's just me but i did n't even notice when people finally stopped complaining about it ( or at least not as much as they used to ) . 
  in general - banking services definitely . 
  wow , all of this looks delicious !, 
  may i ask what is that green/yellow spice on the ham on the fourth pic ? 
  yes . 
  i always help with the preparations . 
  traditionally the first day of christmas in poland ( christmas eve ) you 're not supposed to eat any meat , and we hold up to this tradition . 
  this year we 've made a bunch of gignerbread cookies , two different cakes ( [ murzynek ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-smt4aoieuag/tvzgjrqm5gi/aaaaaaaasiu/72k--iber4s/s1600/dscn7972.jpg ) and [ keks ] ( http://przepisy.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/keks-z-bakaliami-13833045748kng4.jpg ) ) the so-called [ greek fish ] ( https://pl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryba_po_grecku ) ( no english links , sorry ) , a bunch of different salads and apperitizers and about 100 pierogi ... do n't ask why , i do n't know either lol . 
  oh , and we also bought some borscht , a cheesecake and a traditional [ poppy cake ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dru8m9hdqqe/maxresdefault.jpg ) to round it off . 
  in elementary school , yes . 
  we had a similar thread [ yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5jo7me/what_is_being_a_european_today/ ? 
  same in poland , but at the same time nobody thinks we 're not europeans . 
   what i love about poland is how its citizens do n't accept autocracy and stand up to its government . 
  lol, 
   american value having movie star teeth much more more like shopped toothpaste tv advert teeth lol, 
  well , now at least they have funding to run a proper election campaign in 2019 . 
  there is no unified image of what `` european '' is or even should be . 
  countries as different as sweden and albania are both european , and neither have an authority over the whole continent to dictate `` yes , * these * are the values a european should represent '' . 
  so from the continent 's perspective , `` european '' is impossible to define . 
  from the outsiders perspective ( americas , china , japan etc ) , `` european '' is most commonly associated with values held by the north-western peoples of europe . 
  alas , that view is obviously simplified and excludes about 2/3 of the whole continent , which might not be necessarily be `` liberal '' , gay friendly , weed smoking , arrogant and whatever else . 
  i said this in another thread not that long ago , but just because they decided to cherry pick certain left ideas that would help them secure votes among the uneducated lower class ( i.e. 
  their target voter audience ) does n't mean pis as a whole is a left wing party . 
  case in point , their political programme does fuck all to promote equality among different social groups . 
  it 's all muh country , muh family ( this is where your `` leftist '' 500 + and mieszkanie + comes into play ) , muh cathoshit fake posturing all over again . 
  as you said , no one with any knowledge of the politics considers sld a left wing party , and razem ( the only real left party ) has a whopping 1-2 % of popular support in the latest polls . 
  everything else is too fringe/niche to be considered seriously . 
  you mean one can be born in a specific country sarcastically ? 
  wew , wish i had known that earlier , would 've picked a more meme worthy place . 
  you forgot your / s, 
  they have 98 % of the voter base , give or take . 
  interesting theory . 
  most : some places are good to visit if you 're looking for cheap holidays i guess least : the low salaries , the undeveloped institutional system , the unremarkable culture , the embarassing history , the rude people , the ugly cities , the unpleasant climate ... 
  i could go on . 
  teeth whitening is not a popular practice here . 
  the lake is very calm . 
  i never steered a ( motor ) boat before but i learned the basics very quickly ( having a driver 's license helped , haha ) . 
  honestly there is n't a better thing to do at the garda lake when the weather 's good . 
  even if you do n't want to steer the boat yourself , sunbathing on the bow ( ? 
  not sure if i used the correct term here , the front part of a boat ) [ while the motorboat is racing 60 km/h ] ( https://youtu.be/fe_ogaw7azg ) is the coolest thing i experienced this year . 
  make sure to rent a boat if the weather is good ( it probably will , it 's italy ) . 
  great fun . 
  in addition to what was already said , social services financed by high ( er ) taxes were introduced in an attempt to prevent the spread of communist ideology in western europe . 
  as far as i know , america was never under a threat of becoming a communist state . 
  in spain , a shop co-owner ( roughly 25 y.o. ), 
  asked me if poland is in the european union . 
  this was in 2014 , ten years after we became a member state .
