  and a couple of obvious culinary terms like paczki and pierogi ( s ) . 
  they were originally shipped from principality of prussia ( hence `` z prus [ ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119cych ] ) by hanseatic merchants . 
  it 's tasty but sadly quite unhealthy . 
  this one gets me every time  most trustworthy : germany  least trustworthy : germany, 
  every country in western europe suffers from varying degrees of smugness . 
  easterners are probably the least smug . 
  that security camera in the upper right corner is just a cherry on top . 
  nationalism and religiousness . 
  in america , the quality of food ( or rather the lack of thereof ) . 
  i firmly believe american accent was the best thing to ever happen to the polish language . 
  so cute and immidately reconisable !, 
  on which subreddit ? 
  certainly not this one . 
  even people with eu flair usually tell where they come from . 
  they 're everywhere , especially in the countryside . 
  we 've got nothing on italy though , which i swear has a virgin mary chapel in every second backyard . 
  it became a breakfast staple in my household together with cereals , eggs and pancakes . 
  the taste reminds me heavily of my favorite childhood [ peanut-flavoured crisps ] ( http://static1.money.pl/i/msp/znaki_towarowe/214/400054 ) ( sadly not sold anymore ) , so it was a love from the first bite so to say , haha . 
  the peanut butter sold by a polish company sante is excellent and the only one we really buy . 
  i like the smooth variant the best , but most of my family seems to prefer crunchy , which is sweeter and less dense . 
  kao the kangoroo back when i was a kid . 
  it aged like milk though . 
  this right here . 
  my grandma was a policewoman during commie times , and she always told me how she hated guns even though she was taught how to use one , so that affected my opinion a bit too . 
  i 've been to majority of western europe and a decent chunk of central-east europe ever since i started traveling at 3 y.o. 
  from memory i count 20 european countries i 've visited ( not just passed through ) until today . 
  after all these years , my favorite is still spain . 
  you just can not not love the climate , the people , the cuisine and the beautiful cities . 
  my least favorite is ... probably my own , sadly . 
  we dont really have anything that is n't done bigger , prettier and cleaner somewhere else . 
  i found both prague and budapest to be more impressive than krak\u00f3w for example . 
  not much in terms of nature either . 
  the masurian lakes can be pretty cute though . 
  special mention goes to la defense in france . 
  while i otherwise like the country , that place fills me with dread . 
  never again lol, 
  fuck no . 
  since october 2015 i wish for an early election every single day . 
  probably anyone but that puppet szyd\u0142o lmao . 
  southern warsaw and the municipalities surrounding it ( like [ konstancin-jeziorna ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstancin-jeziorna ) ) are the most well-off in general . 
  a small town [ nowy s\u0105cz ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nowy_s%c4%85cz ) in lesser poland hosts the most millionaries per capita in the country though . 
  edit : here 's a map of [ purchasing power in poland in 2016 ] ( http://pliki.portalsamorzadowy.pl/i/09/07/19/090719.jpg ), 
  according to / r/europe 's poll poles are the third or fourth most common european nationality on / r/europe . 
  i assume it 's not much different here on r/askeurope . 
  so despite coming from one of the less notable european countries , i do n't feel underrepresented at all , 
  russia easily , considering a large chunk of their country is in asia . 
  that post was a joke/follow up based on [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5b4cwt/poland_belarus_eu_and_georgia_are_the_top_most/ ) . 
  good eye lol . 
  that 's what i get for quicktyping on my phone ... 
  kaunas/kowno 's tree is nicier . 
  sometimes less is more . 
  yes , but they 're ( literally ) dying out . 
  polish sld ( `` union of social democrats '' ) is comprised of people who used to be the memebrs of the polish communist party ( and they 're not even hiding it ! ) . 
  also , the current ruling party ( pis ) has apperentely the most former communists as active party members . 
  and yet they still call anyone they do n't like `` communists '' lmao, 
  hard to say , but things look pretty grim so far . 
  the french elections are going to be a major turning point if le pen wins . 
  they do n't call them po-bis for nothing . 
  people here prefer to game on pcs or smartphones because everyone has one and you can pirate all of the games for free . 
  i find / v / 's mustard rice meme funny in the polish context knowing the kind of toasters people usually game on in poland . 
  speaking about personal experience , i used to hop between both sides of the `` barricade '' rather frequently . 
  when i was a kid i used to play on both pc ( first my parents amiga , then my own pc ) and consoles/handhelds ( ps1 and gameboy ) . 
  nowadays i tend to stick to just the nintendo handhelds ~ ~ and smartphones ~ ~ , which is unusual in poland to say the least . 
  genre wise i tend to favour jrpgs , dungeon crawlers , vns , puzzle games and some rhythm games , but i 'm willing to play almost anything as long as it 's good . 
  not perceiving race as important = / = not `` seeing '' race . 
  i 'd argue cultural / ethnic background strikes much more controversy in europe than having a slightly brown skin does , whereas in america it 's the other way around . 
  not a federalist but i think it 'd be impossible to unite humanity like that unless we find aliens . 
  ( edit : or they find us ... ), 
  yes and no . 
  it was a complete waste of time of course but you could say it was there due to `` popular demand '' . 
  most of my close friends are / were at least somewhat religious , though it was impossible to tell at first . 
  by far the most ridiculous was my high school - me and one other student were the only two out of like 30 who opted-out of the religion classes , and i got called a `` godless heathen '' when i told one of the girls in class that i did n't do the confirmation yet ( still did n't lmao ) . 
  two of the boys were planning to become a priest after finishing high school and one of them told me his dream is to become the next pope ( he was n't kidding ) . 
  our polish language teacher was a religious right wing cunt who 'd go on long-ass rants to prove god exists . 
  mind you , this was all in warsaw , the supposed capital and `` progressive '' centre of the country . 
  i ca n't even imagine how bad things must be in the countryside . 
  so basically everything, 
  because nintendo consoles are virtually unknown here and the political discussion is insanely cancerous in nature ( think youtube comments tier ) . 
  i think we have a winner here !, 
  english is a european language 2 . 
  loan words are not a good example of language being used less 3 . 
  in everyday conversation , native language is undisputed king , unless you work for an international corporation or something . 
  on the internet its a matter of choice . 
  i 'm fairly sure that unless you speak something very obscure every european language has lots of it 's own content to dig into . 
  english is often preferable for things like tv series and video games due to slow translation process though . 
  not really ... there is n't much keeping us together other than hate for mena immigrants ( which are n't even interested in settling down here ) . 
  i 'd wager that even in case of eus breakdown , new union ( s ) would start being worked on the very next day . 
  so yes , it will survive , even if under a different name . 
  that our entire history consists solely of being trashed by germany and russia . 
   now, 
  it represents pretty much everything i hate about poland except even worse, 
  i like it for having all gen 3 features + the battle frontier mostly and fuck you flygon is my boy, 
  they generally begin slowly rolling out their christmas-themed decorations/ads/merchandise after the all-saints day ( 1st of november ) . 
  no christmas music yet but i saw christmas themed chocolates in shops already . 
  i love the entire original spyro trilogy . 
  i still replay it from time to time , i swear it never gets old . 
  pokemon emerald for gameboy advance i 'm still salty gamefraud dropped the ball with the 3ds remake, 
  i do n't have a credit card and i do n't know anyone who does . 
  everyone uses debit here . 
  i read that they banned it because sometime during ww2 shady bakeries put sawdust inside bread to reduce production costs .
