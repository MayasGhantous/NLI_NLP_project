  goetterfunken diminishes, 
  migrants would be bone of contention ... 
   in favour of american in favour of anyone who can deliver lng at a good price : qatar , norway , canada , usa ... 
  they were only following orders , right ? 
  loss of prestige in terms of anyone leaving the project ? 
  yes !,

  this article could mean something a year ago , it does n't bring any fresh opinion to the table . 
  attempted to go from split to dubrovnik via the adriatic highway . 
  was travelling at a snail 's pace following a bus . 
  could not overtake it due to heavy traffic . 
  finally got stuck in traffic in omis . 
  i decided to cross the mountains to enter the real highway . 
  travelled in comfort on a nearly empty road . 
  have you ever hear of retaining knowledge ? 
  i 've seen it . 
  a cross on one side of the river , minarets on the other . 
  btw , you should see saudi and turkish `` cultural institutes '' . 
  the saudi one is huge . 
  now i understand where the name comes from - it appears slanted . 
  with these graffitis it looks like just a single finger . 
  the middle one . 
  it kind of worked for 20 years ( no pogroms or any major tensions ) until germans came and killed most of the jews . 
  then the allies sat with soviets and decided they will create a monocultural country within different borders , so we lost ukrainians , belarusians and most of other minorities . 
  poland has been multicultural until ww2 . 
  i assume that czechoslovakia and hungary as well . 
  i could n't agree more on this . 
  on one side , guys who are more concerned about what the eu would say rather than what 's good for the people who put their trust in them .

  it 's also martin schulz 's party . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/07/china-rare-earth-village-pollution ) is the cost of producing wind turbines and solar panels . 
  to be fair , eu scientists are working on electric turbines which require no rare earth magnets whilst being light enough . 
  upon closer inspection , few exhibits seem to be protected under glass covers . 
  hmm , it must be difficult to control humidity in this museum . 
  maltese is classified as a semitic language because it is descended from medieval arabic . 
  so , like in any other country which has been blessed with mass tourism ? 
  is it uncommon to see signs in maltese in malta ? 
  attacking the police and lying about his id when questioned ...

  gay friends told me that they wo n't participate in the parades as they tend to misrepresent the image of the majority of gay people instead of helping to bring the message that they 're worthy of the same liberties as straight people because they 're a part of the society and not a fucking freak show . 
  it is [ nikolai valuev ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikolai_valuev ) , a professional boxer , not putin 's bodyguard .

  answering pawlak 's question whether his pm nomination would be legal .

  and called a tigerphobe .

  you got a link to an article . 
  it 's in polish , but there is google translator .
