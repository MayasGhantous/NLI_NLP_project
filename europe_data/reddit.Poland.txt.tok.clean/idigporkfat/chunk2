  it has never happened in poland . 
  stalinist prosecutors , judges and prison commanders retired to foreign countries ( notable examples are [ helena woli\u0144ska ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/helena_woli%c5%84ska-brus ) and [ stefan michnik ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_michnik ) ) in result of the internal purges . 
  post-stalinist communist apparatchiks and commanders of security organisations retained their wealth , titles and most were buried with state honors ( [ wojciech jaruzelski ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/wojciech_jaruzelski ) , [ stanis\u0142aw kocio\u0142ek ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis%c5%82aw_kocio%c5%82ek ) and [ czes\u0142aw kiszczak ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/czes%c5%82aw_kiszczak ) ) . 
  there were attempts to prosecute and try them , but they managed to remain out of prison . 
  `` bold line '' ( dividing the past from the future ) , which almost granted the immunity for the perpetrators of the communist crimes ) was a part of the transition from the socialism to the liberal democracy . 
  its main proponent was adam michnik , a dissident , but also a step-brother of the aforementioned stefan michnik . 
  his war cry was `` fuck off from the general ! '', 
  to those who have challenged wojciech jaruzelski 's presence in public and political life of the post-communist poland . 
  his newspaper published interviews with said apparatchiks on anniversaries of bloodsheds they were perceived as being guilty of . 
  i do n't think so . 
  in one move they considerably inreased retirement age ( by decreasing school age and increasing retirement age ) . 
  they also snatched retirement funds to repay internal debt ( `` ofe reform '' ) . 
  according to the stats , poles work longer hours aweek than many nations . 
  if you think it 's still fair , compare retirement age and longevity . 
  we still have not cought up with western europe . 
  it was a desperate move from then-current president to increase his chances in the upcoming elections . 
  as you know , he failed miserably . 
  this was the sole `` contra '' argument . 
  how can you get additional clarifications without reopening the case ? 
   i too read gazeta.pl it 's nothing to be proud of . 
  france has a history of military leaders in charge of the heads of the state . 
  the people who want the case to be revised are not necessarily fans of conspiracy theories . 
  to me , the botched `` investigation '' was in fact a cover up for negligence . 
  https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bodybag_ ( tasche ), 
  germans love to reinvent english words : * mobile phone - handy ; * backpack - bodybag ; etc. 
  [ it 's been like this for ages . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_germany ), 
  is n't this because many polish immigrants have double polish & german citizenship and are n't accounted for ? 
  just asking . 
  unless the law enforcement ca n't reliably identify you because of wilkommenskultur ( i.e. 
  letting in thousands of people without any proof of identity on them ) . 
  see what happened to the perpetrators of cologne new year 's eve attacks . 
  nobody should trust german mainstream media after what happened in cologne . 
  strangely enough , the violence ended when pis came to power . 
  some say that violence was instigated by agent provocateurs . 
  and the exodus of people from warsaw happens with every long weekend . 
  if you have n't noticed previously , you probably were away as well . 
  the transcripts which you are referring to have to be supported with a fair amount of guesswork in order to come to this conclusion . 
  i agreed that the will of the families must be respected . 
  however , i pointed out that the inquiry was negligent to a degree that bodies were misidentified and buried with foreign objects sewn in them . 
  oh , i see that you are an armchair analyst and that you hate pis . 
  pis needs a legend , that 's true . 
  however , negligence of russians forensic experts was so `` impressive '' that it needs to be inquired . 
  agreed . 
  when few bodies were exhumed it turned out that they were incorrectly identified - families buried remains of another persons . 
  one person had a cigarette butt sewn inside him . 
  that 's the quality of the russian work performed under supervision of the anty-pis polish government . 
  according to your flair your support kod , which means that you do n't support figures presented by the ministry of interior ... 
  the 67k estimate came from mayor of warsaw , who openly supports kod . 
  the estimate of the police was 75k . 
  thank you and apologies for the idiots who damaged property . 
  do n't believe in everything which media feeds you with . 
  you know that football hooligans are a minority ? 
  you ca n't judge a country by football hooligans alone . 
  i have romanian neighbors , they have been to poland for 10 years now which i think tells a story by itself . 
  please come to poland for a few days and enjoy . 
  i 'll be more than happy to hear your opinion about your stay . 
  not really . 
  there were some epic moments but some guys believe that we are really different from the rest . 
  were are n't . 
  a very nice concept but the technique is too lacking to justify the need for higher resolution . 
  yobnem is far more common . 
  why ? 
  every faction has a narrative . 
  you are good as long as you are allowed to choose what you believe in . 
  are you serious ? 
  what lynching ? 
  swastika , sickle and hammer ... 
  these are symbols of ideologies , not nations . 
  when you point that out , feminists spin it as a sign of misoginy - women treated as incubators . 
  similarly , this one will be probably spun as government treating women as being weaker than men . 
  so why do you waste your money on internet fees ? 
  it could feed a hungry person !, 
  what 's `` nationalistic '' ( i think that you meant shauvinist , xenophobic etc. ), 
  about national flags during national holiday ? 
  there 's a difference between celebrating a national holiday and being a shauvinist , but you need to push your agenda , right ? 
  not surprised at all . 
  silesian dialect has tons of loanwords from german . 
  `` polski fiat '' is more commonly associated with fiat 125p aka `` du\u017cy fiat '' . 
  they also credited the source ( radio bia\u0142ystok ) , but you need to spin the discussion towards football hooligans and nationalists ? 
  they are not the only ones who celebrate today 's holiday . 
  i 'm sick of progressivists spinning a narrative that these are to create pis militia ( think iranian women corps ) . 
  this is nothing more than your typical self defense course . 
  the only difference is that these will be based on polish army unarmed combat system rather than eg . 
  such courses were previously offered by multiple ngos and even warsaw city council and no-one raised such concerns at the time . 
  similar courses organised by ngos and city councils were quite popular . 
  agreed . 
  women in poland also receive more free healthcare than men . 
  yes , you can use another facebook . 
  in poland . 
  censorship is censorship and discrimination is discrimination even when on a private property . 
  remember when a baker refused to bake lgbt propaganda cake in the uk or a printshop refused to print lgbt leaflets in poland ? 
  eheim to the rescue !, 
  same as bonaparte/buonaparte . 
  such a germanic toponym ... 
  it was , and remains , a symbol . 
  also referred to as the sea of rubble . 
  i like to show these pictures to people who complain about `` too many commie blocks and generally appaling architecture of the city '' . 
  the capital of poland had to - and was - rebuilt quickly to accommodate the rapidly growing population . 
  i like [ this one ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/warszawa/images/1/17/mural_patriotyczny_pilecki_\\ ( by_bartekbd \\ ) . jpg/revision/latest ? cb = 20140721142443 ) dedicated to [ witold pilecki ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/witold_pilecki ) .
