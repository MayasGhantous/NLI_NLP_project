  a lecture about islamic terrorism counts the same as someone being punched in the face for being brown in their books . 
  how many of them are nazi skinheads ? 
  got any source ? 
  they are n't a uniform group . 
  the pictured ones are probably white legion , a white supremacist hooligan group . 
  legia was fined multiple times because of their symbols being displayed . 
  poor oppressed germans, 
  i could argue that flares do n't belong to a football event either . 
  nationalist are getting ready for another march . '', 
  it 's a nazi thing , according to the narrative of the left . 
  chokha is a part of a georgian wedding attire , so it could be true . 
  on the other hand , acceptance of gay marriage is at 3 % in georgia iirc . 
  it 's not about commemorating the fallen but rather celebrating the `` infallible spirit '' , would n't you agree ? 
  966 refers to the year of the baptism of poland ( in fact , personal baptism of mieszko , the first ruler of the polish state ) . 
  i 'm not a fan of football hooligans , but they definitely have not hijacked anything . 
  the official celebrations were boring ( politicians talking ) and to be honest almost noone celebrated it apart from couple of families lighting a candle on the uprising fighters ' graves . 
  football hooligans need a mythos and they 've picked up one - they strongly identify with the city , so the invincible city mythos perfectly suited . 
  and so it began . 
  not patriotism itself , but celebrating it . 
  it became popcultural , to the point of t-shirts , mugs , graffitis , tattoos , [ bed sheets ] ( http://wielodzietni.org/uploads/editor/qm/s772qp7zsiog.jpg ) and [ baseball bats ] ( http://cdn29.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/546567/patriotyczny-bejsbol.jpg ) being available . 
  my take is that the symbols of the past were largely ignored by the progressive forces , who focussed on pushing eu insignia and legend of guys whom noone recognised and thus could n't identify with - parada schumana anyone ? 
  that 's definitely a cultural phenomenon worth researching . 
   ~ ~ poles ~ ~ football hooligans do love pyro, 
  everyone forgets pozna\u0144 , it is and was an important polish city . 
  the ku just does n't get in the way , it just rolls off the tongue to make way for the glorious rolling r , which helps to vent anger . 
  the wa is a snappy syllable to cut it away from the rest of the sentence . 
  it might be true for low skilled people . 
  if you 're qualified enough , you may move to another city and be able to sustain yourself or even a family . 
  living in a cramped apartment without family is not something unheard of . 
  not everyone is able to afford a decent standard of living , at least initially . 
  po did n't criticise the system when they benefited from it ... 
   seems that this exact narrative has been pushed by jan szyszko , the polish minister of environment and was contradicted by robert cyglicki , the polish greenpeace director . 
  do you mind quoting the greenpeace guy , please ? 
  let me hear the arguments , not the name of the person who arguments . 
   bogdan jaroszewicz , the director of the bialowieza geobotanique station said `` i 'm not saying that the bialowieza forest is virgin or pristine or something like that , we do n't know if it 's natural 10 , 50 or 70 percent , but it 's the best that we have '' that 's essentially what i have written . 
   what a coincidence . 
  i 'm sure no polish politicians has any personal or monetary interest in this aspect . 
  this reeks of corruption , manipulation and a money grab operation and i have only researched it rather superficially . 
  if you accuse someone of corruption and `` money grab '' you 'd better research it more thoroughly . 
   one last question for you , if you do n't mind , which polish party do you adhere to , or you are most fond of ? 
  does it change anything ? 
  i 'd personally vote for a social democratic party should it exist . 
  you just need an anti-adblock rule . 
  the protected part is indeed the primeval forest ( technically , the protected part consists of areas under different types of protection ; the unesco area was entirely within the strictly protected part until 1996 . 
  in 1996 , it has been extended , but still does not cover the entire area of the bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest . ) . 
  it is key to understand , that only the part under strict protection has seen very little human activity . 
  all other parts have been impacted by human activity which stretches from at least 18th century until 1990s . 
  wwf hosts an extensive [ archive ] ( http://www.wwf.eu/what_we_do/eu_forests/saving_biaowiea_forest/ ) dedicated to the issue . 
  states that the beetle infestation was spreading mostly across the areas impacted by human activity , where spruce is overrepresented ( this type of tree has high commercial value in comparison with other types . 
  they are not logging the primeval part . 
  the logging occurs in the man-planted forest which surrounds the primeval one . 
  the man-planted forest has unnaturally high percentage of spruce , which fuels the beetle infestation . 
  however , i agree with scientists that this man-planted area should be left alone to protect the primeval forest . 
  according to scientists , the commercial exploitation in guise of `` sanitary cuts '' may impact the primeval forest area even though it is not being logged . 
  so , let 's stop saying that the primeval forest is being logged , because it is not true , but focus on the opinion of the scientific community instead . 
  powering the anti-pis sentiment . 
  the protest against `` reform '' in judiciary has lost its momentum , so there is a need to find another cause . 
  i 'm not saying that there is no merit in criticising government 's stance , but it is more than often blown out of proportion with a clear intent to incite protest . 
  do you also have an impression that whenever there is any article which suggests that there is any problem within germany , it gets heavily downvoted ? 
  they ** do ** charge . 
  randomly adding results of multiple political parties to bolster one 's agenda . 
  gazeta wyborcza constantly calls kukiz a puppet of pis , why did n't they merge kukiz 's results with those of pis ? 
  for anyone curious - that 's one of the results of the so-called reprivatisation as implemented by warsaw 's glorious liberal leaders . 
  after ww2 communist nationalised land plots with rubble which used to be privately-owned houses to facilitate reconstruction of warsaw . 
  the city was rebuilt , the streets were re-drawn , so that these plots are now parks or schools and the former owners ( or rather mostly a mafia-like syndicate who buy back or fabricate claims ) get back land instead of being compensated in money . 
  one guy is notorious in doing whatever he wants to do - he cut down trees in a park plot , rents the land to kebab shop owners and now has installed this plane-based structure which resembles a shabby bar which can be found next to a 2nd class road rather than in a city centre . 
  it does not make much sense to measure progress by gdp or average wage in post-communist countries : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/513099/_/d79cnmr, 
  do n't blame jesus !, 
  there was/is a crisis in portugal , was n't it ? 
  the problem is that the tax-funded media are used as propaganda and low-quality show outlet . 
  they are in direct competition with commercial media and also have commercial breaks . 
  there are numerous accounts out there , please check e.g. 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/poi3b2qhrc0 ) . 
  general sosabowski was portrayed as the only one with clear view of the situation . 
  in reality , he became a scapegoat for a failure of market garden . 
  after the war , he barely made ends meet by working in a factory in the uk . 
  `` young and educated ones from big cities '' is a cliche describing `` lemings '' , blind followers of the liberal-progressive parties . 
  she did not save anyone and drowned herself . 
  risk taking is not a good strategy unless someone else will take the brunt ( see 2008 banking crisis . 
   a leading french philosopher who advocated risk-taking has drowned after attempting to save two children at a beach on the french riviera . 
   the two children were later rescued by lifeguards and were unharmed . 
  oh , the irony . 
  bad risk assessment . 
  turnout was not `` only '' 51 % . 
  poland has a history of low turnouts - see [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/pl/timeline/539ec7f403b65b58beae0ddf553be988.png ) . 
  he did not receive nobel peace prize , the solidarity movement did . 
  his wife went to stocholm to receive money which some solidarity members say vanished into thin air , i.e. 
  were never transferred to solidarity . 
  during his time in `` prison '' he ordered the following : * 2 bottles of strong liquor * 289 bottles of vodka * 158 bottles of wine * 59 bottles of cognac * 239 bottles of champagne * 1115 bottles of beer source : https://mobile.twitter.com/cenckiewicz/status/809024478365753344/photo/1 it was a luxury internment . 
  what really puts me off is his braggadocio ( `` i won the fight with the communists singlehandedly . '' ), 
  and inability to admit his relationship with the communist state security service despite numerous documents and testimonies appearing over the years . 
  research the authors of said articles . 
  you may discover that it 's a single person or a bunch of happy copy-pasters . 
  so much for critical journalism ... 
  he is largely irrelevant since he lost elections in 1995 . 
  for example , in 2000 election he only won 1 % of votes . 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa was a very bad president . 
  he used divide et impera policy to exercise power and was a notorious power tripper . 
  that 's when he antagonized kaczy\u0144ski et al. 
  actually the current constitution was written to curtail president 's powers due to wa\u0142\u0119sa 's exploits .
