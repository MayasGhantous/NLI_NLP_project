one is in central europe and they are the most liked of our past occupants . 
  other is east of poland and had fauna that wants to kill you . 
  you are in the second verse of the anthem , italy is in refrain . 
  also we kind of like our shared king . 
  biggest asian minority here . 
  pbrobably between czechs and slovaks, 
  it 's linked to the fact that people are more likely to have met `` romanian roma '' , than `` romanian romanian '' , and `` romanian roma '' they meet are more likely to commit crime/be beggars than `` polish roma '' . 
  houses are mostly secession , town hall is neo-gothic/neo-renaissance, 
  technically the church did n't care if you were gay or not . 
  you are supposed to be celibate anyway . 
  they only recently started asking . 
  it never will . 
  in 70 years people will learn `` he died in a airplane catastrophe it may have been assasination , we will never know . 
  just like we learn now about w\u0142adys\u0142aw sikorski . 
  it was most prominent argument when our government was po and opposition was trying to sound reasonalbe . 
  now government is pis and they stopped using logic . 
  afik most reasonable argument against quotes was that we are supposed to somehow `` keep them '' , and we are unable to do that unless we treat them like prisoners . 
  that 's somewhere in rome . 
  or was it universe 's belly button ? 
  yep , we are both somewhere near centre of europe . 
  yes . 
  we have less auxiliary words like that ( only `` will be '' ) on the other hand we have aspects , question word for yes/no questions . 
  but what you say means you can learn some languages and not notice some things both languages share . 
  no it 's not more acute . 
  other way round it sounds like `` i exist go to work every day '' `` i own saw this before '' . 
  foreigners who have one present tense in their native language just do n't know which tense to use . 
  you speak about actual knowledge of foreign language , i speak about the knowledge that different language work differently than you native one . 
  we should create an eu english , with standardised spelling, 
  is there other indo-euroean language that does n't have `` ihr '' ? 
  it 's german equivalent of phrasal verb , those are hard and in german at the end of the sentence instead of just before or after the verb . 
  why do you talk about south slavic when ukrainian is eastern ? 
  for example in polish `` kraj '' and kraina mean country , land , region . 
  in czechia and slovakia it 's the name of their regions . 
  polish , bealrusian , ukrainian slovakian and serbian are more closely related than japanese , korean and chinese though . 
  i may be wrong but i would guess that hugarian is more closely related to ukrainian than those three asian alnguages to each other . 
  also the europe/asia border , and if you count land under the sea . 
  good to know . 
  not everywhere , somewhere between germany and russia , gulf of finland , and romania . 
  oh , i read you start much later . 
  maybe those people are all americans then . 
  i know many people who `` never learn '' too , but i think even being taught a language makes you understand some quirks about your own . 
  you talk with a `` singy '' voice , but learn polish very fast . 
  kiev is impressing , and there are ( were ) relatively cheap night trains from kiev to lviv . 
  you keep celebrating summer solstice two weeks too late . 
  you too ? 
  i thought it 's poland/lithuania/latvia / estonia/slovakia/belarus . 
  ( i think it depends which islands are taken into account and how it is calculated ) * edit : forgot belarus, 
  i think it comes with both british and americans learning their first foreign language so late . 
  let me be clear : it amazes me that english speakers are suprised by other languages having compound words when they have fucking phrasal verbs tenses that use auxiliary words . 
  i do n't understand , i just mean it 's silly that english speakers claim that german verbs like vorhaben are strange , but then try to translate `` is going '' to `` ist gehen '' or `` jest id\u0105cy '', 
  what makes me laugh every time is english speakers trying to translate to other languages and treating `` is doing '' as two seperate words . 
  but our current government can not accept that it was accident . 
  half of their voters are based on conspiracy theory . 
  poland is being turned to austria and nobody cares . 
  hast du `` narrenturm '' gelesen ? 
  co to jest `` nederdraad '' ? 
  yes , but prussians had their army in poland in mobilization . 
  there was no `` polish borders '' in 1830 . 
  but we had an uprising in 1830 , so prussians were busy fighting us . 
  i know right ? 
  but for everything they did to not have tusk elected ? 
  they lost . 
  i had to google the reference  . 
  the day before 1 december . 
  however long november is . 
  we really liked the last time , we get your competent politician , you get our fucked up rules of government . 
  and coincidently everybody calls the new union-country poland . 
  he will come back just in time for 2020 president election . 
  he will come back just after the elections , elections have to be held before 12 november 2019 , and tusk will end his presidency on 31 november . 
  if it goes with calendar they are going to be in autumn 2019 , tusk 's mandate ends 30th november . 
  even if it were possible to hold elections after that date , pis can dissolve the parliament earlier . 
  tusk can come back for the president election in 2020 . 
  it 's bad only for polish ruling party . 
  that `` barbaric '' ham looks fake . 
  maybe if you are original polish one you would change your mind . 
  does anyone else have enough negative electorate , that people would vote against them , instead of against le pen ? 
  since poland is `` latin american '' and cyprus is south asian you ca n't really complain about germany being `` protestant '', 
  they are doing it as a private company , that is owned by lech kaczy\u0144ski insitute , that is owned by the party . 
  it is up to the city government to give out permt to build it . 
  just a commercial building - office space for rent , lower floors for shops and services . 
   the envisaged project is an office building including service and retail functions as well as a four-level underground car park . 
  its three-storey podium will include services and retail . 
  what is the story behind austria - rakousko ? 
  what i meant is : do lithuanians drink it ? 
  or do they just sell it to tourists ? 
  happy resurrection day lithuania , 
  is 999 actual lithuanian thing or only export thing ? 
  ( my mom loves it ), 
  why did n't you tell us in the early 90s ? 
  they cite a source that is a lot longer http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/02/01/what-it-takes-to-truly-be-one-of-us/, 
  afaik it comes form old high german , as is written here . 
  it came to polsh from czech , and to czech from german with christianity . 
  they did n't ask czechs at all . 
  you did n't notice * catholic - we would have to ban those filthy protestants and orthodox too . 
  usa one or eurasia one ? 
  now the question is - how long before all those get into traffic accidents . 
  / s ( there have been 4 traffic accidents caused by american military ), 
  how can we not be more slavic then western if we are slavic ? 
  if i read it right , it counts all migrations - wwii , relocation after war , war in balkans in 1990s . 
  i do n't know about other nations - but if we count all germans born `` in poland '' , and all poles born `` in ukraine '' before 1945 that shifts the numbers .
