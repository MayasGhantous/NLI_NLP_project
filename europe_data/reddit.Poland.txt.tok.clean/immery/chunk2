  ( less every yest , but still ) but you ca n't disregard those countries because those are still common direction of emigration . 
  you did notice those mountains between poland and czechia - we have higher between us and slovakia . 
  but it had `` suburbs '' sprawling outside the walls , and two towns just outside the walls . 
  and somehow gender equality scores higher than free elections in poland . 
  yes , you are right . 
  poland 64 +30 pakistan 64 +26 south korea 64 +31 ghana 65 +18 south africa 67 +21 russia 58 +33, 
  what is this map ? 
  if it is for some role-playing or alt-history purposes it needs some commentary . 
  if not - still needs some commentary . 
  it was linked in some other comment . 
  it seems the question was : how important is it to have ____ in our country ? 
  is it very important , somewhat important , not too important or not important at all ? 
  c. women have the same rights as men and 64 % polish sayd very important , 30 % somesomewhat important . 
  it seems it was divided into very-somewhat-not too important - not important at all .

  on contrary , it seems it was divided into very-somewhat-not too important - not important at all .

  if you look at research , it is possible that men voted gender equality as `` somewhat important '' ( 30 % ) , because if everything is `` very important '' ( 64 % ) then nothing is and i can see how censorship , free elections and freedom of religion can be seen as more important ones . 
  in poland - it 's not like they were given a choice . 
  two main parties had female candidates for prime ministers . 
  but it is also the matter of - what were exactly the questions asked . 
  edit : i checked the survey - it seems 30 % of poles said it is somewhat important . 
  i think poland 's data is legal abortions performes in poland , not abortion tourism to czechia and lithuania . 
  http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-polish/be-at-the-mercy-of-sth-sb be at the mercy of sb/sth to be in a situation where someone or something has complete power over you, 
  i 'm pretty sure we have . 
  just not enough for anyone to care . 
  all those `` right '' voidvoiships are now ukraine/belarus/lithuania . 
  combining the fact that in those regions were poor and rural , eastern ii polish republic had many people who did n't have polish as their `` native language '' , the fact that poland as a country existed at this point for only 10 years . 
  those with 49 % were under russia , and not part of `` russian poland '' . 
  i do n't know if they surveyed `` any literacy '' or `` literacy in polish '' , and russian alphabet is different . 
  it 's a 1933 data . 
  edit : apparently i ca n't read . 
  it 's 1931 data . 
  i some may choose different ones in winter but i understand what you mean . 
  how do you protect your skin from frostbite ? 
  do you wear skiing mask and goggles ? 
  i 'm pretty sure most women use creams all year round , but i understand your meaning . 
  maybe they are called differently ? 
  or maybe only women and kids use it because `` men are strong '' . 
  well it does n't have to be winter cream , most fat based creams would work . 
  you can use baby oil too . 
  my mom says her grandma used lard . 
  winter cream and a scarf ? 
  that polish people are likely to somehow mistake word `` cygan '' and for `` rumun '' ? 
  i do n't . 
  i 'm not sure anybody tried . 
  ( i now do n't know if you believe poles are that stupid , know people that are that stupid , or think those words sound alike ) . 
  i have trouble with romans romanians and romani in english , but in polish those words look and sound different . 
  that many romanian romani came to poland in the 90s - this seems like a credible source ( in polish http://www.romowie.com/instytut/io2007_lechowski.pdf ), 
  still , no way to mistake them for `` rumuni '' ,, 
  polish do n't generally confuse rroma and romanian , because gypsy is `` cygan '' , rroma are romowie and romanians are rumuni . 
  now the reality was once that many romanian rromani came to poland . 
  for full disclosure i stereotype rumunia with gypsies , holiday destination , fine china , vampires and sebastian stan / s, 
  pis is not anit-eu , they are content with the way eu is , they do n't want further unification , and of course they do n't like that eu is against them . 
  pis does n't like the socialist label so they created `` solidarity '' label instead . 
  do we exist or have our dear neighbours already come with some help ? 
  we had a queen before . 
  now her son . 
  one of the three . 
  but not supreme court one , the regular courts one . 
  according to wsjp.pl it seems `` bo\u017ca kr\u00f3wka '' is 7-spotted ladybug , while biedronka is any ladybug . 
  think the cgi of invisible yennefer taking a bath with soap foam revealing her curves, 
  i think when tusk gave copy of witcher 2 to obama everybody heard about it . 
  it 's huge for gamers and fantasy fans . 
  in poland it 's `` tusk 's wines '' . 
  or fault . 
  ( nobody knows ), 
  it 's too early . 
  everybody knows cold comes between 12 and 15 may . 
  how is that connected to `` freedom if press '' ? 
  whatever the state-own media does ( and pis is making obvious something that was on lower level happening all the time ) , private media are not censored . 
  you are not the only one . 
  it depends on the choice . 
  sometimes you can feel like both are evil , but neither is lesser or bigger evil . 
  you can be equally not ok with both choices . 
  it is hard to tell if usa christians and eu christians showed in the statistics are `` real christians '' , or they never bothered to unlist themselves , or answer the question on in the `` heritage meaning '' . 
  it is easier to tell why it looks like usa christians look more insanly . 
  - the most religious parts of eu are catholic , or orthodox - and those churches while very traditional are also more rational . 
  edit '' of eu '', 
  what 's up with our vowels ? 
  we have 8 +1 / 2 . 
  you mix us with croats . 
  no it is n't . 
  during communism shops were closed on sundays . 
  that came with capitalism . 
  but now we have discussion about it . 
  the map is from polish newspaper . 
  are n't those in austrian ? 
  it depends what you look for . 
  there is the average score where you are better, 
  nothing . 
  there are no eastern european countries in eu . 
  russia and belarus already have a union so it would affect only ukraine who would n't join them now when they have war with russia . 
  i do n't think easter is catholic only i think it 's christian . 
  also i think it was a celebration of spring atleat since christianity came to parts of europe that have winter . 
  there are no eggs rabbits or chicken in the bible . 
  i do n't think the language in which czechia was written exists . 
  it has polish cz but czech \u00e1 . 
  and it 's adjective in both . 
  \u017cyletka for razor blade , from gillette , like rower it is so old nobody remembers its origins .
