  british tv is seen as better than american here - probably because you export only the good ones . 
  i ca n't imagine how it is to feel foreign in your own country , and i 'm sorry for all those who do , but at certain points that is the reality , you are essentially both . 
  but it 's what you see , and what we are talking about . 
  but let 's be real here . 
  i have a relative who is `` 100 % polish '' and moved to usa when she was a little girl in 1950s or 60s . 
  she was raised polish , and visited poland even during communism . 
  she lost touch with family and poland in 1980s but visited poland again in 2000s . 
  she does n't understand poland as it is now , and speaks with heavy accent . 
  she is a polish person who lives in america . 
  she has two kids who are `` 50 % polish '' , and afaik hold both american and polish citizenship . 
  they have been in poland once for a week , they can say `` tea '' and `` thank you '' in polish . 
  i consider them americans with polish citizenship . 
  fucking fog everywhere with a flavour of smog , and freezing rain . 
  today is has the worst weather . 
  do n't you think we are kind of weird this way ? 
  with all ko\u015bciuszko / chopin/sk \u0142odowska / mickiewicz , polish anthem literally saying that polish people will come back from italy to save the nation , and the government in exile in london ? 
  if you found out one of your great-great grandparents are not form switzerland but from denmark - would you call yourself 1/16 danish ? 
  i 'd say 2010 polish air force tu-154 crash https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash, 
  it does n't hit the news in poland . 
  probably because we are not the ones to protest . 
  is it something you hear about often , or do you live in disputed teritory or sth . 
  because til about that border dispute . 
  that depends on the connection . 
  i would prefer you to say that you have polish heritage/ancestors . 
  if you told me you are polish , i would want to talk in polish to you , then i would remind you that we have separate word for polish diaspora . 
  if you have citizenship , you have the right to call yourself polish citizen . 
  you are still polish - american until you come here to live ( then you become american polish ) . 
  if you are a celebrity , polish media will find your polish ancestor from 200 years ago . 
  polish lyrics are not pessimistic - it 's literally `` we are not dead yet '', 
  do you sing it in german or croatian ( the eu anthem ) ? 
  wow that 's long . 
  ours is only 4 and still most people know 1 or 2 + refrain, 
  do you learn it at school and later forget ? 
  or you do n't have to learn . 
  do n't they play it when you win olympic medal or win some other competition ? 
  in poland people ( media ) sometimes count gold medals in `` mazurek '', 
  that is original painting made by eye witness/s, 
  well , supposedly our lady of czestochowa was made by saint luke . 
  while luke did n't see baby jesus , he painted mary just like she was just younger . 
  on the more serious note - i think many portraits of jesus are based on manopello image and turin shroud . 
  i do n't feel like reading those , but you may https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madonna_ ( art ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/depiction_of_jesus, 
  yes . 
  but in case you were wondering - you ca n't hear gunshots from poland . 
  in poland we have informal `` ty '' vs formal third person pan/pani/pa \u0144stwo / other titles . 
  i think this varies greatly etween places and circumstances , but teachers always use `` ty '' for kids , and it shifts sometimes in late high school and in university . 
  i would n't ever use `` ty '' in shop unless they are my friend . 
  in work that depends on the workplace , some places are more likely to be all `` ty '' , and others are more formal . 
  in the work related situation ( client-office ) i insist on using `` pani '' even if in other circumstances i would already be on the first name basis . 
  we have this semi formal way where instead of `` pan/pani + surname we use pan/pani + first name ( often diminutive ) . 
  we also use other titles like `` priest , sister , doctor '' instead of pan/pani/pa \u0144stwo . 
  the same goes wirh `` mom '' `` dad '' ` uncle '' etc. 
  i usually use `` ty '' with my parents , unless i want to be extremely polite but i always use third person with aunts and uncles . 
  europeans : is anybody not left-libertarian here . 
  i feel like kaczy\u0144ski would be left libertarian on this scale . 
  general knowledge ? 
  afaik not so much . 
  we are stuck with polish history and usually just the most glorious or martyr parts . 
  in school - no . 
  at all levels of education i was never taught english by a native speaker . 
  in language schools - yes , and all of them were americans ( but they taught british english ), 
  that map was supposed to create `` twenty eight equally sized european union member states '' it does not resemble reality . 
  it is complicated , but it is legal . 
  ( but it 's tax free for tourists ) . 
  i meant more for south-east ( ma\u0142opolska + podkarpacie ) as most religious parts . 
  i think all the shops in krak\u00f3w old town have the sign `` we accept euro '' . 
  i live near the ukrainian border , and most of bigger shops - furniture , electronics , big chains have the `` we accept euro ' signs , ( next to tax free for foreigners sign ) . 
  my local shop also has we accept euro sign . 
  i wonder if it really works . 
  they have `` you can withdraw cash while paying with card sign too , and every time i ask about it it does n't work . 
  strill there are more religous places , and less religous ones . 
  % of catholics that go to church on sunday http://mapy.gis-expert.pl/mapy_iskk/02_dekanaty_domnicantes.jpg % of catholics in the area http://mapy.gis-expert.pl/mapy_iskk/05_dekanaty_wierni.jpg ( red line is the pre wwii border ), 
  we want them . 
  but if someone brings up partitions ' borders i want them to be accurate . 
  the post i reacted to was edited since then , so now i look like a whiner . 
  this is classic . 
  so many countries think they can spot their compatriots by that . 
  they exist here - they are in shops , but i do n't think they are popular . 
  congress poland . 
  krak\u00f3w is vibrant , full of students , tourists and corpo people . 
  it is a big city and we were talking about small , slow , and conservative places . 
  i like them though . 
  but i get angry when galicja ( austrian ) and kongres\u00f3wka ( russian ) get always lumped together . 
  we are not the same . 
  fucking prussian side thinking they are better poland . 
  try tarn\u00f3w or brzesko if you want something near krak\u00f3w and a bit more populated . 
  f * ck you with used to be russian . 
  the best shitholes in the south used to be austrian, 
  the reason for it is that , while most people have nfz insurance - if you are employed , you pay it with taxes , if you are self employed you have to pay it , if you are registered as unemployed you are covered , etc , but there is this gap - people who have a temporary job but are not employees - and they do n't have insurance . 
  you mean something like paternal leave . 
  i think some countries do it . 
  in poland part of the leave is available for a father but `` surprisingly '' , families usually choose that mother takes it . 
  on the other topic i wo n't comment . 
  i do n't understand . 
  woman will always be the one who is pregnant and gives birth . 
  the whole thing was a mess . 
  it was not a pis project , but `` pro-life '' citizens project . 
  there were supposed to be two possible laws discussed - the `` pro choice '' one and the `` pro life '' one . 
  pis promised to accept both for further work , then rejected `` pro choice '' one and accepted `` pro life '' one . 
  people got scared , women protested . 
  two days later in `` pis '' - style of randomness , the pro-life law was rejected .
