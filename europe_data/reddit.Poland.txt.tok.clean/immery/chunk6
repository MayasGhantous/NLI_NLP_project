  i am a polish woman . 
  i think we mostly have equal rights by law , but we are not always treated as equal in society . 
  we are seen are more fragile and less competent . 
  there is one issue where women and men can not be equal - pregnancy . 
  this leads to different issues - law preventing pregnant women from some jobs can be seen as unequal , some people say longer maternity leave is feminist , other that it is anti-equality . 
  the most dividing issue is abortion - which some people see as a right to one 's body , other as killing innocents . 
  i am rather pro-life woman , but last year had me scared . 
  the idea , that every miscarriage could be investigated as abortion , united women in defence of women 's right . 
  edit - typos and commas, 
  i would probably prefer automatic , but i also prefer to be able to afford a car , so manual it is . 
  ok so vyrobene vs narajeno , that 's how i 'm going to recognise your products . 
  and how is `` made in slovenia ' in slovenian ? 
  it 's the same in poland - orze\u0142 ( eagle ) and reszka . 
  does reszka have any other meaning in russian ? 
  changing `` outdoor shoes '' to `` indoor shoes '' . 
  i think we have a case of `` lost in translation '' here . 
  or maybe false friends . 
  in polish `` patriota '' it is '' someone who loves it 's fatherland and nation and is ready to work for them , and to sacrifice something for it '' `` nacjonalista '' is someone who believes that their nation is the most important value , and willing to sacrifice rights of other people and nations . 
  but then oxford dic has nationalist 1.1 * a person with strong patriotic feelings , especially one who believes in the superiority of their country over others . 
  we were at a period when poland was divided into smaller parts , ruled by the dukes , so technically it 's all masovian 's fault . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_i_of_masovia#teutonic_orde r and yes sobieski is the most famous . 
  but i was thinking `` medieval '' . 
  in poland eastern mediterranean crussades are mentioned in few words in history classes . 
  i think i also had one lesson in religion class on `` crussades were not as horrible as you think '' but i do n't know if it was curriculum or our priest trying to find something interesting to teach . 
  teutonic state , on the other hand is obviously taught with many details , and it 's seen as the biggest enemy , that we brought for ourselves twice . 
  ( once when we invited them , second when prussia was created ) . 
  i never learned at schoolabout existence of other crussades - anti heresy ones . 
  and anti-ottoman crussades of xv century are mostly known for the fact that king w\u0142adys\u0142aw ( of varna ) died there . 
  but is n't what you wrote european kind of genealogy ? 
  you know history of your family , you know your coat of arms . 
  how is it not genealogy ? 
  you just do n't need to dig it up , just add yourself at the bottom , and then your kids . 
  these are two different questions . 
  my mom is into genealogy , and i think in poland it is getting bigger every year , mostly people in their 60s are interested in it . 
  but it is not on the level of americans . 
  it is about family history , and not nationality . 
  the fact that one of my great-great grandfathers was born in moravia does n't change the fact that i 'm polish , it just means that to research more of that branch we would have to go there . 
  but finding out who your ancestors were , where they lived , what was their job etc. 
  is fascinating . 
  nationality is not genetics . 
  it is language and culture and sense of identity . 
  may be regional thing . 
  do you have much experience with peoples full names ? 
  mine is n't that much but i see about 10 documents a month . 
  it was 2 in the whole polulation in 2009 . 
  male version is marian and was 32 in the popuation . 
  in my experience most polish people have middle name , they just rarely use it . 
  and many girls have maria as middle name . 
  can i call you latvians then ? 
  it 's so much easier to spell / s, 
  i think planks come in 2.5 and 3.2 cm so it 's almost as if we used inches . 
  the same thing with screws . 
  i really hate the inch thing with computers/tv screens/phones . 
  some sizes feel more like clothing sizes . 
  jeans sizes in inches are just sizes to me not dimensions , especially when like with any other piece of clothing two pairs with the same size do n't always fit, 
  that one is polish , or `` shared heritage '' ( depends on etymology you accept ) either filip was old polish word for hare , or there was a man called filip from a place called konopie that said something stupid on `` sejm '' . 
  nobody granted liberum veto . 
  it was old law that started being abused . 
  and the first time it actually happened we were between kings . 
  in poland if the holday is on sunday you `` lose it '' . 
  but if you work monday-friday and holiday is on saturday , you get extra day off for that saturday . 
  it 's up for the company to decide when you take this day off . 
  i stopped caring about it , because it 's too much . 
  i googled it now and there is `` a voice '' suggesting they should land , try until they make it . 
  one website says it 's the general - head of the air forces , other website say it 's a director of protocol . 
  the problem is - after all the talk about fake fog , explosive materials and exhumation of the bodies , nothing is seen as real . 
  there is also almost legal one that targets self-employed people . 
  if you are self employed , you are in register that is free of charche , and open for anybody to see on the internet . 
  but people that just started , and older people often receive `` bills '' from `` fake '' companies for being on that register . 
  it 's technically legal because those companies run on-line registers of people they scammed . 
  it 's funny , because now the official government registry is like 1/2 page actual content , 1/2 this registry is free we do n't send any bills, 
  is something still a conspiracy theory if your country elected people who believe in it ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash#conspiracy_theories edit : forgot to write what it 's about : people believe 2010 catastrophe in which president kaczy\u0144ski and many other prominent people died was not accident but assassination . 
  poland has a new `` free day '' on three kings . 
  we used to just mark the doors with k+m+b + year , and have some carols , but now people needed something to do on the new holiday , so we have processions of magi in every other town . 
  so we have a very new ( like 10 years ) tradition now . 
  in most situations `` macedonia '' ( same name for the country and the region ) . 
  according to wikipedia poland is one of the countries that accpet the name but uses `` republika macedoni '' as official name of the country while `` talking '' with macedonia , and `` by\u0142a jugos\u0142owia\u0144ska republika macedonii '' ( polish translation of fyrom ) in international situation like un . 
  poland ( podkarpackie ) - it snowed yesterday , but it did n't melt so today also counts ? 
  i 've always heard that the `` no meat '' is a pagan tradition and `` fish '' is a christian addition ( in slavic countries , no i do n't know if it applies to balts ), 
  have you seen aftermatch of a football match ? 
  it 's only 1 dish with fish at my home . 
  no meat on the whole day . 
  and we get creative with counting so 4 pies are 4 dishes , etc. 
  it 's always fish and no meat on the 24th , dinner is in the evening , after the stars show up ) in poland . 
  it 's supposed to be 12 dishes - also mushrooms , cabbage poppy seeds and honey, 
  i 'm not a `` real monarchist '' . 
  as far as i know our monarchists want a king that would have real power , not a figurehead . 
  they also do n't really have a candidate . 
  poland does not have anyone who would be `` rightful king '' . 
  we would have to elect him . 
  that is how it was in poland . 
  right now `` president of poland '' is only a little bit more than figurehead , he also gets elected every 5 years and the election is always very heated . 
  i do n't want to imagine what would happen if we elected for life . 
  the polish-lithiuanian commonwealth was created because we run out direct line jagiellons . 
  jesus and mary both . 
  but she rules since xviith century , we still had `` earthling '' kings with queens consort then . 
  i may think that we would be better with a monarchy like british one , but considering our history it 's impossible . 
  i see what you ( lithuanians ) did . 
  i just meant that after plc probably both poland and lithuania was kind of used to choosing their own rulers and democracy .
