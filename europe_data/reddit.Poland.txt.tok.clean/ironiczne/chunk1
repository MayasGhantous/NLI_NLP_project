i 'm not sure , he 's just a great comedian . 
  i have n't laughed so hard at any other movies than those with louis . 
  my parents also introduced his films to me and i 'm not a fan of any other foreign actors . 
  one of the best actors of all time . 
  i 'd love to hear your side of the argument . 
  it 's a constant struggle for them . 
  god bless our brothers and sisters for remaining true to the faith of christ . 
  i 'm sorry you do n't know basic science . 
  life starts at conception and the act of abortion mutilates a developing human being . 
  people have no right to deem someone inhuman because of what stage of development they 're at . 
  encouraging the murder of kids and birth control is resulting in the gradual extinction of europeans . 
   backward old fucks die out yeah , because killing your kids is so progressive . 
   they 'll run out of men long before they 've done any serious damage . 
  there 's ~ 600,000 muslims left in sweden ( with more coming in every day ) , so it 'll be quite a few attacks until they ` run out ' . 
  have fun with that , though . 
  ironically , it sounds like stockholm syndrome . 
  if you stop terrorists from coming in , you win . 
  `` if we let them kill us , we 'll win . '', 
  what kind of mentality is that ? 
  the us killed 200 civilians in an airstrike in iraq last week . 
  that 's a funny way to spell constantinople . 
  sounds like their arse is still sore from 1683 . 
   yes , i absolutely do expect it . 
  this is why your countries are a joke . 
   the problem lies in every foreign-language-sermon , not only in the muslim . 
  i 've been a practicing catholic my entire life and in all of that time i do n't think i 've ever heard a politicized homily/sermon here in poland nor the polish/english/latin / german/dutch masses i attended while i 'm vacationing or visiting family abroad . 
  the difference between churches and mosques in the west is that the churches are loyal to the dioceses in the country . 
  mosques are loyal to whatever country funds them and their imams ( usually turks or countries from the persian gulf ) . 
  from the consensus on this subreddit and most other european sources , these countries train their imams to preach anti-western messages to their congregations living in europe . 
  it 's about belonging to a culture and ethnicity . 
  you ca n't be german , polish or swedish unless you were born into that culture and ethnicity . 
  there 's whites that have lived in africa for 300 years and they 're still considered as second class citizens or europeans over there . 
  do you really expect sensible people to classify recent immigrants ( e.g. 
  arabs/africans/asians ) as europeans ? 
  well that 's why i said ` think what you want ' . 
  i 'm sure the tanned germans are very nationalistic towards their new homeland . 
  whatever you say , gypsy . 
  being born in germany does n't make them germans , but think what you want . 
   i think there are also english services for expats and maybe some christian sects still have latin in their service . 
  all of these would be affected as well . 
  yeah , except the priests celebrating a mass in latin or english are n't spreading anti-eu/anti-western propaganda and are n't in the pockets of middle eastern fundamentalists associated with terrorists . 
  40 % of people in germany that are under 5 are from a migrant background , so there you go . 
  after spending a few hours on liveleak and seeing what happens in third world countries , i promised myself i 'll never go vacationing outside of the eu . 
  it would be in the interest of russia to create tensions between ukraine and poland , though . 
  you mean i should n't trust r/the _ donald as a credible source for european demographics ? 
  today people would complain that there is n't enough diversity in the picture . 
  there 's nothing wrong with discouraging the spread of a mental illness . 
  well , can you find me a single message of hate/violence that was preached by jesus ? 
  we should be buying nuclear missiles instead . 
  maybe it 'll help get the point across . 
  christians follow the new testament . 
  except that christians are meant to follow the new testament , the old testament is the torah meant for non-gentiles ( jews ) . 
  diversity is germany 's strength . 
  do n't forget the cocaine . 
  we might as well make a unified army while we 're at it . 
  the eu should just form its own army . 
  edit : ree auto-correct, 
  proud of my country . 
   and 17,0 % participate in communion regularly . 
  that does n't mean anything . 
  you 're only supposed to receive the sacrament of communion if you 've been to confession . 
  i 'd be more disturbed if the percentage was too high . 
  why is it alarming if a nation retains its belief in god ? 
  except being atheist ** is a problem ** , therefore ridiculing people who keep indoctrinating their innocent children ** is necessary ** !, 
  most people in my country are patriots/nationalists . 
  if you look at our history , we would n't exist if we did n't care . 
  breivik said he believes in odin and the orlando massacre was done by a muslim . 
  name a few terrorist attacks committed by christians ( barely any ) and examples of major news outlets not calling them terrorists . 
  we have one of the lowest fertility rates in the world . 
  whether you support the current government or not , anything they do to increase the number of kids born is beneficial for our country . 
  breathtaking . 
  i hope to visit one day !, 
  looks like the german shills are at it again . 
  christians follow the new testament . 
  [ \\  modern europeans ca n't even compete ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/013/306/2dd.jpg ), 
  as usual , it 's some old leftist . 
  [ mike ` suck a cock get a shock ' pence ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/1jc4y0.jpg ), 
  i hope you realize that child mortality rates back then were much higher . 
  besides that , they were also taking in children that no one wanted ( often sick children ) . 
  giving them a burial does n't make them murderers . 
  based egyptian father . 
  [ waiting for you m8 ] ( http://img.joemonster.org/mg/albums/new/140331/polak_zwyciezyl_w_grze_o_tron.jpg ), 
  give back wilno, 
  what 's the proof that they ` murdered ' babies ? 
  besides even if this claim were true , why is the general public complaining if they are trying to legalize the murder of babies ( via abortion ) ? 
  what specific things make our democracy similar to that of russia or turkey ? 
  also , you 're one to talk . 
  your governments and their agencies cover up crimes committed by foreign ( non-eu ) immigrants just to keep them coming . 
  on top of that , they try to bully other countries into accepting said foreign nationals . 
  this whole fiasco is revolving around accepting potential terrorists . 
  how about we focus on the actual goal of the eu : maintaining economic partnerships between european countries . 
  the eu leaders should n't try to undermine our countries because we try to focus strictly on the original goal of the eu . 
   why do n't you just leave and join some shitty russian union ? 
  all these flavors and you chose to be butthurt, 
  this must be a troll post ... do you really believe we 're trying to subvert it ? 
  is that what your media is saying ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  what is your idea of democracy , my friend ? 
  france ca n't bully/trick countries in an economic union to accept non-eu members that have caused them so much grief ( these people cause daily terrorist attacks ) . 
  we 've already taken in over a million ukrainian refugees/immigrants in the last few years .
