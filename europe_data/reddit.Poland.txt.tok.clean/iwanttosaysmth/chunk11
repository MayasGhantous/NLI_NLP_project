  the same way the only reason for union of krewo was because of teutonic order being a threat to us . 
  you still did n't explains how commonwealth was imposed on lithuanian nobility . 
  samogitia had an autonomy , just like royal prussia , mazovia , ruthenia in poland , or livonia in commonwealth . 
  and of course polonization of samogitia took place in xvii and xviii century , and most of nobility and clergy in this land spoken polish , eventually j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski is a great example of samogitian nobility . 
  i know that russia was n't an option , but lithuania without poland would become a part of russia in xvi century . 
  and it hard to say that poland was alredy beaten when majority of lithuanian nobility remain faithfull and declare war on sweden and radziwi\u0142\u0142 . 
   still key word - elected , you can replace any dynasty with that . 
  well not really . 
  no at that time at least . 
  the first kings were elected due to their dynastic ties with jagiellons - henryk walez and stefan batory were elected as a spouse of anna jagiellonka , zygmunt iii was elected as a son of katarzyna jagiellonka . 
  after him both of his sons were elected . 
  even micha\u0142 korybut wi\u015bniowiecki was elected because of his alleged descent from gedimnas, 
   and of course boguslaw was n't a lithuanian patriot , nationalism still did n't exist back then , being lithuanian was purely geographical identity , same as being polish . 
  i 'm not talking about nationalism , i 'm not denying it was invented in xix century , but surely polish and lithuanian elites had some sense of patriotism ; it was their state , commonwealth was n't some imposed on them regime but it was their identity - respublica and its citizens was one `` corpo '' in very modern ( or classical ) sense . 
   i presume it could have helped lithuanians to finally break bonds with poles and create separate state . 
  it was imposible . 
  the union with sweden was purely virtual and ca n't stand `` the test of time '' just like polish-lithuanian-swedish union of 1592 . 
  other option for mdl was to become a province of russian czarat ; at least in union with poland lithuanian had liberty and possibility to conduction their own policy . 
  on the broader perspective there can not be independant lithuania without independant poland and it 's a historical constant , the situation was the same in 17th , 18th , 19th , 20th and in 21th century . 
   matter of perspective . 
  he was elected king , swedish descendant . 
  he was n't just swedish descendant , he was also descendant of jagiellons and through this gediminas , and that is why his father was elected king of poland and grand duke of lithuania . 
  i meant that mdl was planned to be divided between king of sweden and janusz and bogus\u0142aw radziwi\u0142\u0142 , and both of them supposed to be a vassals of carolus gustaphus . 
  it was a treason because they betrayed their rightful ruler jan kazimierz . 
  and we all know [ what happened in radnot ] ( http://m.natemat.pl/8e02665dfb6097335bddb7e69e644f6f,641,0,0,0.jpg ) and it 's hard to say that bogus\u0142aw was a lithuanian patriot . 
  well actually it was n't good option for lithuania . 
  first of all huge part of the mdl had to become a semi-independent radziwill state . 
  secondly lithuanian nobility had lost all of its liberties and self-governance, 
  wow this is some shit crazy [ biopower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biopower ) in motion, 
  so it begins ... second lithuanian empire , who is new vytautas ? 
  it was rather '' [ treason of kedainiai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv3f3crc7p0 ) '', 
  well probably next mobilization will be close to your borders , 
  well , actually you were just late , and sobieski did n't have time to wait , so forces mdl ought to stay in poland ; but not like i am underestimating your efforts , 
  yeah thx , but as you may see i 'm polish , so i know those movies very well both in original and adaptation, 
  we were trying to save europe couple time before : [ battle of legnica 1241 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_legnica ) [ battle of vorskla river 1399 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_vorskla_river ) [ battle of varna 1444 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_varna ), 
  you were late that time , 
  this movie is very bad as far as i know and there are some unbelievable historical errors , like winged husars had an 20th century polish coat of arms, 
  lol , this movie is a huge thing in poland right now  my grandma is watching this fanatically, 
  you maybe interested in [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/4rsuaa_l78a?t=800 ) ; it 's an old polish movie about war between poland and ottomans in the age before vienna, 
  well not only to them ; if you think about it france or uk did n't have any interest in the partitions of poland ... 
  i guess it would be something like [ this ] ( https://titirangistoryteller.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/underground-wedding.jpg ) ? 
  i was on couple wedding with guests from germany , they were always very enthusiastic, 
  the best action will start after midnight, 
  i 'm asking myself same question, 
  here are [ lyrics ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/hej-sokoly-hey-falcons.html ) and [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhatxwevgha ), 
  maybe that one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaefxvlfgt4 kalinka !, 
  song is about ukraine actually , 
  it 's somewhere there : https://www.google.pl/maps/place/zawiercie/@49.5359036,19.9679152,7z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x471722ffd1344f89:0x8f56a604fccf16c5!8m2!3d50.487743!4d19.4166259 it 's fairly close to cracow, 
  polan can into drinkin und weddings !, 
   hate jews [ false ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02098/j_2098067b.jpg ), 
  i want a similiar video about serbia , so we 'll know for sure . 
  interestingly kosovo is now forbidden to unite with albania , just like austria after wwi, 
  rather 40s , 
  maybe it was in some way , nevertheless kochanowski is a history professor, 
  this one is in english, 
  you know that most of the people who came in the place of germans in silesia were also by force banished of their homeland in what is now ukraine or belarus, 
  i think it 's just example of polish sense of humor, 
  it 's very useful to think that poland was lost by 17th september , exact day of soviet attack ... 
  do you know that one of the official languages of commonwealth was old belarussian ? 
  yeah of course , but it 's not historical accurate to depict every single polish side character as antisemite , and every scene involving them had antisemite context, 
  of course not , it 's clear that japan was an attacker , i meant that usa just could n't let japan to take off entire west pacific basin and at some point should intervene . 
  japan was aware of that and they decided to attack when they still had some kind of advantage, 
  if france and britain would have respond with a full force than imo su had n't attacked us, 
  usa would attack japan sooner or later, 
  well germany in the ww2 had far better chances than in the ww1, 
  it 's not fair to forget a smaller nations !, 
  exactly , thank your for this comment . 
  moreover if any german protagonist did something terribly wrong it was somehow justified , in short german characters had any sort of psychology , while polish characters acted just as irrational as it 's possible - they hated jew for just being a jew, 
  almost ? 
  i have fun having interesting conversation , is that what you have in mind ? 
  what fun ? 
  i was talking more about xix century , not about surname of her father, 
  yeah but many lithuanian surnames had polish orgins for example brazauskas is brzozowski , from `` brzoza '' ; dambrauskas is d\u0105browski from `` d\u0105browa '' and so on , there are of course polish names of lithuanian origins , like dowgia\u0142\u0142o , jagie\u0142\u0142o , pakulnis , skirgie\u0142\u0142o , staniszkis , \u017bemajtis and so on, 
  i know it a little bit , but certainly i ca n't read russian handwriting , 
  yeah exactly , it was main reason . 
  i see some ukrainian girl singing it, 
  yeah of course it does n't matter , many polish people had changed their names at some point ( stanis\u0142aw narutowicz/stanislovas narutavi\u010dius is one of many examples ) . 
  it 's just an interesting fact , that i read somewhere , and was looking for some confirmation, 
  i do n't know if it 's true , but supposedly her real family name is a polish `` grzybowska '' , and family name of her mother is n't `` korsakait\u0117 '' , but polish `` korsak '' . 
  can someone confirm or deny it ? 
  you know it was war , medieval war , worse things had happened ... 
  stop posting this kind of shit maps , mate . 
  first learn something , read some book about history of ukraine , poland , russia , eastern europe and so on , and then try to post some valuable content . 
  the map you posted is just a mixture of semi-true facts with complete bullshit , and i wo n't even comment your post about `` tetrisjugend signs '' . 
  just really , try can do better . 
  ok just exclude years 1918-20 and 43-45 add some land and it would be the same, 
  i like berlin , and the mixture of old with very modernist architecture , but i can not help feeling that quickly the other one can `` grow old '' , and as long as we are still impresed our descendents can one day find it ugly, 
  i would say germany end up pretty good . 
  in the beginning they were strugling for being considered one of the strongest nations in europe , now they are without a doubt the strongest one . 
  in 1900 they were politically isolated , right now they are the chief state of european union . 
  even the well-being of german people were through almost entire century one of the highest in europe , substantially except years 1918-20 , 29-33 and 43-45 their standard of living was on the best . 
  yeah i totally forget about this grand naval invasion of 1939 !, 
  i do n't how it 's in the case of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a . 
  but as to cracovia they ultras are not ashamed of their jewish idendity or rather jewish past . 
  one of the ultras group is calling themselves the `` jude gang '' , try to google `` cracovia jude gang '' , there is [ their emblem ] ( http://orig12.deviantart.net/7829/f/2014/365/8/f/cracovia___jude_gang______by_gieeny-d8bzqj7.jpg ) , and [ the supporters ] ( https://sportowacracovia.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/2011-12-06-121905.jpg ) . 
  do you have some instructions ? 
  you are so experienced, 
  why you did n't show a t-84 oplto m ? 
  it 's such a magnificent tank, 
  yeah i know , it must be a mistake , they are saying about ukrainian liberation army but no such oganization exists in y 1917-19,
