   it is . 
  so we can call aushwitz as a jewish death camp ? 
  let me quote t. gordon ash : `` watching a german television news report on the trial of john demjanjuk a few weeks ago , i was amazed to hear the announcer describe him as a guard in `` the polish extermination camp sobibor '' . 
  what times are these , when one of the main german tv channels thinks it can describe nazi camps as `` polish '' ? 
  in my experience , the automatic equation of poland with catholicism , nationalism and antisemitism -- and thence a slide to guilt by association with the holocaust -- is still widespread . 
  this collective stereotyping does no justice to the historical record '' - that 's what i 'm talking about, 
  do n't tell me what 's my problem , k mate ? 
  how you can say that i do n't suffer ? 
  i know how adjectives works , and i know that they can have different qualites , and one of them is posession . 
  we could call them `` jewish death camp '' since the jews were the majority of prisoners . 
  it should be fine it 's just an adjective . 
  answer to my question is `` no reason '' . 
  and it 's my problem , i 'm polish and historian and i care about truth and historical correctness . 
  but why anyone would want to emphasize a geographical location of said camps in a some article about holocaust ? 
  the problems is that german camps in occupied poland are actively called `` polish camps '' . 
  and do n't worry if you call them that in everyday conversation you wo n't be persecuted, 
  it 's far more complicated than that . 
  most germans in the tv series are portrayed as filo-semitic innocent victims of the war with complicated natures , while all of polish people are one-dimensionals characters with high anti-semitic bias . 
  the whole show is just an internal german propaganda . 
  sigismund lost only smolensk and overall wars with russia till 1648 was very succesful for poland , especially northern wars during reign of sigismund ii and batory . 
  the peace with tk and creation od prussia was probably the best thing to do , it 's a bit more complicated but it 's really hard to demolish country which officaly is fief of both pope and kaiser . 
  poland never waged offensive wars against turks , in polish sphere of interest were only romanian duchies , especially moldavia , and poland lost control of it in late 16th century . 
  i agree with you that first symptomps of later decline were visible at that time but still poland was one of the strongest powers in this part of the world . 
  do n't be silly . 
  you would call japenese camps in china a `` chinese camps '' just because some lost tourist may want to visit them ? 
  if someone want to visit auschwitz should first check it on google where it is . 
  and what on earth someone would want to emphasize the geographical location ? 
  why it 's so important ? 
  i know that for some of you it may sound ridiculous and probably most people wich are using this pharse do n't have anything bad in mind . 
  but srsly anyone would call japenese camps in china a `` chinese camp '' ? 
  rather not , think about it, 
  i think it 's really cool , 
  are you trying to [ trick us again ] ( http://static1.menstream.pl/i/art/45/288301_big.jpg ) ? 
  you are wrong . 
  what about glorious days of two sigismunds ? 
  what about succesful reign of stephen batory ? 
  and wars with moscov and sweden during vasa reign ? 
  poland was a strong power until 1648 . 
  latvia never was glorious ? 
  what about their mighty [ overseas empire ] ( http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/the%20baltic%20states/kurlandskolonien_files/image013.jpg ) ? 
  polskie obozy \u015bmierci translate as `` polish death camps '' , and obozy \u015bmierci w polsce translate as `` death camps in poland '' , the difference is the same in english and in polish, 
  our mothers , our fathers i believe he refering to, 
  it was god 's will !, 
  i know that old-saxon is an indo-european language , what i meant is that some word , even do sound similar , are not derived one from another , but are rooted in proto-indo-european language . 
  til ; one question more : is `` ponas '' derived from polish `` pan '' or have some indo-european roots , as far as i know polish `` pan '' is from old-saxonic `` fan '' . 
  polish eqivalent of `` tamsta '' was probably `` waszmo\u015b\u0107 '' which literally means `` wasza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 '' ( `` yours grace '' ) and could abbrievated to `` wa\u015b\u0107 '' , `` wasze\u0107 '' or `` wa\u0107 '' , there existed longer version `` wa\u0107pan '' - `` wasza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 pan '' ( yours grace lord/sir ) , sometimes shortened to `` acan/asan/a \u015b\u0107 '' . 
  a noble man in poland could be also named as `` mi\u0142o\u015bciwy pan '' ( gracious/lord ) and it was abbreviated to `` mo\u015bci pan '' , `` mospan '' , `` mosan '' , sometimes `` mopanek '' . 
  another form was `` jego mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 '' ( his grace ) abbreviated to `` jegomo\u015b\u0107 '' and to most popular `` im\u0107 '' . 
  was it used as a name of noble man , member of `` szlachta '' ( in lit . 
  \u0161l\u0117kta i believe ) ? 
  how kind , you even give me wikipedia link , how sweet, 
  polan can into helping, 
  how is `` pan '' in lithuanian ? 
  rzplita *, 
  there is joke , how to make poland a wealthy country in one day : 1 . 
  declare war on germany 2 . 
  surrender, 
  the longest genocide in human history, 
  10 hours later : still no idea, 
  that 's what i thought,

  bulgarians do n't want to fight for their homeland ? 
  why ? 
  why canada is so high on the list ? 
  is it due to large ukrainian minority or some other reasons ? 
  i have no idea what you just said, 
  lol . 
  you are funny 1 . 
  poland and ukraine where fighting together in 1920-21 that 's the [ fact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_warsaw_ ( 1920 ) ) 2 . 
  uon was higghly influenced by fascism and rascist views ; another fact 3 . 
  uon was n't first and only organization fighting for ukrainian independence . 
  unbelievable, 
  the problem is , that he was laughing first, 
  not ukraine , but fascist and racist organization called uon/upa . 
  i 'm tired explaining this shit to people which obviously have zero knowledge on this topic . 
  the goal of this war was to create independent ukrainian state, 
  yeah sure , propably that is why we have all these catholic terrorists, 
  so basically you are saying that there was no way to prevent this kind of attack ? 
  that there was nobody who could influence on this kid ? 
  i hope so . 
  poland and lithuania are stuck with each other , 
  thx for response . 
  i was familiar with this , i mean i know that political representation of polish minority has a pro-russian stance . 
  i understand the whole thing about language exam , but as far as i know couple years ago polish kids had far less hours of lithuanian language than kinds in lithuanian schools , so it was quite understandable that poles wanted to have better chance to past exam . 
  but as i understand today it 's not a problem . 
  even though this does not change my mind on the spelling of polish names, 
  6 % of people is not a small number . 
  i think in regular society there is less percentage of blind people and still we do any effort to make their lifes easier . 
  and in reality the letters are not a problem ; the problem is forced lituanization of polish names . 
  and i think that most of the human rights are not `` practical '' but yet we still are preserving them . 
  and what about russia ? 
   only 6 % of population only 6 % of population ? 
  seriously ? 
  and you know that there are parts of lithuania that consists of 50-60 % of polish people ? 
  and of course it would be a sign of good will and respect for basic human right with only a minimum effort . 
  i can install lithuanian letters on my computer in a second . 
  and no one need to use second keyboard since you can use virtual one . 
  i do n't what is a real reason behind it , but surely not technological one . 
  for me , and it 's only my opinion , i do n't know the stance of poles in lithuania on this topic , it 's a sign of lithuanization . 
  in any other country of european union person with a foreign name can keep this name or change it to its polish equivalent according to ** his will ** , same his/her spouse , kids and so on .
