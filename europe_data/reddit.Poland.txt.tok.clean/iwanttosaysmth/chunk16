  you obviously do n't know anything about history of poland or ukraine . 
  i do n't get why you think czarniecki is a mass murderer ? 
  do you know anything that justify this opinion ? 
  so please share it with me , because i do n't have any clue . 
  also when on earth ak had killed `` thousands of people '' ? 
  please give exact numbers and name this crimes acts . 
  most of polish war crimes were commited by nsz and nzw , two organizations totally independent from ak . 
  i will not comment anything what you just said about pilsudski , because you are just making fool of yourself . 
  ca n't you just tell me ? 
  you propably means bucovina and carpath rus, 
  omfg no . 
  the problem is that solely reason that banderites upa exists was to kill citizens in volhynia and galicia - jews , poles , even ukrainians . 
  sure there were fighting with soviets , but mostly they were killing innocent people and were fighting with other ukrainian partizans - borowe\u0107 for example . 
  even in prewar poland only bandera 's accomplishments were several terrorist attacks and assasinations , and most of the victims were ukrainians . 
  really banderites upa were just criminal organization nothing more , nothing else . 
  why ? 
  in 1939 soviet union annexed western parts of poland so both western and eastern ukraine were united in one country . 
  propably somewhere between the amount of people that pilsudski had killed and 20 mln . 
  do not relativized , stalin was a murderer and a leader of the criminal ideology , pilsudski was the head of the state like hundreds of others . 
  i wonder what are the sources of this map ? 
  i mean its very detailed and it can imagine any reliable xvi century source that can provide such detailed data . 
  they are in their homeland . 
  these are their names . 
  deal with it and move on , just try to be bigger than that . 
   which is - bandera fought for independent ukraine , which would be rich and democratic as european countries . 
  bandera was dilusional if he had thought that germans would have given real independance to ukrainians . 
  it was never near to be real , imo maximum what they could got would be similiar to ustashi croatia . 
  just look here : https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4u8eb6/intermarium_federal_state_of_eastern_european/, 
  they are in their homeland so they have any reason to use names of their ancestors . 
  just like anywhere in the world . 
  `` did hire '' members of prewar lietuvos szauliu sajunga nad members of ypatingasis b\u016brys took active role in the killings . 
  and i mean that they were just killing jews , poles and others . 
  but you are doing this . 
  i mean members of banderites upa were nothing more than murderers and bandits , they killed more polish , jewish and even ukrainian citizens than soviet soldiers ( i 'm not even mentioning germans since they almost never were fighting with them , they even were fighting more with other ukrainians partizans than with germans ) . 
  so please do n't ever compare ak with banderites , ak was really huge army ( almost 400k soldiers ) , and while not every akowiec was a saint , there surely were some among them - witold pilecki , aleksander kami\u0144ski , jan karski and many others . 
  while banderites were just bandits . 
  and do n't get me wrong i 'm not saying that 2ww there were n't any great ukrainians hereos or great persons , tara bulba borowe\u0107 is one of many , i 'm saying that upa was just a criminal orginazation . 
  only known to me polish crime on lithuanians citizens during 2ww is dubinki/dubingiai massacre where around 27 lithuanians had died . 
  can you provide me with other examples ? 
  while in ponary alone 100k of polish citizen were killed , among them at least 20k ethnic poles ( for me this distinction is not important , for me polish jews were poles ) . 
  so for me is bullshit when someone is saying that  both poles and lithuanians were on-par during wwii . 
  both in good and bad deeds . 
  it 's not even close to be equal !, 
  its 27 deaths against 100k . 
  i mean yesterday 10 people were killed by some lunatic who were acting alone . 
  edit : spelling, 
  let 's clarify we wo n't tolerate any black-red flags or any upa/banderites symbols in poland , if it happens you can expect some `` anti-ukrainian '' sentiments . 
  what about szaulisi ? 
  this formation did n't do anything except killing poles and jews , yet they are worshiped on lithuania . 
  while ak was the biggest underground army in europe , they prepared and conducted the biggest uprising in the that time ( akcja burza and warsaw uprising ) , they were part of biggest underground state in the europe and constantly made diversionary actions against germans . 
  and it 's just armia krajowa i did n't even mention polish forces outside the homeland . 
  yes there was massacres commited by polish soldiers . 
  but main difference is that their were never approved or ordered by higher command . 
  i can provide you several documents which are explictly saying to not take any actions against citizens . 
  on the other hand its known fact that upa antipolish actions were approved and propably commanded by general staff . 
  my lithuanina friend should i remind you about [ ponary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponary_massacre ) where germans and lithuanians killed around 100k of polish citizens - jews and poles ? 
  or about szaulisi , which took huge part in jewish pogroms , anti-polish actions , and were active in jewish ghettos ? 
  stalin killed 20 mln people, 
   he also became a great military commander later on ** and ** actually won in the end . 
  but you know that russia ** never ** held entire ukraine before 1939 ? 
  for one positive opinion of bury or ogie\u0144 you can find 10 negative, 
  i think that you are very optimistic . 
  he now has averything - press , army , courts and what 's more important populat vote . 
  ha , i live there !, 
  meh i was expecting something like : '' ... and there will be no fourth ! '', 
   i can quote wikipedia that quotes him atm if you 'd like it . 
  yeah sure why not . 
   exactly why i want an investigation . 
  i find it hard to believe that there was as much cruelty as people say there was . 
  like some guy just said that babies were nailed to walls . 
  you have got to be a fucking retarded psychopath to do something that fucked up . 
  sadly it is true . 
  there are numerous testimonies which describe it very well . 
  i do not where so much cruelty is coming from to a man , but history give us numerous similiar examples . 
  just look at a tutsi genocide for a comparison . 
  i guess upa wanted to spread a fear among polish people so they will escape volhyn , eventually their goal was to build a polish-free ukraine ; they did n't have resources or infrastructure to achieve through massive expulsions , but they have a will to do it in the most cruel way, 
  there is also a third rome ... 
  i am not a biologist , but in my opinion nature would in this case create some kind of animal , who would eat this giant creature and thus prevent it to spread to much, 
  the real face of today 's hungary, 
  but you know that syndicalists have nothing to do with marxism ? 
  marx was a fierce enemy of syndycalism . 
  i 'm not saying that fasicism have nothing to do with leftism , or socialiast political spectrum , but marxism have nothing to do with fasicism because of exactly same reason you mentioned, 
  i would go even further ... you are wrong , from a numerous reason . 
  first of them is that corporationism , the so called `` thrid way '' have nothing to do with marxist theory, 
  so you are one of the guys that think volhynian massacre was justified ??? 
  for me it was just effect of nationalistic infection , nothing more . 
  volhynian massacre was a savage no doubt about that , i am not sure how exactly it is perceived in ukraine but i often read comments on reddit that it was justfied people 's reaction to attrocites commited by pilsudski . 
  welcome in neoliberal world, 
  yeah but still it is a treaty about state , smith is one of the investors of a science called political economy . 
  i would even say that smith created a marxist discourse, 
  yeah moreover he is the most contemporary xix century thinker , which theories can be applied to today 's society . 
  and you can say this about only couple other figures weber , nietzsche , maybe kant or kierkegaard , others such as durkheim , malinowski , freud , hegel are considered not paradigmatic in contemporary science , even can be said about comte, 
  what you mean by that ? 
  first of all i was n't saying marx and smith are the same , i was just saying that capital and wealthy of nations are probably two most commented book that almost nobody read . 
  secondly smith is maybe respected as a historical thinkers but he is not perceived as man whose theory can be applied to today 's society and it 's economy . 
  i. . . must seize ... 
  these means ... of ... 
  production !!, 
  we i can not post entire movie also this scene is one of the best, 
  not only by polish authors .
