  i really was expecting something more like shadenfreude, 
  vilnius has many prime examples of baroque architecture , so it might be this, 
   g\u00e1sp\u00e1r bekes really he is that well-known in lithuania ? 
  hi iceland , you want to exchange invasions ? 
  great aliyah of 1990 - in 1989 mikhail gorbachov ended restrictions on jewish immigration , so around 1 milion of soviet jews decided to leave collapsing soviet union . 
  israel and usa were eager to help them to get to erec . 
  crucial part of this operation had to be poland . 
  it was also very important for polish-israeli relation which were renewed after period of broken relationships after 6-day war . 
  so polish prime minister after talk with president of american jewish congress decided to create special unit ( which later became known as grom ) which in cooperation with cia and mosad created an airlift from moscow via warsaw to israel . 
  over few months through warsaw airport around 100 thousands of jews were transfered to israel in constant threat of terrorist attack . 
  in fact at least one bomb attack was prevented by polish forces , and later polish diplomats in beirut were attacked . 
  also in the same year polish intelligence held a so called [ operation simoom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_simoom ) to withdrew from iraq six american operatives investigating iraqi troops movements in iraq before the gulf war . 
  as a reward for poland 's help , the us government promised to cancel half , or $ 16.5 billion , of poland 's foreign debt . 
  lol not even close ; only 14 %, 
  i think that 1/3 of ukrainians in poland wants to stay here , 1/3 wants to go futher west , the rest wants to go back home, 
  i agree with you . 
  there are even some historians who argue that jagiello was more connected with lithuania than poland throughout his entire rule . 
  considering that he was heirless almost to his end this might be true . 
  even after great war with teutonic knights he did n't do much to annex at least gda\u0144sk and pomeralia to poland , but he secure the well being of lithuania and annexed samogitia ( or vytuatas , does not matter , they were working togther ) . 
  he totally forget about silesia and other old polish lands . 
  every israel prime minister was born in poland and his first language was polish, 
  many ukrainians are prasing our roads or public transporation ... i mean , really ? 
  imo many ukrainians word are similiar to polish archais forms , for example polish `` fate '' is `` los '' , while ukrainian is `` dola '' , word wich we can find in polish word `` niedola '' ( misfortune , bad luck ) . 
  beautiful archcitecture have no ethnicity, 
  we had wars with moscow since 15th century ( alongside lithuanians ) but since 18th century we were weaker site and start to losing, 
  probably there would have been some planned destruction . 
  warsaw city center was very crowded and very narrow in the era of high traffic that would n't be enough . 
  prewar warsaw was outpopulated , almost 2 milion people was living in relatively small space , the reason was the russian restrictions , before 1906 warsaw was a fortified city , sourounded by forts . 
  also only around 1-2 % of prewar warsaw was a communal property , so city administration did not have enough possibilites to change the city in the interwar era, 
  more details ? 
  link ? 
  what referendum ?

  countrywise afaik , september 2016, 
  translation : how do you describe your feelings towards following countries ? 
  poland , belarus , eu , georgia , canada , lithuania , usa , germany , moldau , turkey , russia . 
  legend : very good , good , neutral , bad , very bad, 
  our nobles ? 
  most of the nobles in commonwealth were of lithuanian and ruthenian origins ; i guess only lubomirski and zamoyski were polish and had estates in the east, 
  you said :  poles loved to impose their language , culture , religion nobody was imposing it , polish kingdom did not pursue policy of forced polonisation , what your statement implied, 
   true , that 's the reason why khmelnytsky uprising happened , poles loved to impose their language , culture , religion . 
  always when i see lithuanian flag near to username i know there will be shitting on poland, 
  they are now far more right than last time they were rulling ; the whole thing with total abortion ban is the best example, 
  yeah i heard about that ; but they were persecuted because they want to klaipeda return to germany , not because they were nazis , and three death penalties ? 
  it 's a bit too much i guess . 
   you probably do n't know but we were first nation prosecute nazis and their ideology which led to imprisonment of them . 
  what ? 
  what you mean by that ? 
  after the war ? 
  when ? 
  of course not like everywhere else , maybe only in estonia afaik ; 1,5 million of lithuanians killed 220 thousands of jews in three months , that 's unbelievable , yet it 's true, 
  they ruled when lithuanians were killing jews , and their actions did not help for sure in saving jewish community , but that does not matter my point was involvement of lithuanians society in persecution of jews, 
   lietuvos aktyvist\u0173 frontas `` laf is a controversial organization because of its anti-semitic [ 3 ] and anti-polish [ 1 ] views and overall collaboration with the nazi germany . 
  for example , laf 's manifesto-type essay `` what are the activists fighting for ? '', 
  states : `` the lithuanian activist front , by restoring the new lithuania , is determined to carry out an immediate and fundamental purging of the lithuanian nation and its land of jews ... '' . 
  [ 4 ] when the june uprising began in the polish-majority vilnius region , the laf committed many atrocities ( rapes , murders , pillage ) ; even the germans referred to their `` allies '' as `` organized robbers '' . 
  [ 1 ] also , a number of laf government acts discriminated against jews , one notable example being '' \u017dyd\u0173 pad\u0117ties nuostatai '' ( english : regulation on status of jews ) . 
  laf however did not support and unsuccessfully attempted to stop a pogrom organized by algirdas klimaitis in vilijampol\u0117 . 
  i was talking about lietuvos aktyvist\u0173 frontas , they were active in july , august and september , in period when most of the jews were killed . 
  they formed even a provisional governement . 
  and of course local administration , church and other institutions were still active in lithuania during war . 
  most of the facts are from interviews with ruta vanagaite and snyder 's books . 
  it 's well known facts , but it do n't surprise me you do n't know about it, 
   your government after pilsudski 's death was really push over on it too . 
  so it was our fault ? 
  and do n't even try to justify it . 
  they all wanted jewish properties , wealth and so on . 
  and i hate words like '' \u017eyd\u0161aud\u017eiai '' it always easy to blame those who pulled a trigger . 
  same in ponary , sure there was maybe less than hundred man , but we all know that it could n't happen if your central governement , local governement , church and other institutions did not support these methods . 
  also there must have been a general permission to kill all the jews , without it nothing could happen . 
  lol germans even import jews to lithuania because you were so good at killing them , lithuanian troops were send to eastern poland , wilno for example , to kill jews there . 
  it was the same bullshit like in volhynia and galicia , where ukrainians had killed jews first than started to kill polish people . 
  50 or 100 men get their hands dirty , in this one massacre . 
  but we all know that in three summer months of 1941 around 220 thousands of lithuanian jews were killed mostly by thousands ethnic lithuanians . 
  it was 10 % of prewar population of lithuania , as you pointed out before the state which took care of its minorites . 
  i guess lithuanians did everything to avoid sending jews to aushwitz ... 
  one thing everyone should admit , lithuanians knows how to resolve [ ethnic conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponary_massacre ), 
  lol , you did it too , i do n't know how you can blame us . 
  what land grabbing ? 
  you wanted to [ grab lands where your were n't even a minority ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/rzeczpospolita_lithuania_claims.png/275px-rzeczpospolita_lithuania_claims.png ) . 
  you conquered memel , where only 25 % of population were lithuanian . 
  you would grab more if your were n't just weak and unable to create significant army . 
  only in [ three voivodoships polish people were n't in majority , but every were there at least 15 % of polish poeple ] ( http://polska1918-89.pl/photos/demografia-w-ii-rp,2149.jpg ) . 
  and polish eastern border was resolved in 1920 , when we and url become allies . 
  at least those ukrainians who lived in poland did n't die in holodomor . 
  you said strong poland = exploiting others and honetly what you mean by exploiting others ? 
  of course not , i think that poland is pretty strong now and we do not exploit anybody, 
  can you blame them ? 
  there is also another thing , that in poland was seen as a slap in the face . 
  right after polish president komorowski had a speech in ukrainian parliament the same body passed so called `` history laws '' which prohibited any kind of denying role of upa in fighting for independence . 
  srsly what they were trying to achieve ? 
  it was very surprising for everyone in poland, 
  hahah , dmowski right hand of pilsudski , a good one , srsly read some books . 
   he argued strenuously against the minority rights treaty forced on poland by the allies . 
  he was kinda right though . 
  because almost every country in europe had significant minorites and only poland was forced to sign minority rights treaty . 
   there was a hundred years history during which poles killed thousands of ukrainians basing on their nationality . 
  yeah sure ; and upa murders butchered infants because in 16-something some wi\u015bniowiecki or other lubomirski was bad for ukrainian peasants or cossacks ... are you lunatic ? 
  the truth is that oun-upa killed far more ukrainians than any polish force in the same period . 
   you should not also forget what did your `` armia krajowa '' : you call it `` payback '' - we call it muss murders of ukrainians .
