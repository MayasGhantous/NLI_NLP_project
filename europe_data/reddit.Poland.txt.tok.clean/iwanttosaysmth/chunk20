  lol, 
  why so ?

  you know that we are in a kaczy\u0144ski 's mind, 
  ask kaczy\u0144ski , but he does not like you right now, 
  hahaha , i do n't understand a thing, 
  why i did n't know about this ? 
  niemiecczyzna is a fancy word for a german language , or the german-speaking aream , just like polszczyzna , francuszczyzna , angielszczyzna , though w\u0142oszczyzna is something really different, 
  vistrovych is impostor , who often cite sources known only to him ; nobody in poland have nothing against ukrainian heroes , we just do n't like war criminals , that 's all, 
  but both sich and hetmanate was dismantle in the late 18th century , so he is cleary speaking about don and kuban cossacks , who were part of russian army sine early 17th century, 
  i hope some day you will realise how retarted is what you are saying, 
  well killing jews was a returning theme for all the `` rebirths of ukraine '' - chmielnicki , petlura , upa ... 
  and hitler did n't know , he was in berlin !, 
  i guess it 's from the period of italian wars, 
  it was centralized more than kingdom of france at that time, 
  it was n't called holy at that time, 
  we were best in belgrade , 12 medals - 7 gold ; also we won team world championship in ski jumping !!,

  almost every museum in the world has couple times more artefacts in storage than on display , though i think green ones are very high in that ranking, 
  of course not . 
  for example ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz , inventor and petroleum industry pioneer was never considered russian , also bronia sister of maria who came back to poland was n't some `` nurse '' but a doctor of medicine, 
   another example we could debate born in former gdl lands , publicly stated that he is lithuanian ( so either lithuanian or belarusian ) . 
  why insist he is polish ? 
  because he wrote in polish ? 
  a lot of old pieces were wrote in latin but that did n't make the author 's latin . 
  same should be applied here . 
  this person should be regarded as belarusian ( or at least lithuanian in broader sense ) and not polish lol . 
  do you read anything mickiewicz wrote ? 
  like for example `` ksi\u0119gi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego '' ( books of polish nation and polish pilgrimage ) ?? 
  so basically you argue that he was russian ? 
   ( we stick with their pagan names , you use christian names ) nobody in poland is arguing that vytautas should be called alexander, 
  to be honest at that time it was called often just `` kingdom of poland '' or `` republic of poland '', 
  are you talking about jan borowski ? 
  i like discuss history , but you are talking on another level, 
  waste of time, 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  you know i am talking about polish-soviet war ? 
  you are little a man ; i 'm sorry to say that , but all what you are saying just proves it, 
  in 2025 we will have 500 anniversary of [ its creation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_homage ), 
  hi this bavaria this my [ goal ] ( https://goo.gl/images/nlkwwg ) !!!!, 
  ( pls do n't annex me ), 
   we did wanted to take over non-lithuanian territories , i never denied that , which unlike you who try to justify that it held polish minorities so it must belong to poland ( e.g. 
  ukrainian , belarusian case ) . 
  lol man seriously . 
  i was just stating the fact that in those lands actualy some polish people were living in significant numbers . 
  i was just pointing out the difference between polish and lithuanian expansionism . 
   you said you lost the war ? 
  so why did they respect the borders then ? 
  the did n't . 
  check out what happened in 39 . 
  more over polish-soviet border was a place of constant conflict , soviets were supporting revolutionary organisation within poland . 
  plus read some books , the concept of soviet policy had changed , they abandoned policy of immediate export of revolution in favor of `` socialism in one country '' . 
   in your eyes , not others . 
  so how the scenario would look like in your eyes ? 
  poland is collapsing , latvia and estonia become soviet republics , soviets are approaching germany , where another revolution breaks out ... and what is happening with lithuania ?? 
   the territory belong to german empire , but people inhabiting it were n't always german . 
  this is the most stupid argument . 
  mazurians were once polish but at the time they were feeling more german . 
  nationality is n't genetic . 
   there are always two sides of the coin . 
  so what 's the other in this case ? 
   with soviet russia out of the picture due to peace treaty poland became number one . 
  you cann ' t be serious saying that russia would respect any peace treaty when their goal was to export communism abroad and regain old borders ? 
   what was point of your comment other than show up that poland somehow magically saved lithuania . 
  i talked about lithuanian and german ( spec . 
  saxon ) soldiers who fought for lithuanian freedom , poland and their army did n't fight for lithuanian freedom , they fought for their own , why should i feel obligated to be thankful ? 
  i never insist on you to be thankful . 
  i was just stating geopolitical fact that without defeat of soviet troops in poland the soviet-lithuanian peace treaty would mean nothing . 
   true , but there is no denial that lithuanian language was spoken by majority in vilnius region in middle ages . 
   sounds like typical apologism . 
  well it is truth . 
  many was n't friendly towards ukrainians ( dmowski for example ) , but pi\u0142sudski was on the other side . 
   so coup d'tat did n't happen ? 
  polish-lithuanian war did n't happen ? 
  is that what you 're trying to say to me ? 
  you did n't talk shit about lithuania in paris peace conf . 
  like that we would n't survive as a small nation ? 
  jesus , get off your high horse . 
  yes this is all truth . 
  but you can not admit that lithuania was n't `` angelic state '' . 
   do you even known existance of lithuania minor ( kleinlitauen ) ? 
  of course i do . 
  what 's your point ? 
   never heard of it , enlighten me . '', 
  in september 1919 , during attack against the soviets , lithuanian army occupied much of il\u016bkste municipality and threatened to take daugavpils as well . 
  between late august and early september , 1920 latvian army pushed lithuanians out . '', 
   we were not their allies and it 's not surprise we had short sighted anti-polish view when you were our second biggest threat to independence , you tried coup d'tat and now were fighting in open conflict . 
  yeah , that 's my point ** the second biggest one **  and brining polish `` heroism '' into talks about german and lithuanian fight against soviet russia is not small minded nationalism ? 
  please . 
  i 'm not talking about polish `` heroism '' i 'm talking about political situation of that time , and it is that if soviets would defeat poland , independence of lithuania would be very short . 
   yes they were . 
  unless you know better than all the historians and lingustics scientists ? 
  yeah i might be wrong about memelland . 
  and every time i see [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png/800px-lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png ) on reddit i cringe . 
  you can not draw so detailed map of any european language of that time , not even french or germany , about which history we have far more sources than about lithuanian . 
   which you failed and just split the territories to yourself and soviet russia instead of keeping your original plan . 
  poland annexed non polish lands , no excuse on it , you blame lithuanians for wanting non-lithuanian lands , while keeping blind eye . 
  kettle calling pot black . 
  yes we failed , but we did n't split .
