  because against whom ? 
  koliwszczyzna was against nobility , in 1943 there was almost in volhynia , their houses were ploundred earlier and they fled region or died in attacks , also polish officers , intelligentsia , clergy , clerks and so on were deported or killed by soviets , or to lesser extent by by germans . 
  victims of upa were peasant , mostly kids , women , older people ; because all others were deported , killed or fighting in polish army . 
  cows are fun, 
  well it should be kr\u00f3lewiec , just to settle the differences, 
  tim snyder :  ukrainians in the german auxiliary police in volhynia collaborated in the final solution throughout november 1942 . 
  in march and april 1943 , they provided the bulk of the recruits for the oun-b 's new partisan army , the upa . 
  the oun-b had directed its men to the police in 1941 , as its task forces followed the wehrmacht through ukraine . 
  in 1942 , as the numbers of auxiliary police increased to meet the demands of the final solution , the oun-b agitated among them : ` when there are five germans and fifty [ ukrainian ] militiamen , who has power ? 
  in 1943 , the oun-b was able to extract its men , and bring many of the police along with them . 
  they had been taught how to kill . 
  former policemen brought not only their ss training and their weapons , but the irreplaceablexperience of co-ordinated murder of designated populations . 
  the oun-b appealed directly to this experience , and to the widely held idea that the ukrainians were next : ` the germans use every method to beat us down , and then later do with us what they did with the jews . 
  we are not jews and we will not die a jewish death . 
  as i rembeber for first couple hours people were very serious about it , my comments were downvoted . 
  i guess it all changed late sunday morning, 
  any other example ? 
  deus vult to make more babies, 
  seems like you can post some random picture , made up some stupid title and suddenly you get over 1000 upvotes and top place on main site . 
   calling ukranians nazis we ca n't compare situation in ukraine with that thread . 
  i 'm not saying that ukraine is nazi-state of course it is n't , i think they are at a highway towards liberal democracy , but nobody can deny that nazi symbolism was used by some units ( azov ) ; and upa symbolism was present during protests , maidan and so on . 
  lithuania : `` so you are basically samogitians ? '', 
  ukraine : `` so we are in ** the ** ukraine ? '', 
  belarus : `` are you russians ? '', 
  russia : `` i heard that russia was the first hitler 's ally '' slovakia : `` so you are eastern czechia or upper hungary ? '', 
  did you just justified german rascist policy ? 
  what about croatia , romania , bulgaria , ukrainians , they did n't have so high percentage of `` light hair '' . 
   contrary they wanted to use us a a weapon on exterminating poles and jews , given our ever growing hatred towards them during interwar period ( note poles ) and soviet occupation ( note lithuanian jews were sympathizers of soviets ) , so they targeted only jews and slavs . 
  lithuanians were very willing to do it , your compatriotes basically killed 95 % of all lithuanian jews during three-four months , and we are talking about population of 200k jews in a 2mln nation . 
  fasces original meaning was a ful imperium - full sovereignty and legal authority , so it 's rather natral that it is and was used by a police depertments , courts , legislatives and so on, 
  bandera was german agent from early 30s till his death, 
  any examples ? 
  im just curious, 
  r/history maybe ? 
  no it is n't . 
  latin phrases are used in numerous place and occasions , it does not prove anything, 
  because it was over 20 years ago , croatia was waging a war , so naturally ultra-nationalistic views and smybols were emerging . 
  op suggusted that croatian army , member of nato were using nazi symbolism, 
  [ waffen-ss historical reconstruction ] ( http://odkrywca.pl/forum_pics/picsforum19/eee_copy1.jpg ) [ same , market garden ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vcyut76.jpg ) [ ukraine , 70th anniversary of ss-galizien ] ( http://9.s.dziennik.pl/pliki/5229000/5229034-ss-galizien-galicja-ukraina-643-456.jpg ), 
  but you dont understand . 
  their logic is like that lathin phrase  ancient romans  fascism . 
  they just claiming because it was a latin phrase it makes all of it more fascist beacuse italian fascists were using roman iconography , not this one particular , but other also . 
  it 's just non-sense, 
   by largely uneducated former peasants driven to the edge and here you are wrong . 
  massacres were conducted by members of upa which were earlier soldiers of german-allied ukrainian units . 
  this is some kind of myth that it was a `` second koliwszczyzna '' . 
  thx man . 
  i did not know what to do with the rest of the night, 
  i know all of them shukhevych , klym savur , stetsko and others . 
  i think we despise all of them . 
   one day upa would come and destroy a polish village , the next day ak would slaughter a ukrainian one . 
  well in volhynia it would be like ukrainians destroyed 50 polish villages , polish troops one ... 
  bandera was also collaborating later , and the real `` enemy '' of upa at least until 1945 were just polish peasants , and they adopted the slogan as their official gretting ( along with the roman salut ) ; so for it 's just obvious, 
  yes and it was very alive in weimar republic . 
  suprisingly hitler was first german leader for a long time who did not questioned poland 's right to existence . 
  all we know for sure that sign was created in 1994 , thing is we do not if it is still in use, 
  im not really sure how it is relevant, 
  exactly . 
  both uk and usa in 1938-39 were practically defensless with totally pacifist population , yen in couple years they created one of the biggest army of all time and changed their economy to totally war-oriented, 
  polish nation or state is mentioned couple times in mein kampf , and do not think that hitler in his works ex he criticise foreign policy of wiemar republic :  the foreign policy of the reich in the matter of alliances was an example of shilly-shally . 
  they wished to maintain peace , but in doing so they steered straight . 
  into war . 
   their polish policy was also carried out by half-measures . 
  it resulted neither in a german triumph nor polish conciliation , and it made enemies of the russians . 
  in other place he is saying that germany can not make an alliance with poland , but he was thinking at that time that germans do n't have any natural ally in europe :  anyone who can not rise to the level of this outlook must reflect that otherwise there would remain nothing else than to renounce the idea of adopting any policy of alliances for the future . 
  for if we can not form an alliance with england because she has robbed us of our colonies , or with italy because she has taken possession of south tyrol , or with poland or czechoslovakia , then there remains no other possibility of an alliance in europe except with france which , inter alia , has robbed us of alsace and lorraine . 
  another passage :  unfortunately , a policy towards poland , whereby the east was to be germanized , was demanded by many and was based on the same false reasoning . 
  here again it was believed that the polish people could be germanized by being compelled to use the german language . 
  the result would have been fatal . 
  a people of foreign race would have had to use the german language to express modes of thought that were foreign to the german , thus compromising by its own inferiority the dignity and nobility of our nation . 
  of course for hitler polish people were always inferior to germans , but at that time he was far from calling them `` untermenschen '' . 
  as i said before tacitus quote has nothing to do with fascism , it 's just a nice sounding latian phrase . 
  but i ca n't agree with you on sign itself , it 's cleary ss-symbol and its connotations are obvious and it shoudl n't be used in any miltary . 
  as to a croatian call . 
  we can compare with ukrainian motto `` slava ukrayini !, 
  which was used by pronazi upa . 
  for me , as pole , it 's outrageous when it 's used by people today, 
  yeah i also have doubts what is the reason behind this post ; op is not able to provide any reliable sources proving his statements , i do not know croatian so i am not able to check if this unit is still a part of croatian military . 
  but i believe that somewhere in internet should be some kind of information or list . 
  he did n't even said anything bad about poles ( especially with comparison with earlier rulers of weimar republic ) until late 1938/early 1939 when his offer of alliance were ultimately rejected on polish side ; then suddenly poland once again become `` saisonstaat '' , `` versaille 's bastard '' , and polish people `` untermenschen '', 
  i guess they are just wehraboo, 
  i doubt it is a contemporary picture or this unit is really a part of croatian army . 
  unit `` satnija taktickich snajpera '' was active during croatian war of independence ( 1991-1995 ) , and only pictures of this sign that we could find in internet are from that period, 
   saying : `` ubi solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' which is common in italian facists im not familiar with this saying being associated with italian fascism even your sources is not claiming this :  radi se o rimskoj izreci , a poznato je da su ** talijanski fa\u0161isti preuzeli svoju ikonografiju od rimljana **, 
  of course you can . 
  hitler builded germany war machine in 4-5 years . 
  you really just need to stop making bmws and start making leopards, 
  is it really contemporary ? 
  it looks like the sign was created in 1994 and unit was active during croatian war of independence, 
  basically all `` peripheral '' regions of europe were migrating to better developed regions or to united states ( also brazil , austrialia and so on ) - iberian penisula , ireland , balkans , central europe , southern italy , scandinavia and so on ... 
  many people employed in agricultural sector , undeveloped services, 
   at the same time social-democratic parties are non-existent . 
  kinda mind boggling but i guess we raised our society well to enjoy growth fetish . 
  `` socialism never took root in poland because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires '', 
  polish people were immigarating since mid xix century at least ; it may seem as something new because of restriction during communist era , which were gradually removed during 90s , but in reality it 's a longue duree historical phenomenon, 
  great anylisis , but it 's a bit unobjective to compare us with ukraine , wich faced recession during this period ( from 93 bln $ to 90 in 2015 ) . 
  we should be compared with more stable economies . 
  in 1990 gdp of germany was 1 765 , when polish was 66 ( 3,7 % ) , when in 2015 it was 3 364 to 477 ( 14 % ) ; gdp of czechia was in 1990 40 ( polish was 165 % of this number ) , while in 2015 it was 185 ( polish 257 % ) ; spain , which is comparable with poland by population and territory had in 1990 535 of gdp ( pl : 12 % ) , in 2015 it was 1 193 ( pl : 39 % ) . 
  so as we can we are still behind biggest european economies , but we are the fastest growing economy in region . 
  but he was immediately shushed by kaczy\u0144ski,
