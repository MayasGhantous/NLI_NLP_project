  the thing is she is not a real leader , she is just a puppet controlled by kaczy\u0144ski , who officially is just a regular deputy . 
  same goes with president duda , who did not do or say anything controversial . 
  it 's better than stupid point journalist was making , there is obvious difference between being provocative as trump and as zizek . 
  i would n't really call trump provocative , since he half of the most provocative things he said totally serious . 
  we all know that [ all russians are bears on unicycles ] ( http://s.storage.akamai.coub.com/get/b73/p/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/d3fafa24c05/d4f8e787a08b3d27a7282/med_1471921611_image.jpg ), 
  just imagine history of world war ii described as a big swingers orgy, 
  i guess it 's true about whole region - we really depends on each other, 
  you right , because national flag are for represantion of nationality and nationhood . 
  just imagine that after severe victory polish soldier needs to paint glorious eagle , with all the details , instead of just taking to pieces of cloth , one white , another red and stick them together . 
  same works for your flag . 
   no alienation from the means of production you clearly do not know what means of production are . 
  asfaik ukrainian it seem to me that is more conservative than polish and some words which in polish are considered archaic are still in use in ukrainian . 
  i do n't if you agree with me . 
  yeah you could say about somebody `` luty rywal '' ( fierce rival ) but do n't be surprised is someone would think you were born in middle ages , it 's just very very archaic , and nobody is using this word in this sense , 
   re\u010d i think in slovakian re\u010d is a speech , in polish speech is `` mowa '' . 
  `` re\u010d '' is very close to polish `` rzec '' which a bit old-fashioned version of `` to say '' ( `` i said '' - ja rzek\u0142em ) . 
  i could be also find in polish `` przyrzeka\u0107 '' - `` to promise/to pledge/to swear '', 
  polish january is `` stycze\u0144 '', 
  polish `` luty '' on the other hand means `` very cold '', 
  in polish slavs are `` s\u0142owianie '' which is very close to `` s\u0142owo '' ( a word ) , but in older books you can find also `` s\u0142awianie '' which is much closer to `` s\u0142awa '' . 
  ant that is why many past historians were prefeing this over the first one, 
  you have at least two necid and hlousek , they are classy and they are playing in the best club i know, 
  turkey ? 
  ( and uk soon ), 
  teutonic is not a correct name , in polish we call them `` krzy\u017cacy '' , which basically means knights with crosses, 
  your internet has a very bad ping , around 600 years , 
  i was working as a waiter in restaurant where a group of israeli students was staying . 
  i was going to ask an old teacher who was explaining in hebrew probably a history of holocaust to his students , if he wants coffee or tea . 
  so i asked him in english and was very surprised when he replied me in the most perfect polish language one can hear . 
  really good experience, 
  we were n't bros before the war , but my favourite alternative history scenario is a planned polish-czecho-slovak confederation , that would be great, 
  my high school was named after general josef ben , hero of both nations, 
  i love the civ thing , am a fan of the series , but i was playing as a russia most of the time , but in the civ 5 there was only one option , and not only because i am polish , but poland is the most powerful civ, 
  as pole i confirm ; of course there also some black pages in history of polish catholicism , but most of the time there were at least opposing the current ruler ;, 
  look at us , look at us , we are commonwealth now, 
  yeah transformation years were just wild ; i 'm not a fan of communist area , but at least rebuilding of warsaw was well-thought , of course some things could be done better ( i.e. 
  metro instead of palace of culture , more bypass roads ) but it was at least planned from the beginning to an end, 
  why should it be a german castle if it was build by a teutonic order . 
  it was of course german based order , but it was independent organisation . 
  would you call castles on rodos `` italian '' , because they were builded by joanites ??? 
  moreover malbork served as a seat of polish kings since 1466 till 1793 . 
  before napoleon there were only two kings in hre - king of germany and king of czechia , there was also king in prussia , but he was king outside of hre . 
  and if we really talking only about proper germany , not entire hre , there was only one legitimate king, 
  i see some silesian revisionism ... fight me !, 
  plus emblem of bourbon dynasty in the middle, 
  lithuanian one is called vytis , yours is pohon , i do n't see any conflict ... 
  [ kaer morhen ] ( http://samequizy.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/filing_images_54e3c6ed4a2f5.jpg ), 
  sory it should be `` part of lithuanian heritage '', 
  i agree with you , castle in trakai is of course part of polish heritage , of course we must rember work of polish historian and conservatist in interwar era to preserve it , but i can not agree that smokowski was polish-lithuanian , he was just polish, 
  i dont if you are still answering , but here 's my question : what political thinker had a greatest impact on you and which defines the best your way of thinking ? 
  agamben , gramsci , arendt , foucault , mouffe others ? 
  how razem perceive `` social '' policies of current governement , like ie 500 + program ? 
  do you really believe that ie german proletariat was n't entitled to at least a small share of the product of they work ? 
   terrorists half of them were double agenst of ochrana, 
  communist economy was inefficient , and was unable to recover country from a horrific economical crisis ; changes needed to be done, 
  typical, 
  the only historical proper name is pogo\u0144 / pahonia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pahonia, 
  pogon is a proper name, 
  well i 'm talking about historical emblem , not some 19th century creation, 
   historical flag with the rider it is called `` pogo\u0144 '' and it 's till used by a belarusian democratic national movement, 
  actually in polish we are sometimes using polish form of german name `` kr\u00f3lewiec '', 
  honeslty you may faced problem only in danzig case , since the danzig/gda \u0144sk controversy was a serious issue before the war , and some of us wants gda\u0144sk to be only acceptable form , maybe not in german but surely in english texts . 
  as i said before i do n't see any problem with germans using german names . 
  we are so tolerant that we even allow lithuanians to call wilno vilnius if they want it so much / s, 
  german danzig have a slavic roots , the same as polish gda\u0144sk, 
  well of course they call it danzig , just like in poland we are saying monachium not m\u00fcnchen or wiede\u0144 not wien . 
  not from a reich perspective  but i get you point , it 's all about international recognition, 
  i would it still is a matter of perspective ; let just take as an example so called `` polish occupation of wilno '', 
  sadly it was other way around , and `` hatred '' against russians was much older ( is enough to mention war of 1920 ) ; yes people were glad that war was over , but they often experience russian `` occupation '' as much worse than german , which especially in later years and in rural areas was n't that harsh . 
  in memory of grandparents only ukrainians were worse than russians, 
  of course not ; it was a popular movement , in any other area ( except baltics and maybe volhynia ) shoah took much longer time , mostly due to passiveness of local people, 
  but '' \u017eyd\u0161aud\u017eiai '' were common people, 
   jews supported both poles and soviets which fuelled anti-semitism that did n't exist before it 's an exageration to say that anti-semitism on lithuania did not exist before first soviet occupation . 
  of course it fuelled it but certainly did not create it . 
  the anti-semitic action sparked in all area captured by soviet troops after germans came , but the anti-jewish actions of lithuanian people were extremly strong , after couple months almost all jewish population was wiped out , it can not be justified only by jewish cooperation with soviets, 
  i really lost faith in reddit , if everybody needs a / s to find where the laugh is, 
  i ca n't find an example, 
  i 'm under impression that russian are thinking that everybody is ungratefull towards them - poles and to some extent czechs are `` traitors of slavic race '' and ungratefull for `` the sacrifices of the red army man '' , `` former soviet republics '' are ungratefull for all the years under ussr protection and so on ... everybody is ungratefull , i guess that russian understanding of history is really self-centred, 
  but svoboda had sates in the parliament back then , even now they have correcty me if i 'm wrong 10 seates, 
  lol how can you live in such denial ? 
  once on reddit some lit was reffering to wilno as `` lisboa '' , i was like wtf ? 
  was thinking it had something to do with barok , but now it makes more sense, 
  about portuguese nazi death camps, 
  even openminded russian people have so biased opinion about poland . 
  the only `` postsoviet '' monuments which were destroyed after 1989 were the ones of lenin , dzier\u017cy\u0144ski ( who was polish ) and so on . 
  there was a huge discussion what to do with a monument of `` polish-soviet comradeship '' which was at the main street in warsaw ; eventually it was moved away , because of the newly-builded metro station . 
  not even one monument was destroyed , same goes with russian cementaries ( in my area even couple of the russian and german cementaries from iww was restored , and no one was opposing ! ) . 
  and mentioned by you monument was in fact a commemoration of german female inhabidants of gda\u0144sk , who were in fact raped on massive scale by soviet troops , but asfaik it was a private initiative of a local sculptore . 
  ukraine is not fascist , and it is not ruled by fascists . 
  but we must be aware that in ukraine , even before war , ther right radical flanc of political spectrum was very strong , and the traditions of wartime upa and prewar oun is very important on the western ukraine . 
  i 'm not saying that majority of ukrainians are nazi nationalists , but surely the movement is stronger than anywhere in europe, 
  it 's fourth time i see this joke in this thread ... 
  they really teach you such thing in school in 2011 ? 
  ffs even in poland we have far more friendly lectures on our relations with russia , despite almost 300 years of constant war ... 
  well most occupations are illegal ... 
  you forgot about the witcher 3 blood and wine, 
  we and lithuania believe in long term relationships , we are not the one time thing couple < 3, 
  i think that lithuania means more for us , than slovakia for czechs, 
  it 's the one that was used ; honestly why you even asking me these questions ? , you probably can find more info in german language than i can in polish and english, 
  he left wife and a son , which are now probably without any source of income , also it 's a gesture of recognition of \u0141ukasz urban 's heroic deed,
