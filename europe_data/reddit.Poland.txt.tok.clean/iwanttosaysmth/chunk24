  it was posted on a official page of truck company , where urban was working , also siepomaga is a recognized foundation, 
  he was a driver of a stolen truck , which was used by a terrorist to kill people in berlin , he was taken hostage , and saved lifes of many people by forcing a terrorist to turn the truck off the road , what cost him his life, 
  i know all of this , but still quite surprising since germany or italy are depcited as unitary states , while the difference between various states within them were far bigger than in plc, 
  depiction of plc is really interesting : not only lithuania is marked as independent but also poland , prussia , courlandia and livonia ; livonia is n't divided between plc and sweden , also poland have a direct access to black sea ... 
  in earlier posts many of you said that you want to help somehow family of \u0141ukasz urban . 
  the truck company , where urban was working , established special bank account , where you can send money . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.siepomaga.pl/kierowca-bohater ) below current private bank transfer details of mrs. zuzanna urban , wife of the hero : ** pln ** 19\u00a01020\u00a04795\u00a00000 9602\u00a00354\u00a07346 ** euro ** 35\u00a01020\u00a04812\u00a00000 0202\u00a00160\u00a06342 ** usd ** 26\u00a01020\u00a04812\u00a00000 0102\u00a00160\u00a06359 iban : pl swift ( bic ) bpkoplpw, 
  you mean you know the guy , who knows the place, 
   i 'm looking for polish minority in kaliningrad region let 's just assume that oblast is inhabited by russian speaking polish people, 
   why would you include european part of turkey * deus lo vult !, 
   people are feeling tricked by a liberal elite which they mostly associate with po, 
  studio in warsaw cost right now around 250k pln , at least twice more than couple yeras earlier, 
  so why they are voting for them ? 
  to be honest i can wait till some polish governement will do something about our real estate market, 
   karl urban the pronounciation is pretty much the same , if that 's what you ask about, 
  no he must be talking about sweden, 
  of course they are n't just because they made a 500 + reform does not mean they are left-wing , `` razem '' is the only , actual left-wing party in poland . 
  500 + was a populist move not a social one , and pis is not willing to fulfill their other social promises , for example extended program of communal buildings, 
  this is one of other reasons of kaczynski 's win , the average income of people is basically the same as 10 years before , while the size of economy is probably three times as it was ; commentatores are likely to scare us of the `` right-wing fanatism wave '' throughout the world , while the truth is different , people are feeling tricked by a liberal elite, 
  asfaik the organizator still not provide any usefull information how he want to transfer collected money to the family , so imo it 's better to wait a while when some more trustworthy way to help will show up, 
  he was denied asylum , but he still had other options to stay in europe , but just as a regular migrant , not as a refugee, 
  probably even more , considering that the truck was bigger than in nice , the street was narrow withour clear way to escape , car in nice stopped because he was out of steam , while in berlin the car could easly run much longer, 
  other thing is that in most big european cities big trucks are not allowed to drive within the downtown , even in warsaw which still have undeveloped net of bypass rouds big trucks are not allowed in the center of the city . 
  should n't the truck be stopped earlier just because he was driving on the main street ? 
  this always bother me , polish surnames are always spelled incorrectly in international media , even as simple as `` urban '', 
  [ the sound of it ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/172/853/1310532235003.jpg ), 
  yeah i guess we could let them have it * for couple years more *, 
  simcity stuff, 
  now we know why they need those immigrants in such a large amount, 
  first time when polish car was stealed in berlin ... and all went to shit, 
  sure of course ; there are and were many terroristic organizations of different political and ideological background , that 's a common knowledge . 
  but implying that islamic terrorism have nothing in common with religion of islam is just wrong and stupid, 
  wrong examples , if you are looking for a `` christian terrorism '' you should be rather looking at organization such a ira , which mixed irish nationalism with christian-catholic fundamentalism . 
  statement `` terrorism has no religion '' is just plain stupid because it implies that there is no connection between acts of terror and religin , and both isis and ira examples are proofing falsehood of this statement, 
   terrorism has no religion of course it has, 
  there was no contact with polish driver since 6 pm , his body was presumably founded inside the car , according to polish media, 
  polish tv reporting about dead body found inside the car , preasumbly body of a polish driver, 
  liberum veto was a part of polish custom from the beginning , but was rarely used and only in special , crucial cases . 
  but in the mid 17th was a first interrupted sejm due to purely personal reasons of one of the magnates who bribed one of the deputies . 
  later was only worse , moreover neighbors powers were using liberum veto for its own reasons and as a tool to stop any attempts to reform polish government, 
  it 's not entirely true , sejm was created around 15th century and for several centruies was an effective body , i would say one of the best in europe . 
  but suddenly the things starts going bad way in the mid of 17th century . 
  we mostly use shower . 
  fish is keeped in a bowl or smth like that , and i do n't know anybody who would buy fish 3 weeks before christmas , usually it 's 2 or 3 days earlier, 
  i guess the real issue is that special unit did not trust local police enough to inform them about their operation, 
  situation of polish people resettled from polish lands annexed by ussr was very similiar , people from central poland were treating them as outsiders and called them `` ruskis '', 
  is this the most late anniversary celebrated as a national holiday in europe ? 
  i guess it is, 
  try to form romania in victoria ii , one of the hardest achievements !, 
  romania [ still not unite !, 
  ] ( http://www.nineoclock.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/romania_moldova_-938x535.jpg ), 
  recently we really like parades , 
  i remeber from school that we had a lesson or two about preunion lithuania , as a background for history of plc, 
  deluge was in the mid of 17th century , gnw even later , and you are saying that bad times for lithuania started in 1430 ... 
  ok so you are delusional . 
  if you compare polish-lithuanian union with ottoman domination over huge chunk of hungary, 
  so you were better in soviet union than after death of vytautas ? 
  they actually give us pretty serious autonomy rights something around 1867 , you know like polish language in schools , courts and so on . 
  actually there was pretty serious revisionism throughout the entire cold war era in bundesrepublik , in fact they only recognized the new border in the early 90 's, 
  it still amaze me why slovakia get so much land with cleary hungarian population , is not like slovakia have any historical borders ... 
   but you 'll never reach the level of our suffering . 
  when lithuanians were suffering that much ? 
  kind words . 
  and do n't get me wrong , i like husaria and our history , i was raised on sienkiewicz and jasienica books and matejko 's paintings , and [ things like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/king_john_iii_sobieski_sobieski_sending_message_of_victory_to_the_pope,_after_the_battle_of_vienna_111.png ) always gives me chill . 
  but right now in poland history is almost everywhere often in most inappropriate , historically inaccurate and childish ways possible . 
   whereas poland only has a population of about 38million . 
  yeah , but there is around 50 m polish speakers around the world, 
  but you know that the name ukraine , not in the modern sense of course , was in use since at least xvii century to describe exactly lands inhabited by cossacks ? 
  so i would n't be surprised is many of them could call themselves `` ukrainian cossacks '' , not in the sense the they have modern ukrainian nationality , but just as a geographical adjective, 
   hussar xin zhao why i see this for the first time ????? 
   what 's there to trigger , when not one real cossack throughout the history has ever referred to himself as `` ukrainian '' ? 
  you obviously are ignorant . 
  of course there were ukrainian cossacks , and they even called themselves in such manner . 
  there was for example one on the territory annexed by russia in 1772 , as you can see on this [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wzam2ne.png ), 
  it 's really futile to discuss with you http://imgur.com/hps8ohc, 
  you obviously hear what you want . 
  it even does n't matter to you that according to both polish and russians census lithuanians were in minority in this area . 
  you also can not give any counter-argument, 
  well there is difference when you are `` blinging '' kicking kebabs out of vienna or triumphing in front of the king and just standing in the middle of nowhere in front of a cheap christ statue , 
  of course back then . 
  and yes we can tell . 
  just like we can tell that majority of population of gda\u0144sk wanted more to be a part of germany than poland . 
  that was one of the reasons why lithuania did n't want a plebiscite in vilnus region , because they knew the result . 
  this whole husaria movement is just beyond me . 
  i know they were cool and unique , sure we can be proud of their achievements , but do we really need to put them everywhere they barely fits ? 
  moreover husaria not on the horse looks just ridiculous, 
   russian cossacks ugh , do n't trigger ukraine, 
  and also invincible husaria !!!!, 
  so you really think that when you would ask people living in vilnius region to what country they want to belong to : lithuania or poland , the majority would say : lithuania ? 
  which election ? 
  i am not saying that everything was alright but it clearly shows us a feeling of the population , at least majority . 
  the turnout and a particpation of minorities shows us that people had a free decisions if they want to vote or not . 
  and also there is a huge difference between vilnius and crimea scenario - the rule over this territory and its attachment was n't established and internationally recognized as in the crimea scenario . 
  so there was no violation of mutual aggrements . 
  the scenario is very different . 
  but as i said the support of unification with poland was real . 
  and also comparing it to crimea situation shows only a ignorance of the speaker . 
  polyanska sounds very russian  well to be fair at first it was spelled in latin : polanis , polania , and only later it was changed to `` polonia '' .
