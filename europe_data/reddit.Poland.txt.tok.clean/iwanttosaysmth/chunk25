  going back to the polish name , the etymology maybe different similiar to other polish words like niebo ( the sky ) and niebieski ( blue ) , so polska maybe just adjective of the word `` pole '' ( the field ) . 
  1922 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_central_lithuania_general_election,_1922, 
  in the elections to the sejm of central lithuania almost 70 % of the entire population took part , and all of them were voting on parties supporting unification of poland . 
  so we can easily say that 70 % of population were in support of unifiaction with poland . 
  and of course local nobility never consisted 70 % or even majority of population . 
  and there was never any serious oppostition to polish rule over wilno and its region from within poland , like for example in galicia from ukrainian nationalists . 
  well polska is actually a land of the tribe of polanie , which are basically a `` people living on the fields '' , so then polska should means `` the land of a people living on the fields '' . 
  of course the national identities were mixed , just like on every borderland , polish-german silesia is another example , when often one side of the family declered themselves as germans and the other polish . 
  i would say even more most of them ( polish people in wilno area ) declered themselves as lithuanians ( or rather litwini ) and still considered themselves as a part of polish nation . 
  my point is there was no way that modern lithuania could held wilno without a foreign support without facing polish resistance in that area . 
  and i 'm just sick of shitting on poland and polish people that i hear constantly on r/europe from a lithuanian redditors . 
  oh look samogitian who 's trying to be funny, 
  well i know many people from wilno region and i can read history books ... what 's matter most historical events show us that wilno always wanted to be a part of poland , and lithuanians gained it only due to foreign interventions ( german in 1918 , soviet in 1920 and 1939 and 1944 ), 
  you say what you want , but people of wilno region wanted to live in a polish state, 
  can you give exact paragraph when d\u0142ugosz is descirbing jagie\u0142\u0142o in this manner ? 
  rather land of the people of the fields, 
  ukraine was primarily a name given to wild fields or territory of zaporo\u017ce , as you can see at this [ map ] ( http://w.kki.com.pl/pioinf/przemysl/dzieje/rus/kartografia/7c.jpg ) . 
  other slavic example is a polish region [ krajna ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/krajna ) which was borderland between poland and pomerania in the middle ages . 
  you should n't be annoyed by this , after all etymology of austria is quite similiar, 
  i guess many of them if not all were staged, 
  so half of the people are not ethnic lithuanians, 
  he was pointing out the fact that couple years earlier ukraine and romania were on the same level, 
  \u0414\u043d\u043e is a `` dno '' in polish and we use it in pretty similiar way, 
   \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e chamstwo in polish  so we know what you are talking about, 
  i think that that ancient homeland of all slavs was between vistula and dniepr , and the rest today 's slavic lands were settled through migration, 
  the whole invasions from the early middle ages , were just a relatively small group of warriors invading some distant land and became an elite, 
  panslavic redefined !, 
  actually it is a phrase used by st. paul : si deus nobiscum quos contra nos ? 
  that was the plan !, 
  shit the germans figured it out !, 
  plan white !, 
  execute plan white !, 
  poland is polin, 
  thank you english wikipedia estimates it pretty similiar, 
  of course not . 
  but he is saying that german civilians were massively killed with bullets, 
  are you kidding me ? 
  this number are for a long time consider exaggerated, 
  [ renovated railway stadion in wroc\u0142aw poland ] ( http://www.express-miejski.pl/img/pubfiles/1352282411169_16_12172_2.jpg ), 
  yeah sure and you give us a reliable sources, 
  and why it would be better ? 
   member of antifa where you found it ? 
  he was probably member of nationalistic pro-russian zmiana, 
  it 's hard to feel safe when only thing you can count on is that a leader of the west is a pathological liar, 
  pretty smiliar to [ five lakes valley in polish tatry mountains ] ( http://beztroskiewczasy.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/img_9537.jpg ), 
  it supposed to be a temple of atheism and enlightment , it looks like we were more secular 200 years ago ... 
  you are so lol . 
  yeah compare 50 % russians in riga , to wilno which was polish speaking for five centuries , just lol man . 
  ignore all my comments . 
  crimea is totally different story . 
  as i said lithuania never actually controlled lithuania , just as germans retreated polish people took over control of the city, 
   if saying that we 're not poles and we have a different language is hating then yes . 
  and saying that church is wrong to push polish language . 
  my point is that entire modern lithuanian national consciousness was builded on anti-polish sentiment . 
   lithuanian army was actually advancing when france & co told us to stop sorry , mate , but really polish army could size entire lithuania in like a week , really , let 's be serious . 
   kaunas had ~ similar percentage of poles and lithuanians as vilnius during ww1 there was a polish proporsal to make a plebiscite in all mixed territories , you of course refused . 
  and of course , unlike kaunas , was an important part of polish culture and history . 
   paneriai was as lithuanian as certain death camps were polish . 
  how about no ? 
   there were no pogroms against just till nazis came [ no ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/kauno_susir%c4%97mimas ) , also another one in 1930, 
  no , hating poles in lihuania was pretty much a thing since the birth of modern nationalism and rebirth of lithuania . 
  it only get worse . 
  lithuania surely know [ how to backstabbe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93lithuanian_peace_treaty ) . 
  also poland also was country-in-the-making . 
  and it was n't a backstabbe , conflict of vilnius was pretty much open , we just were stronger and we used it , just like lithuania in memel case . 
  so do n't try to play victim . 
  also in fact lithuania never , literally never , have an actual control of vilnius until 1994 . 
  always it was given to you by some outside forces - german , nazis , soviet , you name it , whatever . 
   when are you going to say sorry about auschwitz ? 
   this is so stupid . 
  that i 'm not even going to explain , preach to deaf ears, 
  title mentions only `` native '' language, 
  why belarusia is using two languages ? 
  it was never big industrial city , and problem with acces to memel seaport surely did not help , but it was always important cultural and scientific center , and after years of harsh russian rule , the interwar period was one of the best in the history of the city . 
  why we should say sorry and for what ? 
  for defending our people ? 
  maybe you should say sorry for ponary massacre first ? 
  yes, 
   the same was with vilnius - it was the most educated region , the main language was polish and so it became polish speaking , but not polish can you prove somehow that polish speaking people living in wile\u0144szczyzna did not have polish identity ? 
  i mean i understand that were some people there speaking lithuanian or polish ( maybe both language ) that did not have any clear identity or have polish-lithuanian identity ( like krajowcy ) , there were also people speaking for example belarussian who identify themselves with lithuanian or polish and so on , and so on ; almost every possible combination was present back then in the region . 
  but every avaiable evidence let us believe that majority of people living in wile\u0144szczyzna region were in fact of polish identity : 1 ) election in 1922 was boycotted by non-polish minorities , but majority of people took part in voting ( 65 % ) and 80 % of them voted on de facto unification with poland 2 ) during interwar period there was n't any serious resistance against polish rule in wilno region . 
  there was of course organisations like tymczasowy komitet litwin\u00f3w wile\u0144skich , but it represented only fraction of lithuanians living in poland ( approximately 70 thousands , less than number of polish people living in republic of lithuania ) . 
  it was a minority in wojew\u00f3dztwo wile\u0144skie which have population of 1,2 mln people . 
  it 's not even comparable with situation in galicia for example , where ukrainians were as numerous as poles , and actively opposed of polish rule in the area . 
  as i said lithuanian minority was very vocal and sometimes even hostile towards polish state , but it was what it was a `` minority '' , in the best case couple percent of the region 's population . 
  3 ) during ww2 polish resistance against german occupation and lithuanian administration was much larger than lithuanian forces in this area , which by the way were largely transfered to wilno region from kaunas nobody is expecting from lithuanians to treat ak as heroes . 
  but it was a polish army and their were fighting for polish raison d'etat , for integrity of polish borders and independence against every occupant . 
  poland seized wilno region with force but not against of its inhabitants , without violation of any international agreement or law . 
  wilno was never occupied by polish forces , it 's a fact , and i am happy that our foreign minister made it clear for anyone . 
  i will not comment your comparison between stalin and ak . 
  stalin was n't just leader of hostile country it was one of the gratest criminals in human history . 
  i never heard about this shooting . 
  pilsudski maybe screwed up maybe not , but nationalist policy of lithuanian governement , persecution of polish people living in kaunas and other parts of prewar lithuanian republic was n't without impact . 
  of course, 
   here 's again the same documentary with polish subtitles , the best freely available source i can find . 
  it 's rather good . 
  sadly the documentary is full of false informations and distorions . 
  for example it mentions some kind of polish attritions in moletai and utena regions , which never took place . 
  or at least i can not find any prove of this ( on the other hand in both places huge pogroms of jewish population took place ) . 
  the only real polish war crime was a dubinkai massacre .
