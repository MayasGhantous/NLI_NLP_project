  w\u0142adys\u0142aw jagie\u0142\u0142o king of poland and grand duke of lithuania , lord and heir of ruthenia etc. 
  died of cold which he cought when he was listen to the singing of nightingale, 
  exactly , and as we know germans to the last die of the war were doing everything possible to not realease them, 
  did n't see this kind of statement in any thread about volhynian genocide ... 
  lenin was n't just terrorist , he was very talented politician , probably the best one in russia at that time ; if you study history of revolution you would see that chances of bolshevik 's success were really small, 
  actually it is much better, 
  pierestroika , glasnost uskornienie are sometimes translated to polish as przebudowa , jawno\u015b\u0107 , przyspieszenie , but everybody knows them in an original form, 
  eastern partnership ? 
  making poland one of the main countries in eu ? 
  being the leader of entire region , and advocating for real interest of the countries in our area , not building some dillusional structures as intetmarium ? 
  having good relations with germany , uk and usa at the same time ? 
  is this enough ? 
  this ` holocaust ' in particular was against jewish vermin that destroyed german nation and its spirit . 
  so it was n't because of their ` race ' or ethinicity , but their ( alleged ) activities . 
  oh god pls no, 
  was he really ? 
  imo he was one of the best since fall of communism, 
  yeah the translation `` it 's not my problem '' is n't the best , it means more like `` i do n't want to have anything in common with what you/they are doing , i 'm out of here '', 
  idont knowyou why you downvoted [ take alook ] ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?height=400&amp;id=mktgdpuaa646nwdb&amp;nsh=1&amp;width=600 ), 
  no they basically in the same spot as in 1991 . 
  you have an old data , there was a lot going on in last 5 years, 
  you should compare us to hungary or czechia , ukraine is a special case, 
  yes of course you are right , germany is huge economical superpower because the entire eastern european market is opened to them, 
  that 's bullshit , zloty is just historical name of currency used in a plc , the name is the gulden/guilder and just means that the coin is made of gold, 
  actually the same thing is/was going in poland , the point is that among the many other groups of former owners , only church get a full refund as quickly as possible, 
  does the joke australia is a part of europe is old already ? 
  yeah i think it is, 
  there was ethnic cleansing of polish people living in ussr before the war , the so called `` polish operation '' , when around 140k of polish people was killed, 
  no i just divided 1500 i 'm on 300 km per hour , 
  yeah you probably right, 
  yes i know , and imo it was honest mistake , he propably meant baltic, 
  well calling ireland , though true from geographical perspective , is a bit controversial , contrary to calling estonia a baltic state, 
  that 's not even a bait , you can try better, 
  grammar mistake baltic vs balt, 
  go down to hell , or better to library, 
  in polish part yes , there is a huge plan to build a network of fast railways in poland, 
  the notion that history of humankind is a history of neverending war and slaughter is just false, 
  what 's your point ? 
  do katy\u0144 make nazis suddenly look more innocent ? 
  does reddior with russian flair can not condemn nazis crimes , i do n't get it, 
  baltics are very proud of the people fighting alongside nazis, 
  there were other reasons , and i do n't think that one is even that important . 
  polish language have a writing system but still latin was used in chancellery , same with almost every language in europe at that time, 
  is the democratically elected governement above polish law ? 
  i do n't think so, 
  paris - berlin - warsaw ... in 5 hours soon, 
  it depends on what poland we are talking about , conisdering 1918 independence it were j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski , roman dmowski , ignacy daszy\u0144ski , wincenty witos and others , in this order more or less ; if we are talking about 1989 there is a lot more controversy but figures such as lech wa\u0142\u0119sa , tadeusz mazowiecki , bronis\u0142aw geremek , leszek moczulski , jacek kuro\u0144 and others, 
  this is a crime , it should be forbidden , actually panorama is a part of heritage , we have similiar problem in [ warsaw ] ( http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131126004227/warszawa/images/f/f4/belweder_ ( wsch % c3 % b3d ) _ 2 . jpeg ) , but it 's not even comparable with yours, 
  so it suddenly makes it normal ? 
  i think that you only need to take years 1939-45 into consideration, 
  i have a different feelings about this, 
  we always must remeber such events , it always will remind us that germany 's aim in ww2 was n't just to conquer and expand , they actually wanted to wipe out entire nations , it was n't a normal war, 
  yes it is , still better than being pride of nazi past, 
  bulgaria stronk ? 
  baltics clearly have some problem ... 
  unrelated mate , but a nice try, 
  in old latin chronicles there was not a separate letter for the sound `` u '' instead of it the letter `` v '' was used, 
  same in poland , karol wielki -  kr\u00f3l, 
  actually in term of economic prosperity it was a great period for all the russia subjected nations , economy was booming equally in ukraine , batlics , poland , stolen lands and so on , in one place more than other , but nonetheless russia was developing pretty fast . 
  of course in terms of rusification , at least in polish case , it was a dark period , until 1905 revolution, 
  nothing new , whitewashing nazi past is a national sport in lithuania ; `` soviet were worse !, 
  german did nothing wrong ! '', 
   but as times go by , it really does seem that perhaps having the uk out of the eu is not such a bad thing after all , as what the eu needs atm are members who are willing to move forward towards more productive integration . 
  so let 's all make the best out of it . 
  i have diffent opinion . 
  i guess that last couple years that strategy of `` running away forward '' was n't the best solution , time really works wonders , over the last 20 years eu doubled in size , it caused many problems , there was also a big economic crisis that undermined trust within the whole union , there are new threats on our borders . 
  we really need to sit down and came up with new solutions , and imo `` more integration '' is n't the one we need . 
  eu need to be more democratic , people need to feel that eu is closer to them , parliament needs more prerogatives , also the role of smaller nations need to be bigger, 
  the new bad guys from the new trilogy are so nazi that it looks like a bad satire, 
   i 'm sure they did , they knew that russia had already mobilized 1 million men on the austrian border , moltke and wilhelm to an extent were very paranoid men . 
  but entire schliffen 's plan was based upon a conviction that russia would be unable to mobilize enough soldiers on the front to realistically threaten germany before france would collapse, 
  sorry , i totally forgot about klaipeda , for some reason i was thinking you only have a `` palanga '' like before the war, 
  is this entire coast ? 
   no , grey was very adament to make sure no war would break out , one of the main criticisms of grey is that he would n't threaten war as a deterrant and this predates the july crisis , the naval agreement with france and the guarantee of belgian neutrality is what changed this . 
  anything what you said does not contradict with anything what i have said . 
  the indpendence of netherlands and belgium was a british raison d'\u00e9tat . 
  german officials really believed that gb would n't not intervene but it only proofs their naivety . 
   that 's true but they were still years behind germany , russia lost 250,000 men in trying to invade west prussia at the start of the war . 
  but the reason was a bad leadership , not a lack of weapons or technology . 
  also fact that germans needed to fight them in east prussia so early was the reason why germany eventually lost the war , they lost battle of marne because several divisions needed to be send to eastern front , and germans did not expect that russia would be able to send that many forces so far inside german land so early . 
   that 's true but he did n't want a war on two sides , he was in the end pressured to mobalize the german army and is reported to have said `` you will regret this , gentlemen . '', 
  eh i do not believe in this . 
  he clearly believed that germany was able to beat both neighbours according to schliffen 's plan . 
  he may had some second thoughts , but since the beginning of his rule he did not do anything to break the franco-russian entente, 
  yeah ian fleming was working for british intelligence, 
  i guess all the bond villians depictions are influenced by nazi and also [ italian fascist ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bi15cznedxi/v2r6d9gdphi/aaaaaaaakyk/znux_bx0ghizuanlwae2hztcaw-l6aisgclcb/s1600/the%2bheadquarters%2bof%2bmussolini%2527s%2bitalian%2bfascist%2bparty%252c%2b1934.jpg ) imaginery, 
   not really , britain did n't want war of any kind because it would n't benefit them at all due to their reliance on international trade , the only thing they did n't want was german domination of europe , and for this they were ready to risk an open war with germany . 
   russia was that far behind the other countries and people were getting very rebellious against the tsar due to pogroms and murders of men joining trade unions , it 's not true . 
  tzar have still very strong position and was very popular , with the whole common saying `` the tsar is good , the boyars are bad '' , yeah there was strong democratic and leftist opposition bad without any real influence on villages . 
  also russia was actually better prepared than anybody expected , tzar and his advisors were looking for some kind of great succes to strenghten their rule , and war with germans was a great opportunity , especially if it could be justified by `` defending '' our `` slavic brothers '' same could be said about austria which needed something to strenghten the unity of the state and union . 
  as it turned out for both empires it was `` win everything or loose everything '' kind of game . 
   kaiser wilhelm just wanted to build up his navy to match the brits before anything else and when gave austria the blank cheque wanted them to invade straight away to avoid russia getting involved , kaiser wilhelm wanted to break `` the siege '' i.e. 
  the franco-russian alliance and also give to the germans rightful `` place under the sun '' as a one of the greatest powers . 
  and no , he was very well aware that attack on serbia means war with russia , if russia would n't help serbia it would lost all the legitimacy us a defender of `` all the slavs '' , which he gained throughout numerous wars with turkey in the xix century . 
  it looks like some b movie villians gatheiring, 
  actually i dont ' think it even look nice , contrary to many people itt ; it 's not even that monumental, 
   house of jagello ( polish , today the crest of poland ) well actually coa of jagiellons is a two-barred cross [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two-barred_cross#/media/file:coa_family_pl_jagiellon.svg ), 
  sejm of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth was a most important governing body in the entire state since its creation in 1569 . 
  it consists of three `` stany sejmuj\u0105ce '' ( delibating estates ) : the king , the actual sejm , which was a lower chamber , and senate . 
  all three has its origins in the custom law of polish kingdom and was fully formed before the union .
