  [ berlin rightful polish clay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaxa_of_k%c3%b6penick ), 
  lithuania not central europe ? 
  i guess it 's based on [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/mapa_from_ukraine_postcard_1919.jpg ) map , which shows lands inhabited by ukrainians around 1919, 
  i 'm not getting the joke about japan , russia is missing because as it was included in description : `` turkish and russian aspirations are too big to be showed on the map '', 
  ah ok , totally forget about it , i guess the point was that lithunian nationalists wants all historical regions back ( suwa\u0142ki and others ) and lithuania minor , not more russians or poles, 
  what russians ? 
  great lechia starts even further west, 
  this is the choice that almost europeans need to make nowadays . 
  in poland every center or left voter need to vote on civic platform , tusk and company because it 's only political force capable to win with kaczy\u0144ski, 
  the war with georgia was n't entirely russian fault though, 
  do n't try to rationalize it , it would be one of the most barbaric deeds, 
  everything what poland did in ukraine and belarus is not even comparable to what germans did in poland in ww2 aone, 
  not much if we talk about destroying entire city ... 
  man , ok i get it , my point was that greece is really military strong for such rather small nation , they have 8th time smaller population than you , and yet they have 460k soldiers and turkey have 590k, 
  that 's correct . 
  it was the biggest dream of w\u0142adys\u0142aw iv . 
  he was planning to sack constantinopole , crash tatars , conquer moldavia and wallachia for his son , and liberate al christians nations of ottoman empire . 
  his plans might even go further , since his wife marie-louise gonzaga , who was last descendant of palaiologos , so he probably seen himself as a restorer of east roman empire . 
  of course the idea was insane , polish nobles would never agree to pay enormous taxes for such expedition , also it destroyed our good relations with porta , and provoked cossacks against polish governement ( w\u0142adys\u0142aw was planning to use them as an auxiliary force , so he promised them many privilegies , which sejm never agreed to accept ) and eventually let to chmielnicki uprising . 
  well they did not have such mercy for warsaw , which was systematically destroyed building after building for more than three months ... 
  look my [ other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/696lbs/invisible_church_in_turkey/dh4uh7k/ ), 
   you meant the temple mount , pretty sure al-aqsa was built after the crusades . 
  via wiki :  the current construction of the al-aqsa mosque is dated to the early umayyad period of rule in palestine . 
  architectural historian k. a. c. creswell , referring to a testimony by arculf , a gallic monk , during his pilgrimage to palestine in 679 -- 82 , notes the possibility that the second caliph of the rashidun caliphate , umar ibn al-khattab , erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers somewhere on the haram ash-sharif . 
  one of the many place were virgin mary stopped by, 
  yes but there are some styles that should n't be mixed , especially not all of them in one place ; sometimes it 's even hard to say `` is it neoclassical ? 
  or maybe empire ? 
  or just some guy imagination how temples in ancient rome look like ? 
  '' ; trash !, 
  a lot uglier, 
  it totally deserve all the hate , it 's a nightmare , just a architectural trash, 
  oh my sweet summer child , you still did not see [ this ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/warszawa/images/7/7a/swiatynia_opatrznosci_bozej_w_lipcu_2011.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110726221839 ) or [ this ] ( https://d-nm.ppstatic.pl/kadr/k/r/f5/8c/5577f7a7c15ed_o,size,933x0,q,70,h,97658f.jpg ) ... yes poland is turning into catholic wonderland ... 
  still communist regime rebuilded almost every church destroyed by germans, 
  [ picture of inside ] ( http://www.roszakroman.pl/photo/142-1607-untitled_panorama1j%20kf.jpg ) , and yes , these are wings of polish hussars, 
  it 's just an ugly baby born after some crazy architectural swingers party , which get out of control, 
  your right it 's certainly not neoclassical , first of all it try to mimic st. peters bassilica , so it should be some sort of manierisitic architecture , but of course it 's not even this . 
  there are elements of baroque , gothic , rococco and so on , but eveything is builded from modern materials , and for me it look more like a fancy tesco with a dome on the roof ... 
  sadly there is totally overlooked [ beautiful , small neogothic church in the town ] ( http://www.studiopiktogram.pl/foto%20piktogram/katalog/polska/lichen/0067_lichen.jpg ), 
   you think a candidate that said `` jesus guides my every step '' would be laughed at and ridiculed into assisted suicide in poland ? 
  i would say no , but my fellow contrymen are believing in so many curious things right now so idk, 
   solomons temple of course i was talking abut al-aqsa mosque  jews have a very different experience as do poles let me remind you . 
  what you mean ? 
  of course turkish army is bigger but not overwhelming , take a look at this : http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=turkey&amp;country2=greece&amp;submit=compare, 
  turkey is n't really that much more powerful than greece , they have one of the biggest european armies, 
  you may not know but there was also time when banner with golden cross of jerusalem was waving over salomon 's temple, 
  yeah , it 's just like poland would destroy warsaw , krak\u00f3w or wilno after partitions , sane nations did not do that ( although russians burned down moscow in napoleonic era ), 
  this is excellent analogy , and the story only proves that turks never feel really connected to hagia sophia and were n't treating it as a part of they heritage , but just as a spoil of war, 
  lol man when greek were building one of the greatest temples and institutions in history of humanity , turks were pasturing in some middle of nowhere in central asia , a bit of respect, 
  there is a difference greece and thrace was converted to christianity without a force, 
  no american ever said that they constitution was n't actually the first one , because the corsica was first, 
  because we can name several different `` constitutions '' from earlier period , which would fit the definition even better than corsican one, 
  so we can say that artyku\u0142y henrykowskie was first constitution in the world, 
   because it 's not modern ? 
  in the same manner we can argue that [ henrican articles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henrician_articles ) were first constitution , or one of the golden bule and so on, 
  people keep forgetting that prussia was n't really powerfull until early nineteenth century , post-napoleonic era, 
  because poland failed to modernize its regime . 
  it 's not like polish army became smaller than lets say in 15th or 16th century , it was actually the sane . 
  the 16 thousand soldiers you mention was actually a standing army and it was bigger than any other king had before propably . 
  the difference is that the majority of armies from the past consist of pospolite ruszenie and mercenaries . 
  the first did not have any military value in 17th century , and king did not have money to hire mercenaries . 
  you can acquire land in many different ways , not every expansion is a theft . 
  let 's take for example alaska or louisiana , were they stolen from its former holders ? 
  no , they were bought in a cordial aggrement . 
  so homosexuality should be normal for a xix century people because it was normal in ancient greece ? 
  it 's really something very different , first of all is much harder to corrupt entire country than one person, 
  i admire works of your ancestor marc bloch , one of the greatest historians and medievalists of all the time , especially his societe feodal was remarkable, 
  i would say you are a racist if you vote on radical racist party , which leader couple years earlier wrote book which huge part was about dangerous jewry, 
  they have majoirty if you include deutschnationale volkspartei, 
  but the majority was supporting them, 
  yeah stefan was great and i was referring exactly to this war, 
  no body is saying anything about genocide , we just capture the city and its inhabitants will peacefully convert, 
  but deus vult ... 
  yes and no , i think that real killers of plc and it 's heritage were nazis , because until ww2 it was a real thing, 
  once a polish fief , couple of wars were fought ever territory . 
  there is even popular saying in polish `` za kr\u00f3la olbrachta wygin\u0119\u0142a szlachta '' - `` during king albrecht 's reign all the nobility have died '' , it 's referring to famous polish deafet in moldavia when almost entire polish army was wiped out, 
   of the 14 characteristics of fascism , theresa may is about 12 of them it only shows how ridiculous they are, 
  there is no real independent press in russia , organisations like memorial are prohibited or persecuted , opposition is a joke , biggest opposition parties are created by kremlin and serve only to legimitisation of putin 's rule , and putin is of course indestructible, 
  no situation in russia is at least equally bad if not worse . 
  the only difference is that what erdogan did in spite of one year putin have done during 17 years of his reign, 
  stalin was basically almost only soviet leader with mustache, 
  bokemia robbed uor flag, 
  yeah people are tend to forget it far to often , different system different campaign , american system is bad not because it change people 's choice , it 's bad because presidency could be undermine if president lost popular vote, 
  lol til, 
  polan only uniqe flag in hol urop, 
  or maybe because ukrainians wanted to be a part of western hemisphere . 
  because quality 's of life there is much higher than in russia . 
  it 's really matter of cultural and economical attraction , if russia would as wealthy as germany or us and can offer same level of investments and also social and cultural liberties than people in ukraine , russia even poland would be happy to accept closer relations with you . 
  russia just do n't have that much to offer , also you require strict political obiedience , which for free nations is not acceptable . 
  of course , i was as speaking in rather loose manner , but i firmly believe what i said, 
  well you are greek you should now better . 
  but my understanding is that russia was very active during greek war of independence , so the good relations are just maintained to this day, 
  yeah after 1968 the official policy of warsaw pact was antiisraeli, 
  of course not . 
  i did not say that , i just said that religion is one thing that bring them together . 
  also spain never experienced russian imperialism but they opinion of russia is n't that favourable, 
  well first of all i would n't expect them to understand me, 
  really sad , well they people are living in information bubble , they have no way to face a counterarguments , so this reaction is kind of understandable edit : relation  reaction, 
  find valid contrargument  can not answer in constructive manner  call it trolling instead of changing mind  profit ? 
  powerfull russia can invade moldova any time it want xd mate you are so full of propaganda shit that is almost unbelievable , as i said first fix your country , economy , preserve the well-being of your own people , do n't try invade kirgistan xd also why do you want to invade or `` influence '' these countries in the first place ? 
  why ca n't you just have good relations with belarus ?
