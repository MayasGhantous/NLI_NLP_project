  and that wermacht was n't normal army , wermacht was waging total war and killing civilians in mass murders , executions and genocides was part of war german nazi state was waging against its neighbors, 
  i did not ignore anything . 
  both massacres sinchon and bodo league were commited by ** south korean ** forces !, 
  not us military !, 
  as i said in the same manner we should count 500 thousands of serbs killed by ustashi as german war crimes . 
  of course americans were commited military crimes , for example : [ canicatti massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canicatt%c3%ac_massacre ) ( 8 casualties ) [ biscari massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biscari_massacre ) ( 75 prisoners of war killed ) [ no gun ri massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_gun_ri_massacre ) ( 500-600 civilians ) it were of course terrbile events , but in the history of us military rather rare , and not comparble with for example slaughter of warsaw during and after warsaw uprising ; when 600 thousands of people were expelled from their houses , 100 thousands died during war operations , and around 63 thousands were just executed just for being polish ; [ here is how warsaw looked after uprising ] ( https://youtu.be/vz8hcpn3mw4?t=6633 ), 
  but you still ca n't provide me an example of us war crime comparable with wola massacre . 
  i do n't know about theae guys , if they were part of unit who commited crimes in putten , if they were fighting on east , west , or just siting behind the desk ; but if we are talking about eastern front afaik probably huge majority of wermacht soldiera took part or were aware of massive war crimes commited by german army or ss . 
  well i was referring to video posted by op , where wermacht was portrayed as a innocent military force, 
  but why you are counting war crimes of south korean army as commited by us military ? 
  it 's just comparable with ustashi massacres , which were commited in the presence of german army by their allies, 
   hey , around about 100.000-200 .000 dead , including children and all those `` filthy communists '' . 
  slaughtered by the south korean forces ( supported by the us ) while the us sit next to them and did ... nothing . 
  so we should count ustashi or ukrainians massacres as german crimes ? 
  should we count civilian casualties of german military operations ? 
  and they took a car !, 
  a german car !, 
  one should know that one german car = 600 dutch men, 
  it 's matter if civilians died during war operations or just in planned genocide, 
  in warsaw german soldiers were just going from home to another , from one doors to another and killed all people inside , and throughout entire week they killed all inhabitants of one quarter in warsaw , find me something comparable on american side , and then i will agree with you, 
   us troops committed in vietnam or korea , hell , even more recent in iraq if you want to you can really seriously compare those two things . 
  i would say that american army killed less civilians throughout entire 20th century than germans in that one week in warsaw , not even mentioning countless other crimes and atrocities . 
  the level of denial among wermacht combatants is unbelivable, 
  in one summer week of august 1944 german troops , consisting of ** wermacht ** , ss , and auxiliary troops , killed almost 50 thousands of polish people in quarter of warsaw , the infamous [ wola massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wola_massacre ) ; but yeah wermacht was innocent, 
  sorry man ; but i doubt 9 of 10 random people would know that blue mosque even exists , while anybody who had a history book hands would know how hagia sophia looks ; it 's the most iconic building in history of constantinopole/istanbul, 
  the `` universal jew '' was always around the croner , if not inside germany , who `` present '' in governemnt usa , he was among communists in ussr ... 
  prawa lithuania did not feel connection with gdl ; for them history of lithuania suddenly ended with death of vytautas , what was later for model lithuanians was part of polish history, 
  yeah i know that , but the point is not who was more important , but who people would be looking on wikipedia , and as i pointed out sigismund may be interesting for people of several countries - sweden , poland , russia , belarus , ukraine , three baltic states , and others . 
  healthy attitude , 
  [ look on the full list for poland ] ( http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/rankings/people/pl/all/-4000/2010/h15 ) on the 5th place is ... catherine ii of russia  born in stettin in german noble family , was rulling over russia , and basically raped poland ; yet the 5th most famous , 
  well sigismund was rulling above couple of today 's countries , he was messing around in russia , he even wanted to rule over them , and basically he created new catholic church with over 5 mln followers today, 
  they were polish of course , 
  are you joking right ? 
  kopernik was from family with german origins , but he was bornd , lived , studied and worked in poland , and he was loyal sucject of polish king , it 's no way comparable with kant, 
  great post, 
   soviets & nazis slaughtered 1/3 of lithuania 's pre-war population well huge part of this 1/3 were jews , who were slaughtered by other lithuanians in many cases, 
  it 's just my guess but i think that the most fo icelanders consider snorri higher than bjork and his pretty well-known on iceland , hec i know one song of bjork and read one snorri 's saga, 
   lithuanians never called themselves ruthenians , contrary , ruthenians started to call themselves lithuanians and `` ruthenian '' is latinzed form of the name used in english language , the proper ones are variations of `` rusyn '', 
  `` you can build a throne with bayonets , but you ca n't sit on it for long '', 
  what 's more interesting it 's somehow ending in 16th-17th century . 
  in most central european countries after extinction of local dynasty there is a period of attempts to establish new dynasty by inviting nobles from other countries . 
  czechia were inviting habsburg , jagiellon and luxembourg , but eventually local noble of podebrad was elected . 
  same in hungary , when in the end nobles from zapolya , corvinus and batory dynasty were elected as kings . 
  in russia it was wisniowiecki and sobiesi in second half of 17th century , in russia it was a michail romanov after period of the time of troubles . 
  and so on, 
  you really think that ? 
  imo there are mamy parts of russian history which can be viewed as a not-hostile against western neighbors . 
  i mean it 's often matter of interpretation or topi\u0107 choosing . 
  well according to oldest ruthenian annales he was voluntarly invited by slavic nobility to rule over them . 
  it was a common custom , another example is frankish samo , si\u0144ce nobles were svoiding appoitment one of them , because they were equals, 
   only in villages and really small cities . 
  i think that anywhere in poland you can find at least one person to have simple conversation in english, 
  i think that second place is wroc\u0142aw , gda\u0144sk or toru\u0144, 
  palace is much wider it cover almost half of the huge square , it ca n't be really surronded by any other buildings or regular streets and sidewalks, 
  krak\u00f3w was a small city in xix century , while polish cities were boosting due to industrial revolution , like warsaw , lwow , lodz and so on , krak\u00f3w was still small , medieval city, 
  bucharest was called this name ; there is even a book about bucharest and warsaw and similiarities between them by blazej brzostek the titile is `` parises ( ? ), 
  of other europe '' ( pary\u017ce innej europy ), 
   why did sicz form in the first place ; why did the khmelnytsky uprising occur ? 
  because cossacks were trying to achieve position equal to the nobility and avoid being serfs , and as much as i admit they were right the liberation of serfs and even more independance of ukraine was n't actual reason of uprising . 
  [ giedroyc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giedroyc_doctrine ), 
  well he was n't in nazi concentration camp when man sent by him ( yes , he did not have enough courage to do it himself ) were killing polish and ukrainian officials in prewar poland . 
  and number of ukrainian victims of bandera were bigger than number of polish victims . 
  and he was n't in concentration camp in years 1939-41 when he collaborated with germans , persecuted polish people and killed jews in pogroms . 
  he was n't in concetration camp when he made an alliance with germans in 1944 . 
  today 's poland . 
  lithuania without few areas in north belarus is basically a niemen 's basin . 
  from historical perspective i think we can see border beetween gd of moscov and tatar states in the south . 
  also ancient kingdom of armenia , but there is more historical borders visable on this map - border between castilla and aragon , borders of kingdom of burgundy and so on . 
   found a putinist !, 
  i think he ment they were `` ruthenians '' member of east slavic group of tribes living in ancient `` rus '' or `` ruthenia '' with centre in kiev , which was demolished by golden horde and divided on several duchies , the strongest were nowogrod , moscow , halich and polotsk . 
  and i think that since then we can observe seperate nations of ukraine , belarus and russia, 
   estonian jews and other half was killed by nazis , estonia literally became juden free - free of jews . 
  while in lithuania like 95 % of jews were killed who were the nazis ? 
   historically speaking region itself was majority lithuanian you must be joking , area aound vilnius , nowogr\u00f3dek and so on were heavily ruthenized  before rise of nationalism polish speaking population considered themselves lithuanians and most of them were actually ethniclly lithuanians , your very own pilsudski was from ethnically lithuanian family that dates back to pagan times but you that back than the name `` pole '' was n't an ethnic term , but it described a member of polish nation , despise of one 's ethinc origins ... nobody had any problems if someons had tatar , lithuanians , german or scotish origins , he was a pole if he feeling as a pole, 
   but almost half of interwar poland was n't even ethnically polish either , so there is no excuse other than being dick to a country to used to ally yourself with . 
  but all of the biggest minorites were a nations that did n't have its own country - belarusians , ukrainians , jews ; the rest were small minorites living at the borders , just like everywhere else, 
  stalin who had casting vote on this matter from 1943 start insisting on so called `` curzon line '' as a future polish-soviet border , because on one hand he was trying to keep annexed land and on the other curzon line was a british idea from 1920 and in his opinion could be more willingly accepted by uk . 
  in fact there were several variants of curzon line , some of them left to poland lvov , grodno , even wilno . 
  well of course even if someone saying pure bullshit he shoudl n't be fined pr persecuted , no doubt about it . 
  my point is that blogger was n't telling truth on other matters . 
  well not exactly , if you look at [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/soviet_and_german_sphere_of_influence_in_the_second_polish_republic_according_to_soviet-german_agreement_28_09_1939.png ) you can cleary see that cities like bialystok , brze\u015b\u0107 nad bugiem and many others were annexed by zsrr , and they are in today 's borders of poland, 
  i love that brian mention thomas mann , so in his character, 
  it 's hard to have a clear stance on this particular matter . 
  because on the one hand blogger had right saying that soviet nazi aggrement sparked ww2 , but on the other he was trying to defend bandera and his followers saying mostly bollocks , like he was n't a nazi collaborator, 
  ** framework convention for the protection of national minorities ** article 11 1 the parties undertake to recognise that every person belonging to a national minority has the right to use his or her surname ( patronym ) and first names in the minority language and the right to official recognition of them , according to modalities provided for in their legal system . 
  2 the parties undertake to recognise that ** every person belonging to a national minority has the right to display in his or her minority language signs , inscriptions and other information of a private nature visible to the public ** . 
  3 in areas traditionally inhabited by substantial numbers of persons belonging to a national minority , the parties shall endeavour , in the framework of their legal system , including , where appropriate , agreements with other states , and taking into account their specific conditions , to ** display traditional local names , street names and other topographical indications intended for the public also in the minority language ** when there is a sufficient demand for such indications . 
  lithuanian minority laws are against european law, 
  it 's probably hard to understand for someone who speaks language who is not widespread and spoken by relatively small population on one territory , but languages can vary substantially and still be one language . 
  hec even in poland the way people in eastern poland , silesia , tatra mountains , pomerania and so on speak is very different , so no wonder that polish people in kazahstan , former kresy , lithuania are speaking differently than polish people who use literary language, 
  i 'm not saying that gdl is exclusively belarusian but it is a common heritage of lithuania , belarus and others, 
  well it was very important city , and center of culture no doubt about it, 
  but it was speaking in old-belarusian , ruthenian nobility was a part of rulling class , the center of rulling was between vilnius novohrodek brest and grodno , imo belarussian have all right to look at gdl as they heritage, 
  it did n't become . 
  but it 's a part of belarus history . 
  term belarus or belarussian was n't even in use in 16th and 17th century , all belarussian were called themselves `` litvins '' they did n't feel like they were conquered by lithuania, 
  or maybe lithuania speaking polish ? 
  i mean almost nobody is speaking gealic in scotland , ireland or wales is similiar , austria is speaking germany , croatia and serbia share same language ... language is important but it 's not sine qua non reason to create a nation, 
  yes , that more or less was a difference between pagan lithuania and ancient orthodox culture of ruthenia, 
  facts are not often surprising,
