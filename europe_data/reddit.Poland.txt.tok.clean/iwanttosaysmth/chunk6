  [ austria is doing it too ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/da9hjp/bilingual-road-direction-signs-in-south-tyrol-or-alto-adige-italy-da9hjp.jpg ), 
  i 'm not a linguist so it 's hard to tell , every polish from lithuania who i met or hear him speaking was speaking proper polish, 
  i 'm not a lawyer but framework convention for the protection of national minoritie is document of council of europe, 
  i was looking for something on youtube and i found this video about polish-lithuanian relations [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdvlwansqa ) , and i can perfectly understand anyone who is speaking polish there , it 's a little bit different , you can hear so called `` kresovian melody '' or `` za\u015bpiew kresowy '' but it 's the same how people are speaking in eastern poland, 
  in poland it 's regular .

  if you can pls link to some video, 
  nonetheless lithuanian law is in contradiction with this international convention, 
  ** framework convention for the protection of national minorities ** article 11 1 the parties undertake to recognise that every person belonging to a national minority has the right to use his or her surname ( patronym ) and first names in the minority language and the right to official recognition of them , according to modalities provided for in their legal system . 
  2 the parties undertake to recognise that ** every person belonging to a national minority has the right to display in his or her minority language signs , inscriptions and other information of a private nature visible to the public ** . 
  3 in areas traditionally inhabited by substantial numbers of persons belonging to a national minority , the parties shall endeavour , in the framework of their legal system , including , where appropriate , agreements with other states , and taking into account their specific conditions , to ** display traditional local names , street names and other topographical indications intended for the public also in the minority language ** when there is a sufficient demand for such indications . 
   speak `` po prostu '' lithuanian nationalistic propaganda , it 's maybe dialectical but it 's still polish language, 
  but it 's normal thing that minorites have right to surnames and street signs in their mother tongue, 
  is president of estonia capable of creating new ministries ? 
  i think cleese can have couple ideas ... 
  i was talking about russian victims . 
  large majority of people killed by stalin were soviet citizens, 
   who was an internationalist well to be fair , stalin was internationalist when it was good for him , and nationalist when it was usefull , imo he was just a russian imperialist just like alexander iii , cathrine ii and others , though maybe more brutal, 
  russian historical schizophrenia in unbelivable , man who killed more russian than hitler is sitll glorified , while in germany you ca n't even find bismarcks statue, 
  was there at some point idea to establish new capital of latvia ? 
  i mean since riga was a `` german '' city , you know like in brasil , usa , india and so on ? 
   since large part of ruthenian lands were acquired via marriage , that nobility was half lithuanian , half ruthenian . 
  not exactly , you talking about couple marriages between gediminids and rurikids princes and princesses ; but ruthenian bojars were much larger group , and they still maintain their ruthenian consciousness , and only difference were between catholix and orthodoxes , which after 1440 was irrelevant, 
  yes but must remeber that already in xiv century large part of lithuanian nobility was of ruthenian origins . 
  i think you exaggerate . 
  first of all gdl was n't lithuaniann exclusive and i fell that belarusian have equal rights to its historical heritage . 
  it 's much healthy than what ukrainians are doing , they basically feel like they are ancestors of serfs , peasants and so on , they do n't feel any historical responsibility and so on . 
  i 'm glad that today 's belarus does not try to build its nationhood on some `` social unjustice '' bollocks, 
  very offensive words, 
  i never said that gdl was ruled by non-lithuanians prior to union, 
  what about samogitian ? 
  even in preunion gdl ruthenians were part of luthenian nobility , they were n't only peasants, 
  ok thank you , so it 's than slavic languages , since as a polish i could hold simple conversation with czech , ukrainian or russian , but probably not with serbians or bulgarians, 
  sorry you talking bollocks . 
  that way we can undermine everything ... charlemagne was crowned king of italy but there was no doubt he was frankish , he even had frankish name and he never change it !, 
  you are just speculating , you do n't have any sources that can prove he was n't lithuanian . 
  you know ockham razor - the most simple answer is most probably true, 
  thx , unfortunetelly without a book i ca n't do anything with this . 
  btw i was wondering how lithuanian and latvian are similiar ? 
  i mean can you understand simple latvian conversation ? 
  well without modern school system it was rather impossible , until 19th century french people spoke several different languages and dialects, 
  well i know this . 
  and we must remeber that on of them was micha\u0142 korybut wi\u015bniowiecki , ruthenian of origins, 
  well to be fair there is no reliable premise to consider him to not be a lithuanian , well he was pagan , he had baltic name as his family and so on, 
  well without this book zinkevi\u010dius `` lietuvi\u0173 tautos kilm\u0117 '' it wo n't possible, 
  but there were parts of elite , for examples members of ruthenian families ostrogski , sapieha , wisniowiecki , chodkiewicz held various offices , among them of great hetman , the closest one to the title of ruler of gld, 
  well i am historian , so as long as i will not know the sources i find this map not trustworthy, 
   lithuanians were ruling nobility of course not , there was as much ruthenian noble families as lithuanian . 
  yes i know , but it do n't tell us anything about 16th century , proto-balts are far more older than that . 
  and all european hydronyms are probably from proto-indoeuropean times, 
  according to wiki page it was rather this man zigmas_zinkevi\u010dius , but i am rather concerned on sources of his findings, 
  i always wonder on what sources is based the second map `` area of lithuanian language '' ? 
  i mean it 's highly detailed , and i doubt we are able to gather sufficient sources for any part of medieval europe, 
  ah , ok i was thinking you were expecting some shitstorm, 
  it there really any controversy about it ? 
  you probably know better , but i read somewhere that in lithuanian 19th century histriography gdl was n't considered as a proper lithuanian state , i mean that after death of vytautas to modern national revival there was period of `` dark ages '' in lithuanian history, 
   we also dont really know if that dude was even 100 % ethnic lithuanian himself , same with other grand dukes . 
  well but it most probable they were balts . 
  but i know what you are talking about . 
  we have similiar historical problem with piasts , they were protopolish almost for sure , but there are theories they were vikings or great moravians . 
  we will never know for sure, 
  karl der gro\u00dfe , but it may be from latin carolus magnus, 
  you know china is claiming that genkhis-khan was chinese , so you know , it 's not that uncommon , 
  well nothing is without a reason , at one point lithuania abandoned gdl heritage , so it 's no surprising that they took it, 
  it 's a common thing for most of the east european language - in polish kingdom is `` kr\u00f3lestwo '' and it also derivative of charlemagne ( in polish karol wielki ), 
  i cant tell it from polish side , so we learn a lot about lithuania , obviously because basically since 1386 lithuanian and polish history are unseparable , but we learn also about lithuanian pagan history . 
  i see you point , but i read once a belarusian book on belarusian history , and it 's their offical colective memory, 
  ok , vienna maybe , it 's changing but all the pre-modern western historical narration is highly western-centred , with few extras from russian history ; it will eventually change if ue wants to be something more than a economic zone, 
  i find it interesting and pride-worthy that some events or figures from polish history are part of someone 's else historical narration , like ko\u015bciuszko for example, 
  probably not , if something from polish history is known to others it 's something from these : 1939 - holocaust - pope - solidarity , nothing more probably, 
  ah ok / s , i was thinking you were talking about something else , well i agree with you , it was n't only history of belarus but also lithuania , and even poland to some extent, 
  which one ? 
  could you link ? 
  from all antimated histories of various countries , i like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxlagbg9qkm ) the most, 
  who was she f **** in latvia ? 
  poland signed with ukraine treaty in 1920 and established border which was later unchanged confirmed in riga , and we do n't create new states because they already existed . 
  and in august 1920 there were 7 ukrainian divisions , so i would say it was decent force, 
  well but it was, 
  oh yeah bad poland  pilsudski decided on annexation when he realized than there were no good will towards federation on lithuanian side, 
  well we know because 64 % percent was voting , that 's a fact . 
  and yeah everything would be easier if lithuanian government had agreed on plebiscite . 
  but than it could turn out that even kaunas should be on polish side , 
  do n't you understand that 64 % percent of people took part in voting ? 
  even if some town of village werent invite to vote it made no impact on results, 
  `` 63.9 % of the entire population took part in the voting '', 
  on russian wikipedia the article is titled : polish expedition of red army xd, 
  i have no idea and i does n't matter , it was the first i could find . 
  my point is that you could n't just draw fair borders , especially in galicia, 
   results are not valid , as most of the lithuanians , jews and belarusians boycotted the elections `` 63.9 % of the entire population took part in the voting '' it 's valid, 
  you know that kiev was part of ukrainian people 's republic , which was recognized by bolshevik russia , and upr was in alliance with poland , and kiev offensive was a joint action of polish and ukrainian forces ? 
   it hilarious when poles bitch about lithuanians for wanting vilnius city but forget that population of second polish republic consisted ~ 30 % of ethnic minorities . 
  well ok , was there any ukrainian or belarusian state which we could give those lands ? 
  and if you have any idea how to establish fair borders on this [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/nationalities_in_second_polish_republic_ca._1931.png ) it would be appreciated, 
  we were talking about polish-lithuanian relations , and i just pointed out that in lithuania anti-polish sentiment existed, 
   even with union we would been jack shit before soviets and germans , stop dreaming . 
  it was n't win-win situation , it meant our loss of independence and probably again assimilation and national extinction . 
  ok and i respect that . 
  you maybe right and i may be wrong . 
  it 's normal , we have different views on historical events , it 's normal - it do n't give me or you right to call each the other `` nationalist '' . 
  i just believe that lithuanian nation would n't be extinct , but you may see it otherwise .
