  but eventually talks were carried out to 1922 year . 
  and as far as i know lithuanian diplomats were supporting the so called `` hymans plans '' , but all major parties were opposing it . 
  it 's not hypocritical , it 's just a fact, 
  well i am sure about wilno . 
  wilno was better in poland , gda\u0144sk without vistula basin was n't just able to reach its potenial, 
  yeah , you maybe right , polish-german state could be a great option . 
  in prewar era it could be hard to realize . 
  but today it 's tempting option . 
  first of all poland never occupied wilno , i can not discuse with you when you are talking prewar propaganda, 
  yeah probably . 
  but the difference what that economically poland needed gda\u0144sk and gda\u0144sk needed poland . 
  yes we were so bad , that 's why all minorites had represantation in sejm , own shools , parties and organizations . 
  lithuania on the other hand consider all of its minorites as `` lithuanians who forgot their native language '' and treated them like this . 
  with excpetion of jews of course, 
  well anti-polish sentiment was a foundation of modern lithuanian nationalism , you can not find an analogy in poland . 
  why you think that ? 
  well , probably if germany had won a iww then it would have been an option ( probably the only available ), 
  why you think that ? 
  ca n't you find a difference between union and annexation ? 
  it would be a federal state, 
  it 's a whole different situation . 
  i was just pointing out the difference between ceasefire and peace treaty . 
  no , we are talking about interwar era, 
  no i do n't think so . 
  you easily forgot about so called `` foch line '' from july 1919 , and about anti-polish lithuanian-soviet pact of 1920 . 
  moreover in my personal opinion polish people of vilnius region had all right to live in polish state , not in nationalistic anti-polish lithuania . 
  it 's just my opinion  you can not agree with me . 
  it was a ceasefire not a peace treaty , you should be aware of a difference , and this agreement do not established pol-lit border , but only a demacration line . 
  currently we had similiar situation in donbas , would you tell that both sides there are in peace ? 
  well this text is saying only about collaborators in poland and hungary , because only those coutries were mentioned by fbi cheff . 
  author do n't compare it with other countries , so i really do n't know how you came to that conclusion . 
  imo union with poland would be a very reasonable move, 
   peace treaty we never signed any peace treaty with lithuania . 
  i do n't know what you talk about . 
  great you agree with me . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  yeah of course . 
  but attacked from both sides we were still able to defend for 2-3 weeks more , if had fought only with germany i could imagine that we would have defended for a longer time . 
  and overall our future would be better under just one german , occupation, 
  well ussr was a member of league of nations and litvinov protocol, 
  well if you compare allegated polish collaboration in holocaust with any country , especially neighbooring , you would n't call it a `` glee '', 
  yeah , sorry if i sounded dickish, 
  i was talking about polish-german treaties against ** czechoslovakia ** !, 
  i was thinkg it was obvious, 
   vilnius are you talking about wilno ? 
  one of the prewar biggest polish cities , centre of polish culture and science ? 
  it 's hurt to argue with someone with so little knowledge . 
  what ? 
  blind shot , try something else, 
  well we do n't know this , we still had 25 fresh divisions , and warsaw was still undefeat , we must remember that siegie of warsaw ended in 28 septemeber . 
  of course we could n't win but we could fight longer . 
  if soviet had n't attacked us maybe romania would have been a better ally , and maybe we could have count on supplies through constanca . 
  well poland never signed any treaty with germany on this matter , poland acted alone, 
  well ok , i will not doing this , it 's just not a competition that i 'm feeling comfortable picking winners . 
  it was n't my point , i was talking rather about laws and rules of war and mutual recognitions between nations, 
  well that of course imo , but i ca n't find anything comparable in recent history, 
  poland and ussr had a non-agression pact 2 . 
  they also had a treaty which specifically defined act of aggression and who is an aggressor 3 . 
  the invasion was held without declaration of war 4 . 
  poland was still fighting with german invasion , after soviet attack the whole defence collapsed 5 . 
  it was a total change of soviet anti-fashist foreign policy, 
  from the east european point of view trumps 's triumph would be a tragedy, 
  one of the most shameful acts in the history of war, 
  well i 'm not talking about dna, 
  wow , ca n't you just translate the meme ? 
  and secondly why you consider it worth to post ? 
  they just banned internet , afterall it 's just pussies and cats, 
  wow television told me that something is beautiful , now it 's my opinion, 
  well as much as i know they were treated as a members of hungarian political nation , better were nationalistic schools , press , organisations of those peoples . 
  in comparison use of lithuanian , polish , ukrainian was outlawed , schools were closed or changed to russian schools . 
  moreover in ah the thing would getting better with over time , while in russia it was getting worse . 
  hahah , stupid mistake i was planning to write slovak , but i dont know why it end up german . 
  sorry , slovak of course, 
  yeah but as i said it before if you compare how minorities were treated in german or russian empire , then even hungary would n't seem as such a bad place . 
  at least romanians , slovakians and others were considered as a distinct nations , while in russia lithuanians , ukrainians were n't treated as such . 
  poland was de iure and de facto and occupied country since 1863 with a permanent state of war , central governement used a policy of a stong russification . 
  yeah i totally get this . 
  and i do n't understand why everybody is focusing on hungarians , i was talking about austria ** and ** hungary bearing in mind polish experience of austrian galicia . 
  link is not working in my country : /, 
  there was polish-slovak movie [ janosik : a true story ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467134/ ) , which was decent . 
  imo it was n't the best story-wise , but had one of the best pictures i ever saw in cinema , tatra in its beauty, 
  we surely should cooperate as close as we can , not only pol-lit , but also entire region, 
  oh , ok so you do n't get my point , i 'm talking about austria-hungary , the state which exists in years 1868-1918 . 
  what was earlier is whole other discussion, 
  exactly . 
  moreover as far as janosik may not be best example , since he was 100 % ethnic german , one of things i like in being polish is that we share so many national heroes or historical figures with other nations , ko\u015bciuszko , chopin , mickiewicz , moniuszko , kopernik , curie , conrad and many many more , all have very diversive background and impact not only on polish history . 
  it 's really great . 
  i 'm not sure about it , but i think it makes really exceptional, 
  why you are so biased ? 
  i understand that romanians do n't like hungary or austria-hungary . 
  but let 's be fair i think that romanians in hungarian kingdom had far more rights than polish people in russia and germany at that time . 
  so it hard to compare , and that was my point . 
  yeah i know , i was kidding . 
  i know he was slovak , but he was popular on both sides of the mountains . 
  moreover it was probably hard to distinguish between slovak and pole in tatra area at that time whatsoever , i mean the culture of polish mountainers was very different frome the one in mainland, 
  oh ok , you totally misunderstood i 'm not saying that it was a heaven on earth but it was at that time one of the most diverse and tolerants states in europe . 
  i do n't know where you from , but you are probably slovak ? 
  probably hungarians were more oppresive , but in the austrian part it was fairly good , i mean late 19th century is a national revival of polish , czech , even ukrainian movements , which were n't persecuted harshly by austrian governement . 
  of course i 'm talking from polish point of view , and my homeland was divided in three parts , and while in german or russian parts we experienced some very oppresive germanization and russification , in the galicia we were able to speak , teach in polish . 
  so that 's a difference .
