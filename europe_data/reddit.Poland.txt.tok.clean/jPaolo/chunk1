  i was joking ... : /, 
  silly west has to import their homophobia , but we , the east produce our own !, 
  very patriotic . 
   i have no idea why we 're . 
  i 'm myself amazed when some people show `` hate ? '', 
  for polish people when not even a single one ever touched him . 
  most of them are `` not that well smart when it comes to things '' though so i do n't mind their ignorance . 
  irrelevant . 
  just like most of my experiences with lithuanians . 
  generalisations are bad . 
   i do n't understand how can you view land which never was directly in polish possession . 
  simple . 
  there was a lot of poles living there for some generations . 
  technically kurds never `` owned '' or `` possessed '' some land but this does n't mean they do n't feel sentiment to specific regions . 
  wilno/vilnius was center of polish culture , science , art and the traces of it can be still found there . 
  even today poles are majority of the district surrounding vilnius . 
  it 's the past , now vilnius is properly lithuanian just like szczecin/stettin is now fully polish . 
   most poles i met on reddit are the ones that cry for wilno/vilnius . 
  and most lithuanians i met on reddit are butthurt about history of their capital , especially censuses from before the wwii . 
  whatever . 
  what facts can you give to debunk [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_the_vilnius_region#soviet_data_from_1944-1945 ) ? 
  it took soviets ' ethnic cleanses to lower percentage of poles below 50 % . 
  i 'm not saying and i did n't say that wilno/vilnius should go back to poland . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  i responded to your comment because you claimed that narration of polish government was `` we take your land '' and i just wanted to correct you that in the eyes of poland it was n't `` your land '' but `` our land '' because that 's how poles viewed it . 
  but you started projecting behaviour of other poles in this thread onto me . 
  [ good thing the perfect response was already made ] ( https://i.imgur.com/z6lmfzq.png ), 
  since interwar period many things happened , you know ? 
  it 's not me who 's butthurt here . 
  why do you think i want wilno back ? 
   because poland was butt-licking france ass in league of nations weird , i could have sworn that was because of wilno 's demographics . 
  putting your butthurt aside i wanted to say that my comment was about polish narration . 
  i 'm pretty sure the narration was `` we want our land '' . 
  wilno was n't viewed as lithuanian . 
  key-word : `` was '', 
  no , he does n't , he does n't even know what type of muslims are in poland . 
  today redditors , tomorrow terrorists !, 
  you clearly do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   `` today refugees , tomorrow terrorists ! `` um ... 
  calling every refugee a terrorist is worse imo . 
  it 's just loud racist minority . 
  ( although ~ 30 % rather than ~ 3 % ) argument is ridiculous , to show it i 'll change one word . 
  `` the polish have right not to have jews in their country '' . 
  sounds familiar ? 
  besides there are already muslims in poland , muslim citizens of poland and muslim ethnic poles . 
  it 's stupid and polarising while adding nothing of value . 
  why you 're using war-like terminology ? 
   nobody is pushing forced homogeneity . 
  except far righters explicitly saying they want their countries `` pure '' from `` muslim menace '' . 
   but the left still call us all racists . 
  do n't act surprised if you generalise and call refugee terrorists . 
  someone 's got ta call you out . 
  forced homogeneity is a policy pushed especially by the far right . 
  i do n't understand your post . 
  are you trying to tell me that literally calling refugees ( not `` immigrants '' , protesters used `` refugees '' ) terrorists is n't xenophobic ? 
  refugees in your country = / = foreign occupation do i really have to say this ?
