  however they pour toxicity into public debate . 
  no no no , your words in italics should posh high queen 's english !, 
  there are some creationist ultracathos in poland . 
  difference is americans do n't rape pillage and plunder like russians . 
  central europeans !, 
  corporations are perceived evil because they do evil things . 
  ... or overpriced video games . 
  for me - yes . 
  i snickered when i saw it first time . 
  \\* snort *, 
  bit too late imo . 
  that 's why i make comics about evil us . 
  americans are always fun . 
  he 's trolling roleplaying anti-pole . 
  notice the flag, 
  i predict sudden surge in latvian tourism . 
  mazowieckie golden mean master race . 
  so pepple can harass his relatives , duh . 
  this is what russians actually believe ^ ^ tm, 
  that was funny only in first week of invasion . 
  it 's okay , they were clearly nazi .

  christ of nations !, 
  central european !!, 
  i 'm not talking * just * about katy\u0144 . 
  every side except hungary and america . 
  i was n't serious . 
  one side is proud of genociding poles , the other is proud of genociding poles and has nukes . 
  what happened to famous russian anti-fascism ? 
  so that 's how government is planning to increase % of working women !, 
  i need to read up more about it . 
  really ? 
  i thought poland was richer ; i guess our `` poorer eastern region '' ^ ^ tm is just bigger . 
  english with french pronounciation and german grammar . 
  looks like benin .

  guys , remember , nobody persecutes gay people if they keep their deviancy to themselves . 
  too late . 
  it 's a meme now . 
  oh my , i wonder why /, 
  i will have finished my exam just in time . 
  if you do n't see difference between human brain and animal brain , i do n't see a reason to continue discussion . 
  good night . 
  developing brain is not the same as lack of brain at all . 
  ------ i was right about you being emotional about the issue . 
  you then extrapolated it and projected some of your experiences implying i never admit to mistakes . 
  which is false . 
   ok , why then underdeveloped , premature fetuses are being taken care of ? 
  because they have organs for example ? 
  like neuronal system or brain ? 
    i was right . 
   sure , as always . 
  you 're projecting some of your experiences onto me . 
  stop . 
   but about the developement of medicine no , development of foetus . 
   you have personal issue with abortion i was right . 
  there 's difference between prematurely born kids that can survive with medical help and embryo that 'll will die because of lack organs like brain , lungs , heart or neuronal or digestive system but i 'm not going to argue any more , you have personal issue with abortion and i do n't want to cause unnecessary distress for the sake of winning internet discussion . 
  what ? 
  where did you get this idea ? 
  there 's no logical connectiob between my comment and your conclusion . 
  a `` human '' ? 
  it does n't matter . 
  when it can survive outside the womb . 
  `` dependant '' does n't necessarily mean `` will die the second is separated from the mother '', 
   i am a libertarian who believes marriage should n't be handled by the state `` and that 's why oppose gay marriage , because supporting status quo will certainly help my cause ! '', 
  me too . 
  i 'm not supporter of abortion ban , but i think it 's necessary evil . 
  serial suicider got them !, 
  kazakh are just steppe russians anyway . 
  treating arabs like people is militant antisemitism . 
  oh , now i understand the whole sentence !, 
  no , that makes them kim apologists . 
  * ka\u0142 * now means `` feces '' but originally it was just `` mud '' or `` swamp '' . 
  now that you mention it ... 
   in case of war that 's not true . 
  the conservatives and social-democrats in german parliament would defend a nato member against a war of aggression , especially poland where there is a special feeling of responsibility for the integrity of the country because of the crimes committed against it . 
  oh i know . 
  but their actions during peace made us quite reluctant . 
  germany and merkel are n't fans of putin , but they value good deal with russia over poland . 
  so we 're team ameryka . 
  american troops in belarus ? 
   so would you rather be a muslim lesbian in poland or in russia ? 
  what does it have to do with personal liberties ? 
  like freedom of speech or freedom to protest that is notoriously violated in russia ? 
  but yes , as a muslim lesbian i would choose warsaw over moscow . 
   russia is not soviet union ( which was ran by , among other criminals , feliks dzier\u017cy\u0144ski ) . 
  and ? 
  germany repented their nazi ways , shunned their history etc. 
  meanwhile russia still refuses to acknowledge red army as anything but `` liberators '' . 
  moscow archives about katy\u0144 remain closed , not to mention russian behaviour about smole\u0144sk tu-154 tragedy was spitting into faces of poles regardless of the cause of the crash . 
  also if you think one pole suddenly makes rest of russian oppression even a bit of justified you 're nothing but a shill . 
  and it 's not even me who played the history card !, 
  you started this argument when you mentioned indirectly nazis . 
   i 'm sorry , let 's just call them ` extreme right-wing racist nationalists ' . 
  we got ta be politically correct after all . 
  that 's not `` politically correct '' that 's just `` dictionary correct '' . 
  treating polish neonazis as anything but margin of a margin is russian propaganda , it 's that simple . 
  i wo n't speak out about pravyi sector though .
