  that 's because the whole theory of `` stressfull b\u0142asik '' is idiotic theory made to shift the blame more to polish side . 
  practically nobody can give honest true answer to what caused the crash . 
  the plane was lying in mud for weeks , corpses sent to poland were uncomplete and mixed , russians were breaking the windows of the plane 's remains , etc. 
  it was their plan to stir massive shitstorm in poland and look cool and objective in comparison . 
  stop assumming whom i believe . 
  the dream would n't work out anyway , he did what was the best at times ( 20 's ) . 
  alliance with lithuania would n't be worth losing one of biggest polish cities . 
   its stupid to look at the time with the morals we have today maybe if you 're talking about medieval times , interbellum was only decades ago , morality was pretty the same as today . 
  so , no . 
  you 're talking about pi\u0142sudski 's achievements during the war and early times , why ? 
  i 'm not arguing that ; you missed my point . 
  typical excuse with no base, 
  oh god , people do believe . 
  i di n't believe the alternative was a civil war . 
  economy is n't everything and even the claim sanacja helped economy is dubious . 
  good military skills and charisma do n't make one a good ruler during times of peace . 
  i can be thankful to pi\u0142sudski for independence while criticising what he did after . 
  while he was great for the fighting part , he then fucked up by installing opportunistic authoritarian defective government under pretence of fixing up poland . 
  not to mention oppression of oppoaition and dismantlic democracy . 
  he should 've stayed out of politics and be remembered as successful freedom fighter . 
  joining was the best thing that happened to my country in the last 100 years . 
  i love it . 
  he 's using satire . 
  the burgers !, 
  they 're everywhere !, 
  man , i love you . 
  it does n't have to be majority to be fucked up . 
  hitler did n't start with majority either . 
  they recently gave neonazis 8 % in parliamentary elections . 
  miniscule amount probably related to family ties or international marriages . 
  it ca n't be worse than slovakian , right ? 
  like anyone would migrate to slovakia . 
  slovakia has proved that very clearly . 
  yeah , the cosmopolitan ones have already fleed to uk , ireland , germany or holland . 
  that 's because asia and africa sucks , yurop is the greatest . 
  neither of them compared the danish law to nazi , just stated that certain commentators have such opinion . 
  the last one is political cartoon . 
  i see a lot of people saying that but i have n't noticed any `` big '' media throwing recklessly word `` nazi '' around . 
  golden dawn was called that way and sometimes pegida . 
  the same way `` marxist '' is overused . 
  practically not heard in majority of respected media . 
   have i been asleep ? 
  yes , and poland is partitioned again . 
   these days it seems everebody is a nazi euh ... not really . 
  this figure of speech is popular strawman but it 's just not true . 
  law and justice is n't `` far '' right , they 're normal right-wing conservatists . 
  as shitty and populist they get they are n't extreme , poland is just more conservative than the rest of europe . 
  there 's no refugees in slovakia . 
  no , it 's still `` normal '' extreme right but embracing nazi image rather than hiding it . 
  that 's not your usual extreme right , they 're led by literal neonazi . 
   illiterate savages you 're grossly uneducated . 
  we had only the english one . 
  ah right . 
  al those coulrand 's colonies !, 
  the exploitation of natives !, 
  bad latvia , very bad . 
  even the modern ones ? 
  says the nation where centre-right is considered left . 
  ... has nothing to do with anything mentioned earlier . 
  you 're delusional . 
  keep living in xivth century . 
   take constantinople back are you retarted ? 
  who needs sources if you can say `` refugees bad '' . 
  isis, 
  the judges are of course german shills filled with anti-polish sentiment . 
   islam is by far absolutely the worst of the religions i assume you mean `` worst of the great religions '' . 
  yeah , i 'd translate our `` czas zabor\u00f3w '' to `` times of the annexation ** s ** '', 
  it 's racist when americans do it . 
  what a complete moron you are . 
  were n't the unions `` watered '' down ? 
  a , i forgot about kp , thanks for reminding . 
  it was better for jews for sure . 
  in al-andalus they only had to pay tax , in catholic spain they were persecuted , killed , used as scapgoat etc. 
  before they got expelled from the country all together . 
  that 's why i said *** far *** left . 
  it 's not hard to find `` normal '' left . 
  it was part of [ dickrhino ] ( / u/dickrhino ) studies ' curriculum . 
  tbh al-andalus was probably better country to live than spanish crown after it . 
  yea , but i 've never met these * far * left unicorns . 
  even on / r/polska people are just left , left-leaning or simply anti-pis . 
  \\  poland \\  far left, 
  no , uk is evil . 
   you portuguese have a national day to be sad !, 
  do n't you have 8th july for this ? 
  the can is supposed to be opened in water . 
  or on wykop.pl and polish facebook sharing racist memes . 
  well , at least in english, 
  every comment that badmouths poland is downvoted on / r/europe . 
  that 's tradition . 
  it 's an image of middle-aged chubby man biting golden model of fish . 
  we should add the rest of the balkans to have nice borders . 
  silly eesti , you are russian airspace . 
  did you forget your secession from ussr was illegal ? 
   the poles gleefully pointed out where the jews lived . 
  people like that ( called `` szmalcownicy '' ) were executed by underground state . 
  poortugal is now honorary eastern yurop . 
   stricte catholic country only in the name . 
  there 's no `` hate speech '' mentioned in the article . 
  i know french and i 've read few issues . 
  yes hebdo is funnier because it aims at humour .
