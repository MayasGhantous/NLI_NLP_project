  i 'm not saying cyprus should get out of eu , just it 's geographically asian . 
  cyprus is in asia . 
  the only thing that counts is that we 're better than russia !, 
  so many new polandball characters !, 
   are you the lady from the infomercial that gets trapped in plastic wrap when she tries to put it over a bowl ? 
  there 's subreddit for this . 
   i 'm not talking about cutting pensions of current pensioners . 
  i know . 
   why is that ? 
  are n't they taught where the terms come from ? 
  briefly . 
  and they are n't taught about the origin of left/right distinction . 
  plus it 's very easy to hate on the left in poland as it 's associated with communist regime . 
  so you only need to link left with hitler to form an ultimate boogeyman that wants destroy patriotism . 
   seeing through and calling out bullshit . 
  any tangible thing ? 
  cutting pensions of childless people in poland would have cause deaths from starvation or lack of medicine . 
   of course it 's easier in eastern germany , were childcare is almost perfectly organised . 
  what other things former ddr does better than western germany ? 
  yes , these morons truly believe that putting `` socialist '' in the name of his party made hitler leftist . 
  it 's quite common idiocy in polish web too . 
   it 's not about accepting some refugees , it 's about sending a message to the eu that their immigration policy is wrong and it should be drastically changed , because quotas are not a long-term solution . 
  that 's not my point . 
   accepting the quotas is not only betraying your own people and the v4 , it 's betraying the entire europe to get some more money from mutti merkel . 
  and dealing with russia for more money from unca putin is n't ? 
  but what money can be better than euromonies ? 
  check the fireplace . 
   so far we are sanctioning russia too , while making the deals that would require braking the sanctions in order to finish . 
   does n't mean that we betrayed anyone you 're right ; just like poland did n't betray anyone when agreeing to accepting some refugees . 
   so why is hating/fearing russia is a rational thing to do not breaking away from the line of sanctions is hardly hating/fearing . 
   should we miss out on economic opportunities because hurr durr they are bad ? 
  no , you should n't use `` will never betray you '' rhetoric when you make deals with the country sanctioned by eu and is sanctioning poland . 
   so if we want to be friends it 's not enough that we like you and does n't do things that harm you . 
  hungary said `` no '' to hitler to cover asses of our government on exile . 
  that 's what historical friendship is . 
   we have to hate every country that you do n't like ? 
  no , just do n't make the deals that would break embargoes made by the political block you 're in ? 
  germany is n't in v4 and does n't have pretences to some historical friendship . 
   nato is the only thing holding them back , not hungarian energy deals . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is that hungary 's breaking v4 `` unity '' for some gaz-rubels . 
  i 'm not going to argue whether russia is a threat or not , that 's off topic . 
  oh yeah , because russia has no means to threaten other countries than invasion . 
  hell , russia invaded one counry , said `` nuh-uh '' was n't us and the world just rolled with it . 
  it 's no like they need to attack poland to get poland into war , if they f.e. 
  meddle with latvia . 
   you seem like an ignorant bitch who was fed anti-russian fearmongering in your entire life i guess we 're `` bratanki '' as long as we only spew shit at brown people . 
  your definition of `` every '' differs from the usual one . 
  i mention russia , because it 's relevan when speaking about v4 's `` unity '' . 
  i have nothing against v4 , i just wish it 'd be more cohesive on the problems other than immigration . 
   what should we do ? 
  not make army/energy deals with them ? 
   also you should understand already that russia is not an active threat , because you do n't have russian-majority territories and you are part of eu/nato . 
  hahahahahahahaha < insert futurama meme here , 
  except when it comes to russia ... 
  lol , the same second immigration is n't the main concern , all v4 countries say `` fuck you '' to each other . 
  have i to remind everyone about ru-hu energy deals ? 
  destroying poland obviously . 
   german humor [ polish humour ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/b8/8d/12/z19455928q,okladka_wprost.jpg ) for comparison . 
  our system works . 
   unless australia 's suddenly migrated very far north ... [ you 've done it last year , easy peasy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnxrxgyow8s ), 
  how that would even work ? 
  i was . 
  do you pronounce a and \u00e1 differently ? 
  polish use `` fejsbuk '' when want mock facebook . 
  how ? 
  '' \u017b '' at the end of the word is unvoiced . 
  and that way you mix `` masage '' with `` meat vendor '' . 
  maybe , but there are still differences in declensions for every rz / \u017c-type pair except for ch/h . 
  how do you differentiate accent in the speech ? 
   the bflmpsvz words what ? 
  but even jasie\u0144ski did n't do it properly . 
  but even his poem has an argument against him : how will you differentiate `` masa\u017c '' from `` masarz '' ? 
  it 's also a part of identity . 
  we do n't need to `` dumb '' down our language when american do it for us with theirs . 
  i fell like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/444uor/french_onions_to_lose_the_i_as_spelling_changes/cznsx4l ) comment sums up perfectly what i tried to say . 
  just switch ph/f to rz / \u017c . 
  excellent post !, 
   find me one language you meant `` one * natural * language '' i suppose . 
  these are homonymes . 
  because c was responsible for k sound back then . 
  because then our '' \u010d '' sound would be written * tsz * which has other pronounciation `` t-\u0161 '' . 
  are necessary to link the words with their declensions . 
  i boycotted the poll due to lack of grey poland . 
  somalia and angola . 
   - i suppose poland could agree on that !, 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  tfw when ~ ~ british ~ ~ french muslims are more pogressive than your country . 
  `` what if your son married a pillow ? '', 
  i know , it 's just that normally such comment would be showered in downvotes . 
  wow , it 's the first time i see anti-polish comment on / r/europe that 's not downvoted . 
  because / r/europe is a cesspool . 
  nice self-banter . 
   `` let 's shit on a new polish government '' if government is doing shitty things ... 
  [ yes !, 
  [ hm ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/real-wages-and-living-standards/?utm_content=buffer43065&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer ), 
  it was a minor push . 
   po - bad for economy any numbers to back it up ? 
  educate yourself on history of marriage . 
   marriage has always been a union between men and women false .
