   and yes , i would be affected when the migrants would do the same they do in the balkans or what they do in germany . 
  the reason why germany got events like the one in koln , is that nobody sorted refugees from ( mainly ) north africans and just let them all to bundesrepublik . 
  that means the only danteian scenes in poland would occur near odra borders . 
  so no , you would n't be affected . 
  spooky scary immigrants . 
  your life would n't be affected by it at all , germany may have problems , but the issue is completely overblown . 
  you 're choosing party of lunatic dilettantes because you 've believed in paranoiac scenarios . 
  single issue voting is cancer . 
  except there 's no evidence they 'd get even more refugees . 
  not really . 
   have advanced poison-pill amendments that would strip the law of most of its innovations . 
  like for example ? 
   we are ready to take more !, 
  yeah , that 's not what po said . 
  you believe in superstitions . 
  yea , a stunning 0,174 \u2030 of our population . 
  so it 's no difference than po . 
  pis agreed to take refugees . 
  sexual orientation is not a lifestyle choice . 
  educate yourself . 
  you have no clue what you are talking about . 
  i bet you did n't watch the spot . 
  that 's not how human sexuality and its development work . 
  gay people do n't make children lose their innocence . 
  and pretending that they do n't exist ** is ** indoctrination . 
  all of ue except sweden is in the opposition . 
  but think of homophobes and their feelings !, 
  how long are you going to play refugees card ? 
  pis did nothing about it yet . 
  i see you 're true memeoisseur . 
  some strange umlauts . 
  my mum told me not to speak with germans . 
  this has nothing to do about `` losers '' or '' ~ ~ victims ~ ~ '' `` victors '' . 
  we do n't translate `` gender '' so it looks foreign . 
  is this sarcasm ? 
  that 's how you write `` nineties '' in english . 
  you 're arguing with the statement that was n't said . 
  [ canada is 3rd safest country in oecd ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ ) , safer than czech republic while being heterogeneous society with about 20 % of people being foreign origin . 
  it 's not really about homogeneity . 
  that does n't matter , i just proved they need n't your yoke to unite their country . 
  that 's not ecact quote , just summing up your wall of text . 
  [ indians had unified before brits were literate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maurya_empire ), 
   yes empire was incredibly bad for certain people `` but not for me and that 's what matters . '', 
  america is just jealous of our culture . 
  worth a comic , hmmm ... 
  buckingham palace . 
  kaczy\u0144ski said that he wants to make `` second budapest '' hrre . 
  of course `` i did n't vote for pis/i 'm not pis sympathiser , ** but ** ... '' and then typical `` others did it too ! '', 
  while `` forgetting that : * po 's unconstitutional laws have been declared not valid until fixed . 
  this means these laws are n't enforced because previous government did n't argue with ct. 
  meanwhile pis ignored constitutional court 's ruling completely . 
  * po did n't make law that completely paralasyses ct in order to nullify it . 
  * while it 's true that previous government had its people in public media , they did n't dismantle institution that is responsible for keeping something more than state propaganda . 
  not to mention `` tu quoque '' is failed from beginning . 
  and polish !, 
  being `` politically incorrect '' is only good when you offend minorities . 
  pls invest . 
  the joke is on us , expecting sense of humour from guy who called himself `` poland4poles '' . 
  so american and boring ? 
  even more people come to mecca daily . 
   few thousands few dozens of thousands, 
  his conspiracy theories make me not take him seriously . 
  he 's both . 
  kek < - kek kek, 
   bosnia is the most dysfunctional country in the balkans , what about kosovo ? 
  maybe they thought that there is no hope for hungary and shifted focus on us . 
  \\  taking kolonko seriously he 's poland 's # 1 conspiracy theorist . 
  of course trying to dismantle the constitutional court has nothing to do with it . 
  procedure was made as a * response * to hungary . 
  no , believing in some `` german overlord '' propaganda spouted by government to cover up their unconstitutional rulings is . 
  po is n't progressive . 
  edit : to clarify , noticeable share of progressive electorate did vote for po . 
  however programme of po is just typical christian democracy . 
  highest quality kebap, 
  i was sarcastic . 
   what was the alternative , prey tell me ? 
  plenty of other parties . 
  4 new ones could be voted on if people really wanted change . 
  it 's okay when poland does it . 
  no , it was n't . 
  you better get used to it because this rhetoric wo n't go for another 4 years . 
  no , german tabloid owner owns polish tabloid . 
  and the mentioned tabloud is hardly progressive or under some `` liberal control '' . 
  ( please stop using this term this way when talking about europe )  also , when i see some irrelevant has-been attacking foreign country just because he does not agree with election results , i find it distasteful and pathetic . 
  except that 's not the case , the power-grabby gov trying to loophole our constituton is criticised . 
   as much as i know polish media was under liberal control . 
  so you do n't know much . 
  using american political terms only confirms it . 
  neoliberals did n't even rule for one decade . 
  no , they do n't . 
   kosovo broke away from serbia in 2008 it 's been 8 years ? 
  wow , feels like it was not that long ago . 
   the kosovo deal - the first since the war in 1999 - gives more powers to ethnic serbs . 
  those opposed fear it could make the kosovo government dysfunctional . 
  as opposed to violent protests i guess . 
  you did n't answer my question . 
  lem me guess : you 're neither black , gay or jew . 
  world is not only internet . 
  is not , but trying to somehow link tolerance of multiethnic and multireligious states of pl-lt commonwealth and of ii rp to current one is a fallacy . 
   poland has always been pretty tolerant lol .
