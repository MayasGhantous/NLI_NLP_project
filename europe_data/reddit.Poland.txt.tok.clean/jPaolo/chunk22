  plc and ii rp maybe , but prl and iii rp are on of the most closed homogeneous societies in the world rivalled only by japan and koreas . 
  [ you could have stopped this ] ( http://www.repostuj.pl/upload/2014/02/20140226185920uid2810_85300.jpeg ), 
  no , neutering constitutional court is a danger to democracy . 
   we 're really concerned about the freedom of speech are we finally removing blasphemy law ? 
  not really . 
  it 's mostly pr . 
  call me when you see things like this in ex-commie block . 
  that 's not bad thing * per se * . 
  dunno , ii rp was pretty authoritarian . 
   bolsheviks tfw you 're so conservative , you 're living in the xix century . 
  that 's not the case though . 
  it 's not a traditional polish value , duh . 
  after we get final result . 
  not this year , buddy . 
   you should not take seriously every statement you hear . 
  i 'm not taking statements like that one seriously . 
  i 'm just baffled , because such idiocies were n't that popular three years ago or so . 
  my point is that people tend to overlook economic progress and overall amelioration of quality of life when the spotlight is on the masses storming the borders . 
  recently i 've seen opinion that it would be better to leave eu because then poland would n't have too accept refugees . 
  insane . 
   make a comics [ i 've already drawn one two months ago ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tdlna52.png ), 
   i do n't understand . 
  they raised the vote pass threshold for parliamentary bills from 51 % to 67 % so that they requires more support to pass . 
  is this wrong ? 
  that 's not what they did . 
  [ apart from pis ignoring ct 's rulings , but who cares about constitution . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nnorp_83ru ), 
  it 's the biggest newspaper . 
  pis : the gift that keeps on giving . 
  this sub is pathetic . 
  needed that siesta . 
   it can give us a chance not to become completely colonized by our new overlords . 
  i see it works perfectly on the cases like serbia , albania and macedonia . 
   i 'm just calling you on being fucking hypocrite . 
  oh yeah , that 's the problem , not dismantling tk . 
  our `` independent '' media were first to call out hypocrisy on other but to notice that pis is n't so lawful and justice-y ? 
  they 're blind . 
  what this so called sovereignty can give poles besides smugness ? 
   and so did po that 's not an argument . 
  please , we 're not just bulwark , we 're the chirst himself . 
  human lifespan is about 80 years . 
  so no , apart from few exceptions all germans that were massacring poles are two metres under . 
   has the legals standing to outright ignore the new law while ruling if its constitutional i hope so . 
  they 're all dead . 
    it does not change the fact they broke it . 
   and now , after tk 's verdict , the constitution-breaking ** laws ** that po has made ** were deemed as null . 
  ** i 'm sorry , did you even read what i wrote ? 
   hopefully speak for yourself, 
   po broke constitution way before . 
  and now , after tk 's verdict , the constitution-breaking laws that po has made were deemed as null . 
  that 's why 2 judges had to be replaced . 
  pis ignored tk 's ruling and pushed through their own vision of `` prawo '' . 
  see the difference ? 
  ----------- i should just ignore yet another `` but po did it earlier !!! '' . 
  whataboutism and * tu quoque * is so popular these days ... 
  oh yeah , the life so better without eu . 
  both basically spoon-fed with dollars until hi-tech started to pay off . 
  how dense can you be ? 
  literally the whole thread is about how people protest about breaking the constitution , not pis ' victory . 
  there were no protests until they started dismantling tk . 
  number 1 in europe in martyrology !, 
  omg , evil gender ideology !!, 
  `` offensive '' has no meaning in today world . 
  anyway , now in media i only see `` czarnosk\u00f3ry '' , so the debate on `` murzyn '' is pointless . 
  i agree with this analysis but i do n't see how breaking the neck of the constitutional court can help with our economy . 
   yes , but ` murzyn ' or ` murzynek ' also are a derogatory not really . 
  condescending maybe . 
  no , downvoting you just hides a paranoiac . 
  we should just make jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski the generalissimos and end this presidential charade already . 
  oh , yeah , a lot of `` i did n't vote for pis , *** but *** ... '' lately . 
  because pis opponents are n't true poles , duh . 
  people tend to forget that poland is the christ of nations and can not do wrong . 
  no , it 's not . 
  uk is n't all europe . 
  i see , i edited out `` and the rest of '' . 
  i understand exaggeration just fine . 
  the problem is that you and far right treat it as a proper argument . 
   5 % of population  bazillion muslims did n't know germany has population of china . 
   you are forgetting about iceland . 
  i 'm not the first who did this , nor the last . 
  hahahahahaha . 
  we were the first democracy in europe after middle ages . 
  what is yoir flair ? 
  that 's even better . 
  it 's still better for poland . 
  that is for easter and weddings . 
  both . 
  show me one country recognised by un and that is not failed state , with ** absolute ** freedom of speech . 
  merkel is more competent than kaczy\u0144ski , so yeah , i would . 
  insourcing . 
  implying duda is more than puppet . 
  we have to pull a crimea to protect polish minorities in uk from their oppressice government . 
  what idaho has to do with genitalia . 
  seriously . 
  i 'm hanging out on european forum , discussing european issues and european news . 
  i could care less about `` american values '' . 
  i can argue about free speech and discuss varying pointsof views without americans ruining threads . 
  europe is diverse enough to have people favouring absolute free speech without your `` help '', 
  this is / r/europe , not / r/worldnews . 
  you wo n't find me on / r/idaho telling hpw the state should be run .
