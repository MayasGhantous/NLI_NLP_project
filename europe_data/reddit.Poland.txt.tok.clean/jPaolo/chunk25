  suddenly shengen kaputt . 
  how old are ** you ** to demonise nudity ? 
  that portuguese programme was n't even erotic or pornographic . 
  i just do n't see woman 's body as an evil thing . 
  god left us , people saw labia . 
  oh no , someone showed labiaplasty on tv , oh horror , truly it 's death of society !, 
  we were promised second budapest . 
  i see pis is already fullfiling this . 
  my nails have human dna too . 
  protest is ok in democratic society . 
  blocking access for other people is not . 
  it 's so beautiful that our countries share so much similarites despite some grudges from the past . 
   in portugal a child may be adopted by just one person . 
  there are of course prerequisites and an evaluation of whether one is suitable for parenting . 
  but sexual orientation can not be a factor . 
   therefore , even without this law , a person in a gay relationship could very well adopt children and raise them together with their partner . 
  the same in poland . 
  if any countries could be called pioneers here it 'd be netherlands and belgium . 
  well , that 's one ugly czechoslovakia . 
  holy germany !, 
  apparently europe ends at vistula hue hue . 
  fat chance . 
  like any muslim would willingly go east . 
  we have almost no muslims here though , so the `` lesser evil '' rhetoric is pure bullshit . 
  c\u00ff\u00ff\u00ffk\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4, 
  i see . 
  we 're least terrible !, 
  their leader wants to ban gay marriage . 
  not in poland though . 
  still fucked up . 
  `` these are not true muslims '' `` apologist propaganda !!, 
  btw , these are not true germans '', 
  this so fucked when people feel they should support parties wanting to strip off their rights in order to `` choose lesser evil '' . 
   what happened to due process and a fair trial ? 
  got waterboarded at guantanamo bay . 
  the reality i must live in, 
  these are awful policies . 
  antigay movement is the populist one in poland . 
  take usual ex-commie attitude and add staunchy catholicism . 
  appeal to nature is bullshit argument . 
  you see , you can have staggrring abortion rate , hiv infection rate , rampant alcoholism and corruption , have incest and still be morally superior over west as long as you beat up the homos . 
  so that 's why you made the great schism , you filthy orthodox dogs !, 
  no shit sherlock . 
  maybe they could try dieting to lose some of this mass . 
  not surprising as krasodarski kraj has over 80 % of ethnic russians . 
  maybe try comparing other republics . 
  i was n't implying that usa or russia are n't diverse . 
  no , not really . 
  it 's just that we read more about usa than about russia . 
  usa is as diverse as russia then . 
  i mean , it would be sweet ( nevermind if little patronising , usa is big and powerful after all ) if not the fucking assault weapon . 
  this looks like america preparing to invade france . 
  this is a very stupid and very american cartoon . 
  northern yurop is a grim , dark world full of mute autistic sociopathic introverts . 
  [ kinda like this ? 
   what lgbt wants is to get extra privileges , at expense of freedom of everyone else . 
  american liberalism is just social democracy . 
  yay !, 
  sex . 
  there was no `` duchy of poland '' after 1025 . 
  lithuania has the highest suicide rate in the continental europe . 
  numbers are inflated because of forever-splitting balkans . 
  comments crying about es jee doublyoos are `` controvensial '' and the top post are complaining about cirruption within ukrainian parliament . 
  they needed scapegay . 
  central !, 
  central europe !, 
  i thought it was standard in whole europe . 
  just imagine ... vodkarium, 
  spooky scary immigrants, 
  i have n't heard of similar things happening outside of uk-us academia . 
  what 's with anglo universities lately ? 
   they just wanted to add some authenticity to it . 
  are you even serious right now ? 
  / r/europe is panicking just like big minority of europeans irl . 
  / r/european is just neo-nazi sub . 
  literally neonazi . 
  just use multiaccounts . 
  mods will never notice . 
  ~ ~ finland ~ ~ kekkoslovakia is also eastern europe, 
  you clearly have no idea about neither poland or germany . 
  should she , should n't she , no matter . 
  you have got black supremacists in your universities and poland has n't . 
  truly land of free, 
  country of ** me ** . 
  i 'm also not big fan of immigration , but i like pluralism . 
  ah yes , / r/polska is also much better than the rest of polish social media . 
  maybe , but the point is : we do n't have png or nauru . 
  i kinda hoped for new mods , but alas ... at least there 's less literal nazis than on / r/european , but i do n't want that sub be treated as a benchmark . 
  that 'd mean slavery and human trafficking is right wing . 
  / r/europe is shit when it talks about immigration or refugees ( and these topics are 1/2 of the content here ) . 
  i do n't know if it 's because of brigading or youth 's shift to right , but it 's now sad true . 
  at least we are spared from `` cultural marxism '' , `` white civilisation '' or other ethnonationalist neonazi bullshit but it 's shitty consolation prize . 
  no , he 's not , he just dumps every migrant to png or nauru . 
  that 's just germany though, 
  happy kebap day !, 
  the rest lives in poland . 
  it was a simple jab of course . 
  polish president has less power than the turkish one , so even if we swapped them , erdogan would n't be so authoritarian . 
  you fail to read comprehensibly read my post again . 
  i was n't arguing whether turkey is european , just why turkey is relevant to europe .
