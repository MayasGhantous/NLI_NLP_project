  the question was `` why the news about turkey are here ? '', 
  thus appeal to moderators is n't fallacy , it 's the answer . 
   blah blah blah two lengthy paragraphs full of nitpicking and clinging to details . 
  turkey is shown and highlighted on the sidebar along with armenia , azerbaijan and georgia . 
  thus the news about turkey are ok to submit here . 
  eot . 
  i do n't have time or willingness to further drag this debate . 
  turkey is shown on the sidebar , that means the mods of / r/europe allow news about turkey . 
   after the fall of rome you can make that argument for eastern europe , but not the continent as a whole . 
  i can because at that time western europe simply * lacked * any city of the prestige of constantinople . 
  thus making it * the * capital of europe . 
  of course it changed over time ...  if you do n't presently consider it a european country then why does related news belong in this sub ? 
  because news about turkey are relevant to europe . 
  and why is that ? 
  because turkish history is irreversibly interwined with europe from the conquest of first ottomans , through the crimean war and the times of great war as one of central powers , to today postion of turkey as one of key nato members . 
   that alone does n't make them european though . 
  i did n't claim that turkey is european , only that news about turkey are relevant to europe . 
  why are you putting words i did n't say to my mouth ? 
  did you fail to read properly my comment ? 
   istanbul was never the political , religious , or cultural capital of europe . 
  constantinople was . 
  by having it conquered , turkish history is forever linked to the european one . 
   arguing that turkey should presently be considered a european country do you have some problems with reading comprehension ? 
  because that was n't my point ; i argued that news about turkey belong to this sub , not the where the asia-europe border should be . 
  neither of them is in possession of former political , religious and cultural capital of europe . 
  turkey can be asian country , but its history , culture , heritage and today events are intertwined with europe and relevant to this sub whether you like it or not . 
  wow countries with big experience on nuclear energy were supposed to build nuclear plants in poland , who would 've thought ? 
  typical far right idiocy, 
  your answer goes against the stereotypical image poles assume on ukrainians, 
  how do you feel about image of upa in ukraine ? 
  yay , we 're famous !, 
  you just indirectly admitted that nationalism is n't in common sense . 
  damned romanian bourgeois !, 
  i see russians like eurasia < -  gayropa dichotomy . 
  we get it , russia stronk . 
  nobody is denying her position as great power . 
  did you see `` what do think of bulgaria '' thread in / r/russia ? 
  2/3 comments are about treason , betrayal and traitors . 
  i see you like military coups, 
  because you had franco and we had stalin . 
  yea , fuck minorities, 
  i meant that i 'm not as economically left as razem . 
  i hope for diversity of parties instead of hegemony of one . 
  they create narracy of emasculated deviant gayropa and brave russia protectong `` christian family values '' . 
  just another layer of antiwest rhetoric . 
  satanic death metal, 
  they 're dirty commies for loving eussr 's eurokolchoz . 
  jan pawe\u0142 is love jan pawe\u0142 is life even if dead, 
  yeah , that 's my job !, 
  we 'd argue even if only the names were presented . 
  please , even i have some standard of decency . 
  as opposed to `` gayropa '' . 
  but what about scary muslims ??? 
  wonderful . 
  i 'm far-leftist atheist homobipanasexual trigender muslim jew member of iluminati and free masons of mixed brown-black race . 
  i just wanted to correct you : we do reproduce and we do it by infecting good healthy white christian boys . 
  like parasitic worms . 
   at least they will have no one to blame for their actions . 
  you underestimate polish politicians . 
  yes , but this fragment was n't about reproductive rights . 
  i did n't call them `` human rights '' . 
  i called them `` reproductive rights '' . 
   but whatever grinds your gears . 
  it 's `` whatever floats your boat '' . 
   i would n't consider joking about genocidal ideologies as satire . 
  it 's not the topic that defines satire . 
  here i 'll help you :  i 'll vote for together . 
  they 're too radical left for reflecting my own views but i think polish sejm will need some lefty counterbalance . 
  the bulk of my comment ------------  also i want maoism as official state ideology . 
  :p snarky , tongue in cheek joke . 
  ------------ sorry , but the only thing you 've unveiled is your lack of understanding the satire . 
  all `` independent '' media in poland freely and without any restriction talked about spooky scary muslim immigrants for the whole year though . 
  oh , that was after the debate . 
  before it , razem had 8 s of screen time . 
   i always wondered about the apparent awe of all communism-related ideologies in the modern ` elites ' . 
  because communism is the penultimate stage to nirvana . 
  chryste , how dense can you be ? 
   i do n't know anything of reducing the rights of women . 
  yeah , it kinda shows . 
  he meant abortion/in vitro and other reproductive rights . 
   their rights probably wo n't be reduced `` probably ''  in my opinion , it is an anomaly . 
  personal opinions what is anomaly and what is not , are n't relevant when human rights are discussed . 
  the one that killed 50 million people ? 
  the same one !, 
  kinda pity there 's only 36 mln of people in poland so we wo n't break the record . 
  i 'll vote for together . 
  they 're too radical left for reflecting my own views but i think polish sejm will need some lefty counterbalance . 
  also i want maoism as official state ideology . 
   and why is that exactly a bad thing ? 
  before orban became hot topic because of refugees , he was criticised for some press laws . 
  edit : i do n't remember it well , but i 've found some [ link ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/blog/press-freedom-loser-viktor-orb\u00e1n\u2019s-winner-take-all-hungary ), 
  [ paratroopers have good songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rahrhd2lcw ), 
  come on . 
  you out of all ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ central europeans should know . 
  all you need to know is that ukraina is rightful polish clay . 
  do n't you know ? 
  ukraine is artificial nation !, 
  [ jan pawe\u0142 ii was a great man ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/nonsensopedia/images/7/70/jp_ii_wielki.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121115135713 ), 
  we have this in poland but with john paul ii . 
   razem would be the real left razem - the left that did n't shoot to miners in ' 81 .
