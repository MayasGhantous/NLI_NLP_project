  polls in uk showed 50/50 . 
   i 'd rather live in a democracy ruled by * elites which * *** can *** * be held accountable for their actions * do n't we all, 
   at which time has politics not been done by elites ? 
  first years of communist revolutions . 
  you elected trump , it 's our godgiven right to feel elitist now, 
  according to reddit free speech is only good if it 's about defending nazis or holocaust denial . 
  i 'm all for limiting power of big corpos , but i 'd wish our gov would choose better case to fight for than ultranationalists complaining about `` censorship '', 
  well then fejsbuk does shitty job because you can see posts calling to murder muslims/gays/refugees all over polish internet . 
  why the law should be amended ? 
  there 's no conflict here , just another blown up #afera over poor poor nationalists/diet nazis persecuted by jewlminatis . 
  no , it 's just that `` not being a nazi '' is immensely valuable trait . 
  what a clown . 
  of course this thread will go the shitter once us redditors start to get active and tell poor unenlightened europeans how it 's necessary to allow holocaust denial or something like this . 
  fejsbuk serious business, 
  no , people being able to protest is necessary but not * sufficient * to be democracy . 
   racist , xenophobic , reactionary , islamophobic alone have been reduced to meaningless buzzwords just over the period of the migrant crisis no , they have n't . 
  it may be true for your inner circle , but not in the rest of the world . 
  we 're not that fertile . 
  this means that the power shifted a little more rowards the employees . 
  good thing . 
  oh no , whatever shall we do . 
  capitalism brought us prosperity , jeans and real coca cola . 
  communism brought us gulags and russian boot over our necks . 
  remember that when it was rebuild , there was much fewer cars due to communist poverty . 
  poor russia provoked to do evil . 
  they just could n't help but invade ukraine and georgia because big fat meanie us of a made them do it . 
  sob sob , so oppressed , so misunderstood . 
  bubble is fine even if weird , but it 's surrounded by unfitting glass-steel molochs that hide it . 
  soviets did not rebuild warsaw . 
  it was our domestic communists who ordered great national effort . 
  no * true * northern irishmen voted `` remain '' . 
  canadian standards would n't be an issue if you were n't annexe to the states . 
  i 'm pretty sure the main goal of eu in brexit negotiations is to keep free movement of people , goods and services . 
  21 century wo n't be polish , even if we had some potential , currently ruling rightwing populists are hellbent of dismantling it so they can feed their nepotist asses . 
  actually most of polish people oppose further restrictions of abortion laws . 
   and maybe poland polan relevant !, 
  you sound like being leftist and being europhile are incompatible . 
  you know what they say : you can go everywhere if you have both kidneys !, 
  or you speak german in public . 
  i did n't compare abortions to cars , just your `` logic '' of accepting every consequence . 
  yes , un recognised governments are n't set in stone . 
  that 's why taiwan lost its seat at security council and prc was recognised as true china . 
  we should not hospitilise car crash accident victims if they were driving the car . 
  when you drive the car you should accept everything that comes after as a consequence . 
  well , i 'm not this hopeful . 
  there 's no party discipline but it does n't change the outcome . 
  this has ** nothing ** to do with usa . 
  one of probable outcome would be forbidding abortions done if the foetus or embryo is uncurably malformed which is practically every legal abortion done in poland atm . 
  why ? 
  because we elected religious conservatives and for them holy zygote is thousandfold more important than mere flesh incubator . 
  which translates into practically backing up the bill . 
  united nations recognised tripoli government as legitimate . 
  eh ... no , not really . 
  i thought `` gender ideology '' - scare was exclusive to poland . 
  it seems you 're just unable to stop being demagogue . 
  blocked . 
   it 's not propaganda . 
  it is . 
  it 's reducing the dispute to name calling , to painting your opponents as murderers . 
  in the same way i could just call you fascist . 
  if you ca n't stop using propaganda language , it 's best if this argument was ceased . 
   every mother knows her child is her child hmm , i would n't dare say such words to raped woman . ', 
   you must be aware of your bias . 
  great advice , you should listen to yourself and stop using demagogic propaganda language . 
  i 'm not going to argue with propaganda . 
  just stop preaching about * understanding * if you want to push your newspeak . 
  spooky scary healthcare . 
  you say this but yet you use demagogic propaganda terms as `` unborn child '' . 
  i 'm more interested in south/north-west divide in former fdr, 
  just consonant sound . 
  it means `` in '' and it 's pronounced like `` v '' . 
  no , in my opinion chinese writing is one of most beautiful pieces of heritage in the world . 
  not only its rich history * in * the china but also how it influenced writing systems in asia . 
  fascinating, 
  but the writing system stayed kinda the same ? 
  thank you !, 
  it 's mandarin , right ? 
  i meant that chinese word ... 
  yes , i am . 
  what is this archais word ? 
  oh no , how could it happen ? 
  surely nobody could predict this !, 
  fucking refugges gentryfying berling !, 
  europe is not a country . 
  but this is about poland . 
  p-o-l-a-n-d . do n't project your country 's situation on another one . 
  are you a moron ? 
  why would n't you talk about polish women ? 
  all this thread is about . 
   and besides the purpose of 500 + was not demographic growth . 
  yea , you 're right . 
  demographic growth achieved by 500 + type welfare is less efficient than growth achieved thanks in vitro, 
  at least i do n't make up imaginary numbers about country i do n't know like you just did . 
  the same way an acorn is a tree . 
  calling [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vopmxtr.jpg ) a `` person '' is not wise . 
  that 's because abortion laws try to make clear-cut distinction where there 's none . 
  just like deciding that you can vote if you have 18 years but not 17 years and 364 days . 
  do n't you know?right wing 's hate is only good when it targets `` others '' . 
   arbitrary definition . 
  not at all .
