  personally i would just steal their jobs . 
  it 's about language . 
  go away nazilover . 
  do n't project your fetishes on other people pls . 
  which part confuses you ? 
  far right is always hilariously oblivious when it tries to attract gay community . 
  his post is controversial : someone upvoted it . 
  but , noooo , we 're not at all brigaded by stotmfront . 
  well , it should n't exist . 
  yea . 
  i choose neither . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  it 's like choosing between nazis and soviets . 
  how anout neither . 
  legal definition of marriage in slovakia does n't mention kids , am i wrong ? 
  i wo n't even comment this `` i have a gay friend ... '' clich\u00e9 . 
  words change their meaning . 
  oh we also pump cash into the church . 
  that does n't make marriaged performed by state a religious marriage . 
  how ? 
  do you have state religion ? 
  but now state of slovakia does n't perform religious marriages , does it ? 
  reptiles hatched eggs before chickens came to be . 
  :p anyway , slovakia has civil marriages , has n't it ? 
  and civil divorces ? 
  that does n't strike me as `` religious '' . 
  marriages were a thing long before religions . 
  you do n't understand , they 're * brown * literally 2spooky4her, 
  ok , on parlera seulement en francais, 
  for englishmen maybe . 
  upvoted because polish subtitles, 
  they do n't even need russia . 
  transnistrian army is stronger than moldavian . 
  correct . 
  implying it was dead . 
  whole polish counter-intelligence is infested with ruskies . 
  lol ` bout sharing values . 
  go away pls, 
  100 % halal . 
  for centuries europe was burning witches !, 
  lizardmen are n't smart , they just hypnotise people to appear more cunning and inteligent . 
  ok , feel free to continue deluding yourself that it matters how macedonia calls itself . 
  we need some humour on this sub . 
  that is not big deal . 
  greece is just embarassing itself . 
  surely citizens of former turkish republic of greece tremble in fear . 
  i would n't say 95 % but i know about russian influence . 
  huh . 
  did n't know that , thanks for the link . 
  if we had some language propaganda , kashubian would n't be recognised language . 
  the only thing i could find is [ old apelation ] ( http://orka2.sejm.gov.pl/iz4.nsf/main/53bb3976 ) unfortunately only in polish too . 
  apparently few persons could n't get their ids with non-polish diacritics nit because of the law but some software error . 
  considering it was 13 years ago , it should be fixed now . 
  [ text is in polish but the photographs speak for themselves ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/dwuj%c4%99zyczne_nazewnictwo_geograficzne_w_polsce ), 
  there 's no issue with omiting diacritics when mr \u017b\u00f3\u0142ty becomes mr zolty in uk . 
  no , i called your `` hissy fits '' about having polish language on the signs retarded just like i call fyrom-macedonia naming issue retarded . 
  every country in eu respects ethnic/national minorities ' rights yet lithuanian government acts like * kowalski * on someone 's id instead of * kovalskus * is going to destroy the state . 
  we also consider our language special and unique yet we do n't go full retard when some germans from silesia want to use \u00df or when czechs use tie\u0161in on our side of the border . 
  these `` lithuanians of polish decent '' were pretty sure about their polishness when i talked to them . 
  and why lithuania tries to be `` special '' ? 
  and you do n't have to lose your national identity to be citizen of another country , at least in eu . 
  both polish and lithuanian use latin script . 
  so some of poles * are * required after all . 
  this is great news . 
  bilingual signs aren ' `` hissy fits '' but standard procedure in areas with ethnic/national minorities . 
  lol at this `` argument '' about confusing tourists . 
  no tourist got lost on silesia , zaolzie or alsace-lorraine so far because of them . 
  you know , maybe if you did n't dismiss lithuanian poles ' and call their concerns as hissy fiymts , they would n't be pro-russian today . 
  i apologise , i did n't specify what actions , i did n't mean the one in the article but the one with bilingual signs and names on ids . 
  i always liked lithuanian folk songs . 
  lithuanian government 's actions do n't help . 
  i 'm not going to argue with anecdotal evidence , lol . 
  we tend to `` settle '' in uk , usa , ireland and germany . 
  iceland and norway are `` temporary '' . 
  we make savings there and come back to poland to spend it . 
  of course they have , you racists like to beat the dwad horse like no one else . 
  it was , now it 's about 3 % of ukrainians . 
  no , we should stop using old `` jokes '' about `` enriching '' . 
  also the only arab country without age of consent being at least 14 years are saudis . 
  fucking educate yourself . 
  we do have immigrants . 
  apart from recent influx of ukrainians we have vietnamese minority that came to poland during commie-times . 
  of course , that does n't make us cosmopolital , but still . 
  i noticed too that irl ther 's less shit , but i was talking about the internet . 
  hmm , maybe you 're right . 
  can you recommend some better portals ? 
  filled with typical polish-catholic love and compassion . 
  `` b-but we do n't behead people !, 
  that must mean everything 's alright ! '', 
  i 'm going to stop right there and kindly ask you to fuck off . 
  i have experience with poles and as much as they do n't want to admit it , their stances on society is n't that different from the muslims ' . 
  maybe it is overused by some muslims the same way defamation league seesantisemitism anywhere . 
  and if i see someone telling that all muslims should get out of europe , that they all ca n't wait to behead and rape people , if i see vandalised mosques , i do have a valid reason . 
  yes , excepting other countries to contribute more to eu than sucking off money is literally ' 39 . 
  comments on onet.pl , wykop.pl , `` independent media '' websites . 
  maybe it 's better on gazeta.pl , i do n't know, 
  islamophobia is more than just `` not liking religion '' . 
  honestly ? 
  the syrian . 
  maybe not other arabs , but poles in general are at best `` brogressive '' .
