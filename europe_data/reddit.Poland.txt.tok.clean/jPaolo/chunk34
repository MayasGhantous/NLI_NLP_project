  yeah , that 's certainly does n't solve problem of hate speech . 
  i wonder what reaction would be if they only censored pro-isis content . 
  i 'm too easy to convince ... 
  going from `` eu promotes free people movement inside eu '' to `` eu facilitated terrorist attacks '' deserves nothing but sneers and scoffs . 
   when did europe start standing for `` censorship '' over `` freedom '' . 
  hate speech laws in germany were introduced soon after the war . 
  poland got her in '97 when we finally agreed on the constitution . 
   typical response . 
  yes , typical response for conspiracy theories going wild is posting them to / r/conspiratard or / r/topmindsofreddit , not delve into rabbit 's hole . 
  [ voltaire did n't say that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kevin_alfred_strom#misattributed_and_misquoted_quotation ), 
   terrorist attacks facilitated by the eu oh thank you for showing me there 's no point continuing this , i can cut off this comment chain already after the first response . 
   so why is it so hard for people to distinguish them you say that all over the thread , but some people ( probably downvoted and hidden ) have been saying the definitions . 
  they vary in europe . 
   companies are forced to make this decision and there is a strong incentive to be overly cautious as to not get fined . 
  i agree . 
  yes , courts decide * if * violation has been committed , but the definition , deciding * what * is such violation is decided by law . 
  i 'm not happy but this situation , but hate speech is generally well defined , although it can vary from country to country . 
   not one person has defined it for anyone they 're literally defined by hate speech laws . 
  hate speech laws are defined by local governments . 
  just google `` x hate speech laws '' and in the place of x put denmark , uk , germany , france , slovenia , bulgaria , italy etc. 
  every time i gain little hope about this sub , a thread about refugees/immigrants shows up . 
  france benefits greatly from eu . 
  and without uk , the french-german duumvirate is even more attractive for them . 
  of course !, 
  that 's retarded . 
  well , nobody can topple this . 
  you just need to make another ocean on the south , why settle just for a tiny wall ? 
  it 's easy to love minorities when you can cherry-pick you want and have huge oceans and frozen wasteland to secure the borders . 
  usians typically fetishise their vague sense of ancestry . 
  calling out racism is n't racist ffs, 
  what a healthy mindset . 
  this is your brain on ukip, 
  my third cousin is linked to poland which is linked to nato which is linked to usa who has nuclear weapons !, 
  my third cousin threatened destruction of europe too !, 
  brb , got ta spam the sub . 
  it 's executivemonkey , our / r/europe 's favourite yankee . 
  wow , what fucking surprise , nobody had seen it coming . 
  not the euromonies !, 
  we still `` react '' to decades if commie propaganda . 
  give it 30 years or so, 
  those nato fascists of course !, 
  watch his video about pope and read the original pope 's message . 
  edit : the guy 's also climate change denialist . 
   but comparing him to nazi i 'm not comparing him to nazi , just his manipulating ways of lying . 
   triggered as fuck . 
  fuck off you unoriginal piece of fecal mater repeating shitty memes like your life depended on it . 
  sorry , forgot how many romanians are in this thread . 
  you did n't adress his point but attacked his country/nationality basing on flair . 
  it 's what they 'd show in the dictionary under `` ad hominem '' . 
  no prob bosnia . 
  his last video about pope is goebbles-like manipulation . 
  and keep these `` triggered '' jokes to where they came from : your ass . 
  that youtube guy you linked is worthless lying sack of shite . 
  just like ~ ~ serbia ~ ~ former turkish eliyat of belgrade . 
  i did n't know we have hooliganism diversity in poland !, 
  social democracy is n't socialism . 
  and austrian politics still have nothing to do with venezuela . 
  austria is n't socialist and has shit to do with venezuela . 
  read the article : it 's about the rise of relative poverty , inequality . 
  exact opposite of what socialists wanted . 
  katowice was renamed as stalinogr\u00f3d for some time . 
  i hope police will kill another ones extra . 
  it was n't anything to close . 
  humanity will be space-faring empire and the germans will still hear jokes about wwii . 
  i was joking . `, 
  it is . 
  but for the time being , send them to bankrupt greece ? 
  so you prefer she pressured the judges ? 
  so germany should 've sent them to greece ? 
  she did n't have any influence over the verdict, 
  so egalitarianism is now far left ? 
  ... no , just no . 
  just because they do n't adress the immugration issue the wayyou like does n't make them left , not even talking about far left . 
  neither angela merkel nor german government have influence over the courts . 
  fun fact : voltaire did n't say that . 
  you mean far right ? 
  in the other thread about lampedusa one romanian guy said `` why wo n't we just drown them '' . 
  currently at +10 upvotes . 
  or maybe because british are n't constantly called rapists , invaders , pests , animals or subhuman scums like refugees are called . 
  and you do n't see any difference ? 
  seriously ? 
  your fault for making them a country !, 
  he already said `` macaques '' . 
  using satan is unfairplay . 
  i thought you used electroswing ? 
  i was mostly joking . 
  everyone knows that copious amount of $ $ $ $ would open the gate in instant, 
  i liked your song but your niche of `` cute boys in simple outfit '' has been won by lithuania . 
  read the salty youtube comments under d\u017cama\u0142a 's song . 
  now multiply it by 10 . 
  they 'd pay millions of $ to beyonc\u00e9 and then lose to some ballad propped by voting blocks . 
  take your critique to ebu . 
  imo australia deserves third invite , 1st place by juries , 2nd place overall . 
  if there 's a country that will never ever * ever * be allowed to join , it 's usa . 
  europe never was `` homogenous '' , refugees or not . 
  i 've already told you why comparing provinces of one state is useless . 
  oh , the old `` yurop is homogenous ! '', 
  card !, 
  i see the discussion is useless if you spew bullshit like this .
