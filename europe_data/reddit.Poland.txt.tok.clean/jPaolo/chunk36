   the modern political spectrum is polarized between globalists and nationalists . 
  european politics are diverse . 
   you are the embodiment of the godwin 's law . 
  so predictable . 
  i never mentioned nazis or hitler . 
   i am not a rightist , i am a nationalist . 
  nationalism is right wing . 
  and i can twist your phrases in the same way : `` i bet you prefer concentration camps . 
   every time power changes , the winner fires opposition people from state jobs and installs his own . 
  thats a fact not in the scale pis did . 
  [ also ] ( http://static1.money.pl/i/h/74/art377930.jpg )  just cause your average right wing voter might have an iq of 70 , does not you your average liberal voter is more than 5 iq points above that . 
  but hey if media tells you that you are intelligent because you believe their lies , sure then you are really `` intelligent '' and even are proud of it dunno where did you get this from . 
  when i hear word `` traitor '' from a rightist i always think about bereza kartuska . 
   8 years ago when liberals won , they fired every conservative from state jobs . 
  lie . 
   they fired [ ... ] media owners from western europe lie . 
  only few hundreds of thousands people . 
  because the right to public demonstrations is only one aspect of liberal democracy . 
  pis are the traitors . 
  you can read about recent land law . 
  our catholics do it too !, 
  fuck off with your `` omnipotent omnipresent po '' bullshit . 
  one does n't need to be po supporter to oppose pis , one does need at least half a brain to protest against them . 
  even if you were egligible to vote in poland , promoting totalitarian anti-democratic regime is punishable by law . 
  communists and fascists are `` silenced '' by one of fundamental laws of republic of poland . 
  and it did help our democracy , not harmed . 
  it 's not about your `` right '' to comment , iit 's about not showing your utter ignorance and botomless idiocy when participating in the thread about country you do n't know . 
  just because they were elected , does n't give them mandate to dismantle tri-division of powers ( judiciar , executive , legislative ) or to fuck up with constitution . 
  and the cyclists !, 
  do n't ever comment on the issues happening in my country, 
  yes , it 's all one and same kebab . 
  fuck european commission, 
  shitty , but they swallow russian propaganda so i say fuck 'em . 
  very very bad mental healthcare . 
  psychiatrist and psychologues are overworked . 
  not to mention traditional neglect of mental health `` just cheer up and take up jogging '' and macho culture that tells men to `` man up '' and not to show their emotions . 
  jews were `` unwanted '' by communists some decades after the war after moscow ordered to hate israel . 
  the thought of sccessful eu infuriates people who know only hate . 
  he 's saying that germany has an `` experience '' and thus know how to mock fascism . 
  check again . 
  prussia is dead and germany is never getting that land back . 
   facist . 
  autoritarian, 
  look at this fucking czech whining that his politicians are not liberal enough . 
  slovenia in ussr ? 
  you know poland less than you think, 
  hungary has civil unions . 
  poland has nada . 
  i was n't telling which point of view is better , just that 's not a hipster trend . 
  maybe he meant governments . 
  that 's not hipster trend . 
  thinking that neo/classical buildings are the prettiest are majority 's opinion . 
  thanks for clarification !, 
  has n't \u0141\u00f3d\u017a stopped depopulating ? 
  i recently learned that we do n't have guaranteed mp seats for german minorities , it 's just minorities ' votes only need to surpass 5 % of votes in their district and they do n't need to have at least 5 % country-wide . 
  belarusian minority could also have their own mp as they are quite concentrated geographically but they have been voting for that one sld guy who apparently suits them very well . 
  mods ban this nazi pls, 
  yeah , but `` plebeians '' still have to obey rules . 
  srbija was right , hrvatska is nazi !, 
  one of most prettiest towns i 've visited . 
  most rural and poor area, 
  stop projecting, 
  that 's why we team up with orban 's hungary which does n't even get out of russia 's bed . 
  : / but you are right . 
  you did not discuss rationally from the beginning . 
  half of country lives in capital , the other in mountain forests . 
  most forested country in eu austria 's parking . 
  ljubljana 's old city is very nice . 
  so is koper 's . 
  trst should be slovenian . 
  czechia of balkans . 
   `` you are all anti-democratic if you are against the people 's vote '' same shit is said in poland . 
  as a liberal european i feel smug in the first place . 
  our prez is seen on many , many religious ceremonies , but his actual inauguration was n't religious at all . 
  when they added this possibility only few dozens of mps said it . 
  this election only a few mps did not . 
  about # 1 : it 's about how 70-years-old millionaire from new york can pose as anti-establishment figure . 
  what has n't failed in balkans , lol . 
  it 's not . 
  i think he meant the guillotine . 
  few things funnier than a brit telling french who is french and who 's not . 
  b-but what about ... 
  stop watching foxbartwars.com, 
   the term racist is thrown around so often now it is beginning to lose its desired affect of silencing people they disagree with . 
  this meme right here thrown around so often is also beginning to lose its desired effect of silencing people . 
  fuck off of / r/europe then . 
  nobody wants your opinion here , seal clubbers , go suck us tits like you always do . 
   nope , they wanted restict the places where journalists can move and film , they have their own place in the main room for filming and no one planned taking that away i think . 
  yeah , this ** too ** . 
  but they ** also ** forbade filming parliamentary session from the gallery . 
   afaik no one wanted to forbid filming the sessions - that would be a suicide . 
  but it was literally this what was all the commotion about . 
  they wanted to restrict transmission to only the goverment 's ones . 
  supposedly this change is no more , but i do n't really know what it 's now . 
  pis is not far-right . 
   pis proposed legislation which is similar to french , american and german . 
  germany , france forbid media from filming parliament sessions ? 
  `` facts '' ? 
  what what he said was untrue ? 
  where is this `` socialism '' ?
