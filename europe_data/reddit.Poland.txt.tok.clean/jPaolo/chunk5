  most of vysehrad recently joined russia 's funclub and czechia is oversized bundesland . 
  yeah ... no . 
  for poland this boom has 11 years now . 
  is n't karabakh ethnically armenian ? 
  no holocaust guilt . 
  `` all time '' . 
  you would n't recognise good humour even if it hit you on the head with a cludgeon . 
  learn how to take a joke jingoistic bitter arse . 
  this is n't first and certainly not the last time american did n't get the joke . 
  hit the nerve ? 
  implying americans have culture . 
  because i do n't want delusioned burgers to tell me bullshit about freeze peache ? 
  nowhere in my post i mentioned my nation . 
  when you start believing in `` trickle down economy '' . 
  * his beer-flavoured water . 
  what the hell are you talking about . 
  sikorski got brain damage from using too much twitter . 
  itt : americans telling europeans how their laws should work . 
   fuck democracy right . 
  subreddits are n't states . 
  and i already know how even 1,25 % of subscribers can spoil the sub for everyone else , i remember how / r/europe was before the megathreads . 
  holocaust made us this way . 
  apparently i 'm asian . 
  / r/european has less `` censorship '' and it turned into , surprise , surprise , cesspool of racist shits . 
  ban happy mods are better than sub filled with neo-nazist really . 
  i agree , it makes nice polish flag out of the smokes . 
  however it 's nice only in the picture or from the ~ ~ bird 's ~ ~ drone 's view . 
  should be `` christ of nations '', 
  would be much better without all those smoking and stinking flares . 
  fucking football hooligan culture is tainting all patriotic events recently . 
   as if poland being intolerant justifies the moratorium on honesty about islam . 
  it does not , but it also does n't change the fact you said some utter twaddle . 
  how did you get this idea ? 
  you know nothing john straight, 
  not even on pride parades ? 
  did n't know my country is islamic . 
  are you implying peaceful mother russia attacked ukraine , comrade ? 
  is this some parody ? 
  ~ ~ cock ~ ~ baseblockers !, 
  like blocking making nato bases on our soil so russia would n't be `` provoked '' . 
  lithuania always wanted to outpoland poland so it 's not surprising . 
  nuke it from space like in that james bond movie !, 
  poland did n't surrender like coward french !, 
  we just got utterly defeated . 
  totally different thing . 
  so they are n't . 
  just replace cows with fish . 
  when do you do your first of five prayers ? 
  so norway is canada of scandinavia ? 
  not german , they still did n't pay for kulturkampf . 
  both is hunting animals that are part of ecosystem for their meat . 
  whatever . 
  what faroese do does n't really differ from fish hunting . 
  just that salmons do n't bleed like dolphins . 
  in the end it 's always slaughtering living healthy animals . 
  they must pass the ritual of rainbow burning, 
  so much logical fallacies here . 
  i would name them if it was worth the effort . 
  mhm , just like all raped women . 
  it 's perfectly fine to berate traditions if they 're made by white people . 
  just another publicity stump, 
  turkey bad , kurds good . 
   those two were quite literally asking for it . 
  yeah ... no . 
  i said `` not all animals are bred '' , not `` no fish are bred '' . 
  they also hunt fish . 
   sea shepherd there 's few more annoying things than group of americans telling you what and how to eat . 
  people do n't breed all animals they eat - fish for example - so that 's irrelevant . 
  not really different from what happens to cows we eat . 
  meanwhile slovenia passess gay marriage . 
  battle of vienna was islamophobic, 
  no , random pole knows better than you what happens im sweden, 
  maybe is said towards everyone but not as often . 
  dreyfus and stuff . 
  i do n't know much so i ask . 
  that 's a biiiiiiiiit stretch to me . 
  of course nobody tells such sentences irl . 
  i wanted to express opinion not exact words people use . 
   the flamboyant nature of stereotypical gays which is fighting the strawman and basically saying `` pretend you 're normal ( i.e. 
  i just wanted to remind everyone slovenia exists . 
    there are other ways to do things . 
   what things ? 
  things like changing russian people 's view on the lgbt . 
  ------- oh , that reminded me . 
  is this anti-gay sentiment also true for belarus or it 's non-existent issue like in russian nineties ? 
  sorry , that 's too much english for me . 
  could you tell me in more `` compact '' way ? 
  i 'm asking because i 've heard antisemitism is seen as more evil ( probably not the best word ) than other western countries ( except germany , duh ) due to discrimination in the past . 
  the very topic of this thread for example . 
   that 's the case for most post-communist central-eastern countries . 
  [ ekhm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_slovenia ), 
   polish youth is very different from their parents yes , they 're more conservative . 
  but this time libertarian . 
  well , why in some way that 's true , we still have less abortions . 
  aww , are n't you adorable . 
  i always preferred polandball comics about russia & belarus than boring usa&c anada . 
  this is / r/badhistory squared and should not be taken as anything but satire .
