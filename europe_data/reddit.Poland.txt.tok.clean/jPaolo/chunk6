   why is this guy in office . 
  poles ask this question since 1989 . 
   myth number 2 : the soviet union repressed and killed millions of people i 'm done arguing with internet communists . 
  have fun in neverland of yours . 
  i did n't imply it does , just that poles have opinion on everything . 
  national quirk . 
   does n't matter what do i think . 
  that 's a surprise to me , in poland everyone has strong opinion on politics . 
  how do you think the conflict should end ? 
  well , i 'm not arguing about situation in ukraine . 
  i suppose majority of belarusians share your view ? 
  well , opinion on su is one thing , but there 's also cultural and political shift . 
  people are more liberal economically , domination of english in advertisements , big american influence , etc. 
  these two sentences are n't exclusive . 
  i would n't call this mentality `` soviet '' because i could n't define such term properly . 
  what i meant that while most ex-commie countries have changed their mentalities ( ddr , poland , czechoslovakia , baltics , romania etc. ), 
  belarusians i 've talked with could be taken straight from the eighties . 
  can i ask you a question ? 
  do you think there is such * ethnicity * as belarusians ? 
  southern one . 
  still more kilometres than yours . 
  at least lithuania have some history due not being artificial state like belgium . 
  but they also murder people . 
  of course they do n't . 
  they call your country belarus . 
  i meant mentality of the people . 
  [ maybe this comic will explain it better ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rss3r3a.png ), 
  death tolls , totalitarism , genocides and cults of personality . 
  that 's why giant swastika on brandenburg gate should n't have been destroyed . 
  it 's like watching insect in amber , perfectly preserved from soviet times . 
  we have dialects ? 
  i 've never heard any accent apart from silesian . 
  they see no-go zones . 
  they see increased crime rate . 
  they see welfare abuses . 
  they see muslim ghettos . 
  thanks , you 're very helpful . 
  * merci !, 
  * * ^ hope ^ this ^ word ^ is n't ^ rude ... 
  feel free to correct me . 
  * wo n't be translated to french due to embarrassment *, 
  is my french that bad ? 
  * but some poor souls do n't even have their own flag *, 
  we do n't have any papua-new guinea around . 
  central europe best europe . 
  i will . 
  it 's called shitty excuse of a joke . 
  what about canes hidden in knives ? 
  we 'll just keep stealing goods from germany until we merge . 
  europe ends on andorra . 
  nah , you 're just very northern africa . 
  with convenient nauru and png if it 's not working . 
  i know exactly what it means , you just failed . 
  eot, 
  right to marriage is a human right . 
  there 's no logic in your words either . 
  but i expevted it from the beginning `` let me play devil 's advocate ... '' is rarely a good sign . 
  you ca n't cherry pick human rights !, 
  i did n't label anyone as `` enemy '' just as `` not pro-gay '' . 
  indifferent people are just indifferent , but opposing gay rights just makes you `` not pro-gay '' . 
  easy to compehend . 
   when they may be pro-gay in other questions you can not be `` pro-gay '' if you 're cherry picking parts of `` being pro-gay '' that suit you . 
  similarly you can not condone slavery in one question but be against it in the other . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  i 'm offended anyway . 
  florida is that hot humid place with crocodiles , drugs and csi crew ? 
  nope , still not pro-gay . 
  you can not oppose civil same-sex marriage and be pro-gay . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  you are the degenerated one . 
  the american colony near taiwan . 
  yeah but being anti gay marriage does . 
  we can always declare war to us , surrender , gets annexed as 52 ^ nd state and gain that sweet homo rights . 
  really ? 
  this is great news . 
  well , you should n't . 
  seen it in poland but never tried . 
  maybe i should ? 
  i understand them . 
  they were expected to speak danish after all . 
  you ca n't kill people for crimes . 
  no , only for whites . 
  i 'm not talking about source here . 
  i did n't even comment on the article itself . 
  why is it relevant ? 
  last time we spoke you chose to ignore evidence because it did n't fit into your tunnel vision . 
  not today . 
  i 'd thought that 's sarcasm but i know my country too well to not have some doubts . 
  that 's racist !, 
  \\* blushes *, 
  all that palinka man, 
  i meant only the city , the poor rest stays ukrainian . 
  we poles have experience with corridors , do n't we ? 
  one more kitsch skyscraper and we 'll finally beat the krak\u00f3wek !, 
  maybe but opinion stayed :p, 
  soon lw\u00f3w will return to mater polonia, 
  in poland warsaw has reputation of being ugly mishmax of poorly rebuilt pre-war real estates , grey commie blocks and advertisement and billboard overload, 
  \\* pats two heads *, 
  \\* pats on the head *, 
  instead , confuse them for poles .
