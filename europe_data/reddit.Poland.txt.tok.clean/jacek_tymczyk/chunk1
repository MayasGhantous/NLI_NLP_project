ok , random person on the internet , we disagree . 
  my point is  baltics . 
  they are not eastern europe . 
  but the rest of the map is spot on . 
  they are west of greece , you know that , right ? 
  nope . 
  i would n't mind if you put the together with all the nordic countries , or together with finland . 
  but in one group with belarus , ukraine and russia ? 
  that 's lunacy . 
  i woiul definatevly that [ the state flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika#/media/file:flag_of_the_german_reich_ ( 1935 % e2 % 80 % 931945 ) . svg ) would be the specifical enough ? 
  almost . 
  except the baltics . 
  observation : all those swastikas in the article are nice and perpendicular in the * indian swastika * kind of way . 
  is my understanding correct that nazis preferred the 45deg skewed version ? 
  is there a reason for those swastikas being * straight * other then those people spraying them being just dumb ? 
  i think the main problem is that the swastika is the easiest thing to paint if you are a 12 y.o. 
  and just bought yourself your first can of paint with your lunch money . 
  it seriously is easier to paint then a dick . 
  the dick is definitely fun thing to spy on a wall , but swastika is both easier and faster . 
  you did n't read carefully . 
  all those gangs are supposedly irishmen with terribly ugly irish names who rob and pillage in england and then bring the spoils to ireland to use it to build terribly ugly mansions . 
  it 's even more like `` we know that it would be better for ireland to be back a part of the english led union , but since you disrespect us by not wanting that - we might as well not do that and then you will be sorry '' . 
  it 's a lot like `` you can not fire me because i quit '' :-d, 
  there is perfectly good english word for ireland and that 's * ireland * . 
  the irish word for ireland is * \u00c9ire * . 
  * eire * is neither . 
  you mean : those lists are stupid ? 
  sure . 
  you made an argument that was factually false and logically faulty . 
  spain can not give cetua back to morocco . 
  unlike the gibraltar that was part of spain before it was captured by the english , cetua was never part of morocco . 
  the most spain * could do * would be to give cetua back to portugal , but that hardly helps your point , does n't it ? 
  why diplomats should n't wear headwear in your opinion ? 
   they do the exact same thing across the sea with ceuta you are not even close, 
  is n't it true that almost every country was occupied by england at some point ? 
  ah , ok . make sense , then . 
  `` in europe '' is very unspecific . 
  first question : have you ever been ? 
  there is great difference between southern spain and northern finland , between some big city in germany and a small village in bulgaria . 
  if you 're never been maybe should check first ? 
  tourist visa is 90 days . 
  to move to europe you would need the right to stay and the right to work . 
  to apply for the work permit you need the residency first . 
  check here : https://www.eurojobs.com/blog/2012/03/29/eu-residencyworkpermit-rules/ if you have any marketable skills easiest way is to work freelance as a self-employed person . 
  all the procedures can vary greatly depending on the country where you want to work . 
  still do not understand what you are saing  but that would n't apply if another member could extend work privileges . 
  if i can charge $ n for a work visa to another eu member , why not do so and sell as many as i can ? 
  why would n't it apply ? 
  it 's not that , say , spain can issue a work permit for you to work in , say , greece . 
  spain can issue work permit allowing you to work for ** one specified employer ** . 
  was n't that you who quoted a document * eu schengen visa ** is not ** a work permit * ? 
   there 'd be no pressure on a member not to grant them . 
  you lost me there . 
  the core of the disagreement between eu and the uk was totally beyond the scope of my statement . 
  i solely opposed the notion that  you can not write a law that forces a future government to implement a ruling of the ecj . 
  that is utterly and completely false . 
  it is perfectly doable , as shown by an example of the current situation . 
  the uk is part of the international treaty by the name of `` treaty of lisbon '' and as a part of that treaty is subject of the rulings of the ecj . 
  if you were right , than basing n the same principle , the uk would n't be able to enter any international treaty . 
  none , whatsoever . 
  can we please stop treating it like serious political matter ? 
  the current polish government tries desperately to change a subject of the public conversation , even if the new subject is something mind bogglingly stupid . 
  yeah , russia tried to act tuff and come up with some counter sanctions , but somehow managed to shoot themselves in the foot , while they did . 
  tl ; dr it 's [ a joke ] ( http://www.wsensie.pl/images/bez-komentarza/02-17/4/globus.png ) . 
  and since the joke got popular somebody actually produced actual thing . 
  but still : ** it is a joke **, 
  what a mess !, 
  the tittle says it 's * bacon * . 
  the orginal article says * lard * . 
  and what you can clearly see on the atached picture is [ fatback ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatback ) which is neither . 
  yeah if you look at the position they are 6th , all right , but look the figures in comparison to the major magazines . 
  this is not the same league . 
  and they are ones taking the hardest beatings . 
  they lost like 1/3 of their sales year-to-year http://imgur.com/a/rtype, 
  well , however its obvious its far right not everybody must be aware it is not a major magazine . 
  keep in mind that it is a far right rag . 
  it 's kind of beside the point, 
  instead of buying in my local lidl i should have gone and done my groceries in one in england ? 
  what you talking about ? 
  nope . 
  i mean course the uk can do exactly that , it 's not allowed though , right ? 
  is n't the uk , while still in the eu , not allowed to negotiate any trade deals outside eu ? 
   you can use simple , broken grammar no , you ca n't !, 
  using wrong case or different verb form will change the meaning of the sentence . 
  that 's the hole point . 
   the present tense in russian is really easy no , it 's not . 
  at least not in comparison to english . 
  having to choose between * \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e * , * \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c * , * \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442 * , * \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u043c * , * \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 * and * \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442 * is ** considerably ** more difficult then choosing between * play * and * plays * . 
  it becomes second nature with time , true , but that just the point - learning english you can skip that part . 
  the grammar of the present simple tense is , well , simple . 
  you can be taught that on your first lesson . 
  you can throw in every new word you learn and make valid sentence . 
  on the other hand you have languages that have more robust conjugation and inflection , say , russian . 
  the mechanics of the * \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f * is significantly more complex , and you have to spend quite a lot of time learning before you can freely form sentences out of words , and actually say anything meaningful . 
  for english this bar is very low , you are almost instantly able to say something and feel comfortable about it . 
  what it means it is almost equaly hard to * master * any language , but does not change the fact that english is quite an easy language to learn enough to easily communicate . 
   j\u016brat\u0117 given that j\u016brat\u0117 monument in jurata is main image in wikipedia article on [ j\u016brat\u0117 and kastytis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c5%abrat%c4%97_and_kastytis ) i 'd say it not an accident, 
  yeah , we should just roll the red carpet because somebody used the word * science * . 
  urban planning exists for a reason as does protection of archaeological sites . 
   most of europe was homogeneous until quite recently .
