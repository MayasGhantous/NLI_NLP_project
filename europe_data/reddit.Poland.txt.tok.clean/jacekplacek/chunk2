  they sure do . 
  nobody 's gon na suspect his ancestors on both sides were fighting in the grunwald battle , though . 
  what do you think could give that fact away ? 
  how come i can tell dude from india from another dude from vietnam ? 
   do i know if they grew up in australia , europe , asia , africa , south america , north america , antarctica ? 
  what that has to do with race ? 
   it 's a bullshit pseudoscientific sociological construct hmmm , so looking at [ brangelina 's kids ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130906144457-joliepittkids2011-horizontal-gallery.jpg ) you would have no idea whose ancestors hailed from asia or africa or europe ... if it were n't for a society brainwashing you into knowing ? 
  nah , they are just better at not getting caught ... 
  wo n't really tell you anything . 
  for a decent experiment you need a bigger sample and a control group . 
   what do you think will happen to your karma !!, 
  i do n't keep track of it anyway , so i would n't really know ... , 
  would n't be much of an experiment , now that you spoiled it ... , 
  forgiving has nothing to do with it . 
  whatever goods russians produce are not very likely to be made by the same people who 'd sent my family to gulag ( they are mostly dead by now anyway . ), 
  besides , i 'm more likely to get my door kicked in and shot by a swat team than getting a visit from russian troops . 
  i have moved to the us long time ago . 
   my friends ' grandma spent time in a concentration camp , her newborn sister was murdered there . 
  my grandpa went through gulag . 
  two of his sisters an 3 cousins did n't make it . 
  sure , i do n't usually buy russian stuff but it 's because of low quality , not because of gulags ... 
  hmmm ... 
  i guess it was just bunch of radicals that pushed for independence of latvia . 
  the majority of people living in latvia did n't really want it . 
  agree . 
  there 's no champagne produced anywhere outside the one region of france . 
  not so with brie ... 
   it is nigh indistinguishable if they use the same quality of ingredients and process it the same way . 
  `` if '' being the operative word here . 
   at the high end there is almost no discernable difference sure . 
  it 's the every day stuff that 's really shitty ... 
  azog did ? 
  not sure which side of poe 's law you fall into ... 
  you would be surprised ... 
   chicago does not have that many poles . 
  [ guess again ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_chicago#the_polish_presence_in_chicago_today ) , 
   it 's better to have the smartest and brightest lead the country , only `` the smartest and brightest '' have no desire to `` lead the country '' - the most power hungry do ... 
  iow : democracy is good but only if the elites do the `` democracing . '', 
  it becomes bad when the _ hoi polloi _ have any say ... 
  if you were guderian , would you really put your forces in the basin , relying on the brits not blowing the dams up ? 
  yes . 
  it is awfully sexist of you to assume women ** have to ** share your view on the topic . 
  tat 's not a vodka where i came from ... , 
   which is actually just grain vodka diluted vodka ... , 
  whisky is just an impure vodka ... , 
  til `` santa claus '' means `` father christmas '' in british english ... , 
   do you know where montana actually , yes i knew that even before i left poland . 
   or dakota there 's no state called dakota ... if you refer to dakota fanning , she is from georgia ( state , not country ) but , no , i have no idea where she is right now . 
   would be unfairly prejudicial . 
  as if that ever stopped politicians ... 
   still an official state language so is french ... 
  well , at some time chicago was a city with the highest polish population in the world ... 
  not to mention `` to buffalo '' ( buffalo as a verb ) is completely made up . 
  this way you could take any other inherently plural word , make up a new meanings and write long string of it claiming it has some unusual meaning ... 
  that 's where yodeling came from : bunch of finns lost in alps called for help ... , 
  i know , you are a braindead authoritarian . 
  why ? 
  are you a government bureaucrat ? 
  get rid of the 99 % of the government bureaucracy and 99 % of the laws/regulations/permits / certificates/forms would be a good start . 
   somehow our politicians are always elected by those without brains . 
  that 's pretty much the norm around the world ... 
  that 's not smoking . 
  that 's liam neeson . 
   on the other smoking does kill that 's a false advertising - i 've been trying to kill myself for almost 40 yrs , did n't work . 
  hmm ... having a hereditary monarch as a head of state means a chance you get a psychopath is about 1 % ( the distribution of psychopaths in society , ) having an elected one means you get a psycho almost always . 
  funny how some people can not imagine not being slaves . 
  yes , as occupations go the soviet one was less brutal ... 
  they did not free poland , they just replaced one totalitarian occupant with another one . 
  just like the rest of the world ... 
  place where turks and greeks go to fight . 
  my neiborhood mugger loses about 5 grand a year to `` mugging evasions . '', 
  bunch of asshole evaders avoid the corner he is working on !, 
  < sigh /  if someone posted that uk is an anarcho-syndicalist country , would you really go to the trouble to find links for relevant terms and the actual political system of uk ... ? 
  simple google search can easily lead anybody wanting to know to the site like [ this one ] ( http://www.bcs.org/content/conwebdoc/18328 ) , making it obvious for even the most dimwitted ones there 's nothing even remotely resembling `` free market '' in uk telecommunication field . 
  and the `` bloody meme '' simply points out that fact . 
  i do n't think it means what you think it means . 
  it took me a while to figure out you actually responded in russian , just latvian ( i assume ) spelling . 
  my first impulse was `` what the hell , i can understand this . 
  i always thought latvian was not a slavic language ... '', 
  you mean they fought the english ... ? 
   in these time many people got paid no matter if they actually did any work or not . 
  there was this saying : `` they pretend to pay us , we pretend to work . '', 
  he knows , he 's just joking ... 
  i doubt it . 
  pretty much any russian word is a swear word in polish ...  plus whe throw in plenty of german ones . 
   enjoys smoking cigarettes , swearing , drinking beer are you dissing me ? 
  `` will no one rid me of this turbulent priest ? '', 
   but governments of the centre-left want to use the state and reign in the capitalist class to the benefit of the workers in the state whereas the centre-right will use the state to help the capitalists create more economic growth and will give less to the workers to keep them competitive and boost the growth . 
  ... and since they tend to alternate , and rescinding previously passed legislation is hardly ever attempted , the end effect is exactly what fascists would do ... more and more is ceded to the state and less and less is left outside the state . 
   how can you agree partially with `` everything in the state , nothing outside the state , nothing against the state '' ? 
  very few political parties leave a room to anything outside ( not to mention ** against ** ) the state . 
   in the economic sense fascism has a lot to do with using the state to reign in the capitalist class to work in the interest of the state rather than their own profit while still holding onto their property . 
  meanwhile worker organisations are directed in the same direction to work with the capitalists for the good of the state and quit their rabble rousing . 
  well , seems to describe the current attitudes of pretty much all states , does n't it . 
  fascism as an ideology lost . 
  fascism as practice thrives . 
  most of them wanted to fight , they would volunteer if not drafted - does n't mean the draft is not slavery ... besides that goes ** only ** for 1939 campaign . 
  after that they all ** did ** volunteer . 
   it 's called drafting , and it 's no different than slavery . 
  ftfy,
