  did n't say ** you ** cheered , said you were blind ... 
   i 've met a lot of americans as well as people who 've lived in america for years , who are comfortable to admit that they 're not very familiar with the american system of government , so they 're cautious to comment on it for fear of looking stupid . 
  i guess you are n't one of these people . 
  i could safely bet you i know more about `` american system of government '' than you do . 
  so , please tell me again that when the iraq war started the average americans were against it ... 
   you know jack shit about my opinions only as much as you voice ... 
  you are as blind to your country misdeeds as russians are to their ... 
  yeah , still more people voted for him than against him . 
  btw my `` ignorance '' steams from being in the us all this time - when he went after saddam all country cheered - the voices against war were very few and far between ... you might recall certain female country band 's problems when they tried to disagree ... 
  hint : 2003, 
  hated ? 
  he was still re-elected ... 
  well , they cheated on their spouses , not quite the paragons of virtue ... 
  you guys do n't feel like procreating , someone needs to work to feed your pensioners ... 
  i bet you the marginal patient who 's not getting the procedure ( s ) he needs will be heart-warmed by your explanation ... 
   people choose to beat their chests and be fascists that cheer invasions and war and oppressing people that are different in any way irony is thick here ... 
  hmm ... not too long ago your country seemed to be cheering for dubya ... 
  yup . 
  that was a dick move ( basically abandoning our ally ) and an incredibly stupid one to boot . 
  having a friendly nation on the east border might really have changed the history ... :( done by the nationalist government at the time - just another proof the nationalists are bunch of idiots and assholes . 
  if you are so scared , perhaps you should just stay in your basement , instead of advocating unleashing full fledged police state on everybody . 
   why do i pay attention to race ? 
  because that 's how genocide works . 
  race , ethnicity , religion , etc. 
  you have to target a specific group and kill every man , woman , child and old man regardless of whether they support you or not . 
  that 's a mark of genocide . 
  that 's what makes it so scary . 
  well , i do n't consider it more scary than randomly killing the same number of `` men women and children '' without any consideration of `` race , ethnicity , religion , etc. '', 
   the intent of ussr was never to kill whole races of people apparently you did n't get what i was asking . 
  why do you think killing less people of the same race is worse than killing more people of different races ? 
  why do you even pay attention to race ? 
  are you racist ? 
   there is nothing more horrifying than the extermination of an entire race of people why ? 
  is it better to kill twice as many , if they are from different races , than half as many , if they are the same race ? 
   anything out there that justifies vandalizing monuments to war heroes would you feel the same way if the `` war heroes '' were waffen-ss ? 
  poe 's law in action ... 
  sa formed around 1920 , _ kristallnacht _ was in 1938 ... they still have time . 
  someone who does n't worship tsar vladimir the greatest ( putin . ), 
  has to be an ukrainian , everyone else does ... , 
   at any rate - the commanders lying to people about the chances are at fault . 
  the commanders took out the ads in the newspapers and on the radio telling people about the chances !, 
  you are an idiot . 
   i 'm european nah , europe ends at the channel ... , 
  ... or any sex except missionary position between husband and wife ( and only if the goal is to conceive ) ... , 
   hundreds of tousands of people died . 
   warsaw was demolished . 
  yeah , and in case of the full soviet offensive nobody would have died and nothing would have been demolished ... / s btw almost all of my family , both on father 's and mother 's side were there . 
  the people of warsaw ** wanted ** to rise . 
   nothing was achieved . 
  sure , hindsight is always 20-20 ... 
  apparently , belgian schools teach history based on soviet propaganda ... 
   residing , uninterupted , for 10 years outside of the kingdom or the eu . 
  so if a dutch citizen resides outside of eu for more than 10 years they lose their dutch citizenship even if they do n't have any other one ? 
  and the children are punished for the `` sins of their parents ? '', 
  weird . 
  do n't mind them , you have to remember most of europeans are indoctrinated since the early age to fear firearms as the evil tools of death that have magical properties , like turning the nearby humans into murderous zombies ... ( unless they are their governments ' agents , of course ... , 
   so let 's just give everyone access to rocket launchers !, 
  hell , i consider fighter jets to be `` arms '' , therefore the constitution states i have the right to keep a fighter jet in my backyard . 
  actually , yes . 
  back in the time people did own cannons ( obviously no rocket launchers back then ) or even war ships . 
  as you yourself noticed , that 's a perfect example of what militia is all about . 
  the founding fathers were also quite adamant about not having a standing army , go figure . 
  `` on every question of construction carry ourselves back to the time when the constitution was adopted , recollect the spirit manifested in the debates and instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the text or invented against it , conform to the probable one in which it was passed . '', 
  _ thomas jefferson _ `` if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong , let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates . 
  but let there be no change by usurpation ; for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good , it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed . '', 
  _ george washington _ `` can it be of less consequence that the meaning of a constitution should be fixed and known , than a meaning of a law should be so ? '', 
  _ james madison _ ... if we are to cite the founding fathers ...  you do n't even state who should have the power instead . 
  beats me . 
  there 's a difference between deciding if the particular color is more greenish or more blueish and saying black is white , though . 
  because i 'm citing a poem ? 
  you have strange definition of a `` troll . '', 
  and this particular poem is actually quite relevant , esp . 
  the part i have bolded . 
  the scotus decisions quite often make mockery of the intent of the writers of the constitution `` mixing good and evil and blurring the line . '', 
  but i guess i must be a troll since i do n't agree with you ... 
  you who wronged a simple man bursting into laughter at the crime , ** and kept a pack of fools around you ** ** to mix good and evil , to blur the line ** [ _ czeslaw milosz _ ] ( http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/you-who-wronged/ ) _ emphasis mine _, 
  and if they refuse to say anything ? 
  you notice the constitution itself does n't grant any one body the power to `` interpret '' it . 
  it is pretty straightforward and should n't really need to be `` interpreted . '', 
  the supreme court itself gave itself the power , though ... 
  does n't make it constitutional . 
   unless you 're saying that the us constitution does not give the supreme court interpretative powers over what is constitutional and what is not . 
  can you cite the phrase ** in the constitution ** that `` gives '' the supreme court that power ? 
  did n't think so ... 
  yes , you can come up with plenty of `` doctrines '' to justify anything you want . 
  does n't make it constitutional . 
  there 's no snowball in hell chance of anybody who is `` nice , honest and smart '' to make it in politics . 
  to be a successful politician you need to be skilled in the fine arts of ass-kissing and back-stabbing and knowing when to do which . 
   korwin is an extreme right ultra-conservative uber free market party that puts donald trump to shame . 
  you might be not entirely objective here ... , 
   because as far as i know , fisa courts uses the `` special-needs doctrine '' of the 4th ammendment 's warrants clause _ `` the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . 
  '' _ do n't see any `` special needs '' exception there ... 
  ... postponing greece 's bankruptcy by a couple of months ... , 
   the girls were either committing fraud by receiving money under false pretenses ( a crime ) or planning to join a terrorist organization ( a ( arguably ) bigger crime ) . 
  so , which crime are you going to prosecute them for ? 
  or will you just settle for [ `` enemies of the people ? 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enemy_of_the_people#soviet_union ), 
  so , can you convict a sadist in a s/m relationship even when the masochist does n't press the charges ? 
  assuming you have the evidence of beating . 
   all crimes are against the state .
