  ** every ** system of government is set up to benefit the ruling elites . 
  and some part of the `` people '' is always getting screwed in the process ... 
   the opposition has revealed 30 rounds of ** wiretapped ** calls between government officials [ ... ] as most frightening evidence for wiretapping journalists and opposition politicians do i sense some irony here ? 
   which is politically impossible due to hostile local population . 
  as if russians had any qualms about local population before ... 
  the real problem is that while nazis and neo-nazis are quite justly vilified , there 's quite a level of permissiveness towards all the neo-stalinists/maoists and mao/stalin 's apologizers ... 
   isnt america like 90 % immigrants ? 
  is n't israel ? 
  yes it is . 
  it shows there 's not too many morons in poland ... 
  let 's face it : everybody spies on everybody else , always have and always will - only technology changes . 
  if some country does n't spy on some other country it 's only because they are stretched thin spying on others ... 
   this is a myth , social policies of scandinavian countries are the source of their wellbeing . 
  yes !, 
  we can tax ourselves into prosperity !, 
   federalism works in the us because there 's one american people . 
  it works in germany because there is one german people . 
  switzerland ? 
  spain ? 
  we exhausted our striking quota in the 80s . 
   how is deliberately starting ww2 instead of simply agreeing to germany getting back the territories granted to poland at the end of ww2 not disgusting you mean `` at the end of ww1 ? '', 
  that 's cute - perhaps we should give bulgaria back to turks ? 
   poland which was committing a genocide against the ethnic german population at the time . 
  that 's a quite extraordinary level of revisionism . 
  where did you get that kind of disinformation from ? 
  that 's something entirely new to me , and i 've seen a lot !, 
   claiming refugees ca n't be taken care of because they would need as much as a person still going through education is benign . 
  somehow i do n't think [ benign ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=define%20benign ) is the word you wanted to use ... , 
  you must be a pole , even if you do n't know it ... , 
  so , you 've stopped being someone else 's bitch in 1783 and become a great power around 1898 . 
  big whoopee !, 
  we 've been a great power since 1410 till 1772 . 
  and , as for being someone 's bitch - that was between 1795 - 1918 ( 123 years ) and between 1939 - 1989 ( 50 years ) , total 173 years ... seems you still have n't learned to do math , 
  nah ... we pollacks are plenty but still nowhere near 40 % ... , 
  ... and `` questionable medicaments '' too ... , 
   which removes a lot of disturbing layers somehow i read it as `` disturbing lawyers '' ... which i guess might be the case anyway , 
   basically the whole world ( minus china , india , japan , africa , middle east ) is european . 
  hmm ... the whole world minus about 80 % of the world 's population . 
  i like your thinking - now i 'm going to insist the whole world is polish ( minus about 99.9 % ) , 
   saying we have no history is just a pointless insult ok , so `` not much of a history '' then ... , 
   if young able-bodied men do n't defend their country , who will ? 
  if people are not willing to defend their country , perhaps it 's not worth defending ... 
  not to mention we were a major power when we were together ( + lithuania . ), 
  ... unless they have an agenda ... 
   the baltic coast in summer is warm `` warm '' is pretty relative term ... 
   complete idiot who knows nothing about politics , you should n't vote really ? 
  so if someone is a monarchist , for instance , and considers all the non-monarchist parties equally bad and does n't really want to learn anything about them , their voice should n't matter ? 
   is n't it objective to ask question about the current political system and parties ( general question ) considering you vote for them ? 
  what if i want to vote ** against ** them ? 
   definitely second biggest will be volleyball depends on what we are currently good at - back in the kozakiewicz days it was a pole vault ... wait , it does n't sound right in english  ... 
  although not guaranteed to work in every instance , statistically it 's a sound principle . 
  assholes would be getting challenged more often than the nice guys and would have a better chance of getting killed . 
   co2 levels have not been as high as they are now for at least the past 10 to 15 million years , during the miocene epoch . 
   [ really ?

  irish-canadian ? 
   to an ancap/libertarian i guess that sound rather like utopia oh , btw : i 'm not an ancap - they are too damn statist for my taste , 
  well , why do n't you apply the same argument to bread - are n't the only people with access to bread those who can afford it ? 
   functioning democracy where every voter needs to have an understanding of the issues faced at each level of government you must be living in some universe parallel to mine  in my universe most voters are rationally ( or not ) ignorant on politics/governments/issues , unless the issue is to their immediate benefit/loss . 
  bacon . 
  oh , and some other things when i run short of bacon ... , 
   the whole of society would be worse off if the taxes which fund them were somehow optional , or if they were ( god forbid ) privatized . 
  that 's what you believe ... back in the soviet union people believed there would be no bread if it were n't for government run bakeries ... 
  you are n't ? 
  deutsch , dutch - what 's the difference ... , 
   does war make people act like this particular commander , or is it just that it attracts the people who would have acted like that anyway ? 
  a little bit of both , i guess . 
   if by some definition by any definition . 
   you 've only proved that extortion is a good thing in those circumstances yes , ~ ~ some ~ ~ many people believe this . 
  it 's not a rational belief , though . 
  are you saying they are not ? 
  what about neither ? 
  in related news : cosa nostra is really looking into cracking down on hundreds of protection fee evaders ... 
   here there are poles literally defending hitler where do you see `` literally defending hitler ? '', 
  if i say being kicked in the balls is worse than being kicked in the ass , it does n't mean i 'm in favor of getting my ass kicked ... 
   `` when you see how people in other countries know their national anthems by heart , and sing them with passion and with joy , '' then you realise that switzerland has a problem , could it be the `` other countries '' have a problem ? 
  that 's where my confusion comes from . 
  why `` man-made '' and `` beaver-made '' are considered different ? 
  ok , so what about [ this one ] ( http://www.panoramio.com/photo/59265685 ) ? 
  nature or not ? 
  hmmm ... so , to make you happy we should throw some old tree branches on the top of our dams ? 
  yup . 
  all cousins ? 
  it has always baffled me what people do or do n't consider a `` nature . '', 
  why if the beavers build a dam the pond is considered a `` nature '' but when people build one it 's not ? 
  the problem with statistics is everyone sees what they want to see . 
  take vermont for instance - they have ( and have always had ) no restrictions on gun ownership and carrying openly or concealed , yet their violent crime rate is consistently lower than most of the eastern european countries esp baltics . 
  iow , as the saying goes , `` figures do n't lie but liars do figure . '', 
  also ponder this : in all the mass shootings in us , noone got even close to the breivik 's count ... 
  had to google ` contubernio ' - it 's ` conspiracy ' i guess . 
   that it was n't until after german reunification that he witnessed people who feared for their existence , beggars and homeless people . 
  sure , nobody in the ddr would dare to admit they feared ... and any homeless/poor can now get into the prison to be provided for - kinda like ddr ... 
  yup . 
  dictatorship of the proletariat . 
  but since the proles were not quite up to task , the nomenklatura took this burden upon themselves ... 
  still it 's quite sad/amusing that in eu people from countries which were enemies not too long ago , can cross the borders without even noticing , while the us-canada border looks almost like the old east/west berlin one ... 
  do n't feel too bad . 
  the happiest person i have ever met was a retard ... , 
   did i do good ? 
  perfect .
