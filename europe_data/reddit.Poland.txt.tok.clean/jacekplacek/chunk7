  oh , wait ... you were being sarcastic , were n't you . 
  nevermind . 
  i 'm pretty sure have they conducted a poll in sudetenland back then , the germans there would have been `` happy '' as well ... 
  do n't want to sound like [ banacek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banacek ) , but there 's an old polish proverb : `` the blacksmith was guilty but they hang the gypsy . '', 
  once undeserved - 1974 . 
  you won against poland playing waterpolo , not football ... , 
   they only add chaos even your cited pinko-commie-bastards politico article does n't seem to find any examples of `` adding chaos . '', 
  if you have just googled the topic , you could find plenty examples of people with firearms stopping madmen . 
  also you would find out the politico is outright lying on occasions . 
  this particular occasion included . 
  not every gun owner stops every mass shooting !, 
  who would have thought !, 
   so you 'd have 18 people shooting each other , just great . 
  looks like you are projecting . 
  just because you are not fit to handle a firearm does n't mean nobody is . 
   the guns did n't end the siege , the professional , trained , experienced elite armed force ended the siege . 
  ... three hours and 90 victims later ... 
  it took `` the police special forces '' over half an hour to even arrive . 
  another two hours to actually do something . 
  so , yes , i take a `` few likely drunk handgun-armed persons with delusional rambo hero fantasies '' already at the scene over the `` police special forces '' anytime . 
  are you for real ? 
  there were over 1500 people in the concert hall , if only 1 in 100 were armed it would make 15 firearms against three shooters . 
  chances are they could get the fuckers before they killed some 90 people ... btw , is n't it ironic the people with ** guns ** actually managed to end the siege ... so the guns helped somehow . 
  obviously , they are targeting potential victims . 
  god forbid someone could have means of self-defense . 
  kinda funny you were adamant the gangstas have to be counted but terrorist not . 
  worked how ? 
  after the gun confiscation the homicide rate ( after short upward spike ) continued the previous downward trend . 
  iow , no fucking effect . 
   europe has gangs too ever heard about olsen gang ... , 
  all three of them ? 
  you mean there 's a good chance she is not a psychopath ... ? 
  the closest to the civil war we had was a [ khmelnytsky uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising ) , after that we had too much trouble with our neighbors to ever consider such a silliness ... 
   kaliningrad it 's kr\u00f3lewiec for you ... , 
  asking for proof ???!!!, 
  inconceivable !!!, 
  how dare they !, 
   how many revolutionary/extreme political movements ( either from the far left or far right ) place bombs on the metro or attack concert goers ? 
   poland beating brazil in the football world cup final meh , we did that before ( for a third place . ), 
   history apparently the younger generations do n't know the history too well . 
  turkey was the only ( major ) country not recognizing the partitions . 
  at every international gathering of the ottoman court the announcement was made that `` the ambassador of lechistan was unable to attend ! '', 
  just a symbolic gesture , for sure , but it should still count for something ... 
   he probably was n't even radicalized at that time did the insight into eu parliament radicalized him ? 
  inquiring minds want to know ... , 
   if a child is n't mine i have no responsability to it , nor should i. 
  unfortunately for you , in most jurisdictions , if you are married to your wife at the time of conception it does n't matter whether you are a biological father . 
  well , obviously the comparison sucks - the high level hooker makes more money for 1 hour `` work '' than the mcdonalds server makes in a week ... 
   by the way do you live in poland , or in usa ? 
  usa , back when i was growing up in communist poland i had a certain ambivalence about the firearms , still since most of my family fought in warsaw uprising , i did understand how important being armed was . 
   they would be firing at crowds of people that have no way to defend themselves ... but you guys think it 's a good thing ... btw , i know several people ( one of them a woman ) who send that much down the range every couple of months or so . 
  it makes a lot of sense for them to buy in bulk . 
  it 's a good thing , is n't it . 
  that 's about 2500 rounds - you call it a `` large amount ? '', 
  can french stewardess refuse to fly to usa because the ugly ` mericans do n't allow bare tits ? 
   saint george was saint vomit it was too much for the dragon ... , 
   lithuanians say he was lithuanian to overrustle poles but he ** was ** a lithuanian . 
  his , arguably , most famous work starts with `` litwo , ojczyzno moja '' does n't it . 
  inconceivable !, 
  no , no , no !, 
  keep them in pln and invest in eastern poland !, 
  you ca n't really tell it 's brown ... , 
  it suggests you are a dick ... 
   one , for you personally , is to buy products that are guaranteed to be fairly produced iow , leave the workers in `` not fairly produced '' category without jobs ...  another would be higher minimum wages . 
  so , what do you think would be a `` fair '' minimum wage in bangladesh and what would be an effect of introducing one ? 
  not to mention , how would you go about introducing one ... 
   those are not the only two options so , what 's the other option ? 
   it is underpriced if the ones making the wares barely are able to survive on their wage compared to not having a wage at all ? 
  ... and still you want to be forced to pay more ? 
  nobody prevents you from buying overpriced stuff ... 
   originally , free market principles were the calling card of the left . 
  but that was a looong time ago ... 
  significant white space ? 
  the most horrible idea in programming . 
  can you imagine line break changing the meaning of the english sentence ? 
   french are far more likely to be unable to converse in english unable or unwilling ? 
   but yeah , the size of poland is an issue . 
  do n't see why . 
  the size of texas did n't scare the new england states back then ... 
  nah ... you have nothing on pollacks or russkies ... , 
  or , better yet , throw in a bunch of really fancy ones ( so they would go to the highest ranking isis ) with some polonium thread , not enough to harm the occasional handler but enough to screw over the wearer ... 
  i see you have missed a smiley ... 
  hey , you still argue with your neighbor who the ** real ** macedonians are ... , 
   pork is n't being banned . 
  it 's being taken off the menu voluntarily by some canteens . 
  same difference . 
  since the canteens in question are government subsidized ( government operated ? ), 
  there 's no possibility of someone offering the competition . 
  i do n't get it . 
  why is calling someone a groomer ( a person doing the grooming , like in `` pet groomer ? '' ), 
  considered offensive ? 
  hmm ... let 's see : suppose there 's also a `` significant minority '' of hindus , should the beef be banned along with pork ? 
  what about `` significant minority '' of vegans ? 
   like cultivated people do who is cultivating those people ? 
  and when is the harvest time ? 
  looks like estonians are the only ones that stayed put ... , 
   sahara was a desert even before global warming . 
  it 's normal for it to be a desert . 
  uhmm ... [ i would n't be so sure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sahara#nubians ) if i were you ... you can observe the [ temperatures back then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holocene#/media/file:holocene_temperature_variations.png ) were much higher than today ... and the earth together with humankind was thriving , instead of getting into doomsday the warm-mongers are predicting . 
   the same amount that would have died without ww1 .
