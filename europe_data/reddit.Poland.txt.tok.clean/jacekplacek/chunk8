  probably less . 
  some of them would have children if they were n't killed in the war ... 
  can not get more [ hippie ] ( http://en.wosp.org.pl//woodstock_festival ) than that ... , 
   there are probably some genetic reasons for this . 
  survival of the fittest !, 
  those gene lines with low tolerance of alcohol died out from alcohol poisoning ... , 
  no shit !, 
  does single malt count ? 
  i like this dude , 
  my question was only if you are going to ban them too . 
  that 's where the question mark was . 
  the other sentences did not end with question mark , therefore they were not questions . 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_medieval_weapons#blunt_or_cleaving_weapons] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_medieval_weapons#blunt_or_cleaving_weapons ), 
   the vast majority of people have no other use for guns but for killing people . 
  well , judging by the number of gun owners vs number of killings , `` the vast majority of people '' are veeeeery lousy shots ... 
   baseball bats and golf clubs are not primarily made to kill . 
  they 're quite clearly intended for sports . 
  that 's a relatively recent development . 
  through millenia they were exclusively made to kill . 
   the fact is a club/bat has absolutely no purpose other than to kill something . 
  otherwise , it 's just a hunk of wood/metal . 
  there 's absolutely no practical benefit to citizens owning clubs/bats other than for sport . 
  ftfy  when it comes to militias did i say anything about `` militias ? '', 
   you 're really not getting the difference between an object that can kill someone and an object made to kill someone . 
  seems to me it 's you who 's not getting it . 
  clubs and bats were made to kill people . 
  their use for sport is relatively recent development . 
   they are indeed primarily designed to kill someone very easily . 
  so are baseball bats or golf clubs . 
  and they do n't have any other use except for playing or killing people . 
  you gon na ban them too ? 
  the math would only make sense if , on average , around 60 people shared the ownership of one gun ... , 
   if it is your ` hobby ' find another one sure , i should pick my hobbies to accommodate fears of some jerk on the internet . 
  so what other hobbies would you like to ban ? 
  til `` shoot shit '' = = `` killing people . '', 
   why do you think i 'm afraid of the physical object of a gun ? 
  how else would you explain this  no one needs a hand gun or automatic rifle , unless you are in an army . 
  ** banning such things from public ownership seems perfectly reasonable ** . 
  btw , humans `` need '' precious few things : place to crash at night , food and water , clothes when they go outside . 
  that 's about it - everything else is a `` want . '', 
  well , the fear of an inanimate object is , by definition , irrational ... 
   err , which does n't exist . 
  wtf are you talking about . 
  what does n't exist ? 
  your hoplophobia ? 
  let 's see : irrational fear of an inanimate object ? 
  check !, 
  seems like hoplophobia to me . 
   because majority of gun deaths happen because people have guns . 
  yup . 
  and the majority of knife deaths happen because people have knives , and the majority of car deaths happen because people have cars , and the majority of beer bottle deaths happen because people have beer bottles ... 
  explain this timely paradox ... , 
   your extensive history of hoplophobia would also seem to preclude you from any unbiased debate about the subject ftfy, 
   in my u.s. state ( west virginia ) we have about a 55 % ownership rate , which works out to only 9.4 guns per thousand . 
  not necessary , there might be plenty of `` non-criminals '' owning guns they do n't advertise ... 
   in 25 years i have never met someone who owns , or let alone shot a gun . 
  ... that you know of ... 
  when you add up pistols + revolvers vs rifles + shotguns it seems to be a wash ... 
   neither woman ever claimed , initially , that she was `` raped '' by mr. assange -- rape being v\u00e5ldt\u00e4kt in swedish , but both spoke of the sex being unpleasant . 
  they both concealed their distaste for how it had transpired -- that 's usually what women do . 
  in the case of ms. ardin , she kept him as a houseguest for six nights after the incident , and even threw a crayfish party for him . 
  in the case of ms. wilen , she and mr. assange , after a night of sex , joked about the broken condom , and his promise that if she got pregnant he would move to sweden , pay off her student loans , and they `` could name the baby afghanistan . ''  she then went out and bought the two of them breakfast oats and orange juice . 
  ( ian fleming would never have allowed any of this . ), 
   ** when ms. ardin learned mr. assange had also slept with ms. wilen , and when he failed the golden rule of elemental post-coital communications , they locked arms and went to the police ** -- not to charge him with rape , but to see if he could be compelled to take an hiv test , on a saturday , in stockholm .

   the charge does n't appear to be bogus it looks completely bogus to me . 
   if it were anyone else if the charge is bogus , it 's bogus no matter who the subject is ... 
   he is still a rape suspect ... for swedish definition of `` rape '' ... 
  civilizations do n't die because the barbarians come , the barbarians come because the civilization is dying ...

   `` spain translates more books from english to its language in one year than the entire arab world has in 1000 years . '', 
  perhaps it 's due to spaniards not speaking english much ... , 
   just compare the amount of studies science does n't work that way either ...  ca n't be trusted and are in a conspiracy to steal money you with your `` conspiracy '' again ... nope , it 's a `` natural selection '' - the doomsday scenarios get funded , and published . 
  the `` denier '' ( btw , does n't it remind you of `` heretics ? '' ), 
  never gets the funds ( unless it 's from the evil oil companies ) and does n't get published ... 
   also , any evidence for this conspiracy ? 
  conspiracy ? 
  never said there was a conspiracy - they simply know which side of bread gets the butter ...  and why are the 97 % of climate scientists who say anthropogenic climate change is real biased , but the 3 % who say it 's not happening are trustworthy ? 
  you see - science does n't work that way ... 
   what agenda does their research follow ? 
  let 's see ... before the globular warm-mongering started the `` climate scientists '' were mostly obscure bunch , occupying dank basements in their universities . 
  then they `` discovered '' the doomsday scenario !, 
  now they are in a limelight and awash in government grants . 
  obviously , only the ones that preach doomsday and call for more power to the governments ... 
  i do n't disagree with you here . 
   the entire driving exam and showing you 're at least somewhat capable of operating a vehicle thing . 
  that 's the theory ... 
  in practice , depending on the jurisdiction , you can lose your license for things like not paying the fee , outstanding traffic ticket or ( in us ) not paying your child support . 
  all those things having nothing to do with your skills as a driver , but all impact the dough the state gets from you . 
  actually , it 's quite a rational conclusion - licensing does n't prevent injuring people , its sole goal is revenue . 
  they are nuts ... , 
   how many ** men ** were actually assaulted and dragged behind the bushes to get raped by women ? 
  / u/silverionmox did n't say is has to be men that get raped ... 
   therefore , cars , should not have a license either . 
  yup . 
  that 's the correct conclusion . 
  only when we win ... ,
