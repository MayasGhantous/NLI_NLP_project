  i was n't talking about oxford but about the cape town university where all this silliness [ started ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40rqsx/oxford_university_students_who_dont_like_cecil/cywo935 ) ... 
   statues of him are honouring `` the defender of the country '' rather than `` the ` orrible racist '' and the statues of rhodes are honoring `` the founder of the university '' and the `` benefactor of the scholarship recipients '' rather than `` the ` orrible racist '' ... 
   because the crimes where guns are used are far and few between . 
  120kg bully rapist does n't need a firearm to rape and perhaps kill 60kg girl . 
  as the saying goes `` god created men , col. colt made them equal ... ''  violent crimes are few and people do n't need guns to protect themselves another saying : `` better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it . '', 
  rip . 
  dude was one of the very few who could do any genre and be great at it . 
   you do n't need guns at all in a civilized society ... until you do . 
  but then it 's too late . 
  it 's kinda funny how most europeans think the police will protect them . 
  they can not do any such thing - all they can do is to show up after the fact and mop up . 
  perhaps , if they are lucky and willing , apprehend the perpetrator ... 
  obviously , when you are murdered with some other weapon , you are not quite as dead ... / s, 
   they 're morally fucked , but not dumb . 
  at least not all of them . 
  dunno ... the instigators are n't dumb , but they do n't do the deeds themselves - they rely on the dumb fucks to `` martyr '' themselves . 
  did you notice the imams who preach jihad are n't so keen on putting their arses where their mouths are ? 
   we never had to have amnesty after amnesty for the italians , perhaps because , back then , there was no such thing as an `` illegal '' immigrant ... 
  what for ? 
  she did n't say anything , just drew pictures - whatever the police imagined from those pictures can not be a basis for jailing someone ... 
   `` they are subsequently asked to provide information on other languages that they may know '' of ? 
  can the bar make every other drink `` on the house ? '', 
   a company has the right to sponsor whoever they damn well please . 
  and a government has the right to contract with whoever they damn well please , _ n'est - ce pas _ ? 
  belarus was a part of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ... 
   do you support free choice ?

  i would be all for abortion , if it extended to the time till the brat moves out ... 
   could you tell me why you consider it killing ? 
  well , it 's alive now . 
  abortion would change that . 
  usually , that 's considered killing ... 
   the future is awesome , guaranteed , and your life is great , and everything is working out just mighty fine . 
  hey , my life ** is ** great , everything is working out mighty fine to keep me amused and the future , i suppose , will deliver even more amusement ... the ( grand ) kids are screwed , though . 
   understand what `` islamist '' actually means you have any proof the dude was an `` islamist ? '', 
   changing of history and false claims ??? 
  it is in the ** region ** of macedonia , after all . 
  we poles do n't feel butthurt about belarus , even though parts of the white russia region are still in present poland . 
  neither east nor west germany did n't make a fuss about the other one ... 
  did n't think an explanation was necessary . 
  kinda pretty obvious - those countries used to be communist ( left wing , ) and moved to the right ( more or less . ), 
  left wingers want to move to the left , ergo `` to return society to an earlier state . '', 
  you are welcome to come . 
  just not with a very large ` tourist ' group ... , 
   left wingers are not reactionary though , they definitely are progressive , because they do n't wish to return society to an earlier state ... except eastern european/russian left wingers ... 
   productive nations do n't exist without singular language , til switzerland is not a `` productive nation . '', 
   if 2/3 of these people can barely read and write in ** arabic ** hmm ... since their native tongues are either pashto or dari , no wonder they have trouble reading/writing arabic ... 
  there would be new business opportunities for smugglers ... 
  back in the berlin wall times ( determined ) people were still able to escape . 
  if you think you can make borders air-tight , you are dreaming in technicolor . 
   that 's one convincing argument . 
  in my country people use it to argue against gay marriage . 
  `` if you allow homos to marry now , soon animals will follow ! '', 
  is n't that ** exactly ** what tfa advocates ? 
  just change `` gay '' to `` muslim '' ...  no one is redefining the meaning of freedom here . 
  oh , yes , you are . 
  yeah , let us keep redefining the meaning of freedom and soon enough 1984 will became an utopian novel ... 
   to protect our free societies , we must outlaw freedom ftfy, 
   are you in constant gun battles do you have fire insurance ? 
  are your home burning `` constantly ? '', 
  as the saying goes : `` better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it . '', 
  who knows , he might like that . 
  not if you are driving . 
   you ca n't really claim any of those actions were the result of left-wing ideology no ? 
  so what ideology were they result of ? 
   violating the human rights almost all european countries either have or used to , until very recently , have a conscription . 
  why do you think drafting natives is ok but drafting recent arrivals is `` violating the human rights ? '', 
  simple : accept all refugees , draft those who are correct age , send them there to fight isis ... 
   1948 without a doubt or maybe `` farm animals ? '', 
  close . 
  the ' \u0144 ' is soft , though , kinda like spanish ' \u00f1 ' . 
   snow is not a problem for opening the door outwards . 
  you just have to clean up the snow from there and if its fresh the door will push the snow out also . 
  that depends on [ how much snow ] ( http://hypervocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/best-blizzard-pic-copy.jpg ) ... 
   i like the arcs but that lion ( lion ? ), 
  looks like its throwing up . 
   ( it 's most notable with the polish here , where the fact we did n't do enough to help apparently makes us worse than those who invaded them ) . 
  well , `` those who invaded '' were our enemies pretty much all through poland 's history . 
  you were supposed to be our friends ... so , not `` worse , '' we were just disappointed . 
  and we really resent uk 's dick move of excluding poles from the victory parade , just for hope stalin would let you lick his arse clean ... 
   we live in 21 century and not in the middle ages you mean people in middle ages did n't like to fuck ? 
   the population in the baltic states were increasing .

  _ i 'll see myself out _, 
  you mean `` better red than dead ? '', 
  i knew joining the eu was a bad move for poland . 
  they even stole our messiah complex !, 
  you could n't get any plainer than [ this ] ( http://static.myvimu.com/photo/48/68464823_m.jpg ) , yet back then , pretty much everyone in poland smoked ... 
   singer which stated in one talk show that bible was probably written by dudes smoking weed and drinking heavily . 
  ... which is very likely correct ... 
  tsar crown ? 
  so , when a fetus becomes a child ? 
   uber is a fucking parasite .
