it 's actually pretty sad how utterly demonized immigrants are on the internet . 
  especially considering how many people on reddit are first or second generation immigrants . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  whenever i hear drivers complain about the tarmac , i think they 're just stuck in some bitch mode they entered 15 years ago . 
  you can see similar changes on roads here in poland between administrative districts . 
  it 's not really noticeable by car as it is when you 're riding a bike . 
  canned spray cheese , not even once . 
  we came in a little under 970mln . 
  i get that , but like i said : 118 $ mln/km * just for the tunnel * . 
  that 's still cheap as hell , the new line of the warsaw subway cost 118mln $ / km and that 's just for the tunnel . 
  total cost : 986mln $ for the 6km line . 
  pretty much half of poland 's new developments look like that . 
  the environmental minister during that government claimed we need to cut old growth forest in the [ bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bia%c5%82owie%c5%bca_forest ) to `` help it out '' . 
  this is a forest that has been around for thousands of years ... 
  i doubt anybody in 1989 poland thought they 'd be able to drive to portugal without a passport in 15 years , and yet it happened . 
  seriously , i remember reading a newspaper about ascension talks in 1993 and my only thought was , `` haha , yeah , i hope i live to see that '' . 
  few things create demand like infrastructure . 
  the area around the end station for warsaw 's first subway line was [ literally a field ] ( http://ursynow.org.pl/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.downloaditem&amp;g2_itemid=5791 ) . 
  check it out [ on google street view 17 years later ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/place/kabaty/@52.1312362,21.0659796,3a,90y,341.17h,84.54t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1stys_e9ooli43w5wfwpqxoa!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x47192d98eeb10895:0x7860025ac04451c7!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  i had lived in the us for 7 years when we came to poland and i saw president george bush in warsaw and the pope in krak\u00f3w . 
  saw the mayor of copenhagen outside city hall when i rode my bike there 3 years ago too . 
  now i 've been in warsaw for 22 years and i have n't seen our president , prime minister or mayor . 
  i 'm surprised that 1 in 8 students has a partner from a different nationality . 
  the hardcore history series is currently covering wwi ~ ~ i ~ ~ and there 's talk of this phenomenon , it 's really quite interesting . 
  * edit : wrong war . 
  russia is that uncle who used to sexually abuse us and we 're just really glad he 's not allowed to visit anymore . 
  up until the 20th century england and france were natural enemies and germany really fucked up its relations with england via the two world wars . 
  you could 've been pals . 
  then you go to prague and it 's a gorgeous city full of buildings from the past century . 
  and then you come back to warsaw and you have a rebuilt old town that 's falling apart here and there , because it was very quickly rebuilt after wwii , and now its residents are keeping it hostage from being a fun place varsovians actually want to visit . 
  poles need to learn to fight smart , not hard . 
  and complain about not being able to compete against commercial tv stations . 
  guess what , that 's not your fucking job !, 
  nothing , i ca n't imagine that would be a high priority line . 
  if it were , it would n't be going through e\u0142k like it is now ... 
  go to outlet shops . 
  my friend 's mom bought a coat for autumn and her first reaction was , `` oh , i saw that coat in an outlet shop in barcelona for 15 $ '' . 
  her mom had paid 30 . 
  ** poland ** * some 12500 soldiers ( including nato forces ) will be taking part in war games in poland . 
  * ewa kopacz looks to be our next prime minister after donald tusk ( pm since 2007 ) was selected to be the president of the european commission . 
  tusk resigned and president komorowski accepted his resignation on thursday . 
  * the date for high speed rail in poland has finally been announced . 
  warsaw to krak\u00f3w in under 2\u00a01/2 hours , warsaw to gda\u0144sk under 3 hours and to wroc\u0142aw in 3:42 . 
  only that last number is really impressive , with the first two routes only shaving 15-30 minutes off the times pkp had in the early 1990s . 
  * the 25th anniversary of the first free , post-wwii government ( in poland and the entire region ) lead by [ tadeusz mazowiecki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadeusz_mazowiecki ) was celebrated by recreating [ his office ] ( http://tvnwarszawa.tvn24.pl/informacje,news,popielniczka-mazowieckiego-trafila-na-wystawe-zobacz-gabinet-sprzed-25-lat,142183.html ) ( pl ) as a museum piece . 
  * an american blackhawk helicopter was forced to land a few in a rapeseed field near grudzi\u0105dz after fog made flying impossible . 
  * our public tv wants to increase their income by taxing businesses whether they own a tv/radio or not . 
  * pis ( our quasi-right wing party de jour ) won all three senate seats in special by-elections held last weekend . 
  sobieski is barf juice . 
  if someone brings that to a party i make sure they 're the ones drinking it . 
  sorry , eastern european hell is where the food is czech . 
  czechs make great wine , but their only culinary success has been boiling bread . 
  the lead actor in that film ( stanis\u0142aw tym ) once gave an interview where he talked about how they 'd get letters from all over poland , asking how they managed to deal with the issue of soup leaking from the screw . 
  he said he did n't expect them to treat it as an instructional video . 
  maybe it 's time for poles to stop obsessing over sports we suck at ? 
  i personally know three people who write papers ( including master 's dissertations ) for money . 
  hell , my gf was offered a gig like that two months ago . 
  it is a * massive * problem and has seriously damaged the reputation polish universities have . 
  when i was 9 months back in poland after spending 9 years in the us , my math teacher asked me why i did n't have my homework . 
  i replied that i did n't finish it at home last night , and i did n't want to copy it from anybody before class . 
  you could 've heard a pin drop . 
  i agree . 
  my friend did his ba ( * licencjat * ) at politechnika \u0141\u00f3dzka and they were n't allowed to use laptops during lectures . 
  most of his education was extremely theoretical and much of it outdated . 
  he went to do his master 's at kth in stockholm and he said it was a world apart . 
  instead of 120 people in a lecture hall and a bored lecturer droning on about network architecture , he worked in 4-person international teams on real projects and went to a local business ( where he works to this day ) to actually do the master 's project . 
  those hard science degrees from eastern unis are n't bad ... but my friend wrote her marketing master 's dissertation in two weeks with the help of her friend and her 17 year old sister . 
  check your non-swole privilege . 
  barcelona is interesting because of it 's massive subway system - 13 lines iirc - and because it is amazingly dense . 
  helsinki 's population density is around 3600 people/km ^ 2 - in barcelona it 's 16,000 . 
  every train i took in that city was crowded , and the streets are still slammed with cars . 
  too bad they did n't write this 5 years ago , it would 've read  the neighborhood of kreuzberg -- a center of global hipsterdom, 
  because taxi drivers are n't mostly conspiracy theorists who are completely full of shit ? 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's just misinformation . 
  if it says taxi , it 's a taxi . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're thinking of [ eko ] ( http://www.ekocabtaxi.pl/ ) , which is not a taxi but `` personal transportation '' . 
  [ this is what warsaw cabs look like ] ( http://cdn20.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/thumbnails/169322/taxi_taksowka_protest_taksowkarzy_w_640x0_rozmiar-niestandardowy.jpg ) - they used to just say ` taxi ' but now they 're all branded . 
  i kind of wish warsaw ( and other cities ) had paint job regulations for our taxis . 
  i think in germany ( or at least berlin ) they have to be beige and we all know nyc 's iconic yellow cab . 
  here that ford mondeo is just one company ( eko taxi ) , otherwise you just get ... whatever . 
  although , to be fair , most cab companies wo n't let really crappy cars drive for them , so it 's not like lviv where i saw a daewoo tico as a cab a few years ago . 
  russia who ? 
  yeah , it seems like most european drug policy is based on us drug policy ... which is now going back to being more liberal . 
  i 'm sure the polish government will catch up by 2070 ... ish . 
  legal guns do n't cost that little anywhere in europe . 
  and i 'm pretty sure you can drive a shitty 25 $ car anywhere around europe as long as it 's been legally approved to be driven in whatever country you bought it in . 
  limits in the uk pertain to the sale and carrying of knives , not ownership - stick it in a carton in the back of your 25 $ car and you 're good to go . 
   this is not a human rights issue ( since we do not go as prison happy as the us ) maybe not for you , but you can get three years in prison for possession of more than half a gram of marijuana . 
  is there anything else that you can buy legally in one country for under 25 $ , take it across a border and end up doing 3 years in prison for just owning it ? 
  you shall have no lord above me except for the pope , but only the polish one . 
  or just work at a private clinic . 
  except that the doctor has performed multiple abortions during his career and the law has changed half a dozen times during that time . 
  look at it other way : if you hire someone to drive a bus and they decide to become an orthodox jew during their career , do you not fire them for pulling the bus over and refusing to drive at sunset on a friday night ? 
  what about your fry cook going muslim and refusing to handle pork ? 
  or the vatican calling on all catholics to respect the lord 's day , and suddenly your employee is refusing to work sundays ? 
  you would n't have this story in the us - there are no state run hospitals in the us outside of the va , and those are banned from performing abortions by law . 
  yeah , but catching pigeons is hard work and they do n't have much meat on them !, 
  why do you say that ? 
  horse meat is a lot more expensive to produce than beef . 
  just like i never understood all the slights that cheap asian food shops sell dog or pigeon - the work needed to catch and prepare those animals far exceed the cost of buying the chicken usually used ( usually around ~ 1 $ / kg in european markets ),
